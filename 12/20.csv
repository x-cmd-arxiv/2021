methods of high dimensional stochastic nonlinear Schrodinger equations
(SNLSEs). We first prove that the classical explicit numerical methods are
unstable and suffer from the numerical divergence phenomenon. Then we propose a
kind of explicit splitting numerical methods and prove that the
structure-preserving splitting strategy is able to enhance the numerical
stability. Furthermore, we establish the regularity analysis and strong
convergence analysis of the proposed schemes for SNLSEs based on two key
ingredients. One ingredient is proving new regularity estimates of SNLSEs by
constructing a logarithmic auxiliary functional and exploiting the Bourgain
space. Another one is providing a dedicated error decomposition formula and a
novel truncated stochastic Gronwall's lemma, which relies on the tail estimates
of underlying stochastic processes. In particular, our result answers the
strong convergence problem of numerical methods for 2D SNLSEs emerged from [C.

an unknown function from given scattered data. Radial basis function (RBF)
methods have proven to be highly useful to deal with this problem. We describe
two quantum algorithms to efficiently fit scattered data based on globally and
compactly supported RBFs respectively. For the globally supported RBF method,
the core of the quantum algorithm relies on using coherent states to calculate
the radial functions and a nonsparse matrix exponentiation technique for
efficiently performing a matrix inversion. A quadratic speedup is achieved in
the number of data over the classical algorithms. For the compactly supported

efficient quantum procedure that runs in time logarithmic in the number of

localize lung nodules with chest radiographs(CXRs). We expected it to enhance
the efficiency of interpreting CXRs and reduce the possibilities of delayed
diagnosis of lung cancer.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected CXRs from NCKUH database and VBD, an
open-source medical image dataset, as our training and validation data. A
number of CXRs from the Ministry of Health and Welfare(MOHW) database served as
our test data. We built a segmentation model to identify lung areas from CXRs,
and sliced them into 16 patches. Physicians labeled the CXRs by clicking the
patches. These labeled patches were then used to train and fine-tune a deep
neural network(DNN) model, classifying the patches as positive or negative.
Finally, we test the DNN model with the lung patches of CXRs from MOHW.
  RESULTS: Our segmentation model identified the lung regions well from the
whole CXR. The Intersection over Union(IoU) between the ground truth and the
segmentation result was 0.9228. In addition, our DNN model achieved a
sensitivity of 0.81, specificity of 0.82, and AUROC of 0.869 in 98 of 125
cases. For the other 27 difficult cases, the sensitivity was 0.54, specificity
0.494, and AUROC 0.682. Overall, we obtained a sensitivity of 0.78, specificity
of 0.79, and AUROC 0.837.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our two-step workflow is comparable to state-of-the-art
algorithms in the sensitivity and specificity of localizing lung nodules from
CXRs. Notably, our workflow provides an efficient way for specialists to label
the data, which is valuable for relevant researches because of the relative
rarity of labeled medical image data.

model on the one-dimensional sawtooth lattice, which exhibits a flat band by
fine-tuning the hopping rates. We first solve the two-body problem, both
analytically and numerically, to extract the binding energy and the effective
mass of the pairs. Based on the DMRG method, we address the ground-state
properties of the many-body system, assuming equal spin populations. We compare
our results with those available for a linear chain, where the model is
integrable by Bethe ansatz, and show that the multiband nature of the system
substantially modifies the physics of the BCS-BEC crossover. Near a flat band,
the chemical potential remains always close to its zero-density limit predicted
by the two-body physics. In contrast, the pairing gap exhibits a remarkably
strong density dependence and, differently from the pair binding energy, it is
no longer peaked at the flat-band point. We show that these results can be
interpreted in terms of polarization screening effects, due to an anomalous
attraction between pairs in the medium and single fermions. Importantly, we
unveil that three-body bound states (trimers) exist in the sawtooth lattice, in
sharp contrast with the linear chain geometry, and we compute their binding
energy. The nature of these states is investigated via a strong coupling
variational approach, revealing that they originate from tunneling-induced
exchange processes.

indivisible goods to asymmetric agents. The Nash welfare of an allocation is
the weighted geometric mean of agents' utilities, and the allocation with
maximum Nash welfare is known to satisfy several desirable fairness and
efficiency properties. However, computing such an MNW allocation is NP-hard,
even for two agents with identical, additive valuations. Hence, we aim to
identify tractable classes that either admit a PTAS, an FPTAS, or an exact
polynomial-time algorithm.
  To this end, we design a PTAS for finding an MNW allocation for the case of
asymmetric agents with identical, additive valuations, thus generalizing a
similar result for symmetric agents. Our techniques can also be adapted to give
a PTAS for the problem of computing the optimal $p$-mean welfare. We also show
that an MNW allocation can be computed exactly in polynomial time for identical
agents with $k$-ary valuations when $k$ is a constant, where every agent has at
most $k$ different values for the goods. Next, we consider the special case
where every agent finds at most two goods valuable, and show that this class
admits an efficient algorithm, even for general monotone valuations. In
contrast, we note that when agents can value three or more goods, maximizing
Nash welfare is NP-hard, even when agents are symmetric and have additive
valuations, showing our algorithmic result is essentially tight.
  Finally, we show that for constantly many asymmetric agents with additive
valuations, the MNW problem admits an FPTAS.

can achieve superior recognition accuracy compared to modular systems. However,
these models do not ensure real-time applicability due to their dependency on
full audio context. This work takes real-time applicability as the first
priority in model design and addresses a few challenges in previous work on
multi-speaker recurrent neural network transducer (MS-RNN-T). First, we
introduce on-the-fly overlapping speech simulation during training, yielding
14% relative word error rate (WER) improvement on LibriSpeechMix test set.
Second, we propose a novel multi-turn RNN-T (MT-RNN-T) model with an
overlap-based target arrangement strategy that generalizes to an arbitrary
number of speakers without changes in the model architecture. We investigate
the impact of the maximum number of speakers seen during training on MT-RNN-T

the two-speaker MS-RNN-T. Third, we experiment with a rich transcription

an in-depth analysis, we discuss potential pitfalls of the proposed system as
well as promising future research directions.

rewriting logic theories that can improve system analysis and verification. In
Presto, the automated optimization of a conditional rewrite theory R (whose
rules define the concurrent transitions of a system) is achieved by partially
evaluating, with respect to the rules of R, an underlying, companion equational
logic theory E that specifies the algebraic structure of the system states of
R. This can be particularly useful for specializing an overly general
equational theory E whose operators may obey complex combinations of
associativity, commutativity, and/or identity axioms, when being plugged into a
host rewrite theory R as happens, for instance, in protocol analysis, where
sophisticated equational theories for cryptography are used. Presto implements
different unfolding operators that are based on folding variant narrowing (the
symbolic engine of Maude's equational theories). When combined with an
appropriate abstraction algorithm, they allow the specialization to be adapted
to the theory termination behavior and bring significant improvement while
ensuring strong correctness and termination of the specialization. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of Presto in several examples of protocol
analysis where it achieves a significant speed-up. Actually, the transformation
provided by Presto may cut down an infinite folding variant narrowing space to
a finite one, and moreover, some of the costly algebraic axioms and rule
conditions may be eliminated as well. As far as we know, this is the first
partial evaluator for Maude that respects the semantics of functional, logic,

Rendering (HVTR), which synthesizes virtual human avatars from arbitrary poses
efficiently and at high quality. First, we learn to encode articulated human
motions on a dense UV manifold of the human body surface. To handle complicated
motions (e.g., self-occlusions), we then leverage the encoded information on
the UV manifold to construct a 3D volumetric representation based on a dynamic
pose-conditioned neural radiance field. While this allows us to represent 3D
geometry with changing topology, volumetric rendering is computationally heavy.
Hence we employ only a rough volumetric representation using a pose-conditioned
downsampled neural radiance field (PD-NeRF), which we can render efficiently at
low resolutions. In addition, we learn 2D textural features that are fused with
rendered volumetric features in image space. The key advantage of our approach
is that we can then convert the fused features into a high-resolution,
high-quality avatar by a fast GAN-based textural renderer. We demonstrate that
hybrid rendering enables HVTR to handle complicated motions, render
high-quality avatars under user-controlled poses/shapes and even loose
clothing, and most importantly, be efficient at inference time. Our

gravity theory, since the curvature effects are significant and more
importantly, potentially testable. In most cases studied in the literature in
the context of massive scalar-tensor theories, inflationary models were
examined. The most important of scalar-tensor models is the Higgs model, which,
depending on the values of the scalar field, can be approximated by different
scalar potentials, one of which is the inflationary. Since it is not certain
how large the values of the scalar field will be at the near vicinity and
inside a neutron star, in this work we will answer the question, which
potential form of the Higgs model is more appropriate in order for it to
describe consistently a static neutron star. As we will show numerically, the
non-inflationary Higgs potential, which is valid for certain values of the
scalar field in the Jordan frame, leads to extremely large maximum neutron star
masses, however the model is not self-consistent, because the scalar field
approximation used for the derivation of the potential, is violated both at the
center and at the surface of the star. These results shows the uniqueness of
the inflationary Higgs potential, since it is the only approximation for the
Higgs model, that provides self-consistent results.

Conformal Prediction (CP) is a methodology that allows to estimate a confidence

the data is exchangeable. CP sets have guaranteed coverage for any finite
population size $n$. While appealing, the computation of such a set turns out
to be infeasible in general, e.g. when the unknown variable $y_{n+1}$ is

computing an infinite number of models, which often makes it intractable. In

We find that, whilst the statistics of the CMB convergence field are

bispectrum estimators can receive a systematic bias from the Doppler induced

Similarly, there are several suggestions to employ the classification of

boundary modes. Here, we show that the surface 1H termination of the transition
metal dichalcogenide compound 4Hb-TaS$_2$, in which 1T-TaS$_2$ and 1H-TaS$_2$

of states within the superconducting gap. An exponentially decaying bound mode
is imaged within the superconducting gap along the boundaries of the exposed 1H
layer characteristic of a gapless Majorana edge mode. The anisotropic nature of
the localization length of the edge mode aims towards topological nodal
superconductivity. A zero-bias conductance peak is further imaged within fairly
isotropic vortex cores. All our observations are accommodated by a theoretical
model of a two-dimensional nodal Weyl-like superconducting state, which ensues
from inter-orbital Cooper pairing. The observation of an intrinsic topological
nodal superconductivity in a layered material will pave the way for further
studies of Majorana edge modes and its applications in quantum information

dynamics and superconducting circuits to biological organisms. Optical systems
driven out of equilibrium such as lasers and supercontinuum generation exhibit
chaotic states of light with fluctuations of both amplitude and phase and can
give rise to Levy statistics, turbulence, and rogue waves. Spatio-temporal
chaos also occurs in continuous-wave driven photonic chip based Kerr
micro-resonators, where it is referred to as chaotic modulation instability.
Such modulation instability states have generally been considered impractical
for applications, in contrast to their coherent light state counterparts, which
include soliton or dark-pulse states. Here we demonstrate that incoherent and
chaotic states of light in an optical microresonator can be harnessed to
implement unambiguous and interference-immune massively parallel coherent laser
ranging by using the intrinsic random amplitude and phase modulation of the
chaotic comb lines. We utilize 40 distinct lines of a microresonator frequency
comb operated in the modulation instability regime. Each line carries more than
1 GHz noise bandwidth, which greatly surpasses the cavity linewidth, and
enables to retrieve the distance of objects with cm-scale resolution. Our
approach utilizes one of the most widely accessible microcomb states, and
offers -- in contrast to dissipative Kerr soliton states -- high conversion
efficiency, as well as flat optical spectra, and alleviates the need for
complex laser initiation routines. Moreover the approach generates wideband
signal modulation without requiring any electro-optical modulator or microwave
synthesizer. Viewed more broadly, similar optical systems capable of chaotic
dynamics could be applied to random modulation optical ranging as well as
spread spectrum communication and optical cryptography systems.

distances only, while it usually vanishes as the distance between sites
increases arbitrarily. However, models proposed in the literature for spatial
extremes, which are based on max-stable or Pareto processes or comparatively
less computationally demanding ``sub-asymptotic'' models based on Gaussian
location and/or scale mixtures, generally assume that spatial extremal
dependence persists across the entire spatial domain. This is a clear
limitation when modeling extremes over large geographical domains, but
surprisingly, it has been mostly overlooked in the literature. In this paper,
we develop a more realistic Bayesian framework based on a novel Gaussian scale
mixture model, where the Gaussian process component is defined by a stochastic
partial differential equation that yields a sparse precision matrix, and the
random scale component is modeled as a low-rank Pareto-tailed or Weibull-tailed
spatial process determined by compactly supported basis functions. We show that
our proposed model is approximately tail-stationary despite its non-stationary
construction in terms of basis functions, and we demonstrate that it can
capture a wide range of extremal dependence structures as a function of
distance. Furthermore, the inherently sparse structure of our spatial model
allows fast Bayesian computations, even in high spatial dimensions, based on a
customized Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which prioritize calibration in
the tail. In our application, we fit our model to analyze heavy monsoon
rainfall data in Bangladesh. Our study indicates that the proposed model
outperforms some natural alternatives, and that the model fits precipitation
extremes satisfactorily well. Finally, we use the fitted model to draw
inferences on long-term return levels for marginal precipitation at each site,

coverage probability expressions for THz network in the presence of molecular
absorption noise and highlight its significant impact on the users'
performance. Specifically, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the
Laplace Transform of the cumulative molecular noise and interference observed
by a mobile user in a hybrid RF-THz network. Furthermore, we provide a novel
approximation to derive the conditional distance distributions of a typical
user in a hybrid RF-THz network. Finally, using the overall HO probability and
coverage probability expressions, the mobility-aware probability of coverage
has been derived in a hybrid RF-THz network. Our mathematical results validate
the correctness of the derived expressions using Monte-Carlo simulations. The
results offer insights into the adverse impact of users' mobility and molecular
noise in THz transmissions on the probability of coverage of mobile users. Our
results demonstrate that a small increase in the intensity of terahertz
base-stations (TBSs) (about 5 times) can increase the HO probability much more

redshift. However, for this technique to work, it is essential that the PISN
mass-scale is redshift independent or at least has a predictable redshift
dependence. We show that the observed PISN mass-scale can get smeared and the
position of the PISN mass-scale is likely to exhibit a strong redshift
dependence due to a combined effect from the non-zero value of the delay time
between the formation of a star and the merging of two black holes and the
metallicity dependence of PISN mass scale. Due to the unknown form of the
delay-time distribution, the redshift dependence of the PISN mass cut-off of
the binary black holes (BBHs) cannot be well characterized and will exhibit a
large variation with the change in redshift. As a result, the use of a fixed
PISN mass scale to infer the redshift of the BBHs from the observed masses will
be systematically biased. Though this uncertainty is not severe for the third
observation run conducted by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, in the future
this uncertainty will cause a systematic error in the redshift inferred from
the PISN mass scale. The corresponding systematic error will be a bottleneck in
achieving a few percent precision measurements of the cosmological parameters

gravitational analogon to a hypothetical magnetic charge in electrodynamics,
exists in nature. It naturally occurs in certain exact solutions to Einstein's
electrovacuum field equations with cosmological constant. The charged NUT-de
Sitter metric is such a solution. It describes a black hole with electric and
gravitomagnetic charges and a cosmological constant. In this paper we will
address the question how we can observe the gravitomagnetic charge using
gravitational lensing. For this purpose we first solve the equations of motion
for lightlike geodesics using Legendre's canonical forms of the elliptic
integrals and Jacobi's elliptic functions. We fix a stationary observer in the
domain of outer communication and introduce an orthonormal tetrad. The
orthonormal tetrad relates the direction under which the observer detects a
light ray to its latitude-longitude coordinates on the observer's celestial
sphere. In this parameterisation we rederive the angular radius of the shadow,
formulate a lens map, discuss the redshift and the travel time. We also discuss
relevant differences with respect to spherically symmetric and static
spacetimes and how we can use them to determine if an astrophysical black hole
has a gravitomagnetic charge.

non-physical effects that can mislead optimal model decisions. A prominent
misleading effect is unintended storage cycling that was observed in previous
literature by simultaneous charging and discharging of the same storage in 12
of 18 energy models. Especially for popular net-zero energy model scenarios,
unintended storage cycling can cause high distortions and, hence, urges for its
removal. Methods to remove such misleading effects exist, but are not
computational efficient and sometimes not effective such as MILP formulations.
Other techniques are successful, but only if renewable energy target
constraints exist. This paper explores how to eradicate unintended storage
cycling for models without renewable target constraints by correctly setting
variable costs of relevant system components. We find through 124 simulations
that determining appropriate levels of variable costs depends on the solver
accuracy used for the optimization. If set too loose, the solver prevents the
removal of unintended storage cycling. We further find that reliable data for
variable costs in energy modelling needs to be improved and provide a list of
recommended model inputs as well as a minimum variable cost threshold that can
significantly reduce the magnitude and likeliness of unintended storage
cycling. Finally, our results suggest that variable cost additives may remove
other known unintended energy cycling effects, such as unintended line cycling
or sector cycling.

mostly static graph layouts to present the data to the user. This poses a
problem since there is no optimal layout for all possible tasks. The choice of
layout heavily depends on the type of network and the task at hand. We
introduce a multi-layout approach that allows users to effectively explore

different layout techniques and interactions to efficiently use the available
space in VR and provide an optimal view of the data depending on the task and
the level of detail required to solve it. To evaluate our approach, we have
conducted a user study comparing it against the state of the art for immersive

microstrip antenna is designed by cascading J-shaped metallic and IDC unit
cells. Then it is simulated by full-wave ADS Momentum software. Advantageously,
the proposed structure has tunable dispersion diagram that can be tuned by the
number of IDC fingers. As will be clarified, altering the number of IDC fingers
is able to adapt the equivalent capacitor of the antenna equivalent circuit.
Thanks to the availability of RF switches technologies, changing the
configuration of the IDCs can be practical. Furthermore, scanning the space
from backward to forward region through broadside is one of the distinguishing
features of the antenna. Indeed, the CRLH LWA continuously scans the space
through broadside from -55 degree to +65 degree in {\phi} = 0 degree plane. The
results of the investigation reveal that the LWA with two fingers, as more
effective configuration, is a circularly polarized CRLH LWA and it is one of
the highly desirable advantages of this structure. The axial ratio in the
direction of the main beam for the backward region is lower than 3dB and it is
improved in comparison to other regions. The deployment of IDC with variable

portions of the sky every night. These novel approaches lead to a huge increase
of the global alert rates which need to be handled with care especially by
keeping the false alarms as low as possible. Therefore, the standard transient
detection pipelines previously designed for narrow field of view instruments
must now integrate more sophisticated tools to deal with the growing number and
diversity of alerts and false alarms. Deep machine learning algorithms have now
proven their efficiency in recognizing patterns in images. We explore this
method to provide a robust and flexible algorithm that could be included in any
kind of transient detection pipeline. We built a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) algorithm in order to perform a real/bogus classification task on
transient candidate cutouts (subtraction residuals) provided by different kinds
of optical telescopes. The training involved human-supervised labeling of the
cutouts, which had been split in two balanced data sets with \textit{True} and
\textit{False} point-like source candidates. We tested our CNN model on the
candidates produced by two different transient detection pipelines. We show
that our CNN algorithm can be successfully trained on a large diversity of
images having very different pixel scales. Tested on optical images from four
different telescopes and utilising two different transient detection pipelines,
our CNN model provides robust real/bogus classification performance accuracy
from 93% up to 98% of well classified candidates.

history and the origins of Earth's volatiles. Visible to near-infrared
observations at wavelengths of $<2.5\ {\rm \mu m}$ have suggested a genetic
link between outer main belt asteroids located at $2.5$-$4\ {\rm au}$ and
carbonaceous chondrite meteorites (CCs) that show isotopic similarities to
volatile elements on Earth. However, recent longer wavelength data for large
outer main belt asteroids show $3.1\ {\rm \mu m}$ absorption features of
ammoniated phyllosilicates that are absent in CCs and cannot easily form from
materials stable at those present distances. Here, by combining data collected
by the AKARI space telescope and hydrological, geochemical, and spectral models
of water-rock reactions, we show that the surface materials of asteroids having
$3.1\ {\rm \mu m}$ absorption features and CCs can originate from different
regions of a single, water-rock-differentiated parent body. Ammoniated
phyllosilicates form within the water-rich mantles of the differentiated bodies
containing NH$_3$ and CO$_2$ under high water-rock ratios ($>4$) and low
temperatures ($<70^\circ$C). CCs can originate from the rock-dominated cores,
that are likely to be preferentially sampled as meteorites by disruption and
transport processes. Our results suggest that multiple large main belt
asteroids formed beyond the NH$_3$ and CO$_2$ snow lines (currently $>10$ au)
and could be transported to their current locations. Earth's high hydrogen to
carbon ratio may be explained by accretion of these water-rich progenitors.

  Letters. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2011.06179",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we consider two coupled problems for distributed multi-robot
systems (MRSs) coordinating with limited field of view (FOV) sensors: adaptive
tuning of interaction gains and rejection of sensor attacks. First, a typical
shortcoming of distributed control frameworks (e.g., potential fields) is that
the overall system behavior is highly sensitive to the gain assigned to
relative interactions. Second, MRSs with limited FOV sensors can be more
susceptible to sensor attacks aimed at their FOVs, and therefore must be
resilient to such attacks. Based on these shortcomings, we propose a
comprehensive solution that combines efforts in adaptive gain tuning and attack
resilience to the problem of topology control for MRSs with limited FOVs.
Specifically, we first derive an adaptive gain tuning scheme based on
satisfying nominal pairwise interactions, which yields a dynamic balancing of
interaction strengths in a robot's neighborhood. We then model additive sensor
and actuator attacks (or faults) and derive H infinity control protocols by
employing a static output-feedback technique, guaranteeing bounded L2 gains of
the error induced by the attack (fault) signals. Finally, simulation results
using ROS Gazebo are provided to support our theoretical findings.

discontinuity along a nonsmooth curve $\mathcal S_\epsilon$. The assumptions
are that (a) $\mathcal S_\epsilon$ is an $O(\epsilon)$-size perturbation of a
smooth curve $\mathcal S$, and (b) $\mathcal S_\epsilon$ is Holder continuous
with some exponent $\gamma\in(0,1]$. We compute the Discrete Transition
Behavior (or, DTB) defined as the limit $\text{DTB}(\check
x):=\lim_{\epsilon\to0}f_\epsilon(x_0+\epsilon\check x)$, where $x_0$ is
generic. We illustrate the DTB by two sets of numerical experiments. In the
first set, the perturbation is a smooth, rapidly oscillating sinusoid, and in
the second - a fractal curve. The experiments reveal that the match between the
DTB and reconstruction is worse as $\mathcal S_\epsilon$ gets more rough. This
is in agreement with the proof of the DTB, which suggests that the rate of
convergence to the limit is $O(\epsilon^{\gamma/2})$. We then propose a new
DTB, which exhibits an excellent agreement with reconstructions. Investigation
of this phenomenon requires computing the rate of convergence for the new DTB.
This, in turn, requires completely new approaches. We obtain a partial result
along these lines and formulate a conjecture that the rate of convergence of
the new DTB is $O(\epsilon^{1/2}\ln(1/\epsilon))$.

we show that even at low-power IR pumping with absorbed fluences in the mkJ

pumping to the giant nonlinearity of Dirac fermions in the Dirac surface states

bound valence electrons in the bulk into the conduction band. Two mechanisms of
absorption bleaching were also revealed since they manifest themselves in
different spectral regions of probing. These two mechanisms were assigned to
the filling of the phase-space in the Dirac SS and bulk states and the

In this work, we explore whether measurements of galaxy peculiar velocities
could allow us to improve upon neutrino mass constraints from galaxy redshift
surveys alone. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that the galaxy peculiar
motions $\textit{do}$ contain information on the sum of the masses of neutrinos
$\sum m_{\nu}$, and that this information can be used to improve upon
constraints that may be obtained from low-redshift galaxy surveys ($z<0.5$)
combined with $\textit{Planck}$ measurements of the Cosmic Microwave
Background. Compared to the full constraining power offered by
$\textit{Planck}$ and higher redshift DESI data, we find that the benefit of
including peculiar velocities only marginally improves neutrino mass
constraints. However, when one does not include information from
$\textit{Planck}$, our results show that the inclusion of peculiar velocity
measurements can substantially improve upon the constraints from redshift
surveys alone, and that in some cases the addition of further data from high
density peculiar velocity surveys is more successful at overcoming the sample
variance than adding further data from redshifts only. We demonstrate that it
may be possible to achieve upper bounds of $\sum m_{\nu} \approx $0.14 eV (68%
confidence limit), from upcoming spectroscopic galaxy surveys alone, as long as
the peculiar velocity data is available, an improvement of $\sim$14% over
redshift surveys alone, but not as strong as when CMB data is included.

emerging applications such as precision agriculture, search and rescue, and

unknown and unstructured environments with a broad and sophisticated set of
objectives, all under strict computation and power limitations. We therefore
argue that the computational kernels enabling robotic autonomy must be
scheduled and optimized to guarantee timely and correct behavior, while
allowing for reconfiguration of scheduling parameters at run time. In this
paper, we consider a necessary first step towards this goal of computational
awareness in autonomous robots: an empirical study of a base set of
computational kernels from the resource management perspective. Specifically,
we conduct a data-driven study of the timing, power, and memory performance of
kernels for localization and mapping, path planning, task allocation, depth
estimation, and optical flow, across three embedded computing platforms. We
profile and analyze these kernels to provide insight into scheduling and
dynamic resource management for computation-aware autonomous robots. Notably,
our results show that there is a correlation of kernel performance with a
robot's operational environment, justifying the notion of computation-aware
robots and why our work is a crucial step towards this goal.

Mexico (GoM) is investigated through five ensembles of regional ocean
simulations between 2014 and 2016. The ensembles explore two horizontal
resolutions and different representations of the riverine inflow, and focus on
the Loop Current system (LCS) and the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River System
(MARS) interactions.
  The predictability of the surface fields is high in the northern GoM if the
atmospheric forcing and the flow at Yucatan Channel are known, and the
ensembles simulate similar LCS behavior up to 5 months. In terms of LCS-MARS
interactions, the ensembles confirm that they are strongly modulated by the LC
mesoscale variability. The relationship is two-ways, with the LCS being
influenced by - and not only influencing - the freshwater plume. Whenever the
freshwater flux is strong, the northward extension of the LCS is constrained.
The ensemble simulations also indicate that this influence is stronger if the
riverine inflow is simulated in an active fashion with a meridional velocity
component proportional to the flux. Sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity
(SSS) predictability have opposite seasonality in their signal, with the SST
(SSS) field being more predictable in summer (winter). Partially resolving
submesoscale instabilities and improving the accuracy of the riverine fluxes'
representation causes the spread to increase, especially in SST. Finally, the
predictability of surface relative vorticity decreases in amplitude when
increasing resolution due to feedbacks between the mesoscale and submesoscale
circulations, but retains most of its intraseasonal and interannual signal.

to restore missing regions in face images. Encoders are often utilized to learn
powerful representations that play an important role in meeting the challenges
of sophisticated learning tasks. Specifically, various kinds of masks are often
presented in face images in the wild, forming complex patterns, especially in
this hard period of COVID-19. It's difficult for encoders to capture such
powerful representations under this complex situation. To address this
challenge, we propose a self-supervised Siamese inference network to improve
the generalization and robustness of encoders. It can encode contextual
semantics from full-resolution images and obtain more discriminative
representations. To deal with geometric variations of face images, a dense
correspondence field is integrated into the network. We further propose a
multi-scale decoder with a novel dual attention fusion module (DAF), which can
combine the restored and known regions in an adaptive manner. This multi-scale
architecture is beneficial for the decoder to utilize discriminative
representations learned from encoders into images. Extensive experiments
clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach not only achieves more appealing
results compared with state-of-the-art methods but also improves the
performance of masked face recognition dramatically.

components. It is natural to ask which one it is, and whether we can determine
this by certain linear invariants. In this note we use Hochschild homology of
derived category of coherent sheaves with support to provide another proof that
if the $-\n^{\th}$ Hochschild homology of a component is nonzero, then the
skyscraper sheaves we consider above belong to such component, which was
originally proved by Dmitrii Pirozhkov \cite[Lemma

privacy-preserving paradigm to effectively incorporate the distributed data at
the network edge for training deep learning models. Nevertheless, the limited
coverage of a single edge server results in an insufficient number of
participated client nodes, which may impair the learning performance. In this
paper, we investigate a novel framework of FEEL, namely semi-decentralized
federated edge learning (SD-FEEL), where multiple edge servers are employed to
collectively coordinate a large number of client nodes. By exploiting the
low-latency communication among edge servers for efficient model sharing,
SD-FEEL can incorporate more training data, while enjoying much lower latency
compared with conventional federated learning. We detail the training algorithm
for SD-FEEL with three main steps, including local model update, intra-cluster,
and inter-cluster model aggregations. The convergence of this algorithm is
proved on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, which
also helps to reveal the effects of key parameters on the training efficiency
and provides practical design guidelines. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity of edge
devices may cause the straggler effect and deteriorate the convergence speed of
SD-FEEL. To resolve this issue, we propose an asynchronous training algorithm
with a staleness-aware aggregation scheme for SD-FEEL, of which, the
convergence performance is also analyzed. The simulation results demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms for SD-FEEL and
corroborate our analysis.

population of eagles in a given search space, the best eagle is selected and
undergoes a local food search using the interior point method as its means of
exploitation. The population is then divided into three subpopulations, and
each subpopulation is assigned an operator which aids in the exploration. Once
the respective operators are applied, the new eagles with improved function
values replace the older ones. The best eagle of the population is then updated
and conducts a local food search again. These steps are done iteratively, and
the food searched by the final best eagle is the optimal solution of the search
space. PEOA is tested on 20 optimization test functions with different
modality, separability, and dimension properties. The performance of PEOA is
compared to 11 other optimization algorithms. To further validate the
effectiveness of PEOA, it is also applied to image reconstruction in electrical
impedance tomography and parameter identification in a neutral delay

accurate solutions to various functions and problems. PEOA proves to be the

social media. To mitigate their continual spread, detecting previously
fact-checked claims is indispensable. Given a claim, existing works focus on
providing evidence for detection by reranking candidate fact-checking articles
(FC-articles) retrieved by BM25. However, these performances may be limited
because they ignore the following characteristics of FC-articles: (1) claims
are often quoted to describe the checked events, providing lexical information
besides semantics; (2) sentence templates to introduce or debunk claims are
common across articles, providing pattern information. Models that ignore the
two aspects only leverage semantic relevance and may be misled by sentences
that describe similar but irrelevant events. In this paper, we propose a novel
reranker, MTM (Memory-enhanced Transformers for Matching) to rank FC-articles
using key sentences selected with event (lexical and semantic) and pattern
information. For event information, we propose a ROUGE-guided Transformer which
is finetuned with regression of ROUGE. For pattern information, we generate
pattern vectors for matching with sentences. By fusing event and pattern
information, we select key sentences to represent an article and then predict
if the article fact-checks the given claim using the claim, key sentences, and
patterns. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MTM outperforms
existing methods. Human evaluation proves that MTM can capture key sentences
for explanations. The code and the dataset are at

identify a method for evaluating the treatment benefits for two groups in the

called the area between two survival curves (ABS), which is a robust measure of
treatment benefits in clinical trials regardless of whether the proportional
hazards assumption is violated or two survival curves cross each other.
Additionally, we propose a permutation test based on the ABS, and we evaluate
the effectiveness and reliability of this test with simulated data. The ABS
permutation test is a robust statistical inference method with an acceptable
type I error rate and superior power to detect differences in treatment
effects, especially when the proportional hazards assumption is violated. The
ABS can be used to intuitively quantify treatment differences over time and
provide reliable conclusions in complicated situations, such as crossing
survival curves.

VGG16, AlexNet, with an image search engine - Vearch. The dataset that we used
to develop product re-identification systems is a water-bottle dataset that
consists of 400 images of 18 types of water bottles. This is a small dataset,
which was the biggest challenge of our work. However, the combination of neural
networks with Vearch shows potential to tackle the product re-identification
problems. Especially, our new neural network - AlphaAlexNet that a neural

identification accuracy by four percent. This indicates that an ideal
production identification accuracy could be achieved when efficient feature
extraction methods could be introduced and redesigned for image feature
extractions of nearly identical products. In order to solve the biggest
challenges caused by the small size of the dataset and the difficult nature of
identifying productions that have little differences from each other. In our

computer tomography (CT) scans are usually acquired with low intra-slice
resolution. Improving the intra-slice resolution is beneficial to the disease
diagnosis for both human experts and computer-aided systems. To this end, this
paper builds a novel medical slice synthesis to increase the between-slice
resolution. Considering that the ground-truth intermediate medical slices are
always absent in clinical practice, we introduce the incremental cross-view
mutual distillation strategy to accomplish this task in the self-supervised
learning manner. Specifically, we model this problem from three different
views: slice-wise interpolation from axial view and pixel-wise interpolation
from coronal and sagittal views. Under this circumstance, the models learned
from different views can distill valuable knowledge to guide the learning
processes of each other. We can repeat this process to make the models
synthesize intermediate slice data with increasing inter-slice resolution. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on a large-scale CT dataset. Quantitative and
qualitative comparison results show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms by clear margins.

secrecy performance gain compared with the case without RIS. In this

Nevertheless, because most many-body electronic structure methods scale as a

simulating large systems in their thermodynamic limit rapidly becomes
computationally intractable. As a result, researchers typically estimate the
properties of large systems that approach the thermodynamic limit by
extrapolating the properties of smaller, computationally-accessible systems
based on relatively simple scaling expressions. In this work, we employ
Gaussian processes to more accurately and efficiently extrapolate many-body
simulations to their thermodynamic limit. We train our Gaussian processes on
Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors to extrapolate the
energies of one-dimensional hydrogen chains obtained using two many-body
methods: Coupled Cluster theory and Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo
(AFQMC). In so doing, we show that Gaussian processes trained on relatively
short, 10-30-atom chains can predict the energies of hydrogen chains in their
thermodynamic limit with sub-milliHartree accuracy. Unlike standard scaling
expressions, our GPR-based approach is highly generalizable given
representative training data and is not dependent on systems' geometries or
dimensionality. This work highlights the potential for machine learning to
correct for the finite size effects that routinely complicate the

  Purpose: Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was carried out in a team
that has been involved in converting a LINAC between clinical use and UHDR
experimental mode for more than one year, following the proposed methods of
TG100.
  Methods: A team of 9 professionals with extensive experience were polled to
outline the process map and workflow for analysis, and developed fault trees
for potential errors, as well as failure modes that would results. The team
scored the categories of severity magnitude (S), occurrence likelihood (O), and
detectability potential (D) in a scale of 1 to 10, so that a risk priority
number (RPN=S*O*D) could be assessed for each.
  Results: A total of 46 potential failure modes were identified, including 5
with RPN>100. These failure modes involved 1) patient set up, 2) gating
mechanisms in delivery, and 3) detector in the beam stop mechanism. Identified
methods to mitigate errors included 1) use of a checklist post conversion, 2)
use of robust radiation detectors, 3) automation of QA and beam consistency
checks, and 4) implementation of surface guidance during beam delivery.
  Conclusions: The FMEA process was considered critically important in this
setting of a new use of a LINAC, and the expert team developed a higher level
of confidence in the ability to safely move UHDR LINAC use towards expanded
research access.

high-dimensional models, and models featuring large data sets. These
approximate methods are the subject of this review. The aim is to help new

to the presence of outliers/unexpected observations. The robit link function,
which is equal to the inverse CDF of the Student's $t$-distribution, provides a
robust alternative to the probit and logistic link functions. A multivariate
normal prior for the regression coefficients is the standard choice for
Bayesian inference in robit regression models. The resulting posterior density
is intractable and a Data Augmentation (DA) Markov chain is used to generate
approximate samples from the desired posterior distribution. Establishing
geometric ergodicity for this DA Markov chain is important as it provides
theoretical guarantees for asymptotic validity of MCMC standard errors for
desired posterior expectations/quantiles. Previous work [Roy(2012)] established
geometric ergodicity of this robit DA Markov chain assuming (i) the sample size
$n$ dominates the number of predictors $p$, and (ii) an additional constraint
which requires the sample size to be bounded above by a fixed constant which
depends on the design matrix $X$. In particular, modern high-dimensional
settings where $n < p$ are not considered. In this work, we show that the robit
DA Markov chain is trace-class (i.e., the eigenvalues of the corresponding
Markov operator are summable) for arbitrary choices of the sample size $n$, the
number of predictors $p$, the design matrix $X$, and the prior mean and
variance parameters. The trace-class property implies geometric ergodicity.
Moreover, this property allows us to conclude that the sandwich robit chain

the DA chain) is strictly better than the robit DA chain in an appropriate

the weighting coefficients applied in the penalty terms of the cost function.
Adopting a simplified procedure for estimating the weighting coefficients based
on molecular orbital levels allowed these core-level states to be successfully

of interest to measure the dependence among variables by modeling a
multivariate distribution using a copula. The copula models with parametric
assumptions are easy to estimate but can be highly biased when such assumptions
are false, while the empirical copulas are non-smooth and often not genuine
copula making the inference about dependence challenging in practice. As a
compromise, the empirical Bernstein copula provides a smooth estimator but the
estimation of tuning parameters remains elusive. In this paper, by using the
so-called empirical checkerboard copula we build a hierarchical empirical Bayes
model that enables the estimation of a smooth copula function for arbitrary
dimensions. The proposed estimator based on the multivariate Bernstein
polynomials is itself a genuine copula and the selection of its
dimension-varying degrees is data-dependent. We also show that the proposed
copula estimator provides a more accurate estimate of several multivariate
dependence measures which can be obtained in closed form. We investigate the
asymptotic and finite-sample performance of the proposed estimator and compare
it with some nonparametric estimators through simulation studies. An
application to portfolio risk management is presented along with a
quantification of estimation uncertainty.

Galactic plane has been known since the early 1980s. With a deep X-ray exposure
using the Chandra X-ray Observatory of a slightly off-plane region in the
Galactic bulge, most of the extended emission was resolved into faint discrete
X-ray sources in the Fe K band (Revnivtsev et al.,2009). The major constituents
of these sources have long been considered to be X-ray active stars and
magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, recent works including our NIR
imaging and spectroscopic studies (Morihana et al.,2013, 2016) argue that other
populations should be more dominant. To investigate this further, we conducted
a much deeper NIR imaging observation at the center of the Chandra's exposure
field. We have used the MOIRCS on the Subaru telescope, reaching the limiting
magnitude of ~18 mag in the J, H, and Ks bands in this crowded region, and
identified ~50 % of the X-ray sources with NIR candidate counterparts. We
classified the X-ray sources into three groups (A, B, and C) based on their
positions in the X-ray color-color diagram and characterized them based on the
X-ray and NIR features. We argue that the major populations of the Group A and
C sources are, respectively, CVs (binaries containing magnetic or non-magnetic
white dwarfs with high accretion rates) and X-ray active stars. The major
population of the Group B sources is presumably WD binaries with low mass
accretion rates. The Fe K equivalent width in the composite X-ray spectrum of
the Group B sources is the largest among the three and comparable to that of
the Galactic bulge X-ray emission. This leads us to speculate that there are
numerous WD binaries with low mass accretion rates, which are not recognized as
CVs, but are the major contributor of the apparently extended X-ray emission.

SV remediation and triage. Ranking of SV severity scores is often used to
advise prioritization of patching efforts. However, severity assessment is a
difficult and subjective manual task that relies on expertise, knowledge, and
standardized reporting schemes. Consequently, different data sources that
perform independent analysis may provide conflicting severity rankings.
Inconsistency across these data sources affects the reliability of severity
assessment data, and can consequently impact SV prioritization and fixing. In
this study, we investigate severity ranking inconsistencies over the SV
reporting lifecycle. Our analysis helps characterize the nature of this
problem, identify correlated factors, and determine the impacts of
inconsistency on downstream tasks. Our findings observe that SV severity often
lacks consideration or is underestimated during initial reporting, and such SVs
consequently receive lower prioritization. We identify six potential attributes
that are correlated to this misjudgment, and show that inconsistency in
severity reporting schemes can severely degrade the performance of downstream
severity prediction by up to 77%. Our findings help raise awareness of SV
severity data inconsistencies and draw attention to this data quality problem.
These insights can help developers better consider SV severity data sources,
and improve the reliability of consequent SV prioritization. Furthermore, we
encourage researchers to provide more attention to SV severity data selection.

the difficulty in unseen singer modeling, we propose Multi-Singer, a fast
multi-singer vocoder with generative adversarial networks. Specifically, 1)
Multi-Singer uses a multi-band generator to speed up both training and
inference procedure. 2) to capture and rebuild singer identity from the
acoustic feature (i.e., mel-spectrogram), Multi-Singer adopts a singer
conditional discriminator and conditional adversarial training objective. 3) to
supervise the reconstruction of singer identity in the spectrum envelopes in
frequency domain, we propose an auxiliary singer perceptual loss. The joint
training approach effectively works in GANs for multi-singer voices modeling.
Experimental results verify the effectiveness of OpenSinger and show that
Multi-Singer improves unseen singer singing voices modeling in both speed and
quality over previous methods. The further experiment proves that combined with
FastSpeech 2 as the acoustic model, Multi-Singer achieves strong robustness in

enzymatic velocity in the transient regime is non-hyperbolic for product
turnovers below a critical time, but asymptotically recovers the hyperbolic MME
at long times. Here, we use this description to introduce a new kinetic
measure, the turnover number dependent fractional enzyme velocity. This measure
quantifies the degree of non-hyperbolicity in the non-classical transient
regime with respect to the hyperbolic MME. From this, we obtain a generalized
rate parameter condition for detailed balance in mesoscopic MM kinetics. This
condition, while subsuming the fast equilibrium approximation of the classical
MM kinetics, provides a strict lower bound on the magnitude of the catalytic
rate parameter. Further, from the condition of stationarity of the generating
function solution of the CME, we quantify the duration of the non-classical
regime. Our results show that the violation of detailed balance condition in
the transient regime is inextricably linked to the non-hyperbolic substrate
dependence of the enzymatic velocity. In the steady-state, when an effective
equilibrium between enzyme and complex is asymptotically established, the
condition of detailed balance emerges as a sufficient condition for the
hyperbolic substrate dependence of the MME.

remains an urgent problem in this field. Usually in experiments this relies on
the detection for the topological edge modes, which may requires the high
demands for the preparation and purifications of the materials and may give
ambiguities. In this work, we propose a new approach towards the unambiguous
detection of the bulk band crossing nodes of topological nodal systems without
evolving the edge mode. The spirit of our proposal is to couple our targeted
Hamiltonian to an weak external field $\mathbf {A}$ with a spatial varying
texture in a compact manifold which may lead to the variation of the wavevector
$\mathbf {k}$, and the system will have a response current $\mathbf {J}$. When
the field $\mathbf {A}$ is close to the nodal point, the current $\mathbf {J}$
has the same texture as $\mathbf {A}$, indicating that we may turn the
measurement for the bulk topological band crossing nodes into the measurement
for the spatial texture of $\mathbf {J}$, and a Berry monopole indicator
indicator $w$ can be constructed to indicate the distance between the field
$\mathbf {A}$ and the band crossing node. Our findings provide an new
perspective for the detection of band topology and pave the way for the further
theoretical and experimental studies.

application programmers to navigate the computation among instances or nodes by
inserting hop(destination) statements in their app code, and choose when to

processing ability of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to achieve smooth and

this paper, we propose a simple feed-forward deep neural network for motion

dynamically during training. The entire model is suitable for all actions and
follows a framework of encoder-decoder. The encoder consists of temporal GCNs
to capture motion features between frames and semi-autonomous learned spatial
GCNs to extract spatial structure among joint trajectories. The decoder uses
temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to maintain its extensive ability.

paper, a novel segmentation scheme is proposed for the infections of COVID-19
by enhancing supervised information and fusing multi-scale feature maps of
different levels based on the encoder-decoder architecture. To this end, a deep
collaborative supervision (Co-supervision) scheme is proposed to guide the
network learning the features of edges and semantics. More specifically, an
Edge Supervised Module (ESM) is firstly designed to highlight low-level
boundary features by incorporating the edge supervised information into the
initial stage of down-sampling. Meanwhile, an Auxiliary Semantic Supervised
Module (ASSM) is proposed to strengthen high-level semantic information by
integrating mask supervised information into the later stage. Then an Attention
Fusion Module (AFM) is developed to fuse multiple scale feature maps of
different levels by using an attention mechanism to reduce the semantic gaps
between high-level and low-level feature maps. Finally, the effectiveness of
the proposed scheme is demonstrated on four various COVID-19 CT datasets. The
results show that the proposed three modules are all promising. Based on the
baseline (ResUnet), using ESM, ASSM, or AFM alone can respectively increase
Dice metric by 1.12\%, 1.95\%,1.63\% in our dataset, while the integration by
incorporating three models together can rise 3.97\%. Compared with the existing
approaches in various datasets, the proposed method can obtain better

generalization and comprehensive performance.

(BN) structure learning. Existing local-to-global learning algorithms first
construct the skeleton of a DAG (directed acyclic graph) by learning the MB

then orient edges in the skeleton. However, existing MB or PC learning methods
are often computationally expensive especially with a large-sized BN, resulting
in inefficient local-to-global learning algorithms. To tackle the problem, in
this paper, we develop an efficient local-to-global learning approach using
feature selection. Specifically, we first analyze the rationale of the
well-known Minimum-Redundancy and Maximum-Relevance (MRMR) feature selection
approach for learning a PC set of a variable. Based on the analysis, we propose
an efficient F2SL (feature selection-based structure learning) approach to
local-to-global BN structure learning. The F2SL approach first employs the MRMR
approach to learn a DAG skeleton, then orients edges in the skeleton. Employing
independence tests or score functions for orienting edges, we instantiate the
F2SL approach into two new algorithms, F2SL-c (using independence tests) and
F2SL-s (using score functions). Compared to the state-of-the-art
local-to-global BN learning algorithms, the experiments validated that the
proposed algorithms in this paper are more efficient and provide competitive

  from the conference version and new results obtained by Michelle Sweering",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The minimizers sampling mechanism is a popular mechanism for string sampling
introduced independently by Schleimer et al. [SIGMOD 2003] and by Roberts et
al. [Bioinf. 2004]. Given two positive integers $w$ and $k$, it selects the
lexicographically smallest length-$k$ substring in every fragment of $w$
consecutive length-$k$ substrings (in every sliding window of length $w + k -
1$). Minimizers samples are approximately uniform, locally consistent, and
computable in linear time. Two main disadvantages of minimizers sampling
mechanisms are: first, they do not have good guarantees on the expected size of
their samples for every combination of $w$ and $k$; and, second, indexes that
are constructed over their samples do not have good worst-case guarantees for
on-line pattern searches.
  We introduce bidirectional string anchors (bd-anchors), a new string sampling
mechanism. Given a positive integer $\ell$, our mechanism selects the
lexicographically smallest rotation in every length-$\ell$ fragment (in every
sliding window of length $\ell$). We show that bd-anchors samples are also
approximately uniform, locally consistent, and computable in linear time. In
addition, our experiments using several datasets demonstrate that the
bd-anchors sample sizes decrease proportionally to $\ell$; and that these sizes
are competitive to or smaller than the minimizers sample sizes using the
analogous sampling parameters. We provide theoretical justification for these
results by analyzing the expected size of bd-anchors samples. As a negative
result, we show that computing a total order $\leq$ on the input alphabet,
which minimizes the bd-anchors sample size, is NP-hard. We also show that by
using any bd-anchors sample, we can construct, in near-linear time, an index

  Communications (INFOCOM) 2022",,,,"cs.LG eess.SP math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning to optimize (L2O) has recently emerged as a promising approach to
solving optimization problems by exploiting the strong prediction power of
neural networks and offering lower runtime complexity than conventional
solvers. While L2O has been applied to various problems, a crucial yet
challenging class of problems -- robust combinatorial optimization in the form
of minimax optimization -- have largely remained under-explored. In addition to
the exponentially large decision space, a key challenge for robust
combinatorial optimization lies in the inner optimization problem, which is
typically non-convex and entangled with outer optimization. In this paper, we
study robust combinatorial optimization and propose a novel learning-based
optimizer, called LRCO (Learning for Robust Combinatorial Optimization), which
quickly outputs a robust solution in the presence of uncertain context. LRCO
leverages a pair of learning-based optimizers -- one for the minimizer and the
other for the maximizer -- that use their respective objective functions as
losses and can be trained without the need of labels for training problem
instances. To evaluate the performance of LRCO, we perform simulations for the
task offloading problem in vehicular edge computing. Our results highlight that
LRCO can greatly reduce the worst-case cost and improve robustness, while
having a very low runtime complexity.

metasurfaces and find two critical phenomena. The first is the Casimir-induced
instability of a deformable metallic film. In general, two charge-neutral
interfaces attract with or repel each other due to the contribution from the
zero-point fluctuation of the electromagnetic field between them, namely, the
Casimir effect. The effects of perturbative interface corrugation on the
Casimir energy in the film system is studied by the proximity force
approximation with dispersion correction. If the corrugation period exceeds a
critical value, the Casimir effect dominates the surface tension and brings
about structural instability. The second is \v{C}erenkov radiation in the
vacuum from a time-varying, corrugated surface. Travelling faster than light
brings about electromagnetic shock waves, \v{C}erenkov radiation. Since light
is the fastest object in a vacuum, it has been considered that \v{C}erenkov
radiation is emitted only in the presence of some refractive index. Here, I
propose mimicking a series of particles travelling faster than light in a
vacuum by dynamical surface corrugation to find \v{C}erenkov radiation in a
vacuum from the surface. The dynamical corrugation induces an effective current
source on the surface with an external electrostatic field applied. When the
corrugation profile is of travelling wave type, the source can be regarded as a
series of dipoles virtually travelling along the surface. If the phase velocity
of the travelling wave profile exceeds the speed of light, and so do the
dipoles, they emit \v{C}erenkov radiation in a vacuum.

to realize safe and trustworthy driving automation. Previous studies on vehicle
trajectory prediction mainly fall into two categories, i.e. physics-based and

a lane departure prediction algorithm based on closed-loop vehicle dynamics
model. We use extended Kalman filter to estimate the current vehicle states
based on sensing module outputs. Then a Kalman Predictor with actual lane
keeping control law is used to predict steering actions and vehicle states in
the future. A lane departure assessment module evaluates the probabilistic
distribution of vehicle corner positions and decides whether to initiate a
human takeover request. The prediction algorithm is capable to describe the
stochastic characteristics of future vehicle pose, which is preliminarily
proved in simulated tests. Finally, the on-road tests at speeds of 15 to 50

method is commonly used to train this type of learning models, while the
convergence rate is retarded by the variance of stochastic gradients. In this

basic idea is to introduce an estimator in each node, which tracks the local

the bounds of error sequences, we prove that DPSVRG converges at the rate of

is obtained from the static mean-field approximation. The situation drastically
changes at non-zero temperatures. No reliable solutions apart from numerical
simulations exist there. We show that any static mean-field approximation fails
at non-zero temperatures since magnetic fluctuations induce dynamical
corrections that lead to broadening of the in-gap state energies to energy
bands. Spin-symmetric equilibrium state at non-zero temperatures is unstable
with respect to magnetic fluctuations and the zero magnetic field can be
reached only as a weak limit of the spin-polarized solution like in a
magnetically ordered phase.

reconstructing the Maxwell's equal-area law, we find there exists the

large/small one. The Gibbs free energy landscape ($G_L$) is treated as a
function of the black hole horizon, which is the order parameter of the phase

stable HPBH/LPBL states are corresponding to two wells of $G_L$, which have the
same depth. The unstable intermediate-potential black hole state corresponds to
the local maximum of $G_L$. Then we focus on the probability evolution governed
by the Fokker-Planck equation. Through solving the Fokker-Planck equating with
different reflection/aborption boundary conditions and initial conditions, the
dynamics of switching between the coexistent HPBH and LPBL phases is probed
within the first passage time. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on the
dynamic property of phase transition is also investigated.

study flow dynamics over a network. In this model we have a single source-sink
pair and each link has a per-time-unit capacity and a transit time. A dynamic
equilibrium (or equilibrium flow over time) is a flow pattern over time such
that no flow particle has incentives to unilaterally change its path. Although
the model has been around for almost fifty years, only recently results
regarding existence and characterization of equilibria have been obtained. In
particular the long term behavior remains poorly understood. Our main result in
this paper is to show that, under a natural (and obviously necessary) condition
on the queuing capacity, a dynamic equilibrium reaches a steady state (after
which queue lengths remain constant) in finite time. Previously, it was not
even known that queue lengths would remain bounded. The proof is based on the
analysis of a rather non-obvious potential function that turns out to be
monotone along the evolution of the equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that the
steady state is characterized as an optimal solution of a certain linear
program. When this program has a unique solution, which occurs generically, the
long term behavior is completely predictable. On the contrary, if the linear
program has multiple solutions the steady state is more difficult to identify
as it depends on the whole temporal evolution of the equilibrium.

mid-sized quantum devices remains an important challenge in quantum computing.
We develop a tomography approach that requires moderate computational and
quantum resources for the tomography of states that can be approximated by
Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. The proposed method, Hamiltonian Learning
Tomography, uses a Hamiltonian learning algorithm to get a parametrized ansatz
for the Gibbs Hamiltonian, and optimizes it with respect to the results of
local measurements. We demonstrate the utility of this method with a high
fidelity reconstruction of the density matrix of 4 to 10 qubits in a Gibbs
state of the transverse-field Ising model, in numerical simulations as well as
in experiments on IBM Quantum superconducting devices accessed via the cloud.
Code implementation of the our method is freely available as an open source
software in Python.

ingredients of trustworthy and reliable text classification. However, previous
works usually address one of two aspects: i) how to extract accurate rationales

predictive model robust to different types of adversarial attacks. Intuitively,
a model that produces helpful explanations should be more robust against
adversarial attacks, because we cannot trust the model that outputs
explanations but changes its prediction under small perturbations. To this end,
we propose a joint classification and rationale extraction model named AT-BMC.
It includes two key mechanisms: mixed Adversarial Training (AT) is designed to
use various perturbations in discrete and embedding space to improve the
model's robustness, and Boundary Match Constraint (BMC) helps to locate
rationales more precisely with the guidance of boundary information.
Performances on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed AT-BMC
outperforms baselines on both classification and rationale extraction by a
large margin. Robustness analysis shows that the proposed AT-BMC decreases the
attack success rate effectively by up to 69%. The empirical results indicate
that there are connections between robust models and better explanations.

a drastic weakening of the transition when going from $N_{\tau}=4$ to
$N_{\tau}=2$, which is consistent with a second-order chiral transition

of supermassive black holes, as evidenced by empirical scaling relations in
nearby galaxies. Understanding this co-evolution over cosmic time requires the
revelation of the dynamical state of galaxies and the measurement of the mass
of their central black holes (MBH) at a range of cosmic distances. Bright
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are ideal for this purpose.
  Aims. The High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared
Integral field spectrograph (HARMONI), the first light integral-field
spectrograph for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will transform visible
and near-infrared ground-based astrophysics thanks to its advances in
sensitivity and angular resolution. We aim to analyse the capabilities of
HARMONI to reveal the stellar morpho-kinematic properties of the host galaxies
of AGNs at about cosmic noon.
  Methods. We made use of the simulation pipeline for HARMONI (HSIM) to create
mock observations of representative AGN host galaxies at redshifts around
cosmic noon. We used observations taken with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer (MUSE) of nearby galaxies showing different morphologies and dynamical
stages combined with theoretical AGN spectra to create the target inputs for
HSIM.
  Results. According to our simulations, an on-source integration time of three
hours should be enough to measure the MBH and to trace the morphology and
stellar kinematics of the brightest host galaxies of AGNs beyond cosmic noon.
For host galaxies with stellar masses $<$10$^{11}$ solar masses, longer
exposure times are mandatory to spatially resolve the stellar kinematics.

tasks, and generating synthetic networks that replicate the reciprocity values
observed in real networks. We also highlight these findings on two real

the learning path we designed, influenced by cryptography core ideas rather
than technical knowledge. We will detail how we used Snap! (a visual
programming language) to realize hands-on activities: programming playgrounds
to experiment with cryptosystems and their limits, and interactive support for
an unplugged activity on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The second goal is to
evaluate our intervention in terms of both student perceptions and learning of
core cryptography ideas. The students appreciated the course and felt that,
despite being remote, it was fun, interesting, and engaging. They said the
course helped them understand the role of cryptography, CS, and Math in society
and sparked their interest, especially in cryptography and CS. The third goal
is to discuss what worked well and areas of improvement. Pedagogically, remote
teaching caused high ""instructor blindness"" and prevented us from giving the
optimal amount of guidance during the exploration activities with Snap!
playgrounds, making them sometimes too challenging for total programming
novices. On the other hand, the ""remote-unplugged"" Diffie-Hellman worked well:
it embodies a coherent metaphor that engaged the students and made them grasp
this groundbreaking protocol. The students praised the activities as engaging,
even when challenging. The final assessment showed that the core cryptography
ideas were well understood.

relativity introduces new degrees of freedom contained in the torsion field
which encodes the torsion feature of spacetime. Interestingly, the torsion
field couples to all fermions through its axial-vector mode with a universal
coupling $\eta=1/8$ which is possible to change under the quantum effects. We
argue that Einstein-Cartan gravity provides a significant portal to probe $A'$
dark gauge boson which resides in dark sector existing as an invisible world
parallel to our own and couples to the standard model (SM) particles through
only the kinetic mixing. For the (very) small kinetic mixing, searches for the
$A'$ from Drell-Yan processes are insensitive due to the suppressed production
cross-section and the considerable SM backgrounds. However, through the
mediation of torsion field the $pp$ collisions produce dark-sector fermions
which would significantly produce the $A'$ due to unsuppressed dark gauge
coupling. We explore the potential production modes of the $A'$ through
bremsstrahlung off dark-sector fermion and the cascade decays. Einstein-Cartan
gravity suggests the torsion mass $\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(4)$ TeV for $\eta$
varying around the classical value since the present scenarios would tend to
produce the $A'$ with the high boost and large missing transverse momentum from
dark-sector fermions where the SM backgrounds are low. On the other hand, the
$A'$ search via Einstein-Cartan portal can reach even for the signal events to
be not large and is also sensitive to the (very) small kinetic mixing as long
as the decay channels of the $A'$ to dark-sector particles are inaccessible.

PoW consensus on how the existence of multiple misbehaving miners influences
the profitability of selfish mining. Each selfish miner (or attacker
interchangeably) maintains a private chain and makes it public
opportunistically for acquiring more rewards incommensurate to his Hash power.
We first establish a general Markov chain model to characterize the state
transition of public and private chains for Basic Selfish Mining (BSM), and
derive the stationary profitable threshold of Hash power in closed-form. It
reduces from 25% for a single attacker to below 21.48% for two symmetric
attackers theoretically, and further reduces to around 10% with eight symmetric
attackers experimentally. We next explore the profitable threshold when one of
the attackers performs strategic mining based on Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP) that only half of the attributes pertinent to a mining
state are observable to him. An online algorithm is presented to compute the
nearly optimal policy efficiently despite the large state space and high
dimensional belief space. The strategic attacker mines selfishly and more
agilely than BSM attacker when his Hash power is relatively high, and mines
honestly otherwise, thus leading to a much lower profitable threshold. Last, we
formulate a simple model of absolute mining revenue that yields an interesting
observation: selfish mining is never profitable at the first difficulty
adjustment period, but replying on the reimbursement of stationary selfish
mining gains in the future periods. The delay till being profitable of an
attacker increases with the decrease of his Hash power, making blockchain
miners more cautious on performing selfish mining.

synthesis of an optical instrument on-board a stratospheric balloon-borne
platform, such as a telescope or siderostat, to meet pointing requirements that
are becoming more and more stringent in the context of astronomy missions. Most
often in the literature, a simple control structure is chosen, and the control
gains are tuned empirically based on ground testings. However, due to the large
dimensions of the balloon and the flight chain, experimental set-ups only
involve the pointing system and the platform, whereas flight experience shows
that the pointing performance is essentially limited by the rejection of the
natural pendulum-like oscillations of the fully deployed system. This
observation justifies the need for a model that predicts such flight conditions
that cannot be replicated in laboratory, and for an adequate methodology
addressing the line-of-sight controller design. In particular, it is necessary
to ensure robust stability and performance to the parametric uncertainties

release of ballast throughout the flight, especially since experimental
validation is limited. In this paper, a dynamical model of the complete system
is proposed, based on a multibody approach and accounting for parametric
uncertainties with Linear Fractional Transformations. The comparison with
flight data shows that the frequency content of the platform's motion is
accurately predicted. Then, the robust control of the line-of-sight is tackled

scheduling preventive maintenance. The maintenance scheduling provides some
safety constraints which should be satisfied at all times. Satisfying the
critical safety and reliability constraints while the generation units have an
incomplete information of each others' bidding strategy is a challenging
problem. Bi-level optimization and reinforcement learning are state of the art
approaches for solving this type of problems. However, neither bi-level
optimization nor reinforcement learning can handle the challenges of incomplete

propose the safe deep deterministic policy gradient reinforcement learning

Various types of affinity mediators and enzymes have been attributed to
regulate spatial organization of chromatin from a thermodynamics perspective.
However, at the mechanistic level, enzymes act in their unique ways. Here, we
construct a polymer physics model following the mechanistic scheme of
Topoisomerase-II, an enzyme resolving topological constraints of chromatin, and
investigate its role on interphase chromatin organization. Our computer
simulations demonstrate Topoisomerase-II's ability to phase separate chromatin
into eu- and heterochromatic regions with a characteristic wall-like
organization of the euchromatic regions. Exploiting a mean-field framework, we
argue that the ability of the euchromatic regions crossing each other due to
enzymatic activity of Topoisomerase-II induces this phase separation. Motivated
from a recent experimental observation on different structural states of the
eu- and the heterochromatic units, we further extend our model to a bidisperse
setting and show that the characteristic features of the enzymatic activity
driven phase separation survives there. The existence of these characteristic
features, even under the non-localized action of the enzyme, highlights the
critical role of enzymatic activity in chromatin organization, and points out
the importance of further experiments along this line.

This limitation of the state of the art is a severe threat to validity in a

intermediate representation. We performed empirical investigations to highlight
how, without the unified model, a significant amount of Java methods called
from the native code are ""unreachable"" in apps' call-graphs, both in goodware

cases where malware relied on native code to hide invocation of payment library

JuCify's model enables state-of-the-art tools to achieve better precision and

the Analogue Gravity context, this transition corresponds to a white-hole

Existing BN variant methods aggregate source and target domain knowledge in the

features of corresponding channels across domains often leads to a sub-optimal
transferability. In this paper, we exploit the cross-domain relation and
propose a novel normalization method, Reciprocal Normalization (RN).
Specifically, RN first presents a Reciprocal Compensation (RC) module to
acquire the compensatory for each channel in both domains based on the
cross-domain channel-wise correlation. Then RN develops a Reciprocal
Aggregation (RA) module to adaptively aggregate the feature with its
cross-domain compensatory components. As an alternative to BN, RN is more
suitable for UDA problems and can be easily integrated into popular domain
adaptation methods. Experiments show that the proposed RN outperforms existing

detection. We find that a confined 2DES supporting plasmon resonance has an
upper limit of absorption cross-section, which is identical to that of simple
metallic dipole antenna. Small size of plasmonic resonators implies their weak
dipole moments and impeded coupling to free-space radiation. Achieving the
'dipole limit' of absorption cross-section in isolated 2DES is possible either
at unrealistically long carrier momentum relaxation times, or at resonant
frequencies below units of terahertz. We further show that amendment of even
small metal contacts to 2DES promotes the coupling and reduces the fundamental
mode frequency. The contacted resonators can still have deep-subwavelength
size. They can be merged into compact arrays of detectors, where signals from
elements tuned to different frequencies are summed up. Such arrays may find

$\{\mathcal{T}|\boldsymbol{t}_0\}$, namely, the time reversal operation
followed by a half lattice translation, which significantly alters the symmetry
conditions for stabilizing the band degeneracies. In this work, based on
symmetry analysis and modeling, we present a complete classification of
emergent particles in type-IV MSGs by studying all possible (spinless and
spinful, essential and accidental) particles in each of the 517 type-IV MSGs.
Particularly, the detailed correspondence between the emergent particles and
the type-IV MSGs that can host them are given in easily accessed interactive
tables, where the basic information of the emergent particles, including the
symmetry conditions, the effective Hamiltonian, the band dispersion and the
topological characters can be found. According to the established encyclopedia,
we find that several emergent particles that are previously believed to exist
only in spinless systems will occur in spinful systems here, and vice versa,
due to the $\{{\cal T}|\boldsymbol{t}_{0}\}$ symmetry. Our work not only
deepens the understanding of the symmetry conditions for realizing emergent
particles but also provides specific guidance for searching and designing

non-Hermitian system. The exceptional point (EP) in a non-Hermitian system
admits a peculiar dynamics: the final state being a particular eigenstate,
coalescing state. In this work, we study the dynamic transition from a trivial
insulating state to an {\eta}-pairing state in a composite non-Hermitian
Hubbard system. The system consists of two subsystems, A and B, which are
connected by unidirectional hoppings.We show that the dynamic transition from
an insulating state to an {\eta}-pairing state occurs by the probability flow
from A to B: the initial state is prepared as an insulating state of A, while B
is left empty. The final state is an {\eta}-pairing state in B but empty in A.
Analytical analyses and numerical simulations show that the speed of relaxation
of the off-diagonal long-range order pair state depends on the order of the EP,

algorithms learn robust policies by modeling the disturbance and applying it to
source environments during training, which usually requires prior knowledge
about the disturbance and control of simulators. However, these algorithms can
fail in scenarios where the disturbance from target environments is unknown or
is intractable to model in simulators. To tackle this problem, we propose a
novel model-free actor-critic algorithm -- namely, state-conservative policy
optimization (SCPO) -- to learn robust policies without modeling the
disturbance in advance. Specifically, SCPO reduces the disturbance in
transition dynamics to that in state space and then approximates it by a simple
gradient-based regularizer. The appealing features of SCPO include that it is
simple to implement and does not require additional knowledge about the
disturbance or specially designed simulators. Experiments in several robot

(CCFT and GCFT) in $d>2$ dimensions. We construct the highest weight
representations (HWR) of Carrollian and Galilean conformal algebra (CCA and
GCA). Even though the two algebras have different structures, their HWRs share
similar structure, because their rotation subalgebras are isomorphic. In both
cases, we find that the finite dimensional representations are generally
reducible but indecomposable, and can be organized into the multiplets.
Moreover, it turns out that the multiplet representations in $d>2$ CCA and GCA
carry not only the simple chain structure appeared in logCFT or $2d$ GCFT, but
also more generally the net structures. We manage to classify all the allowed
chain representations. Furthermore we discuss the two-point and three-point
correlators by using the Ward identities. We mainly focus on the two-point
correlators of the operators in chain representations. Even in this relative
simple case, we find some novel features: multiple-level structure, shortage of
the selection rule on the representations, undetermined 2-pt coefficients,
etc.. We find that the non-trivial correlators could only appear for the
representations of certain structure, and the correlators are generally
polynomials of time coordinates for CCFT (spacial coordinates for GCFT), whose
orders depend on the levels of the correlators.

for short) equations. The constructed weak solutions do not conserve the
magnetic helicity and can be close to any given smooth, divergence-free and
mean-free velocity and magnetic fields. Furthermore, we prove that the weak
solutions constructed by Beekie-Buckmaster-Vicol [2] for the ideal MHD can be
obtained as a strong vanishing viscosity and resistivity limit of a sequence of
weak solutions to MHD equations. This shows that, in contrast to the weak ideal
limits, Taylor's conjecture does not hold along the vanishing viscosity and
resistivity limits. Unlike in the context of the NSE [13] and the ideal MHD
[2], new types of velocity and magnetic flows, featuring both the refined
spatial and temporal intermittency, are constructed to respect the geometry of
MHD and to control the strong viscosity and resistivity. Compatible algebraic
structure is derived in the convex integration scheme. More interestingly, the
new intermittent flows indeed enable us to prove the aforementioned results for
the hyper-viscous and hyper-resistive MHD equations up to the sharp exponent
$5/4$, which coincides exactly with the Lions exponent for 3D hyper-viscous
NSE.

are in person or online. Variable rates of interaction in structured
populations can be described by networks with the time-varying activity of
links and nodes. One of the key statistics to summarize temporal patterns is
the inter-event time (IET), namely the duration between successive pairwise
interactions. Empirical studies have found IET distributions that are
heavy-tailed (or ""bursty""), for temporally varying interaction, both physical
and digital. But it is difficult to construct theoretical models of
time-varying activity on a network that reproduces the burstiness seen in
empirical data. Here we develop a spanning-tree method to construct temporal
networks and activity patterns with bursty behavior. Our method ensures a
desired target IET distribution of single nodes/links, provided the
distribution fulfills a consistency condition, regardless of whether the
underlying topology is static or time-varying. We show that this model can
reproduce burstiness found in empirical datasets, and so it may serve as a
basis for studying dynamic processes in real-world bursty interactions.

Operational between 2007 and 2012, this mission discovered 37 transiting
planets, including CoRoT-7b, the first terrestrial exoplanet with a measured
size. The precision of the published transit ephemeris of most of these planets
has been limited by the relative short durations of the CoRoT pointings, which
implied a danger that the transits will become unobservable within a few years
due to the uncertainty of their future transit epochs. Ground-based follow-up
observations of the majority of the CoRoT planets have been published in recent
years. Between Dec. 2018 and Jan. 2021, the TESS mission in its sectors 6 and
33 re-observed those CoRoT fields that pointed towards the Galactic
anti-center. These data permitted the identification of transits from nine of
the CoRoT planets, and the derivation of precise new transit epochs. The main
motivation of this study has been to derive precise new ephemerides of the
CoRoT planets, in order to keep these planets' transits observable for future
generations of telescopes. The TESS data were analyzed for the presence of
transits and the epochs of these re-observed transits were measured. The
original CoRoT epochs, epochs from ground-based follow-up observations and
those from TESS were collected. From these data updated ephemerides are
presented for nine transiting planets discovered by the CoRoT mission in its
fields pointing towards the Galactic anti-center. In three cases (CoRoT-4b, 19b
and 20b), transits that would have been lost for ground observations, due to
the large uncertainty in the previous ephemeris, have been recovered. The
updated ephemerides permit transit predictions with uncertainties of less than
30 min for observations at least until the year 2030. No significant transit
timing variations were found in these systems.

hence must have outcompeted the two-letter alphabet genomes. Using a model that
we previously used to demonstrate the evolutionary advantages of unidirectional

(single instruction - multiple data) operations using the phenomenon of
superposition. Since the dimension of the state space grows exponentially with
the number of qubits, we can easily reach situations where we pay less than a
single quantum gate per data point for data-processing instructions which would
be rather expensive in classical computing. Formulating such instructions in
terms of quantum gates, however, still remains a challenging task. Laying out
the foundational functions for more advanced data-processing is therefore a
subject of paramount importance for advancing the realm of quantum computing.
In this paper, we introduce the formalism of encoding so called-semi-boolean
polynomials. As it turns out, arithmetic $\mathbb{Z}/2^n\mathbb{Z}$ ring
operations can be formulated as semi-boolean polynomial evaluations, which
allows convenient generation of unsigned integer arithmetic quantum circuits.
For arithmetic evaluations, the resulting algorithm has been known as
Fourier-arithmetic. We extend this type of algorithm with additional features,
such as ancilla-free in-place multiplication and integer coefficient polynomial
evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a tailor-made method for encoding signed
integers succeeded by an encoding for arbitrary floating-point numbers. This
representation of floating-point numbers and their processing can be applied to
any quantum algorithm that performs unsigned modular integer arithmetic. We
discuss some further performance enhancements of the semi boolean polynomial
encoder and finally supply a complexity estimation. The application of our
methods to a 32-bit unsigned integer multiplication demonstrated a 90\% circuit
depth reduction compared to carry-ripple approaches.

strides as a novel and effective representation, especially in the

reconstruction model based on INR which represents HSI by a continuous function
mapping a spatial coordinate to its corresponding spectral radiance values. In
particular, as a specific implementation of INR, the parameters of parametric
model are predicted by a hypernetwork that operates on feature extraction using
convolution network. It makes the continuous functions map the spatial
coordinates to pixel values in a content-aware manner. Moreover, periodic
spatial encoding are deeply integrated with the reconstruction procedure, which
makes our model capable of recovering more high frequency details. To verify
the efficacy of our model, we conduct experiments on three HSI datasets (CAVE,

achieve competitive reconstruction performance in comparison with the

technique in alcohol studies. Design: To estimate the determinants of problem
drinking using a Heckman and a two-part estimation model. Psychological and
neuro-scientific studies justify my underlying estimation assumptions and
covariate exclusion restrictions. Higher order tests checking for
multicollinearity validate the use of Heckman over the use of two-part
estimation models. I discuss the generalizability of the two models in applied
research. Settings and Participants: Two pooled national population surveys
from 2016 and 2017 were used: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey
(BRFS), and the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Measurements:
Participation in problem drinking and meeting the criteria for problem
drinking. Findings: Both U.S. national surveys perform well with the Heckman
model and pass all higher order tests. The Heckman model corrects for selection
bias and reveals the direction of bias, where the two-part model does not. For
example, the coefficients on age are upward biased and unemployment is downward
biased in the two-part where the Heckman model does not have a selection bias.
Covariate exclusion restrictions are sensitive to survey conditions and are
contextually generalizable. Conclusions: The Heckman model can be used for
alcohol (smoking studies as well) if the underlying estimation specification
passes higher order tests for multicollinearity and the exclusion restrictions
are justified with integrity for the data used. Its use is merit-worthy because
it corrects for and reveals the direction and the magnitude of selection bias
where the two-part does not.

approximation spaces for solving high-frequency heterogeneous Helmholtz
problems is systematically studied. The local spaces are built from selected
eigenvectors of carefully designed local eigenvalue problems defined on
generalized harmonic spaces. At both continuous and discrete levels, $(i)$
wavenumber explicit and nearly exponential decay rates for local and global
approximation errors are obtained without any assumption on the size of
subdomains; $(ii)$ a quasi-optimal convergence of the method is established by
assuming that the size of subdomains is $O(1/k)$ ($k$ is the wavenumber). A
novel resonance effect between the wavenumber and the dimension of local spaces

analysis. Furthermore, for fixed dimensions of local spaces, the discrete local
errors are proved to converge as $h\rightarrow 0$ ($h$ denoting the mesh size)

the plane wave partition of unity method [I. Babuska and J. M. Melenk,

covariate balance tables with not only covariate means by treatment group but
also the associated $p$-values from significance tests of their differences.
The practical need to avoid small $p$-values renders balance check and
rerandomization by hypothesis testing standards an attractive tool for
improving covariate balance in randomized experiments. Despite the
intuitiveness of such practice and its arguably already widespread use in
reality, the existing literature knows little about its implications on
subsequent inference, subjecting many effectively rerandomized experiments to
possibly inefficient analyses. To fill this gap, we examine a variety of
potentially useful schemes for rerandomization based on $p$-values (ReP) from
covariate balance tests, and demonstrate their impact on subsequent inference.
Specifically, we focus on three estimators of the average treatment effect from
the unadjusted, additive, and fully interacted linear regressions of the
outcome on treatment, respectively, and derive their respective asymptotic
sampling properties under ReP. The main findings are twofold. First, the
estimator from the fully interacted regression is asymptotically the most
efficient under all ReP schemes examined, and permits convenient
regression-assisted inference identical to that under complete randomization.
Second, ReP improves not only covariate balance but also the efficiency of the
estimators from the unadjusted and additive regressions asymptotically. The
standard regression analysis, in consequence, is still valid but can be overly
conservative.

Bayesian reasoning can solve these concerns, but it is computationally
expensive and, unlike neural networks, does not translate naturally to
memristor-based architectures. In this work, we introduce, demonstrate
experimentally on a fully fabricated hybrid CMOS-memristor system, and analyze
a Bayesian machine designed for highly-energy efficient Bayesian reasoning. The
architecture of the machine is obtained by writing Bayes' law in a way making
its implementation natural by the principles of distributed memory and
stochastic computing, allowing the circuit to function using solely local
memory and minimal data movement. Measurements on a fabricated small-scale
Bayesian machine featuring 2,048 memristors and 30,080 transistors show the
viability of this approach and the possibility of overcoming the challenges
associated with its design: the inherent imperfections of memristors, as well
as the need to distribute very locally higher-than-nominal supply voltages. The
design of a scaled-up version of the machine shows its outstanding energy
efficiency on a real-life gesture recognition task: a gesture can be recognized
using 5,000 times less energy than using a microcontroller unit. The Bayesian
machine also features several desirable features, e.g., instant on/off
operation, compatibility with low supply voltages, and resilience to
single-event upsets. These results open the road for Bayesian reasoning as an
attractive way for energy-efficient, robust, and explainable intelligence at

Hamiltonian chaos in a system with balanced loss and gain. Further, we modify
the nonlinear terms of the model to make it a non-Hamiltonian system of coupled

other known data on charmless two body decays of anti-triplet charmed baryons,
a lot of information can be derived with the assistance of $SU(3)$ flavour

some predictions based on the new measurements which can be tested with the
high luminosity experiments in the future. More interestingly, we find that a
global fit is now possible with the addition of new Belle data. In general,
there are 18 complex $SU(3)$ invariant amplitudes. We find that a scenario of
all amplitudes being real can fit the data well with a $\chi^2/d.o.f$ only
$0.773$. This indicates that neglecting the phases of the amplitudes is a
reasonable assumption. When more data become available, one may be able to get
more information for phases in the amplitudes.
  We give several comments on the feature of global fit regarding the branching
fractions, relations between different decays, and decays involving $K^0$ and
$\bar K^0$. Many of the unknown branching fractions and polarization asymmetry
parameters of anti-triplet charmed baryon for charmless two body decays are

justify simple comparisons across treatment groups. Regression adjustment
provides a convenient way to incorporate covariate information for additional
efficiency. This article provides a unified account of its utility for
improving estimation efficiency in multi-armed experiments. We start with the
commonly used additive and fully interacted models for regression adjustment,
and clarify the trade-offs between the resulting ordinary least-squares (OLS)
estimators for estimating average treatment effects in terms of finite-sample
performance and asymptotic efficiency. We then move on to regression adjustment
based on restricted least squares (RLS), and establish for the first time its
properties for inferring average treatment effects from the design-based
perspective. The resulting inference has multiple guarantees. First, it is
asymptotically efficient when the restriction is correctly specified. Second,
it remains consistent as long as the restriction on the coefficients of the
treatment indicators, if any, is correctly specified and separate from that on
the coefficients of the treatment-covariates interactions. Third, it can have
better finite-sample performance than its unrestricted counterpart even if the
restriction is moderately misspecified. It is thus our recommendation for
covariate adjustment in multi-armed experiments when the OLS fit of the fully
interacted regression risks large finite-sample variability in case of many
covariates, many treatments, yet a moderate sample size. In addition, the
proposed theory of RLS also provides a powerful tool for studying OLS-based
inference from general regression specifications. As an illustration, we
demonstrate its unique value for studying OLS-based regression adjustment in
factorial experiments via both theory and simulation.

neural network (GNN) models to changes in evolving graphs. We address two
critical challenges of lifelong graph learning in this work: dealing with new
classes and tackling imbalanced class distributions. The combination of these
two challenges is particularly relevant since newly emerging classes typically
resemble only a tiny fraction of the data, adding to the already skewed class
distribution. We make several contributions: First, we show that the amount of
unlabeled data does not influence the results, which is an essential
prerequisite for lifelong learning on a sequence of tasks. Second, we
experiment with different label rates and show that our methods can perform
well with only a tiny fraction of annotated nodes. Third, we propose the gDOC
method to detect new classes under the constraint of having an imbalanced class
distribution. The critical ingredient is a weighted binary cross-entropy loss
function to account for the class imbalance. Moreover, we demonstrate
combinations of gDOC with various base GNN models such as GraphSAGE, Simplified
Graph Convolution, and Graph Attention Networks. Lastly, our k-neighborhood
time difference measure provably normalizes the temporal changes across
different graph datasets. With extensive experimentation, we find that the
proposed gDOC method is consistently better than a naive adaption of DOC to
graphs. Specifically, in experiments using the smallest history size, the
out-of-distribution detection score of gDOC is 0.09 compared to 0.01 for DOC.
Furthermore, gDOC achieves an Open-F1 score, a combined measure of
in-distribution classification and out-of-distribution detection, of 0.33
compared to 0.25 of DOC (32% increase).

has significant biological implications, because it exhibits a class of

Moreover, we provide a handy representation of the fixation probability.
Siegmund duality plays a key role in our proofs. The dual process can be

algorithmically-useful characterization of graph classes with bounded
expansion. In this work, we consider the hardness and approximability of these
parameters. First, we complete the work of Grohe et al. (WG 2015) by showing
that computing the weak 2-coloring number is NP-hard. Our approach further
establishes that determining if a graph has weak $r$-coloring number at most
$k$ is para-NP-hard when parameterized by $k$ for all $r \geq 2$. We adapt this
to determining if a graph has $r$-coloring number at most $k$ as well, proving
para-NP-hardness for all $r \geq 2$. Para-NP-hardness implies that no XP
algorithm (runtime $O(n^{f(k)})$) exists for testing if a generalized coloring
number is at most $k$. Moreover, there exists a constant $c$ such that it is
NP-hard to approximate the generalized coloring numbers within a factor of $c$.
To complement these results, we give an approximation algorithm for the
generalized coloring numbers, improving both the runtime and approximation
factor of the existing approach of Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k (EuJC 2013). We prove that
greedily ordering vertices with small estimated backconnectivity achieves a

conventional stage of inflationary evolution the spectral energy density is
blue at intermediate frequencies above the fHz and then flattens out after a
knee that is typically smaller than the mHz. We investigate here the conditions
leading to a sufficiently large spectral energy density in the nHz range where
some peculiar signatures observed with the pulsar timing arrays have been
recently attributed to cosmic gravitons. If these potential evidences are
combined with the most recent bounds provided by wide-band interferometers in
the audio range (i.e. between few Hz and the kHz) the allowed regions of the
parameter space are compatible with both determinations and also with all the
other constraints associated with the background of relic gravitons produced
during inflation. The present analysis suggests that the pulsar timing arrays
are sensitive to the evolution of the refractive index during the early stages
of the inflationary evolution. This physical interpretation of the preliminary
empirical evidence is distinguishable from other perspectives since the
high-frequency normalization, the blue spectral index and the tensor to scalar
ratio cannot be independently assigned but are all related to the frequency of
the knee that is ultimately determined by the competition between the rate of
evolution of the refractive index and the slow-roll corrections.

de-bias learning frameworks try to capture specific dataset bias by annotations
but they fail to handle complicated OOD scenarios. Others implicitly identify
the dataset bias by special design low capability biased models or losses, but
they degrade when the training and testing data are from the same distribution.
In this paper, we propose a General Greedy De-bias learning framework (GGD),
which greedily trains the biased models and the base model. The base model is
encouraged to focus on examples that are hard to solve with biased models, thus
remaining robust against spurious correlations in the test stage. GGD largely
improves models' OOD generalization ability on various tasks, but sometimes
over-estimates the bias level and degrades on the in-distribution test. We
further re-analyze the ensemble process of GGD and introduce the Curriculum
Regularization inspired by curriculum learning, which achieves a good trade-off
between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance. Extensive
experiments on image classification, adversarial question answering, and visual
question answering demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. GGD can learn a
more robust base model under the settings of both task-specific biased models
with prior knowledge and self-ensemble biased model without prior knowledge.

realization with four bosons and four fermions. There is an automorphism of the
algebra called spectral flow. Under spectral flow, the four fermions are
transformed together. In this paper, we study {\it partial spectral flow} where
only two of the four fermions are transformed. Partial spectral flow is applied
to the D1D5 CFT where a marginal deformation moves the CFT away from the free
point. The partial spectral flow is broken by the deformation. We show that
this effect can be studied due to a transformation of the deformation which is
well-defined under partial spectral flow. As a result in the spectrum, we
demonstrate how to compute the second-order energy lift of D1D5P states from
their partial spectral flowed states. We find that D1D5P states related by
partial spectral flow do not have the same lift in general.

reasoning and inference. However, Markov equivalence class considerations mean
it is not always possible to establish edge orientations, which is why many BN
structure learning algorithms cannot orientate all edges from purely
observational data. Moreover, latent confounders can lead to false positive
edges. Relatively few methods have been proposed to address these issues. In
this work, we present the hybrid mFGS-BS (majority rule and Fast Greedy
equivalence Search with Bayesian Scoring) algorithm for structure learning from
discrete data that involves an observational data set and one or more
interventional data sets. The algorithm assumes causal insufficiency in the
presence of latent variables and produces a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG).
Structure learning relies on a hybrid approach and a novel Bayesian scoring
paradigm that calculates the posterior probability of each directed edge being
added to the learnt graph. Experimental results based on well-known networks of
up to 109 variables and 10k sample size show that mFGS-BS improves structure
learning accuracy relative to the state-of-the-art and it is computationally

successfully move to goal locations in their environment. Usually this is done
in a robot-centric manner, where the robot maintains a map with its body in the
center. In swarm robotics applications, where a group of robots need to
coordinate in order to achieve their common goals, robot-centric localization
will not suffice as each member of the swarm has its own frame of reference.
One way to deal with this problem is to create, maintain and share a common map
(global coordinate system), among the members of the swarm. This paper presents
an approach to global localization for a group of robots in unknown, GPS and
landmark free environments that extends the localization scheme of the LadyBug
algorithm. The main idea relies on members of the swarm stay still and act as
beacons, emitting electromagnetic signals. These stationary robots form a
global frame of reference and the rest of the group localize themselves in it
using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The proposed method is
evaluated, and the results obtained from the experiments are promising.

a metallic dimer embedded in a dielectric nanosphere. The low computational

combining error correction and privacy amplification into one single step, this

the post-processing delay. Besides, the reliable and secure communicaiton

of NMR data became available, which makes a review of the early interpretation
possible. Recently, it was shown that all planar $^{17}$O NMR shift and
relaxation data available in the literature point to a temperature independent
but doping dependent pseudogap, very similar to what was proposed from the
electronic entropy. Here we analyze the anisotropy of the shift and relaxation
of planar O to establish whether a single electronic spin component is
applicable, since the planar Cu shift anisotropy clearly fails such a
description. We find that the orbital shift terms deduced from the data are in
agreement with first principle calculations, and the shift data show a
temperature independent anisotropy also in agreement with hyperfine
coefficients predicted by first principles, which also account for the
relaxation anisotropy. Furthermore, we show that the original $^{89}$Y shift
and relaxation data are in agreement with the proposed temperature independent
pseudogap. This pseudogap depends on doping, but also on the family of
materials, and the density of states outside or in the absence of the gap is
universal for the cuprates; this suggests that the entropy should be similar
for all cuprates, as well. Further consequences will be discussed.

protecting users' sensitive data and local DP (LDP), where information needs to
be protected directly on the user side. We first propose two general frameworks
-- one for policy optimization and another for value iteration -- for designing
private, optimistic RL algorithms. We then instantiate these frameworks with
suitable privacy mechanisms to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements, and
simultaneously obtain sublinear regret guarantees. The regret bounds show that
under JDP, the cost of privacy is only a lower order additive term, while for a
stronger privacy protection under LDP, the cost suffered is multiplicative.
Finally, the regret bounds are obtained by a unified analysis, which, we
believe, can be extended beyond tabular MDPs.

present solutions to the Einstein equations in the long-wavelength
approximation, this allow us to obtain expressions for the relativistic density
power spectrum at second and third order, these expressions also include
contributions from primordial non-Gaussianity, in terms of the parameters
$f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$. These results are complemented with
the well known Newtonian solutions for the density contrast and are used in the

$g_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Subsequently, we compute the real space galaxy power
spectrum, including relativistic and primordial non-Gaussianity effects. These
effects come from the relativistic one-loop power spectrum terms and from
factors of the non-linear bias parameter $b_{\mathrm{NL}}$. We use our
modelling to assess the ability of Stage-IV surveys to constrain primordial
non-Gaussianity. Finally, we show how this non-linear bias parameter can

  chirally rotated Schr\""odinger Functional","18 pages, 13 figures",,,,"hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the Renormalisation Group (RG) running of the quark mass, for
$N_f=3$ QCD with Wilson fermions in a mixed action setup, with standard
Schr\""odinger Functional (SF) boundary conditions for sea quarks and chirally
rotated Schr\""odinger Functional ($\chi$SF) boundary conditions for valence
quarks. This necessitates the tuning of the boundary factor $z_f(g_0^2)$ of the
$\chi$SF valence action, in order to ensure that QCD symmetries are fully
recovered in the continuum. The properties of this novel setup are monitored
through the ratios $Z_S/Z_P$ and $\Sigma_S/\Sigma_P$ of the renormalisation
parameters and step scaling functions of the scalar and pseudoscalar densities.
Where comparison is possible, our $Z_S/Z_P$ results are found to agree with
previous determinations, based on a mass ratio method arXiv:1906.03445 and Ward
identities arXiv:2005.01352, arXiv:2101.10969, with Schr\""odinger Functional
boundary conditions. The behaviour of $\Sigma_S/\Sigma_P$ confirms the
theoretical expectations of $\chi$SF QCD, related to the restoration of the
theory's symmetries in the continuum limit. From the step scaling function of
the pseudoscalar density we obtain the quark mass RG-running function from
hadronic to perturbative energy scales. This is fully compatible with the
earlier result obtained in a similar setup for Wilson quarks with Schr\""odinger
Functional boundary conditions arXiv:1802.05243 and provides a strong
universality test for the two lattice setups.

Math. Res. Not",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We prove that the spectrum of the stochastic Airy operator is rigid in the
sense of Ghosh and Peres (Duke Math. J., 166(10):1789--1858, 2017) for
Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions. This proves the rigidity of the
Airy-$\beta$ point process and the soft-edge limit of rank-$1$ perturbations of
Gaussian $\beta$-Ensembles for any $\beta>0$, and solves an open problem
mentioned in a previous work of Bufetov, Nikitin, and Qiu (Mosc. Math. J.,
19(2):217--274, 2019). Our proof uses a combination of the semigroup theory of
the stochastic Airy operator and the techniques for studying insertion and
deletion tolerance of point processes developed by Holroyd and Soo (Electron.
J. Probab., 18:no. 74, 24, 2013).

models. We consider in particular PDE systems which consist in a nonlinear
hyperbolic model plus a linear dispersive perturbation involving an elliptic
operator. We propose two strategies to construct reduced order models for these
problems, with the main focus being the control of the overhead related to the
inversion of the elliptic operators, as well as the robustness with respect to
variations of the flow parameters. In a first approach, only a linear reduction
strategies is applied only to the elliptic component, while the computations of
the nonlinear fluxes are still performed explicitly. This hybrid approach,
referred to as pdROM, is compared to a hyper-reduction strategy based on the
empirical interpolation method to reduce also the nonlinear fluxes. We evaluate
the two approaches on a variety of benchmarks involving a generalized variant
of the BBM-KdV model with a variable bottom, and a one-dimensional enhanced
weakly dispersive shallow water system. The results show the potential of both
approaches in terms of cost reduction, with a clear advantage for the pdROM in
terms of robustness, and for the EIMROM in terms of cost reduction.

fundamental constants. We describe the technological and scientific aims of
QSNET and evaluate its expected performance. We show that in the range of

impose new constraints on violations of fundamental symmetries and a range of
theories beyond the Standard Model, including dark matter and dark energy

hypothesis tests is not fixed in advance and hypotheses are not tested at once,

the FDR was introduced. We investigate the LOND procedure to control the online
FDR in platform trials and propose an extension to allow for interim analyses
with the option of early stopping for efficacy or futility for individual
hypotheses. The power depends sensitively on the prior distribution of effect
sizes, e.g., whether true alternatives are uniformly distributed over time or
not. We consider the choice of design parameters for the LOND procedure to
maximize the overall power and compare the OBrien-Fleming group-sequential

dynamical system where the edge conductivities of a network are regulated by
time-varying mass loads injected on nodes. Motivated by empirical observations,
we assume that conductivities adapt slowly with respect to the characteristic
time of the loads. Furthermore, assuming the loads to be periodic, we derive a
dynamics where the evolution of the system is controlled by a matrix obtained
with the Fourier coefficients of the input loads. Remarkably, we find a
sufficient condition on these coefficients that determines when the resulting
network topologies are trees. We show an example of this on the Bordeaux bus
network where we tune the input loads to interpolate between loopy and tree
topologies. We validate our model on several synthetic networks and provide an
expression for long-time solutions of the original conductivities.

class of proteins or polypeptides that forms pathogenic amyloid aggregates in

plaques in Alzheimer's disease; ii) alpha-synuclein, responsible for Lewy body
formation in Parkinson's disease and iii) IAPP, which is the protein component
of type 2 diabetes-associated islet amyloids. These proteins, known as
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), are present as highly dynamic
conformational ensembles. IDPs can partially (mis) fold into (dys) functional
conformations and accumulate as amyloid aggregates upon interaction with other
cytosolic partners such as proteins or lipid membranes. In addition, an
increasing number of reports link the toxicity of amyloid proteins to their
harmful effects on membrane integrity. Still, the molecular mechanism
underlying the amyloidogenic proteins transfer from the aqueous environment to
the hydrocarbon core of the membrane is poorly understood. This review starts
with a historical overview of the toxicity models of amyloidogenic proteins to
contextualize the more recent lipid-chaperone hypothesis. Then, we report the
early molecular-level events in the aggregation and ion-channel pore formation
of Abeta, IAPP, and alpha-synuclein interacting with model membranes,

reliability and ultra low latency, there is renewed interest in employing cloud
computing to perform high performance but computationally expensive control
schemes like nonlinear model predictive control (MPC). Such a cloud-based
control scheme, however, requires data sharing between the plant (agent) and
the cloud, which raises privacy concerns. This is because privacy-sensitive
information such as system states and control inputs has to be sent to the
cloud and thus can be leaked to attackers for various malicious activities. In
this paper, we develop a simple yet effective privacy-preserved nonlinear MPC
framework via affine masking. Specifically, we consider external eavesdroppers
or honest-but-curious cloud servers that wiretap the communication channel and
intend to infer the local plant's information including state information,
system dynamics, and control inputs. An affine transformation-based
privacy-preservation mechanism is designed to mask the true states and control
signals while reformulating the original MPC problem into a different but
equivalent form. We show that the proposed privacy scheme does not affect the
MPC performance and it preserves the privacy of the local plant such that the
eavesdropper is unable to find a unique value or even estimate a rough range of
the private state and input signals. The proposed method is further extended to
achieve privacy preservation in cloud-based output-feedback MPC. Simulations
are performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed approaches.

The BMC engine is particularly useful in producing seeds that can pass through

manages this process in two main ways using its Tracer subsystem. Firstly, it
uses shared memory to record the labels covered by each test case. Secondly, it
evaluates test cases, and those of high impact are turned into seeds for

are centralized training multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient

problem of radial, isotropic compressible elasticity for a class of stored

result of Vodopyanov, Goldshtein and Reshetnyak) that discontinuous
deformations must have infinite energy. After characterizing the rate at which
this energy blows up, we introduce a modified energy functional which differs
from the original by a null lagrangian, and for which cavitating energy
minimizers with finite energy exist. In particular, the Euler--Lagrange
equations for the modified energy functional are identical to those for the
original problem except for the boundary condition at the inner cavity. This
new boundary condition states that a certain modified radial Cauchy stress
function has to vanish at the inner cavity. This condition corresponds to the
radial Cauchy stress for the original functional diverging to $-\infty$ at the
cavity surface. Many previously known variational results for finite energy
cavitating solutions now follow for the modified functional, such as the
existence of radial energy minimizers, satisfaction of the Euler-Lagrange
equations for such minimizers, and the existence of a critical boundary
displacement for cavitation. We also discuss a numerical scheme for computing
these singular cavitating solutions using regular solutions for punctured

Level Caches (LLCs). Unfortunately, there is limited opportunity to increase
the capacity of LLCs due to the area and power requirements of the underlying
SRAM technology. Interestingly, emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies
promise a feasible alternative to SRAM for LLCs due to their higher area
density. However, NVMs have substantially higher read and write latencies,
which offset their area density benefit. Although researchers have proposed
methods to tolerate NVM's increased write latency, little emphasis has been
placed on reducing the critical NVM read latency.
  To address this problem, this paper proposes Cloak. Cloak exploits data reuse
in the LLC at the page level, to hide NVM read latency. Specifically, on
certain L1 TLB misses to a page, Cloak transfers LLC-resident data belonging to
the page from the LLC NVM array to a set of small SRAM Page Buffers that will
service subsequent requests to this page. Further, to enable the
high-bandwidth, low-latency transfer of lines of a page to the page buffers,
Cloak uses an LLC layout that accelerates the discovery of LLC-resident cache
lines from the page. We evaluate Cloak with full-system simulations of a 4-core
processor across 14 workloads. We find that, on average, Cloak outperforms an
SRAM LLC by 23.8% and an NVM-only LLC by 8.9% -- in both cases, with negligible
additional area. Further, Cloak's ED^2 is 39.9% and 17.5% lower, respectively,

  The pixelated read-out anode used is based on the Timepix4 ASIC
($65~\mathrm{nm}$ CMOS technology) designed in the framework of the Medipix4
collaboration. This ASIC is an array of $512\times448$ pixels distributed on a
$55~\mathrm{\mu m}$ square pitch, with a sensitive area of $\sim
7~\mathrm{cm}^2$. It features $50$-$70~\mathrm{e^{-}}$ equivalent noise charge,
a maximum rate of $2.5~\mathrm{Ghits/s}$, and allows to time-stamp the
leading-edge time and to measure the Time-over-Threshold (ToT) for each pixel.
The pixel-cluster position combined with its ToT information will allow to
reach $5$-$10~\mathrm{\mu m}$ position resolution. This information can also be
used to correct for the leading-edge time-walk achieving a timing resolution of
the order of $10~\mathrm{ps}$.
  The detector will be highly compact thanks to the encapsulated front-end
electronics allowing local data processing and digitization. An FPGA-based data
acquisition board, placed far from the detector, will receive the detector hits
using $16$ electro-optical links operated at $10.24~\mathrm{Gbps}$. The data
acquisition board will decode the information and store the relevant data in a
server for offline analysis.
  These performance will allow significant advances in particle physics, life
sciences, quantum optics or other emerging fields where the detection of single
photons with excellent timing and position resolutions are simultaneously
required.

waveform, and it is very close to caustics that these effects are likely to be

properly the crossover from wave optics to geometrical optics regimes, along
with the Fresnel number, which is the ratio between the Schwarzschild diameter

the angular position of the source with respect to the caustic. By considering
the point mass lens model, we show that in the two-dimensional parameter space,
the nodal and antinodal lines for the transmission factor closely follow
hyperbolas in a wide range of values near the caustic. This allows us to
suggest a simple formula for the onset of geometrical-optics oscillations which

addition, graph neural networks are used to explicitly model the correlation of
the data in different channels. In the end, we propose TFDPM, a general
framework for attack detection tasks in CPSs. It simultaneously extracts
temporal pattern and feature pattern given the historical data. Then extract
features are sent to a conditional diffusion probabilistic model. Predicted
values can be obtained with the conditional generative network and attacks are
detected based on the difference between predicted values and observed values.
In addition, to realize real-time detection, a conditional noise scheduling

show that TFDPM outperforms existing state-of-the-art attack detection methods.

federated learning (FL) has become a promising solution for maximizing the
potential of data-driven models, yet the non-independent and identically
distributed (non-iid) data in medical images is still an outstanding challenge
in real-world practice. The feature heterogeneity caused by diverse scanners or
protocols introduces a drift in the learning process, in both local (client)
and global (server) optimizations, which harms the convergence as well as model
performance. Many previous works have attempted to address the non-iid issue by
tackling the drift locally or globally, but how to jointly solve the two
essentially coupled drifts is still unclear. In this work, we concentrate on
handling both local and global drifts and introduce a new harmonizing framework
called HarmoFL. First, we propose to mitigate the local update drift by
normalizing amplitudes of images transformed into the frequency domain to mimic
a unified imaging setting, in order to generate a harmonized feature space
across local clients. Second, based on harmonized features, we design a client
weight perturbation guiding each local model to reach a flat optimum, where a
neighborhood area of the local optimal solution has a uniformly low loss.
Without any extra communication cost, the perturbation assists the global model
to optimize towards a converged optimal solution by aggregating several local
flat optima. We have theoretically analyzed the proposed method and empirically
conducted extensive experiments on three medical image classification and

compared to standard recurrent neural networks. Still, as these learning
algorithms use error-backpropagation through time (BPTT), they suffer from high
memory requirements, are slow to train, and are incompatible with online
learning. This limits the application of these learning algorithms to
relatively small networks and to limited temporal sequence lengths. Online
approximations to BPTT with lower computational and memory complexity have been
proposed (e-prop, OSTL), but in practice also suffer from memory limitations
and, as approximations, do not outperform standard BPTT training. Here, we show
how a recently developed alternative to BPTT, Forward Propagation Through Time

attempts to minimize an ongoing dynamically regularized risk on the loss. As a
result, FPTT can be computed in an online fashion and has fixed complexity with
respect to the sequence length. When combined with a novel dynamic spiking
neuron model, the Liquid-Time-Constant neuron, we show that SNNs trained with

accuracy on temporal classification tasks. This approach thus makes it feasible
to train SNNs in a memory-friendly online fashion on long sequences and scale

which has relevant economic and environmental impact. Optimal strategies rely
on human expertise for field scouting under favourable conditions to assess the
current presence and extent of disease symptoms. This labor-intensive task is
complicated by the large field area to be scouted, combined with the
millimeter-scale size of the early symptoms to be detected. In view of this,
image-based detection of early disease symptoms is an attractive approach to
automate this process, enabling a potential high throughput monitoring at
sustainable costs.
  Methods. Deep learning has been successfully applied in various domains to
obtain an automatic selection of the relevant image features by learning
filters via a training procedure. Deep learning has recently entered also the
domain of plant disease detection: following this idea, in this work we present
a deep learning approach to automatically recognize powdery mildew on cucumber

multispectral imaging data and we propose the use of autoencoder architectures

features in a compressed space; ii) anomaly detection.
  Results. The two proposed approaches have been assessed by quantitative
indices. The clusterization approach is not fully capable by itself to provide
accurate predictions but it does cater relevant information. Anomaly detection
has instead a significant potential of resolution which could be further
exploited as a prior for supervised architectures with a very limited number of

Yet, the increasing data scale, complexity, and dimension turn the traditional

problem. However, the probability distribution divergence used as the
regularization is too strong, which causes the model cannot capture the

optimal transportation, the PSW distance is a weaker distribution measure
compared with $f$-divergence. In particular, the computation-friendly
eigen-decomposition method is leveraged to find the principal component for
slicing the high-dimensional data. In this case, the Wasserstein distance can
be calculated with the closed-form, even the prior distribution is not

created a dataset of point cloud image pairs and trained the GAN to predict
photorealistic images from LiDAR point clouds containing reflectance and
distance information. Our models learned how to predict realistically looking
images from just point cloud data, even images with black cars. Black cars are
difficult to detect directly from point clouds because of their low level of
reflectivity. This approach might be used in the future to perform visual
object recognition on photorealistic images generated from LiDAR point clouds.
In addition to the conventional LiDAR system, a second system that generates
photorealistic images from LiDAR point clouds would run simultaneously for
visual object recognition in real-time. In this way, we might preserve the
supremacy of LiDAR and benefit from using photo-realistic images for visual
object recognition without the usage of any camera. In addition, this approach
could be used to colorize point clouds without the usage of any camera images.

proportion of people reporting anxiety is 26%, and depression is 34% points.
Disentangling associational and causal contributions of behavior, COVID-19
cases, and economic distress on mental distress will dictate different
mitigation strategies to reduce long-term pandemic-related mental distress.
Methods We use the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) April 2020 to February 2021
data to examine mental distress among U.S. citizens attributable to COVID-19.
We combined HPS survey data with publicly available state-level weekly:
COVID-19 case and death data from the Centers for Disease Control, public
policies, and Apple and Google mobility data. Finally, we constructed economic
and mental distress measures to estimate structural models with lag dependent
variables to tease out public health policies' associational and causal path
coefficients on economic and mental distress. Findings From April 2020 to
February 2021, we found that anxiety and depression had steadily climbed in the
U.S. By design, mobility restrictions primarily affected public health policies
where businesses and restaurants absorbed the biggest hit. Period t-1 COVID-19
cases increased job loss by 4.1% and economic distress by 6.3% points in the
same period. Job-loss and housing insecurity in t-1 increased period t mental
distress by 29.1% and 32.7%, respectively. However, t-1 food insecurity
decreased mental distress by 4.9% in time t. The pandemic-related potential
causal path coefficient of period t-1 economic distress on period t depression
is 57.8%, and anxiety is 55.9%. Thus, we show that period t-1 COVID-19 case
information, behavior, and economic distress may be causally associated with
pandemic related period t mental distress.

casualties following drone strikes in undeclared theaters of war. The policy
calibrated Obamas approval of strikes against the near certainty of no civilian
casualties. Scholars do not empirically study the merits of Obamas policy.
Rather, they rely on descriptive trends for civilian casualties in Pakistan to
justify competing claims for the policys impact. We provide a novel estimate
for the impact of Obamas policy for civilian casualties in Pakistan following
U.S. drone strikes. We employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the
effect of Obamas policy for civilian casualties, strike precision, and adverted
civilian casualties. We find a discontinuity in civilian casualties
approximately two years before Obamas policy announcement, corroborating our
primary research including interviews with senior officials responsible for
implementing the near certainty standard. After confirming the sharp cutoff, we
estimate the policy resulted in a reduction of 12 civilian deaths per month or
2 casualties per strike. The policy also enhanced the precision of U.S. drone
strikes to the point that they only killed the intended targets. Finally, we
use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate that the policy adverted 320 civilian
casualties. We then conduct a Value of Statistical Life calculation to show
that the adverted civilian casualties represent a gain of 80 to 260 million
U.S. dollars. In addition to conditioning social and political outcomes, then,
the near certainty standard also imposed economic implications that are much
less studied.

  Method: Application to Multi-Object Tracking",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kalman filters are widely used for object tracking, where process and
measurement noise are usually considered accurately known and constant.
However, the exact known and constant assumptions do not always hold in
practice. For example, when lidar is used to track noncooperative targets, the
measurement noise is different under different distances and weather
conditions. In addition, the process noise changes with the object's motion
state, especially when the tracking object is a pedestrian, and the process
noise changes more frequently. This paper proposes a new
estimation-calibration-correction closed-loop estimation method to estimate the
Kalman filter process and measurement noise covariance matrices online. First,
we decompose the noise covariance matrix into an element distribution matrix
and noise intensity and improve the Sage filter to estimate the element
distribution matrix. Second, we propose a calibration method to accurately
diagnose the noise intensity deviation. We then propose a correct method to
adaptively correct the noise intensity online. Third, under the assumption that
the system is detectable, the unbiased and convergence of the proposed method
is mathematically proven. Simulation results prove the effectiveness and
reliability of the proposed method. Finally, we apply the proposed method to
multiobject tracking of lidar and evaluate it on the official KITTI server. The
proposed method on the KITTI pedestrian multiobject tracking leaderboard
(http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets /kitti/eval_tracking.php) surpasses all
existing methods using lidar, proving the feasibility of the method in

of confounding bias. Confounding occurs when a variable affects both the
treatment and the outcome. Traditional methods such as propensity score
matching estimate treatment effects by conditioning on the confounders. Recent
literature has presented new methods that use machine learning to predict the
counterfactuals in observational studies which then allow for estimating
treatment effects. These studies however, have been applied to real world data
where the true treatment effects have not been known. This study aimed to study
the effectiveness of this counterfactual prediction method by simulating two
main scenarios: with and without confounding. Each type also included linear
and non-linear relationships between input and output data. The key item in the
simulations was that we generated known true causal effects. Linear regression,
lasso regression and random forest models were used to predict the
counterfactuals and treatment effects. These were compared these with the true
treatment effect as well as a naive treatment effect. The results show that the
most important factor in whether this machine learning method performs well, is
the degree of non-linearity in the data. Surprisingly, for both non-confounding
\textit{and} confounding, the machine learning models all performed well on the
linear dataset. However, when non-linearity was introduced, the models
performed very poorly. Therefore under the conditions of this simulation study,
the machine learning method performs well under conditions of linearity, even
if confounding is present, but at this stage should not be trusted when
non-linearity is introduced.

of the main challenges in Maintenance and Rehabilitation (M&R) practices is to
determine maintenance type and timing. This research proposes a framework using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) based on the Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP)
database to determine the type and timing of M&R practices. A predictive DNN
model is first developed in the proposed algorithm, which serves as the
Environment for the RL algorithm. For the Policy estimation of the RL model,
both DQN and PPO models are developed. However, PPO has been selected in the
end due to better convergence and higher sample efficiency. Indicators used in
this study are International Roughness Index (IRI) and Rutting Depth (RD).
Initially, we considered Cracking Metric (CM) as the third indicator, but it
was then excluded due to the much fewer data compared to other indicators,
which resulted in lower accuracy of the results. Furthermore, in
cost-effectiveness calculation (reward), we considered both the economic and
environmental impacts of M&R treatments. Costs and environmental impacts have
been evaluated with paLATE 2.0 software. Our method is tested on a hypothetical
case study of a six-lane highway with 23 kilometers length located in Texas,
which has a warm and wet climate. The results propose a 20-year M&R plan in
which road condition remains in an excellent condition range. Because the early
state of the road is at a good level of service, there is no need for heavy
maintenance practices in the first years. Later, after heavy M&R actions, there
are several 1-2 years of no need for treatments. All of these show that the
proposed plan has a logical result. Decision-makers and transportation agencies
can use this scheme to conduct better maintenance practices that can prevent
budget waste and, at the same time, minimize the environmental impacts.
