application domains. However, they require important computational and memory
resources, which severely hinders their deployment, notably on mobile devices
or for real-time applications. Neural networks usually involve a large number
of parameters, which correspond to the weights of the network. Such parameters,
obtained with the help of a training process, are determinant for the
performance of the network. However, they are also highly redundant. The
pruning methods notably attempt to reduce the size of the parameter set, by
identifying and removing the irrelevant weights. In this paper, we examine the
impact of the training strategy on the pruning efficiency. Two training
modalities are considered and compared: (1) fine-tuned and (2) from scratch.
The experimental results obtained on four datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN and
Caltech101) and for two different CNNs (VGG16 and MobileNet) demonstrate that a
network that has been pre-trained on a large corpus (e.g. ImageNet) and then
fine-tuned on a particular dataset can be pruned much more efficiently (up to
80% of parameter reduction) than the same network trained from scratch.

from tidal decay is an upper limit assuming the stars are not tidally

sources in the \textit{Kepler} field, and find $\sim$ 70 additional detached
EBs with low eccentricities that have estimated timing precision better than 1
second. We illustrate the method with a prototypical, precisely timed EB using
an archival \textit{Kepler} light curve and a modern synthetic \textit{HST}
light curve (which provides a decade baseline). This novel method establishes a
realistic possibility for obtaining fundamental Galactic parameters using
eclipse timing to measure Galactic accelerations, along with other emerging new
methods, including pulsar timing and extreme precision radial velocity
observations. This acceleration signal grows quadratically with time.
Therefore, given baselines established in the near-future for distant EBs, we

convolution. Finally, the image features are effectively retained. CA Module

promising formation mechanism for super-Earths, where the host metallicity is
already established. To better understand this planet forming scenario, we
construct a toy inner disc model and focus on the evolution of dust trapped in
the bump, taking into account the supply from drifting pebbles and loss due to
funnel flows. We develop an implicit coagulation-fragmentation code,
$\mathtt{Rubble}$, and perform a suite of simulations to evolve the local dust
size distributions. Our study for the first time considers dust feedback effect
on turbulent diffusion in this kind of model. We report that efficient dust
growth and significant accumulation of dust mass is possible in less turbulent
disc with sturdier solids and with faster external supply, laying out a solid
foundation for further growth towards planetesimals and planetary embryos. We
further find that, depending on the dominant process, solid mass may
predominantly accumulate in cm-sized grains or particles in runaway growth,
indicating different ways of forming planetesimals. Furthermore, these various
outcomes show different efficiencies in saving dust from funnel flows,
suggesting that they may be distinguishable by constraining the opacity of
funnel flows. Also, these diverse dust behaviours may help explain the observed
dipper stars and rapidly varying shadows in PPDs.

strengthening pre-existing inequalities that disproportionately affect certain
groups.
  In this paper we introduce a model to simulate the feedback loop created by
multiple rounds of interactions between users and a link recommender in a
social network. This allows us to study the long-term consequences of those
particular recommendation algorithms. Our model is equipped with several
parameters to control (i) the level of homophily in the network, (ii) the
relative size of the groups, (iii) the choice among several state-of-the-art
link recommenders, and (iv) the choice among three different user behavior
models, that decide which recommendations are accepted or rejected.
  Our extensive experimentation with the proposed model shows that a minority
group, if homophilic enough, can get a disproportionate advantage in exposure
from all link recommenders. Instead, when it is heterophilic, it gets
under-exposed. Moreover, while the homophily level of the minority affects the
speed of the growth of the disparate exposure, the relative size of the
minority affects the magnitude of the effect. Finally, link recommenders
strengthen exposure inequalities at the individual level, exacerbating the
""rich-get-richer"" effect: this happens for both the minority and the majority
class and independently of their level of homophily.

individuals using DM. Nine individuals (53%) were healthy and eight (47%) had
HbSC-SCD. Mean SI was significantly lower in SCD than in control group (0.69

of the total baryon budget even in the most massive simulated galaxy clusters
($M_{200} \approx 10^{14.5} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$), with the consequence that
the total baryon budget exceeds the cosmic average if ejected gas is included.
We find that gas is only prevented from being accreted onto haloes for $M_{200}

the total baryon budget for $M_{200} < 10^{11} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$, with
ejected gas making up most of the remaining half. For metals, most of the mass
that is not locked into stars has been ejected beyond the virial radius, at
least for $M_{200} < 10^{13} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$. Finally, within the virial
radius we find that most of the mass in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) has

material trapped above their apexes via the Lorentz force. Subsequently, the
majority of the mass drained down the fieldlines towards one or both footpoints
under gravity. Material with large horizontal velocities could also elevated in
rising fieldlines, creating somewhat parabolic motions, but material was not
generally moving upward along a stationary magnetic fieldline during loading.
  Conclusions: The processes observed in the simulation are plausible
additional scenarios. Criteria for observing such events are described. It is
desirable that our simulations can also form more densely-packed fibrils from
material fed from the base of field footpoints. Experimental parameters
required to achieve this are discussed.

Pb(Ta$_{1+x}$Se$_2$)$_2$ exhibits a unique two-step first-order structural
phase transition at around 230 K. The transitions are solely associated with
the stacking degree of freedom, evolving from a high temperature phase with ABC
stacking and symmetry $R3m$ to an intermediate phase with AB stacking and
$P3m1$, and finally to a low temperature phase with again symmetry $R3m$, but
with ACB stacking. Each step involves a rigid slide of building blocks by a
vector [1/3, 2/3, 0]. Intriguingly, gigantic lattice contractions occur at the
transitions on warming. At low temperature, bulk superconductivity with
$T_\textrm{c}\approx$ 1.8 K is observed. The underlying physics of the
structural phase transitions are discussed from first-principle calculations.
The symmetry analysis reveals topological nodal lines in the band structure.

solutions, e.g. a d-dimensional compact space, and this choice is critical for
getting the best results at a reasonable budget. Unfortunately, determining a
high quality search space can be challenging in many applications. For example,
when tuning hyperparameters for machine learning pipelines on a new problem
given a limited budget, one must strike a balance between excluding potentially
promising regions and keeping the search space small enough to be tractable.
The goal of this work is to motivate -- through example applications in tuning
deep neural networks -- the problem of predicting the quality of search spaces
conditioned on budgets, as well as to provide a simple scoring method based on
a utility function applied to a probabilistic response surface model, similar
to Bayesian optimization. We show that the method we present can compute
meaningful budget-conditional scores in a variety of situations. We also
provide experimental evidence that accurate scores can be useful in
constructing and pruning search spaces. Ultimately, we believe scoring search
spaces should become standard practice in the experimental workflow for deep
learning.

reliably described within the context of the relativistic
magneto-hydrodynamics. Our model calculations are based on the Fermi
acceleration mechanism through which the primary particles (mainly protons) of
the jet are accelerated. As a result, a small portion of thermal protons of the
jet acquire relativistic energies, through shock-waves generated into the jet
plasma. From the inelastic collisions of fast (non-thermal) protons with the
thermal (cold) ones, secondary charged and neutral particles (pions, kaons,
muons, $\eta$-particles, etc.) are created as well as electromagnetic radiation
from the radio wavelength band, to X-rays and even to very high energy
gamma-rays. One of our main goals is, through the appropriate solution of the
transport equation and taking into account the various mechanisms that cause
energy losses to the particles, to study the secondary particle concentrations
within hadronic astrophysical jets. After testing our method on the Galactic
MQs SS 433 and Cyg X-1, as a concrete extragalactic binary system, we examine

that by carefully choosing a set of such bridges and assigning an appropriate

rare events of a target stochastic process while faithfully preserving the
statistics of these rate trajectories. Further, we also compare the stochastic
bridges produced using our method to the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB)

that the paths produced using our method, encoding the full statistics of the

extended periods of time. Further, they become out-of-date when changes in the
system occur. To address these challenges, we investigate online learning
techniques that automatically reduce the number of available data sources for
model training. We present an online algorithm called Online Stable Feature Set
Algorithm (OSFS), which selects a small feature set from a large number of
available data sources after receiving a small number of measurements. The
algorithm is initialized with a feature ranking algorithm, a feature set
stability metric, and a search policy. We perform an extensive experimental
evaluation of this algorithm using traces from an in-house testbed and from a
data center in operation. We find that OSFS achieves a massive reduction in the
size of the feature set by 1-3 orders of magnitude on all investigated
datasets. Most importantly, we find that the accuracy of a predictor trained on
a OSFS-produced feature set is somewhat better than when the predictor is
trained on a feature set obtained through offline feature selection. OSFS is
thus shown to be effective as an online feature selection algorithm and robust
regarding the sample interval used for feature selection. We also find that,
when concept drift in the data underlying the model occurs, its effect can be
mitigated by recomputing the feature set and retraining the prediction model.

we present and evaluate a tool-supported approach, called CiRA, for causality
detection. We conclude with a second case study where we demonstrate the
applicability of our tool and investigate the impact of causality on NL
requirements. Results: The first case study shows that causality constitutes
around 28% of all NL requirements sentences. We then demonstrate that our
detection tool achieves a macro-F1 score of 82% on real-world data and that it
outperforms related approaches with an average gain of 11.06% in macro-Recall
and 11.43% in macro-Precision. Finally, our second case study corroborates the
positive correlations of causality with features of NL requirements.
Conclusion: The results strengthen our confidence in the eligibility of causal
relations for downstream reuse, while our tool and publicly available data
constitute a first step in the ongoing endeavors of utilizing causality in RE
and beyond.

describing an everyday scenario given several concepts, which has attracted
much attention recently. However, existing models cannot perform as well as
humans, since sentences they produce are often implausible and grammatically
incorrect. In this paper, inspired by the process of humans creating sentences,
we propose a novel Knowledge-enhanced Commonsense Generation framework, termed
KGR^4, consisting of four stages: Retrieval, Retrospect, Refine, Rethink. Under
this framework, we first perform retrieval to search for relevant sentences
from external corpus as the prototypes. Then, we train the generator that
either edits or copies these prototypes to generate candidate sentences, of
which potential errors will be fixed by an autoencoder-based refiner. Finally,
we select the output sentence from candidate sentences produced by generators
with different hyper-parameters. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on
the CommonGen benchmark strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework. Particularly, KGR^4 obtains 33.56 SPICE points in the official
leaderboard, outperforming the previously-reported best result by 2.49 SPICE
points and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

and shape of all the people as well as their relative depth. Inferring the
depth of a person in an image, however, is fundamentally ambiguous without
knowing their height. This is particularly problematic when the scene contains
people of very different sizes, e.g. from infants to adults. To solve this, we
need several things. First, we develop a novel method to infer the poses and
depth of multiple people in a single image. While previous work that estimates
multiple people does so by reasoning in the image plane, our method, called
BEV, adds an additional imaginary Bird's-Eye-View representation to explicitly
reason about depth. BEV reasons simultaneously about body centers in the image
and in depth and, by combing these, estimates 3D body position. Unlike prior
work, BEV is a single-shot method that is end-to-end differentiable. Second,
height varies with age, making it impossible to resolve depth without also
estimating the age of people in the image. To do so, we exploit a 3D body model
space that lets BEV infer shapes from infants to adults. Third, to train BEV,
we need a new dataset. Specifically, we create a ""Relative Human"" (RH) dataset
that includes age labels and relative depth relationships between the people in
the images. Extensive experiments on RH and AGORA demonstrate the effectiveness
of the model and training scheme. BEV outperforms existing methods on depth
reasoning, child shape estimation, and robustness to occlusion. The code and
dataset are released for research purposes.

mechanisms shall be done with each frame independently. To achieve this,
SeqFormer locates an instance in each frame and aggregates temporal information
to learn a powerful representation of a video-level instance, which is used to

achieved naturally without tracking branches or post-processing. On
YouTube-VIS, SeqFormer achieves 47.4 AP with a ResNet-50 backbone and 49.0 AP

  J. Matrix Anal. Appl",,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a low rank tensor plays a major
role in data analysis and signal processing by allowing for unique recovery of
underlying factors. However, it is well known that the low rank CPD
approximation problem is ill-posed. That is, a tensor may fail to have a best
rank $R$ CPD approximation when $R>1$.
  This article gives deterministic bounds for the existence of best low rank
tensor approximations over $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$.
More precisely, given a tensor $\mathcal{T} \in \mathbb{K}^{I \times I \times
I}$ of rank $R \leq I$, we compute the radius of a Frobenius norm ball centered
at $\mathcal{T}$ in which best $\mathbb{K}$-rank $R$ approximations are
guaranteed to exist. In addition we show that every $\mathbb{K}$-rank $R$
tensor inside of this ball has a unique canonical polyadic decomposition. This
neighborhood may be interpreted as a neighborhood of ""mathematical truth"" in
with CPD approximation and computation is well-posed.
  In pursuit of these bounds, we describe low rank tensor decomposition as a
``joint generalized eigenvalue"" problem. Using this framework, we show that,
under mild assumptions, a low rank tensor which has rank strictly greater than
border rank is defective in the sense of algebraic and geometric multiplicities
for joint generalized eigenvalues. Bounds for existence of best low rank
approximations are then obtained by establishing perturbation theoretic results
for the joint generalized eigenvalue problem. In this way we establish a
connection between existence of best low rank approximations and the tensor
spectral norm. In addition we solve a ""tensor Procrustes problem"" which
examines orthogonal compressions for pairs of tensors.
  The main results of the article are illustrated by a variety of numerical
experiments.

however, the locations and times when salty liquid water could emerge are not
yet well known. In this paper we present our results of likely brine formation
on Mars, their proposed locations and seasons, as well as the possible limiting
factors. For our calculations we used the data of Laboratoire de
M\'et\'eorologie Dynamique Mars General Circulation Model version 5. The
results show that from L$_s$ 35$^\circ$ - L$_s$ 160$^\circ$, between 9 PM and
11 PM there is a good chance for calcium perchlorate deliquescence above
30$^\circ$ N, while in this zone the ideal regions are concentrated mostly to
Acidalia Planitia and Utopia Planitia between 1 AM and 3 AM. We found that in
the Southern Hemisphere, between L$_s$ 195$^\circ$ and L$_s$ 320$^\circ$, there
is a noticeable, but weaker band in the vicinity of 60$^\circ$ S, and both
Argyre Planitia and Hellas Planitia show some chance for brine formation.
According to our statistics the key limiting factor of deliquescence could be
relative humidity in most cases. Our results suggest that during summer --
early fall seasons, there could be deliquescence in both hemispheres in
specific areas from the late evening until the early morning hours. There are
only few studies detailing the geological and temporal distribution of brine
formation through deliquescence, thus this work could be used as a good guide
for future landing site analysis or in choosing a specific location for further
research.

non-crossing constraint. The offline version was introduced by Atallah in 1985
and the online version was introduced and studied more recently by Bose et al.
The input to the problem consists of a sequence of points, and upon arrival of
a point an algorithm can match it with a previously unmatched point provided
that line segments corresponding to the matched edges do not intersect. The
decisions are irrevocable, and while an optimal offline solution always matches
all the points, an online algorithm cannot match all the points in the worst
case, unless it is given some side information, i.e., advice. We study two
versions of this problem -- monomchromatic (MNM) and bichromatic (BNM).
  We show that advice complexity of solving BNM optimally on a circle (or, more
generally, on inputs in a convex position) is tightly bounded by the logarithm
of the $n^\text{th}$ Catalan number from above and below. This result corrects
the previous claim of Bose et al. that the advice complexity is $\log(n!)$. At
the heart of the result is a connection between non-crossing constraint in
online inputs and $231$-avoiding property of permutations of $n$ elements We
also show a lower bound of $n/3-1$ and an upper bound of $3n$ on the advice
complexity for MNM on a plane. This gives an exponential improvement over the
previously best known lower bound and an improvement in the constant of the
leading term in the upper bound. In addition, we establish a lower bound of
$\frac{\alpha}{2}\infdiv{\frac{2(1-\alpha)}{\alpha}}{1/4}n$ on the advice
complexity for achieving competitive ratio $\alpha$ for MNM on a circle.
Standard tools from advice complexity, such as partition trees and reductions
from string guessing problem, do not seem to apply to MNM/BNM, so we have to
design our lower bounds from first principles.

achieve this, early studies have designed influence function (IF) to measure
the effect of removing a single training point on neural networks. However, the
classic implicit Hessian-vector product (IHVP) method for calculating IF is
fragile, and theoretical analysis of IF in the context of neural networks is
still lacking. To this end, we utilize the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory
to calculate IF for the neural network trained with regularized mean-square
loss, and prove that the approximation error can be arbitrarily small when the
width is sufficiently large for two-layer ReLU networks. We analyze the error
bound for the classic IHVP method in the over-parameterized regime to
understand when and why it fails or not. In detail, our theoretical analysis
reveals that (1) the accuracy of IHVP depends on the regularization term, and
is pretty low under weak regularization; (2) the accuracy of IHVP has a
significant correlation with the probability density of corresponding training
points. We further borrow the theory from NTK to understand the IFs better,
including quantifying the complexity for influential samples and depicting the
variation of IFs during the training dynamics. Numerical experiments on
real-world data confirm our theoretical results and demonstrate our findings.

demographic related outcomes. Fitting and interpreting APC models to data in
equal intervals (equal age and period widths) is non-trivial due to the
structural link between the three temporal effects (given two, the third can
always be found) causing the well-known identification problem. The usual
method for resolving the structural link identification problem is to base a
model off identifiable quantities. It is common to find health and demographic
data in unequal intervals, this encounters further identification problems on
top of the structural link. We highlight the new issues by showing quantities
that were identifiable for equal intervals are no longer identifiable for
unequal data. Furthermore, through extensive simulation studies, we show how
previous methods for unequal APC models are not always appropriate due to their
sensitivity to the choice of functions used to approximate the true temporal
functions. We propose a new method for modelling unequal APC data using
penalised smoothing splines. Our proposal effectively resolves any additional

demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal, we conclude with an application

of the tensor. A GEVD provides an algebraic approximation of the CPD which can
then be used as an initialization in optimization routines.
  While in the noiseless setting GEVD exactly recovers the CPD, it has recently
been shown that pencil-based computations such as GEVD are not stable. In this
article we present an algebraic method for approximation of a CPD which greatly
improves on the accuracy of GEVD. Our method is still fundamentally
pencil-based; however, rather than using a single pencil and computing all of
its generalized eigenvectors, we use many different pencils and in each pencil
compute generalized eigenspaces corresponding to sufficiently well-separated
generalized eigenvalues. The resulting ""generalized eigenspace decomposition""
is significantly more robust to noise than the classical GEVD.
  Accuracy of the generalized eigenspace decomposition is examined both
empirically and theoretically. In particular, we provide a deterministic
perturbation theoretic bound which is predictive of error in the computed

examples is an important yet challenging problem for secure deep learning.
Across existing defense techniques, adversarial training with Projected
Gradient Decent (PGD) is amongst the most effective. Adversarial training
solves a min-max optimization problem, with the \textit{inner maximization}
generating adversarial examples by maximizing the classification loss, and the
\textit{outer minimization} finding model parameters by minimizing the loss on
adversarial examples generated from the inner maximization. A criterion that
measures how well the inner maximization is solved is therefore crucial for
adversarial training. In this paper, we propose such a criterion, namely
First-Order Stationary Condition for constrained optimization (FOSC), to
quantitatively evaluate the convergence quality of adversarial examples found
in the inner maximization. With FOSC, we find that to ensure better robustness,
it is essential to use adversarial examples with better convergence quality at
the \textit{later stages} of training. Yet at the early stages, high
convergence quality adversarial examples are not necessary and may even lead to
poor robustness. Based on these observations, we propose a \textit{dynamic}
training strategy to gradually increase the convergence quality of the
generated adversarial examples, which significantly improves the robustness of
adversarial training. Our theoretical and empirical results show the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

an example data set from a colon cancer trial. We compare the Bayesian
parametric survival analysis and frequentist models with AIC/BIC model
selection in fixed-n and sequential designs with a simulation study. In the
example data set, the Bayesian framework provided evidence for the absence of a
positive treatment effect on disease-free survival in patients with resected
colon cancer. Furthermore, the Bayesian sequential analysis would have
terminated the trial 10.3 months earlier than the standard frequentist
analysis. In a simulation study with sequential designs, the Bayesian framework
on average reached a decision in almost half the time required by the
frequentist counterparts, while maintaining the same power, and an appropriate
false-positive rate. Under model misspecification, the Bayesian framework
resulted in higher false-negative rate compared to the frequentist
counterparts, which resulted in a higher proportion of undecided trials. In
fixed-n designs, the Bayesian framework showed slightly higher power, slightly
elevated error rates, and lower bias and RMSE when estimating treatment effects
in small samples. We have made the analytic approach readily available in RoBSA

applied to parametric survival analyses. It uses data more efficiently, is

The Gorkov approach to self-consistent Green's function theory
has been formulated in [V. Som\`a, T. Duguet, C. Barbieri, Phys. Rev. C 84,
064317 (2011)]. Over the past decade, it has become a method of reference for
first-principle computations of semi-magic nuclear isotopes. The currently
available implementation is limited to a second-order self-energy and neglects
particle-number non-conserving terms arising from contracting three-particle
forces with anomalous propagators. For nuclear physics applications, this is
sufficient to address first-order energy differences, ground-state radii and
moments on an accurate enough basis. However, addressing absolute binding
energies, fine spectroscopic details of $N\pm1$ particle systems or delicate
quantities such as second-order energy differences associated to pairing gaps,
requires to go to higher truncation orders.
  Purpose. The formalism is extended to third order in the algebraic
diagrammatic construction (ADC) expansion with two-body Hamiltonians.
  Methods. The expansion of Gorkov propagators in Feynman diagrams is combined
with the algebraic diagrammatic construction up to the third order as an
organization scheme to generate the Gorkov self-energy.
  Results. Algebraic expressions for the static and dynamic contributions to
the self-energy, along with equations for the matrix elements of the Gorkov
eigenvalue problem, are derived. It is first done for a general basis before
specifying the set of equations to the case of spherical systems displaying
rotational symmetry. Workable approximations to the full self-consistency
problem are also elaborated on. The formalism at third order it thus complete
for a general two-body Hamiltonian.
  Conclusion. Working equations for the full Gorkov-ADC(3) are now available
for numerical implementation.

ground state subspace. This family is indexed by gapped boundary conditions
encoded into module 2-categories over the input spherical fusion 2-category.
Individual tensors are characterised by symmetry conditions with respect to
non-local operators acting on entanglement degrees of freedom. In the case of
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we show that the symmetry operators
form the fusion 2-categories $\mathsf{2Vec}_G$ of $G$-graded 2-vector spaces
and $\mathsf{2Rep}(G)$ of 2-representations of $G$, respectively. In virtue of
the Morita equivalence between $\mathsf{2Vec}_G$ and $\mathsf{2Rep}(G)$ --
which we explicitly establish -- the topological order can be realised as the
Drinfel'd centre of either 2-category of operators; this is a realisation of
the electromagnetic duality of the theory. Specialising to the case $G =
\mathbb Z_2$, we recover tensor network representations that were recently
introduced, as well as the relation between the electromagnetic duality of a
pure (3+1)d $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory and the Kramers-Wannier duality of a
boundary (2+1)d Ising model.

stars, making them promising for next-generation atmospheric characterization
studies. The $TESS$ mission has greatly increased the number of known M dwarf
planets that we can use to perform population studies, allowing us to explore
how the rocky planet occurrence rate varies with host radius, following in the
footsteps of past work with $Kepler$ data. In this paper, we use simulations to
assess $TESS$'s yield of small ($0.5\,R_\oplus \,<\,R_p\,<\,2\,R_\oplus$)
planet candidates around nearby ($d\,<\,30$ pc) M dwarfs. We highlight the
underappreciated fact that while $TESS$ was indeed expected to find a large
number of planets around M dwarfs overall, it was not expected to have a high
planetary yield for the latest M dwarfs. Furthermore, we find that $TESS$ has
detected fewer planets around stars with $R_*\,<\,0.3 R_\odot$ than even was
expected (11 observed vs. $24\,\pm\,5$ expected). We find evidence that the
photometric noise of stars in the $TESS$ bandpass increases with decreasing
radius for M dwarfs. However, this trend cannot explain the observed
distribution of planets. Our main conclusions are: (1) the planet occurrence
rate likely doesn't increase, and may decrease for the latest M dwarfs; and (2)
there are at least 17, and potentially three times that number, transiting
planets around nearby late M dwarfs that still won't be detected by the end of

master equations. For fermionic and bosonic systems that are quasi-free, i.e.,
with Hamiltonians that are quadratic in the ladder operators and Lindblad
operators that are linear in the ladder operators, we derive the equation of
motion for the covariance matrix. This determines the evolution of Gaussian
initial states and the steady states, which are also Gaussian. Using ladder
super-operators (a.k.a. third quantization), we show how the Liouvillian can be
transformed to a many-body Jordan normal form which also reveals the full
many-body spectrum. Extending previous work by Prosen and Seligman, we treat
fermionic and bosonic systems on equal footing with Majorana operators, shorten
and complete some derivations, also address the odd-parity sector for fermions,
give a criterion for the existence of bosonic steady states, cover
non-diagonalizable Liouvillians also for bosons, and include quadratic systems.
In extension of the quasi-free open systems, quadratic open systems comprise
additional Hermitian Lindblad operators that are quadratic in the ladder
operators. While Gaussian states may then evolve into non-Gaussian states, the
Liouvillian can still be transformed to a useful block-triangular form, and the
equations of motion for $k$-point Green's functions form a closed hierarchy.
Based on this formalism, results on criticality and dissipative phase
transitions in such models are discussed in a companion paper
[arXiv:2204.05346].

Database Search Result (DSR) Disambiguation, a novel task that focuses on

ability to deal with ambiguous scenarios, without sacrificing performance on
unmodified turns. Furthermore, pre-fine tuning and multi-task learning help our
model to improve performance on DSR-disambiguation even in the absence of

microscopic scales, has become a problem of broad interdisciplinary interest.
In particular, estimation of the inhomogeneous transport coefficients, e.g. the
diffusion coefficient or the heat conductivity which shape important processes
in biology and engineering, is a challenging task. The analysis of such systems
is further complicated, because two alternative formulations of the
inhomogeneous transport equations exist in the literature -- the Smoluchowski
and Fokker-Planck equations, which are also related to the so-called
Ito-Stratonovich dilemma. Using the theory of statistical physics, we show that
the two formulations, usually regarded as distinct models, are physically
equivalent. From this result we develop efficient estimates for the transverse
space-dependent diffusion coefficient in fluids near a phase boundary. Our
method requires only measurements of escape probabilities and mean exit times
of molecules leaving a narrow spatial region. We test our estimates in three
case studies: (i) a Langevin model of a Buettikker-Landauer ratchet; atomistic
molecular-dynamics simulations of liquid-water molecules in contact with (ii)
vapor and (iii) soap (surfactant) film which has promising applications in
physical chemistry. Our analysis reveals that near the surfactant monolayer the
mobility of water molecules is slowed down almost twice with respect to the
bulk liquid. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of water correlates with the
transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic parts of the film.

saturon of a calculable renormalizable theory obeys the same extremality bound
on the spin as the black hole. Correspondingly, a black hole with extremal spin
emerges as a graviton condensate with vorticity. This offers a topological
explanation for the stability of extremal black holes against Hawking
evaporation. Next, we show that in the presence of mobile charges, the global
vortex traps a magnetic flux of the gauge field. This can have
macroscopically-observable consequences. For instance, the most powerful jets
observed in active galactic nuclei can potentially be accounted for. As a
signature, such emissions can occur even without a magnetized accretion disk
surrounding the black hole. The flux entrapment can provide an observational

nonadiabatic STT have been debated theoretically for nearly two decades, but
with unanimous conclusion that they should be significant only in narrow DWs.

demonstrate that our microscopically, and without any simplifications of prior
derivations like effectively static DW, extracted nonadiabatic STT: (i) does
not decay, but instead saturates at a finite value, with increasing $w$ of a
moving DW ensuring entry into the adiabatic limit, which we characterize by
showing that electronic spins do not reflect from the static DW in this limit;

galaxy stellar populations, which we can access using absorption-line
spectroscopy. Here we explore the large LEGA-C survey (DR3) to investigate the
role of the environment and stellar mass on stellar populations at z~0.6-1.0 in
the COSMOS field. Leveraging the statistical power and depth of LEGA-C, we
reveal significant gradients in D4000 and H-delta equivalent widths (EWs)
distributions over the stellar mass vs environment 2D spaces for the massive
galaxy population (M>10^10 M$_{\odot}$) at z~0.6-1.0. D4000 and H-delta EWs
primarily depend on stellar mass, but they also depend on environment at fixed
stellar mass. By splitting the sample into centrals and satellites, and in
terms of star-forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies, we reveal that the
significant environmental trends of D4000 and H-delta EW when controlling for
stellar mass are driven by quiescent galaxies. Regardless of being centrals or
satellites, star-forming galaxies reveal D4000 and H-delta EWs which depend
strongly on their stellar mass and are completely independent of the
environment at 0.6<z<1.0. The environmental trends seen for satellite galaxies
are fully driven by the trends that hold only for quiescent galaxies, combined
with the strong environmental dependency of the quiescent fraction at fixed
stellar mass. Our results are consistent with recent predictions from
simulations that point towards massive galaxies forming first in over-densities
or the most compact dark matter haloes.

detect the back cone (behind the galaxy), and confirm previous results of a

cosmic-ray (CR) species. The achieved percent-level accuracy gives access to
small spectral differences among the different species and, in turn, this
allows scrutinizing the universality of CR acceleration, which is expected in
the standard scenario of CR shock acceleration. While pre-AMS-02 data already
indicated a violation of the universality between protons and helium, it is
still an open question if at least helium and heavier nuclei can be reconciled.
To address this issue, we performed a joint analysis using the AMS-02 CR
measurements of antiprotons, protons, helium, helium 3, boron, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen. We explore two competing propagation scenarios, one with
a break in the diffusion coefficient at a few GVs and no reacceleration, and
another one with reacceleration and with a break in the injection spectra of
primaries. Furthermore, we explicitly consider the impact of the uncertainties
in the nuclear production cross-sections of secondaries by including nuisance
parameters in the fit. The resulting parameter space is explored with the help
of Monte Carlo methods. We find that, contrary to the naive expectation, in the
standard propagation scenarios CR universality is violated also for He, on the
one hand, and C, N, and O, on the other hand, i.e., different injection slopes
(at the level of $ \Delta \sim 0.05$) are required to explain the observed
spectra. As an alternative, we explore further propagation scenarios, inspired
by non-homogeneous diffusion, which might save universality. Finally, we also
investigate the universality of CR propagation, i.e., we compare the
propagation properties inferred using only light nuclei ($\bar{p}$, p, He,
$^3$He) with the ones inferred using only heavier nuclei (B, C, N, O).

introduction to tame geometry and describe how it restricts sets, manifolds,

various effective theories arising from string theory compactifications by
using some recent advances in tame geometry. In particular, we will exploit the
fact that coset spaces and period mappings are definable in an o-minimal

theories and in Calabi-Yau compactifications. As strongest evidence for the
Tameness Conjecture over a discrete parameter space, we then discuss a recent

by strong tidal forces. The stellar debris then evolves into an elongated
stream of gas that partly falls back towards the black hole. We present an
analytical model describing for the first time the full stream evolution during
such a tidal disruption event (TDE). Our framework consists in dividing the
stream into different sections of elliptical geometry, whose properties are
independently evolved in their co-moving frame under the tidal, pressure, and
self-gravity forces. Through an explicit treatment of the tidal force and the
inclusion of the gas angular momentum, we can accurately follow the stream
evolution near pericenter. Our model evolves the longitudinal stream stretching
and both transverse widths simultaneously. For the latter, we identify two
regimes depending on whether the dynamics is entirely dominated by the tidal
force (ballistic regime) or additionally influenced by pressure and
self-gravity (hydrostatic regime). We find that the stream undergoes transverse
collapses both shortly after the stellar disruption and upon its return near
the black hole, at specific locations determined by the regime of evolution
considered. The stream evolution predicted by our model can be used to
determine the subsequent interactions experienced by this gas that are at the

unstable with respect to noise in the data. Solutions of such problems are

data against some predefined function or a solution with a non-parametrical
function using regularization. Here we are focusing on the latter
non-parametric approach applied for the recovery of complex stellar
line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) from the observed galaxy spectra.
Development of such an approach is crucial for galaxies hosting multiple
kinematically misaligned stellar components, such as 2 stellar counter-rotating
disks, thin and thick disks, kinematically decoupled cores, and others.
  Stellar LOSVD recovery from the observed galaxy spectra is equivalent to a
deconvolution and can be solved as a linear inverse problem. To overcome its

quantum East model does not posses analogous slow dynamical properties. In
particular, conversely to the spin case, the bosonic ground state turns out to
be not localized. We restore localization by introducing a repulsive
interaction term. The bosonic nature of the model allows us to construct rich
families of many-body localized states, including coherent, squeezed and cat
states. We formalize this finding by introducing a set of superbosonic
creation-annihilation operators which satisfy the bosonic commutation relations
and, when acting on the vacuum, create excitations exponentially localized
around a certain site of the lattice. Given the constrained nature of the
model, these states retain memory of their initial conditions for long times.
Even in the presence of dissipation, we show that quantum information remains
localized within decoherence times tunable with the parameters of the system.
We propose an implementation of the bosonic quantum East model based on
state-of-the-art superconducting circuits, which could be used in the near

minimally coupled fields and an arbitrary number of non-minimally coupled

includes situations when the dynamics become fully inhomogeneous, fully
non-linear (due to e.g.~backreaction or mode rescattering effects), and/or when
the expansion of the universe is dominated by non-minimally coupled species. As
an example, we study geometric preheating with a non-minimally coupled scalar
spectator field when the inflaton oscillates following the end of inflation. In
the future, our technique may be used to shed light on aspects of the

kinematic wave is misaligned. It appears as a kinematic wave travelling
radially, winding up faster than the density wave matched by the RW,

exchanging a pair of Majoranas twice, repeatedly, at high frequency [1]. In
this process, the exchanged Majorana operators acquire a robust minus sign such
that terms in the Hamiltonian, linear in either operator, vanish on average.
The four protocols proposed implement draiding by coupling quantum dot(s) to

involving first generation of leptons, a singlet vector like fermion

to $a_{e}$ only on top of the usual contribution coming from the

taking into account the bounds from relic density, unitarity and self

$3\rightarrow2$ scatterings while the kinetic equilibrium with the SM bath is
ensured by $2\rightarrow2$ scatterings with neutrinos where $Z_{\mu\tau}$ plays

stellar bars; (2) The SFRs appear higher for larger z_f, in tandem with their
energy and momentum feedback; (3) The stellar kinematics allowed separation of
bulge from the stellar spheroid. The existence of disk-like bulges has been
revealed based on stellar surface density and photometry, but displayed a mixed
disk-like and classical bulges based on their kinematics. The bulge-to-total

potentials, and the $d t$-$\alpha n$ channel-coupling nonlocal tensor potential
are chosen to reproduce the observed low-energy astrophysical $S$-factor of the
reaction $d$+$t\to\alpha$+$n$+17.6 MeV, as well as the total cross section of
the $\alpha$+$n$ reaction. The resultant $dt\mu$ fusion rate is 1.15x10$^{12}$
s$^{-1}$. Substituting the obtained total wave function into the $T$ matrix, we
have calculated absolute values of the fusion rates going to the bound and
continuum states of the outgoing $\alpha$-$\mu$ pair. We then derived the
initial $\alpha$-$\mu$ sticking probability $\omega_S^0$=0.857%, which is
$\sim$7% smaller than the literature values ($\simeq$0.91-0.93%), and can
explain the recent observations (2001) at high D-T densities. We also calculate
the absolute values for the momentum and energy spectra of the emitted muon.
The most important result is that the peak energy is 1.1 keV although the mean
energy is 9.5 keV. This is an essential result for the ongoing experimental

utilizing the $\mu$CF for various applications e.g., a scanning negative muon

high-resolution optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectra of the young red
supergiant (RSG) stars in the Perseus complex, in order to obtain accurate
radial velocities, stellar parameters and detailed chemical abundances.
Methods. We used spectral synthesis to best-fit hundreds of atomic and
molecular lines in the spectra of the observed 27 RSGs. We obtained accurate
estimates of the stellar temperature, gravity, micro and macro turbulence
velocities and chemical abundances for 25 different elements. We also measured
the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C abundance ratio. Results. Our combined optical and NIR
chemical study provides homogeneous half-solar iron with a small dispersion,
about solar-scaled abundance ratios for the iron-peak, alpha and other light
elements and a small enhancement of Na, K and neutron-capture elements,
consistent with the thin disk chemistry traced by older stellar populations at
a similar Galactocentric distance of about 10 kpc. We inferred enhancement of
N, depletion of C and of the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic abundance ratio,
consistent with mixing processes in the stellar interiors during the RSG
evolution.

numerically unresolved problem because of the relevant small scales involved.
One of the uncertainties comes from the simplifications usually assumed in the
initial magnetic topology of merging neutron stars. We perform high-resolution,
convergent large-eddy simulations of binary neutron star mergers, following the
newly formed remnant for up to $30$ milliseconds. Here we specifically focus on
the comparison between simulations with different initial magnetic
configurations, going beyond the widespread-used aligned dipole confined within
each star. The results obtained show that the initial topology is quickly
forgotten, in a timescale of few miliseconds after the merger. Moreover, at the
end of the simulations, the average intensity ($B\sim 10^{16}$ G) and the
spectral distribution of magnetic energy over spatial scales barely depend on
the initial configuration. This is expected due to the small-scale efficient
dynamo involved, and thus it holds as long as: (i) the initial large-scale
magnetic field is not unrealistically high (as often imposed in mergers
studies); (ii) the turbulent instability is numerically (at least partially)
resolved, so that the amplified magnetic energy is distributed across a wide
range of scales and becomes orders-of-magnitude larger than the initial one.

relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations offer a unique opportunity
to unravel the details of the ongoing physical processes. Nevertheless, current
numerical studies are severely limited by the fact that any affordable
resolution remains insufficient to fully capture the small-scale dynamo,
initially triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and later sourced by
several MHD processes involving differential rotation. Here, we alleviate this
limitation by using explicit large-eddy simulations, a technique where the
unresolved dynamics occurring at the sub-grid scales (SGS) is modeled by extra
terms, which are functions of the resolved fields and their derivatives. The
combination of high-order numerical schemes, high resolutions, and the gradient
SGS model allow us to capture the small-scale dynamos produced during the
binary neutron star mergers. Here we follow the first 50 milliseconds after the
merger and, for the first time, we find numerical convergence on the magnetic
field amplification, in terms of integrated energy and spectral distribution
over spatial scales. We also find that the average intensity of the magnetic
field in the remnant saturates at $\sim 10^{16}$~G around $5$~ms after the
merger. After $20-30$~ms, both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field components
grow continuously, fed by the winding mechanism that provides a slow inverse
cascade. We find no clear hints for magneto-rotational instabilities, and no
significant impact of the magnetic field on the redistribution of angular
momentum in the remnant in our simulations, probably due to the very turbulent
and dynamical topology of the magnetic field at all stages, with small-scale

swarm-based optimization is presented for supervision of toothed milling cutter
through characterization of real-time spindle vibrations. The anomalous moments
of vibration evolved due to in-process tool failures (i.e., flank and nose
wear, crater and notch wear, edge fracture) have been investigated through
time-domain response of acceleration and statistical features. The Recursive
Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) with decision trees as the
estimator has been implemented for feature selection. Further, the competence
of standard SVM has been examined for tool health monitoring followed by its
optimization through application of swarm based algorithms. The comparative
analysis of performance of five meta-heuristic algorithms (Elephant Herding
Optimization, Monarch Butterfly Optimization, Harris Hawks Optimization, Slime
Mould Algorithm, and Moth Search Algorithm) has been carried out. The white-box
approach has been presented considering global and local representation that
provides insight into the performance of machine learning models in tool
condition monitoring.

predictions for galaxy clustering and lensing are typically made based on Monte
Carlo realizations of a mock universe. In this paper, we use Subhalo Abundance
Matching (SHAM) as a toy model to introduce an alternative to stochastic
predictions based on mock population, demonstrating how to make
simulation-based predictions for clustering and lensing that are both exact and
differentiable with respect to the parameters of the model. Conventional
implementations of SHAM are based on iterative algorithms such as
Richardson-Lucy deconvolution; here we use the JAX library for automatic
differentiation to train SHAMNet, a neural network that accurately approximates
the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SMHM) defined by abundance matching. In our
approach to making differentiable predictions for large scale structure, we map
parameterized PDFs onto each simulated halo, and calculate gradients of summary
statistics of the galaxy distribution by using autodiff to propagate the
gradients of the SMHM through the statistical estimators used to measure one-
and two-point functions. Our techniques are quite general, and we conclude with
an overview of how they can be applied in tandem with more complex,
higher-dimensional models, creating the capability to make differentiable
predictions for the multi-wavelength universe of galaxies.

properties of dark matter only subhalos from N-body simulations. Our model is
built using the extremely randomized tree (ERT) algorithm and takes subhalo
properties over a wide range of redshifts as its input features. We train our
model using the IllustrisTNG simulations to predict blackhole mass, gas mass,
magnitudes, star formation rate, stellar mass, and metallicity. We compare the
results of our method with a baseline model from previous works, and against a
model that only considers the mass history of the subhalo. We find that our new
model significantly outperforms both of the other models. We then investigate
the predictive power of each input by looking at feature importance scores from
the ERT algorithm. We produce feature importance plots for each baryonic
property, and find that they differ significantly. We identify low redshifts as
being most important for predicting star formation rate and gas mass, with high
redshifts being most important for predicting stellar mass and metallicity, and
consider what this implies for nature vs nurture. We find that the physical
properties of galaxies investigated in this study are all driven by nurture and
not nature. The only property showing a somewhat stronger impact of nature is
the present-day star formation rate of galaxies. Finally we verify that the
feature importance plots are discovering physical patterns, and that the trends
shown are not an artefact of the ERT algorithm.

number eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator (which may also represent a
quantized mode of the electromagnetic radiation). These matrix elements have
first been used by Popov and Perelomov (1969) long ago, in their thorough
analysis of the parametric excitation of harmonic oscillators. They expressed
the matrix elements in terms of transcendental functions, the associated
Legendre functions. In the present paper we will show that these matrix
elements can also be expressed by the classical Gegenbauer polynomials. This
new expression makes it possible to determine coherent and incoherent
superpositions of these matrix elements in closed analytic forms. As an
application, we describe multiphoton transitions in the system ""charged
particle + electromagnetic radiation"", induced by a (strong) coherent field or
by a black-body radiation component (with a Planck-Bose photon number
distribution). The exact results are compared with the semi-classical ones. We
will show that in case of interaction with a thermal field, the semi-classical
result (with a Gaussian stochastic field amplitude) yields an acceptable
approximation only in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit, however, in the Wien limit it
completely fails.

The framework is able to guarantee safety even in the presence of input delay,
by accounting for the evolution of the environment during the delayed response

safety guarantees against prediction errors. The efficacy of the proposed

be time-consuming. Creating a tool for interactively designing prototypes while
observing the wind flow change requires simpler models to simulate faster.
Instead of running numerical approximations resulting in detailed calculations,
data-driven methods and deep learning might be able to give similar results in
a fraction of the time. This work rephrases the problem from computing 3D flow
fields using CFD to a 2D image-to-image translation-based problem on the
building footprints to predict the flow field at pedestrian height level. We
investigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN), such as Pix2Pix
[1] and CycleGAN [2] representing state-of-the-art for image-to-image
translation task in various domains as well as U-Net autoencoder [3]. The
models can learn the underlying distribution of a dataset in a data-driven
manner, which we argue can help the model learn the underlying
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations from CFD. We experiment on
novel simulated datasets on various three-dimensional bluff-shaped buildings
with and without height information. Moreover, we present an extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated images for a selection
of models and compare their performance with the simulations delivered by CFD.
We then show that adding positional data to the input can produce more accurate
results by proposing a general framework for injecting such information on the
different architectures. Furthermore, we show that the models performances
improve by applying attention mechanisms and spectral normalization to
facilitate stable training.

over three epochs of Chandra X-ray observations from 2000, 2006, and 2014. As
the remnant of a historical supernova (observed in 1604 CE), Kepler's SNR
presents the rare opportunity to study the dynamical evolution of such an
object in real time. Measurements of the asymmetry in forward shock velocity
can also provide insight into the nature of the explosion and density of the
circumstellar material. Combining data from 2014 with previous epochs in 2000
and 2006, we can observe the proper motion of filaments along the outer rim of
the SNR. Prior studies of Kepler's SNR have shown proper motion differences up
to a factor of 3 between northern and southern regions around the remnant. With
the longer time baseline we use here, we find results that are consistent with
previous studies, but with smaller uncertainties. Additionally, by adding a
third epoch of observations, we search for any systemic change in the velocity
in the form of a deceleration of the blast wave, as was recently reported in
Tycho's SNR. We find little to no conclusive evidence of such deceleration, and
conclude that Kepler's SNR is encountering circumstellar material that is
roughly constant in density, though substantially varied around the periphery.

is a rapidly growing research topic in quantum machine learning (QML). A key
challenge in using kernels -- both classical and quantum -- is that ML
workflows involve acquiring new observations, for which new kernel values need
to be calculated. Transferring data back-and-forth between where the new
observations are generated & a quantum computer incurs a time delay; this delay
may exceed the timescales relevant for using the QML algorithm in the first
place. In this work, we show quantum kernel matrices can be extended to
incorporate new data using a classical (chordal-graph-based) matrix completion
algorithm. The minimal sample complexity needed for perfect completion is
dependent on matrix rank. We empirically show that (a) quantum kernel matrices
can be completed using this algorithm when the minimal sample complexity is
met, (b) the error of the completion degrades gracefully in the presence of
finite-sampling noise, and (c) the rank of quantum kernel matrices depends
weakly on the expressibility of the quantum feature map generating the kernel.
Further, on a real-world, industrially-relevant data set, the completion error
behaves gracefully even when the minimal sample complexity is not reached.

discussed to gather nanomaterials and devices or unite them into specific
applications, such as nano-electronic gadgets, channel layers, and clinical

environment to maximize its cumulative reward. A standard way to study this
question abstractly is to ask how many samples an agent needs from the
environment to learn an optimal policy for a $\gamma$-discounted Markov
decision process (MDP). For such an MDP, we design quantum algorithms that
approximate an optimal policy ($\pi^*$), the optimal value function ($v^*$),
and the optimal $Q$-function ($q^*$), assuming the algorithms can access
samples from the environment in quantum superposition. This assumption is
justified whenever there exists a simulator for the environment; for example,
if the environment is a video game or some other program. Our quantum
algorithms, inspired by value iteration, achieve quadratic speedups over the
best-possible classical sample complexities in the approximation accuracy
($\epsilon$) and two main parameters of the MDP: the effective time horizon
($\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$) and the size of the action space ($A$). Moreover, we
show that our quantum algorithm for computing $q^*$ is optimal by proving a
matching quantum lower bound.

energy of specific scales associated with coherent structures. Coherent motions
are characterized by the triple decomposition of a multi-scale flow and used to
define mean, coherent, and random kinetic energy. Specific scales of individual
coherent structures are identified through mode decomposition, whereby the
total coherent velocity is separated into a set of velocities classified by the
scale of the mode based on frequency to embed spectral characteristics. The set
of scale-specific coherent velocities are used to identify scale-specific
coherent kinetic energy, which quantifies the kinetic energy of a specific
scale, and an equation for the balance of scale-specific coherent kinetic
energy. Each equation includes terms with velocity triads, which represent the
inter-scale transfer. The methodology is assessed in the wake behind a square
cylinder, where scales of the flow are related to the vortex shedding. The
scale-specific inter-scale transfer identifies that kinetic energy initially in
the near wake is transferred from vortex shedding to scales associated with
higher harmonics of the vortex shedding. In the far wake, inter-scale transfer
is homogeneous and transfer occurs over many frequencies. While the inter-scale
transfer is identified over a range of scales, the scale-specific transport,
convection, and dissipation of coherent kinetic energy are associated with only
the largest, dominant scales. The wake flow is subjected to unsteady inflow at
various frequencies to identify the changes to inter-scale transfer and
coherent kinetic energy induced by other frequencies.

economic inequality through the financial system. A common misconception is
that the environmental sciences are immune to such unintended consequences when
AI is being used, as most data come from observations, and AI algorithms are
based on mathematical formulas, which are often seen as objective. In this
article, we argue the opposite can be the case. Using specific examples, we
demonstrate many ways in which the use of AI can introduce similar consequences
in the environmental sciences. This article will stimulate discussion and
research efforts in this direction. As a community, we should avoid repeating

similarity measure with a classical dynamic programming solution taking
quadratic time. Despite significant efforts, little progress was made in
improving the runtime. Even in the realm of approximation, not much was known
for linear time algorithms beyond the trivial $\sqrt{n}$-approximation. Recent
breakthrough result provided a $n^{0.497}$-factor approximation algorithm
[HSSS19], which was more recently improved to a $n^{0.4}$-factor one [BCD21].
The latter paper also showed a $n^{2-2.5\alpha}$ time algorithm which outputs a
$n^{\alpha}$ approximation to the LCS, but so far no sub-polynomial
approximation is known in truly subquadratic time.
  In this work, we show an algorithm which runs in $O(n)$ time, and outputs a
$n^{o(1)}$-factor approximation to LCS$(x,y)$, with high probability, for any
pair of length $n$ input strings.
  Our entire algorithm is merely an efficient black-box reduction to the
Block-LIS problem, introduced very recently in [ANSS21], and solving the
Block-LIS problem directly.

on the premise that complex events (e.g., minutes) can be decomposed into
simpler events (e.g., a few seconds), and that these simple events are shared

to extract their latent representation with three-dimensional convolutional
neural networks. A clustering method is used to group representations producing
a visual codebook (i.e., a long video is represented by a sequence of integers
given by the cluster labels). A dense representation is learned by encoding the
co-occurrence probability matrix for the codebook entries. We demonstrate how
this representation can leverage the performance of the dense video captioning
task in a scenario with only visual features. As a result of this approach, we
are able to replace the audio signal in the Bi-Modal Transformer (BMT) method
and produce temporal proposals with comparable performance. Furthermore, we
concatenate the visual signal with our descriptor in a vanilla transformer

such that the training process starts from simple samples towards more complex
ones in order to favor convergence and generalization. The concept has been
developed and successfully applied in robotics and control of systems. Here, we
apply this concept for the learning of complex dynamical systems in a
systematic way. First, leveraging insights from the ergodic theory, we assess
the amount of data sufficient for a-priori guaranteeing a faithful model of the
physical system and thoroughly investigate the impact of the training set and
its structure on the quality of long-term predictions. Based on that, we
consider entropy as a metric of complexity of the dataset; we show how an
informed design of the training set based on the analysis of the entropy

which depend on substrate geometry and physical properties. The richness of
positions and orientations of terrain features in the 3-D world gives limbless
animals like snakes that can bend their body versatility to generate forces
from different contact areas for propulsion. Despite many previous studies of
how snakes use lateral body bending for propulsion on relatively flat surfaces
with lateral contact points, little is known about whether and how much snakes
use vertical body bending in combination with lateral bending in 3-D terrain.
This lack had contributed to snake robots being inferior to animals in
stability, efficiency, and versatility when traversing complex 3-D
environments. Here, to begin to elucidate this, we studied how the generalist
corn snake traversed an uneven arena of blocks of random height variation 5
times its body height. The animal traversed the uneven terrain with perfect
stability by propagating 3-D bending down its body with little transverse
motion (11{\deg} slip angle). Although the animal preferred moving through
valleys with higher neighboring blocks, it did not prefer lateral bending.
Among body-terrain contact regions that potentially provide propulsion, 52%
were formed by vertical body bending and 48% by lateral bending. The
combination of vertical and lateral bending may dramatically expand the sources
of propulsive forces available to limbless locomotors by utilizing various
asperities available in 3-D terrain. Direct measurements of contact forces are
necessary to further understand how snakes coordinate 3-D bending along the
entire body via sensory feedback to propel through 3-D terrain. These studies
will open a path to new propulsive mechanisms for snake robots, potentially
increasing the performance and versatility in 3-D terrain.

perturbations when dark energy interacts with dust-like matter, causing the
latter's background energy density fall off with time faster than usual.
Focusing in particular to the late-time cosmic evolution, we show that such an
interaction (of a specific form, arising naturally in a scalar-tensor
formulation, or a wide range of modified gravity equivalents thereof), can have
a rather significant effect on the perturbative spectrum, than on the
background configuration which is not expected to get distorted much from
$\L$CDM. Specifically, the matter density contrast, which is by and large
scale-invariant in the deep sub-horizon limit, not only gets dragged as the
interaction affects the background Hubble expansion rate, but also receives a
contribution from the perturbation in the (scalar field induced) dark energy,
which oscillates about a non-zero mean value. As such, the standard
parametrization ansatz for the the matter density growth factor becomes
inadequate. So we modify it suitably, and also find a numerical fit of the
growth index in terms of the background parameters, in order to alleviate the
problems that arise otherwise. Such a fit enables direct estimations of the
background parameters, as well as the growth parameter and the reduced Hubble
parameter, which we duly carry out using a redshift space distortion (RSD)
subsample and its combination with the observational Hubble data. On the whole,
the parametric estimates show consistency with the general observational
constraints on the background level cosmology, as well as the constraints on
scalar-tensor gravity from astrophysical observations, apart from having
significance in the domain of cosmological perturbations.

different graph and network analysis applications, such as modelling movement

temperature-dependent Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution over paths in the network.
At low temperatures, the distribution focuses solely on the shortest or
least-cost paths, while with increasing temperature, the distribution spreads
over random walks on the network. Many relevant quantities can be computed
conveniently from this distribution, and these often generalize traditional
network measures in a sensible way. However, when modelling real phenomena with
RSPs, one needs a principled way of estimating the parameters from data. In
this work, we develop methods for computing the maximum likelihood estimate of
the model parameters, with focus on the temperature parameter, when modelling
phenomena based on movement, flow, or spreading processes. We test the validity
of the derived methods with trajectories generated on artificial networks as
well as with real data on the movement of wild reindeer in a geographic

animals. These examples demonstrate the attractiveness of the RSP framework as

compute ground states of Bose-Einstein condensates by finding discrete

open. In this paper we shall close this gap by proving optimal order error

discrete minimizers, as well as error estimates for the ground state energy and
the ground state eigenvalue. In particular, the achieved convergence rates for
the energy and the eigenvalue are of $6$th order with respect to the mesh size
on which the discrete LOD space is based, without making any additional

each variable and selects the top few variables. However, this ranking

the propensity score or response model; both vulnerable to model
misspecification. We propose a targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE)

based on a time-domain mapping method by which any infinite-time system can be
corresponded to a prescribed-time system and vice versa. It is shown that the
design of a constrained nonasymptotic prescribed-time controller can be reduced
to the asymptotic control design for an associated constrained infinite-time

constructive representation of the associated infinite-time system. The

to the flexibility of the proposed scheme. It is shown that necessary and

utilities is the anticipated consumption of a customer. Electricity consumption
assessment is difficult to do in settings where a significant fraction of
households do not yet have an electricity connection. In such settings the
absolute levels of anticipated consumption can range from 5-100 kWh/month,
leading to high variability amongst these customers. Precious resources are at
stake if a significant fraction of low consumers are connected over those with
higher consumption.
  This is the first study of it's kind in low-income settings that attempts to
predict a building's consumption and not that of an aggregate administrative
area. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over pre-electrification
daytime satellite imagery with a sample of utility bills from 20,000
geo-referenced electricity customers in Kenya (0.01% of Kenya's residential
customers). This is made possible with a two-stage approach that uses a novel
building segmentation approach to leverage much larger volumes of no-cost
satellite imagery to make the most of scarce and expensive customer data. Our
method shows that competitive accuracies can be achieved at the building level,
addressing the challenge of consumption variability. This work shows that the
building's characteristics and it's surrounding context are both important in
predicting consumption levels. We also evaluate the addition of lower
resolution geospatial datasets into the training process, including nighttime
lights and census-derived data. The results are already helping inform site
selection and distribution-level planning, through granular predictions at the
level of individual structures in Kenya and there is no reason this cannot be
extended to other countries.

between radio power, SFR FUV, and stellar mass we find a lack of correlation
that suggests a combination of origins for the cool gas in these galaxies,
including stellar mass loss, cooling from the intra-group medium (IGrM) or
galaxy halo, and acquisition through mergers or tidal interactions. X-ray
bright systems, in addition to hosting radio powerful AGN, have a range of SFRs

linked to gas mass availability, with star formation favoured in the absence of
a group-scale X-ray halo, but AGN jet launching is more likely in systems with
a cooling IGrM.

Our algorithms reduce the sampling task to computing poly$(n)$ amplitudes of

computation of marginal probabilities. First we consider the case where
$|\psi\rangle=U|0^n\rangle$ is the output state of an $m$-gate quantum circuit

we obtain an efficient classical simulation algorithm for measurement-based
quantum computation with the surface code resource state on any planar graph,
generalizing a previous algorithm which was known to be efficient only under
restrictive topological constraints on the ordering of single-qubit
measurements. Second, we consider the case in which $\psi$ is the unique ground
state of a local Hamiltonian with a spectral gap that is lower bounded by an
inverse polynomial function of $n$. We prove that a simple Metropolis-Hastings
Markov Chain mixes rapidly to the desired probability distribution provided
that $\psi$ obeys a certain technical condition, which we show is satisfied for
all sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This gives a sampling algorithm which

making the surface stress state anisotropic, in contrast to what is expected

determine equilibrium shapes of rotationally symmetric bodies subjected to
anisotropic surface stress states and derive a family of surfaces of revolution

conduct adaptive experiments, in which maximizing reward means that data is
used to progressively assign participants to more effective arms. Such
assignment strategies increase the risk of statistical hypothesis tests
identifying a difference between arms when there is not one, and failing to
conclude there is a difference in arms when there truly is one. We tackle this
by introducing a novel heuristic algorithm, called TS-PostDiff (Posterior
Probability of Difference). TS-PostDiff takes a Bayesian approach to mixing TS
and Uniform Random (UR): the probability a participant is assigned using UR
allocation is the posterior probability that the difference between two arms is
'small' (below a certain threshold), allowing for more UR exploration when
there is little or no reward to be gained. We evaluate TS-PostDiff against
state-of-the-art strategies. The empirical and simulation results help
characterize the trade-offs of these approaches between reward, False Positive
Rate (FPR), and statistical power, as well as under which circumstances each is
effective. We quantify the advantage of TS-PostDiff in performing well across
multiple differences in arm means (effect sizes), showing the benefits of
adaptively changing randomization/exploration in TS in a ""Statistically
Considerate"" manner: reducing FPR and increasing statistical power when
differences are small or zero and there is less reward to be gained, while
exploiting more when differences may be large. This highlights important
considerations for future algorithm development and analysis to better balance
reward and statistical analysis.

In this work, we explore the feasibility of observing the Migdal effect in

existence of a corresponding adiabatic invariant. We develop a discrete-time
analoue of Kruskal's theory. Nearly-periodic maps are defined as
parameter-dependent diffeomorphisms that limit to rotations along a
$U(1)$-action. When the limiting rotation is non-resonant, these maps admit
formal $U(1)$ symmetries to all orders in perturbation theory. For Hamiltonian
nearly-periodic maps on exact presymplectic manifolds, we prove that the formal
$U(1)$ symmetry gives rise to a discrete-time adiabatic invariant using a
discrete-time extension of Noether's theorem. When the unperturbed
$U(1)$-orbits are contractible, we also find a discrete-time adiabatic

As an application of the theory, we use it to develop a novel technique for
geometric integration of non-canonical Hamiltonian systems on exact symplectic

bandwidth and array geometry. Specifically, the waveform bandwidth determines a
point spread function (PSF) that blurs the locations of point scatterers in the

restores the original distribution of scatterers and yields sharper
reconstructions. However, deconvolution is an ill-posed operation that is
highly sensitive to noise. In this work, we leverage implicit neural
representations (INRs), shown to be strong priors for the natural image space,
to deconvolve SAS images. Importantly, our method does not require training
data, as we perform our deconvolution through an analysis-bysynthesis
optimization in a self-supervised fashion. We validate our method on simulated
SAS data created with a point scattering model and real data captured with an
in-air circular SAS. This work is an important first step towards applying

  case study in radiotherapy treatment",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Patient scheduling is a difficult task involving stochastic factors such as
the unknown arrival times of patients. Similarly, the scheduling of
radiotherapy for cancer treatments needs to handle patients with different
urgency levels when allocating resources. High priority patients may arrive at
any time, and there must be resources available to accommodate them. A common
solution is to reserve a flat percentage of treatment capacity for emergency
patients. However, this solution can result in overdue treatments for urgent
patients, a failure to fully exploit treatment capacity, and delayed treatments
for low-priority patients. This problem is especially severe in large and
crowded hospitals. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based approach for
online dynamic radiotherapy scheduling that dynamically adapts the present
scheduling decision based on each incoming patient and the current allocation
of resources. Our approach is based on a regression model trained to recognize
the links between patients' arrival patterns, and their ideal waiting time in
optimal offline solutions where all future arrivals are known in advance. When
our prediction-based approach is compared to flat-reservation policies, it does
a better job of preventing overdue treatments for emergency patients, while
also maintaining comparable waiting times for the other patients. We also
demonstrate how our proposed approach supports explainability and
interpretability in scheduling decisions using SHAP values.

There exist two typical UDA scenarios, i.e., open-set, and open-partial-set,

However, most prior methods are designed for one UDA scenario and always
perform badly on the other UDA scenario. Moreover, they also require the
labeled source data during adaptation, limiting their usability in data
privacy-sensitive applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
Universal Model ADaptation (UMAD) framework which handles both UDA scenarios
without access to the source data nor prior knowledge about the category shift
between domains. Specifically, we aim to learn a source model with an elegantly
designed two-head classifier and provide it to the target domain. During
adaptation, we develop an informative consistency score to help distinguish
unknown samples from known samples. To achieve bilateral adaptation in the
target domain, we further maximize localized mutual information to align known
samples with the source classifier and employ an entropic loss to push unknown
samples far away from the source classification boundary, respectively.
Experiments on open-set and open-partial-set UDA scenarios demonstrate that
UMAD, as a unified approach without access to source data, exhibits comparable,

with a MBH seed population between $3\times 10^4M_{\odot}/h$ and $3\times
10^5M_{\odot}/h$ and a sub-grid dynamical friction (DF) model to follow the MBH
dynamics down to $1.5\;\text{ckpc}/h$. We calculate initial eccentricities of
MBH orbits directly from the simulation at kpc-scales, and find orbital
eccentricities above $0.7$ for most MBH pairs before the numerical merger.
After approximating unresolved evolution on scales below ${\sim
200\,\text{pc}}$, we find that the in-simulation DF on large scales accounts
for more than half of the total orbital decay time ($\sim 500\,\text{Myrs}$)
due to DF. The binary hardening time is an order of magnitude longer than the
DF time, especially for the seed-mass binaries ($M_\text{BH}<2M_\text{seed}$).
As a result, only $\lesssim20\%$ of seed MBH pairs merge at $z>3$ after
considering both unresolved DF evolution and binary hardening. These $z>3$
seed-mass mergers are hosted in a biased population of galaxies with the
highest stellar masses of $>10^9\,M_\odot$. With the higher initial
eccentricity prediction from Astrid, we estimate an expected merger rate of
$0.3-0.7$ per year from the $z>3$ MBH population. This is a factor of $\sim 7$
higher than the prediction using the circular orbit assumption. The LISA events
are expected at a similar rate, and comprise $\gtrsim 60\%$ seed-seed mergers,
$\sim 30\%$ involving only one seed-mass MBH, and $\sim 10\%$ mergers of
non-seed MBHs.

facilitate their use, we develop a query rewriting model CONQRR that rewrites a
conversational question in the context into a standalone question. It is
trained with a novel reward function to directly optimize towards retrieval
using reinforcement learning and can be adapted to any off-the-shelf retriever.
CONQRR achieves state-of-the-art results on a recent open-domain CQA dataset
containing conversations from three different sources, and is effective for two

robustness of CONQRR to out-of-domain dialogues as well as to zero query

Transformer encoders used in NLP tasks process the hidden states of all input

other tasks such as sequence classification, answering the raised question does
not necessarily need all the tokens in the context paragraph. Following this
motivation, we propose Block-skim, which learns to skim unnecessary context in
higher hidden layers to improve and accelerate the Transformer performance. The
key idea of Block-Skim is to identify the context that must be further
processed and those that could be safely discarded early on during inference.
Critically, we find that such information could be sufficiently derived from
the self-attention weights inside the Transformer model. We further prune the
hidden states corresponding to the unnecessary positions early in lower layers,
achieving significant inference-time speedup. To our surprise, we observe that
models pruned in this way outperform their full-size counterparts. Block-Skim
improves QA models' accuracy on different datasets and achieves 3 times speedup

repositioning. In recent years, the accumulation of a large number of genomics
and pharmacology data has formed mass drug and target related heterogeneous
networks (HNs), which provides new opportunities of developing HN-based
computational models to accurately predict DTIs. The HN implies lots of useful
information about DTIs but also contains irrelevant data, and how to make the
best of heterogeneous networks remains a challenge. Results: In this paper, we
propose a heterogeneous graph automatic meta-path learning based DTI prediction
method (HampDTI). HampDTI automatically learns the important meta-paths between
drugs and targets from the HN, and generates meta-path graphs. For each
meta-path graph, the features learned from drug molecule graphs and target
protein sequences serve as the node attributes, and then a node-type specific
graph convolutional network (NSGCN) which efficiently considers node type
information (drugs or targets) is designed to learn embeddings of drugs and
targets. Finally, the embeddings from multiple meta-path graphs are combined to
predict novel DTIs. The experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
proposed HampDTI achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art
DTI prediction methods. More importantly, HampDTI identifies the important
meta-paths for DTI prediction, which could explain how drugs connect with
targets in HNs.

discontinuities for the ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in
Sobolev spaces, which are most typical interfacial waves for astrophysical
plasmas and prototypical fundamental waves for hyperbolic systems of
conservation laws. Such waves are characteristic discontinuities for which
there is no flow across the discontinuity surface while the magnetic field
crosses transversely, which lead to a two-phase free boundary problem where the
pressure, velocity and magnetic field are continuous across the interface
whereas the entropy and density may have jumps. To overcome the difficulties of
possible nonlinear Rayleigh--Taylor instability and loss of derivatives, here
we use crucially the Lagrangian formulation and Cauchy's celebrated integral
(1815) for the magnetic field. These motivate us to define two special good
unknowns; one enables us to capture the boundary regularizing effect of the
transversal magnetic field on the flow map, and the other one allows us to get
around the troublesome boundary integrals due to the transversality of the

we show that mathematical runtime analyses are feasible also for the NSGA-II.
As particular results, we prove that with a population size four times larger
than the size of the Pareto front, the NSGA-II with two classic mutation
operators and four different ways to select the parents satisfies the same
asymptotic runtime guarantees as the SEMO and GSEMO algorithms on the basic
OneMinMax and LeadingOnesTrailingZeros benchmarks. However, if the population

efficiently compute the full Pareto front: For an exponential number of
iterations, the population will always miss a constant fraction of the Pareto
front. Our experiments confirm the above findings.

(KGEs) embedding entities and relations of a KG into continuous vector spaces,
have been proposed for these reasoning tasks and proven to be efficient and
robust. But the plausibility and feasibility of applying and deploying KGEs in
real-work applications has not been well-explored. In this paper, we discuss

prediction to help both users and business operators understand why the
prediction is made; 3) transferable rules, generating reusable rules to
accelerate the deployment of a KG to new systems. While non existing KGE could
meet all these desiderata, we propose a novel one, an explainable knowledge
graph attention network that make prediction through modeling correlations
between triples rather than purely relying on its head entity, relation and
tail entity embeddings. It could automatically selects attentive triples for
prediction and records the contribution of them at the same time, from which
explanations could be easily provided and transferable rules could be
efficiently produced. We empirically show that our method is capable of meeting

two issues - third-party authentication and application mobility - for
continuous service during roaming without re-authentication. In this work, we
propose a Federated State transfer and 3rd-party Authentication (FS3A)
mechanism that uses a transparent proxy to transfer the information of both
authentication and application state across operators to resolve these issues.
The FS3A proxy is kept transparent, with virtual counterparts, to avoid any
changes to the existing MEC and cellular architectures. FS3A provides users
with a token, when authenticated by an MEC, which can be reused across
operators for faster authentication. Prefetching of subscription and state is
also proposed to further reduce the authentication and application mobility
latencies. We evaluated FS3A on an OpenAirInterface (OAI)-based testbed and the
results show that token reuse and subscription prefetching reduce the
authentication latency by 53-65%, compared to complete re-authentication, while
state prefetching reduces application mobility latency by 51-91%, compared to
no prefetching. Overall, FS3A reduces the service interruption time by 33%,

characteristics of the side-coupled double quantum-impurity system based on the
hierarchical equations of motion. It is found that the transport current
behaves like a single quantum dot when the coupling strength is low during
tunneling or coulomb coupling. The dynamic current oscillates due to the
temporal coherence of the electron tunneling device only when the tunneling
transition is coupled. The oscillation frequency of the transport current is
related to the step voltage applied by the lead, while the $T$, e-e interaction
$U$ and the bandwidth $W$ have little influence. The amplitude of the current
oscillation exists in positive correlation with $W$ and negative correlation
with $U$. With the increase in coupling $t_{12}$ between impurities, the ground
state of the system changes from a Kondo singlet of one impurity to a
spin-singlet of two impurities. Moreover, lowering the temperature could
promote the Kondo effect to intensify the oscillation of the dynamic current.
When only the coulomb transition is coupled, it is found that the two split-off
Hubbard peaks move upward and have different interference effects on the Kondo
peak at the Fermi surface with the increase in $U_{12}$, from the dynamics
point of view.

leverages an IE's contextual information and definition and does not require a

spontaneously, which can involve charge, spin, and valley degree of freedoms.
Here, we report an observation of new correlated insulators evolved from spin
polarized states to valley polarized states in AB-BA stacked twisted double
bilayer graphene (TDBG). The transition of the isospin polarization is a result
of the competition between spin and valley, driven by the displacement field
(D). At a high field |D| > 0.7 V/nm, we observe valley polarized correlated
insulators with a big Zeeman g factor of ~10, both at v = 2 in the moir\'e
conduction band and more surprisingly at v = -2 in the moir\'e valence band. At
a medium field |D| < 0.6 V/nm, by contrast, it is a conventional spin polarized
correlated insulator at v = 2 and a featureless metal at v = -2. Moreover, we
observe a valley polarized Chern insulator with C = 2 emanating at v = 2 in the
electron side and a valley polarized Fermi surface around v = -2 in the hole
side. The valley Chern insulator with C = 2 is evident from a well quantized
Hall conductance plateau at 2e^2/h and correspondingly a vanishing longitudinal
component. The valley polarized Fermi surface is topologically trivial with C =
0, and it shows a series of quantized Landau levels with v_LL = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
and others. These observations are in good agreements with our band and
topology calculations. Our results demonstrate a feasible way to realize
isospin control and to obtain new phases of matter in TDBG by the displacement
field, and might benefit other twisted or non-twisted multilayer systems.

Previous works in this regime are mainly based on applying various GARCH-type

works for general cases and such traditional methods are unstable for dealing
with high-volatile period or using small sample size. The newly proposed
normalizing and variance stabilizing (NoVaS) method is a more robust and
accurate prediction technique. This Model-free method is built by taking
advantage of an inverse transformation which is based on the ARCH model.
Inspired by the historic development of the ARCH to GARCH model, we propose a
novel NoVaS-type method which exploits the GARCH model structure. By performing
extensive data analysis, we find our model has better time-aggregated
prediction performance than the current state-of-the-art NoVaS method on
forecasting short and volatile data. The victory of our new method corroborates
that and also opens up avenues where one can explore other NoVaS structures to
improve on the existing ones or solve specific prediction problems.

enormous interesting owing to their significant impact on the fundamental

microscopic mechanisms of STS are still controversial. Herein, we study the
corrections of the binding energies of the IXs due to the exciton-interface
optical phonon coupling in four kinds of vdWHs and find that these IXs are in
the STS for the appropriate ratio of the electron and hole effective masses. We
show that these STSs could be classified into the type I with the increasing
binding energy in the tens of meV range, which are very agreement with the
red-shift of the IXs spectra in experiments, and the type II with the
decreasing binding energy, which provides a possible explanation for the
blue-shift and broad linewidth of the IXs spectra in the low temperature.
Moreover, these two types of self-trapped IXs could be transformed into each
other by adjusting the structural parameters of vdWHs. These results not only
provide an in-depth understanding for the self-trapped mechanism of IX, but
also shed light on the modulations of IXs in vdWHs.

the customized answers are built with the user's persona and Wikipedia

whether the model reflects adequate persona and knowledge with our proposed two

single-layer RACs possess a maximum information propagation capacity, reflected
by the saturation of the EE. Enlarging the bond dimension beyond the EE
saturation threshold does not increase model prediction accuracies, so a
minimal model that best estimates the data statistics can be inferred. Although
the saturated EE is smaller than the maximum EE allowed by the area law, our
minimal model still achieves ~99% training accuracies in realistic sentiment

single-layer RACs for NLP. Contrary to a common belief that long-range
information propagation is the main source of RNNs' successes, we show that
single-layer RACs harness high expressiveness from the subtle interplay between
the information propagation and the word vector embeddings. Our work sheds

inverts single-dimensional latent space (LS) features of the seismic data for
retrieving the subsurface background velocity model. The single-dimensional LS
features mainly contain the kinematic information of the seismic data, which
are automatically extracted from the seismic signal by using an autoencoder
network. Because its LS feature dimension is too small to preserve the dynamic
information, such as the waveform variations, of the seismic data. Therefore
the NML inversion is not able to recover the high-wavenumber velocity details.
To mitigate this problem, we propose to invert multi-dimensional LS features,
which can fully represent the entire characters of the seismic data. We denote
this method as multi-dimensional Newtonian machine learning (MNML). In MNML, we
define a new multi-variable connective function that works together with the
multi-variable implicit function theorem to connect the velocity perturbations
to the multi-dimensional LS feature perturbations. Numerical tests show that
(1) the multi-dimensional LS features can preserve more data information than
the single-dimensional LS features; (2) a higher resolution velocity model can
be recovered by inverting the multi-dimensional LS features, and the inversion
quality is comparable to that of FWI; (3) the MNML method requires a much
smaller storage space than conventional FWI because only the low-dimensional
representations of the high-dimensional seismic data are needed to be stored.
The disadvantage of MNML is that it can more easily get stuck in local minima
compared to the NML method. So we suggest a multiscale inversion approach that
inverts for higher dimensional LS features as the iteration count increase.

graph simulation to compactly encode the query answer search space. The index
can be built on-the-fly during query execution and does not have to be
persisted to disk. Using the index, we design a multi-way join algorithm to
enumerate query solutions without generating any potentially exploding
intermediate results. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our
approach can efficiently evaluate a wide range / broad spectrum of graph
pattern queries and greatly outperforms existing approaches and recent graph
query engines/systems.

diagonalization based methods become increasingly expensive as temperature
increases due to the need to compute increasing numbers of partially occupied
states. We present a density matrix based method for Kohn-Sham calculations at
high temperature that eliminates the need for diagonalization entirely, thus
reducing the cost of such calculations significantly. Specifically, we develop
real-space expressions for the electron density, electronic free energy,
Hellmann-Feynman forces, and Hellmann-Feynman stress tensor in terms of an
orthonormal auxiliary orbital basis and its density kernel transform, the
density kernel being the matrix representation of the density operator in the
auxiliary basis. Using Chebyshev filtering to generate the auxiliary basis, we
next develop an approach akin to Clenshaw-Curtis spectral quadrature to
calculate the individual columns of the density kernel based on the Fermi
operator expansion in Chebyshev polynomials; and employ a similar approach to
evaluate band structure and entropic energy components. We implement the
proposed formulation in the SPARC electronic structure code, using which we
show systematic convergence of the aforementioned quantities to exact
diagonalization results, and obtain significant speedups relative to
conventional diagonalization based methods. Finally, we employ the new method
to compute the self-diffusion coefficient and viscosity of aluminum at 116,045
K from Kohn-Sham quantum molecular dynamics, where we find agreement with
previous more approximate orbital-free density functional methods.

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2112.01683",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-shot learning (ZSL) tackles the novel class recognition problem by
transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones. Existing
attention-based models have struggled to learn inferior region features in a
single image by solely using unidirectional attention, which ignore the
transferability and discriminative attribute localization of visual features.
In this paper, we propose a cross attribute-guided Transformer network, termed
TransZero++, to refine visual features and learn accurate attribute
localization for semantic-augmented visual embedding representations in ZSL.
TransZero++ consists of an attribute$\rightarrow$visual Transformer sub-net
(AVT) and a visual$\rightarrow$attribute Transformer sub-net (VAT).
Specifically, AVT first takes a feature augmentation encoder to alleviate the
cross-dataset problem, and improves the transferability of visual features by
reducing the entangled relative geometry relationships among region features.
Then, an attribute$\rightarrow$visual decoder is employed to localize the image
regions most relevant to each attribute in a given image for attribute-based
visual feature representations. Analogously, VAT uses the similar feature
augmentation encoder to refine the visual features, which are further applied
in visual$\rightarrow$attribute decoder to learn visual-based attribute
features. By further introducing semantical collaborative losses, the two
attribute-guided transformers teach each other to learn semantic-augmented
visual embeddings via semantical collaborative learning. Extensive experiments
show that TransZero++ achieves the new state-of-the-art results on three

in super resolution (SR) methods using deep learning allow the digital
enhancement of low resolution (LR) images over large spatial scales, creating
SR images comparable to the high resolution (HR) ground truth. This circumvents
traditional resolution and field-of-view trade-offs. An outstanding issue is
the use of paired (registered) LR and HR data, which is often required in the
training step of such methods but is difficult to obtain. In this work, we
rigorously compare two different state-of-the-art SR deep learning techniques,
using both paired and unpaired data, with like-for-like ground truth data. The
first approach requires paired images to train a convolutional neural network
(CNN) while the second approach uses unpaired images to train a generative
adversarial network (GAN). The two approaches are compared using a micro-CT
carbonate rock sample with complicated micro-porous textures. We implemented
various image based and numerical verifications and experimental validation to
quantitatively evaluate the physical accuracy and sensitivities of the two
methods. Our quantitative results show that unpaired GAN approach can
reconstruct super-resolution images as precise as paired CNN method, with
comparable training times and dataset requirement. This unlocks new
applications for micro-CT image enhancement using unpaired deep learning
methods; image registration is no longer needed during the data processing

a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP), which is difficult to solve

reduces the search space, therefore, as a natural consequence, significantly
reduces the computational burden. In literatures, many tightened formulations
for a single unit with parts of constraints were reported without presenting
explicitly how they were derived. In this paper, a systematic approach is
developed to formulate tight formulations. The idea is to use more binary
variables to represent the state of the unit so as to obtain the tightest upper
bound of power generation limits and ramping constraints for a single unit. In
this way, we propose a multi-period formulation based on sliding windows which
may have different sizes for each unit in the system. Furthermore, a
multi-period model taking historical status into consideration is obtained.
Besides, sufficient and necessary conditions for the facets of single-unit
constraints polytope are provided and redundant inequalities are eliminated.
The proposed models and three other state-of-the-art models are tested on 73

Experimental results on four public EZ-XMC datasets demonstrate that MACLR
achieves superior performance compared to all other leading baseline methods,

average. Moreover, we also show that our pre-trained encoder can be further
improved on FS-XMC when there are a limited number of ground-truth positive

we train a new model, DREAM, to answer questions that elaborate the scenes that

adding focused elaborations about a situation can improve a system's reasoning

quality of the machine-generated conversations, however, some of the generated
responses still suffer from excessive repetition, sometimes repeating words
from utterance, sometimes repeating words within self-generated responses, or
both. Inappropriate repetition of words can significantly degrade the quality
of the generated texts. Penalized sampling is one popular solution, reducing
the sampling probability of existing words during inference, however, it is
highly vulnerable to the inappropriate setting of the static weight. Setting it
too high can yield strange and unrealistic sentences while setting it too low
makes the task of suppressing repetition trivial. To remedy the shortcomings of
the above methods, we design a context-aware classifier to explicitly decide
when to allow repetition and when to employ penalized sampling. Such a
classifier can be easily integrated with existing decoding methods, reducing
repetitions where appropriate while preserving the diversity of the text.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate higher quality
and more authentic dialogues.

password-based authentication offering better usability and security. In this
work, we revisit the biometric authentication based on ""fuzzy signatures""
introduced by Takahashi et al. (ACNS'15, IJIS'19). These are special types of
digital signatures where the secret signing key can be a ""fuzzy"" data such as
user's biometrics. Compared to other cryptographically secure biometric
authentications as those relying on fuzzy extractors, the fuzzy signature-based
scheme provides a more attractive security guarantee. However, despite their
potential values, fuzzy signatures have not attracted much attention owing to
their theory-oriented presentations in all prior works. For instance, the
discussion on the practical feasibility of the assumptions (such as the entropy
of user biometrics), which the security of fuzzy signatures hinges on, is
completely missing.
  In this work, we revisit fuzzy signatures and show that we can indeed
efficiently and securely implement them in practice. At a high level, our
contribution is threefold: (i) we provide a much simpler, more efficient, and
direct construction of fuzzy signature compared to prior works; (ii) we
establish novel statistical techniques to experimentally evaluate the
conditions on biometrics that are required to securely instantiate fuzzy
signatures; and (iii) we provide experimental results using a real-world
finger-vein dataset to show that finger-veins from a single hand are sufficient
to construct efficient and secure fuzzy signatures.
  Our performance analysis shows that in a practical scenario with 112-bits of
security, the size of the signature is 1256 bytes, and the running time for
signing/verification is only a few milliseconds.

Amazon pages, with 3 million attribute-value annotations across 1257 unique
categories. MAVE has four main and unique advantages: First, MAVE is the
largest product attribute value extraction dataset by the number of
attribute-value examples. Second, MAVE includes multi-source representations
from the product, which captures the full product information with high
attribute coverage. Third, MAVE represents a more diverse set of attributes and

challenging zero-shot test set, as we empirically illustrate in the
experiments. We further propose a novel approach that effectively extracts the

$L_{0}$, $L_{+}$ and $L_{-}$. As for $L_{0}$, the spin polarizations are
opposite at $\textbf{K}$ and $\textbf{K}^{\prime}$ valley and the total
magnetization is zero. $L_{\pm}$ describe two degenerate spin-polarized states,
and the directions of polarization are opposite for the states of $L_{+}$ and

polarized in domains in which their particular states can be randomly described

for a nonzero $\mathbf{B}$. We estimate the size of domains as several

potential. This has been done by using the phase space coordinates
transformation based on 2-parameter family of unitarily equivalent irreducible
representations of the nilpotent Lie group $G_{NC}$. We find that the energy
levels and states of the system are unique and hence, same goes to the
degeneracies as well since they are heavily reliant on the applied $B$ and the
noncommutativity $\theta $ of coordinates. Without $B$, we essentially have a
noncommutative planar harmonic oscillator under generalized Bopp shift or
Seiberg-Witten map. The degenerate energy levels can always be found if
$\theta$ is proportional to the ratio between $\hbar$ and $m\omega$. For the
scale $B\theta = \hbar$, the spectrum of energy is isomorphic to Landau problem
in symmetric gauge and hence, each energy level is infinitely degenerate
regardless of any values of $\theta$. Finally, if $0 < B\theta < \hbar$,
$\theta$ has to also be proportional to the ratio between $\hbar$ and $m\omega$
for the degeneracy to occur. These proportionality parameters are evaluated and
if they are not satisfied then we will have non-degenerate energy levels.
Finally, the probability densities and effects of $B$ and $\theta$ on the
system are properly shown for all cases.

critical values, $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$, penetrating magnetic flux forms a
lattice of vortices whose motion can induce dissipation. Consequently, the
magnetization $M$ of superconductors is typically progressively weakened with
increasing magnetic field $B \propto n_v$ (for vortex density $n_v$). However,
some materials exhibit a non-monotonic $M(B)$, presenting a maximum in $M$ at
what is known as the second magnetization peak. This phenomenon appears in most
classes of superconductors, including low $T_c$ materials, iron-based, and
cuprates, complicating pinpointing its origin and garnering intense interest.
Here, we report on vortex dynamics in optimally doped and overdoped
HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+x}$ crystals, with a focus on a regime in which plastic
deformations of the vortex lattice govern magnetic properties. Specifically, we
find that both crystals exhibit conspicuous second magnetization peaks and,
from measurements of the field- and temperature- dependent vortex creep rates,
identify and characterize phase boundaries between elastic and plastic vortex
dynamics, as well as multiple previously unreported transitions within the
plastic flow regime. We find that the second magnetization peak coincides with
the elastic-to-plastic crossover for a very small range of high fields, and a
sharp crossover within the plastic flow regime for a wider range of lower
fields. We find evidence that this transition in the plastic flow regime is due
to a dimensional crossover, specifically a transition from 3D to 2D plastic
dynamics.

  Recommendation","10 pages. To Appear in SIGIR'22",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Contrastive learning (CL) recently has spurred a fruitful line of research in
the field of recommendation, since its ability to extract self-supervised
signals from the raw data is well-aligned with recommender systems' needs for
tackling the data sparsity issue. A typical pipeline of CL-based recommendation
models is first augmenting the user-item bipartite graph with structure
perturbations, and then maximizing the node representation consistency between
different graph augmentations. Although this paradigm turns out to be
effective, what underlies the performance gains is still a mystery. In this
paper, we first experimentally disclose that, in CL-based recommendation
models, CL operates by learning more evenly distributed user/item
representations that can implicitly mitigate the popularity bias. Meanwhile, we
reveal that the graph augmentations, which were considered necessary, just play
a trivial role. Based on this finding, we propose a simple CL method which
discards the graph augmentations and instead adds uniform noises to the
embedding space for creating contrastive views. A comprehensive experimental
study on three benchmark datasets demonstrates that, though it appears
strikingly simple, the proposed method can smoothly adjust the uniformity of
learned representations and has distinct advantages over its graph
augmentation-based counterparts in terms of recommendation accuracy and
training efficiency. The code is released at https://github.com/Coder-Yu/QRec.

unseen domains without access to the target domain data at training time, which
is a realistic but challenging problem. In contrast to methods assuming an
identical model for different domains, Mixture of Experts (MoE) exploits
multiple domain-specific networks for leveraging complementary information
between domains, obtaining impressive results. However, prior MoE-based DG ReID
methods suffer from a large model size with the increase of the number of
source domains, and most of them overlook the exploitation of domain-invariant
characteristics. To handle the two issues above, this paper presents a new
approach called Mimic Embedding via adapTive Aggregation (META) for DG person
ReID. To avoid the large model size, experts in META do not adopt a branch
network for each source domain but share all the parameters except for the
batch normalization layers. Besides multiple experts, META leverages Instance
Normalization (IN) and introduces it into a global branch to pursue invariant
features across domains. Meanwhile, META considers the relevance of an unseen
target sample and source domains via normalization statistics and develops an
aggregation module to adaptively integrate multiple experts for mimicking
unseen target domain. Benefiting from a proposed consistency loss and an
episodic training algorithm, META is expected to mimic embedding for a truly
unseen target domain. Extensive experiments verify that META surpasses
state-of-the-art DG person ReID methods by a large margin. Our code is

quickly identifying similarities between genomic sequences by matching seeds
with a single lookup of their hash values. However, these hash values can be
used only for finding exact-matching seeds as the conventional hashing methods
assign distinct hash values for different seeds, including highly similar
seeds. Finding only exact-matching seeds causes either 1) increasing the use of
the costly sequence alignment or 2) limited sensitivity.
  We introduce BLEND, the first efficient and accurate mechanism that can
identify both exact-matching and highly similar seeds with a single lookup of
their hash values, called fuzzy seed matches. BLEND 1) utilizes a technique
called SimHash, that can generate the same hash value for similar sets, and 2)
provides the proper mechanisms for using seeds as sets with the SimHash
technique to find fuzzy seed matches efficiently.
  We show the benefits of BLEND when used in read overlapping and read mapping.
For read overlapping, BLEND is faster by 2.4x - 83.9x (on average 19.3x), has a
lower memory footprint by 0.9x - 14.1x (on average 3.8x), and finds higher
quality overlaps leading to accurate de novo assemblies than the
state-of-the-art tool, minimap2. For read mapping, BLEND is faster by 0.8x -

canonical utterances as they are closer to the natural language used for
pre-training. Recently, models also pre-trained on code, like OpenAI Codex,

test this hypothesis and find that Codex performs better on such tasks than

unlike GPT-3, Codex performs similarly when targeting meaning representations
directly, perhaps because meaning representations are structured similar to

ubiquitous in chemical, ecological, climate, or neural systems. Despite their
importance, general mechanisms for their emergence are little understood. In
order to fill this gap, we present a framework for describing the emergence of
recurrent synchronization in complex networks with adaptive interactions. This
phenomenon is manifested at the macroscopic level by temporal episodes of
coherent and incoherent dynamics that alternate recurrently. At the same time,
the dynamics of the individual nodes do not change qualitatively. We identify
asymmetric adaptation rules and temporal separation between the adaptation and
the dynamics of individual nodes as key features for the emergence of recurrent

fundamental ingredient for recurrent synchronization phenomena as seen in
pattern generators, e.g., in neuronal systems.

a versatile class of discriminative clustering methods. The classification
probabilities are usually defined through the use of some classical losses from
supervised classification and the point is to avoid modelisation of the full
data distribution by just optimizing the law of the labels conditioned on the
observations. We give the first theoretical study of such methods, by
specializing to logistic classification probabilities. We prove that if the
observations are generated from a two-component isotropic Gaussian mixture,
then minimizing the entropy risk over a Euclidean ball indeed allows to
identify the separation vector of the mixture. Furthermore, if this separation
vector is sparse, then penalizing the empirical risk by a
$\ell_{1}$-regularization term allows to infer the separation in a
high-dimensional space and to recover its support, at standard rates of
sparsity problems. Our approach is based on the local convexity of the logistic
entropy risk, that occurs if the separation vector is large enough, with a
condition on its norm that is independent from the space dimension. This local
convexity property also guarantees fast rates in a classical, low-dimensional
setting.

that enables agents to learn to dynamically share reward with neighbors so as
to encourage agents to cooperate on the global objective through collectives.
For each agent, the high-level policy learns how to share reward with neighbors
to decompose the global objective, while the low-level policy learns to
optimize the local objective induced by the high-level policies in the
neighborhood. The two policies form a bi-level optimization and learn
alternately. We empirically demonstrate that LToS outperforms existing methods

as production planning, material resource planning and budgeting in the supply
chain. Promotions are one of the most important business strategies that are
often used to boost sales. While promotions are attractive for generating
demand, it is often difficult to forecast demand in their presence. In the past
few decades, several quantitative models have been developed to forecast sales
including statistical and machine learning models. However, these methods may
not be adequate to account for all the internal and external factors that may
impact sales. As a result, qualitative models have been adopted along with
quantitative methods as consulting experts has been proven to improve forecast
accuracy by providing contextual information. Such models are being used
extensively to account for factors that can lead to a rapid change in sales,
such as during promotions. In this paper, we aim to use Bayesian Networks to
forecast promotional sales where a combination of factors such as price, type
of promotions, and product location impacts sales. We choose to develop a BN
model because BN models essentially have the capability to combine various
qualitative and quantitative factors with causal forms, making it an attractive
tool for sales forecasting during promotions. This can be used to adjust a
company's promotional strategy in the context of this case study. We gather
sales data for a particular product from a retailer that sells products in
Australia. We develop a Bayesian Network for this product and validate our
results by empirical analysis. This paper confirms that BNs can be effectively
used to forecast sales, especially during promotions. In the end, we provide
some research avenues for using BNs in forecasting sales.

We previously fit the traditional radio pulsar rotating vector model to the
linearly polarised optical data from this source, constraining the system
geometry as well as the white dwarf mass. Using a much more extensive dataset,
we now explore the application of the same model to binary phase-resolved
optical polarimetric data, thought to be the result of non-thermal synchrotron
radiation, and derive the magnetic inclination angle $\alpha$ and the observer
angle $\zeta$ at different orbital phases. We obtain a $\sim 10^{\circ}$
variation in $\alpha$ and $\sim 30^{\circ}$ variation in $\zeta$ over the
orbital period. The variation patterns in these two parameters is robust,
regardless of the binning and epoch of data used. We speculate that the
observer is detecting radiation from an asymmetric emission region that is a
stable structure over several orbital periods. The success of this simple model
lastly implies that the pitch angles of the particles are small and the pulsed,
non-thermal emission originates relatively close to the white dwarf surface.

Unlike the observations in previous works, we find that MAPbI3 degradation
starts at surface defects and progressing from the surface defects towards
neighboring regions under high charge carrier density condition. By using PbI2
passivation, the defect-initiated degradation is significantly suppressed and
the nanoplatelet degrades in a layer-by-layer way, enabling the MAPbI3 laser
sustain for 4500 s (2.7*10^7 pulses), which is almost 3 times longer than that
of the nanoplatelet laser without passivation. Meanwhile, the PbI2 passivated
MAPbI3 nanoplatelet laser with the nanoplatelet cavity displaying a maximum

to a topology change in the D6-brane embeddings whose dual interpretation is

  for Sequential Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sequential recommendation based on multi-interest framework models the user's
recent interaction sequence into multiple different interest vectors, since a
single low-dimensional vector cannot fully represent the diversity of user
interests. However, most existing models only intercept users' recent
interaction behaviors as training data, discarding a large amount of historical
interaction sequences. This may raise two issues. On the one hand, data
reflecting multiple interests of users is missing; on the other hand, the
co-occurrence between items in historical user-item interactions is not fully
explored. To tackle the two issues, this paper proposes a novel sequential
recommendation model called ""Global Interaction Aware Multi-Interest Framework
for Sequential Recommendation (GIMIRec)"". Specifically, a global context
extraction module is firstly proposed without introducing any external
information, which calculates a weighted co-occurrence matrix based on the
constrained co-occurrence number of each item pair and their time interval from
the historical interaction sequences of all users and then obtains the global
context embedding of each item by using a simplified graph convolution.
Secondly, the time interval of each item pair in the recent interaction
sequence of each user is captured and combined with the global context item
embedding to get the personalized item embedding. Finally, a self-attention
based multi-interest framework is applied to learn the diverse interests of
users for sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments on the three
real-world datasets of Amazon-Books, Taobao-Buy and Amazon-Hybrid show that the
performance of GIMIRec on the Recall, NDCG and Hit Rate indicators is
significantly superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the
proposed global context extraction module can be easily transplanted to most
sequential recommendation models.

2^\circ$ ($2.6\,\mathrm{Mpc} \times 2.6\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) of Perseus based on the
presence of one-sided radio continuum tails that were detected at
$144\,\mathrm{MHz}$ by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). The observed radio
tails, as well as the orientation of morphological features in the rest-frame
optical, are consistent with these four galaxies being impacted by ram pressure
stripping as they orbit through the Perseus intracluster medium. By combining
the LOFAR imaging at 144 MHz with 344 MHz imaging from the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array, we derived spectral indices for the disks and the stripped tails
of these jellyfish galaxies. We show that the spectral indices over the galaxy
disks are quite flat, while the indices of the stripped tails are substantially
steeper. We also identified a number of compact $\mathrm{H\alpha + [NII]}$
sources with narrowband imaging from the Isaac Newton Telescope. These sources
are brighter along the leading side of the galaxy (i.e., opposite to the
direction of the stripped tail), which is consistent with ram pressure induced
star formation. Lastly, consistent with previous works in other clusters, we
find that these jellyfish galaxies show enhanced radio luminosities for their
observed star formation rates. Given the small distance to the Perseus cluster
($D \sim 70\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, $1'' \simeq 340\,\mathrm{pc}$), these galaxies are
excellent candidates for multiwavelength follow-up observations to probe the

to its independence from labels and its robustness in representation. Current
studies on this topic mainly use static information such as graph structures
but cannot well capture dynamic information such as timestamps of edges.
Realistic graphs are often dynamic, which means the interaction between nodes
occurs at a specific time. This paper proposes a self-supervised dynamic graph
representation learning framework (DySubC), which defines a temporal subgraph
contrastive learning task to simultaneously learn the structural and
evolutional features of a dynamic graph. Specifically, a novel temporal
subgraph sampling strategy is firstly proposed, which takes each node of the
dynamic graph as the central node and uses both neighborhood structures and
edge timestamps to sample the corresponding temporal subgraph. The subgraph
representation function is then designed according to the influence of
neighborhood nodes on the central node after encoding the nodes in each
subgraph. Finally, the structural and temporal contrastive loss are defined to
maximize the mutual information between node representation and temporal
subgraph representation. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate
that (1) DySubC performs better than the related baselines including two graph
contrastive learning models and four dynamic graph representation learning
models in the downstream link prediction task, and (2) the use of temporal
information can not only sample more effective subgraphs, but also learn better

explicitly modelling the semantic changes by adding each turn and the
summarization of the whole context can bring better performance on converting
conversational queries into SQLs. In particular, we propose two conversational

simply work as auxiliary training tasks to help with multi-turn conversational

describes the vibrations of an elastic beam with an attached rigid body and

principle in the form of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation with hinged boundary
conditions and interface condition at the point of attachment of the rigid
body. It is assumed that the sensors distributed along the beam provide output
information about the deformation in neighborhoods of the specified points of
the beam. Based on the variational form of the equations of motion, the
spectral problem for defining the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the
beam oscillations is obtained. Some properties of the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of the spectral problem are investigated. Finite-dimensional
approximations of the dynamic equations are constructed in the linear manifold
spanned by the system of eigenfunctions. For these Galerkin approximations,
observability conditions for the control system with incomplete information
about the state are derived. An algorithm for observer design with an arbitrary
number of modal coordinates is proposed for the differential equation on a
finite-dimensional manifold. Based on a quadratic Lyapunov function with
respect to the coordinates of the finite-dimensional state vector, the
exponential convergence of the observer dynamics is proved. The proposed method
of constructing a dynamic observer makes it possible to estimate the full
system state by the output signals characterizing the motion of particular
point only. Numerical simulations illustrate the exponential decay of the norm
of solutions of the system of ordinary differential equations that describes
the observation error.

in linear regression have failed. This applies to frequentist approaches based
on P-values and to Bayesian approaches although for different reasons. In the
first part of the paper 13 model based procedures are compared to the
model-free Gaussian covariate procedure in terms of the covariates selected and
the time required. The comparison is based on seven data sets and three
simulations. There is nothing special about these data sets which are often
used as examples in the literature. All the model based procedures failed.
  In the second part of the paper it is argued that the cause of this failure
is the very use of a model. If the model involves all the available covariates
standard P-values can be used. The use of P-values in this situation is quite
straightforward. As soon as the model specifies only some unknown subset of the
covariates the problem being to identify this subset the situation changes
radically. There are many P-values, they are dependent and most of them are
invalid. The P-value based approach collapses. The Bayesian paradigm also
assumes a correct model but although there are no conceptual problems with a
large number of covariates there is a considerable overhead causing
computational and allocation problems even for moderately sized data sets.
  The Gaussian covariate procedure is based on P-values which are defined as
the probability that a random Gaussian covariate is better than the covariate
being considered. These P-values are exact and valid whatever the situation.
The allocation requirements and the algorithmic complexity are both linear in
the size of the data making the procedure capable of handling large data sets.
It outperforms all the other procedures in every respect.

This gate depends on a global optimization to implement amplitude and phase

$1+1+2$ decomposed spacetimes with a preferred spatial direction, denoted
$e^{\mu}$, which are orthogonal to the fluid flow velocity of the spacetime and
admit a proper conformal transformation. To ensure a non-vanishing positivity
scalar curvature of the induced metric, we impose that the scalar curvature of
the conformal metric is non-negative and that the associated conformal factor
satisfies $\hat{\varphi}^2+2\hat{\hat{\varphi}}>0$, where $\hat{\ast}$ denotes
derivative along $e^{\mu}$. Firstly, it is demonstrated that such hypersurface
is either Einstein or the twist vanishes on it, and that the scalar curvature
of the induced metric is constant. It is then proved that if the hypersurface
is compact and of Einstein, and admits a proper conformal transformation, then
the hypersurface must be isomorphic to the $3$-sphere, where we make use of
well known results on Riemannian manifolds admitting conformal transformations.
If the hypersurface is not Einstein and has nowhere vanishing sheet expansion,
we show that this conclusion fails. However, with the additional conditions
that the scalar curvatures of the induced metric and the conformal metric
coincide, the associated conformal factor is strictly negative and the third
and higher order derivatives of the conformal factor vanish, the conclusion
follows. Furthermore, additional results are obtained under the conditions that
the scalar curvature of a metric conformal to the induced metric is also
constant. Finally, we consider some of our results in context of locally
rotationally symmetric spacetimes and show that, if the hypersurfaces are
compact and not of Einstein type, then under specified conditions the
hypersurface is isomorphic to the $3$-sphere, where we constructed explicit
examples of proper conformal Killing vector fields along $e^{\mu}$.

deconfinement phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$, which is
related to the spontaneous breaking of the global center symmetry. Including
heavy, dynamical quarks breaks the center symmetry explicitly and weakens the
first-order phase transition. For decreasing quark masses the first-order phase
transition turns into a smooth crossover at a $Z_2$-critical point. The
critical quark mass corresponding to this point has been examined with
$N_\text{f} = 2$ Wilson fermions for several $N_\tau$ in a recent study within
our group. For comparison, we also locate the critical point with $N_\text{f} =
2$ staggered fermions on $N_\tau = 8$ lattices. For this purpose we perform
Monte Carlo simulations for several quark mass values and various aspect ratios
in order to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit. The critical mass is
obtained by fitting to a finite size scaling formula of the kurtosis of the
Polyakov loop. Our results indicate large discretization effects, requiring
simulations on lattices with $N_\tau > 8$.

applications because of their favorable characteristics such as high
strength-to-weight ratio, design flexibility, limited stress concentrations,
planar force transfer, good damage tolerance, and fatigue resistance. Finding
the optimal process parameters for an adhesive bonding process is challenging:
the optimization is inherently multi-objective (aiming to maximize break
strength while minimizing cost), constrained (the process should not result in
any visual damage to the materials, and stress tests should not result in
failures that are adhesion-related), and uncertain (testing the same process
parameters several times may lead to different break strengths). Real-life
physical experiments in the lab are expensive to perform. Traditional
evolutionary approaches (such as genetic algorithms) are then ill-suited to
solve the problem, due to the prohibitive amount of experiments required for
evaluation. Although Bayesian optimization-based algorithms are preferred to
solve such expensive problems, few methods consider the optimization of more
than one (noisy) objective and several constraints at the same time. In this
research, we successfully applied specific machine learning techniques
(Gaussian Process Regression) to emulate the objective and constraint functions
based on a limited amount of experimental data. The techniques are embedded in
a Bayesian optimization algorithm, which succeeds in detecting Pareto-optimal
process settings in a highly efficient way (i.e., requiring a limited number of
physical experiments).

regional high resolution (5 km) atmospheric reanalysis dataset. The simulation
reproduces the main features of the near-surface stratification, as described
by the available observations. The seasonal evolution of the modeled mixed
layer depths (MLDs) in the RS is predominantly driven by atmospheric buoyancy
forcing, especially its heat flux component. Everywhere in the basin the model
MLs are deepest in January and February. The deepest MLDs develop in the
northern parts of the Gulf of Aqaba and in the western parts of the north RS.
The MLDs gradually shoal towards the south, reflecting the meridional gradient
of wintertime surface buoyancy loss. In spring and summer, the surface ocean
heat gain increases the stratification and the MLs are becoming shallow
everywhere in the basin. During this season wind may have a significant local
impact on the MLD. Particularly important are strong winds channeled by
topography, such as in the vicinity of the Strait of Bab-Al-Mandeb and the
straits connecting the two gulfs in the north, and lateral jets blowing through
mountain gaps, such as the Tokar jet in the central RS. The MLD distribution
further suggests influence by the general and mesoscale circulation. The
complex patterns of air-sea buoyancy flux, wind forcing, and the thermohaline
and mesoscale circulation, are all strongly imprinted on the MLD distribution.

non-insulating regimes, we have carried out numerically exact density-matrix

synthetic gauge flux per plaquette. Signatures of topological Lifshitz
transitions where the number Fermi points changes are found to persist even in

suggests that the orbital current can be captured by an appropriately
renormalized mean-field band structure, which is also described here.
Quantitative agreement between the mean-field and the DMRG results in the
intermediate interaction regime where $U \lesssim \Omega$ is demonstrated. We
also have observed that interactions can change the sign of the current
susceptibility at zero field and induce Lifshitz transitions between two
metallic phases, which is also captured by the mean-field theory. Correlation
effects beyond mean-field theory in the oscillations of the local inter-leg

convective instability by linear stability analyses of Darcy's law and mass
conservation for the flow and the concentration field. We find that the onset
time increases with the angle of inclination ($\theta$) until it reaches a
cut-off angle beyond which the system remains stable. The cut-off angle
increases with the Rayleigh number, $Ra$. The evolving wavenumber at the onset
exhibits a lateral velocity that depends non-monotonically on $\theta$ and
linearly on $Ra$. Instabilities are observed in gravitationally stable
configurations ($\theta \geq 90^{\circ}$) solely due to the non-uniform base
flow generating a velocity shear commonly associated with Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. These results quantify the role of medium tilt on convective
instabilities, which is of great importance to geological CO$_2$ sequestration.

chosen perturbations. The recently proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM)
algorithm conducts adversarial weight perturbation, encouraging the model to
converge to a flat minima. SAM finds a common adversarial weight perturbation
per-batch. Although per-instance adversarial weight perturbations are stronger
adversaries and can potentially lead to better generalization performance,
their computational cost is very high and thus it is impossible to use
per-instance perturbations efficiently in SAM. In this paper, we tackle this
efficiency bottleneck and propose sharpness-aware minimization with dynamic
reweighting (delta-SAM). Our theoretical analysis motivates that it is possible
to approach the stronger, per-instance adversarial weight perturbations using
reweighted per-batch weight perturbations. delta-SAM dynamically reweights
perturbation within each batch according to the theoretically principled

allows the optimizer to find efficient configurations faster than other

Our pose estimation method, dynamic projective spatial transformer network
(DProST), localizes the region of interest grid on the rays in camera space and
transforms the grid to object space by estimated pose. The transformed grid is
used as both a sampling grid and a new criterion of the estimated pose.
Additionally, because DProST does not require object vertices, our method can
be used in a mesh-less setting by replacing the mesh with a reconstructed

Feature pyramid is widely used to solve this problem but it might break the

practical application, it is difficult for common methods to improve the
detection accuracy of multi-scale traffic signs while ensuring real-time

pumping to the higher subbands and, thus, redefine the cutoff laws. As a proof
of principle, we consider the interaction of graphene nanoribbons, with zigzag
as well as armchair terminations, and resonant fields polarized along the
cross-ribbon direction. Here, this effect is particularly prominent due to many
nearly equi-separated energy levels. In such a scenario, a cascade resonance
effect can take place in high-harmonic generation when the field strength is
above a critical threshold, which is completely different from the harmonic
generation mechanism of atoms, molecules and bulk solids. We further discuss
the implications not only for other systems in a nanoribbon geometry, but also
systems where only a few subbands (energy levels) meet this frequency-matching
condition by considering a generalized multilevel Hamiltonian. Our study
highlights that cascade resonance bears fundamentally distinct influence on the
laws of harmonic generation, specifically the cutoff laws based on laser
duration, field strength, and wavelength, thus unraveling new insights in
solid-state high-harmonic generation.

cooperatively to a multiple antenna ground station (GS) are investigated. These
satellite swarms have the benefit of much higher spatial separation in the
transmit antennas than traditional big satellites with antenna arrays,
promising a massive increase in spectral efficiency. However, this would
require instantaneous perfect channel state information (CSI) and strong
cooperation between satellites. In practice, orbital velocities around 7.5 km/s
lead to very short channel coherence times on the order of fractions of the
inter-satellite propagation delay, invalidating these assumptions. In this
paper, we propose a distributed linear precoding scheme and a GS equalizer
relying on local position information. In particular, each satellite only
requires information about its own position and that of the GS, while the GS
has complete positional information. Due to the deterministic nature of
satellite movement this information is easily obtained and no inter-satellite
information exchange is required during transmission. Based on the underlying
geometrical channel approximation, the optimal inter-satellite distance is
obtained analytically. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed scheme is,
on average, within 99.8% of the maximum achievable rate for instantaneous CSI

In this paper, we try to model the effect of vaccination in controlling the
pandemic, particularly in context to the third wave which is predicted to hit
globally. Here we have modified the SEIRD model by introducing a vaccination
term. One of our main assumptions is that the infection rate (\b{eta}(t)) is
oscillatory. This oscillatory nature has been discussed earlier in literature
with reference to the seasonality of epidemics. However, in our case we invoke
this nature of the infection rate (\b{eta}(t)) to model the cyclical behavior
of the COVID-19 pandemic within a short period. This study focuses on a
minimalistic approach where we have logically deduced that the infection rate
(\b{eta}(t)) and the vaccination rate ({\lambda}) are the most important
parameters while the other parameters can be assumed to be constants throughout
the simulation. Finally, we have studied the rich interplay between the
infection rate (\b{eta}(t)) and the vaccination rate ({\lambda}) on the
infectious cases of COVID-19 and made some robust conclusions regarding the
global behavior of this pandemic in near future.

our experiments, molecules were spun up by an optical centrifuge and brought to
the super-rotor state that retains its rotation for a relatively long time.
Polarizability properties of fast-rotating molecules were analyzed considering
the rotational Doppler effect and Coriolis forces. We used molecular dynamics
simulations to account for intermolecular collisions. We found, both
experimentally and theoretically, a nontrivial nonmonotonic time dependence of
the polarization rotation angle. This time dependence reflects transfer of the
angular momentum from rotating molecules to the macroscopic gas flow, which may
lead to the birth of gas vortices. Moreover, we show that the long-term
behavior of the polarization rotation is sensitive to the details of the
intermolecular potential. Thus, the polarization drag effect appears as a novel
diagnostic tool for the characterization of intermolecular interaction

training sample and has gained considerable attention recently for improving
the generalizability of neural networks. A straightforward and widely used
extension of Mixup is to combine with regional dropout-like methods: removing
random patches from a sample and replacing it with the features from another
sample. Albeit their simplicity and effectiveness, these methods are prone to
create harmful samples due to their randomness. To address this issue, 'maximum
saliency' strategies were recently proposed: they select only the most
informative features to prevent such a phenomenon. However, they now suffer
from lack of sample diversification as they always deterministically select
regions with maximum saliency, injecting bias into the augmented data. In this
paper, we present, a novel, yet simple Mixup-variant that captures the best of
both worlds. Our idea is two-fold. By stochastically sampling the features and
'grafting' them onto another sample, our method effectively generates diverse
yet meaningful samples. Its second ingredient is to produce the label of the
grafted sample by mixing the labels in a saliency-calibrated fashion, which
rectifies supervision misguidance introduced by the random sampling procedure.
Our experiments under CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet datasets show that our
scheme outperforms the current state-of-the-art augmentation strategies not

information such as its underlying distribution, e.g. $k$-way marginals or
correlations are similarly sensitive or secret. We here explore for the first
time whether a model leaks information about the correlations between the input
variables of its training dataset, something we name correlation inference
attack. We first propose a model-less attack, showing how an attacker can
exploit the spherical parametrization of correlation matrices to make an
informed guess based on the correlations between the input variables and the
target variable alone. Second, we propose a model-based attack, showing how an
attacker can exploit black-box access to the model to infer the correlations
using shadow models trained on synthetic datasets. Our synthetic data
generation approach combines Gaussian copula-based generative modeling with a
carefully adapted procedure for sampling correlation matrices under
constraints. Third, we evaluate our model-based attack against Logistic
Regression and Multilayer Perceptron models and show it to strongly outperform
the model-less attack on three real-world tabular datasets, indicating that the

the common use of additive noise or adversarial noise for data augmentation, we
propose an entirely different perspective by directly training on pure random
noise images. We present a new Distribution-Aware Routing Batch Normalization

natural images within the same network. This encourages generalization and
suppresses overfitting. Our proposed method significantly improves imbalanced
classification performance, obtaining state-of-the-art results on a large

extremely simple and easy to use as a general new augmentation tool (on top of
existing augmentations), and can be incorporated in any training scheme. It
does not require any specialized data generation or training procedures, thus
keeping training fast and efficient.

kinematics to the rapidity scale of the dipole amplitude in the scattering.
This brings the perturbative expansion under control and enables us to do

combining the NLO accuracy inclusive cross sections with beyond leading order
BK evolution prescriptions. This results in the state-of-the-art accuracy
comparison between CGC theory and HERA data, and determination of the dipole

number of participants, and their correctness requires the existence of bounds
on message delays and on the relative speed of processes after reaching Global
Stabilization Time. These characteristics make partially synchronous algorithms
parameterized in the number of processes, and parametric in time bounds, which
render automated verification of partially synchronous algorithms challenging.
In this paper, we present a case study on formal verification of both safety
and liveness of the Chandra and Toueg failure detector that is based on partial
synchrony. To this end, we first introduce and formalize the class of symmetric
point-to-point algorithms that contains the failure detector. Second, we show
that these symmetric point-to-point algorithms have a cutoff, and the cutoff
results hold in three models of computation: synchrony, asynchrony, and partial
synchrony. As a result, one can verify them by model checking small instances,
but the verification problem stays parametric in time. Next, we specify the
failure detector and the partial synchrony assumptions in three frameworks:
TLA+, IVy, and counter automata. Importantly, we tune our modeling to use the
strength of each method: (1) We are using counters to encode message buffers
with counter automata, (2) we are using first-order relations to encode message
buffers in IVy, and (3) we are using both approaches in TLA+. By running the
tools for TLA+ and counter automata, we demonstrate safety for fixed time
bounds. By running IVy, we prove safety for arbitrary time bounds. Moreover, we
show how to verify liveness of the failure detector by reducing the
verification problem to safety verification. Thus, both properties are verified
by developing inductive invariants with IVy.

\operatorname{Der}(\Bbbk[t])$. In particular, we prove that certain subalgebras
of $W_{\geq -1}$ (denoted by $L(f)$, where $f \in \Bbbk[t]$) have
non-noetherian universal enveloping algebras, and provide a sufficient
condition for a subalgebra of $W_{\geq -1}$ to have a non-noetherian universal
enveloping algebra. Furthermore, we make significant progress on a
classification of subalgebras of $W_{\geq -1}$ by showing that any
infinite-dimensional subalgebra must be contained in some $L(f)$ in a canonical
way.

  Representation Learning","Accepted to AAAI 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised graph-level representation learning plays a crucial role in a
variety of tasks such as molecular property prediction and community analysis,
especially when data annotation is expensive. Currently, most of the
best-performing graph embedding methods are based on Infomax principle. The
performance of these methods highly depends on the selection of negative
samples and hurt the performance, if the samples were not carefully selected.
Inter-graph similarity-based methods also suffer if the selected set of graphs
for similarity matching is low in quality. To address this, we focus only on
utilizing the current input graph for embedding learning. We are motivated by
an observation from real-world graph generation processes where the graphs are
formed based on one or more global factors which are common to all elements of
the graph (e.g., topic of a discussion thread, solubility level of a molecule).
We hypothesize extracting these common factors could be highly beneficial.
Hence, this work proposes a new principle for unsupervised graph representation
learning: Graph-wise Common latent Factor EXtraction (GCFX). We further propose
a deep model for GCFX, deepGCFX, based on the idea of reversing the
above-mentioned graph generation process which could explicitly extract common
latent factors from an input graph and achieve improved results on downstream
tasks to the current state-of-the-art. Through extensive experiments and
analysis, we demonstrate that, while extracting common latent factors is
beneficial for graph-level tasks to alleviate distractions caused by local
variations of individual nodes or local neighbourhoods, it also benefits
node-level tasks by enabling long-range node dependencies, especially for
disassortative graphs.

selectively map cognitive processing signals to linguistic features. We define
the mapping procedure as a bridging task and develop 12 bridging tasks for
lexical, syntactic and semantic features. The proposed framework only requires
cognitive processing signals recorded under natural reading as inputs, and can
be used to detect a wide range of linguistic features with a single cognitive
dataset. Observations from experiment results resonate with previous
neuroscience findings. In addition to this, our experiments also reveal a
number of interesting findings, such as the correlation between contextual

based on image-to-image translation is gaining importance in this field by
addressing variabilities without the manual overhead. Here, we tackle the
variation of different histological stains by unsupervised stain-to-stain
translation to enable a stain-independent applicability of a deep learning
segmentation model. We use CycleGANs for stain-to-stain translation in kidney
histopathology, and propose two novel approaches to improve translational
effectivity. First, we integrate a prior segmentation network into the CycleGAN
for a self-supervised, application-oriented optimization of translation through
semantic guidance, and second, we incorporate extra channels to the translation
output to implicitly separate artificial meta-information otherwise encoded for
tackling underdetermined reconstructions. The latter showed partially superior
performances to the unmodified CycleGAN, but the former performed best in all
stains providing instance-level Dice scores ranging between 78% and 92% for
most kidney structures, such as glomeruli, tubules, and veins. However,
CycleGANs showed only limited performance in the translation of other
structures, e.g. arteries. Our study also found somewhat lower performance for
all structures in all stains when compared to segmentation in the original

unlikely to produce generally applicable simulated stains.

after their synthesis from ribosomes in the cell. Most in vitro protein folding
studies have focused on single-domain proteins. Hence, it is important to
understand the folding process of multi-domain proteins, especially when
domains are discontinuous. We choose the Maltose binding protein (MBP) as a
model system. In particular, we studied a mutant of MBP that folds slowly.
Here, using two- and three-color single-molecule Foerster resonance energy
transfer (smFRET) experiments, we study the refolding of both the domains and
the interaction between the domains of DM-MBP. Initial two-color smFRET
measurements of the N-terminal domain (NTD) reveal the presence of a folding
intermediate. The same folding intermediate is observed in measurements
monitoring the C- terminal domain (CTD) and the NTD-CTD (N-C) interface. The
refolding intermediate is dynamic on the sub-millisecond timescale.
Quantitative analysis on underlying dynamic interconversions revealed a delay
in NTD folding imposed by the entropic barrier being the primary cause for slow
DM-MBP folding. Moreover, CTD folds after NTD completes the folding. Using
three-color smFRET, we could show the NTD folds first and CTD later in a same
protein. Molecular dynamic simulations for temperature-induced unfolding on WT-
and DM-MBP identify a folding nucleus in the NTD, which is rich in hydrophobic
residues, and explains why the two mutations slow down the folding kinetics. In
the presence of the bacterial Hsp60 chaperonin system GroEL/ES, we observe that
DM-MBP is dynamic within the chaperonin cavity but the chaperonin limits the
conformational space of substrate. Hence, confinement aids DM-MBP in overcoming
the entropic barrier. The study reports on the subtle tuning and co-dependency
for protein folding between two-domains with a discontinuous arrangement.

to assess porosity, in-situ, during the manufacturing process. In this paper,
the terahertz frequency-domain (THz-FD) technique was explored as a fast,
non-destructive, and sensitive technique for porosity measurement of
pharmaceutical tablets. We studied a sample set of 69 tablets with different
design factors, such as particle size of the active pharmaceutical ingredient
(API), Ibuprofen, particle size of the filler, Mannitol, API concentration, and
compaction force. The signal transmitted through each tablet was measured
across the frequency range 500-750 GHz using a vector network analyzer combined
with a quasi-optical set-up consisting of four off-axis parabolic mirrors to
guide and focus the beam. We first extracted the effective refractive index of
each tablet from the measured complex transmission coefficients and then
translated it to porosity, using an empirical linear relation between effective
refractive index and tablet density. The results show that the THz-FD technique
was highly sensitive to the variations of the design factors, showing that
filler particle size and compaction force had a significant impact on the
effective refractive index of the tablets and, consequently, porosity.
Moreover, the fragmentation behaviour of particles was observed by THz porosity
measurements and was verified with scanning electron microscopy of the
cross-section of tablets. In conclusion, the THz-FD technique, based on
electronic solutions, allows for fast, sensitive, and non-destructive porosity
measurement that opens for compact instrument systems capable of in-situ

generic linear polyelectrolyte (PE) chain with the help of coarse-grained
computer simulations. The ion-chain coupling is discussed in the form of
binding time, mean-square-displacement (MSD) relative to the chain, local ion
transport coefficient, and spatio-temporal correlations in the effective
charge. We have shown that a counterion exhibits sub-diffusive behavior
$\langle \delta R^2 \rangle \sim t^\delta$, $\delta\approx0.9$ w.r.t. chain's
centre of mass (COM). The MSD of ions perpendicularly outwards from the chain
segment exhibits a smaller sub-diffusive exponent compared to the one relative
to the chain's COM. Further, we confirm that the effective
diffusion-coefficient of counterions is strongly coupled with the chain. The
effective diffusivity of ion is the lowest in chain's close proximity,
extending up to length-scale of the radius of gyration Rg. Beyond Rg at larger
distances, they attain diffusivity of free ion with a smooth cross-over from
the adsorbed regime to the free ion regime. We have shown that the effective
diffusivity drastically decreases for the higher valent ions, while the
crossover length scale remains the same. Conversely, with increasing salt
concentration the coupling-length scale reduces, while the diffusivity remains
unaltered. The effective diffusivity of adsorbed-ion reveals an exponential
reduction with electrostatic interaction strength. We further corroborate this
from the binding time of ions on the chain, which also grows exponentially with
the coupling strength of the ion-polymer duo. Moreover, the binding time of
ions exhibits a weak dependence with salt concentration for the monovalent
salt, while for higher valent salts the binding time decreases dramatically
with concentration.

both radar and communication functionalities using the same hardware platform,

integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Spacetime adaptive processing
(STAP) in multi-antenna radar systems is the primary tool for detecting moving
targets in the presence of strong clutter. The idea of joint spatial-temporal
optimization in STAP-based radar systems is consistent with the concept of
symbol-level precoding (SLP) for multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
communications, which optimizes the transmit waveform for each of the
transmitted symbols. In this paper, we combine STAP and SLP and propose a novel
STAP-SLP-based DFRC system that enjoys the advantages of both techniques. The
radar output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is maximized by
jointly optimizing the transmit waveform and receive filter, while satisfying
the communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraint and various waveform
constraints including constant-modulus, similarity and peak-to-average power

coupled to an one-dimensional bosonic medium is explored. We determine the
ground state phase diagram of the system according to the impurity-medium
entanglement and the impurities two-body correlations. Specifically, bound
impurity structures reminiscent of bipolarons for strong attractive couplings
as well as configurations with two clustered or separated impurities in the
repulsive case are identified. The interval of existence of these phases
depends strongly on the impurity-impurity interactions and external confinement
of the medium. Accordingly the impurities dynamical response, triggered by
suddenly ramping down the central potential barrier, is affected by the
medium's trapping geometry. In particular, for a box-confined medium repulsive
impurity-medium couplings lead, due to attractive induced interactions, to the
localization of the impurities around the trap center. In contrast, for a
harmonically trapped medium the impurities perform a periodic collision and
expansion dynamics further interpreted in terms of a two-body effective model.
Our findings elucidate the correlation aspects of the collisional physics of
impurities which should be accessible in recent cold atom experiments.

precision. A common alternative, referred to as top-$K$ classification, is to
choose some number $K$ (commonly around 5) and to return the $K$ labels with
the highest scores. Unfortunately, for unambiguous cases, $K>1$ is too many
and, for very ambiguous cases, $K \leq 5$ (for example) can be too small. An
alternative sensible strategy is to use an adaptive approach in which the
number of labels returned varies as a function of the computed ambiguity, but
must average to some particular $K$ over all the samples. We denote this
alternative average-$K$ classification. This paper formally characterizes the
ambiguity profile when average-$K$ classification can achieve a lower error
rate than a fixed top-$K$ classification. Moreover, it provides natural
estimation procedures for both the fixed-size and the adaptive classifier and
proves their consistency. Finally, it reports experiments on real-world image
data sets revealing the benefit of average-$K$ classification over top-$K$ in
practice. Overall, when the ambiguity is known precisely, average-$K$ is never
worse than top-$K$, and, in our experiments, when it is estimated, this also
holds.

be the sources of high energy neutrinos. The most prominent candidate so far is
the blazar TXS 0506+056, which is found to be associated with the neutrino
event IceCube-170922A. Furthermore, the IceCube reported an excess of neutrinos
towards TXS 0506+056 between September 2014 and March 2015, even though this

nearby gamma-ray source, the quasar PKS 0502+049. Motivated by this, we studied
the parsec-scale structures of TXS 0506+056 and PKS 0502+049 through radio
interferometry at 8 and 15\,GHz. We identified twelve jet components in TXS
0506+056 and seven components in PKS 0502+049. The most reliable jet components
show superluminal speeds ranging from 9.5c to 66c in the case of TXS 0506+056,
and from 14.3c to 59c for PKS 0502+049, which were used to estimate a lower

novel approach using simultaneously the brightness temperature of the core
region and the apparent speeds of the jet components allowed us to infer basic
jet parameters for TXS 0506+056 at distinct epochs. We also found that the
emergence of new jet components coincides with the occurrence of gamma-ray

widely to develop suitable models to predict and mitigate attacks. Still, the
attacks could trick the machine learning models and misclassify outputs

this paper, we address the type of adversarial attacks and their impact on
smart healthcare systems. We propose a model to examine how adversarial attacks
impact machine learning classifiers. To test the model, we use a medical image

Our results demonstrate that the adversarial attack misclassifies the images,

efficient simulation-based Bayesian inference in various research domains. In
particular, the BayesFlow framework uses a two-step approach to enable
amortized parameter estimation in settings where the likelihood function is
implicitly defined by a simulation program. But how faithful is such inference
when simulations are poor representations of reality? In this paper, we
conceptualize the types of model misspecification arising in simulation-based
inference and systematically investigate the performance of the BayesFlow
framework under these misspecifications. We propose an augmented optimization
objective which imposes a probabilistic structure on the latent data space and
utilize maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to detect potentially catastrophic
misspecifications during inference undermining the validity of the obtained
results. We verify our detection criterion on a number of artificial and
realistic misspecifications, ranging from toy conjugate models to complex
models of decision making and disease outbreak dynamics applied to real data.
Further, we show that posterior inference errors increase as a function of the
distance between the true data-generating distribution and the typical set of
simulations in the latent summary space. Thus, we demonstrate the dual utility
of MMD as a method for detecting model misspecification and as a proxy for
verifying the faithfulness of amortized Bayesian inference.

effective GAN training due to the noise caused by unstable Monte Carlo

is proposed for compressible turbulence modeling on unresolved grids. Within
the non-equilibrium time-relaxation framework, NTRKM is extended in the form of
modified Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model. Based on the first-order Chapman-Enskog
expansion, NTRKM connects with the six-variable macroscopic governing
equations. The first five governing equations correspond to the conservative
laws in mass, momentum and total energy, while the sixth equation governs the
evolution of unresolved turbulence kinetic energy Kutke. The unknowns in NTRKM,
including turbulent relaxation time and source term, are determined by
essential gradient-type assumption and standard dynamic modeling approach.
Current generalized kinetic model on unresolved grids consequently offers a
profound mesoscopic understanding for one-equation subgrid-scale turbulence
kinetic energy Ksgs model in compressible large eddy simulation. To solve NTRKM
accurately and robustly, a non-equilibrium gas-kinetic scheme is developed,
which succeeds the well-established gas-kinetic scheme for simulating
Navier-Stokes equations. Three-dimensional decaying compressible isotropic
turbulence and temporal compressible plane mixing layer on unresolved grids are
simulated to evaluate the generalized kinetic model and non-equilibrium
gas-kinetic scheme. The performance of key turbulent quantities up to
second-order statistics confirms that NTRKM is comparable with the widely-used
eddy-viscosity Smagorinsky model (SM) and dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM).
Specifically, compared with the DNS solution in temporal compressible plane
mixing layer, the performance of NTRKM is much closer with DSM and better than
SM. This study provides a workable approach for compressible turbulence
modeling on unresolved grids.

then propose a first practical solution for computing Shapley values that
adopts tools from probabilistic query evaluation. In particular, we capture the
dependence of query answers on input database facts using Boolean expressions
(data provenance), and then transform it, via Knowledge Compilation, into a
particular circuit form for which we devise an algorithm for computing the
Shapley values. Our second practical solution is a faster yet inexact approach
that transforms the provenance to a Conjunctive Normal Form and uses a
heuristic to compute the Shapley values. Our experiments on TPC-H and IMDB

without being restricted by their misses. We call our model Bottom Up Top Down
DEtection TRansformers (BUTD-DETR) because it uses both language guidance (top

referential grounding and uses object labels as language prompts to be grounded
in the visual scene, augmenting supervision for the referential grounding task

RIS is first proposed, and a far-near field channel model based on planar waves

sum-rate of uplink communications, we formulate a joint optimization problem
over subcarrier allocation, power allocation and RIS transmissive coefficient
design while taking account of user quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. Due to
the coupling of optimization variables, the optimization problem is non-convex,
so it is challenging to solve it directly. In order to tackle this problem, the
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is utilized to decouple the
optimization variables and divide the problem into two sub-problems to solve.
First, the problem of joint subcarrier allocation and power allocation is
solved via the Lagrangian dual decomposition method. Then, the RIS transmissive
coefficient design scheme can be obtained by applying difference-of-convex (DC)
programming, successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty function
methods. Finally, the two sub-problems are iterated alternately until
convergence is achieved. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm

Specifically, the dynamical equilibrium requires the presence of additional
matter to hold the system apart. As long as this extra matter satisfies the
dominant energy condition, the mass of the combined system is positive. Thus,
the very same reason why energy cannot travel backwards in time could be the
underlying mechanism behind the positivity of the mass. We discuss the

place/transition net that simply turns the coloured tokens into black tokens. A
coloured net and its skeleton are related by a net morphism. For the
application of the skeleton as an abstraction method in the model checking
process, we need to establish a simulation relation between the state spaces of
the two nets. Then, universal temporal properties (properties of the $ ACTL^* $
logic) are preserved. The abstraction relation induced by a net morphism is not
necessarily a simulation relation, due to a subtle issue related to deadlocks.
We discuss several situations where the abstraction relation induced by a net
morphism is as well a simulation relation, thus preserving $ACTL^*$ properties.
We further propose a partition refinement algorithm for folding a
place/transition net into a coloured net. This way, skeleton abstraction
becomes available for models given as place/transition nets. Experiments
demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed technology. Using skeleton
abstraction, we are capable of solving problems that have not been solved

to the presence of metal lines in their spectra. Cool metal-rich white dwarfs,
which left the main-sequence many Gyr ago, allow the study of the remnants of
the oldest planetary systems. Despite their low effective temperatures
($T_\mathrm{eff}$), a non-neglible amount of their flux is emitted in the near
ultraviolet (NUV), where many overlapping metal lines can potentially be
detected. We have observed three metal-rich cool white dwarfs with the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST),
and compare the results determined from the NUV data with those previously
derived from the analysis of optical spectroscopy. For two of the white dwarfs,
SDSSJ1038-0036 and SDSSJ1535+1247, we find reasonable agreement with our
previous analysis and the new combined fit of optical and NUV data. For the
third object, SDSSJ0956+5912, including the STIS data leads to a ten percent
lower $T_\mathrm{eff}$, though we do not identify a convincing explanation for
this discrepancy. The unusual abundances found for SDSSJ0956+5912 suggest that
the accreted parent-body was composed largely of water ice and magnesium
silicates, and with a mass of up to $\simeq 2\times 10^{25}$g. Furthermore
SDSSJ0956+5912 shows likely traces of atomic carbon in the NUV. While molecular
carbon is not observed in the optical, we demonstrate that the large quantity
of metals accreted by SDSSJ0956+5912 can suppress the C$_2$ molecular bands,

valuable minerals are measured for mine prospecting. Popular analysis methods,
like PCA, often by design do not account for the spatial nature of the data.
Thus they, together with their spatial variants, must be employed very
carefully. Clearly, it is preferable to use methods that were specifically
designed for such data, like spatial blind source separation (SBSS). However,
SBSS requires two tuning parameters, which are themselves complex spatial
objects. Setting these parameters involves navigating two large and
interdependent parameter spaces, while also taking into account prior knowledge
of the physical reality represented by the data. To support analysts in this
process, we developed a visual analytics prototype. We evaluated it with
experts in visualization, SBSS, and geochemistry. Our evaluations show that our

we shall investigate the the possibility of phase transitions, and in general
thermodynamic phenomena, of EiBI-anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole with

the full Euclidean action formalism in this model. We provide a counterterm to

found to obey the first law of the black hole mechanics and the Smarr's law for
black holes with $\Lambda\neq0$. Related to the second feature, we obtained the
forbidden range of parameter space for EiBI AdS black hole with global
monopole, which corresponds to $\frac{-(1 - \Delta)}{\Lambda } \leq \kappa \leq
-\frac{1}{\Lambda }$. The dependencies on $\Lambda$, the EiBI constant $\kappa$

self-consistent algorithms cannot be easily deployed for the Green's function
methods, because of non-convex grand potential functional and non-idempotent

the self-energy matrix and changing chemical potential or fluctuations in the
number of particles can make the optimization problem more difficult. In this
paper, we study acceleration techniques to target the self-consistent solution
of the Dyson equation directly. We use the direct inversion in the iterative
subspace (DIIS), the least-squared commutator in the iterative subspace
(LCIIS), and the Krylov space accelerated inexact Newton method (KAIN). We
observe that the definition of the residual has a significant impact on the
convergence of the iterative procedure. Based on the Dyson equation, we
generalize the concept of the commutator residual used in DIIS (CDIIS) and
LCIIS, and compare it with the difference residual used in DIIS and KAIN. The
commutator residuals outperform the difference residuals for all considered
molecular and solid systems within both GW and GF2. The generalized CDIIS and
LCIIS methods successfully converged restricted GF2 calculations for a number
of strongly correlated systems, which could not be converged before. We also
provide practical recommendations to guide convergence in such pathological

all leading-order contributions of order $\alpha_s^2\alpha^2$ for the specified

of the top quarks have been simulated retaining spin-correlations in all
tree-level matrix elements. We consider the case of the Large Hadron Collider

in the fiducial volume where the invariant mass of the lepton pairs is centered
around the $Z$-boson mass to corresponding predictions for $t\bar{t}Z$ on-shell
production with $Z\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$. We find that off-shell effects in
$t\bar t \ell^+\ell^-$ are in general small at the level of the total cross
section, but can decrease the tail of the leptons' transverse momentum
distributions by 10-20% and, in these regions, they are visible beyond the
scale uncertainty due to renormalization and factorization scale variation.

are gaseous detectors widely used in high-energy and cosmic rays physics when
large detection areas are needed. However, the best gaseous mixtures are
currently based on tetrafluoroethane, which has the undesirable characteristic
of a large Global Warming Potential (GWP) of about 1400 and because of this, it
is currently being phased out from industrial use. As a possible replacement,
tetrafluoropropene (which has a GWP close to 1) has been taken into account.
Since tetrafluoropropene is more electronegative than tetrafluoroethane, it has
to be diluted with gases with a lower attachment coefficient in order to
maintain the operating voltage close to 10 kV. One of the main candidates for
this role is carbon dioxide. In order to ascertain the feasibility and the
performance of tetrafluoropropene-CO2 based mixtures, an R&D program is being

ingredient for Josephson diodes is the asymmetric proximity process inside the
tunneling barrier. From the symmetry breaking point of view, there are two
types of Josephson diodes, inversion breaking and time-reversal breaking. For
the inversion breaking case, applying voltage bias could effectively tune the
proximity process like the voltage-dependent Rashba coupling or electric
polarization giving rise to $I_c(V)\neq I_c(-V)$ and $I_{r+}\neq I_{r-}$. For
the time-reversal breaking case, the current flow could adjust the internal
time-reversal breaking field like magnetism or time-reversal breaking
electron-electron pairing, which leads to $I_{c+}\neq I_{c-}$. All these

preventing this goal: 1) generating mode-locked comb states usually requires a
significant amount of pump power and 2) the requirement to align laser and
resonator frequency significantly complicates operation and limits the
tunability of the comb lines. Here, we address these problems by using
microresonators on an AlGaAs on-insulator platform to generate dark-pulse
microcombs. This highly nonlinear platform dramatically relaxes fabrication
requirements and leads to a record-low pump power of less than 1 mW for
coherent comb generation. Dark-pulse microcombs facilitated by
thermally-controlled avoided mode-crossings are accessed by direct DFB laser
pumping. Without any feedback or control circuitries, the comb shows good
coherence and stability. This approach also leads to an unprecedented wide
chirping range of all the comb lines. Our work provides a route to realize
power-efficient, simple and reconfigurable microcombs that can be seamlessly

rate to quantify this issue. After confirming the high degree of oversmoothing
in neural machine translation, we propose to explicitly minimize the
oversmoothing rate during training. We conduct a set of experiments to study
the effect of the proposed regularization on both model distribution and
decoding performance. We use a neural machine translation task as the testbed

three major findings. First, we can control the oversmoothing rate of the model
by tuning the strength of the regularization. Second, by enhancing the
oversmoothing loss contribution, the probability and the rank of <eos> token
decrease heavily at positions where it is not supposed to be. Third, the
proposed regularization impacts the outcome of beam search especially when a
large beam is used. The degradation of translation quality (measured in BLEU)
with a large beam significantly lessens with lower oversmoothing rate, but the
degradation compared to smaller beam sizes remains to exist. From these
observations, we conclude that the high degree of oversmoothing is the main
reason behind the degenerate case of overly probable short sequences in a

iterations to converge to a scheduling decision, subsequently lowering the
scheduling time. Instead of a vanilla DNN, GOSH uses a Natural Parameter

Khmer word search is challenging given its complex writing system. Multiple
orders of characters and different spelling realizations of words impose a
constraint on Khmer word search functionality. Additionally, spelling mistakes
are common since robust spellcheckers are not commonly available across the
input device platforms. These challenges hinder the use of Khmer language in
search-embedded applications. Moreover, due to the absence of WordNet-like
lexical databases for Khmer language, it is impossible to establish semantic
relation between words, enabling semantic search. In this paper, we propose a
set of robust solutions to the above challenges associated with Khmer word

possibility to use even FP16 and Posit16 (half) precision for storing fluid

assumes a high degree of proficiency on part of the human painter. In order to
facilitate the human painting process, substantial research efforts have been
made on teaching machines how to ""paint like a human"", and then using the
trained agent as a painting assistant tool for human users. However, current
research in this direction is often reliant on a progressive grid-based
division strategy wherein the agent divides the overall image into successively
finer grids, and then proceeds to paint each of them in parallel. This
inevitably leads to artificial painting sequences which are not easily
intelligible to human users. To address this, we propose a novel painting
approach which learns to generate output canvases while exhibiting a more
human-like painting style. The proposed painting pipeline Intelli-Paint
consists of 1) a progressive layering strategy which allows the agent to first
paint a natural background scene representation before adding in each of the
foreground objects in a progressive fashion. 2) We also introduce a novel
sequential brushstroke guidance strategy which helps the painting agent to
shift its attention between different image regions in a semantic-aware manner.
3) Finally, we propose a brushstroke regularization strategy which allows for
~60-80% reduction in the total number of required brushstrokes without any
perceivable differences in the quality of the generated canvases. Through both
quantitative and qualitative results, we show that the resulting agents not
only show enhanced efficiency in output canvas generation but also exhibit a
more natural-looking painting style which would better assist human users

the deployment of reinforcement learning for many physical systems. This is
particularly true for systems with continuous and high-dimensional state and

the sparse rewards setting, where the low-level state information required for
the design of dense rewards is unavailable. Adversarial imitation learning
(AIL) can partially overcome this barrier by leveraging expert-generated
demonstrations of optimal behaviour and providing, essentially, a replacement
for dense reward information. Unfortunately, the availability of expert
demonstrations does not necessarily improve an agent's capability to explore
effectively and, as we empirically show, can lead to inefficient or stagnated
learning. We present Learning from Guided Play (LfGP), a framework in which we
leverage expert demonstrations of, in addition to a main task, multiple
auxiliary tasks. Subsequently, a hierarchical model is used to learn each task
reward and policy through a modified AIL procedure, in which exploration of all
tasks is enforced via a scheduler composing different tasks together. This
affords many benefits: learning efficiency is improved for main tasks with
challenging bottleneck transitions, expert data becomes reusable between tasks,
and transfer learning through the reuse of learned auxiliary task models
becomes possible. Our experimental results in a challenging multitask robotic
manipulation domain indicate that our method compares favourably to supervised
imitation learning and to a state-of-the-art AIL method. Code is available at

is how to design and train a deep neural network capable of learning
generalizable features sensitive to manipulations in novel data, whilst
specific to prevent false alarms on the authentic. We propose multi-view
feature learning to jointly exploit tampering boundary artifacts and the noise
view of the input image. As both clues are meant to be semantic-agnostic, the

out using RCT data. However, RCT data may be too limited to validate surrogate
endpoints. In this paper, we sought to improve validation of surrogate
endpoints with the inclusion of real world evidence (RWE).
  Study Design and Setting: We use data from comparative RWE (cRWE) and single
arm RWE (sRWE), to supplement RCT evidence for evaluation of progression free
survival (PFS) as a surrogate endpoint to overall survival (OS) in metastatic
colorectal cancer (mCRC). Treatment effect estimates from RCTs, cRWE and
matched sRWE, comparing anti-angiogenic treatments with chemotherapy, were used
to inform surrogacy patterns and predictions of the treatment effect on OS from
the treatment effect on PFS.
  Results: Seven RCTs, four cRWE studies and three matched sRWE studies were
identified. The addition of RWE to RCTs reduced the uncertainty around the
estimates of the parameters for the surrogate relationship. Addition of RWE to
RCTs also improved the accuracy and precision of predictions of the treatment

  Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS) aims at assigning a class label to each
pixel, uniquely segmenting and identifying all object instances consistently
across all frames. Classic solutions usually decompose the VPS task into
several sub-tasks and utilize multiple surrogates (e.g. boxes and masks,
centres and offsets) to represent objects. However, this divide-and-conquer
strategy requires complex post-processing in both spatial and temporal domains
and is vulnerable to failures from surrogate tasks. In this paper, inspired by
object-centric learning which learns compact and robust object representations,
we present Slot-VPS, the first end-to-end framework for this task. We encode
all panoptic entities in a video, including both foreground instances and
background semantics, with a unified representation called panoptic slots. The
coherent spatio-temporal object's information is retrieved and encoded into the
panoptic slots by the proposed Video Panoptic Retriever, enabling it to
localize, segment, differentiate, and associate objects in a unified manner.
Finally, the output panoptic slots can be directly converted into the class,
mask, and object ID of panoptic objects in the video. We conduct extensive
ablation studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two
benchmark datasets, Cityscapes-VPS (\textit{val} and test sets) and VIPER
(\textit{val} set), achieving new state-of-the-art performance of 63.7, 63.3

super-resolution (VSR), due to their increased computational efficiency,
temporal receptive field and temporal consistency compared to sliding-window

motion (i.e. in which some parts of the scene barely move), recurrent models
diverge through recurrent processing, generating high frequency artifacts. To
the best of our knowledge, no study about VSR pointed out this instability
problem, which can be critical for some real-world applications. Video
surveillance is a typical example where such artifacts would occur, as both the
camera and the scene stay static for a long time.
  In this work, we expose instabilities of existing recurrent VSR networks on
long sequences with low motion. We demonstrate it on a new long sequence
dataset Quasi-Static Video Set, that we have created. Finally, we introduce a
new framework of recurrent VSR networks that is both stable and competitive,
based on Lipschitz stability theory. We propose a new recurrent VSR network,
coined Middle Recurrent Video Super-Resolution (MRVSR), based on this
framework. We empirically show its competitive performance on long sequences

star, in 1995, the number of detected exoplanets has increased enormously. Over
the past two decades, observational instruments (both onboard and on
ground-based facilities) have revealed an astonishing diversity in planetary
physical features (i. e. mass and radius), and orbital parameters (e.g. period,
semi-major axis, inclination). Exoplanetary atmospheres provide direct clues to
understand the origin of these differences through their observable spectral
imprints. In the near future, upcoming ground and space-based telescopes will
shift the focus of exoplanetary science from an era of 'species discovery' to
one of 'atmospheric characterization'. In this context, the Atmospheric
Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large (Ariel) survey, will play a key role.
As it is designed to observe and characterize a large and diverse sample of
exoplanets, Ariel will provide constraints on a wide gamut of atmospheric
properties allowing us to extract much more information than has been possible
so far (e.g. insights into the planetary formation and evolution processes).
The low resolution spectra obtained with Ariel will probe layers different from
those observed by ground-based high resolution spectroscopy, therefore the
synergy between these two techniques offers a unique opportunity to
understanding the physics of planetary atmospheres. In this paper, we set the
basis for building up a framework to effectively utilise, at near-infrared
wavelengths, high-resolution datasets (analyzed via the cross-correlation
technique) with spectral retrieval analyses based on Ariel low-resolution
spectroscopy. We show preliminary results, using a benchmark object, namely HD
209458 b, addressing the possibility of providing improved constraints on the
temperature structure and molecular/atomic abundances.

huge time resource to search for proper molecules. Therefore, an efficient and
fast search method considering genetic profiles is required for de novo

generative model with genetic algorithm and tree search for cancer samples

self-trained, and value networks, and it generates anticancer molecules based

FasterGTS generated cancer sample-specific molecules with general chemical

procedure, the German Mouse Clinic and similar facilities worldwide have
produced large, uniform data sets of averaged ABR raw data of mutant and

assessed visually by trained staff from series of signal curves of increasing

reduce workload and improve quality and reproducibility, we developed and

which exploits the signal power spectrum and combines random forest sound level

simultaneous segmentation of body composition depicted on computed tomography
(CT) scans for the following tissues: visceral adipose (VAT), subcutaneous
adipose (SAT), intermuscular adipose (IMAT), skeletal muscle (SM), and bone.
  Approach: A cohort of 100 CT scans acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive
(TCIA) was used - 50 whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)-CTs, 25
chest, and 25 abdominal. Five different body compositions were manually
annotated (VAT, SAT, IMAT, SM, and bone). A training-while-annotating strategy
was used for efficiency. The UNet model was trained using the already annotated
cases. Then, this model was used to enable semi-automatic annotation for the
remaining cases. The 10-fold cross-validation method was used to develop and
validate the performance of several convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
including UNet, Recurrent Residual UNet (R2Unet), and UNet++. A 3-D patch
sampling operation was used when training the CNN models. The separately
trained CNN models were tested to see if they could achieve a better
performance than segmenting them jointly. Paired-samples t-test was used to
test for statistical significance.
  Results: Among the three CNN models, UNet demonstrated the best overall
performance in jointly segmenting the five body compositions with a Dice
coefficient of 0.840+/-0.091, 0.908+/-0.067, 0.603+/-0.084, 0.889+/-0.027, and
0.884+/-0.031, and a Jaccard index of 0.734+/-0.119, 0.837+/-0.096,
0.437+/-0.082, 0.800+/-0.042, 0.793+/-0.049, respectively for VAT, SAT, IMAT,
SM, and bone.
  Conclusion: There were no significant differences among the CNN models in
segmenting body composition, but jointly segmenting body compositions achieved
a better performance than segmenting them separately.

areas - the structure and kinematics of stellar populations of the Galaxy,
photometric and dynamical models of galaxies, and models of the dynamical and
physical evolution of galaxies. This synthesis was made with the goal to
understand better the vast topic of the structure and evolution of galaxies.
The main results of the study can be divided into methodical and astronomical.
The methodical results are 1) extrapolation of the mass distribution function
beyond the Sun distance, and the determination of the circular velocity at the
Sun distance from the Galactic centre; 2) conditions of physical correctness of
models are developed, and the generalised exponential model is suggested; 3) a
method has been developed to construct spatial and hydrodynamical models of
stellar systems, using a combination of observational data on populations, and
data on physical evolution of populations. The main astronomical results are -
1) spatial and hydrodynamical models of the Galaxy and the Andromeda galaxy M31
are elaborated in several approximations; 2) the dynamical evolution of the
Galaxy is reconstructed using kinematical characteristics of stellar
populations of different ages; 3) on the basis of stellar evolutionary tracks
and star formation function, a theory of the evolution of galaxies is
elaborated. The basic conclusion of the study is: it is impossible to reproduce
the observed rotation curves of galaxies with known stellar populations.

purely convective, purely acoustic, and mixed convective-acoustic. Standard
collocated density-based numerical schemes for compressible flow are known to
fail at low Mach number due to the incorrect asymptotic scaling of the
artificial diffusion. Previous studies of this class of schemes have shown a
variety of behaviours across the different limits and proposed guidelines for
the design of low-Mach schemes. However, these studies have primarily focused
on specific discretisations and/or only the convective limit.
  In this paper, we review the low-Mach behaviour using the modified equations
- the continuous Euler equations augmented with artificial diffusion terms -
which are representative of a wide range of schemes in this class. By
considering both convective and acoustic effects, we show that three diffusion
scalings naturally arise. Single- and multiple-scale asymptotic analysis of
these scalings shows that many of the important low-Mach features of this class
of schemes can be reproduced in a straightforward manner in the continuous
setting.
  As an example, we show that many existing low-Mach Roe-type finite-volume
schemes match one of these three scalings. Our analysis corroborates previous
analysis of these schemes, and we are able to refine previous guidelines on the
design of low-Mach schemes by including both convective and acoustic effects.
Discrete analysis and numerical examples demonstrate the behaviour of minimal
Roe-type schemes with each of the three scalings for convective, acoustic, and
mixed flows.

list schedulers are not suitable for runtime decision making, particularly when

allowing one to study complex and often directly inaccessible quantum processes
in controllable systems. In this contribution, the notion of a driven Gaussian
quantum walk is introduced. In contrast to typically considered quantum walks
in optical settings, we describe the operation of the walk in terms of a
nonlinear map rather than a unitary operation, e.g., by replacing a
beam-splitter-type coin with a two-mode squeezer, being a process that is
controlled and driven by a pump field. This opens previously unattainable
possibilities for quantum walks that include nonlinear elements as core
components of their operation, vastly extending their range of applications. A
full framework for driven Gaussian quantum walks is developed, including
methods to dynamically characterize nonlinear, quantum, and quantum-nonlinear
effects. Moreover, driven Gaussian quantum walks are compared with their
classically interfering and linear counterparts, which are based on classical
coherence of light rather than quantum superpositions. In particular, the
generation and boost of highly multimode entanglement, squeezing, and other
quantum effects are studied over the duration of the nonlinear walk.
Importantly, we prove the quantumness of the evolution itself, regardless of
the input state. A scheme for an experimental realization is proposed.
Furthermore, nonlinear properties of driven Gaussian quantum walks are
explored, such as amplification that leads to an ever increasing number of
correlated quantum particles, constituting a source of new walkers during the
walk. Therefore, a concept for quantum walks is proposed that leads to -- and
even produces -- directly accessible quantum phenomena, and that renders the
quantum simulation of nonlinear processes possible.

medical images, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to
the expensive pixel-level annotations from experts and the existence of a large
amount of unannotated normal and abnormal image scans. We introduce a
segmentation network that utilizes adversarial learning to partition an image
into two cuts, with one of them falling into a reference distribution provided
by the user. This Adversarial-based Selective Cutting network (ASC-Net) bridges
the two domains of cluster-based deep segmentation and adversarial-based
anomaly/novelty detection algorithms. Our ASC-Net learns from normal and
abnormal medical scans to segment anomalies in medical scans without any masks
for supervision. We evaluate this unsupervised anomly segmentation model on
three public datasets, i.e., BraTS 2019 for brain tumor segmentation, LiTS for
liver lesion segmentation, and MS-SEG 2015 for brain lesion segmentation, and
also on a private dataset for brain tumor segmentation. Compared to existing
methods, our model demonstrates tremendous performance gains in unsupervised
anomaly segmentation tasks. Although there is still room to further improve
performance compared to supervised learning algorithms, the promising
experimental results and interesting observations shed light on building an
unsupervised learning algorithm for medical anomaly identification using
user-defined knowledge.

to safe intelligent transportation systems. We study a centralized framework to
develop a low-complexity, scalable, and practical resource allocation scheme
for dense C-V2X communications. The NP-hard sum-rate maximization resource
allocation problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear non-convex
optimization problem considering both cellular vehicular links (CVLs) and
non-cellular VLs (NCVLs) quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By assuming that
multiple NCVLs can simultaneously reuse a single cellular link (CL), we propose
two low-complexity sub-optimal matching-based algorithms in four steps. The
first two steps provide a channel gain-based CVL priority and CL assignment
followed by an innovative scalable min-max channel-gain-based CVL-NCVL
matching. We propose an analytically proven closed-form fast feasibility check
theorem as the third step. The objective function is transformed into a
difference of convex (DC) form and the power allocation problem is solved
optimally using majorization-minimization (MaMi) method and interior point
methods as the last step. Numerical results verify that our schemes are
scalable and effective for dense C-V2X communications. The low-complexity and
practicality of the proposed schemes for dense cellular networks is also shown.
Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed schemes outperform other methods up

strong reliance on accurate learned models. Specifically, CMBAC learns multiple
estimates of the Q-value function from a set of inaccurate models and uses the
average of the bottom-k estimates -- a conservative estimate -- to optimize the
policy. An appealing feature of CMBAC is that the conservative estimates
effectively encourage the agent to avoid unreliable ""promising actions"" --
whose values are high in only a small fraction of the models. Experiments
demonstrate that CMBAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in

optimal filtering problems. In projection filters, the Kushner--Stratonovich
stochastic partial differential equation that governs the propagation of the
optimal filtering density is projected to a manifold of parametric densities,
resulting in a finite-dimensional stochastic differential equation. Despite the
fact that projection filters are capable of representing complicated
probability densities, their current implementations are limited to Gaussian
family or unidimensional filtering applications. This work considers a
combination of numerical integration and automatic differentiation to construct
projection filter algorithms for more generic problems. Specifically, we
provide a detailed exposition of this combination for the manifold of the
exponential family, and show how to apply the projection filter to
multidimensional cases. We demonstrate numerically that based on comparison to
a finite-difference solution to the Kushner--Stratonovich equation and a
bootstrap particle filter with systematic resampling, the proposed algorithm
retains an accurate approximation of the filtering density while requiring a
comparatively low number of quadrature points. Due to the sparse-grid
integration and automatic differentiation used to calculate the expected values
of the natural statistics and the Fisher metric, the proposed filtering
algorithms are highly scalable. They therefore are suitable to many
applications in which the number of dimensions exceeds the practical limit of
particle filters, but where the Gaussian-approximations are deemed

platforms become diverse, it is necessary to dynamically adapt the patterns of
descriptions generated. The selling point of products is an important type of
product description for which the length should be as short as possible while
still conveying key information. In addition, this kind of product description
should be eye-catching to the readers. Currently, product selling points are
normally written by human experts. Thus, the creation and maintenance of these
contents incur high costs. These costs can be significantly reduced if product
selling points can be automatically generated by machines. In this paper, we
report our experience developing and deploying the Intelligent Online Selling
Point Extraction (IOSPE) system to serve the recommendation system in the
JD.com e-commerce platform. Since July 2020, IOSPE has become a core service
for 62 key categories of products (covering more than 4 million products). So
far, it has generated more than 0.1 billion selling points, thereby
significantly scaling up the selling point creation operation and saving human
labour. These IOSPE generated selling points have increased the click-through
rate (CTR) by 1.89\% and the average duration the customers spent on the
products by more than 2.03\% compared to the previous practice, which are
significant improvements for such a large-scale e-commerce platform.

range between $1150$ and $10000$ {\AA}. At 31 years, this is the first epoch
with coverage over the ultraviolet-to-near-infrared range since 1995. We create
velocity maps of the ejecta in the H$\alpha$, Mg II $\lambda\lambda2796,2804$
and [O I] $\lambda\lambda6302,6366$ (vacuum) emission lines and study their
morphology. All three lines have a similar morphology, but Mg II is blueshifted
by $\sim$1000 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the others and stronger in the northwest.
We also study the evolution of the line fluxes, finding a brightening by a
factor of $\sim$9 since 1999 in Mg II, while the other line fluxes are similar
in 1999 and 2018. We discuss implications for the power sources of emission
lines at late times: thermal excitation due to heating by the X-rays from the
ejecta-ring interaction is found to dominate the ultraviolet Mg II lines, while
the infrared Mg II doublet is powered mainly by Ly$\alpha$ fluorescence. The
X-ray deposition is calculated based on merger models of SN 1987A.
Far-ultraviolet emission lines of H$_2$ are not detected. Finally, we examine
the combined spectrum of recently-discovered hotspots outside the equatorial
ring. Their unresolved Balmer emission lines close to zero velocity are
consistent with the interaction of fast ejecta and a clumpy, slowly moving
outflow. A clump of emission in this spectrum, south of the equatorial ring at
$\sim$1500 km s$^{-1}$, is likely associated with the reverse shock.

  fairness in biometrics","14 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In 2019, the UK's Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the Upper Tribunal
dismissed an asylum appeal basing the decision on the output of a biometric
system, alongside other discrepancies. The fingerprints of the asylum seeker
were found in a biometric database which contradicted the appellant's account.
The Tribunal found this evidence unequivocal and denied the asylum claim.
Nowadays, the proliferation of biometric systems is shaping public debates
around its political, social and ethical implications. Yet whilst concerns
towards the racialised use of this technology for migration control have been
on the rise, investment in the biometrics industry and innovation is increasing
considerably. Moreover, fairness has also been recently adopted by biometrics
to mitigate bias and discrimination on biometrics. However, algorithmic
fairness cannot distribute justice in scenarios which are broken or intended
purpose is to discriminate, such as biometrics deployed at the border.
  In this paper, we offer a critical reading of recent debates about biometric
fairness and show its limitations drawing on research in fairness in machine
learning and critical border studies. Building on previous fairness
demonstrations, we prove that biometric fairness criteria are mathematically
mutually exclusive. Then, the paper moves on illustrating empirically that a
fair biometric system is not possible by reproducing experiments from previous
works. Finally, we discuss the politics of fairness in biometrics by situating
the debate at the border. We claim that bias and error rates have different
impact on citizens and asylum seekers. Fairness has overshadowed the elephant
in the room of biometrics, focusing on the demographic biases and ethical
discourses of algorithms rather than examine how these systems reproduce
historical and political injustices.

learning environments. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a crucial part of that system.
It is about inferring the skill mastery of students and predicting their
performance to adjust the curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning-based KT models
have shown significant predictive performance compared with traditional models.
However, it is difficult to extract psychologically meaningful explanations
from the tens of thousands of parameters in neural networks, that would relate
to cognitive theory. There are several ways to achieve high accuracy in student
performance prediction but diagnostic and prognostic reasoning is more critical
in learning sciences. Since KT problem has few observable features (problem ID
and student's correctness at each practice), we extract meaningful latent
features from students' response data by using machine learning and data mining
techniques. In this work, we present Interpretable Knowledge Tracing (IKT), a
simple model that relies on three meaningful latent features: individual skill
mastery, ability profile (learning transfer across skills), and problem
difficulty. IKT's prediction of future student performance is made using a
Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier (TAN), therefore its predictions are
easier to explain than deep learning-based student models. IKT also shows
better student performance prediction than deep learning-based student models
without requiring a huge amount of parameters. We conduct ablation studies on
each feature to examine their contribution to student performance prediction.
Thus, IKT has great potential for providing adaptive and personalized
instructions with causal reasoning in real-world educational systems.

represent significant natural hazards. Understanding their complex dynamics is
hence a key concern for risk assessment. In the present work, we report
experiments on the collapse of quasi-two-dimensional dry granular columns under
the effect of gravity, where both the velocity at which the grains are released
and the aspect ratio of the column are varied to investigate the dynamics of
the falling grains. At high release velocity, classical power laws for the
final deposit are recovered, meaning those are representative of a free-fall
like regime. For high enough aspect ratios, the top of the column undergoes an
overall free-fall like motion. In addition, for all experiments, the falling
grains also spread horizontally in a free-fall like motion, and the
characteristic time of spreading is related to the horizontal extension reached
by the deposit at all altitudes. At low release velocity, a quasi-static state
is observed, with scaling laws for the final geometry identical to those of the
viscous regime of granular-fluid flow. The velocity at which the grains are
released governs the collapse dynamics. Between these two asymptotic regimes,
the higher the release velocity, the smaller the impact on the collapse
dynamics. The criterion $\overline{V} \geq 0.4\sqrt{gH_0}$, where $H_0$ is the
initial height of the column, is found for the mean release velocity
$\overline{V}$ not to influence the granular collapse.

prove that two linear layers with ReLU activation function can recover any tree
backbone from any two nonzero, linearly independent starting backbones. This
implies that a Transformer can learn tree structures well in theory. We conduct
experiments with synthetic data and find that the standard Transformer achieves
similar accuracy compared to a Transformer where tree position information is
explicitly encoded, albeit with slower convergence. This confirms empirically
that Transformers can learn tree structures.

on few-shot text classification tasks demonstrate that ALP enhances many

into the train-val splitting methodologies when a data augmentation method
comes into play. We argue empirically that the traditional splitting of

describe groups of graphs: Given a set of graphs and a partition of these
graphs into groups, discover what graphs in one group have in common, how they
systematically differ from graphs in other groups, and how multiple groups of
graphs are related. We refer to this task as graph group analysis, which seeks
to describe similarities and differences between graph groups by means of
statistically significant subgraphs. To perform graph group analysis, we
introduce Gragra, which uses maximum entropy modeling to identify a
non-redundant set of subgraphs with statistically significant associations to
one or more graph groups. Through an extensive set of experiments on a wide
range of synthetic and real-world graph groups, we confirm that Gragra works
well in practice.

and population-based adaptive optimization. In this paper, a pathfinding
strategy is proposed to improve the efficiency of path planning for a broad
range of applications. This study aims to investigate the effect of PSO
parameters (numbers of particle, weight constant, particle constant, and global
constant) on algorithm performance to give solution paths. Increasing the PSO
parameters makes the swarm move faster to the target point but takes a long
time to converge because of too many random movements, and vice versa. From a
variety of simulations with different parameters, the PSO algorithm is proven
to be able to provide a solution path in a space with obstacles.

bistable subsystems that are each driven by one subthreshold logic input
signal, in the presence of a noise floor. The synchronization state of their
outputs, robustly maps to 2-input logic operations of the driving signals, in
an optimal window of noise and coupling strengths. Thus the interplay of noise,
nonlinearity and coupling, leads to the emergence of logic operations embedded
within the collective state of the coupled system. This idea is manifested
using both numerical simulations and proof-of-principle circuit experiments.
The regions in parameter space that yield reliable logic operations were
characterized through a stringent measure of reliability, using both numerical

cybersecurity, social media, etc., datasets used for inducing classification
models often have an unequal distribution of the instances of each class. This
situation, known as imbalanced data classification, causes low predictive
performance for the minority class examples. Thus, the prediction model is
unreliable although the overall model accuracy can be acceptable. Oversampling
and undersampling techniques are well-known strategies to deal with this
problem by balancing the number of examples of each class. However, their
effectiveness depends on several factors mainly related to data intrinsic
characteristics, such as imbalance ratio, dataset size and dimensionality,
overlapping between classes or borderline examples. In this work, the impact of
these factors is analyzed through a comprehensive comparative study involving
40 datasets from different application areas. The objective is to obtain models
for automatic selection of the best resampling strategy for any dataset based
on its characteristics. These models allow us to check several factors
simultaneously considering a wide range of values since they are induced from
very varied datasets that cover a broad spectrum of conditions. This differs
from most studies that focus on the individual analysis of the characteristics
or cover a small range of values. In addition, the study encompasses both basic
and advanced resampling strategies that are evaluated by means of eight
different performance metrics, including new measures specifically designed for
imbalanced data classification. The general nature of the proposal allows the
choice of the most appropriate method regardless of the domain, avoiding the
search for special purpose techniques that could be valid for the target data.

  Subspaces for Computing the Degree of Order","17 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As Christopher Alexander discovered, all space or matter - either organic or
inorganic - has some degree of order in it according to its structure and
arrangement. The order refers to a kind of structural character, called living
structure, which is defined as a mathematical structure that consists of
numerous substructures with an inherent hierarchy. Across the hierarchy, there
are far more small substructures than large ones, while on each level of the
hierarchy the substructures are more or less similar in size. In this paper we
develop a new approach to representing geographic space as a hierarchy of
recursively defined subspaces for computing the degree of order. A geographic
space is first represented as a hierarchy of recursively defined subspaces, and
all the subspaces are then topologically represented as a network for computing
the degree of order of the geographic space, as well as that of its subspaces.
Unlike conventional geographic representations, which are mechanical in nature,
this new geographic representation is organic, conceived, and developed under
the third view of space; that is, space is neither lifeless nor neutral, but a
living structure capable of being more living or less living. Thus, the order
can also be referred to as life, beauty, coherence, or harmony. We applied the
new representation to three urban environments, 253 patterns, and 35
black-white strips to verify it and to demonstrate advantages of the new
approach and the new kind of order. We further discuss the implications of the
approach and the order on geographic information science and sustainable urban
planning.

recent years, to an expansion in research and investment in automated content
analysis tools. Scrutiny of automated content analysis has accelerated during
the COVID-19 pandemic, as social networking services have placed a greater
reliance on these tools due to concerns about health risks to their moderation
staff from in-person work. At the same time, there are important policy debates
around the world about how to improve content moderation while protecting free

understand the potential role of automated content analysis tools.
  This paper explains the capabilities and limitations of tools for analyzing
online multimedia content and highlights the potential risks of using these
tools at scale without accounting for their limitations. It focuses on two main
categories of tools: matching models and computer prediction models. Matching
models include cryptographic and perceptual hashing, which compare
user-generated content with existing and known content. Predictive models
(including computer vision and computer audition) are machine learning
techniques that aim to identify characteristics of new or previously unknown

application stack running on costly physical single-purpose servers are
affected by significant problems of resource management, computing power
distribution, and scalability.Such implementation is restricting applications
to be reduced to smaller, independent services that can be more easily
deployed, managed, and scaled dynamically; therefore, embellishing
environmental uniformity across development, testing, and production. Current
cloud-based infrastructure frequently runs on containers placed in Kubernetes
or Docker-based cluster, and the system configuration is considerably different
compared to the environment prevailed with common virtualizations. This paper
discusses the usage of GraalVM, a polyglot high-performance virtual machine for
JVM-based and other languages, combined with new Kubernetes native Java
tailored stacked framework named Quarkus, formed from enhanced Java libraries.
Moreover, our research explores GraalVMs creation of native images using
Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation and Quarkus deployment to Kubernetes.
Furthermore, we examined the architectures of given systems, various

analytical solution for maximum entropy of RPS and its corresponding PMF

to illustrate the maximum entropy RPS. The results show that the maximum

maximum entropy of RPS will degenerate into the maximum Deng entropy. When each
permutation event is limited to containing just one element, the maximum
entropy of RPS will degenerate into the maximum Shannon entropy.
