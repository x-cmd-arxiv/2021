  Datasets with Dependent Tuples","8 pages, 7 figures",,,,"q-bio.GN cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Motivation: Cutting the cost of DNA sequencing technology led to a quantum
leap in the availability of genomic data. While sharing genomic data across
researchers is an essential driver of advances in health and biomedical
research, the sharing process is often infeasible due to data privacy concerns.
Differential privacy is one of the rigorous mechanisms utilized to facilitate
the sharing of aggregate statistics from genomic datasets without disclosing
any private individual-level data. However, differential privacy can still
divulge sensitive information about the dataset participants due to the
correlation between dataset tuples. Results: Here, we propose GenShare model
built upon Laplace-perturbation-mechanism-based DP to introduce a
privacy-preserving query-answering sharing model for statistical genomic
datasets that include dependency due to the inherent correlations between
genomes of individuals (i.e., family ties). We demonstrate our privacy
improvement over the state-of-the-art approaches for a range of practical
queries including cohort discovery, minor allele frequency, and chi^2
association tests. With a fine-grained analysis of sensitivity in the Laplace
perturbation mechanism and considering joint distributions, GenShare results
near-achieve the formal privacy guarantees permitted by the theory of
differential privacy as the queries that computed over independent tuples (only
up to 6% differences). GenShare ensures that query results are as accurate as
theoretically guaranteed by differential privacy. For empowering the advances
in different scientific and medical research areas, GenShare presents a path
toward an interactive genomic data sharing system when the datasets include
participants with familial relationships.

audio of a pop song? This is the audio-to-symbolic arrangement problem we
tackle in this paper. A good arrangement model should not only consider the
audio content but also have prior knowledge of piano composition (so that the
generation ""sounds like"" the audio and meanwhile maintains musicality). To this
end, we contribute a cross-modal representation-learning model, which 1)
extracts chord and melodic information from the audio, and 2) learns texture
representation from both audio and a corrupted ground truth arrangement. We
further introduce a tailored training strategy that gradually shifts the source
of texture information from corrupted score to audio. In the end, the
score-based texture posterior is reduced to a standard normal distribution, and
only audio is needed for inference. Experiments show that our model captures
major audio information and outperforms baselines in generation quality.

improves network calibration, robustness and strengthens privacy. We use linear
layers with token-consistent stochastic parameters inside the multilayer
perceptron blocks, without altering the architecture of the transformer. The
stochastic parameters are sampled from the uniform distribution, both during
training and inference. The applied linear operations preserve the topological
structure, formed by the set of tokens passing through the shared multilayer
perceptron. This operation encourages the learning of the recognition task to
rely on the topological structures of the tokens, instead of their values,
which in turn offers the desired robustness and privacy of the visual features.
The effectiveness of the token-consistent stochasticity is demonstrated on
three different applications, namely, network calibration, adversarial

established baselines.

independent GEV models at the grid box level, our models pull information from
neighbouring grid boxes for more efficient parameter estimation. The GEV
location and scale parameters are allowed to vary in time using the log of
atmospheric CO2 as a covariate. Changes are detected most strongly in the GEV
location parameter with the TXx distributions generally shifting towards hotter
temperatures. Averaged across our spatial domain, the 100-year return level of
TXx based on the 2018 climate is approximately 2{\deg}C hotter than that based
on the 1950 climate. Moreover, also averaging across our spatial domain, the
100-year return level of TXx based on the 1950 climate corresponds
approximately to a 6-year return level in the 2018 climate.

Virgo cluster carried on at the CFHT with MegaCam, we discovered a long diffuse
tail of ionised gas in the edge-on late-type galaxy NGC 4330. This peculiar
feature witnesses an ongoing ram pressure stripping (RPS) event able to remove
the gas in the outer disc region. Tuned hydrodynamic simulations suggest that
the RPS event is occurring almost face-on, making NGC 4330 the ideal candidate
to study the effects of the perturbation in the direction perpendicular to the
disc plane. We present here two new independent sets of Fabry-Perot
observations (R$\simeq$10000) in order to understand the effects of the RPS
process on the ionised gas kinematics. Despite their limited sensitivity to the
diffuse gas emission, the data allowed us to measure the velocity and the
velocity dispersion fields over the galaxy disc and in several features at the
edges or outside the stellar disc formed after the RPS event. We have
constructed the position-velocity diagrams and the rotation curves of the
galaxy using three different techniques. The data show, consistent with the
hydrodynamic simulations, that the galaxy has an inner solid-body rotation up
to $\sim$2.4 kpc, with non-circular streaming motions outwards the disc and in
the several external features formed during the interaction of the galaxy with
the surrounding intracluster medium. The data also indicate a decrease of the
rotational velocity of the gas with increasing distance from the galaxy disc
along the tails, suggesting a gradual but not linear loss of angular momentum
in the stripped gas. Consistent with a RPS scenario, the $i$-band image shows a
boxy shape at the southwest edge of the disc, where the stellar orbits might
have been perturbed by the modification of the gravitational potential well of
the galaxy due to the displacement of the gas in the $z$-direction.

in regular arrays may show emergent photonic or electronic behavior, and once

Tailoring substrate properties to control nucleation is therefore a powerful
tool for designing functional thin films and nanomaterials. Here, we examine
nucleation control for metals deposited on two-dimensional (2D) materials in a
situation where substrate effects are absent and heterogeneous nucleation sites
are minimized. Through quantification of faceted, epitaxial Au island
nucleation on graphene, we show that ultra-low nucleation densities with nuclei
several micrometers apart can be achieved on suspended graphene under
conditions where we measure the nucleation density to be 2-3 orders of
magnitude higher on the adjacent supported substrate. We estimate diffusion
distances using nucleation theory and find a strong sensitivity of nucleation
and diffusion to suspended graphene thickness. We suggest that nucleation site
density control via substrate tuning may act as a platform for applications
where non-lithographic patterning of metals on graphene is beneficial.

realization of multiple diverse EM functionalities with incident wave

multi-functional metasurfaces relies on massive full-wave EM numerical
simulations to obtain an optimized solution. This article proposes a
step-by-step procedure based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
(cGANs) integrated with Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) to reduce the
computational time required for the EM simulations in the inverse design of
multifunctional microwave metasurfaces. The proposed procedure initially
implements GAFs to encode the desired multi-objective scattering parameters to
images and then passes them through the cGAN model to map them to three-layer
metasurfaces. The present study uses a robust dataset with a wide range of
values and designs, including 54,000 metasurface structures and corresponding

presents a case study example using a multi-functional metasurface with three

of the proposed procedure in the inverse design of multi-functional microwave

cosmology, we test the correction introduced by a time variation of the
Newton's constant, predicted by scalar-tensor theories, on the SNe distance
modulus relation. We find that for induced gravity the coupling parameter is
constrained from $\xi < 0.0095$ (95\% CL) using Pantheon SNe data alone down to
$\xi < 0.00063$ (95\% CL) in combination with {\em Planck} data release DR3 and
a compilation of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from BOSS

cosmological parameters coming from the addition of SNe data to cosmic
microwave background (CMB) and BAO measurements is limited, $\sim7\%$ on the
95\% CL upper bound on $\xi$. Allowing for the value of the gravitational
constant today to depart from the Newton constant, we find that the addition of
SNe further tightens the constraints obtained by CMB and BAO data on the
standard cosmological parameters and by 22\% on the coupling parameter, i.e.,
$\xi < 0.00064$ at 95\% CL. We finally show that in this class of modified
gravity models the use a prior on the absolute magnitude $M_B$ in combination
with the Pantheon SNe sample leads to results which are very consistent with
those obtained by imposing a prior on $H_0$, as happens for other {\em

However, quantization inevitably leads to a distribution divergence from the

issue, massive efforts have been made, but most existing approaches lack
statistical considerations and depend on several manual configurations. In this
paper, we present an adaptive-mapping quantization method to learn an optimal
latent sub-distribution that is inherent within models and smoothly
approximated with a concrete Gaussian Mixture (GM). In particular, the network
weights are projected in compliance with the GM-approximated sub-distribution.
This sub-distribution evolves along with the weight update in a co-tuning
schema guided by the direct task-objective optimization. Sufficient experiments
on image classification and object detection over various modern architectures
demonstrate the effectiveness, generalization property, and transferability of
the proposed method. Besides, an efficient deployment flow for the mobile CPU
is developed, achieving up to 7.46$\times$ inference acceleration on an

that occur in a broad range of systems (including living matter) is extremely
important, as it can provide information on the physical and chemical
characteristics of particles' surroundings. In recent years, an ever-growing
number of methods have been proposed to overcome some of the limitations of the
mean-squared displacements approach to tracer diffusion. In March 2020, the
Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge was launched by a community of
international scientists to provide a framework for an objective comparison of
the available methods for anomalous diffusion. In this paper, we introduce a
feature-based machine learning method developed in response to Task 2 of the
challenge, i.e. the classification of different types of diffusion. We discuss
two sets of attributes that may be used for the classification of
single-particle tracking data. The first one was proposed as our contribution
to the AnDi Challenge. The latter is the result of our attempt to improve the
performance of the classifier after the deadline of the competition. Extreme
gradient boosting was used as the classification model. Although the
deep-learning approach constitutes the state-of-the-art technology for data
classification in many domains, we deliberately decided to pick this
traditional machine learning algorithm due to its superior interpretability.
After the extension of the feature set our classifier achieved the accuracy of
0.83, which is comparable with the top methods based on neural networks.

  Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-21)",,,,"cs.GT cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the problem of estimating preferences of human agents from data
of strategic systems where the agents repeatedly interact. Recently, it was
demonstrated that a new estimation method called ""quantal regret"" produces more
accurate estimates for human agents than the classic approach that assumes that
agents are rational and reach a Nash equilibrium; however, this method has not
been compared to methods that take into account behavioral aspects of human
play. In this paper we leverage equilibrium concepts from behavioral economics
for this purpose and ask how well they perform compared to the quantal regret
and Nash equilibrium methods. We develop four estimation methods based on
established behavioral equilibrium models to infer the utilities of human
agents from observed data of normal-form games. The equilibrium models we study
are quantal-response equilibrium, action-sampling equilibrium, payoff-sampling
equilibrium, and impulse-balance equilibrium. We show that in some of these
concepts the inference is achieved analytically via closed formulas, while in
the others the inference is achieved only algorithmically. We use experimental
data of 2x2 games to evaluate the estimation success of these behavioral
equilibrium methods. The results show that the estimates they produce are more
accurate than the estimates of the Nash equilibrium. The comparison with the
quantal-regret method shows that the behavioral methods have better hit rates,
but the quantal-regret method performs better in terms of the overall mean
squared error, and we discuss the differences between the methods.

these relations can be defined from another one using only 3 variables. Our
four-variable definitions use only one universal and one existential

important benchmark for testing new computational techniques. In the present
paper, the classical Kapteyn series solution of Kepler's equation originally
conceived by Lagrange and Bessel will be revisited from a different
perspective, offered by the relatively new and still largely unexplored
framework of the so-called nonlinear sequence transformations.
  The main scope of the paper is to provide numerical evidences supporting the
fact that the Kapteyn series solution of Kepler's equation could be a Stieltjes
series. To support such a conjecture, two types of Levin-type sequence
transformations, namely Levin $d$- and Weniger $\delta$-transformations, will
be employed to sum up several wildly divergent series derived by the Debye
representation of Bessel functions. As an interesting byproduct of this
analysis, an effective recursive algorithm to generate arbitrarily higher-order
Debye's polynomials will be developed.
  Such a ""Stieltjeness"" conjecture will also be numerically validated by
directly employing the Levin-type transformations to accelerate the complex
Kapteyn series solution of the Kepler equation. Both $d$- and $\delta$-
transformations display exponential convergence, whose rate will be numerically
estimated. A few conclusive words, together with some hints for future
extensions in the direction of more general class of Kapteyn series, eventually
close the paper.

because experimentation is expensive, and observational data lacks random
variation. This paper identifies a pervasive source of naturally occurring,
quasi-experimental variation in user-level ad-exposure in digital advertising
campaigns. It shows how this variation can be utilized by ad-publishers to
identify the causal effect of advertising campaigns. The variation pertains to
auction throttling, a probabilistic method of budget pacing that is widely used
to spread an ad-campaign`s budget over its deployed duration, so that the
campaign`s budget is not exceeded or overly concentrated in any one period. The
throttling mechanism is implemented by computing a participation probability
based on the campaign`s budget spending rate and then including the campaign in
a random subset of available ad-auctions each period according to this
probability. We show that access to logged-participation probabilities enables
identifying the local average treatment effect (LATE) in the ad-campaign. We
present a new estimator that leverages this identification strategy and outline
a bootstrap procedure for quantifying its variability. We apply our method to
real-world ad-campaign data from an e-commerce advertising platform, which uses
such throttling for budget pacing. We show our estimate is statistically
different from estimates derived using other standard observational methods

attracted a surge of interest lately mainly due to the recent advancements of
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Conventional Model-Based (MB) or Model-Free (MF)
RL algorithms are not directly applicable to the MARL problems due to
utilization of a fixed reward model for learning the underlying value function.
While DNN-based solutions perform utterly well when a single agent is involved,
such methods fail to fully generalize to the complexities of MARL problems. In
other words, although recently developed approaches based on DNNs for
multi-agent environments have achieved superior performance, they are still
prone to overfiting, high sensitivity to parameter selection, and sample
inefficiency. The paper proposes the Multi-Agent Adaptive Kalman Temporal
Difference (MAK-TD) framework and its Successor Representation-based variant,
referred to as the MAK-SR. Intuitively speaking, the main objective is to
capitalize on unique characteristics of Kalman Filtering (KF) such as
uncertainty modeling and online second order learning. The proposed MAK-TD/SR
frameworks consider the continuous nature of the action-space that is
associated with high dimensional multi-agent environments and exploit Kalman
Temporal Difference (KTD) to address the parameter uncertainty. By leveraging
the KTD framework, SR learning procedure is modeled into a filtering problem,
where Radial Basis Function (RBF) estimators are used to encode the continuous
space into feature vectors. On the other hand, for learning localized reward
functions, we resort to Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE), to deal with
the lack of prior knowledge on the observation noise covariance and observation
mapping function. The proposed MAK-TD/SR frameworks are evaluated via several
experiments, which are implemented through the OpenAI Gym MARL benchmarks.

modifications of general relativity in the teleparallel framework break a
certain notion of local Lorentz invariance, which is present in the pure tetrad

First, the re-uploading strategy is a variational algorithm related to machine
learning. It consists in introducing data several times along a computation
accompanied by tunable parameters. This process permits the circuit to learn
and mimic any behavior. This capability emerges naturally from the quantum
properties of the circuit. Second, the unary strategy aims to reduce the
density of information stored in a quantum circuit to increase its resilience
against noise. This trade-off between performance and robustness brings an
advantage for noisy devices, where small but meaningful quantum speed-ups can
be found.

the intensity values is required during registration and better spatial
resolution with finer and sharper structures can improve the resampling

algorithmic technique targeting at spatial resolution enhancement which can
achieve an image resolution beyond the hardware limitation. In this work, we
consider SR as a preprocessing technique and present a CNN-based resolution
enhancement module (REM) which can be easily plugged into the registration
network in a cascaded manner. Different residual schemes and network
configurations of REM are investigated to obtain an effective architecture
design of REM. In fact, REM is not confined to image registration, it can also
be straightforwardly integrated into other vision tasks for enhanced
resolution. The proposed REM is thoroughly evaluated for deformable
registration on medical images quantitatively and qualitatively at different
upscaling factors. Experiments on LPBA40 brain MRI dataset demonstrate that REM
not only improves the registration accuracy, especially when the input images
suffer from degraded spatial resolution, but also generates resolution enhanced
images which can be exploited for successive diagnosis.

Interface-invariant reduced models are natural to graph-based model reduction

due to its simplicity in design and effectiveness in controlling a wide range

extensive domain knowledge and field experience. To address the issue, this
work proposes an automatic PID tuning framework based on reinforcement learning
(RL), particularly the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) method. Different
from existing studies on using RL for PID tuning, in this work, we consider the
closed-loop stability throughout the RL-based tuning process. In particular, we
propose a novel episodic tuning framework that allows for an episodic
closed-loop operation under selected PID parameters where the actor and critic
networks are updated once at the end of each episode. To ensure the closed-loop
stability during the tuning, we initialize the training with a conservative but
stable baseline PID controller and the resultant reward is used as a benchmark
score. A supervisor mechanism is used to monitor the running reward (e.g.,
tracking error) at each step in the episode. As soon as the running reward
exceeds the benchmark score, the underlying controller is replaced by the
baseline controller as an early correction to prevent instability. Moreover, we
use layer normalization to standardize the input to each layer in actor and
critic networks to overcome the issue of policy saturation at action bounds, to
ensure the convergence to the optimum. The developed methods are validated
through setpoint tracking experiments on a second-order plus dead-time system.
Simulation results show that with our scheme, the closed-loop stability can be
maintained throughout RL explorations and the explored PID parameters by the RL
agent converge quickly to the optimum.

been used in various other works to measure their own progress in robustness

robustness research. We build off of simple baselines in the form of Maximum
Logit, and Typicality Score as well as create a novel data augmentation method

Maximum Logit considers the logit values instead of the values after the
softmax operation, while a small change produces noticeable improvements. The
Typicality Score compares the output distribution to a posterior distribution
over classes. We show that this improves performance over the baseline in all

that there does not exist a universal codimension two cycle on the product of a
very general cubic threefold and the Prym variety associated to it. Hence we
conclude that a very general cubic threefold is stably irrational.

On the basis of the hierarchical IFGF interpolation strategy, the proposed
(hybrid MPI-OpenMP) parallel implementation results in highly efficient data
communication, and it exhibits in practice excellent parallel scaling up to
large numbers of cores - without any hard limitations on the number of cores
concurrently employed with high efficiency. Moreover, on any given number of
cores, the proposed parallel approach preserves the O(N log N) computing cost
inherent in the sequential version of the IFGF algorithm. Unlike other
approaches, the IFGF method does not utilize the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT),
and it is thus better suited than other methods for efficient parallelization
in distributed-memory computer systems. In particular, the IFGF method relies
on a ""peer-to-peer"" strategy wherein, at every level, field propagation is
directly enacted via ""exchanges"" between ""peer"" polynomials of low and constant
degree, without data accumulation in large-scale ""telephone-central""
mathematical constructs such as those in the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) or

excellent weak and strong parallel scaling properties in all cases considered -

This results in a non-linear Hamiltonian for the electron system. Interaction
with a thermal environment is included by solving the Lindblad equation for the

for therapeutic purposes or of other irregularly shaped specimens calls for
refinements of experimental methodology to satisfy experimental challenges.
Encapsulation in capsules remains the method of choice, but its applicability
in precise magnetometry is limited. This is particularly true for minute
specimens in the single milligram range as they are outweighed by the capsules
and are subject to large alignment errors. We present here a completely new
experimental methodology that permits 30-fold in situ reduction of the signal
of capsules by substantially restoring the symmetry of the sample holder that
is otherwise broken by the presence of the capsule. In practical terms it means
that the standard 30 mg capsule is seen by the magnetometer as approximately a
1 mg object, effectively opening the window for precise magnetometry of single
milligram specimens. The method is shown to work down to 1.8 K and in the whole
range of the magnetic fields. The method is demonstrated and validated using
the reciprocal space option of MPMS-SQUID magnetometers; however, it can be
easily incorporated in any magnetometer that can accommodate straw sample
holders (i.e., the VSM-SQUID). Importantly, the improved sensitivity is
accomplished relying only on the standard accessories and data reduction method

The new exact solution of the Schr\""odinger equation is analyzed from the
perspective of quantum mechanics in the phase space. It is the phase space,
which has been extensively used recently in quantum computing, quantum
informatics and communications, that is the bridge towards classical physics,
where understanding of physical reality is still possible. In this paper, an
interpretation of time-dependent processes of energy redistribution in a
quantum system, probability waves, the temperature and entropy of a quantum

Sampling Reinforcement Learning (CSRL), incorporates prior domain knowledge as

their observed performance, to adaptively switch among them. We instantiate our

physics, necessarily restricting when and which logic may be admissible. And
one may understand why that path is hardly followed in the literature. The
mathematics/formalism of quantum, compared with classical, physics, may be
fairly basically characterized by non-commutative algebras replacing
commutative. These classically appearing, in fact, in dealing with systems of
possibilities (say, all possible planetary motions under gravity of which one
is the actual one). In particular, contrary to too common usage, the quantum
non-commutativity should make it impossible to simply `transcend' the `system
of possibilities' aspect into a `yes-no' logic essential for an `actual world'.
One may have the latter only in a `haven' of approximately commutative algebras

charge mainly through the triboelectric effect during separation from their
housings and, if in the space environment, from cosmic radiation. These charges
will degrade the accuracy of high sensitivity accelerometers and drag-free
sensors. We demonstrate in ground testing two passive bipolar charge management
systems using photoelectrons emitted from Au coated surfaces under illumination
by UV-LEDs of 255 nm, 275 nm, and 295 nm central wavelength. The first method
uses fast photoelectrons, generated by two 255 nm UV-LEDs with
adjustable-intensity (through fine-tuning of their excitation currents) and
illuminating the TM and its housing respectively. A second technique uses slow
photoelectrons generated by one UV LED, of either 275 nm or 295 nm, located on
the TM housing. Fast and slow electrons are defined as having kinetic energies
after photoemission above and below the maximum allowable potential above
ground, VTMmax, required for normal operation of the TM. In their optimized
configurations and following a 10 to 30 sec exposure to UV with initial TM
potentials of between -3 V and 3 V, both control systems converge to a TM
potential of about 10 mV with a drift of about 2 mV/day. For reference, VTMmax
is about 100mV for the LISA and LISA pathfinder sensors. Insight into the slow
photoelectrons charge control method is provided by our simple gaussian model
of the distribution of the photoemission sites of Au films: 4.6 eV center, 0.2
eV standard deviation, and 4.30 eV and 4.90 eV cutoffs. The lowest energy
photoemission is obtained with the 295 nm LED at about 4.35 eV or 285 nm;
equivalent to 2.5 times the standard deviation from its center wavelength and
at 4% of its maximum intensity.

challenging, especially for a reinforcement learning agent with sequential

information about the state of the environment, the agent must learn the agent
state based on the data stream of experience. We refer to the state learned
directly from the data stream of experience as the agent state. Recurrent
neural networks can learn the agent state, but the training methods are
computationally expensive and sensitive to the hyper-parameters, making them
unideal for online learning. This work introduces methods based on the
generate-and-test approach to learn the agent state. A generate-and-test
algorithm searches for state features by generating features and testing their
usefulness. In this process, features useful for the agent's performance on the
task are preserved, and the least useful features get replaced with newly
generated features. We study the effectiveness of our methods on two online
multi-step prediction problems. The first problem, trace conditioning, focuses
on the agent's ability to remember a cue for a prediction multiple steps into
the future. In the second problem, trace patterning, the agent needs to learn

considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a
continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this
interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information
loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete
lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.
From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information
loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a
vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a
general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings
support the observation that the selection of feature representations that
attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but
this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal
is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some
structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative
notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in
the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.

general relativistic shock waves. The construction resolves the open problem of
determining the expanding waves created behind a shock-wave explosion into a
static isothermal sphere with an inverse square density and pressure profile.
The construction involves matching two self-similar families of solutions to
the perfect fluid Einstein field equations across a spherical shock surface.
The matching is accomplished in Schwarzschild coordinates where the shock waves
appear one derivative less regular than they actually are. Separately, both
families contain singularities, but as matched shock-wave solutions, they are
singularity free. There was no guarantee ahead of time that the matching of the
two families could be achieved within the regions where both families are
nonsingular. Indeed, for pure radiation equations of state, the matching occurs
near the sonic point of the interior expanding wave and this makes the analysis
quite delicate, both numerically and formally. It is for this reason the
construction is accompanied by a rigorous existence proof in the pure radiation
case. The analysis is extended to demonstrate Lax stability in the pure
radiation case and provide a criterion for Lax stability in all other cases.
These shock-wave solutions represent an intriguing new mechanism in General
Relativity for exhibiting accelerations in asymptotically Friedmann spacetimes,
analogous to the accelerations modelled by the cosmological constant in the
Standard Model of Cosmology. However, unlike in the Standard Model of
Cosmology, these shock-wave solutions solve the Einstein field equations in the
absence of a cosmological constant, opening up the question of whether a purely
mathematical mechanism could account for the cosmic acceleration observed
today, rather than dark energy.

as a Bayesian prediction error. Equivalently, its negative is a lower bound on
Bayesian model evidence (a.k.a., marginal likelihood). In short, certain random
dynamical systems evince a kind of self-evidencing. Here, we reformulate the
FEP in the formal setting of spacetime-background free, scale-free quantum
information theory. We show how generic quantum systems can be regarded as
observers, which with the standard freedom of choice assumption become agents
capable of assigning semantics to observational outcomes. We show how such
agents minimize Bayesian prediction error in environments characterized by
uncertainty, insufficient learning, and quantum contextuality. We show that in
its quantum-theoretic formulation, the FEP is asymptotically equivalent to the
Principle of Unitarity. Based on these results, we suggest that biological

physical origins underlying the observed trends. Dominant defects in the
lead-iodide compounds are the A$^+$ cation interstitials (A = Cs, MA, FA),
charge-compensated by I$^-$ interstitials or lead $({2-})$ vacancies. In the
lead-bromide and -chloride compounds, halide vacancies become relatively more
prominent, and for MAPbBr$_3$, the Pb$^{2+}$ interstitial also becomes
important. The trends can be explained in terms of the changes in electrostatic
interactions and chemical bonding upon replacing cations and anions. Defect
physics in MASnI$_3$ is strongly dominated by tin $({2-})$ vacancies, promoted
by the easy oxidation of the tin perovskite. Intrinsically, all compounds are
mildly p-doped, except for MASnI$_3$, which is strongly p-doped. All acceptor

halide vacancies and Pb or Sn interstitials in particular, create deep donor

obtained using the developed app. The simulations investigate the effects of
different factors on COVID-19 transmission in Durham Region, including
vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness, waning of vaccine-induced
immunity, advent of the Omicron variant and effect of COVID-19 booster vaccines
in reducing the number of infections and severe cases. Results indicate that,
for the Delta variant, natural immunity, in addition to vaccination-induced
immunity, is necessary to achieve herd immunity and that waning of
vaccine-induced immunity lengthens the time necessary to reach herd immunity.
In the absence of additional public health measures, a wave driven by the
Omicron variant is predicted to pose significant public health challenges with
infections predicted to peak in approximately two to three months, depending on
the rate of administration of booster doses.

oxygen-flame propagation until the onset of core collapse. We perform
axisymmetric simulations with 6 progenitor models that, at the time of
collapse, span a range of propagating flame front radii. For comparison, we
also perform a simulation with the same setup using the canonical,
spherically-symmetrical progenitor model n8.8. We found that the variations in
the progenitor models inherited from simulations of stellar evolution and flame
propagation do not significantly alter the global properties of the
neutrino-driven ECSN explosion, such as the explosion energy
($\sim1.36$-$1.48\times10^{50}$ erg) and the mass ($\sim0.017$-$0.018M_\odot$)
and composition of the ejecta. Due to aspherical perturbations induced by the
2D flame, the ejecta contains a small amount
($\lesssim1.8\times10^{-3}~M_\odot$) of low-$Y_e$ ($0.35<Y_e<0.4$) component.
The baryonic mass of the protoneutron star is $\sim1.34~M_\odot$
($\sim1.357~M_\odot$) with the new (n8.8) progenitor models when simulations
end at $\sim400$ ms and the discrepancy is due to updated weak-interaction
rates in the progenitor evolutionary simulations. Our results reflect the
nature of ECSN progenitors containing a strongly degenerate ONeMg core and
suggest a standardized ECSN explosion initialized by ONeMg core collapse.
Moreover, we carry out a rudimentary three-dimensional simulation and find that
the explosion properties are fairly compatible with the 2D counterpart. Our
paper facilitates a more thorough understanding of ECSN explosions following
the ONeMg core collapse, though more three-dimensional simulations are still
needed.

considerations of age groups dependence and random cohort effects parameters.
The proposed model can disclose more mortality data information and provide a
natural quantification of the model parameters uncertainties with no

The abilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated through two
applications with empirical male and female mortality data. The proposed

in optimal control and the discrete adjoint system, Numer. Math.,2000, pp.
247-282], direct approach with RK discretization is equivalent with indirect
approach based on symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta (SPRK) integration. In
this paper, we will reconstruct this equivalence by the analogue of continuous
and discrete dynamic programming. Then, based on the equivalence, we discuss
the issue that the internal-stage controls produced by direct approach may have
lower order accuracy than the RK method used. We propose order conditions for
internal-stage controls and then demonstrate that third or fourth order
explicit RK discretization cannot avoid the order reduction phenomenon. To
overcome this obstacle, we calculate node control instead of internal-stage
controls in DLQR and ILQR methods. And numerical examples will illustrate the
validity of our methods. Another advantage of our methods is high computational
efficiency which comes from the usage of feedback technique. In this paper, we
also demonstrate that ILQR is essentially a quasi-Newton method with linear
convergence rate.

solutions for continuous and cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring. In this
regard, a robust deep learning-based framework is proposed for computation of
low latency, continuous, and calibration-free upper and lower bounds on the
systolic and diastolic BP. Method: Referred to as the BP-Net, the proposed
framework is a novel convolutional architecture that provides longer effective
memory while achieving superior performance due to incorporation of casual
dialated convolutions and residual connections. To utilize the real potential
of deep learning in extraction of intrinsic features (deep features) and
enhance the long-term robustness, the BP-Net uses raw Electrocardiograph (ECG)
and Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals without extraction of any form of
hand-crafted features as it is common in existing solutions. Results: By
capitalizing on the fact that datasets used in recent literature are not
unified and properly defined, a benchmark dataset is constructed from the
MIMIC-I and MIMIC-III databases obtained from PhysioNet. The proposed BP-Net is
evaluated based on this benchmark dataset demonstrating promising performance
and shows superior generalizable capacity. Conclusion: The proposed BP-Net
architecture is more accurate than canonical recurrent networks and enhances
the long-term robustness of the BP estimation task. Significance: The proposed
BP-Net architecture addresses key drawbacks of existing BP estimation
solutions, i.e., relying heavily on extraction of hand-crafted features, such
as pulse arrival time (PAT), and; Lack of robustness. Finally, the constructed
BP-Net dataset provides a unified base for evaluation and comparison of deep

measured on multiple outcomes, researchers often apply a multiple testing
procedure (such as Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg) to adjust $p$-values. Such
an adjustment reduces the likelihood of spurious findings, but also changes the
statistical power, sometimes substantially, which reduces the probability of
detecting effects when they do exist. However, this consideration is frequently
ignored in typical power analyses, as existing tools do not easily accommodate
the use of multiple testing procedures. We introduce the PUMP R package as a
tool for analysts to estimate statistical power, minimum detectable effect
size, and sample size requirements for multi-level RCTs with multiple outcomes.
Multiple outcomes are accounted for in two ways. First, power estimates from
PUMP properly account for the adjustment in $p$-values from applying a multiple
testing procedure. Second, as researchers change their focus from one outcome
to multiple outcomes, different definitions of statistical power emerge. PUMP
allows researchers to consider a variety of definitions of power, as some may
be more appropriate for the goals of their study. The package estimates power
for frequentist multi-level mixed effects models, and supports a variety of
commonly-used RCT designs and models and multiple testing procedures. In
addition to the main functionality of estimating power, minimum detectable
effect size, and sample size requirements, the package allows the user to
easily explore sensitivity of these quantities to changes in underlying
assumptions.

assumed to be constant through time. However, asteroid break-up events in the
main belt may have been responsible for cratering spikes over the last ~2 Ga on
the Earth-Moon system. We investigate here the possible variations of the size
frequency distributions of impactors from the record of small craters of 521
martian impact craters larger than 20 km in diameter. We show that 49 craters
(out of the 521) correspond to the complete crater population of this size
formed over the last 600 Ma. Our results on Mars show that the flux of both
small (> 5 m) and large asteroids (> 1 km) are coupled, does not vary between
each other over the last 600 Ma. Existing data sets for large craters on the
Earth and the Moon are analyzed and compared to our results on Mars. On Earth,
we infer the formation location of a set of impact craters thanks to plate
tectonic reconstruction and show that a cluster of craters formed during the
Ordovician period, about 470 Ma ago, appears to be a preservation bias. On the
Moon, the late increase seen in the crater age signal can be due to the
uncertain calibration method used to date those impacts (i.e. rock abundance in
lunar impact ejecta), and other calibrations are consistent with a constant
crater production rate. We conclude to a coupling of the crater production rate
between kilometer-size craters and down to ~100 m in diameter in the inner
Solar System. This is consistent with the traditional model for delivering
asteroids to planet-crossing orbits: the Yarkovsky effect slowly pushes the
large debris from asteroid break-ups towards orbital resonances while smaller
debris are grinded through collisional cascades. This suggests that the
influence of past asteroid break-ups in the cratering rate for D > 100 m is
limited or inexistent.

Our model is trained end-to-end from data and is capable of learning a range of

our simpler, general-purpose architecture outperforms various more specialized,

downsampling solves this problem. We also find that while generalization beyond
the training distribution is a challenge for learned models, training noise,
added loss constraints, and dataset augmentation can help. Broadly, we conclude
that our learned simulator outperforms traditional solvers run on coarser

generalization.

attracted appealing attention as it deals with distilling valuable knowledge
from well-trained models without requiring to access to the training data. In
particular, it mainly consists of the data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD)
and source data-free domain adaptation (SFDA). On the one hand, DFKD aims to
transfer the intra-domain knowledge of original data from a cumbersome teacher
network to a compact student network for model compression and efficient
inference. On the other hand, the goal of SFDA is to reuse the cross-domain
knowledge stored in a well-trained source model and adapt it to a target

RIS-aided communications, acquiring accurate channel state information is
crucial, which however is very challenging. For RIS-aided multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) communications, the existing channel estimation methods
have computational complexity growing rapidly with the number of RIS units $N$
(e.g., in the order of $N^2$ or $N^3$) and/or have special requirements on the
matrices involved (e.g., the matrices need to be sparse for algorithm
convergence to achieve satisfactory performance), which hinder their
applications. In this work, instead of using the conventional signal model in
the literature, we derive a new signal model obtained through proper
vectorization and reduction operations. Then, leveraging the unitary
approximate message passing (UAMP), we develop a more efficient channel
estimator that has complexity linear with $N$ and does not have special
requirements on the relevant matrices, thanks to the robustness of UAMP. These
facilitate the applications of the proposed algorithm to a general RIS-aided
MIMO system with a larger $N$. Moreover, extensive numerical results show that
the proposed estimator delivers much better performance and/or requires
significantly less number of training symbols, thereby leading to notable
reductions in both training overhead and latency.

feature interactions in user's event sequence for better detection performance.
However, existing popular solutions usually suffer two key issues: 1) only
focusing on feature interactions and failing to capture the sequence influence;
2) only focusing on sequence information, but ignoring internal feature
relations of each event, thus failing to extract a better event representation.
In this paper, we consider a two-level structure for capturing the hierarchical
information over user's event sequence: 1) learning effective feature
interactions based event representation; 2) modeling the sequence
representation of user's historical events. Experimental results on both
industrial and public datasets clearly demonstrate that our model achieves
significantly better performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

the presence of intradot Coulomb interactions, a plateau in the
thermo-particle, the heat, and the energy currents is seen. The current plateau
diminishes at a high thermal bias between the leads. It is shown that the
Pauli, the Redfield, the Lindblad-type equation with first order tunneling
rates, and first-order von-Neumann master equations give very similar thermal
transport indicating the conservation of coherency in the electron transport in
sequential tunneling between the QD and leads. In contrast, the thermal
transport is suppressed when coutuneling processes are taken into account via a
second-order von-Neumann master equation. The consideration of second order
effects with respect to the QD-leads coupling brings in a wealth of virtual
processes at the contact to each lead. These virtual processes directly weaken
the effects of the contribution of the first order direct processes to the
overall transport, and introduce important other aspects of the transport, as
level broadening, energy shifts, and lifetimes in the time-domain. As a result
the current plateau formed via the Coulomb interaction diminishes, when second

studied analytically. Leveraging a dispersive hydrodynamic description, the
Landau-Lifshitz equation is recast in terms of hydrodynamic-like variables for
the magnetization's perpendicular component (spin density) and azimuthal phase
gradient (fluid velocity). Spin injection acts as a moving piston that
generates nonlinear, dynamical spin textures in the ferromagnetic channel with
downstream quiescent spin density set by the external field. In contrast to the
classical problem of a piston accelerating a compressible gas, here, variable
spin injection and field lead to a rich variety of nonlinear wave phenomena
from oscillatory spin shocks to solitons and rarefaction waves. A full
classification of solutions is provided using nonlinear wave modulation theory
by identifying two key aspects of the fluid-like dynamics: subsonic/supersonic
conditions and convex/nonconvex hydrodynamic flux. Familiar waveforms from the
classical piston problem such as rarefaction (expansion) waves and shocks
manifest in their spin-based counterparts as smooth and highly oscillatory
transitions, respectively. The spin shock is an example of a dispersive shock
wave, which arises in many physical systems. New features without a gas
dynamics counterpart include composite wave complexes with ""contact"" spin
shocks and rarefactions. Magnetic supersonic conditions lead to two pronounced
piston edge behaviors including a stationary soliton and an oscillatory
wavetrain. These coherent wave structures have physical implications for the
generation of high frequency spin waves from pulsed injection and persistent,
stable stationary and/or propagating solitons in the presence of magnetic
damping. The analytical results are favorably compared with numerical

  Assuming nominal design parameters, simulations show that for a bunched beam,
the bulk of emittance growth takes place immediately following injection,
typically within tens of turns. We attempt to account for this growth using a
simplified RMS mismatch theory; some of its limitations and possible
improvements are briefly discussed. We then compare theoretical predictions to

center of the nonlinear (octupole) insertion region where $\beta_x = \beta_y$.
To observe how nonlinearity affects emittance growth and whether it dominates
growth due to mismatch, we track two different distributions. Finally, we
explore the potential of using octupoles in a quasi-integrable configuration to
mitigate growth using a variety of initial distributions both at reduced and

We employ the positivity preserving variational scheme for a bounded and stable

stresses, the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor is convected at each time
step to trace the evolution of the solid strain in the Eulerian reference

coarsening step to the last non-linear iteration while simultaneously ensuring
convergence properties of the coupled governing equations. We perform a

Frazier","Bayesian Optimization of Function Networks","In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021",,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider Bayesian optimization of the output of a network of functions,
where each function takes as input the output of its parent nodes, and where
the network takes significant time to evaluate. Such problems arise, for
example, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing.
While the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final
output, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging
information that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network.
This is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes
and choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the
expected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the
objective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents
computing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be
efficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove
that our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally
optimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus
generalizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement.
Notably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain
densely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored.
Finally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian
optimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.

candidates for various applications and can provide accurate absolute energy
calculations in structure-based methods. QM methods are powerful tools for
describing reaction pathways and their potential energy surfaces (PESs). In
this study, we applied quantum computing to describe the PES of the bimolecular
nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction between chloromethane and chloride
ions. We performed noiseless and noise simulations using quantum algorithms and
compared the accuracy and noise effects of the ansatzes. In noiseless
simulations, the results from UCCSD and k-UpCCGSD are similar to those of full
configurational interaction (FCI) with the same active space, which indicates
that quantum algorithms can describe the PES of the SN2 reaction. In noise
simulations, UCCSD is more susceptible to quantum noise than k-UpCCGSD.
Therefore, k-UpCCGSD can serve as an alternative to UCCSD to reduce quantum
noisy effects in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, and k-UpCCGSD is
sufficient to describe the PES of the SN2 reaction in this work. The results
showed the applicability of quantum computing to the SN2 reaction pathway and
provided valuable information for structure-based molecular simulations with

subfield of symbolic artificial intelligence, plays a promising role in
generating interpretable explanations because of its intuitive logic-driven
framework. ILP effectively leverages abductive reasoning to generate

achieves consistent improvements over the baseline on music smoothness and

our model has shown the capability of multimodality on frame-level actors'

DistDGLv2, a system that extends DistDGL for training GNNs on massive
heterogeneous graphs in a mini-batch fashion, using distributed hybrid CPU/GPU

mini-batch computation in GPUs. For ease of use, DistDGLv2 adopts API
compatible with Deep Graph Library (DGL)'s mini-batch training and
heterogeneous graph API, which enables distributed training with almost no code
modification. To ensure model accuracy, DistDGLv2 follows a synchronous
training approach and allows ego-networks forming mini-batches to include
non-local vertices. To ensure data locality and load balancing, DistDGLv2
partitions heterogeneous graphs by using a multi-level partitioning algorithm
with min-edge cut and multiple balancing constraints. DistDGLv2 deploys an
asynchronous mini-batch generation pipeline that makes computation and data
access asynchronous to fully utilize all hardware (CPU, GPU, network, PCIe).
The combination allows DistDGLv2 to train high-quality models while achieving
high parallel efficiency and memory scalability. We demonstrate DistDGLv2 on

vehicles. In this task, the correct camera pose is the key to generating
accurate lanes, which can transform an image from perspective-view to the
top-view. With this transformation, we can get rid of the perspective effects
so that 3D lanes would look similar and can accurately be fitted by low-order
polynomials. However, mainstream 3D lane detectors rely on perfect camera poses
provided by other sensors, which is expensive and encounters multi-sensor
calibration issues. To overcome this problem, we propose to predict 3D lanes by
estimating camera pose from a single image with a two-stage framework. The
first stage aims at the camera pose task from perspective-view images. To
improve pose estimation, we introduce an auxiliary 3D lane task and geometry
constraints to benefit from multi-task learning, which enhances consistencies
between 3D and 2D, as well as compatibility in the above two tasks. The second
stage targets the 3D lane task. It uses previously estimated pose to generate
top-view images containing distance-invariant lane appearances for predicting
accurate 3D lanes. Experiments demonstrate that, without ground truth camera
pose, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art perfect-camera-pose-based

short sessions given that user profiles are invisible in various scenarios
nowadays, such as e-commerce and short video recommendation. There is a common
scenario that user specifies a target category of items as a global filter,
however previous SBR settings mainly consider the item sequence and overlook
the rich target category information. Therefore, we define a new task called
Category-aware Session-Based Recommendation (CSBR), focusing on the above
scenario, in which the user-specified category can be efficiently utilized by
the recommendation system. To address the challenges of the proposed task, we
develop a novel method called Intention Adaptive Graph Neural Network (IAGNN),
which takes advantage of relationship between items and their categories to
achieve an accurate recommendation result. Specifically, we construct a
category-aware graph with both item and category nodes to represent the complex
transition information in the session. An intention-adaptive graph neural
network on the category-aware graph is utilized to capture user intention by
transferring the historical interaction information to the user-specified
category domain. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets are
conducted to show our IAGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the

Bernardinelli-Bernstein has been announced. Its cometary activity beyond Uranus
orbit also has refreshed interest in similar objects, including C/2017K2
PanSTARRS. Another peculiarity of these objects is the long interval of
positional data, taken at large heliocentric distances. These two comets are
suitable candidates for a detailed investigation of their long-term motion
outside the planetary zone. Using the selected orbital solutions, we aim at
estimating the orbital parameters of their orbits at the previous perihelion
passage. This might allow us to discriminate between dynamically old and new
comets. To follow the dynamical evolution of long-period comets far outside the
planetary zone, it is necessary to take into account both the perturbation
caused by the overall Galactic gravitational potential and the actions of
individual stars appearing in the solar neighborhood. To this aim, we applied
the recently published methods based on stellar perturbers ephemerides. For
C/2014 UN271 we obtained a precise orbital solution that can be propagated to
the past and to the future. For C/2017 K2 we have to limit ourselves to study
only the past motion since some signs of nongravitational effects can be found
in recent positional observations. Therefore, we use a specially selected
orbital solution suitable for past motion studies. Using these starting orbits,
we propagated both comets to their previous perihelia. We also investigated the
future motion of C/2014 UN271. Orbital evolution of these two comets appears to
be sensitive to perturbations from several stars that closely approach the Sun.
Unfortunately, some of these stars have 6D data with uncertainties too large to
obtain definitive results for the studied comets; however, it appears that both
comets were probably outside the planetary zone in the previous perihelion.

narrow band systems under flat fading. However, little is known about massive
grant-free access for wideband systems under frequency-selective fading. This
paper investigates massive grant-free access in a wideband system under
frequency-selective fading. First, we present an orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM)-based massive grant-free access scheme. Then, we propose
two different but equivalent models for the received pilot signal, which are
essential for designing various device activity detection and channel
estimation methods for OFDM-based massive grant-free access. One directly
models the received signal for actual devices, whereas the other can be
interpreted as a signal model for virtual devices. Next, we investigate
statistical device activity detection under frequency-selective Rayleigh fading
based on the two signal models. We first model device activities as unknown
deterministic quantities and propose three maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation-based device activity detection methods with different detection
accuracies and computation times. We also model device activities as random
variables with a known joint distribution and propose three maximum a posterior
probability (MAP) estimation-based device activity methods, which further
enhance the accuracies of the corresponding ML estimation-based methods.
Optimization techniques and matrix analysis are applied in designing and
analyzing these methods. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed
statistical device activity detection methods outperform existing
state-of-the-art device activity detection methods under frequency-selective
Rayleigh fading.

trained on paired data to retrieve original signals upon 2D compressed
measurements given by a particular optical hardware mask in CASSI, during which
the mask largely impacts the reconstruction performance and could work as a
""model hyperparameter"" governing on data augmentations. This mask-specific
training style will lead to a hardware miscalibration issue, which sets up
barriers to deploying deep HSI models among different hardware and noisy

propose a novel Graph-based Self-Tuning (GST) network to reason uncertainties
adapting to varying spatial structures of masks among different hardware.
Moreover, we develop a bilevel optimization framework to balance HSI

challenge. The aim of this challenge was to predict the number and size of
wildfires over the contiguous US between 1993 and 2015, with more importance
placed on extreme events. In the data set provided, over 14\% of both wildfire
count and burnt area observations are missing; the objective of the data
challenge was to estimate a range of marginal probabilities from the
distribution functions of these missing observations. To enable this
prediction, we make the assumption that the marginal distribution of a missing
observation can be informed using non-missing data from neighbouring locations.
In our method, we select spatial neighbourhoods for each missing observation
and fit marginal models to non-missing observations in these regions. For the
wildfire counts, we assume the compiled data sets follow a zero-inflated
negative binomial distribution, while for burnt area values, we model the bulk
and tail of each compiled data set using non-parametric and parametric
techniques, respectively. Cross validation is used to select tuning parameters,
and the resulting predictions are shown to significantly outperform the
benchmark method proposed in the challenge outline. We conclude with a
discussion of our modelling framework, and evaluate ways in which it could be
extended.

between the two can be found for randomly generated global states, for those
with additional structure like weighted graph states we find that local discord
is indicative of global multipartite entanglement. Global states that admit
efficient classical descriptions like stabilizer states furnish an exception in
which despite multipartite entanglement, nonclassical correlation is absent in
two qubit subsystems. We discuss these results in the context of mixed state

average the erratic behavior of the fast microscopic variables. Here, we
identify a similar separation of scales occurring in fully trained finitely

DNNs, these kernels are inert, while for finite ones they adapt to the data and

SISR in recent years. On the one hand, residual connections and dense
connections have been used widely to ease forward information and backward
gradient flows to boost performance. However, current methods use residual
connections and dense connections separately in most network layers in a
sub-optimal way. On the other hand, although various networks and methods have
been designed to improve computation efficiency, save parameters, or utilize
training data of multiple scale factors for each other to boost performance, it
either do super-resolution in HR space to have a high computation cost or can
not share parameters between models of different scale factors to save
parameters and inference time. To tackle these challenges, we propose an
efficient single image super-resolution network using dual path connections
with multiple scale learning named as EMSRDPN. By introducing dual path
connections inspired by Dual Path Networks into EMSRDPN, it uses residual
connections and dense connections in an integrated way in most network layers.
Dual path connections have the benefits of both reusing common features of
residual connections and exploring new features of dense connections to learn a
good representation for SISR. To utilize the feature correlation of multiple
scale factors, EMSRDPN shares all network units in LR space between different
scale factors to learn shared features and only uses a separate reconstruction
unit for each scale factor, which can utilize training data of multiple scale
factors to help each other to boost performance, meanwhile which can save
parameters and support shared inference for multiple scale factors to improve
efficiency. Experiments show EMSRDPN achieves better performance and comparable
or even better parameter and inference efficiency over SOTA methods.

discrete Regge gravity, we will illustrate that it can also answer the first

variables and study its analytical continuation. Although there have been
previously two different versions defined for the Lorentzian Regge action, we

different definitions for the action one arrives at equivalent analytical
extensions. The difference between the two Lorentzian versions is only realized
along branch cuts which arise for a certain class of causality violating
configurations.

while the conventional head loss is named external. The latter is obtained
experimentally, while the first cannot. This fact seems to push back reaching a

However the internal model needs three: two `pure' head loss coefficients and a

this paper, we develop a unified framework that describes variations of GMRL
algorithms and points out that existing stochastic meta-gradient estimators
adopted by GMRL are actually \textbf{biased}. Such meta-gradient bias comes
from two sources: 1) the compositional bias incurred by the two-level problem
structure, which has an upper bound of
$\mathcal{O}\big(K\alpha^{K}\hat{\sigma}_{\text{In}}|\tau|^{-0.5}\big)$
\emph{w.r.t.} inner-loop update step $K$, learning rate $\alpha$, estimate
variance $\hat{\sigma}^{2}_{\text{In}}$ and sample size $|\tau|$, and 2) the
multi-step Hessian estimation bias $\hat{\Delta}_{H}$ due to the use of
autodiff, which has a polynomial impact
$\mathcal{O}\big((K-1)(\hat{\Delta}_{H})^{K-1}\big)$ on the meta-gradient bias.
We study tabular MDPs empirically and offer quantitative evidence that
testifies our theoretical findings on existing stochastic meta-gradient
estimators. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

low-bias estimator can help fix the gradient bias for GMRL algorithms in

small part of the data of the past tasks as a memory buffer to prevent models

learning different new tasks. Such a setting lacks the consideration of the
relationship/similarity between past and new tasks. For example, the previous
knowledge/features learned from dogs are more beneficial for the identification
of cats (new task), compared to those learned from buses. In this regard, we

tasks.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel contrastive
regression framework to address the disjoint annotations problem, where each
sample is labeled by only one annotator and multiple annotators work on
disjoint subsets of the data. To take account of both the intra-annotator
consistency and inter-annotator inconsistency, two strategies are
employed.Firstly, a contrastive-based loss is applied to learn the relative
ranking among different samples of the same annotator, with the assumption that
the ranking of samples from the same annotator is unanimous. Secondly, we apply
the gradient reversal layer to learn robust representations that are invariant
to different annotators. Experiments on the facial expression prediction task,
as well as the image quality assessment task, verify the effectiveness of our
proposed framework.

instabilities that concentrate dust into self-gravitating clumps. Triggering
these instabilities requires the prior pileup of dust in the protoplanetary
disk. Until now, this has been successfully modeled exclusively at the disk's
snowline, whereas rocky planetesimals in the inner disk were obtained only by
assuming either unrealistically large particle sizes or an enhanced global disk
metallicity. However, planetesimal formation solely at the snowline is
difficult to reconcile with the early and contemporaneous formation of iron
meteorite parent bodies with distinct oxidation states and isotopic
compositions, indicating formation at different radial locations in the disk.
Here, by modeling the evolution of a disk with ongoing accretion of material
from the collapsing molecular cloud, we show that planetesimal formation may
have been triggered within the first 0.5 million years by dust pileup at both
the snowline (at approximately 5 au) and the silicate sublimation line (at
approximately 1 au), provided turbulent diffusion was low. Particle
concentration at approximately 1 au is due to the early outward radial motion
of gas and is assisted by the sublimation and recondensation of silicates. Our
results indicate that, although the planetesimals at the two locations formed
about contemporaneously, those at the snowline accreted a large fraction of
their mass (approximately 60 percent) from materials delivered to the disk in
the first few 10,000 yr, whereas this fraction is only 30 percent for the
planetesimals formed at the silicate line. Thus, provided that the isotopic
composition of the delivered material changed with time, these two planetesimal
populations should have distinct isotopic compositions, consistent with
observations.

first discretize in space the periodic initial-value problem with a

studied numerically in several ways. The numerical generation is analyzed by
approximating the ode system with periodic boundary conditions for the

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To resolve these difficulties,
sophisticated pilot designs have been conceived for the family of
energy-efficient hybrid analog-digital (HAD) beamforming architecture relying
on adaptive-resolution analog-to-digital converters (RADCs). In this paper, we
jointly optimize the pilot sequences, the number of RADC quantization bits and
the hybrid receiver combiner in the uplink of multiuser massive MIMO systems.
We solve the associated mean square error (MSE) minimization problem of channel
estimation in the context of correlated Rayleigh fading channels subject to
practical constraints. The associated mixed-integer problem is quite
challenging due to the nonconvex nature of the objective function and of the
constraints. By relying on advanced fractional programming (FP) techniques, we
first recast the original problem into a more tractable yet equivalent form,
which allows the decoupling of the fractional objective function. We then
conceive a pair of novel algorithms for solving the resultant problems for
codebook-based and codebook-free pilot schemes, respectively. To reduce the
design complexity, we also propose a simplified algorithm for the
codebook-based pilot scheme. Our simulation results confirm the superiority of
the proposed algorithms over the relevant state-of-the-art benchmark schemes.

suppressing cavity noise by a factor of 20-30. The second order Doppler shift
causes a shift in the lasing frequency on the order of 500 Hz. For the cold
atom beam we account for decoherence and thermal effects when using a repumping
scheme for atoms confined in a dipole guide. We find that the output power is

addition to providing data essential to the simulation of energy loss
processes, the electron spectrum also provides information important in the
simulation of plasma processes. These simulations will then provide an insight
on the starting potential. Here, a Monte Carlo approach is used to model the
electron spectrum in the source for a given magnetic and electric field
configuration. The spectrum is evaluated at different positions within the
WGTS, which allows for a direct analysis of the spectrum close to the rear wall
and detector end of the experiment. Alongside electrons, also ions are tracked
by the simulation, resulting in a full description of the currents in the
source.

great importance in many robotic and autonomous driving applications. This
fundamental perception task is still very challenging due to (i) significant
deformations of human body pose and gesture over time and (ii) point cloud
sparsity and scarcity for pedestrian class objects. Recent efficient 3D object
detection approaches rely on pillar features to detect objects from point cloud
data. However, these pillar features do not carry sufficient expressive
representations to deal with all the aforementioned challenges in detecting
people. To address this shortcoming, we first introduce a stackable Pillar
Aware Attention (PAA) module for enhanced pillar features extraction while
suppressing noises in the point clouds. By integrating
multi-point-channel-pooling, point-wise, channel-wise, and task-aware attention
into a simple module, the representation capabilities are boosted while
requiring little additional computing resources. We also present Mini-BiFPN, a
small yet effective feature network that creates bidirectional information flow
and multi-level cross-scale feature fusion to better integrate multi-resolution
features. Our proposed framework, namely PiFeNet, has been evaluated on three
popular large-scale datasets for 3D pedestrian Detection, i.e. KITTI, JRDB, and
nuScenes achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on KITTI Bird-eye-view

inference speed of 26 frame-per-second (FPS), making it a real-time detector.

thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this
field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and
therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first
section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of
intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and
empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of
research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to
developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First,
neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global
workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological
plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social
theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to
over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third,
embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of
communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference,
which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological
realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.

in the conventional dual quantum dot set-up, demand an asymmetric step-like
system-to-reservoir coupling around the ground states for optimal operation
(Physica E, 114, 113635, 2019). In addition to such demand for unrealistic
coupling, the sensitivity in such a strategy also depends on the average
measurement terminal temperature, which may result in erroneous temperature
assessment. In this paper, I propose non-local current based thermometry in the
dual dot set-up as a practical alternative and demonstrate that in the regime
of high bias, the sensitivity remains robust against fluctuations of the
measurement terminal temperature. Proceeding further, I propose a non-local
triple quantum dot thermometer, that provides an enhanced sensitivity while
bypassing the demand for unrealistic step-like system-to-reservoir coupling and
being robust against fabrication induced variability in Coulomb coupling. In
addition, I show that the heat extracted from (to) the target reservoir, in the
triple dot design, can also be suppressed drastically by appropriate
fabrication strategy, to prevent thermometry induced drift in reservoir
temperature. The proposed triple dot setup thus offers a multitude of benefits
and could potentially pave the path towards the practical realization and

semilinear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) with the distinctive feature of
predicting the propagation of ultrasound waves at \textit{finite} speed due to
heat phenomenon know as \textit{second sound} which leads to the hyperbolic
character of heat propagation. In practice, the JMGT dynamics is largely used
for modeling the evolution of the acoustic velocity and, most importantly, the
acoustic pressure as sound waves propagate through certain media. %Due to its
sensitivity to different media, such model (or similar) is often used for
medical/engineering treatments such as lithotripsy, thermotherapy,

cannot be relied upon for stabilization purposes. In this paper the issue of
boundary stabilizability of originally unstable (JMGT) equation is resolved.
Motivated by modeling aspects in HIFU technology, boundary feedback is
supported only on a portion of the boundary, while the remaining part of the
boundary is left free (available to control actions) . Since the boundary
conditions imposed on the ""free"" part of the boundary fail to satisfy
Lopatinski condition (unlike Dirichlet boundary conditions), the analysis of

multiparticle entangled Schr\""{o}dinger-cat--states of arbitrary spin-$s$.
Based on quantum probability statistics the GBI and violation are formulated in
an unified manner with the help of state density operator, which can be
separated to local and non-local parts. The local part gives rise to the
inequality, while the non-local part is responsible for the violation. The GBI
is not violated at all by quantum average except the spin-$1/2$ entangled
states. If the measuring outcomes are restricted in the subspace of spin
coherent state (SCS), namely, only the maximum spin values $\pm s$, the GBI is
still meaningful for the incomplete measurement. With the help of SCS quantum
probability statistics, it is proved that the violation of GBI can occur only
for half-integer spins but not integer spins. Moreover, the maximum violation
bound depends on the number parity of entangled particles, that it is $1/2$ for
the odd particle-numbers while $1$ for even numbers.

the cloud by providing computation on encrypted data (ciphertexts). HE is based
on noisy encryption schemes in which noise accumulates as more computations are
applied to the data. The limited number of operations applicable to the data
prevents practical applications from exploiting HE. Bootstrapping enables an
unlimited number of operations or fully HE (FHE) by refreshing the ciphertext.
Unfortunately, bootstrapping requires a significant amount of additional
computation and memory bandwidth as well. Prior works have proposed hardware
accelerators for computation primitives of FHE. However, to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first to propose a hardware FHE accelerator that
supports bootstrapping as a first-class citizen.
  In particular, we propose BTS - Bootstrappable, Technologydriven, Secure
accelerator architecture for FHE. We identify the challenges of supporting
bootstrapping in the accelerator and analyze the off-chip memory bandwidth and
computation required. In particular, given the limitations of modern memory
technology, we identify the HE parameter sets that are efficient for FHE
acceleration. Based on the insights gained from our analysis, we propose BTS,
which effectively exploits the parallelism innate in HE operations by arranging
a massive number of processing elements in a grid. We present the design and
microarchitecture of BTS, including a network-on-chip design that exploits a
deterministic communication pattern. BTS shows 5,556x and 1,306x improved
execution time on ResNet-20 and logistic regression over a CPU, with a chip

each follower node only needs to track its observer's state independently,
without interacting with its neighbors. This paper deliberately introduces
certain coupling effect among follower nodes, such that the follower nodes tend
to converge to each other cooperatively on the way they converge to the leader.
Moreover, by suitably designing the control law, the poles of follower nodes
can be assigned as desired, and thus transient tracking performance can also be
adjusted.

curve when a mechanical loading is applied in alternating directions. This
effect, also known as the Bauschinger effect, is intimately related to the
reversibile part of the plastic deformation and controls the materials damage
and ultimately their failure. In the present work, we associate mesoscale
Dislocation Dynamics simulations and Finite Element simulations to identify two
original dislocation mechanisms at the origin of the traction/compression
asymmetry and quantify their impacts on the cyclic behaviour of FCC
single-crystals. After demonstrating that no long-range internal stresses can
be measured in the simulations, careful analysis of the dislocation network
show that the Bauschinger effect is caused by an asymmetry in the stability of
junctions formed from segments whose curvature is determined by the applied
stress, and a significant portion of the stored dislocation segments is easily
recovered during the backward motion of dislocations in previously explored
regions of the crystal. These mechanisms are incorporated into a modified
crystal plasticity framework with few parameters quantified from statistical
analysis of Dislocation Dynamics simulations or from the literature. This
strategy has a real predictive capability and the macroscale results are in
good agreement with most of the experimental literature existing on the
Bauschinger and cyclic deformation of FCC single-crystals. This work provides
valuable mechanistic insight to assist in the interpretation of experiments and
the design of structural components to consolidate their life under cyclic

the aforementioned challenges is given. For this purpose, we focus on planning

counting. However, as the challenging scale variations and complex scenes
existed in crowds, neither traditional convolution networks nor recent
Transformer architectures with fixed-size attention could handle the task well.
To address this problem, this paper proposes a scene-adaptive attention
network, termed SAANet. First of all, we design a deformable attention in-built
Transformer backbone, which learns adaptive feature representations with
deformable sampling locations and dynamic attention weights. Then we propose
the multi-level feature fusion and count-attentive feature enhancement modules
further, to strengthen feature representation under the global image context.
The learned representations could attend to the foreground and are adaptive to
different scales of crowds. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging crowd counting benchmarks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Especially, our method currently ranks No.1 on
the public leaderboard of the NWPU-Crowd benchmark. We hope our method could be
a strong baseline to support future research in crowd counting. The source code

determining the nature of the magnetic long-range order and how it melts at

anisotropically correlated. This correlated paramagnet exists in a temperature
range $T_N < T < T^\ast$, whose width increases as magnetic frustrations grow.
This intermediate phase is typically characterized by short-range correlations,
however the two-dimensional nature of the model allows for an additional exotic

achieves a target response. This type of task therefore distinguishes itself
from other psychophysical tasks in that the responses are on a continuum and
effort plays an important role with increasing response magnitude. Based on
Bayesian decision theory we present an inference method to recover perceptual
uncertainty, response variability, and the cost function underlying human
responses. Crucially, the cost function is parameterized such that effort is
explicitly included. We present a hybrid inference method employing MCMC
sampling utilizing appropriate proposal distributions and an inner loop
utilizing amortized inference with a neural network that approximates the mode

adapter-based tuning stage. Our model is first pretrained on the source domain
to obtain shared semantic knowledge of log data. Then, we transfer the
pretrained model to the target domain via the adapter-based tuning. The
proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets including one source
domain and two target domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our
simple yet efficient approach, with fewer trainable parameters and lower
training costs in the target domain, achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three benchmarks.

their behaviors in the presence of uncertainties and black-box components that

verifying partially-observable, discrete-time dynamical systems with unmodelled
dynamics against temporal logic specifications from a given input-output
dataset. The verification framework employs Gaussian process (GP) regression to
learn the unknown dynamics from the dataset and abstract the continuous-space
system as a finite-state, uncertain Markov decision process (MDP). This
abstraction relies on space discretization and transition probability intervals
that capture the uncertainty due to the error in GP regression by using
reproducible kernel Hilbert space analysis as well as the uncertainty induced
by discretization. The framework utilizes existing model checking tools for
verification of the uncertain MDP abstraction against a given temporal logic
specification. We establish the correctness of extending the verification
results on the abstraction to the underlying partially-observable system. We
show that the computational complexity of the framework is polynomial in the
size of the dataset and discrete abstraction. The complexity analysis
illustrates a trade-off between the quality of the verification results and the
computational burden to handle larger datasets and finer abstractions. Finally,
we demonstrate the efficacy of our learning and verification framework on
several case studies with linear, nonlinear, and switched dynamical systems.

of grid blocks, which can be computationally demanding and time-consuming to
solve with numerical simulators. Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale
geologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution
grids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to
be effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency
remains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed
to upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve
upscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship
between the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic
heads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while
solving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws
(e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be
incorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed
the theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical
information considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep
learning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are
introduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based

the present article, we will therefore consider the effect of R\'enyi entropy
on Hawking radiation power. We assume that if the effect of R\'enyi entropy is
very small, we suggest that the Hawking radiation should originate from the
quantum atmosphere which extends beyond the black hole's horizon for finite
dimensions. That is, that Giddings' suggestion is the more likely of the above
possibilities. However, for infinite dimensions, both suggestions are equally
credible. We briefly consider the very large effect of R\'enyi entropy on

behaviour of phase-separating battery materials, one can enter (deeply) into
the hysteretic loop in specific, yet realistic, transient operating conditions.
Within the hysteretic loop a (significant) portion of particle population
resides in an intraparticle phase separated state. Interestingly, the
transition to the more conventional interparticle phase separation state found
outside the hysteretic loop is very slow. Further, we establish a direct
interrelation between the intraparticle phase separated electrode state and

AC characteristics of the battery. The experimental evidence of entering the

will not allow the network providers to fulfill the demands of the network's
subscribers in the future. Therefore, this paper will focus on machine
learning, automation, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics for
improving the capacity and effectiveness of next-generation wireless networks.
The paper will discuss the role of these new technologies in improving the
service and performance of the network providers in the future. The paper will
find out that machine learning, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence
will help in making the next-generation wireless network self-adaptive,
self-aware, prescriptive, and proactive. At the end of the paper, it will be
provided that future wireless network operators cannot work without shifting
their operational framework to AI and machine learning technologies.

  $B^{\ast}\bar{B}^{\ast}$ in the Bethe-Salpeter Formalism","34 pages, 6 figures",,,,"hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study the scalar bound states of $D^{\ast}\bar{D}^{\ast}$ and
$B^{\ast}\bar{B}^{\ast}$ in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, with the effective
interaction kernel extracted from the chiral perturbative theory and the heavy
quark effective theory in the ladder approximation and the covariant
instantaneous approximation. The results show that, in the scalar case ($J=0$),
there can only exist $I = 0$ bound states for parameters in proper range, while
there cannot exist the $I = 1$ bound states in the whole reasonable parameter
range, due to more constraints arising from our definition of the
Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction.

signal has developed rapidly in the past decade. RF signals have great
advantages in environmental perception. Wireless signals are transmitted
through the transmitter. With the propagation of these signals in the medium,
they are reflected from different objects and people in space to the receiver.
In this process, rich environmental perception information is carried. These
ubiquitous perceptual information has rich application significance and bright
prospects in the fields of indoor positioning, motion perception, behavior
recognition, human-computer interaction, fall detection, health monitoring,
smart home, search and rescue and so on. This paper will discuss and analyze
the current research results by combing some existing literature and the
research status of relevant researchers in relevant fields at this stage, so as
to understand the future development trend of RF signal based applications.
