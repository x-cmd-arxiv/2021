  Gradient Approximation",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning architecture,
which leverages a large number of remote devices to learn a joint model with
distributed training data. However, the system-heterogeneity is one major
challenge in a FL network to achieve robust distributed learning performance,
which comes from two aspects: i) device-heterogeneity due to the diverse
computational capacity among devices; ii) data-heterogeneity due to the
non-identically distributed data across the network. Prior studies addressing
the heterogeneous FL issue, e.g., FedProx, lack formalization and it remains an
open problem. This work first formalizes the system-heterogeneous FL problem
and proposes a new algorithm, called FedLGA, to address this problem by
bridging the divergence of local model updates via gradient approximation. To
achieve this, FedLGA provides an alternated Hessian estimation method, which
only requires extra linear complexity on the aggregator. Theoretically, we show
that with a device-heterogeneous ratio $\rho$, FedLGA achieves convergence
rates on non-i.i.d. distributed FL training data for the non-convex
optimization problems with $\mathcal{O} \left( \frac{(1+\rho)}{\sqrt{ENT}} +
\frac{1}{T} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O} \left( \frac{(1+\rho)\sqrt{E}}{\sqrt{TK}}
+ \frac{1}{T} \right)$ for full and partial device participation respectively,
where $E$ is the number of local learning epoch, $T$ is the number of total
communication round, $N$ is the total device number and $K$ is the number of
selected device in one communication round under partially participation
scheme. The results of comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets show that
FedLGA outperforms current FL methods against the system-heterogeneity.

already provided excellent tests of gravity. However, despite observational
efforts, a pulsar orbiting a black hole has remained elusive. One possible
explanation is the extreme Doppler smearing caused by the pulsar's orbital
motion which changes its apparent spin frequency during an observation. The
classical solution to this problem has been to assume a constant acceleration
or jerk for the entire observation. However, this assumption breaks down when
the observation samples a large fraction of the orbit. This limits the length
of search observations, and hence their sensitivity. This provides a strong
motivation to develop techniques that can find compact binaries in longer
observations. Here we present a GPU-based radio pulsar search pipeline that can
perform a coherent search for binary pulsars by directly searching over three
or five Keplerian parameters using the template-bank algorithm. We compare the
sensitivity obtained from our pipeline with acceleration and jerk search
pipelines for simulated pulsar-stellar-mass black hole binaries and
observations of PSR J0737-3039A. We also discuss the computational feasibility
of our pipeline for untargeted pulsar surveys and targeted searches. Our
benchmarks indicate that circular orbit searches for P-BH binaries with
spin-period P$_{\rm spin} \geq 20 \rm ms$ covering the 3-10 T$\mathrm{_{obs}}$

Additionally, an elliptical orbit search in Globular clusters for P$_{\rm spin}

unconstrained because of a lack of large homogeneous samples to enable a
statistical analysis of their properties. So far, most FFPs have been
discovered using indirect methods; microlensing surveys have proved
particularly successful to detect these objects down to a few Earth masses.
However, the ephemeral nature of microlensing events prevents any follow-up
observations and individual characterization. Several studies have identified
FFPs in young stellar clusters and the Galactic field but their samples are
small or heterogeneous in age and origin. Here we report the discovery of
between 70 and 170 FFPs (depending on the assumed age) in the region
encompassing Upper Scorpius and Ophiuchus, the closest young OB association to
the Sun. We found an excess of FFPs by a factor of up to seven compared with
core-collapse model predictions, demonstrating that other formation mechanisms
may be at work. We estimate that ejection from planetary systems might have a
contribution comparable to that of core-collapse in the formation of FFPs.
Therefore, ejections due to dynamical instabilities in giant exoplanet systems
must be frequent within the first 10 Myr of a system's life.

struggled to ensure equal female representation. This is likely tied to
implicit gender biases against women in authority. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of gender biases that appear in online political
discussion. To this end, we collect 10 million comments on Reddit in
conversations about male and female politicians, which enables an exhaustive
study of automatic gender bias detection. We address not only misogynistic
language, but also other manifestations of bias, like benevolent sexism in the
form of seemingly positive sentiment and dominance attributed to female
politicians, or differences in descriptor attribution. Finally, we conduct a
multi-faceted study of gender bias towards politicians investigating both
linguistic and extra-linguistic cues. We assess 5 different types of gender
bias, evaluating coverage, combinatorial, nominal, sentimental, and lexical
biases extant in social media language and discourse. Overall, we find that,
contrary to previous research, coverage and sentiment biases suggest equal
public interest in female politicians. Rather than overt hostile or benevolent
sexism, the results of the nominal and lexical analyses suggest this interest
is not as professional or respectful as that expressed about male politicians.
Female politicians are often named by their first names and are described in
relation to their body, clothing, or family; this is a treatment that is not
similarly extended to men. On the now banned far-right subreddits, this
disparity is greatest, though differences in gender biases still appear in the
right and left-leaning subreddits. We release the curated dataset to the public

is a severely ill-posed problem though its visualization is one of the main
research tools in cognitive neuroscience. Here, using an isotropic
multiple-shell model for the geometry of the head and a quasi-static approach
for modeling the electro-magnetic processes, we derive a novel vector-valued
spline method based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The presented vector
spline method follows the path of former spline approaches and provides
classical minimum norm properties. In addition, it minimizes the
(infinite-dimensional) Tikhonov-Philips functional handling the instability of
the inverse problem. This optimization problem reduces to solving a
finite-dimensional system of linear equations without loss of information. It
results in a unique solution which takes into account that only the harmonic
and solenoidal component of the current affects the measurements. Besides, we
prove a convergence result: the solution achieved by the vector spline method
converges to the generator of the data as the number of measurements increases.
The vector splines are applied to the inversion of synthetic test cases, where
the irregularly distributed data situation could be handled very well. Combined
with parameter choice methods, numerical results are shown with and without
additional Gaussian white noise. Former approaches based on scalar splines are
outperformed by the vector splines results with respect to the normalized root
mean square error. Finally, reasonable results with respect to physiological

with different health conditions and various disease severity. When dealing
with raw unlabeled image datasets, the large number of samples often makes it
hard for experts and non-experts to understand the variety of images present in

considerable effort by medical experts to first understand the communities of
images present in the data and then labeling the images. Here, we propose an
algorithm to facilitate the automatic identification of communities in medical
image datasets. We further demonstrate that such analysis can be insightful in
a supervised setting when the images are already labeled. Such insights are
useful because, health and disease severity can be considered a continuous
spectrum, and within each class, there usually are finer communities worthy of
investigation, especially when they have similarities to communities in other
classes. In our approach, we use wavelet decomposition of images in tandem with
spectral methods. We show that the eigenvalues of a graph Laplacian can reveal
the number of notable communities in an image dataset. Moreover, analyzing the
similarities may be used to infer a spectrum representing the severity of the
disease. In our experiments, we use a dataset of images labeled with different

observe that only 6 of those communities contain patients with pneumonia. We

a circular shape and emits/absorbs a solute that diffuses and is advected by
the suspending fluid. Beyond a certain emission/absorption rate (characterized
by a dimensionless P\'eclet number, $Pe$) the particle is known to undergo a
bifurcation from a non motile to a motile state, with different trajectories,
going from a straight to circular and to a chaotic motion by progressively
increasing $Pe$. From the full model involving solute diffusion and advection,
we derive a reduced closed model which involves only two time-dependent
amplitudes $C_1(t)$ and $C_2(t)$ corresponding to the first two Fourier modes
of the solute concentration field. This model consists of two coupled nonlinear
ordinary differential equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$ and presents several great
advantages:(i) the straight and circular motions can be handled fully
analytically, (ii) complex motions such as chaos can be analyzed numerically
very efficiently in comparison to the numerically expensive full model
involving partial differential equations, (iii) the reduced model has a
universal form dictated only by symmetries, (iv) the model can be extended to
higher Fourier modes. The derivation method is exemplified for a 2D model, for
simplicity, but can easily be extended to 3D, not only for the presently
selected phoretic model, but also for any model in which chemical activity
triggers locomotion. A typical example can be found, for example, in the field
of cell motility involving acto-myosin kinetics. This strategy offers an
interesting way to cope with swimmers on the basis of ordinary differential

loss function, called HardNeg, for learning a local image descriptor that
relies on hard negative mining within a mini-batch and on the maximization of
the distance between the closest positive and the closest negative patches.
(ii) The descriptor trained with the HardNeg loss, called HardNet, is compact

and retrieval benchmarks. (iii) A method for learning the affine shape,
orientation, and potentially other parameters related to geometric and
appearance properties of local features. (iv) A tentative correspondences

superior to the standard method, is applicable to either hard-engineered
descriptors like SIFT, LIOP, and MROGH or deeply learned like HardNet. (v) A

technique to 'fingerprint' molecules via their internal bonds and symmetries.
Since Raman scattering is weak, methods to enhance, direct and harness it are
highly desirable, e.g. through the use of optical cavities, waveguides, and
surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). While SERS offers dramatic
enhancements by localizing light within vanishingly small 'hot-spots' in
metallic nanostructures, these tiny interaction volumes are only sensitive to
few molecules, yielding weak signals that are difficult to detect. Here, we
show that SERS from 4-Aminothiophenol (4-ATP) molecules bonded to a plasmonic
gap waveguide is directed into a single mode with >99% efficiency. Although
sacrificing a confinement dimension, we find 10$^4$ times SERS enhancement
across a broad spectral range enabled by the waveguide's larger sensing volume
and non-resonant mode. Remarkably, the waveguide-SERS (W-SERS) is bright enough
to image Raman transport across the waveguides exposing the roles of
nanofocusing and the Purcell effect. Emulating the $\beta$-factor from laser
physics, the near unity Raman $\beta$-factor observed exposes the SERS
technique in a new light and points to alternative routes to controlling Raman
scattering. The ability of W-SERS to direct Raman scattering is relevant to
Raman sensors based on integrated photonics with applications in gas and

study localization phenomena in highly disordered metallic \beta-Ta films grown
by rf sputtering deposition. The dc transport study implies non-metallic
behavior (dr/dT<0), with negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR).
We found that as the absolute TCR value increased, specifying an elevated
degree of disorder, the free charge carrier Drude response decreases,
indicating the enhanced charge carrier localization. Moreover, we found that
the pronounced changes occur at the extended spectral range, involving not only
the Drude resonance, but also the higher-energy Lorentz bands, in evidence of
the attendant electronic correlations. We propose that the charge carrier
localization, or delocalization, is accompanied by the pronounced electronic
band structure reconstruction due to many-body effects, which may be the key
feature for understanding the physics of highly disordered metals.

  Improved proofs and added several remarks",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kuramoto Networks contain non-hyperbolic equilibria whose stability is
sometimes difficult to determine. We consider the extreme case in which all
Jacobian eigenvalues are zero. In this case linearizing the system at the
equilibrium leads to a Jacobian matrix which is zero in every entry. We call
these equilibria completely degenerate. We prove that they exist for certain
intrinsic frequencies if and only if the underlying graph is bipartite, and
that they do not exist for generic intrinsic frequencies. In the case of zero
intrinsic frequencies, we prove that they exist if and only if the graph has an
Euler circuit such that the number of steps between any two visits at the same
vertex is a multiple of 4. The simplest example is the cycle graph with 4
vertices. We prove that graphs with this property exist for every number of
vertices N larger than 5 and that they become asymptotically rare for N large.
Regarding stability, we prove that for any choice of intrinsic frequencies, any
coupling strength and any graph with at least one edge, completely degenerate
equilibria are not Lyapunov stable. As a corollary, we obtain that stable
equilibria in Kuramoto Networks must have at least one strictly negative
eigenvalue.

However, patient privacy has become a major concern that limits data sharing

data, which benefits from the development and proliferation of generative
models, has served as a promising substitute for real patient EHR data.
However, the current generative models are limited as they only generate single
type of clinical data for a synthetic patient, i.e., either continuous-valued
or discrete-valued. To mimic the nature of clinical decision-making which
encompasses various data types/sources, in this study, we propose a generative
adversarial network (GAN) entitled EHR-M-GAN which simultaneously synthesizes
mixed-type timeseries EHR data. EHR-M-GAN is capable of capturing the
multidimensional, heterogeneous, and correlated temporal dynamics in patient
trajectories. We have validated EHR-M-GAN on three publicly-available intensive
care unit databases with records from a total of 141,488 unique patients, and
performed privacy risk evaluation of the proposed model. EHR-M-GAN has
demonstrated its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks for synthesizing
clinical timeseries with high fidelity, while addressing the limitations
regarding data types and dimensionality in the current generative models.
Notably, prediction models for outcomes of intensive care performed
significantly better when training data was augmented with the addition of
EHR-M-GAN-generated timeseries. EHR-M-GAN may have use in developing AI
algorithms in resource-limited settings, lowering the barrier for data
acquisition while preserving patient privacy.

boson are of increasing interest at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as direct
precision probes of one of the least-tested sectors of the Standard Model (SM),
the quartic couplings of the EW gauge bosons. These processes therefore offer
promising opportunities for searches for indirect signals of Beyond-the-SM
(BSM) physics. In this paper, we present results for fiducial cross sections at
next-to-leading-order (NLO) EW and NLO QCD to $p\;p\to
e^{+}\;\nu_{e}\;\mu^{+}\;\mu^{-}\;\gamma$ at the 13 TeV LHC. This signature
includes the triboson production process $p\;p \to W^{+}\;Z\;\gamma$ with
leptonic decays, $W^{+} \to e^{+}\;\nu_{e}$ and $Z \to \mu^{+}\;\mu^{-}$. The
computation is based on the complete set of leading-order (LO) contributions of
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha^5)$ and on NLO EW and NLO QCD cross sections of
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^5 \alpha_\text{s})$,
respectively, and thus off-shell effects, spin correlations and non-resonance
contributions are fully taken into account. We construct a Monte Carlo
framework which provides total and differential cross sections for a chosen set
of basic analysis cuts. We find that while NLO EW corrections enhance the
fiducial LO total cross section by only $1\%$, they can significantly change
some distributions in certain kinematic regions. For example, the relative NLO
EW corrections to the muon transverse momentum distribution at 500 GeV amounts
to $-20\%$. To illustrate how missing NLO EW corrections could masquerade as
BSM physics, we show examples for the impact of dimension-8 operators in the SM

viewpoints, reconstructing complete 3D shapes based on incomplete observations
becomes a fundamental problem for computer vision. With a single incomplete
point cloud, it becomes the partial point cloud completion problem. Given
multiple different observations, 3D reconstruction can be addressed by
performing partial-to-partial point cloud registration. Recently, a large-scale
Multi-View Partial (MVP) point cloud dataset has been released, which consists
of over 100,000 high-quality virtual-scanned partial point clouds. Based on the
MVP dataset, this paper reports methods and results in the Multi-View Partial

and aurora on the Earth and the oxygen abundance in stellar atmospheres, but
has not been detected in an exoplanet atmosphere before. We present a definite
ground-based detection of the neutral oxygen 777.4 nm triplet lines in the
transmission spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9b, the hottest known giant
planet. The synthetic spectrum computed employing novel non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer calculations matches the data
significantly better compared to the one computed assuming local thermodynamic
equilibrium. These NLTE radiative transfer calculations imply a mass-loss rate
of 10^8-10^9 kg s-1, which exceeds the lower limit of 10^7-10^8 kg s-1 required
to facilitate the escape of oxygen and iron from the atmosphere. Assuming a
solar oxygen abundance, the NLTE model points towards the need of
microturbulence and macroturbulence broadening of 3.0pm0.7 km s-1 and 13pm5 km
s-1, respectively, indicative of the presence of fast winds in the middle and
upper atmosphere. Present and upcoming high-resolution spectrographs will allow
the detection in other exoplanets of the 777.4 nm OI triplet, which is a
powerful tool to constrain the key characteristics of exoplanetary atmospheres

i) a model pretrained by a curriculum of pretext tasks outperforms models
pretrained by individual pretext tasks, and ii) a model pretrained by the

demonstrate that this performance gain is related to the fact that the
curriculum of pretext tasks better focuses the attention of the final model on
the skin lesion. Beyond performance improvement, this strategy allows for a
large reduction in the training time with respect to ImageNet pretraining,
which is especially advantageous for network architectures tailored for a

field has a rich equilibrium phase diagram which includes Haldane, Luttinger
liquid, singlet, and paramagnetic phases. We show that the nearest neighbor
bipartite and multipartite entanglement can detect quantum critical lines and
phases in this model. We determine a region in parameter space in which the
dynamical states, starting from the ground state of the Haldane (dimer) phase
can create highly multipartite entangled states for any time period, thereby
establishing it as a potential candidate for the implementation of quantum
information tasks. We also exhibit that if the initial and evolved states are
in two different phases, the nonanalytic behavior of multipartite entanglement
and the rate function based on Loschmidt echo can signal quantum phase
transition happened at zero temperature. In a similar spirit, we report that
from the product state, the patterns of block entanglement entropy of the
evolved state with time can also infer the phase transition at equilibrium.

many reasons, often subject to delays of weeks. In contrast, data on

shortcoming of previous online data disease surveillance models by explicitly
accounting for the incremental delivery of case count data, to ensure that our
approach can be used in practice. We also draw on data from Google Trends and
Twitter in tandem, and demonstrate that this leads to slightly better estimates
than a model using only one of these data streams alone. Our results provide
evidence that online data can be used to improve both the accuracy and
precision of rapid estimates of disease incidence, even where the underlying

large-$M$ limit, we obtain the saddle-point equations satisfied by the
collective fields, which determine the typical timescales of the dissipative

system to its steady state. We solve the saddle-point equations numerically and
find that, for strong or intermediate dissipation, the system relaxes
exponentially, with a spectral gap that can be computed analytically, while for
weak dissipation, there are oscillatory corrections to the exponential
relaxation. In this letter, we illustrate the feasibility of analytical

paper examines the origins of these events in the XENON1T experiment.
Characterization of the intensity of delayed electron backgrounds shows that
the resulting emissions are correlated, in time and position, with high-energy
events and can effectively be vetoed. In this work we extend previous S2-only
analyses down to a single electron. From this analysis, after removing the
correlated backgrounds, we observe rates < 30 events/(electron*kg*day) in the
region of interest spanning 1 to 5 electrons. We derive 90% confidence upper

transmission electron microscopy measurements show the formation of a Mn-rich

epitaxial growth of Cd3As2, resulting in phase separation. Magnetometry
measurements of such samples indicate a ferromagnetic phase with out-of-plane
magnetic anisotropy. Electrical magneto-transport measurements of these films
as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and chemical potential reveal a
lower carrier density and higher electron mobility compared to pristine Cd3As2
films grown under similar conditions. This suggests that the surfactant effect
might also serve to getter impurities. We observe robust quantum transport

given the scope of experimental programs aimed at its identification. While
terrestrial experiments may be able to nail down a model, an alternative, and
equally promising, method is to identify dark matter based on astrophysical or
cosmological signatures. A particularly sensitive approach is based on the
unique signature of dark matter substructure on galaxy-galaxy strong lensing
images. Machine learning applications have been explored in detail for
extracting just this signal. With limited availability of high quality strong
lensing data, these approaches have exclusively relied on simulations.
Naturally, due to the differences with the real instrumental data, machine
learning models trained on simulations are expected to lose accuracy when
applied to real data. This is where domain adaptation can serve as a crucial
bridge between simulations and real data applications. In this work, we
demonstrate the power of domain adaptation techniques applied to strong
gravitational lensing data with dark matter substructure. We show with
simulated data sets of varying complexity, that domain adaptation can
significantly mitigate the losses in the model performance. This technique can
help domain experts build and apply better machine learning models for
extracting useful information from strong gravitational lensing data expected

well-studied hot Jupiters with a hierarchy of atmospheric temperatures:
HD189733b ($T_{\rm eq} \simeq 1200$K), HD209458b ($T_{\rm eq} \simeq 1450$K)

They are dominated by i) the poorly understood magnitude of turbulent transport

that the cooler HD189733b is not subject to enhanced mixing from
semi-transparent shear turbulence while the daysides of the hotter Kepler7b and

probe of late-time dynamics of black holes, particularly in the context of

quantifying the spread of an operator in Krylov space as a consequence of time
evolution. Complexity is expected to behave differently in chaotic many-body
systems, as compared to integrable ones. In this paper we investigate Krylov
complexity for the case of interacting integrable models at finite size and
find that complexity saturation is suppressed as compared to chaotic systems.
We associate this behavior with a novel localization phenomenon on the Krylov
chain by mapping the theory of complexity growth and spread to an Anderson
localization hopping model with off-diagonal disorder, and find that
localization is enhanced in the integrable case due to a stronger disorder in
the hopping amplitudes, inducing an effective suppression of Krylov complexity.
We demonstrate this behavior for an interacting integrable model, the XXZ spin

Regret bounds are the tightest possible due to the introduction of
$\phi$-convex. As instantiations, regret bounds of normalized exponentiated
subgradient and greedy/lazy projection are better than the currently known
optimal results. By replacing losses of online game with monotone operators,
and extending the definition of regret, namely regret$^n$, we extend online
convex optimization to online monotone optimization.

work, we deconstruct the current constraints from the Planck CMB and the
full-shape clustering data of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey

use two different analyses, a grid sampling and a profile likelihood, to
investigate whether the current constraints suffer from volume effects upon

$f_\mathrm{EDE}$. We find that $f_\mathrm{EDE}$ allowed by the data strongly
depends on the particular choice of the other parameters of the model and that
several choices of these parameters prefer larger values of $f_\mathrm{EDE}$
than in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. This suggests that volume
effects are the reason behind the disagreement in the literature. Motivated by
this, we use a profile likelihood to analyze the EDE model and compute a
confidence interval for $f_\mathrm{EDE}$, finding $f_\mathrm{EDE} = 0.072\pm
0.036$ ($68\%$ C.L.). This confidence interval is not subject to volume

absence of dense depth maps, failure modes for LiDAR, relative location between

propose a multi-modal approach which uses 2D labels on RGB images as weak

incorporates LiDAR and camera inputs with an auxiliary segmentation branch. On

careful ablation studies and parts based analysis illustrate the advantages of

identify gauge transformations with unobservable phase factors in the classical

underlying a hybrid wave equation previously proposed by the authors. While the
original construction ensures a positive-definite quantum density matrix, the
present model also guarantees the same property for the classical Liouville
density. After a suitable wavefunction factorization, gauge invariance is
achieved by resorting to the classical Lagrangian paths made available by the
Madelung transform of Koopman wavefunctions. Due to the appearance of a
phase-space analogue of the Berry connection, the new hybrid wave equation is
highly nonlinear and it is proposed here as a platform for further developments
in quantum-classical dynamics. Indeed, the associated model is Hamiltonian and
appears to be the first to ensure a series of consistency properties beyond
positivity of quantum and classical densities. For example, the model possesses
a quantum-classical Poincar\'e integral invariant and its special cases include
both the mean-field model and the Ehrenfest model from chemical physics.

selected about 500.000 high-proper-motion stars from Gaia eDR3 with
$\mu_{tot}>100\,\mathrm{mas/yr}$ and searched for background sources close to
their paths. We applied various selection criteria and cuts in order to exclude
spurious sources and co-moving stars. By forecasting the future positions of
lens and source we determined epoch of and angular separation at closest
approach, and determined an expected positional shift and magnification. Using
Gaia~eDR3, we predict 1758 new microlensing events with expected shifts larger
than 0.1 mas between the epochs J2010.5 and mid J2066.0. Further we provide
more precise information on the angular separation at closest approach for 3084
previously predicted events. This helps to select better targets for
observations, especially for events which occur within the next decade. Our
search lead to the new prediction of an interesting astrometric-microlensing
event by the white dwarf Gaia eDR3-4053455379420641152. In 2025 it will pass by
a $G=20.25\,\mathrm{mag}$ star, which will lead to a positional shift of the
major image of $\delta\theta_{+}=1.2^{+2.0}_{-0.5}\,\mathrm{mas}$.
  Since the background source is only $\Delta G=2.45\,\mathrm{mag}$ fainter
than the lens, also the shift of the combined center of light will be
measurable, especially using a near infrared filter, where the background star
is brighter than the lens $\Delta Ks=-1.1\,\mathrm{mag}$

computation. While quantum error-corrected memories have been extensively
studied in the literature, explicit constructions and detailed analyses of
thresholds and resource overheads of universal logical gate sets have so far
been limited. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for universal
fault-tolerant logic motivated by the combined need for platform-independent
logical gate definitions, flexible and scalable tools for numerical analysis,
and exploration of novel schemes for universal logic that improve resource
overheads. Central to our framework is the description of logical gates
holistically in a way which treats space and time on a similar footing.
Focusing on schemes based on surface codes, we introduce explicit, but
platform-independent representations of topological logic gates -- called
logical blocks -- and generate new, overhead-efficient methods for universal
quantum computation. As a specific example, we propose fault-tolerant schemes
based on surface codes concatenated with more general low-density parity check
(LDPC) codes. The logical blocks framework enables a convenient mapping from an
abstract description of the logical gate to a precise set of physical
instructions for both circuit-based and fusion-based quantum computation
(FBQC). Using this, we numerically simulate a surface-code-based universal gate
set implemented with FBQC, and verify that their thresholds are consistent with
the bulk memory threshold. We find that boundaries, defects, and twists can
significantly impact the logical error rate scaling, with periodic boundary
conditions potentially halving the resource requirements. Motivated by the
favorable logical error rates for boundaryless computation, we introduce a
novel computational scheme based on the teleportation of twists that may offer
further resource reductions.

The low energy description corresponds to a quantum dimer model on a dual

appropriately constructed frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point, the
ground state wavefunction can be exactly mapped onto a classical vertex model
on the dual lattice. When the dual lattice is bipartite, the vertex models are
bonded and are self dual under Wegner's duality, with the self dual point
corresponding to the RK point of the original multi-dimer model. We argue that
the self dual point is a critical point based on known exact solutions to some
of the vertex models. When the dual lattice is non-bipartite, the vertex model
is arrowed, and we use numerical methods to argue that there is no phase
transition as a function of the vertex weights. Motivated by these wavefunction
dualities, we construct two other distinct families of frustration-free
Hamiltonians whose ground states can be mapped onto these vertex models. Many
of these RK Hamiltonians provably host $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered

multiple-output (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks is
investigated in this paper. The base station broadcasts multicast data to all
users and also integrates additional services, unicast data targeted to certain
users, and confidential data protected against eavesdroppers. We categorize the
above MIMO-NOMA with different security requirements into several communication
scenarios. The associated problem in each scenario is nonconvex. We propose a
unified approach, called the power splitting scheme, for optimizing the rate
equations corresponding to the scenarios. The proposed method decomposes the
optimization of the secure MIMO-NOMA channel into a set of simpler problems,
including multicast, point-to-point, and wiretap MIMO problems, corresponding
to the three basic messages: multicast, private/unicast, and confidential
messages. We then leverage existing solutions to design signaling for the above
problems such that the messages are transmitted with high security and
reliability. Numerical results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed
covariance matrix design in secure MIMO-NOMA transmission. The proposed method
also outperforms existing solutions, when applicable.
  In the case of no multicast messages, we also reformulate the nonconvex
problem into weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problems by applying the
block successive maximization method and generalizing the zero duality gap. The
two methods have their advantages and limitations. Power splitting is a general
tool that can be applied to the MIMO-NOMA with any combination of the three
messages (multicast, private, and confidential) whereas WSR maximization shows
greater potential for secure MIMO-NOMA communication without multicasting. In
such cases, WSR maximization provides a slightly better rate than the power
splitting method.

${\cal N}=4n$ supersymmetry, as well as all scalar correlators in any non SUSY
theory in any dimension, and conjecturally various 5d, 2d and 1d superconformal
theories. The superblocks are eigenfunctions of the super Casimir of the
superconformal group whose action we find to be precisely that of the
$BC_{m|n}$ Calogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS) Hamiltonian. When $m=0$ the blocks
are polynomials, and we show how these relate to $BC_n$ Jacobi polynomials.
However, differently from $BC_n$ Jacobi polynomials, the $m=0$ blocks possess a
crucial stability property that has not been emphasised previously in the
literature. This property allows for a novel supersymmetric uplift of the
$BC_n$ Jacobi polynomials, which in turn yields the $(m,n;\theta)$ superblocks.
Superblocks defined in this way are related to Heckman-Opdam hypergeometrics
and are non polynomial functions. A fruitful interaction between the
mathematics of symmetric functions and SCFT follows, and we give a number of
new results on both sides. One such example is a new Cauchy identity which
naturally pairs our superconformal blocks with Sergeev-Veselov super Jacobi
polynomials and yields the CPW decomposition of any free theory diagram in any

nonmonotone set-valued transmission conditions is analyzed. The investigated
problem involves a nonlinear monotone partial differential equation in the
interior domain and the Laplacian in the exterior domain. Such a scalar
interface problem models nonmonotone frictional contact of elastic infinite
media. The variational formulation of the interface problem leads to a
hemivariational inequality, which lives on the unbounded domain, and so cannot
be treated numerically in a direct way. By boundary integral methods the
problem is transformed and a novel hemivariational inequality (HVI) is obtained
that lives on the interior domain and on the coupling boundary, only. Thus for
discretization the coupling of finite elements and boundary elements is the
method of choice. In addition smoothing techniques of nondifferentiable
optimization are adapted and the nonsmooth part in the HVI is regularized. Thus
we reduce the original variational problem to a finite dimensional problem that
can be solved by standard optimization tools. We establish not only convergence
results for the total approximation procedure, but also an asymptotic error
estimate for the regularized HVI.

are expected from particles and fields propagating on a quantum spacetime,
effectively. They are formulated in terms of a modified dispersion relation and
a modified momentum conservation equation. In this work we use Finsler geometry
to formulate deformed relativistic kinematics in terms of particle velocities.
The relation between the Finsler geometric velocity dependent formulation and
the original momentum dependent formulation allows us to construct deformed
Lorentz transformations between arbitrary frames. Moreover, we find the
corresponding compatible momentum conservation equation to first order in the
Planck scale deformation of special relativity based on the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e
algebra in the bicrossproduct basis. We find that the deformed Lorentz
transformations, as well as the deformed time dilation factor, contain terms
that scale with the energy of the particle under consideration to the fourth
power. We derive how the distributions of decay products are affected when the
deformed relativity principle is satisfied and find, for the case of a pion
decaying into a neutrino and a muon, that the ratio of expected neutrinos to
muons with a certain energy is just slightly modified when compared to the
predictions based on special relativity. We also discuss the phenomenological
consequences of this framework for cosmic-ray showers in the atmosphere.

on datasets with appearance-wise distinct classes. It has also been shown that
2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) tend to be biased toward texture rather
than shape in still image recognition tasks, in contrast to humans. Taken
together, this raises suspicion that large video models partly learn spurious
spatial texture correlations rather than to track relevant shapes over time to
infer generalizable semantics from their movement. A natural way to avoid
parameter explosion when learning visual patterns over time is to make use of
recurrence. Biological vision consists of abundant recurrent circuitry, and is
superior to computer vision in terms of domain shift generalization. In this
article, we empirically study whether the choice of low-level temporal modeling
has consequences for texture bias and cross-domain robustness. In order to
enable a light-weight and systematic assessment of the ability to capture
temporal structure, not revealed from single frames, we provide the Temporal
Shape (TS) dataset, as well as modified domains of Diving48 allowing for the
investigation of spatial texture bias in video models. The combined results of

in temporal modeling may be advantageous when robustness to domain shift is
important for the task.

population health and designing public health interventions. Worldwide,
two-thirds of deaths do not have a cause assigned. Verbal autopsy (VA) is a
well-established tool to collect information describing deaths outside of
hospitals by conducting surveys to caregivers of a deceased person. It is
routinely implemented in many low- and middle-income countries. Statistical
algorithms to assign cause of death using VAs are typically vulnerable to the
distribution shift between the data used to train the model and the target
population. This presents a major challenge for analyzing VAs as labeled data
are usually unavailable in the target population. This article proposes a
Latent Class model framework for VA data (LCVA) that jointly models VAs
collected over multiple heterogeneous domains, assign cause of death for
out-of-domain observations, and estimate cause-specific mortality fractions for
a new domain. We introduce a parsimonious representation of the joint
distribution of the collected symptoms using nested latent class models and
develop an efficient algorithm for posterior inference. We demonstrate that
LCVA outperforms existing methods in predictive performance and scalability.

inference with a number of appealing properties, including support for model
learning and data subsampling. By contrast MCMC methods like Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo do not share these properties but remain attractive since, contrary to
parametric methods, MCMC is asymptotically unbiased. For these reasons
researchers have sought to combine the strengths of both classes of algorithms,
with recent approaches coming closer to realizing this vision in practice.
However, supporting data subsampling in these hybrid methods can be a
challenge, a shortcoming that we address by introducing a surrogate likelihood
that can be learned jointly with other variational parameters. We argue
theoretically that the resulting algorithm permits the user to make an
intuitive trade-off between inference fidelity and computational cost. In an
extensive empirical comparison we show that our method performs well in
practice and that it is well-suited for black-box inference in probabilistic
programming frameworks.

efficient diagnostic rules friendly in clinical practice are provided. In this
paper, interesting parameters obtained from the ECG signals analysis are
presented and two simple rules for automatic diagnosis of Bundle Branch Blocks
are defined using new markers derived from the so-called FMMecg delineator. The
main advantages of these markers are the good statistical properties and their
clear interpretation in clinically meaningful terms. High sensitivity and
specificity values have been obtained using the proposed rules with data from
more than 35000 patients from well known benchmarking databases. In particular,
to identify Complete Left Bundle Branch Blocks and differentiate this condition
from subjects without heart diseases, sensitivity and specificity values
ranging from 93% to 99% and from 96% to 99%, respectively. The new markers and
the automatic diagnosis are easily available at

it is compelling for three main reasons. On the one hand, the markers have a
concise electrophysiological interpretation. On the other hand, the diagnosis
rules have a very high accuracy. Finally, the markers can be provided by any
device that registers the ECG signal and the automatic diagnosis is made
straightforwardly, in contrast to the black-box and deep learning algorithms.

tubulin lattice sites. We postulate that the microtubule is mostly uniform,
dominated purely by GDP-bound dimers, and is capped by a disordered regime due
to the presence of GTP-bound dimers as well. In the uniform region, we identify
the electron hopping parameter regime in which the microtubule is a topological
insulator. We then show the manner in which these topological features remain
robust when the hopping parameters are disordered. We briefly mention possible
biological implications for these microtubules to possess topologically robust

Though there is still far to go, there is much reason for optimism. This thesis
examines the underlying principles needed to realise the computational aspects

which thermodynamics constrains the operation and design of such systems, and
it ends with the proposal of a model of computation appropriate for exploiting
these constraints.
  These thermodynamic constraints are approached from three different
directions. The first considers the maximum possible aggregate performance of a
system of computers of given volume, $V$, with a given supply of free energy.
From this perspective, reversible computing is imperative in order to
circumvent the Landauer limit. A result of Frank is refined and strengthened,
showing that the adiabatic regime reversible computer performance is the best
possible for any computer - quantum or classical. This therefore shows a
universal scaling law governing the performance of compact computers of $\sim
V^{5/6}$, compared to $\sim V^{2/3}$ for conventional computers. For the case
of molecular computers, it is shown how to attain this bound. The second
direction extends this performance analysis to the case where individual
computational particles or sub-units can interact with one another. The third
extends it to interactions with shared, non-computational parts of the system.
It is found that accommodating these interactions in molecular computers
imposes a performance penalty that undermines the earlier scaling result.

oscillations of bridges, buildings, airfoils) is a central engineering and
design issue. Mathematically, this translates to strong asymptotic
stabilization of a 3D flow by a 2D elastic structure. The stabilization
(convergence to the stationary set) of a aerodynamic wave-plate model is
established here. A 3D potential flow on the half-space has a spatially-bounded
von Karman plate embedded in the boundary. The physical model, then, is a
Neumann wave equation with low regularity of coupling conditions. Motivated on
empirical observations, we examine if intrinsic panel damping can stabilize the
subsonic flow-plate system to a stationary point. Several partial results have
been established through partial regularization of the model. Without doing so,
classical approaches attempting to treat the given wave boundary data have
fallen short, owing to the failure of the Lopatinski condition (in the sense of
Kreiss, Sakamoto) and the associated regularity defect of the hyperbolic
Neumann mapping. Here, we operate on the panel model as in the engineering
literature with no regularization or modifications; we completely resolve the
question of stability by demonstrating that weak plate damping strongly
stabilizes system trajectories. This is accomplished by microlocalizing the
wave data (given by the plate) and observing an ""anisotropic"" a microlocal
compensation by the plate dynamics precisely where the regularity of the 3D
wave is compromsed (in the characteristic sector). Several additional stability
results for both wave and plate subsystems are established to ""push"" strong
stability of the plate onto the flow.

safe controls that can guarantee safety with high probability. The safety

starlight, but dust properties vary with local environment. In order to
characterize dust in a highly irradiated diffuse cloud, we measure the
reddening and optical polarization towards 27 stars surrounding the
mid-latitude $b$=$+$24$^{\circ}$ O9.2IV star $\zeta$ Ophiuchi, using new
optical spectroscopy and polarimetry. We incrementally deredden and depolarize
with distance, allowing us to distinguish dust components along these
sightlines. The data indicate three distinct dust populations: a foreground
component characteristic of average Milky Way dust ($R_{\rm{V}}$$\approx$3.1,
$d$$\lesssim$180 pc), a highly polarizing mid-distance component in the
vicinity of $\zeta$ Oph ($R_{\rm{V}}$$\approx$2.4, 200 pc$<$$d$$<$300 pc), and
a non-polarizing distant component ($R_{\rm{V}}$$\approx$3.6, 600
pc$<$$d$$<$2000 pc). Prominent 8 $\mu$m infrared striations spanning the field
of view likely have high Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon content and are
illuminated by $\zeta$ Oph. Foreground-subtracted polarizations roughly align
with these striations, which, we argue, lie immediately behind $\zeta$ Oph and
constitute the highly-polarizing mid-distance dust. This component polarizes
very efficiently ($P_{\rm{V}}$$>$9.1$E(B-V)$), implying a high degree of grain
alignment and suggesting that the bulk of the polarization occurs in a small
fraction of the volume. The large $R_{\rm{V}}$ in the distant component reveals
that dust above the Galactic Plane ($z$$>$250 pc) may contain a greater
fraction of large grains than the Milky Way average.

Maximum Entropy on Erroneous Predictions (MEEP), a training strategy for

architecture, does not increase model complexity and can be coupled with
multiple segmentation loss functions. We benchmark the proposed strategy in two

The experimental results demonstrate that coupling MEEP with standard

classifier to distinguish two classes (e.g., responder, non-responder) based on

categories) given multi-category point data from two classes. This problem is
important for generating hypotheses in medical pathology towards discovering
new immunotherapies for cancer treatment as well as for other applications in
biomedical research and microbial ecology. This problem is challenging due to
an exponential number of category subsets which may vary in the strength of
spatial interactions. Most prior efforts on using human selected spatial
association measures may not be sufficient for capturing the relevant (e.g.,
surrounded by) spatial interactions which may be of biological significance. In
addition, the related deep neural networks are limited to category pairs and do
not explore larger subsets of point categories. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a Spatial-interaction Aware Multi-Category deep neural Network

characterization and point pair prioritization layers for
spatial-configuration-based classification. Extensive experimental results on

pebble accretion can increase the mass in the solid disc by at least a few

smaller-sized grains at the snow line and that gas-disc-induced orbital
migration effects are in force. Such a large contribution in mass by pebbles
would seem to imply that the isotopic composition of the inner Solar System
should be similar to the pebble source (i.e. outer Solar System). This
implication appears to violate the observed nucleosynthetic isotopic dichotomy
of the sampled Solar System. Thus, pebble accretion played little or no role in

diachronic evolution of FL across 90 languages of the Pama-Nyungan (PN) family
of Australia. We find a high degree of phylogenetic signal in FL. Though
phylogenetic signal has been reported for phonological structures, such as
phonotactics, its detection in measures of phonological function is novel. We
also find a significant, negative correlation between the FL of vowel length
and of the following consonant, that is, a deep-time historical trade-off
dynamic, which we relate to known allophony in modern PN languages and
compensatory sound changes in their past. The finding reveals a historical
dynamic, similar to transphonologization, which we characterize as a flow of
contrastiveness between subsystems of the phonology. Recurring across a

xenon, such as krypton or argon, while the detector was operating. The method
is based on a continuous purification of the gaseous volume of the detector

concentration of $(360 \pm 60)$ ppq was achieved. It is the lowest
concentration measured in the fiducial volume of an operating dark matter

krypton evolution in the liquid and gas volumes of the detector system for
several operation modes over the time span of 550 days, including the
commissioning and science runs of XENON1T. The online distillation was also
successfully applied to remove Ar-37 after its injection for a low energy

that targets internet-of-things (IoT) platform due to resource constraints. In
comparison, it offers smaller cryptographic primitives such as shorter key

algorithm developments in this emerging subject. Thus, verification is carried
out based upon theoretical (mathematical) proofs mostly. Among the few
available side-channel analysis studies found in literature, the highest
percentage is taken by power attacks. PRESENT is a promising lightweight block
cipher to be included in IoT devices in the near future. Thus, the emphasis of
this paper is on lightweight cryptology, and our investigation shows
unavailability of a correlation electromagnetic analysis (CEMA) of it. Hence,
in an effort to fill in this research gap, we opted to investigate the
capabilities of CEMA against the PRESENT algorithm. This work aims to determine
the probability of secret key leakage with a minimum number of electromagnetic
(EM) waveforms possible. The process initially started from a simple EM
analysis (SEMA) and gradually enhanced up to a CEMA. This paper presents our
methodology in attack modelling, current results that indicate a probability of
leaking seven bytes of the key and upcoming plans for optimisation. In
addition, introductions to lightweight cryptanalysis and theories of EMA are

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of active galactic nuclei (AGN)
is one of the key questions to understand the nature of AGN jets. However,
little is known about the detailed jet structure for AGN like quasars since
very high angular resolutions are required to resolve these objects. We present
very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the archetypical
quasar 3C 273 at 86 GHz, performed with the Global Millimeter VLBI Array, for
the first time including the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Our
observations achieve a high angular resolution down to $\sim$60 ${\rm \mu}$as,
resolving the innermost part of the jet ever on scales of $\sim 10^5$
Schwarzschild radii. Our observations, including close-in-time High Sensitivity
Array observations of 3C 273 at 15, 22, and 43 GHz, suggest that the inner jet
collimates parabolically, while the outer jet expands conically, similar to
jets from other nearby low luminosity AGN. We discovered the jet collimation
break around $10^{7}$ Schwarzschild radii, providing the first compelling
evidence for structural transition in a quasar jet. The location of the
collimation break for 3C 273 is farther downstream the sphere of gravitational
influence (SGI) from the central SMBH. With the results for other AGN jets, our
results show that the end of the collimation zone in AGN jets is governed not
only by the SGI of the SMBH but also by the more diverse properties of the
central nuclei.

mass is not completely determined. At large scales, it is governed by galactic
encounters, mass inflows connected to spirals arms and bars, or due to
expanding shells from supernova (SN) explosions in the central parts of
galaxies. The investigation of the latter process requires an extensive set of
gas dynamical simulations to explore the muti-dimensional parameter space
needed to frame the phenomenon. The aims of this paper are to extend our
investigation of the importance of supernovae for inducing accretion onto a
SMBH and carry out a comparison between the fully hydrodynamic code Flash and
the much less computationally intensive code Ring, which uses the thin shell
approximation. We simulate 3D expanding shells in a gravitational potential
similar to that of the Galactic Center with a variety of homogeneous and
turbulent environments. In homogeneous media, we find convincing agreement
between Flash and Ring in the shapes of shells and their equivalent radii
throughout their whole evolution until they become subsonic. In highly
inhomogeneous, turbulent media, there is also a good agreement of shapes and
sizes of shells, and of the times of their first contact with the central 1 pc
sphere, where we assume that they join the accretion flow. The comparison
supports the proposition that a SN occurring at a galactocentric distance of 5
pc typically drives 1 - 3 $M_\odot$ into the central 1 pc around the galactic

ranging from acoustic noise supression to echo cancelation, array beamforming,
channel equalization, to more recent sensor network applications in
surveillance, target localization, and tracking. A trending approach in this
direction is to recur to in-network distributed processing in which individual
nodes implement adaptation rules and diffuse their estimation to the network.
  When the a priori knowledge about the filtering scenario is limited or
imprecise, selecting the most adequate filter structure and adjusting its
parameters becomes a challenging task, and erroneous choices can lead to
inadequate performance. To address this difficulty, one useful approach is to
rely on combinations of adaptive structures.
  The combination of adaptive filters exploits to some extent the same divide
and conquer principle that has also been successfully exploited by the
machine-learning community (e.g., in bagging or boosting). In particular, the
problem of combining the outputs of several learning algorithms (mixture of
experts) has been studied in the computational learning field under a different
perspective: rather than studying the expected performance of the mixture,
deterministic bounds are derived that apply to individual sequences and,
therefore, reflect worst-case scenarios. These bounds require assumptions
different from the ones typically used in adaptive filtering, which is the
emphasis of this overview article. We review the key ideas and principles
behind these combination schemes, with emphasis on design rules. We also
illustrate their performance with a variety of examples.

specialised tools. The paper's main contribution includes details on how
hardware abstraction and verification results can be transferred between tools
in order to verify system-level safety properties. It is noteworthy that the
HVC application considered in this paper has a rather generic form of a
feedback controller. Hence, the co-verification framework and experiences
reported here are also highly relevant for any cyber-physical system tracking a

feature extraction which exploit correlations among input variables
representing the data. One important property that is enjoyed by most such
methods is uncorrelation among the extracted features. Recently, regularized
versions of MVA methods have appeared in the literature, mainly with the goal
to gain interpretability of the solution. In these cases, the solutions can no
longer be obtained in a closed manner, and more complex optimization methods
that rely on the iteration of two steps are frequently used. This paper recurs
to an alternative approach to solve efficiently this iterative problem. The
main novelty of this approach lies in preserving several properties of the
original methods, most notably the uncorrelation of the extracted features.
Under this framework, we propose a novel method that takes advantage of the
l-21 norm to perform variable selection during the feature extraction process.
Experimental results over different problems corroborate the advantages of the
proposed formulation in comparison to state of the art formulations.

applications if they can improve existing parameters such as neutrino detector
size, portability, their sensitivity to a large range of reactor antineutrino
energies, and resources required for operation. Thus, modelling the
antineutrino spectrum is a crucial step to study the reactor antineutrino
spectra and the CEvNS detector response. The first objective of this paper is
to study the importance of fission product libraries in the construction of
antineutrino spectrum using the summation method and with various corrections.
We have used ENDF/B-VIII and JEFF3.3 as our base data to model the spectrum. We
have also included the TAGS data (pandemonium free) when such data is
available. The isomeric transitions correction has the highest impact on the
antineutrino spectra increasing the values 29% to 37% on an average in the
energy range of 0.5 MeV to 2 MeV. This correction also shows an increase of
4.71% to 7.13% in the range of 0 to 2 MeV, with improving isomeric transitions
using the TAGS data. Next, the spectra including the isomeric transition
correction using the Gross Theory causes reduction by 11.56 % to 69.46 % in the
range of 6 to 8 MeV. The finite size, radiative, and weak magnetism corrections
cause no more than 3.27% difference between the corrected and uncorrected
spectra. Our second objective is to calculate pulse height distributions of Ge
and Si based CEvNS sensors assuming a 20eV nuclear recoil threshold. In our
study, we have assumed a 100kg detector placed 10m away from the 1MW TRIGA
reactor. Our results show that the detector response with corrected spectra for
a natural Ge and Si detector are 44.25events/day and 7.99events/day. The
biggest impact on the detector response is due to the isomeric transition
correction; with 37% difference between the corrected and uncorrected detector
response is observed.

following: is machine learning a viable option for improving traditional
combinatorial optimization solvers on specific problem distributions, when
historical data is available? This was motivated by the fact that in many
practical scenarios, the data changes only slightly between the repetitions of
a combinatorial optimization problem, and this is an area where machine

for the instrumentation of large detector volumes with single-photon
sensitivity. The key objective is to improve the signal-to-noise ratio which is
achieved by decoupling the photosensitive area of a sensor from the cathode
area of its photomultiplier tube (PMT).
  The WOM consists of a transparent tube with two PMTs attached to its ends.
The tube is coated with wavelength-shifting paint absorbing ultra-violet
photons with nearly $100\,\%$ efficiency. Depending on the environment, e.g.
air (ice), up to $73\,\%$ $(41\,\%)$ of the subsequently emitted optical
photons can be captured by total internal reflection and propagate towards the
PMTs where they are recorded.
  The optical properties of the paint, the geometry of the tube and the
coupling of the tube to the PMTs have been optimized for maximal sensitivity
based on theoretical derivations and experimental evaluations. Prototypes were
built to demonstrate the technique and to develop a reproducible construction
process.
  Important measurable characteristics of the WOM are the wavelength dependent
effective area, the transit time spread of detected photons and the
signal-to-noise ratio. The WOM outperforms bare PMTs especially with respect to
the low signal-to-noise ratio with an increase of a factor up to 8.9 in air
(5.2 in ice). Since the gain in sensitivity is mostly in the UV-regime, the WOM
is an ideal sensor for Cherenkov and scintillation detectors.

almost all flows encountered in everyday life: river, rain, flow in a pipe,
blood flow, airflow over an airplane, etc. We show that the norm of the
pressure gradient over the field is minimum at every instant of time! We call
it the principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG). The principle is deeply
rooted in classical mechanics via Gauss' principle of least constraint.
Therefore, while we prove mathematically that Navier-Stokes' equation
represents the necessary condition for minimization of the pressure gradient,
the PMPG stands on its own philosophy independent of Navier-Stokes'. It turns
any fluid mechanics problem into a minimization one. We demonstrate this
intriguing property by solving three of the classical problems in fluid
mechanics using the PMPG without resorting to Navier-Stokes' equation. In fact,
the inviscid version of the PMPG allowed solving the long-standing problem of
the aerohydrodynamic lift over smooth cylindrical shapes where Euler's equation
fails to provide a unique answer. Moreover, the result challenges the accepted
wisdom about lift generation on an airfoil, which has prevailed over a century.
The PMPG is expected to be transformative for theoretical modeling of fluid
mechanics as it encodes a complicated nonlinear partial differential equation
into a simple minimization problem. The principle even transcends
Navier-Stokes' equations in its applicability to non-Newtonian fluids with
arbitrary constitutive relations and fluids subject to arbitrary forcing (e.g.
electric or magnetic).

scattering by the targets taken over a collection of individual spatial
locations along the flight path making up the synthetic aperture. Because
signal subspace imaging methods do not work on these measurements directly, we
rearrange the frequency response at each spatial location using the Prony
method and obtain a matrix that is suitable for these methods. We arrange the
set of these Prony matrices as one block-diagonal matrix and introduce a signal
subspace imaging method for it. We show that this signal subspace method yields
high-resolution and quantitative images provided that the signal-to-noise ratio
is sufficiently high. We give a resolution analysis for this imaging method and
validate this theory using numerical simulations. Additionally, we show that
this imaging method is stable to random perturbations to the travel times and
validate this theory with numerical simulations using the random travel time
model for random media.

one assumes an underlying algorithmic-informational bias toward simplicity in
finite dataset generators, we show that current approaches to machine learning
(including deep learning, or any formal-theoretic hybrid mix of top-down AI and

that, for every learning algorithm (with or without access to a formal theory),
there is a sufficiently large dataset size above which the algorithmic

algorithmic probability of any other larger dataset. In other words, very large

globally optimal solution while converging toward the
low-algorithmic-complexity locally optimal solution, although the latter is
deemed a global one by the learning algorithm. We discuss the framework and
additional empirical conditions to be met in order to circumvent this deceptive

challenging task. Baseline solutions that repeatedly invoke a protocol designed

problem of frequency estimation protocol for longitudinal binary data, with
$\ell_\infty$ error of $O ( (1 / \epsilon) \cdot (\log d)^{3 / 2} \cdot k \cdot
\sqrt{ n \cdot \log ( d / \beta ) } )$, where $\epsilon$ is the privacy budget,
$d$ is the number of time periods, $k$ is the maximum number of changes of user

polylogarithmically with $d$, but linearly with $k$.
  In this paper, we break through the linear dependence on $k$ in the

sequential data, FutureRand, with two key features. The first is a composition
strategy that correlates the noise across the non-zero elements of the
sequence. The second is a pre-computation technique which, by exploiting the
symmetry of input space, enables the randomizer to output the results on the

reinforcement learning, particularly in the experience replay setting now
commonly used with deep neural networks. Classically, off-policy estimation
bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are
re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio (via
eligibility traces) after each action. Many important off-policy algorithms
such as Tree Backup and Retrace rely on this mechanism along with differing
protocols for truncating (""cutting"") the ratios (""traces"") to counteract the
excessive variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, cutting traces on a
per-decision basis is not necessarily efficient; once a trace has been cut
according to local information, the effect cannot be reversed later,
potentially resulting in the premature truncation of estimated returns and
slower learning. In the interest of motivating efficient off-policy algorithms,
we propose a multistep operator that permits arbitrary past-dependent traces.
We prove that our operator is convergent for policy evaluation, and for optimal
control when targeting greedy-in-the-limit policies. Our theorems establish the
first convergence guarantees for many existing algorithms including Truncated
IS, Non-Markov Retrace, and history-dependent TD($\lambda$). Our theoretical

cells (crawling and swimming) and artificial swimmers. An outstanding feature
is the ability of these entities to follow complex trajectories, ranging from
straight, curved (circular, helical...), to random-like ones. The non-straight
nature of these trajectories is often explained as a consequence of the
asymmetry of the particle or the medium in which it moves, or due to the
presence of bounding walls, etc... Here, we show that straight, circular and
helical trajectories emerge naturally in the absence of asymmetry of the
swimmer or that of suspending medium. Our first proof is based on general
considerations, without referring to an explicit form of a model. We show that
these three trajectories correspond to self-congruent solutions.
Self-congruency means that the states of the system at different moments of
time can be made identical by an appropriate combination of rotation and
translation of the coordinate space. We show that these solutions are exhibited
by spherically symmetric particles as a result of a series of pitchfork
bifurcations as the activity is increased. Self-congruent dynamics in one and
two dimensions are analyzed as well. Finally, we present a simple explicit
nonlinear exactly solvable model of fully isotropic phoretic particle that
shows the transitions from a non-motile state to straight motion to circular
motion to helical motion as a series of spontaneous symmetry-breaking
bifurcations. Whether a system exhibits or not a given trajectory only depends
on the numerical values of parameters entering the model, while asymmetry of
swimmer shape, or anisotropy of the suspending medium , or influence of

successes in reinforcement learning methods to approximately solve optimal
control problems with performance objectives make their application to
certification problems attractive; however, the Lagrange-type objective used in
reinforcement learning is not suitable to encode temporal logic requirements.
Recent work has shown promise in extending the reinforcement learning machinery
to safety-type problems, whose objective is not a sum, but a minimum (or
maximum) over time. In this work, we generalize the reinforcement learning
formulation to handle all optimal control problems in the reach-avoid category.
We derive a time-discounted reach-avoid Bellman backup with contraction mapping
properties and prove that the resulting reach-avoid Q-learning algorithm
converges under analogous conditions to the traditional Lagrange-type problem,
yielding an arbitrarily tight conservative approximation to the reach-avoid
set. We further demonstrate the use of this formulation with deep reinforcement
learning methods, retaining zero-violation guarantees by treating the
approximate solutions as untrusted oracles in a model-predictive supervisory
control framework. We evaluate our proposed framework on a range of nonlinear

orders. The photoexcitation induced modulation on charge population of the
Ti-Se bonds generates a laser-fluence-dependent interatomic-repulsive force
along each Ti-Se bond. The nonequal length of these six Ti-Se bonds gives rise
to a net force exerted on the central distorted Ti atom to push it toward the
suppressing of the PLD and thus the CDW orders. We further illustrate that the
dynamics of each distorted Ti atom behaves as though it attached to a spring in
a simple harmonic motion with a fluence-dependent oscillation frequency,
uniting two previously reported scaling laws for phase transition time. These
findings significantly advance the understanding of CDW instability and provide
new insights into how photoexcitation induced modulation on charge population
may lead to phase transitions by directly connecting interatomic forces with
reaction pathways.

This is an important assumption that allows the existing beam management

UL beams are inferred from the measurements of the DL reference signals. Beam
correspondence holds when the radio configurations are symmetric in the DL and
UL. However, as mmWave technology matures, the DL and the UL face different

Meanwhile, if the UL beam with sub-array, named as sub-chain beam in this

distribution in their work motivates us to revisit the definition of FRBs. In
this work, we ascribe the bimodal distribution to two physical kinds of radio
bursts, which may have different radiation mechanisms. We propose to use
brightness temperature to separate two subtypes. For FRB 20121102A, the
critical brightness temperature is $T_{\rm B,cri}\simeq10^{33}\,\rm K$. Bursts
with $T_{\rm B}\geq T_{\rm B,cri}$ are denoted as ""classical"" FRBs, and further
we find a tight pulse width-fluence relation
($T\propto\mathcal{F_\nu}^{0.306}$) for them. On the contrary, the other bursts
are considered as ""atypical"" bursts that may originate from a different
physical process. We suggest that for each FRB event, a similar dividing line
should exist but $T_{\rm B,cri}$ is not necessarily the same. Its exact value
depends on FRB radiation mechanism and properties of the source.

results of the experiment by analysing, along with traditional indicators such

microscopic observables are influenced by density. Furthermore, we report a
preliminary but quantitative analysis on the emergence of self-organising
stripes in the crossing area.
  We also try to reproduce the empirical results using a hierarchy of models,
which differ in the details of the body shape (using a disk-shaped body vs a
more realistic elliptical shape) and in how collision avoiding is performed
(using only information regarding ""centre of mass"" distance and velocity, or
actually introducing body shape information). We verified that the most
detailed model (i.e., using body shape information and an elliptical body)
outperforms in a significant way the simplest one (using only centre of mass

if elliptical bodies are introduced without using such information in collision
avoidance, the performance of the model is relatively poor. Nevertheless, the
difference between the different models is relevant only in describing the

models could be of practical use only for describing high density settings. We
also verified that ""stripe formation"" emerges in all models.

vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of adversarial examples. In this
paper, we focus on malware with the file format of portable executable (PE) in
the family of Windows operating systems, namely Windows PE malware, as a
representative case to study the adversarial attack methods in such adversarial
settings. To be specific, we start by first outlining the general learning
framework of Windows PE malware detection based on ML/DL and subsequently
highlighting three unique challenges of performing adversarial attacks in the
context of Windows PE malware. Then, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic
review to categorize the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against PE
malware detection, as well as corresponding defenses to increase the robustness
of Windows PE malware detection. Finally, we conclude the paper by first
presenting other related attacks against Windows PE malware detection beyond
the adversarial attacks and then shedding light on future research directions
and opportunities. In addition, a curated resource list of adversarial attacks
and defenses for Windows PE malware detection is also available at

However, training a virtual assistant in other languages than English is often

investigate is the number of turns (H) to feed as history to model. We first
explore the turning point where increasing H begins to yield limiting returns
on the overall performance. Then we examine whether the examples a model with
small H gets wrong can be categorized in a way for the model to do few-shot
finetuning on. Lastly, will explore the limitations of this approach, and
whether there is a certain type of examples that this approach will not be able

approximation error, (2) statistical complexity, and (3) coverage. The first
two sources are common in model selection for supervised learning, where
optimally trading-off these properties is well-studied. In contrast, the third

finite-size particles with various aspect ratios in a Taylor-Couette (TC)
turbulent flow. The current Reynolds number, $Re$, ranges from $6.5\times10^3$
to $2.6\times10^4$, and the particle volume fraction, $\Phi$, is up to $10\%$.
Particles with three kinds of aspect ratio, $\lambda$, are used: $\lambda=1/3$
(oblate), $\lambda=1$ (spherical) and $\lambda=3$ (prolate). Unlike the case of
bubbly TC flow, we find that the suspended finite-size particles increase the
drag of the TC system regardless of their aspect ratios. In addition, the
normalized friction coefficient, $c_{f,\Phi}/c_{f,\Phi=0}$, decreases with
increasing $Re$, the reason could be that in the current low volume fractions
the turbulent stress becomes dominant at higher $Re$. As $Re$ increases, the
particles distribute more evenly in the entire system, which results from both
the greater turbulence intensity and the more pronounced finite-size effects of
the particles at higher $Re$. Moreover, it is found that the variation of the
particle aspect ratios leads to different particle collective effects. The
suspended spherical particles, which tend to cluster near the walls and form a
particle layer, significantly affect the boundary layer and result in maximum
drag modification. The minimal drag modification is found in the oblate case,
where the particles preferentially cluster in the bulk region, and thus the
particle layer is absent. Based on the optical measurement results, it can be
concluded that, in the low volume fraction ranges ($\Phi=0.5\%$ and $\Phi =
2\%$ here), the larger drag modification is connected to the near-wall particle
clustering. The present findings suggest that the particle shape plays a
significant role in drag modification.

the energy consumption, we exploit a pair of sleep-scheduling policies, namely
the multiple vacation (MV) policy and start-up threshold (ST) policy, which are
characterized in the context of three typical multiple access protocols,
including time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple

closed-form expressions for the MTCD system's peak AoI, which are formulated as
the optimization objective under the constraints of EH power, status update

proposed for finding the optimal solution by fixing the status update rate. As
a design alternative, a low complexity concave-convex procedure (CCP) is also

scheme has shown its ability to resist overfitting. However, in the training
stage, current meta-learning-based methods utilize only one task along a single

identified-hadron (PID) $p_t$ spectra from 5 TeV $p$-Pb collisions. In Part I a
revised two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of PID spectra was introduced,
an apparent detection inefficiency for protons was corrected and jet-related
spectrum hard components isolated via an improved method were compared to a
fixed TCM serving as reference. In the present article (Part II) the TCM is
further elaborated to describe centrality variation of spectrum hard components
(and therefore entire spectra) within data statistical uncertainties as
determined by a standard statistical measure (Z-scores). The completed PID TCM
is then used to investigate properties of spectrum and yield ratios (e.g.
$p/\pi$ ratios) and ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$ data. Systematic differences are
observed between meson and baryon hard components. With increasing $p$-Pb
centrality meson hard components shift to lower $p_t$ while baryon hard
components shift to higher $p_t$. Those trends explain quantitatively the main
features and centrality variation of spectrum ratios. Ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$
trends are also predicted at the level of data statistical uncertainties, and
details of the $\bar p_t$ centrality trends are explained quantitatively.

functionality. However, a test case can be flaky, i.e., passing and failing
across executions, even for the same version of the source code. Flaky test
cases introduce overhead to software development as they can lead to
unnecessary attempts to debug production or testing code. The state-of-the-art
ML-based flaky test case predictors rely on pre-defined sets of features that
are either project-specific, require access to production code, which is not
always available to software test engineers. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose Flakify, a black-box, language model-based predictor for flaky test
cases. Flakify relies exclusively on the source code of test cases, thus not
requiring to (a) access to production code (black-box), (b) rerun test cases,
(c) pre-define features. To this end, we employed CodeBERT, a pre-trained
language model, and fine-tuned it to predict flaky test cases using the source
code of test cases. We evaluated Flakify on two publicly available datasets
(FlakeFlagger and IDoFT) for flaky test cases and compared our technique with
the FlakeFlagger approach using two different evaluation procedures:
cross-validation and per-project validation. Flakify achieved high F1-scores on
both datasets using cross-validation and per-project validation, and surpassed
FlakeFlagger by 10 and 18 percentage points in terms of precision and recall,
respectively, when evaluated on the FlakeFlagger dataset, thus reducing the
cost bound to be wasted on unnecessarily debugging test cases and production
code by the same percentages. Flakify also achieved significantly higher
prediction results when used to predict test cases on new projects, suggesting
better generalizability over FlakeFlagger. Our results further show that a
black-box version of FlakeFlagger is not a viable option for predicting flaky
test cases.

15~R_e$ in the red and blue sub-populations of GCs taken separately. In
addition, we find a negative color gradient when we consider the satellite
low-mass elliptical galaxies as a system, i.e., the satellite galaxies closer
to the center of the host galaxy usually have redder color indices, both for
their stars and GCs. According to the ""two phase"" formation scenario of massive
early-type galaxies, the host galaxy accretes stars and GCs from low-mass
satellite galaxies in the second phase. So the accreted GC system naturally
inherits the negative color gradient present in the satellite population. This
can explain why the color gradient of the GC system can still be observed at
large radii after multiple minor mergers.

weight of the agreement penalty, we get a continuum of solutions that include
the well-known early and late fusion approaches. Cooperative learning chooses
the degree of agreement (or fusion) in an adaptive manner, using a validation

our fitting procedure is modular, where one can choose different fitting
mechanisms (e.g. lasso, random forests, boosting, neural networks) appropriate
for different data views. In the setting of cooperative regularized linear
regression, the method combines the lasso penalty with the agreement penalty,
yielding feature sparsity. The method can be especially powerful when the
different data views share some underlying relationship in their signals that
can be exploited to boost the signals. We show that cooperative learning
achieves higher predictive accuracy on simulated data and a real multiomics

flexible fitting mechanisms for different modalities, cooperative learning
offers a powerful approach to multiomics data fusion.

collected survey and wearable data from 23 students in 10 courses over four

seating proximity between students relate to their perceived learning
engagement? 2. How do students' group seating behaviours relate to their
physiologically-based measures of engagement (i.e. physiological arousal and
physiological synchrony)? Experiment results indicate that the individual and
group-wise classroom seating experience is associated with perceived student
engagement and physiologically-based engagement measured from electrodermal

influence of provided prior information is controlled by non-negative

It is demonstrated that spectral windowing regularization parameters can be

ubiquitous geometric data such as point clouds and graphs, have achieved great
successes in the last decade. One critical inductive bias is that the model can
maintain invariance towards various transformations such as translation,
rotation, and scaling. The existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches can
only maintain permutation-invariance, failing to guarantee invariance with
respect to other transformations. Besides GNNs, other works design
sophisticated transformation-invariant layers, which are computationally
expensive and difficult to be extended. To solve this problem, we revisit why
the existing neural networks cannot maintain transformation invariance when
handling geometric data. Our findings show that transformation-invariant and
distance-preserving initial representations are sufficient to achieve
transformation invariance rather than needing sophisticated neural layer
designs. Motivated by these findings, we propose Transformation Invariant
Neural Networks (TinvNN), a straightforward and general framework for geometric
data. Specifically, we realize transformation-invariant and distance-preserving
initial point representations by modifying multi-dimensional scaling before
feeding the representations into neural networks. We prove that TinvNN can
strictly guarantee transformation invariance, being general and flexible enough
to be combined with the existing neural networks. Extensive experimental
results on point cloud analysis and combinatorial optimization demonstrate the
effectiveness and general applicability of our proposed method. Based on the
experimental results, we advocate that TinvNN should be considered a new
starting point and an essential baseline for further studies of
transformation-invariant geometric deep learning.

However, it still has some shortcomings. Firstly, it suffers from detecting the

the privacy leaks of undefined type. Aiming at solving the above problems, a
new personal information detection method based on traffic monitoring is
proposed in this paper. In this paper, statistical features of personal
information are designed to depict the occurrence patterns of personal

a detector is trained based on machine learning algorithms to discover

features are independent of the value and type of personal information, the

applications. While deep learning has driven much recent progress in medical
imaging, many clinical challenges are not fully addressed, limiting its broader
usage. While recent methods report high diagnostic accuracies, physicians have
concerns trusting these algorithm results for diagnostic decision-making
purposes because of a general lack of algorithm decision reasoning and
interpretability. One potential way to address this problem is to further train
these models to localize abnormalities in addition to just classifying them.
However, doing this accurately will require a large amount of disease
localization annotations by clinical experts, a task that is prohibitively
expensive to accomplish for most applications. In this work, we take a step
towards addressing these issues by means of a new attention-driven weakly
supervised algorithm comprising a hierarchical attention mining framework that
unifies activation- and gradient-based visual attention in a holistic manner.
Our key algorithmic innovations include the design of explicit ordinal
attention constraints, enabling principled model training in a
weakly-supervised fashion, while also facilitating the generation of
visual-attention-driven model explanations by means of localization cues. On
two large-scale chest X-ray datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and CheXpert), we
demonstrate significant localization performance improvements over the current
state of the art while also achieving competitive classification performance.

computer vision tasks. The primary goal of image segmentation is to simplify an
image for easier analysis, and there are two broad approaches for achieving
this: edge based methods, which extract the boundaries of specific known
objects, and region based methods, which partition the image into regions that
are statistically homogeneous. One of the more prominent edge finding methods,
known as the level set method, evolves a zero-level contour in the image plane
with gradient descent until the contour has converged to the object boundaries.
While the classical level set method and its variants have proved successful in
segmenting real images, they are susceptible to becoming stuck in noisy regions
of the image plane without a priori knowledge of the image and they are unable
to provide details beyond object outer boundary locations. We propose a
modification to the variational level set image segmentation method that can
quickly detect object boundaries by making use of random point initialization.
We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by comparing the performance of our

regime for an ensemble of emitters resonantly coupled to a localized surface
plasmon in a metal-dielectric structure. The response of a hybrid system to an
external field is determined by two distinct mechanisms involving collective
states of emitters interacting with the plasmon mode. First is the near-field
coupling between the bright collective state and the plasmon mode which
underpins energy exchange between the system components and gives rise to
exciton-induced transparency minimum in scattering spectra in the weak coupling
regime and to emergence of polaritonic bands as the system transitions to
strong coupling regime. The second mechanism is the Fano interference between
the plasmon dipole moment and plasmon-induced dipole moment of bright
collective state as the hybrid system interacts with the radiation field. The
latter mechanism is greatly facilitated by plasmon-induced coherence in a
system with characteristic size below the diffraction limit as the individual
emitters comprising the collective state are driven by same alternating plasmon
near field and therefore all oscillate in phase. This cooperative effect leads
to scaling of the Fano asymmetry parameter and of the Fano function amplitude
with the ensemble size and therefore it strongly affects the shape of
scattering spectra for large ensembles. Specifically, with increasing emitters
numbers, the Fano interference leads to a spectral weight shift towards the
lower energy polaritonic band.

article is to provide a geometric realization of the linear K-system associated
with solutions to Floer's equation in the Morse-Bott setting. Immediate
consequences (when combined with the abstract theory from [FOOO14]) are
construction of Floer cohomology for periodic Hamiltonian system on general
compact symplectic manifold without any restriction, and construction of an
isomorphism over the Novikov ring between the Floer cohomology and the singular
cohomology of the underlying symplectic manifold. The present article utilizes
various analytical results on pseudo-holomorphic curves established in our
earlier papers and books.
  However the paper itself is geometric in nature, and does not presume the
readers' prior knowledge much on Kuranishi structure and its construction but
assumes only the elementary part of thereof, and results from [FOOO11] and
[FOOO,Chapter 8] on its construction, and the standard knowledge on Hamiltonian
Floer theory. We explain the general procedure of the construction of a linear
K-system by explaining in detail the inductive steps of ensuring the
compatibility conditions for the system of Kuranishi structures leading to a
linear K-system for the case of Hamiltonian Floer theory.

biological tissues. While the effects of chain entanglement on elasticity and
viscoelasticity of polymer networks have been intensively studied, it remains
elusive how chain entanglement affects fracture and fatigue of polymer
networks. In this paper, using polyacrylamide hydrogels as a model material, we
systematically compare fracture toughness and fatigue threshold of polymer
networks with various levels of chain entanglement. We find that the fracture
toughness and fatigue threshold of an unentangled polymer network are almost
the same, although the unentangled polymer network still contains non-ideal
features including topological defects (i.e., dangling chains and cyclic loops)
and structural heterogeneity (i.e., non-uniform chain lengths and non-uniform
functionalities). In contrast, the fracture toughness of an entangled polymer
network can be over ten times (up to 16 times) higher than its fatigue
threshold, indicating substantial toughness enhancement due to chain
entanglement. Different from the conventional toughness enhancement due to bulk
dissipation of polymer networks, the toughness enhancement by chain
entanglement requires low stress-stretch hysteresis (<10%) of the bulk
entangled polymer networks. We attribute the toughness enhancement in entangled
polymer networks to a new dissipation mechanism, near-crack dissipation, which
is possibly induced by pull-out of chains and delocalized damage of chains
around the crack tip.

samples of the random variables are not available, but only the values of the

the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. It is built
on min-max optimization (MMO), where the minimizer (i.e., defender) seeks a
robust model to minimize the worst-case training loss in the presence of
adversarial examples crafted by the maximizer (i.e., attacker). However, the
conventional MMO method makes AT hard to scale. Thus, Fast-AT (Wong et al.,
2020) and other recent algorithms attempt to simplify MMO by replacing its
maximization step with the single gradient sign-based attack generation step.
Although easy to implement, Fast-AT lacks theoretical guarantees, and its
empirical performance is unsatisfactory due to the issue of robust catastrophic
overfitting when training with strong adversaries. In this paper, we advance
Fast-AT from the fresh perspective of bi-level optimization (BLO). We first
show that the commonly-used Fast-AT is equivalent to using a stochastic
gradient algorithm to solve a linearized BLO problem involving a sign
operation. However, the discrete nature of the sign operation makes it
difficult to understand the algorithm performance. Inspired by BLO, we design
and analyze a new set of robust training algorithms termed Fast Bi-level AT
(Fast-BAT), which effectively defends sign-based projected gradient descent
(PGD) attacks without using any gradient sign method or explicit robust
regularization. In practice, we show our method yields substantial robustness

Moreover, we investigate the effect of using different time periods on the

for the different orientations of the image to help the model retain further

of forgetting on the model predictions. However, we cannot directly use the
data-ensemble approach if the model is trained using traditional techniques.
Therefore, we also propose a novel dual-incremental learning framework that
involves jointly training the network with two incremental learning objectives,
i.e., the class-incremental learning objective and our proposed
data-incremental learning objective. In the dual-incremental learning
framework, each image belongs to two classes, i.e., the image class (for
class-incremental learning) and the orientation class (for data-incremental
learning). In class-incremental learning, each new phase introduces a new set
of classes, and the model cannot access the complete training data from the
older phases. In our proposed data-incremental learning, the orientation
classes remain the same across all the phases, and the data introduced by the

  Classification of Wet-AMD",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated diagnosis using deep neural networks can help ophthalmologists
detect the blinding eye disease wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).
Wet-AMD has two similar subtypes, Neovascular AMD and Polypoidal Choroidal
Vessels (PCV). However, due to the difficulty in data collection and the
similarity between images, most studies have only achieved the coarse-grained
classification of wet-AMD rather than a finer-grained one of wet-AMD subtypes.
To solve this issue, in this paper we propose a Knowledge-driven Fine-grained
Wet-AMD Classification Model (KFWC), to classify fine-grained diseases with
insufficient data. With the introduction of a priori knowledge of 10 lesion
signs of input images into the KFWC, we aim to accelerate the KFWC by means of
multi-label classification pre-training, to locate the decisive image features
in the fine-grained disease classification task and therefore achieve better
classification. Simultaneously, the KFWC can also provide good interpretability
and effectively alleviate the pressure of data collection and annotation in the
field of fine-grained disease classification for wet-AMD. The experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the KFWC which reaches 99.71% in AU-ROC
scores, and its considerable improvements over the data-driven w/o Knowledge
and ophthalmologists, with the rates of 6.69% over the strongest baseline and
4.14% over ophthalmologists.

the promise of AI in assisting with such tasks, it remains largely unknown how
AI should be designed to facilitate effective collaboration between user
experience (UX) evaluators and AI. Inspired by the concepts of agency and work
context in human and AI collaboration literature, we studied two corresponding
design factors for AI-assisted UX evaluation: explanations and synchronization.
Explanations allow AI to further inform humans how it identifies UX problems
from a usability test session; synchronization refers to the two ways humans
and AI collaborate: synchronously and asynchronously. We iteratively designed a
tool, AI Assistant, with four versions of UIs corresponding to the two levels
of explanations (with/without) and synchronization (sync/async). By adopting a
hybrid wizard-of-oz approach to simulating an AI with reasonable performance,
we conducted a mixed-method study with 24 UX evaluators identifying UX problems
from usability test videos using AI Assistant. Our quantitative and qualitative
results show that AI with explanations, regardless of being presented
synchronously or asynchronously, provided better support for UX evaluators'
analysis and was perceived more positively; when without explanations,
synchronous AI better improved UX evaluators' performance and engagement
compared to the asynchronous AI. Lastly, we present the design implications for
AI-assisted UX evaluation and facilitating more effective human-AI
collaboration.

devices may be in close proximity to each other, computational tasks with
similar input data for the same services (e.g., image or video annotation) may
be offloaded to the edge. The execution of such tasks often yields the same
results (output) and thus duplicate (redundant) computation. Based on this
observation, prior work has advocated for ""computation reuse"", a paradigm where
the results of previously executed tasks are stored at the edge and are reused
to satisfy incoming tasks with similar input data, instead of executing these
incoming tasks from scratch. However, realizing computation reuse in practical
edge computing deployments, where services may be offered by multiple
(distributed) edge nodes (servers) for scalability and fault tolerance, is
still largely unexplored. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present
Reservoir, a framework to enable pervasive computation reuse at the edge, while
imposing marginal overheads on user devices and the operation of the edge
network infrastructure. Reservoir takes advantage of Locality Sensitive Hashing
(LSH) and runs on top of Named-Data Networking (NDN), extending the NDN
architecture for the realization of the computation reuse semantics in the
network. Our evaluation demonstrated that Reservoir can reuse computation with
up to an almost perfect accuracy, achieving 4.25-21.34x lower task completion
times compared to cases without computation reuse.

multiple input views. Considering the sparsity of the two level features, we
diffuse them into feature volumes in the canonical space to construct neural
radiance fields. Then, we present a signed distance function (SDF) regression

double diffused representations, our method can even synthesize novel views of

Datalog-inspired approaches demonstrate the emerging need to express powerful
code analyses more easily. Declarative program analysis frameworks (e.g., using
logic programming like Datalog) significantly ease defining analyses compared
to imperative implementations. However, the declarative benefits of these
frameworks only materialize after parsing and translating source code to
generate facts. Fact generation remains a non-declarative precursor to analysis
where imperative implementations first parse and interpret program structures
(e.g., abstract syntax trees and control-flow graphs). The procedure of fact
generation thus remains opaque and difficult for non-experts to understand or
modify. We present a new perspective on this analysis workflow by proposing
declarative fact generation to ease specification and exploration of
lightweight declarative analyses. Our approach demonstrates the first venture
towards fully declarative analysis specification across multiple languages. The
key idea is to translate source code directly to Datalog facts in the analysis
domain using declarative syntax transformation. We then reuse existing Datalog
analyses over generated facts, yielding an end-to-end declarative pipeline. As
a first approximation we pursue a syntax-driven approach and demonstrate the
feasibility of generating and using lightweight versions of liveness and call
graph reachability properties. We then discuss the workability of extending
declarative fact generation to also incorporate semantic information.

brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). This can be an arduous learning process
especially for motor imagery BCI. Various training methods were proposed to
assist users in accomplishing BCI control and increase performance. Notably the
use of biased feedback, i.e. non-realistic representation of performance.
Benefits of biased feedback on performance and learning vary between users
(e.g. depending on their initial level of BCI control) and remain speculative.
To disentangle the speculations, we investigate what personality type, initial
state and calibration performance (CP) could benefit from a biased feedback.
Methods. We conduct an experiment (n=30 for 2 sessions). The feedback provided
to each group (n=10) is either positively, negatively or not biased. Results.
Statistical analyses suggest that interactions between bias and: 1) workload,
2) anxiety, and 3) self-control significantly affect online performance. For
instance, low initial workload paired with negative bias is associated to
higher peak performances (86%) than without any bias (69%). High anxiety
relates negatively to performance no matter the bias (60%), while low anxiety
matches best with negative bias (76%). For low CP, learning rate (LR) increases
with negative bias only short term (LR=2%) as during the second session it
severely drops (LR=-1%). Conclusion. We unveil many interactions between said
human factors and bias. Additionally, we use prediction models to confirm and
reveal even more interactions. Significance. This paper is a first step towards
identifying optimal biased feedback for a personality type, state, and CP in
order to maximize BCI performance and learning.

problem which aims at separating the foreground object from the background in

Most of the previous UVOS models use the first frame or the entire video as a
reference frame to specify the mask of the foreground object. Our question is
why the first frame should be selected as a reference frame or why the entire
video should be used to specify the mask. We believe that we can select a
better reference frame to achieve the better UVOS performance than using only
the first frame or the entire video as a reference frame. In our paper, we
propose Easy Frame Selector (EFS). The EFS enables us to select an 'easy'

the VOS performance. Furthermore, we propose a new framework named as Iterative
Mask Prediction (IMP). In the framework, we repeat applying EFS to the given

previous iteration, increasing the VOS performance incrementally. The IMP
consists of EFS, Bi-directional Mask Prediction (BMP), and Temporal Information

overlapped frames, the proposed DADCFs require a reduced amount of 1)
computational complexity, 2) memory usage, and 3) global memory access. These
characteristics are strongly required for current high-resolution image
processing. Specifically, we propose two DADCFs based on discrete cosine

constructed from parallel separable transforms of DCT and DST, where the DST is
permuted by row. The second DADCF is also designed based on DCT and DST, while
the DST is customized to have no DC leakage property which is a desirable
property for image processing. Both DADCFs have rich directional selectivity
with slightly different characteristics each other and they can be implemented
as non-overlapping block-based transforms, especially they form Parseval block

qubits produces the desired Hamiltonian in the rotating frame, and we can use
such an interaction for the quantum annealing while the microwave fields

Measured P-wave modulus showed a significant decline while more soft particles
are added due to a change in microstructure. However, for small contents of
soft particles, it could be observed that the P-wave modulus is increasing. For
the understanding of such kinds of effects, detailed insight into the
microstructure of the system is required. To gain this information and link it
to the effective properties, we made use of high-resolution micro X-ray
Computed Tomography (micro-XRCT) imaging and combined it with the classical
stiffness characterization. Both performed in situ meaning inside the
laboratory-based XRCT scanner. With micro-XRCT imaging, the granular
microstructure can be visualized in 3d and characterized subsequently. By
post-processing of the data, the individual grains of the particulate systems
could be uniquely identified. Finally, the contact network of the packings
which connects the center of particles was established to demonstrate the
network transition from stiff- to soft-dominated regimes. This has allowed for
unprecedented observations and a renewed understanding of particulate systems.

we look at CNF formulas for which very small circuits exists and look at the
efficiency of their bottom-up compilation in one of the most general languages,

prove that, while the inputs have constant size representations as str-DNNF,
any bottom-up compilation in the general setting where conjunction and

to rectify active particles at one-body level, creating a net current in the
`easy direction'. This is the direction in which one encounters the lower
maximum force en route to the top of a potential barrier. The exclusion
constraint results in single-file motion, so the mean velocities of active and
passive particles are identical; we study the effects of activity level,
Brownian diffusivity, particle size, initial sequence of active and passive
particles, and active/passive concentration ratio on this mean velocity (i.e.,
the current per particle). We show that in some parameter regimes the sign of
the current is reversed. This happens when the passive particles are at high
temperature and so would cross barriers relatively easily, and without
rectification, except that they collide with `cold' active ones, which would
otherwise be localized near the potential minima. In this case, the reversed
current arises because hot passive particles push cold active ones
preferentially in the direction with the lower spatial separation between the
bottom and top of the barrier. A qualitatively similar mechanism operates in a
mixture containing passive particles of two very different temperatures,
although there is no quantitative mapping between that case and the systems

learning. Despite the existence of modern optimization algorithms that minimize
the number of evaluations needed, evaluations of a single setting may still be
expensive. Usually a resampling technique is used, where the machine learning
method has to be fitted a fixed number of k times on different training
datasets. The respective mean performance of the k fits is then used as
performance estimator. Many hyperparameter settings could be discarded after
less than k resampling iterations if they are clearly inferior to
high-performing settings. However, resampling is often performed until the very
end, wasting a lot of computational effort. To this end, we propose the
Sequential Random Search (SQRS) which extends the regular random search
algorithm by a sequential testing procedure aimed at detecting and eliminating
inferior parameter configurations early. We compared our SQRS with regular
random search using multiple publicly available regression and classification
datasets. Our simulation study showed that the SQRS is able to find similarly
well-performing parameter settings while requiring noticeably fewer
evaluations. Our results underscore the potential for integrating sequential
tests into hyperparameter tuning.

enhancement of excitation-energy transfer (EET) in a molecular system with an

emission of light in which photons are bosonic particles, a greater rate of EET
is observed if the group of acceptors is prepared in the exciton-polariton BEC
state than if the acceptors are initially either in their electronic ground
states or in a normal excited state with an equal average number of molecular
excitations. The Bose enhancement also manifests itself as the growth of the
EET rate with an increasing number of exciton polaritons in the BEC. Finally, a
permutation-symmetry-based approach to suppress the EET to the huge manifold of
dark states in the acceptor group is proposed to facilitate the Bose-enhanced
EET to the polariton BEC.

However, prior work, using different randomization tests, has shown that
interpretations generated by these methods may not be robust. For instance,
models making the same predictions on the test set may still lead to different
feature importance rankings. In order to address the lack of robustness of
token-based interpretability, we explore explanations at higher semantic levels
like sentences. We use computational metrics and human subject studies to
compare the quality of sentence-based interpretations against token-based ones.
Our experiments show that higher-level feature attributions offer several
advantages: 1) they are more robust as measured by the randomization tests, 2)
they lead to lower variability when using approximation-based methods like
SHAP, and 3) they are more intelligible to humans in situations where the
linguistic coherence resides at a higher granularity level. Based on these
findings, we show that token-based interpretability, while being a convenient

is a very good approximation for all these cases and, apart from $k=1$, shows a
deviation below one percent. These findings are corroborated with Monte-Carlo

aerodynamic forces and torques are computed assuming a spherically symmetric
expanding gas. The calculations are limited to particle sizes in the geometric
optics limit, which is the range of validity of our radiative torque
calculations. The dynamical behaviour of irregular particles is quite different
to those exhibited by non-spherical but symmetric particles such as spheroids.
An application of the dynamical model to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the
target of the Rosetta mission, is made. We found that, for particle sizes
larger than about 10 micrometer, the radiative torques are negligible in
comparison with the gas-driven torques up to a distance of about 100 km from
the nucleus surface. The rotation frequencies of the particles depend on their
size, shape, and the heliocentric distance, while the terminal velocities,
being also dependent on size and heliocentric distance, show only a very weak
dependence on particle shape. The ratio of the sum of the particles projected
areas in the sun-to-comet direction to that of the sum of the particles
projected areas in any direction perpendicular to it is nearly unity,

the surface of Solar System small bodies from the viewpoint of nonlinear
dynamics. We propose an approximation model for secular mass movement, which
combines the complex topography and irregular gravitational field. Choosing
asteroid 101955 Bennu as a representative, the global change of the dynamical
environment is examined, which presents a division of the
creeping-sliding-shedding regions for a spun-up asteroid. In the creeping
region, the dynamical equation of disturbed regolith grains is established
based on the assumption of ""trigger-slide"" motion mode. The equilibrium points,
local manifolds and large-scale trajectories of the system are calculated to
clarify the dynamical characteristics of long-term regolith movement.
Generally, we find for a low spin rate, the surface regolith grains flow toward
the middle latitudes from the polar/equatorial regions, which is dominated by
the gradient of the geopotential. While spun up to a high rate, regolith grains
tend to migrate toward the equator, which happens in parallel with a
topological shift of the local equilibria at low latitudes. From a long-term
perspective, we find the equilibrium points dominate the global trends of
regolith movements. Using the methodology developed in this paper, we give a
prospect or retrospect to the secular motion of regolith materials during the
spin-up process, and the results reveal a significant regulatory role of the
equilibria. Through a detailed look at the dynamical scheme under different
spin rates, we achieve a macro forecast of the global trends of regolith motion
during the spin-up process, which explains the global geologic evolution driven
by the long-term movements of regolith materials.

meta-analytical structural equation modeling approach, presenting a
meta-analysis of studies on residential PV adoption intention, and assessing
four behavioral models based on the theory of planned behavior to advance
theory development. Of 653 initially identified studies, 110 remained for
full-text screening. Only eight studies were sufficiently homogeneous, provided
bivariate correlations, and could thus be integrated into the meta-analysis.The
pooled correlations across primary studies revealed medium to large
correlations between environmental concern, novelty seeking, perceived
benefits, subjective norm and intention to adopt a residential PV system,
whereas socio-demographic variables were uncorrelated with intention.
Meta-analytical structural equation modeling revealed a model (N = 1,714) in
which adoption intention was predicted by benefits and perceived behavioral
control, and benefits in turn could be explained by environmental concern,
novelty seeking, and subjective norm. Our results imply that measures should
primarily focus on enhancing the perception of benefits. Based on obstacles we
encountered within the analysis, we suggest guidelines to facilitate the future

of the geometries to stabiliser codes. We construct analogues of the HaPPY code
for three-dimensional hyperbolic space (AdS$_4$), using both absolutely
maximally entangled (AME) and non-AME codes. These codes are based on uniform
regular tessellations of hyperbolic space but we note that AME codes that
preserve the discrete symmetry of the polytope of the tessellation do not exist
above two dimensions. We also explore different constructions of stabiliser
codes for hyperbolic spaces in which the logical information is associated with
the boundary and discuss their potential interpretation. We explain how our
codes could be applied to interesting classes of holographic dualities based on
gravity-scalar theories (such as JT gravity) through toroidal reductions of

of galactic Dark Matter (DM) even in the presence of an irreducible background

direction of a DM-induced nuclear recoil in the keV-range. To probe such low
energies, directional detectors must operate at high gain where 3D track
reconstruction can be distorted by the influence of the numerous ions produced
in the avalanches. The article describes the interplay between electrons and
ions during signal formation in a Micromegas. It introduces SimuMimac, a
simulation tool dedicated to high gain detection that agrees with MIMAC
measurements. This work proposes an analytical formula to deconvolve the ionic
signal induced on the grid from any measurements, with no need for prior nor ad
hoc parameter. This deconvolution is experimentally tested and validated,
revealing the fine structure of the primary electrons cloud and consequently
leading to head-tail recognition in the keV-range. Finally, the article
presents how this deconvolution can be used for directionality by
reconstructing the spectra of mono-energetic $27~\mathrm{keV}$ and
$8~\mathrm{keV}$ neutrons with an angular resolution better than $15^\circ$.
This novel approach for directionality appears as complementary to the standard
one from 3D tracks reconstruction and offers redundancy for improving
directional performances at high gain in the keV region.

eliminating the need of complicated data pre/post-processing and with less

In 3LSPD-C, a single production plant delivers items to the warehouses from
where they are distributed to their corresponding retailers. There is a
capacity on the total amount the plant can produce in each period, whereas
there are no capacities on transportation. The goal of the problem consists in
determining an integrated three-echelon production and distribution plan
minimizing the total cost, which is composed of fixed costs for production and
transportation setups as well as variable inventory holding costs.
Additionally, we consider a generalization of the problem which also
establishes storage capacities on the warehouses and/or retailers, given the
importance of such characteristics in practical industrial and commercial
environments. Such extension is denoted generalized capacitated three-level
lot-sizing and replenishment problem with a distribution structure (G3LSPD-C).
We propose a hybrid mixed integer programming (MIP) heuristic consisting of a
relax-and-fix approach to generate initial feasible solutions and a
fix-and-optimize improvement procedure grounded on varying-size neighborhoods
to obtain high-quality solutions. Computational experiments are performed to
analyze the potential cost reductions achieved using the new hybrid heuristic
when compared with a state-of-the-art MIP formulation. The results show that
the proposed hybrid heuristic can match or improve the solution quality
obtained by the MIP formulation for the majority of the 3LSPD-C instances.
Additionally, such superior behavior remains valid when the approaches are

drug delivery process in which the drug molecules are released toward the
target (receiver) in a way that the side effects are minimized in the human

receive all of the transmitted drug molecules. Therefore, the molecules would
be accumulated in the system which results in side effects in the body. In
order to diagnose the appropriate transmission rate of the drug molecules, it
is important to investigate the reception process of the receiver. In this
paper, a reception model is studied using queuing theory. In the proposed
model, the rejection rate of the drug molecules due to different reasons, such
as random movement of the molecules, as well as the rejection rate due to
active receptors are taken into account. Moreover, an interval consisting of

clathrate by ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics. The system under
pressure first undergoes amorphization followed by an ultrafast
recrystallization to the $\beta$-tin structure on the time scale of 30 ps. The
initial pressure-induced amorphization of clathrate is triggered by high
pressure while the subsequent fast recrystallization to $\beta$-tin is driven
by low temperature. Interestingly, the amorphous intermediate is still
diffusive even at room temperature, in spite of very strong undercooling,
making the ultrafast recrystallization possible. The system provides an
explicit example of structural transformation between two crystalline phases
proceeding via non-crystalline intermediate. Upon fast decompression of the
amorphous structure with incipient crystalline order the recrystallization is
blocked and the system instead proceeds to the tetrahedral LDA amorphous phase.

observing the Ramsey-type oscillations of the ion spin states. I show that due
to the presence of non-linear phonon coupling the off-resonance interaction
between the ion spin states and the axial breathing mode leads to
spin-dependent phonon squeezing of the radial rocking mode. Thus the non-linear
coupling can be estimated by measuring population distribution of the motional
squeezed state. Furthermore, I show that the off-resonance interaction between
the spin and the radial rocking mode creates a spin-dependent beam splitter
operation between the two vibrational modes. Thus, the parameter estimation can
be carried out by detecting the ion spin populations. Finally, I show that the
measurement uncertainty precision can reach the Heisenberg limit by using an
entangled states between the two collective modes.

the dispersion of particles and solutes in such disordered systems has been
only poorly understood, in part due to the stagnant and opaque nature of these

problem to reduce the number of tests required for identifying the virus
carriers in order to contain the viral spread while preserving the tests
reliability. To cope with this issue, a prevalence testing paradigm based on
group testing and compressive sensing approach or GTCS was examined. In these
settings, a non-adaptive group testing algorithm is designed to rule out
sure-negative samples. Then, on the reduced problem, a compressive sensing
algorithm is applied to decode the positives without requiring any further
testing besides the initial test matrix designed for the group testing phase.
The result is a single-round non-adaptive group testing - compressive sensing
algorithm to identify the positive samples.
  In this paper, we propose a heuristic random method to construct the test
design called $\alpha-$random row design or $\alpha-$RRD. In the $\alpha-$RRD,
a random test matrix is constructed such that each test aggregates at most
$\alpha$ samples in one group test or pool. The pooled tests are heuristically
selected one by one such that samples that were previously selected in the same
test are less likely to be aggregated together in a new test. We examined the
performance of the $\alpha-$RRD design within the GTCS paradigm for several
values of $\alpha$. The experiments were conducted on synthetic data. Our
results show that, for some values of $\alpha$, a reduction of up to 10 fold in
the tests number can be achieved when $\alpha-$RRD design is applied in the
GTCS paradigm.

1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylide in the liquid phase. The
comparison between 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and N,N-dimethylformamide as
dispersant solvents, and between sonication and homogenization as dispersion
techniques, proves N,N-dimethylformamide and homogenization as the most
effective choice. The functionalization of graphene nanosheets and reduced
graphene oxide is confirmed using different techniques. Among them,
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy allows to map the pyrrolidine ring of the
azomethine ylide on the surface of functionalized graphene, while micro-Raman
spectroscopy detects new features arising from the functionalization, which are
described in agreement with the power spectrum obtained from ab initio
molecular dynamics simulation. Moreover, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy of
functionalized graphene allows the quantitative elemental analysis and the
estimation of the surface coverage, showing a higher degree of
functionalization for reduced graphene oxide. This more reactive behavior
originates from the localization of partial charges on its surface due to the
presence of oxygen defects, as shown by the simulation of the electrostatic
features. Functionalization of graphene using 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is
shown to be a significant step towards the controlled synthesis of
graphene-based complex structures and devices at the nanoscale.

(AMVDSN), which deeply explores underlying consistent and view-specific
information from multiple views and fuse them by considering each view's
dynamic contribution obtained by attention mechanism. Unlike most multi-view
subspace learning methods that they directly reconstruct data points on raw
data or only consider consistency or complementarity when learning
representation in deep or shallow space, our proposed method seeks to find a
joint latent representation that explicitly considers both consensus and
view-specific information among multiple views, and then performs subspace
clustering on learned joint latent representation.Besides, different views
contribute differently to representation learning, we therefore introduce
attention mechanism to derive dynamic weight for each view, which performs much
better than previous fusion methods in the field of multi-view subspace
clustering. The proposed algorithm is intuitive and can be easily optimized
just by using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) because of the neural network
framework, which also provides strong non-linear characterization capability
compared with traditional subspace clustering approaches. The experimental
results on seven real-world data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of
our proposed algorithm against some state-of-the-art subspace learning
approaches.

obtain exact solutions of the eigenvalue equation and very good approximations
of the internal dynamics of the interacting atom-light system. In this article,
two symmetry operators, characterized as ""duality"" symmetry operators, have
been introduced which transform the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian into duality
conjugates. The parity and duality symmetry operators constitute an
algebraically closed set of symmetry transformation operators of the quantum
Rabi model. The closed $SU(2)$ Lie algebra provides the standard eigenvalues
and eigenstates of the parity symmetry operator. It is established that
Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings operators are duality symmetry
conjugates. Symmetric or antisymmetric linear combinations of the Rabi
Hamiltonian and a corresponding duality conjugate yield the familiar
spin-dependent force driven bosonic , coupling-only or quantized light mode
quadrature-driven fermionic Hamiltonian. It is established that the effective
bosonic, fermionic and coupling-only Hamiltonians are exact, not approximate
forms of the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian as they have generally been interpreted.
The effective bosonic form generates the dynamics of the light mode driven by
the atomic spin-dependent force, while the fermionic form generates the
dynamics of the atomic spin driven by the quantized light mode
quadrature-dependent force, thus providing a complete picture of the quantum
Rabi dynamics.

Furthermore, we give results for the pair production of a SM-like with a

We identify several populations of interest that reflect a variety of

clusters instead of three further divides quiescent galaxies, while star
forming ones are mostly contained in a single cluster, demonstrating a variety
of supported pathways to quenching. In addition to these populations, we

builds upon neural forms, which employ the differential equation with a
discretisation of the solution domain. Making use of neural forms for
time-dependent differential equations, one can apply the recently developed
method of domain fragmentation. That is, the domain may be split into several
subdomains, on which the optimisation problem is solved. In classic adaptive
numerical methods, the mesh as well as the domain may be refined or decomposed,
respectively, in order to improve accuracy. Also the degree of approximation
accuracy may be adapted. It would be desirable to transfer such important and
successful strategies to the field of neural network based solutions. In the
present work, we propose a novel adaptive neural approach to meet this aim for
solving time-dependent problems. To this end, each subdomain is reduced in size
until the optimisation is resolved up to a predefined training accuracy. In
addition, while the neural networks employed are by default small, we propose a
means to adjust also the number of neurons in an adaptive way. We introduce
conditions to automatically confirm the solution reliability and optimise
computational parameters whenever it is necessary. Results are provided for

first law of black hole dynamics, for improved charged spherically symmetric
spacetimes in contrast to a previous no-go result for axially symmetric ones

a loss of mass which can be interpreted as a consequence of the antiscreening

has examined the system-level effects of soft errors on the availability and

effects of soft errors occurring in the server processors of storage

implemented the major functions of a typical data storage system controller,
running on a full stack of storage system operating system, and developed a

We then propose a new metric, Storage System Vulnerability Factor (SSVF), to
accurately capture the impact of soft errors in storage systems. By conducting
extensive experiments, it is revealed that depending on the controller

making and across many scientific fields. Most recently, mobility data was
extensively used during the COVID-19 pandemic to study the effects of

often measured using digital tools such as mobile phones. However, it remains
an open question how truthfully these digital proxies represent the actual
travel behavior of the general population. Here, we examine mobility datasets
from multiple countries and identify two fundamentally different types of bias
caused by unequal access to, and unequal usage of mobile phones. We introduce
the concept of data generation bias, a previously overlooked type of bias,
which is present when the amount of data that an individual produces influences
their representation in the dataset. We find evidence for data generation bias
in all examined datasets in that high-wealth individuals are overrepresented,
with the richest 20% contributing over 50% of all recorded trips, substantially
skewing the datasets. This inequality is consequential, as we find mobility
patterns of different wealth groups to be structurally different, where the
mobility networks of high-wealth users are denser and contain more long-range
connections. To mitigate the skew, we present a framework to debias data and
show how simple techniques can be used to increase representativeness. Using
our approach we show how biases can severely impact outcomes of dynamic
processes such as epidemic simulations, where biased data incorrectly estimates
the severity and speed of disease transmission. Overall, we show that a failure
to account for biases can have detrimental effects on the results of studies

multiple-degeneracy generalization of the usual Janeys-Cummings model for
two-level atoms. By standard Wigner-Wiesskopf approximation, we show that for
the first one or few particles' radiation our model yields completely the same
power spectrum as hawking radiation requires. While in the many-particle
radiation cases, numeric methods allow us to follow the evolution of
microscopic state of a black hole exactly, from which we can get the firstly
increasing then decreasing entropy variation trend for the radiation particles
just as the Page-curve exhibited. Basing on this model analysis, we claim that
two ingredients are necessary for resolutions of the information missing
puzzle, a spontaneous radiation like mechanism for the production of hawking
particles and proper account of the macroscopic superposition happening in the
full quantum description of a black hole radiation evolution and, the working
logic of replica wormholes is an effect account of this latter ingredient.
  As the basis for our interpretation of black hole Hawking radiation as their
spontaneous radiation, we also provide a fully atomic like inner structure
models for their microscopic states definition and origins of their
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, that is, exact solution families to the Einstein
equation sourced by matter constituents oscillating across the central point
and their quantization. Such a first quantization model for black holes'
microscopic state is non necessary for our spontaneous radiation description,
but has advantages comparing with other alternatives, such as string theory
fuzzball or brick wall models.

can be interpreted by the Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model. In this paper we will
show that aided by a specifically designed temperature field, stick-slip can be
used to extract energy from the environment, i.e. forming a stochastic heat
engine based on PT model (PTSHE). Utilizing Langevin dynamics simulation and
the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, two mechanisms of work output, i.e.
the potential mechanism and the thermolubricity mechanism, are distinguished.
An approximate mean cycle work output limit based on the former one is derived,
reminiscent of Carnot's limit. The latter one can make the mean cycle work
output limit larger than that predicted by the former one while the excess of
it can also lead to work output reduction. The mean cycle work curves with
respect to the driving velocity is characteristic of PT model in both the PTSHE
and nanofriction. The nonlinear bifurcation in zero temperature and the
stochastic resonance in finite temperature of the PT model are analyzed
preliminarily. With the corrugation number of the PT model increasing, the mean
cycle work output limit first increases and then decreases. Besides stick-slip
nanofriction and the PTSHE, the PT model is a promising system for studying
nonlinear double- or multiple-well dynamics and is valuable to be explored

spin-vortex created by the itinerant electrons with a doped hole at its center.
The direction of each SVILC can be either clockwise (winding number is -1) or
counterclockwise (winding number is +1) and the winding number with no current
(winding number is zero) is forbidden by the singlevalued requirement of the
wave function with respect to the electron coordinates. Recently, it has been
demonstrated, theoretically, that this degree-of-freedom can be used for
qubits. Coupling of neighboring qubits by external current feeding is confirmed
to be realizable. This means that nano-sized couplers of SVILC qubits using
feeding external currents are realizable. The size of couplers of SVILC qubits
can be conparable or smaller than that of trapped ion qubits. Couper size of
SVILC qubits is decided by the range of spin vortices in CuO$_2$ plane and

substituting Cu atoms in barrier atoms. That of trapped ion qubits is limited
by the distance that combined vibration occurs or laser range with respect to

motivated by the supercurvature dark energy model in Nan et al. [Phys. Rev. D

of the probability scores per pixel/voxel of the image. Furthermore, we show
that convex combinations of calibrated classifiers preserve volume estimation,
but do not preserve calibration. Therefore, we conclude that having a
calibrated predictor is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for obtaining
an unbiased estimate of the volume. We validate our theoretical findings
empirically on a collection of 18 different (calibrated) training strategies on
the tasks of glioma volume estimation on BraTS 2018, and ischemic stroke lesion
volume estimation on ISLES 2018 datasets.

geometry while simultaneously selecting a suitable material. For a certain
class of simple problems, the two are separable where, for example, one can
first select an optimal material, and then optimize the geometry. However, in
general, the two are not separable. Furthermore, the discrete nature of
material selection is not compatible with gradient-based geometry optimization,
making simultaneous optimization challenging.
  In this paper, we propose the use of variational autoencoders (VAE) for
simultaneous optimization. First, a data-driven VAE is used to project the
discrete material database onto a continuous and differentiable latent space.
This is then coupled with a fully-connected neural network, embedded with a
finite-element solver, to simultaneously optimize the material and geometry.
The neural-network's built-in gradient optimizer and back-propagation are
exploited during optimization.
  The proposed framework is demonstrated using trusses, where an optimal

the cross-sectional areas of the truss members. Several numerical examples
illustrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The Python code used in

formulated on the Keldysh closed-time path. Our test-bed system is the quartic
anharmonic oscillator, a single self-interacting bosonic degree of freedom,
coupled to an external heat bath providing dissipation analogous to the
Caldeira-Leggett model. As our benchmark we use the spectral function from
exact diagonalization with constant Ohmic damping. To extend the GSA for the
open system, we solve the corresponding Heisenberg-Langevin equations in the
Gaussian approximation. For the real-time FRG, we introduce a novel general
prescription to construct causal regulators based on introducing
scale-dependent fictitious heat baths. Our results explicitly demonstrate how
the discrete transition lines of the quantum system gradually build up the
broad continuous structures in the classical spectral function as temperature
increases. At sufficiently high temperatures, classical, GSA and
exact-diagonalization results all coincide. The real-time FRG is able to
reproduce the effective thermal mass, but overestimates broadening and only
qualitatively describes higher excitations, at the present order of our
combined vertex and loop expansion. As temperature is lowered, the GSA follows
the ensemble average of the exact solution better than the classical spectral
function. In the low-temperature strong-coupling regime, the qualitative
features of the exact result are best captured by our real-time FRG
calculation, with quantitative improvements to be expected at higher truncation
orders.

in the realm of Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL). Most generative ZSL methods use
category semantic attributes plus a Gaussian noise to generate visual features.
After generating unseen samples, this family of approaches effectively
transforms the ZSL problem into a supervised classification scheme. However,
the existing models use a single semantic attribute, which contains the
complete attribute information of the category. The generated data also carry
the complete attribute information, but in reality, visual samples usually have
limited attributes. Therefore, the generated data from attribute could have
incomplete semantics. Based on this fact, we propose a novel framework to boost
ZSL by synthesizing diverse features. This method uses augmented semantic
attributes to train the generative model, so as to simulate the real
distribution of visual features. We evaluate the proposed model on four
benchmark datasets, observing significant performance improvement against the

HDD RAID cannot be applied to SSD arrays, as the nature of failures in SSDs are
different from HDDs. Previous studies on the reliability of SSD arrays are
based on the deprecated SSD failure data, and only focus on limited failure
types, device failures, and page failures caused by the bit errors, while
recent field studies have reported other failure types including bad blocks and
bad chips, and a high correlation between failures. In this paper, we explore
the reliability of SSD arrays using field storage traces and real-system
implementation of conventional and emerging erasure codes. The reliability is
evaluated by statistical fault injections that post-process the usage logs from
the real-system implementation, while the fault/failure attributes are obtained
from field data. As a case study, we examine conventional and emerging erasure
codes in terms of both reliability and performance using Linux MD RAID and
commercial SSDs. Our analysis shows that a) emerging erasure codes fail to
replace RAID6 in terms of reliability, b) row-wise erasure codes are the most
efficient choices for contemporary SSD devices, and c) previous models
overestimate the SSD array reliability by up to six orders of magnitude, as
they focus on the coincidence of bad pages and bad chips that roots the
minority of Data Loss (DL) in SSD arrays. Our experiments show that the
combination of bad chips with bad blocks is the major source of DL in RAID5 and
emerging codes (contributing more than 54% and 90% of DL in RAID5 and emerging
codes, respectively), while RAID6 remains robust under these failure
combinations. Finally, the fault injection results show that SSD array
reliability, as well as the failure breakdown is significantly correlated with
SSD type.

We find that distances based on Gaia EDR3 data are more consistent with

only for O but also for the rest of elements -- are not affected by the
abundance discrepancy problem and give elemental abundances much consistent
with the solar ones for most elements. We find that our radial abundance
gradient of He is consistent with the most accurate estimates of the primordial
He abundance. We do not find evidence of azimuthal variations in the chemical

source by the Whipple telescope, the field experienced a revolution mainly
driven by the third generation of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
(IACTs). The combined use of large mirrors and the invention of the imaging
technique at the Whipple telescope, stereoscopic observations, developed by the
HEGRA array and the fine-grained camera, pioneered by the CAT telescope, led to
a jump by a factor of more than ten in sensitivity. The advent of advanced
analysis techniques led to a vast improvement in background rejection, as well
as in angular and energy resolutions. Recent instruments already have to deal
with a very large amount of data (petabytes), containing a large number of
sources often very extended (at least within the Galactic plane) and
overlapping each other, and the situation will become even more dramatic with
future instruments. The first large catalogues of sources have emerged during
the last decade, which required numerous, dedicated observations and
developments, but also made the first population studies possible. This paper
is an attempt to summarize the evolution of the field towards the building up
of the source catalogues, to describe the first population studies already made
possible, and to give some perspectives in the context of the upcoming, new
generation of instruments.

expansion of the Universe. This setup can be realized, if the scale of
spontaneous symmetry breaking is induced dynamically through the interaction
with hot primordial plasma. In that case, the domain wall tension can attain
large values in the early Universe without any conflict with observations.
Owing to the large initial tension, these topological defects may serve as a
powerful source of gravitational waves. We make a preliminary estimate of the
gravitational wave spectrum and argue that it is distinct from the spectrum
produced by other sources, in particular by domain walls of a constant tension.
The resulting gravitational wave signal is in the range accessible by Einstein
Telescope, DECIGO, TianQin, LISA, IPTA, or SKA, if the field constituting the
domain walls is very feebly coupled with hot primordial plasma and has tiny
self-interactions. In particular, one can consider this field for the role of
Dark Matter. We discuss various Dark Matter production mechanisms and
properties of the emitted gravitational waves associated with them. We find
that the conventional freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms lead to large and
perhaps unobservable frequency of gravitational waves. However, the Dark Matter
production is also possible at the second order phase transition leading to the
domain wall formation or at the inverse phase transition, when the domain walls
get dissolved eventually. In both cases, there is essentially no lower bound on
the frequency of emitted gravitational waves.

that this emission is generated through b-polarized excitation at 2.3 eV. The

results are fully consistent with DFT calculations of the permittivity tensor

existence of an action functional. Incorporating variational structure into
learning algorithms for dynamical systems is, therefore, crucial in order to
make sure that the learned model shares important features with the exact
physical system. In this paper we show how to incorporate variational
principles into trajectory predictions of learned dynamical systems. The
novelty of this work is that (1) our technique relies only on discrete position

need to be observed or approximated and {\em no} prior knowledge about the form
of the variational principle is assumed. Instead, they are recovered using
backward error analysis. (2) Moreover, our technique compensates discretisation
errors when trajectories are computed from the learned system. This is
important when moderate to large step-sizes are used and high accuracy is
required. For this, we introduce and rigorously analyse the concept of inverse
modified Lagrangians by developing an inverse version of variational backward
error analysis. (3) Finally, we introduce a method to perform system

little attention in the literature. Using a novel laboratory experiment, we
create a working environment in which first movers can (or cannot) observe

standard repeated sequential Prisoner's Dilemma, where the second mover can
observe the choices made by first movers either exogenously or endogenously. We
show that mutual cooperation occurs significantly more frequently when

role of conditional cooperators (who are more likely to monitor) in promoting

monitoring actions that carry information about first movers who use it to
better screen the type of their co-player and thereby reduce the risk of being

Planetesimal accretion during the phase of planetary migration could lead to
the delivery of heavy elements into giant planets. In our previous paper
(Shibata et al. 2020) we showed that planetesimal accretion during planetary
migration occurs in a rather narrow region of the protoplanetary disk, which we
refer as ""the sweet spot for accretion"". The goal of this paper is to reveal
the nature of the sweet spot and investigate the role of the sweet spot in
determining the composition of gas giant planets. We analytically derive the
required conditions for the sweet spot. Then, we compare the derived equations
with the numerical simulations. We find that the conditions required for the
sweet spot can be expressed by the ratio of the gas damping timescale of the
planetesimal orbits and the planetary migration timescale. If the planetary
migration timescale depends on the surface density of disk gas inversely, the
location of the sweet spot does not change with the disk evolution. The mass of
planetesimals accreted by the planet depends on the amount of planetesimals
that are shepherded by mean motion resonances. Our analysis suggests that tens
Earth-mass of planetesimals can be shepherded into the sweet spot without
planetesimal collisions. However, as more planetesimals are trapped into mean
motion resonances, collisional cascade can lead to fragmentation of
planetesimals. This could affect the location of the sweet spot and the
population of small objects in planetary systems. We conclude that the
composition of gas giant planets depends on whether the planets crossed the
sweet spot during their formation. Constraining the metallicity of cold giant
planets, that are expected to be outer than the sweet spot, would reveal key
information for understanding the origin of heavy elements in giant planets.

scattering systems with partial escape is investigated. We introduce a local
randomization on phase space for the baker map with escape, which separates the
smallest multifractal scale from the scale of the Planck cell. This allows for
deriving a semiclassical description of resonance states based on a local
random vector model and conditional invariance. We numerically demonstrate that
the resulting classical measures perfectly describe resonance states of all
decay rates $\gamma$ for the randomized baker map. By decreasing the scale of
randomization these results are compared to the deterministic baker map with
partial escape. This gives the best available description of its resonance
states. Quantitative differences indicate that a semiclassical description for
deterministic chaotic systems must take into account that the multifractal
structures persist down to the Planck scale.

demonstrate that the existence of an optimal condition for power transmission,

for engineering NDTC: the heat flux is reduced when the temperature increase is
associated to an abrupt change of the electrode's impedance. As a case study,
we analyze a hybrid structure based on thin-film technology, in which the
increased resistance is due to a superconductor-resistive phase transition. For

system events and activities with their timestamps. Before obtaining more
insights into the run-time status of the software, a fundamental step of log
analysis, called log parsing, is employed to extract structured templates and
parameters from the semi-structured raw log messages. However, current log
parsers are all syntax-based and regard each message as a character string,
ignoring the semantic information included in parameters and templates.
  Thus, we propose the semantic-based parser SemParser to unlock the critical
bottleneck of mining semantics from log messages. It contains two steps, an
end-to-end semantic miner and a joint parser. Specifically, the first step aims
to identify explicit semantics inside a single log, and the second step is
responsible for jointly inferring implicit semantics and computing structural
outputs based on the contextual knowledge base. To analyze the effectiveness of
our semantic parser, we first demonstrate that it can derive rich semantics
from log messages collected from six widely-applied systems with an average F1
score of 0.985. Then, we conduct two representative downstream tasks, showing
that current downstream models improve their performance with appropriately
extracted semantics by 1.2%-11.7% and 8.65% on two anomaly detection datasets
and a failure identification dataset, respectively. We believe these findings
provide insights into semantically understanding log messages for the log

are often difficult to use as they lack the declarative language and
optimization possibilities of relational engines. This paper introduces
RumbleML, a high-level, declarative library integrated into the RumbleDB engine
and with the JSONiq language. RumbleML allows using a single platform for data
cleaning, data preparation, training, and inference, as well as management of
models and results. It does it using a purely declarative language (JSONiq) for
all these tasks and without any performance loss over existing platforms (e.g.
Spark). The key insights of the design of RumbleML are that training sets,
evaluation sets, and test sets can be represented as homogeneous sequences of
flat objects; that models can be seamlessly embodied in function items mapping
input test sets into prediction-augmented result sets; and that estimators can
be seamlessly embodied in function items mapping input training sets to models.
We argue that this makes JSONiq a viable and seamless programming language for
data lakehouses across all their features, whether database-related or
machine-learning-related. While lakehouses bring Machine Learning and Data
Wrangling on the same platform, RumbleML also brings them to the same language,
JSONiq. In the paper, we present the first prototype and compare its
performance to Spark showing the benefit of a huge functionality and
productivity gain for cleaning up, normalizing, validating data, feeding it
into Machine Learning pipelines, and analyzing the output, all within the same

show core growth which is dominated by two cores forming at its respective end.
The end cores form due to a strong increasing acceleration at the filament ends
which leads to a sweep-up of material during the filament collapse along its
axis. As this growth mode is typically faster than any other core formation
mode in a filament, the end cores usually dominate in mass and density compared
to other cores forming inside a filament. However, observations of star-forming
filaments do not show this prevalence of cores at the filament ends. We explore
a possible mechanism to slow the growth of the end cores using numerical
simulations of simultaneous filament and embedded core formation, in our case a
radially accreting filament forming in a finite converging flow. While such a
setup still leads to end cores, they soon begin to move inwards and a density
gradient is formed outside of the cores by the continued accumulation of
material. As a result, the outermost cores are not longer located at the exact
ends of the filament and the density gradient softens the inward gravitational
acceleration of the cores. Therefore, the two end cores do not grow as fast as
expected and thus do not dominate over other core formation modes in the
filament.

reproducible dynamics such as cognitive processes in the brain. We demonstrate
how heteroclinic units can act as pacemakers to entrain larger sets of units
from a resting state to hierarchical heteroclinic motion that is able to
describe fast oscillations modulated by slow oscillations. Such features are
observed in brain dynamics. The entrainment range depends on the type of
coupling, the spatial location of the pacemaker and the individual bifurcation
parameters of the pacemaker and the driven units. Noise as well as a small
back-coupling to the pacemaker facilitate synchronization. Units can be
synchronously entrained to different temporal patterns encoding transiently
excited neural populations, depending on the selected path in the heteroclinic
network. Via entrainment, these temporal patterns, locally generated by the
pacemakers, can be communicated to the resting units in target waves over a
spatial grid. For getting entrained there is no need of fine-tuning the
parameters of the resting units. Thus, entrainment provides one way of
processing information over the grid, when information is encoded in the

envelope traced by HINSA is found to be magnetically supercritical, with a
field strength comparable to that of the surrounding diffuse, magnetically
subcritical CNM despite a large increase in density. The reduction of the
magnetic flux relative to the mass, necessary for star formation, thus seems to
have already happened during the transition from the diffuse CNM to the

difficult to gauge the performance of new models due to the lack of a uniform

regard the task as a code completion problem; while others recommend relative
APIs given natural language queries. To reduce the challenges and better
facilitate future research, in this paper, we revisit the API recommendation
task and aim at benchmarking the approaches. Specifically, the paper groups the
approaches into two categories according to the task definition, i.e.,
query-based API recommendation and code-based API recommendation. We study 11
recently-proposed approaches along with 4 widely-used IDEs. One benchmark named

Based on APIBench, we distill some actionable insights and challenges for API

the performance of recommending APIs, including data source selection,
appropriate query reformulation, low resource setting, and cross-domain

While most existing searches for additional Higgs bosons concentrate on final

future searches for such final states, we develop a simplified model framework
for heavy Higgs boson decays to a massive SM boson as well as one or more
invisible particles. Allowing one kind of BSM mediator in each decay chain, we
classify the possible decay topologies for each final state, taking into
account all different possibilities for the spin of the mediator and the

possible model realization reveals that the distributions corresponding to the
different simplified model topologies are only mildly affected by the different
spin hypotheses, while there is significant sensitivity for distinguishing
between the different decay topologies. As a consequence, we point out that
expressing the results of experimental searches in terms of the proposed
simplified model topologies will allow one to constrain wide classes of
different BSM models. The application of the proposed simplified model
framework is explicitly demonstrated for the example of a mono-Higgs search.
For each of the simplified models that are proposed in this paper we provide

a robust peak detection algorithm based on awKDE and use it to calculate the

constraint is not comprehensively incorporated into deep network structures; 2)
the entire framework has weak interpretability for the specific MAR task;
hence, the role of each network module is difficult to be evaluated. To
alleviate these issues, in the paper, we construct a novel deep unfolding dual

fluctuations can be regarded as a two-by-two random unitary matrix. In this
paper, for what we believe to be the first time, the capacity of the
polarization drift channel under an average power constraint with imperfect
channel knowledge is characterized. An achievable information rate (AIR) is
derived when imperfect channel knowledge is available and is shown to be highly
dependent on the channel estimation technique. It is also shown that a tighter
lower bound can be achieved when a unitary estimation of the channel is
available. However, the conventional estimation algorithms do not guarantee a
unitary channel estimation. Therefore, by considering the unitary constraint of
the channel, a data-aided channel estimator based on the Kabsch algorithm is
proposed, and its performance is numerically evaluated in terms of AIR. Monte
Carlo simulations show that Kabsch outperforms the least-square error
algorithm. In particular, with complex, Gaussian inputs and eight pilot symbols

distribution systems. Animal-infrastructure interactions vary across focal
species and regions, underlining the need to study the animal-outage
relationship in more species and diverse systems. Animal activity has been used
as an indicator of reliability in the electrical grid system and to describe
temporal patterns in AROs. However, these ARO models have been limited by a
lack of available estimates of species activity, instead approximating activity
based on seasonal and weather patterns in animal-related outage records and
characteristics of broad taxonomic groups, e.g., squirrels. We highlight
publicly available resources to fill the ecological data gap that is limiting
joint analyses between ecology and energy sectors. Species distribution models
(SDMs), a common technique to model the distribution of a species across
geographic space and time, paired with data sourced from eBird, a community
science database for bird observations, provided us with species-specific
estimates of activity to model spatio-temporal patterns of AROs. These
flexible, species-specific estimates can allow future animal-indicators of grid
reliability to be investigated in more diverse regions and ecological
communities, providing a better understanding of the variation that exists in
animal-outage relationship. AROs were best modeled by accounting for multiple
outage-prone species activity patterns and their unique relationships with
seasonality and habitat availability. Different species were important for
modeling outages in different landscapes and seasons depending on their
distribution and migration behavior. We recommend that future models of AROs
include species-specific activity data that account for the diverse spectrum of
spatio-temporal activity patterns that outage-prone animals exhibit.

a new type of multimodal adversarial attacks called decoupling attack in MUROAN
that aims to compromise multimodal models by decoupling their fused modalities.
We leverage the decoupling attack of MUROAN to measure several state-of-the-art
multimodal models and find that the multimodal fusion mechanism in all these
models is vulnerable to decoupling attacks. We especially demonstrate that, in
the worst case, the decoupling attack of MUROAN achieves an attack success rate
of 100% by decoupling just 1.16% of the input space. Finally, we show that
traditional adversarial training is insufficient to improve the robustness of
multimodal models with respect to decoupling attacks. We hope our findings
encourage researchers to pursue improving the robustness of multimodal
learning.

a multi-view model for capturing anomalous behaviors from BGP update traffic,
in which Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) method is used to
reduce the noise in the original time-series data, and Graph Attention Network

their lifespan, but remains a challenge owing to the complexity and
interrelation of different aging mechanisms. As a result, aging prediction
often relies on empirical or data-driven approaches, which obtain their
performance from analyzing large datasets. However, these datasets are
expensive to generate and the models are agnostic of the underlying physics and
thus difficult to extrapolate to new conditions. In this article, a physical
model is used to predict capacity fade caused by solid-electrolyte interphase
(SEI) growth in 62 automotive cells, aged with 28 different protocols. Three
protocols parametrize the time, current and temperature dependence of the
model, the state of charge dependence results from the anode's open circuit
voltage curve. The model validation with the remaining 25 protocols shows a
high predictivity with a root-mean squared error of $1.28\%$. A case study with
the so-validated model shows that the operating window, i.e. maximum and
minimum state of charge, has the largest impact on SEI growth, while the
influence of the applied current is almost negligible. Thereby the presented
model is a promising approach to better understand, quantify and predict aging
of lithium-ion batteries.

suggests another scenario: according to it, such oscillations are due to the
superposition of incommensurate harmonics and their spectrum should contain
discrete frequencies. An accurate Fourier analysis of the classical experiment
by Washburn and Webb reveals a practically discrete spectrum in agreement with
the latter scenario. However, this spectrum is close in shape to the discrete
white noise spectrum whose properties are similar to a continuous one. More
detailed analysis reveals the existence of the continuous component, whose
smallness is explained theoretically. A lot of qualitative results are

transformed negatively. The repercussions of unscheduled maintenance are
specifically seen in the increase of man hours required to maintain vehicles
that should have been working well: this can include more man hours spent on
maintenance itself, waiting for parts to arrive, hours spent re-organizing the
repair schedule, and more. The dominant trend in the current maintenance system
at LRSs is that they do not have predictive maintenance infrastructure to
counteract the influx of unscheduled repairs they experience currently, and as
a result, their readiness and performance levels are lower than desired.
  We use data pulled from the Defense Property and Accountability System
(DPAS), that the LRSs currently use to store their vehicle maintenance
information. Using historical vehicle maintenance data we receive from DPAS, we
apply three different algorithms independently to construct an accurate
predictive system to optimize maintenance schedules at any given time. Through
the application of Logistics Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted
Trees algorithms, we found that a Logistic Regression algorithm, fitted to our
data, produced the most accurate results. Our findings indicate that not only
would continuing the use of Logistic Regression be prudent for our research
purposes, but that there is opportunity to further tune and optimize our
Logistic Regression model for higher accuracy.

management, water management associations need means for efficient water
monitoring as well as novel strategies to reduce the pollution of surface and
ground water. Traditionally, water management associations operate large sensor
networks to suffice their needs for hydrological and meteorological measurement
data to monitor and model physical processes within catchments. Implementing a
comprehensive monitoring system often suffers from sparse coverage of in-situ
data. Due to the evolvement of the Copernicus satellite platforms, the broader
availability of satellite data provides a great potential for deriving
complementary information from Earth Observation data. Although the number of
satellite data platforms that provide online processing environments is
growing, it is still a big challenge to integrate those platforms into
traditional workflows of users from environmental domains such as hydrology.
Thus, in this paper, we introduce a software architecture to facilitate the
generation of Earth Observation information targeted towards hydrology. The
presented WaCoDiS System comprises several microservices as well standardized
interfaces that enable a platform-independent processing of satellite data.
First, we discuss the contribution of Earth Observation data to water
monitoring and derive several challenges regarding the facilitation of
satellite data processing. We then describe our system design with a brief
overview about the different system components which form an automated
processing pipeline. The suitability of our system is proven as part of a
pre-operational deployment for a German water management association. In
addition, we demonstrate how our system is capable of integrating satellite
data platforms, using the Copernicus Data and Exploitation Platform -
Deutschland (CODE-DE) as a reference example.

  Unsupervised Learning-Based Clustering","9 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network can serve as an aerial relay to
periodically receive packets from macro base stations (BSs). Severe packet loss
may happen especially when UAVs have bad wireless connections to a BS. In this
paper, a data exchange scheme is proposed utilizing unsupervised learning to
enable efficient lost packet retrieval through reliable wireless transmissions
between UAVs instead of through retransmissions of macro BSs with a longer
delay and higher overhead. With the proposed scheme, all UAVs are assigned to
multiple clusters and a UAV can only request its lost packets to UAVs in the
same cluster. By this way, UAVs in different clusters could carry out their
lost packets retrieval processes simultaneously to expedite data exchange. The
agglomerative hierarchical clustering, a type of unsupervised learning, is used
to conduct clustering, guaranteeing that UAVs clustered together could supply
and supplement each other's lost packets. To further enhance data exchange
efficiency, a data exchange mechanism is designed, where the priority of UAVs
performing data exchange is determined by the number of their lost packets or
the number of requested packets that they can provide. The introduced data
exchange mechanism can make each request-reply process maximally beneficial to
other UAVs' lost packet retrieval in the same cluster. A new random backoff
procedure based on the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance
(CSMA/CA) is designed to support the data exchange mechanism. Finally,
simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our proposed data exchange scheme.

measurement of brain activity because of the large variations between
individuals, signals marred by environmental differences during collection, and
spatiotemporal averaging required by the measurement resolution. In addition,
the data is extremely high dimensional, with the space of the activity
typically having much lower intrinsic dimension. In order to understand the
connection between stimuli of interest and brain activity, and analyze
differences and commonalities between subjects, it becomes important to learn a
meaningful embedding of the data that denoises, and reveals its intrinsic
structure. Specifically, we assume that while noise varies significantly
between individuals, true responses to stimuli will share common,
low-dimensional features between subjects which are jointly discoverable.
Similar approaches have been exploited previously but they have mainly used
linear methods such as PCA and shared response modeling (SRM). In contrast, we
propose a neural network called MRMD-AE (manifold-regularized multiple decoder,
autoencoder), that learns a common embedding from multiple subjects in an
experiment while retaining the ability to decode to individual raw fMRI
signals. We show that our learned common space represents an extensible
manifold (where new points not seen during training can be mapped), improves
the classification accuracy of stimulus features of unseen timepoints, as well
as improves cross-subject translation of fMRI signals. We believe this
framework can be used for many downstream applications such as guided
brain-computer interface (BCI) training in the future.

factor which describes the thermal equilibrium of short-range Hamiltonian
systems, the velocity distribution of which is Maxwellian. It is generically
applicable to systems satisfying the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), among others.
When we focus instead on stationary states of typical complex systems (e.g.,
classical long-range Hamiltonian systems), both the CLT and LDT need to be
generalized. We focus here on a scale-invariant stochastic process involving
strongly-correlated exchangeable random variables which, through the Laplace-de
Finetti theorem, is known to yield a long-tailed $Q$-Gaussian $N\to\infty$
attractor in the space of distributions ($1 < Q<3)$. We present strong
numerical indications that the corresponding LDT probability distribution is
given by $P(N,z)=P_0\,e_q^{-r_q(z)N}=P_0[1-(1-q)r_q(z)N]^{1/(1-q)}$ with
$q=2-1/Q \in (1,5/3)$. The rate function $r_q(z)$ seemingly equals the relative
nonadditive $q_r$-entropy per particle, with $q_r \simeq \frac{7}{10} +
\frac{6}{10}\frac{1}{Q-1}$, thus exhibiting a singularity at $Q=1$ and
recovering the BG value $q_r=1$ in the $Q \to 3$ limit. Let us emphasize that
the extensivity of $r_q(z)N$ appears to be verified, consistently with what is
expected, from the Legendre structure of thermodynamics, for a total entropy.
The present analysis of a relatively simple model somewhat mirroring spin-1/2
long-range-interacting ferromagnets (e.g., with strongly anisotropic XY
coupling) might be helpful for a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium systems
with global correlations and other complex systems.
