physical discovery via automated and high-throughput synthesis, and active
experiments in scattering and electron/probe microscopy. This, in turn,
necessitates the development of active learning methods capable of exploring
relevant parameter spaces with the smallest number of steps. Here we introduce
an active learning approach based on co-navigation of the hypothesis and
experimental spaces. This is realized by combining the structured Gaussian
Processes containing probabilistic models of the possible system's behaviors
(hypotheses) with reinforcement learning policy refinement (discovery). This
approach closely resembles classical human-driven physical discovery, when
several alternative hypotheses realized via models with adjustable parameters
are tested during an experiment. We demonstrate this approach for exploring
concentration-induced phase transitions in combinatorial libraries of Sm-doped
BiFeO3 using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy, but it is straightforward to
extend it to higher-dimensional parameter spaces and more complex physical
problems once the experimental workflow and hypothesis-generation are
available.

work assumes that human behavior remains unchanged when they solve a prediction

is not the case by performing experiments to quantify human-AI interaction in
the context of selective prediction. In particular, we study the impact of
communicating different types of information to humans about the AI system's
decision to defer. Using real-world conservation data and a selective
prediction system that improves expected accuracy over that of the human or AI
system working individually, we show that this messaging has a significant
impact on the accuracy of human judgements. Our results study two components of
the messaging strategy: 1) Whether humans are informed about the prediction of
the AI system and 2) Whether they are informed about the decision of the
selective prediction system to defer. By manipulating these messaging
components, we show that it is possible to significantly boost human
performance by informing the human of the decision to defer, but not revealing
the prediction of the AI. We therefore show that it is vital to consider how
the decision to defer is communicated to a human when designing selective
prediction systems, and that the composite accuracy of a human-AI team must be
carefully evaluated using a human-in-the-loop framework.

and quantum theories on nontrivial momentum space have recently been brought
into explicit correspondence. However, owing to the fact that coordinate
transformations introduce additional position-dependence to the otherwise
solely momentum-dependent metric, there is no fully consistent formulation of
these theories beyond Cartesian coordinates and, in particular, no position
representation. This paper is intended to take the first steps in bridging this
gap by promoting the measure of the Hilbert space scalar product to an operator
and merging it, by analogy with geometric quantization, with the wave
functions. Correspondingly, we find a natural action of the position and
momentum operators on the resulting wave densities in the position
representation, as well as the free particle Hamiltonian and the geodesic
distance. These reduce to their counterparts in deWitt's approach to quantum
mechanics on curved spaces in the corresponding circumstances. We apply the
formalism perturbatively, i.e. in a Riemann normal coordinate-like expansion
with curvature in position and momentum space simultaneously, to the isotropic
harmonic oscillator and the hydrogenic atom. Interestingly, observing the
former it is impossible to distinguish position- from momentum space-curvature.
Thus, we obtain a true instantiation of Born reciprocity on the curved
cotangent bundle, which manifests itself as a symmetry reminiscent of T-duality
in string theory. In particular, the relative corrections induced by the
curvatures in both spaces are dual at low and high energies.

assumption and thereby susceptible to outliers. Although the multivariate $t$
distribution as a robust modeling tool for vector data has a very long history,
its application to matrix data is very limited. The main reason is that the
dimension of the vectorized matrix data is often very high and the higher the
dimension, the lower the breakdown point that measures the robustness. To solve
the robustness problem suffered by FPCA and make it applicable to matrix data,
in this paper we propose a robust extension of FPCA (RFPCA), which is built
upon a $t$-type distribution called matrix-variate $t$ distribution. Like the
multivariate $t$ distribution, the matrix-variate $t$ distribution can
adaptively down-weight outliers and yield robust estimates. We develop a fast

or coupling to ferromagnets -- turned out to have many unwanted side effects,
such as degradation of superconductivity and the formation of sub-gap states,
which is part of the reason Majorana zero modes have been eluding direct
experimental detection for a long time. Here we review several proposal that
rely on controlling the phase of the superconducting order parameter, either as
the sole mechanism for time-reversal-symmetry breaking, or as an additional
handy knob used to reduce the applied magnetic field. These proposals hold
practical promise to improve Majorana formation, and they shed light on the
physics underlying the formation of the topological superconducting state.

temporal resolution based on changes in the visual scene. The properties of
these sensors allow for accurate and fast calculation of optical flow as events
are generated. Existing solutions for calculating optical flow from event data
either fail to capture the true direction of motion due to the aperture
problem, do not use the high temporal resolution of the sensor, or are too
computationally expensive to be run in real time on embedded platforms. In this
research, we first present a faster version of our previous algorithm, ARMS
(Aperture Robust Multi-Scale flow). The new optimized software version (fARMS)
significantly improves throughput on a traditional CPU. Further, we present
hARMS, a hardware realization of the fARMS algorithm allowing for real-time
computation of true flow on low-power, embedded platforms. The proposed hARMS
architecture targets hybrid system-on-chip devices and was designed to maximize
configurability and throughput. The hardware architecture and fARMS algorithm
were developed with asynchronous neuromorphic processing in mind, abandoning
the common use of an event frame and instead operating using only a small
history of relevant events, allowing latency to scale independently of the
sensor resolution. This change in processing paradigm improved the estimation
of flow directions by up to 73% compared to the existing method and yielded a
demonstrated hARMS throughput of up to 1.21 Mevent/s on the benchmark
configuration selected. This throughput enables real-time performance and makes
it the fastest known realization of aperture-robust, event-based optical flow
to date.

of the form $E_i^2=m_i^2+p_i^2+\delta_{i,n} E^{2+n}$ with delta different based
on particle type $i$, with energy $E$, momentum $p$ and rest mass $m$.
Kinematics and energy thresholds of interactions are modified once the LIV
terms become comparable to the squared masses of the particles involved. Thus,
the strongest constraints on the LIV coefficients $\delta_{i,n}$ tend to come
from the highest energies. At sufficiently high energies, photons produced by
cosmic ray interactions as they propagate through the Universe could be
subluminal and unattenuated over cosmological distances. Cosmic ray
interactions can also be modified and lead to detectable fingerprints in the
energy spectrum and mass composition observed on Earth. The data collected at
the Pierre Auger Observatory are therefore possibly sensitive to both the
electromagnetic and hadronic sectors of LIV. In this article, we explore these
two sectors by comparing the energy spectrum and the composition of cosmic rays
and the upper limits on the photon flux from the Pierre Auger Observatory with
simulations including LIV. Constraints on LIV parameters depend strongly on the
mass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies. For the
electromagnetic sector, while no constraints can be obtained in the absence of
protons beyond $10^{19}$ eV, we obtain $\delta_{\gamma,0} > -10^{-21}$,
$\delta_{\gamma,1} > -10^{-40}$ eV$^{-1}$ and $\delta_{\gamma,2} > -10^{-58}$
eV$^{-2}$ in the case of a subdominant proton component up to $10^{20}$ eV. For
the hadronic sector, we study the best description of the data as a function of
LIV coefficients and we derive constraints in the hadronic sector such as
$\delta_{\mathrm{had},0} < 10^{-19}$, $\delta_{\mathrm{had},1} < 10^{-38}$
eV$^{-1}$ and $\delta_{\mathrm{had},2}< 10^{-57}$ eV$^{-2}$ at 5$\sigma$ CL.

The line profile is determined by the evolving thermal state of the gas,
radiation background, Lyman-$\alpha$ radiation from stars scattering off cold
primordial gas and the relative populations of the hyperfine spin levels in
neutral hydrogen atoms. We report a radiometer measurement of the spectrum of
the radio sky in the 55--85~MHz band, which shows that the profile found by
Bowman et al. in data taken with the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of

cosmology, additional mechanisms for cooling the baryons, perhaps via

  Convolutional Network","10 pages, Submitted to IEEE transactions on intelligent
  transportation systems",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Depth estimation is a challenging task of 3D reconstruction to enhance the
accuracy sensing of environment awareness. This work brings a new solution with
a set of improvements, which increase the quantitative and qualitative
understanding of depth maps compared to existing methods. Recently, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated its extraordinary ability
in estimating depth maps from monocular videos. However, traditional CNN does
not support topological structure and they can work only on regular image
regions with determined size and weights. On the other hand, graph
convolutional networks (GCN) can handle the convolution on non-Euclidean data
and it can be applied to irregular image regions within a topological
structure. Therefore, in this work in order to preserve object geometric
appearances and distributions, we aim at exploiting GCN for a self-supervised
depth estimation model. Our model consists of two parallel auto-encoder
networks: the first is an auto-encoder that will depend on ResNet-50 and
extract the feature from the input image and on multi-scale GCN to estimate the
depth map. In turn, the second network will be used to estimate the ego-motion
vector (i.e., 3D pose) between two consecutive frames based on ResNet-18. Both
the estimated 3D pose and depth map will be used for constructing a target
image. A combination of loss functions related to photometric, projection, and
smoothness is used to cope with bad depth prediction and preserve the
discontinuities of the objects. In particular, our method provided comparable
and promising results with a high prediction accuracy of 89% on the publicly
KITTI and Make3D datasets along with a reduction of 40% in the number of

  interaction","Accepted for publication in the Journal of Atmospheric Sciences",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) is a well-tested approach for
specifying the fluxes when the roughness surfaces are homogeneous. For flow
over waves (inhomogeneous surfaces), phase-averaged roughness length scales are
often prescribed through models based on the wave characteristics and the wind
speed. However, such approaches lack generalizability over different wave ages
and steepnesses due to the reliance on model coefficients tuned to specific
datasets. In this paper, a sea surface-based hydrodynamic drag model applicable
to moving surfaces is developed to model the pressure-based surface drag felt
by the wind due to the waves. The model is based on the surface gradient
approach of \citet{Anderson2010} applicable to stationary obstacles and
extended here to the wind-wave problem. The wave drag model proposed specifies
the hydrodynamic force based on the incoming momentum flux, wave phase speed,
and the surface frontal area. The drag coefficient associated with the
wind-wave momentum exchange is determined based on the wave steepness. The wave
drag model is used to simulate turbulent airflow above a monochromatic wave
train with different wave ages and wave steepnesses. The mean velocity profiles
and model form stresses are validated with available lab-scale experimental
data and show good agreement across a wide range of wave steepnesses and wave
ages. The drag force is correlated with the wave surface gradient and
out-of-phase with the wave height distribution by a factor $\pi/2$ for the
sinusoidal wave-train considered. These results demonstrate that the current
approach is sufficiently general over a wide parameter space compared to wave
phase-averaged models with a minimal increase in computational cost.

on a mesonic toy model, showing that our methodology is competitive with the

Our estimates for the ground state mass are in good agreement with the
traditional approach, which is based on the large time exponential behaviour of
the correlation functions. Furthermore, the spectral density also contains
hints of excites states in the spectrum. Spectroscopic analysis of glueball
two-point functions therefore provides a straightforward and insightful
alternative to the traditional method based on the large time exponential

surgery. The long-term stability of these implants is achieved by bone growing
around and into the porous surface of the implant, a process called
osseointegration. However, debonding of the bone-implant interface can still
occur due to aseptic implant loosening and insufficient osseointegration, which
may have dramatic consequences. The aim of this work is to describe a new 3D
finite element frictional contact formulation for the debonding of partially
osseointegrated implants. The contact model is based on a modified Coulomb's
friction law (Immel et al. 2020, Biomech. Model. Mechanobiol.) that takes into
account the tangential debonding of the bone-implant interface. This model is
extended in the direction normal to the bone-implant interface by considering a
cohesive zone model, to account for adhesion phenomena in the normal direction
and for adhesive friction of partially bonded interfaces. The model is applied
to simulate the debonding of an acetabular cup implant. The influence of
partial osseointegration and adhesive effects on the long-term stability of the
implant is assessed. The influence of different patient- and implant-specific
parameters such as the friction coefficient, the trabecular Young's modulus and
the interference fit is also analyzed, in order to determine the optimal
stability for different configurations. Furthermore, this work provides
guidelines for future experimental and computational studies, that are
necessary for further parameter calibration.

two radio pulsars (A and B) that orbit each other with a period of 2.45hr in a
mildly eccentric (e=0.088) binary system, have led to large improvements in the
measurement of relativistic effects in this system. With a 16-yr data span, the
results enable precision tests of theories of gravity for strongly
self-gravitating bodies and also reveal new relativistic effects that have been
expected but are now observed for the first time. These include effects of
light propagation in strong gravitational fields which are currently not
testable by any other method. We observe retardation and aberrational
light-bending that allow determination of the pulsar's spin direction. In
total, we have detected seven post-Keplerian (PK) parameters, more than for any
other binary pulsar. For some of these effects, the measurement precision is so
high that for the first time we have to take higher-order contributions into
account. These include contributions of A's effective mass loss (due to
spin-down) to the observed orbital period decay, a relativistic deformation of
the orbit, and effects of the equation of state of super-dense matter on the
observed PK parameters via relativistic spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the
implications of our findings, including those for the moment of inertia of
neutron stars. We present the currently most precise test of general
relativity's (GR's) quadrupolar description of gravitational waves, validating
GR's prediction at a level of $1.3 \times 10^{-4}$ (95% conf.). We demonstrate
the utility of the Double Pulsar for tests of alternative theories by focusing
on two specific examples and discuss some implications for studies of the
interstellar medium and models for the formation of the Double Pulsar. Finally,
we provide context to other types of related experiments and prospects for the

reaction network (CRN) in such a way that the rank of the network remains
unchanged preserves its capacity for multiple nondegenerate equilibria and/or
periodic orbits. One consequence is that any bounded nondegenerate behaviours
which can occur in a CRN can occur in a CRN with bounded stoichiometric
classes. The main result adds to a family of theorems which tell us which
enlargements of a CRN preserve its capacity for nontrivial dynamical
behaviours. It generalises some earlier claims, and complements similar claims
involving the addition of reactions into CRNs. The result gives us information
on how ignoring some chemical species, as is common in biochemical modelling,
might affect the allowed dynamics in differential equation models of CRNs. We
demonstrate the scope and limitations of the main theorem via several examples.
These illustrate how we can use the main theorem to predict multistationarity
and oscillation in CRNs enlarged with additional species; but also how the
enlargements can introduce new behaviours such as additional periodic orbits
and new bifurcations.

  Survey",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Understanding the effects of social determinants of health on health outcomes
requires data on characteristics of the neighborhoods in which subjects live.
However, estimates of these characteristics are often aggregated over space and
time in a fashion that diminishes their utility. Take, for example, estimates
from the American Community Survey (ACS), a multi-year nationwide survey
administered by the U.S. Census Bureau: estimates for small municipal areas are
aggregated over 5-year periods, whereas 1-year estimates are only available for
municipal areas with populations $>$65,000. Researchers may wish to use ACS
estimates in studies of population health to characterize neighborhood-level
exposures. However, 5-year estimates may not properly characterize temporal
changes or align temporally with other data in the study, while the coarse
spatial resolution of the 1-year estimates diminishes their utility in
characterizing neighborhood exposure. To circumvent this issue, in this paper
we propose a modeling framework to disaggregate estimates of proportions
derived from sampling surveys which explicitly accounts for the survey design
effect. We illustrate the utility of our model by applying it to the ACS data,
generating estimates of poverty for the state of Michigan at fine
spatio-temporal resolution.

filaments joining in a star cluster forming hub, aiming at understanding the
hub structure and to examine the mass fraction residing in the hub and in the
filaments, which is a key factor that influences massive star formation. We
conducted a multi-scale, multi-component analysis of the Herschel column
density maps (resolution of 18.2"" or $\sim$0.07 pc at 830 pc) of the region
using a newly developed algorithm ""getsf"" to identify the structural
components, namely, extended cloud, filaments, and sources. We find that
cascades of lower column density filaments coalesce to form higher density
filaments eventually merging inside the hub (0.8 pc radius). As opposed to the
previous view of the hub as a massive clump with $\sim$1 pc radius, we find it
to be a network of short high-density filaments. The total mass reservoir in
the MonR2 HFS (5 pc $\times$ 5 pc) is split between filaments (54%), extended
cloud (37%) and sources (9%). The M/L of filaments increase from $\sim$ 10
Msun/pc at 1.5pc from the hub to $\sim$ 100 Msun/pc at its centre, while the
number of filaments per annulus of 0.2pc width decreases from 20 to 2 in the
same range. The observed radial column density structure of the HFS (filament
component only) displays a power-law dependence of $N_{\mathrm{H}_2} \propto
r^{-2.17}$ up to a radius of $\sim$2.5 pc from the central hub, resembling a
global collapse of the HFS. We present a scenario where the HFS can be
supported by magnetic fields which interact, merge and reorganize themselves as
the filaments coalesce. In the new view of the hub as a network of high-density
filaments, we suggest that only the stars located in the network can benefit
from the longitudinal flows of gas to become massive, which may explain the
reason for the formation of many low-mass stars in cluster centres.

projects that use these packages as dependencies. When a new vulnerability is
discovered in a package, the package should quickly release a fix in a new
version, referred to as security release in this study. The security release
should be well-documented and require minimal migration effort to facilitate
fast adoption by the client projects. However, to what extent the open source
packages follow these recommendations is not known. The goal of this study is
to aid software practitioners and researchers in understanding the current
practice of releasing security fixes by open source packages and identifying
areas for improvement through an empirical study of security releases.
Specifically, in this paper, we study (1) the time lag between fix and release;
(2) how security fixes are documented in the release notes; (3) code change
characteristics (size and semantic versioning) of the release; and (4) the time
lag between the release and an advisory publication on Snyk or NVD (two popular
vulnerability databases) for security releases over a dataset of 4,377 security
advisories across seven package ecosystems. We find that the median security
release is available in under 4 days of the corresponding fix and contains 134
lines of code (LOC) change. Further, we find that 61.5% of the security
releases come with a release note that documents the corresponding security
fix. However, Snyk and NVD may take a median of 25 days (from the release) to
publish an advisory for these security releases, possibly resulting in delayed
notification to the client projects. Based on our findings, we make four
recommendations for the package maintainers and the ecosystem administrators,
such as using private fork for security fixes and standardizing the practice
for announcing security releases.

motion, cardiac motion, Gibbs ringing, and aliasing. The model can deal with
images acquired in different views, including two, three, and four-chamber
long-axis and short-axis cine CMR images. Two deep learning-based models in
spatial and frequency domains are proposed. Besides recognising these
artefacts, the proposed models are suitable to the common challenges of not
having access to data labels. An unsupervised domain adaptation method and a
Fourier-based convolutional neural network are proposed to overcome these
challenges. We show that the proposed models reliably allow for CMR image
quality assessment. The accuracies obtained for the spatial model in supervised
and weakly supervised learning are 99.41+0.24 and 96.37+0.66 for the UK Biobank
dataset, respectively. Using unsupervised domain adaptation can somewhat
overcome the challenge of not having access to the data labels. The maximum
achieved domain gap coverage in unsupervised domain adaptation is 16.86%.
Domain adaptation can significantly improve a 5-class classification task and
deal with considerable domain shift without data labels. Increasing the speed
of training and testing can be achieved with the proposed model in the
frequency domain. The frequency-domain model can achieve the same accuracy yet
1.548 times faster than the spatial model. This model can also be used directly
on k-space data, and there is no need for image reconstruction.

photonic quantum computing. The main challenge in quantum photonics is how to
generate advanced entangled resource states and efficient light-matter
interfaces. Here we utilize the efficient and coherent coupling of a single
quantum emitter to a nanophotonic waveguide for realizing quantum nonlinear
interaction between single-photon wavepackets. This inherently multimode
quantum system constitutes a new research frontier in quantum optics. We
demonstrate control of a photon with another photon and experimentally unravel
the dynamical response of two-photon interactions mediated by a quantum
emitter, and show that the induced quantum correlations are controlled by the
pulse duration. The work will open new avenues for tailoring complex photonic
quantum resource states.

benchmark three popular adapter-based methods (Adapter, Hyperformer, Compacter)
against the standard full fine-tuning and the recently proposed prompt-tuning

their weights to attain knowledge across tasks. Our results demonstrate that
training the adapter with the weight-sharing technique (4.18% of total

  The notion of maximal order type does not seem to have a direct analogue in

formulas for statures of sums, of products, of the space of words on a space
$X$, of the space of finite multisets on $X$, in particular. They confirm
previously known formulas on wpos, and extend them to Noetherian spaces.
  The proofs are, by necessity, rather different from their wpo counterparts,
and rely on explicit characterizations of the sobrifications of the

relates the physical properties of a galaxy to its spectral energy distribution
(SED). In this paper, we present DSPS: a python package for stellar population
synthesis. All of the functionality in DSPS is implemented natively in the JAX
library for automatic differentiation, and so our predictions for galaxy
photometry are fully differentiable, and directly inherit the performance
benefits of JAX, including portability onto GPUs. DSPS also implements several
novel features, such as i) a flexible empirical model for stellar metallicity
that incorporates correlations with stellar age, and ii) support for the
diffstar model that provides a physically-motivated connection between the star
formation history of a galaxy (SFH) and the mass assembly of its underlying
dark matter halo. We detail a set of theoretical techniques for using autodiff
to calculate gradients of predictions for galaxy SEDs with respect to SPS
parameters that control a range of physical effects, including SFH, stellar
metallicity, nebular emission, and dust attenuation. When forward modeling the
colors of a synthetic galaxy population, we find that DSPS can provide a factor
of 5 speedup over standard SPS codes on a CPU, and a factor of 300-400 on a
modern GPU. When coupled with gradient-based techniques for optimization and
inference, DSPS makes it practical to conduct expansive likelihood analyses of
simulation-based models of the galaxy--halo connection that fully forward model
galaxy spectra and photometry.

this information is often given in the data but discarded because popular
machine learning classifiers cannot incorporate it. We propose a
simulation-based approach that incorporates heteroscedastic measurement error
into existing classification method to better quantify uncertainty in
classification. The proposed method first simulates perturbed realizations of
the data from a Bayesian posterior predictive distribution of a Gaussian
measurement error model. Then, a chosen classifier is fit to each simulation.
The variation across the simulations naturally reflects the uncertainty
propagated from the measurement errors in both labeled and unlabeled data sets.
We demonstrate the use of this approach via two numerical studies. The first is
a thorough simulation study applying the proposed procedure to SVM and RF,
which are well-known hard and soft classifiers, respectively. The second study
is a realistic classification problem of identifying high-$z$ $(2.9 \leq z \leq
5.1)$ quasar candidates from photometric data. The data are from merged
catalogs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the $Spitzer$ IRAC Equatorial Survey,
and the $Spitzer$-HETDEX Exploratory Large-Area Survey. The proposed approach
reveals that out of 11,847 high-$z$ quasar candidates identified by a random
forest without incorporating measurement error, 3,146 are potential
misclassifications with measurement error. Additionally, out of $1.85$ million
objects not identified as high-$z$ quasars without measurement error, 936 can

3HDM, there are contributions to these decays from loops of charged scalars $

from the measurements of $ h\rightarrow \gamma\gamma $ at the LHC. The charged
Higgs bosons $ H^{\pm}_{1,2} $ lead to the enhancement of $ Z\gamma $ decay

those of fermion loops. We also investigate the effects of the model parameters

the 3HDM is dominantly governed by the parameters: two ratios of vacuum
expectation values (VEVs); $ \tan\gamma,~\tan\beta $ and the mixing angles of
the CP-even Higgs bosons, $ \alpha_{1,2}~ \text{and}~\theta $.

exhibit the growing amplitude with the increasing electron density that
contradicts to the expected decrease of wave function overlap for the
rectangular quantum well. To interpret the data obtained, we have used a
self-consistent approach to calculate the electron energy spectrum and the wave
function within framework of the \emph{kP}-model. It has been in particular
shown that the MISO amplitude increase results from the increasing overlap of
the wave functions due to their shift from the gate electrode with the gate
voltage increase known as phenomenon of the negative electron polarizability.
The results obtained from the transport experiments are supported by quantum
capacitance measurements.

polarization (PHIP). During the last decades, numerous methods were proposed
for converting pH2-derived nuclear spin order to the observable magnetization
of pro-tons or other nuclei of interest, usually 13C or 15N. Here, we analyze
the constraints imposed by the topological symmetry of the spin systems on the
amplitude of transferred polarization. In asymmetric systems, heteronuclei can
be polarized to 100%. However, the amplitude drops to 75% in A2BX systems and
further to 50% in A3B2X systems. The latter case is of primary importance for
biological applications of PHIP using sidearm hydrogenation (PHIP-SAH). If the
polarization is transferred to the same type of nuclei, i.e. 1H, symmetry
constraints impose significant boundaries on the spin-order distribution. For
AB, A2B, A3B, A2B2, AA'(AA') systems, the maxi-mum average polarization for
each spin is 100%, 50%, 33.3%, 25%, and 0, respectively, when A and B (or A')
came from pH2 We also discuss the effect of dipole-dipole induced pH2
spin-order distribution in heterogeneous catalysis or nematic liquid crystals.

arise as the hyperspace of nonempty closed sets of a Stone space endowed with
the upper Vietoris topology. In addition to representation, we establish a
choice-free dual equivalence between the category of Boolean algebras with
Boolean homomorphisms and a subcategory of the category of spectral spaces with
spectral maps. We show how this duality can be used to prove some basic facts
about Boolean algebras.

"2112.06860","Peter Humphries","Peter Humphries and Yeongseong Jo","Test Vectors for Archimedean Period Integrals","42 pages",,,,"math.NT math.RT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study period integrals involving Whittaker functions associated to generic
irreducible Casselman-Wallach representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$, where $F$
is an archimedean local field. Via the archimedean theory of newforms for
$\mathrm{GL}_n$ developed by the first author, we prove that newforms are weak
test vectors for several period integrals, including the $\mathrm{GL}_n \times
\mathrm{GL}_n$ Rankin-Selberg integral, the Flicker integral, and the
Bump-Friedberg integral. By taking special values of these period integrals, we
deduce that newforms are weak test vectors for Rankin-Selberg periods,
Flicker-Rallis periods, and Friedberg-Jacquet periods. These results parallel
analogous results in the nonarchimedean setting proven by the second author,
which use the nonarchimedean theory of newforms for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ developed
by Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shalika. By combining these archimedean and
nonarchimedean results, we prove the existence of weak test vectors for certain
global period integrals of automorphic forms.

compact binaries by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors allows us to
perform ever-more sensitive tests of general relativity (GR) in the dynamical
and strong-field regime of gravity. We perform a suite of tests of GR using the
compact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing
run of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals
that have false alarm rates $\leq 10^{-3}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In addition to
signals consistent with binary black hole (BH) mergers, the new events include
GW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star--BH merger. We find
the residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for
each event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all
the post-Newtonian deformation coefficients to be consistent with the
predictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of ~2 in the -1PN
parameter. We also find that the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary
BH constituents are consistent with those of Kerr BHs in GR. We find no
evidence for dispersion of GWs, non-GR modes of polarization, or post-merger
echoes in the events that were analyzed. We update the bound on the mass of the
graviton, at 90% credibility, to $m_g \leq 1.27 \times 10^{-23}
\mathrm{eV}/c^2$. The final mass and final spin as inferred from the pre-merger
and post-merger parts of the waveform are consistent with each other. The
studies of the properties of the remnant BHs, including deviations of the
quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, show consistency with the
predictions of GR. In addition to considering signals individually, we also
combine results from the catalog of GW signals to calculate more precise
population constraints. We find no evidence in support of physics beyond GR.

energy and consequent energization of particles in collisionless plasmas.
Energy transfer in collisionless magnetic reconnection is inherently a two-step
process: reversible, collisionless energization of particles by the electric
field, followed by collisional thermalization of that energy, leading to
irreversible plasma heating. Gyrokinetic numerical simulations are used to
explore the first step of electron energization, and we generate the first
examples of field-particle correlation (FPC) signatures of electron
energization in 2D strong-guide-field collisionless magnetic reconnection. We
determine these velocity space signatures at the x-point and in the exhaust,
the regions of the reconnection geometry in which the electron energization
primarily occurs. Modeling of these velocity-space signatures shows that, in
the strong-guide-field limit, the energization of electrons occurs through bulk
acceleration of the out-of-plane electron flow by parallel electric field that
drives the reconnection, a non-resonant mechanism of energization. We explore
the variation of these velocity-space signatures over the plasma beta range
$0.01 \le \beta_i \le 1$. Our analysis goes beyond the fluid picture of the
plasma dynamics and exploits the kinetic features of electron energization in
the exhaust region to propose a single-point diagnostic which can potentially
identify a reconnection exhaust region using spacecraft observations.

role in several areas of knowledge, from materials science to biology. The lack
of a thermodynamic limit in systems that are intrinsically finite makes the
microcanonical thermostatistics analysis, which is based on the microcanonical
entropy, a suitable alternative to study the aggregation phenomena. Although
microcanonical entropies have been used in the characterization of first-order
phase transitions in many non-additive systems, most of the studies are only
done numerically with aid of advanced Monte Carlo simulations. Here we consider
a semi-analytical approach to characterize aggregation transitions that occur
in a generalized model related to the model introduced by Thirring. By
considering an effective interaction energy between the particles in the
aggregate, our approach allowed us to obtain scaling relations not only for the
microcanonical entropies and temperatures, but also for the sizes of the
aggregates and free-energy profiles. In addition, we test the approach commonly
used in simulations which is based on the conformational microcanonical entropy
determined from a density of states that is a function of the potential energy
only. Besides the evaluation of temperature versus concentration phase
diagrams, we explore this generalized model to illustrate how one can use the
microcanonical thermostatistics as an analysis method to determine
experimentally relevant quantities such as latent heats and free-energy
barriers of aggregation transitions.

for diagnosis and image-guided surgical intervention. However, conventional
approaches to implement 3D US imaging require either expensive and
sophisticated 2D array transducers, or external actuation mechanisms to move a
one-dimensional array mechanically. Here, we propose a 3D US imaging mechanism
using actuated acoustic reflector instead of the sensor elements for volume
acquisition with significantly extended 3D FOV, which can be implemented with
simple hardware and compact size. To improve image quality on the elevation
plane, we introduce an adaptive-delay synthetic aperture focusing (AD-SAF)
method for elevation beamforming. We first evaluated the proposed imaging
mechanism and AD-SAF with simulated point targets and cysts targets. Results of
point targets suggested improved image quality on the elevation plane, and
results of cysts targets demonstrated a potential to improve 3D visualization
of human anatomy. We built a prototype imaging system that has a 3D FOV of 38
mm (lateral) by 38 mm (elevation) by 50 mm (axial) and collected data in
imaging experiments with phantoms. Experimental data showed consistency with
simulation results. The AD-SAF method enhanced quantifying the cyst volume size
in the breast mimicking phantom compared to without elevation beamforming.
These results suggested that the proposed 3D US imaging mechanism could
potentially be applied in clinical scenarios.

cluster-summed colors have received less attention. Since galaxy colors have
given useful insights into dust content and specific star formation rates, this
research investigates possible correlations between cluster-summed colors and
various observable and intrinsic halo properties for clusters in subsamples of
TNG, SDSS, and Buzzard.
  Cluster color--magnitude space shows a peak towards the red and bright
corner, drawn there by bright red galaxies. Summing colors across a cluster
reduces the scatter in color spaces, since magnitude summing acts somewhat like
a weighted average. The correlation between these summed colors were $(73 \pm
24)\%$ across all three datasets. Summed colors and cluster properties
typically had low correlations but ranged up to $\sim 40\%$. The correlation
between color and mass didn't change significantly with richness threshold for
TNG and Buzzard, but for SDSS the correlation decreased dramatically with
increasing richness, passing from positive correlation to negative correlation
near a richness threshold of ten.
  We also looked at mass proxy scaling relations with richness or magnitude and
measured the reduction in mass scatter once we added cluster colors. The
reduction was generally insignificant, but several large reductions in mass
scatter occurred under certain circumstances: high-richness Buzzard
mass--magnitude relation saw a reduction of $(19 \pm 28)\%$ while low-richness
SDSS saw similar order reductions of $(16 \pm 8)\%$ and $(14 \pm 8)\%$ for the
mass--richness and mass--magnitude relations respectively. This first look at
summed cluster color shows potential in aiding mass proxies under certain
circumstances, but more deliberate and thorough investigations are needed to
better characterize and make use of cluster-summed colors.

partial support for that conjecture by showing that some optima of the VAE loss
do satisfy this property, but did not analyze the training dynamics. In this

is the VAE training does recover a generator with support equal to the ground
truth manifold-and does so due to an implicit bias of gradient descent rather
than merely the VAE loss itself. In the nonlinear case, we show that VAE
training frequently learns a higher-dimensional manifold which is a superset of

proposes a configurable micro-rejuvenation technique to counteract software
aging in Android-based mobile devices, acting at a fine-grained level, namely
on in-memory system data structures. The technique is engineered in two phases.
Before releasing the (customized) Android version, a heap profiling facility is
used by the manufacturer's developers to identify potentially bloating data
structures in Android services and to instrument their code. After release, an
aging detection and rejuvenation service will safely clean up the bloating data
structures, with a negligible impact on user perception and device
availability, as neither the device nor operating system's processes are

  categories in hyperbolic geometry","13 Pages",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, an unsupervised and cognitively driven weighted-entropy method
for embedding semantic categories in hyperbolic geometry is proposed. The model
is driven by two fields of research in cognitive linguistics: the first is the
statistical learning theory of language acquisition and the proposal of using
high-dimensional networks to represent semantic knowledge in cognition, and the
second is the domain-specific approach to semantic communication. Weighted
conditional entropy of word co-occurrence is proposed as the embedding metric,
and the two weighting parameters are collocation diversity and conditional
probability ranking in the corresponding statistical distribution. The
Boltzmann distribution is then used on the weighted-entropy metric and embedded
into a hyperbolic Poincare disk model. Testing has been in particular performed
in the domains of basic color and kinship words, which belong to the classes
that domain-specificity focused research in cognitive semantics has most
intensively investigated. Results show that this new approach can successfully
model and map the semantic relationships of popularity and similarity for most
of the basic color and kinship words in English and have potential to be
generalized to other semantic domains and different languages. Generally, this
paper contributes to both computational cognitive semantics and the research on
network and geometry-driven language embedding in computational linguistics and
NLP.

origin of scarred wavefunction revivals in a family of models obtained by
deforming the graph adjacency matrix of the PXP model - the effective model of
Rydberg atoms in the strong Rydberg blockade regime. We consider deformations
that either enhance the Rydberg constraint, ultimately resulting in an
effective tight-binding model of two hypercubes joined at a single vertex, or
relax the constraint until reaching the free spin-1/2 model. In the former
case, we argue that the model of two joined hypercubes captures the essential
features of many-body scarring present in the PXP model. On the other hand,
relaxing the constraint leads to a sequence of new scarred models, some with
more robust scarring signatures than the PXP model, as can be understood from
the graph-theoretic viewpoint. Our results shed light on the nature of scarring
in the PXP model by identifying its simple parent model, while also
highlighting its distinction from the free-spin precession.

methods represent a fundamental change of the admissions process or simply
represent a new tool that achieves the same outcome. To address that, we
developed supervised machine learning models of graduate admissions data
collected from our department over a seven-year period. During the first four
years, our department used a traditional admissions process and switched to a
rubric-based process for the following three years, allowing us to compare
which parts of the applications were used to drive admissions decisions. We
find that faculty focused on applicants' physics GRE scores and grade point
averages when making admissions decisions before the implementation of the
rubric. While we were able to develop a sufficiently good model whose results
we could trust for the data before the implementation of the rubric, we were
unable to do so for the data collected after the implementation of the rubric,
despite multiple modifications to the algorithms and data such as implementing
Tomek Links. Our inability to model the second data set despite being able to
model the first combined with model comparison analyses suggests that
rubric-based admissions does change the underlying process. These results
suggest that rubric-based holistic review is a method that could make the

Solutions based on memristive crossbars and analog data processing promise to
improve the overall energy efficiency. However, memristor nonidealities can
lead to the degradation of neural network accuracy, while the attempts to
mitigate these negative effects often introduce design trade-offs, such as
those between power and reliability. In this work, we design nonideality-aware
training of memristor-based neural networks capable of dealing with the most
common device nonidealities. We demonstrate the feasibility of using
high-resistance devices that exhibit high $I$-$V$ nonlinearity -- by analyzing
experimental data and employing nonideality-aware training, we estimate that
the energy efficiency of memristive vector-matrix multipliers is improved by
three orders of magnitude ($0.715\ \mathrm{TOPs}^{-1}\mathrm{W}^{-1}$ to $381\

that associating the parameters of neural networks with individual memristors

regularization of the corresponding optimization problem, while modifying the
validation procedure leads to more reliable estimates of performance. We
demonstrate the universality and robustness of our approach when dealing with a

  Astronomical Society at 11 Dec 2021",,"10.1093/mnras/stac1672",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nucleosynthesis in classical novae, in particular that of radioactive
isotopes, is directly measurable by its $\gamma$-ray signature. Despite decades
of observations, MeV $\gamma$-rays from novae have never been detected --
neither individually at the time of the explosion, nor as a result of
radioactive decay, nor the diffuse Galactic emission from the nova population.
Thanks to recent developments in modeling of instrumental background for MeV
telescopes such as INTEGRAL/SPI and Fermi/GBM, the prospects to finally detect
these elusive transients are greatly enhanced. This demands for updated and
refined models of $\gamma$-ray spectra and light curves of classical novae. In
this work, we develop numerical models of nova explosions using sub- and
near-Chandrasekhar CO white dwarfs as the progenitor. We study the parameter
dependence of the explosions, their thermodynamics and energetics, as well as
their chemical abundance patterns. We use a Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code
to compute $\gamma$-ray light curves and spectra, with a focus on the early
time evolution. We compare our results to previous studies and find that the
expected 511-keV-line flash at the time of the explosion is heavily suppressed,
showing a maximum flux of only $10^{-9}\,{\rm ph}\,$cm$^{-2}\,$s$^{-1}$ and
thus making it at least one million times fainter than estimated before. This
finding would render it impossible for current MeV instruments to detect novae
within the first day after the outburst. Nevertheless, our time-resolved
spectra can be used for retrospective analyses of archival data, thereby
improving the sensitivity of the instruments.

heat carriers propagate and scatter particle-like as described by Peierls'
formulation of the Boltzmann transport equation for phonon wavepackets. In
glasses, instead, carriers behave wave-like, diffusing via a Zener-like
tunneling between quasi-degenerate vibrational eigenstates, as described by the
Allen-Feldman equation. Recently, it has been shown that these two conduction
mechanisms emerge from a Wigner transport equation, which unifies and extends
the Peierls-Boltzmann and Allen-Feldman formulations, allowing to describe also
complex crystals where particle-like and wave-like conduction mechanisms
coexist. Here, we discuss the theoretical foundations of such transport
equation as is derived from the Wigner phase-space formulation of quantum
mechanics, elucidating how the interplay between disorder, anharmonicity, and
the quantum Bose-Einstein statistics of atomic vibrations determines thermal
conductivity. This Wigner formulation argues for a preferential phase
convention for the dynamical matrix in the reciprocal Bloch representation and
related off-diagonal velocity operator's elements; such convention is the only
one yielding a conductivity which is invariant with respect to the non-unique
choice of the crystal's unit cell and is size-consistent. We rationalize the
conditions determining the crossover from particle-like to wave-like heat
conduction, showing that phonons below the Ioffe-Regel limit (i.e. with a mean
free path shorter than the interatomic spacing) contribute to heat transport
due to their wave-like capability to interfere and tunnel. Finally, we show
that the present approach overcomes the failures of the Peierls-Boltzmann
formulation for materials with ultralow or glass-like thermal conductivity.

$\Pi$ of the plane into regions so that each region contains roughly $\sigma =
n/k$ points. $\Pi$ should satisfy a notion of ''local'' fairness, which is
related to the notion of core, a well-studied concept in cooperative game
theory. A region is associated with the majority party in that region, and a
point is unhappy in $\Pi$ if it belongs to the minority party. A group $D$ of
roughly $\sigma$ contiguous points is called a deviating group with respect to
$\Pi$ if majority of points in $D$ are unhappy in $\Pi$. The partition $\Pi$ is
locally fair if there is no deviating group with respect to $\Pi$.
  This paper focuses on a restricted case when points lie in $1$D. The problem
is non-trivial even in this case. We consider both adversarial and ''beyond
worst-case"" settings for this problem. For the former, we characterize the
input parameters for which a locally fair partition always exists; we also show
that a locally fair partition may not exist for certain parameters. We then
consider input models where there are ''runs'' of red and blue points. For such
clustered inputs, we show that a locally fair partition may not exist for
certain values of $\sigma$, but an approximate locally fair partition exists if
we allow some regions to have smaller sizes. We finally present a
polynomial-time algorithm for computing a locally fair partition if one exists.

method based on principal component analysis. We then perform a Fisher forecast
for the parameters describing the oscillatory signal. For a sharp feature we
distinguish between the contributions to the stochastic gravitational wave
background induced during inflation and in the post-inflationary period, which
peak at different frequencies. We find that for the latter case the amplitude
of the oscillation is expected to be measurable with $< 10\%$ accuracy if the
corresponding peak satisfies $h^2 \Omega_\textrm{GW} \gtrsim
10^{-12}$-$10^{-11}$, while for inflationary-era gravitational waves a
detection of the oscillations requires a higher peak amplitude of $h^2
\Omega_\textrm{GW}$, as the oscillations only appear on the UV tail of the
spectrum. For a resonant feature the detection prospects with LISA are
maximised if the frequency of the oscillation falls into the range
$\omega_\textrm{log} = 4$ to $10$. Our results confirm that oscillations in the
frequency profile of the stochastic gravitational wave background are a
worthwhile target for future detection efforts and offer a key for
experimentally testing inflation at small scales.

We also design a graph-structured network to broadcast multi-level contexts via
light-weighted message-passing layers and generate high-resolution feature maps

a coarse-to-fine framework for accurate correspondence prediction using cycle
consistency. Our feature descriptors capture both local and global information,
thus enabling a continuous feature field for querying arbitrary points at high

bulk-boundary, bulk-dislocation correspondences and topological invariant, of
the parent topological crystals. We exemplify these outcomes by focusing on
two-dimensional parent Chern insulators, leaving its signatures on projected
one-dimensional (1D) topological branes in terms of localized endpoint,
dislocation modes and the local Chern number. Finally, by stacking 1D projected
Chern insulators, we showcase the imprints of three-dimensional Weyl semimetals
in $d=2$, namely the Fermi arc surface states and bulk chiral zeroth Landau
level, responsible for the chiral anomaly. Altogether, the proposed PTBs open a
realistic avenue to harness higher-dimensional ($d>3$) topological phases in
laboratory.

presented identities can be understood as anomaly equations for a momentum
space conformal symmetry. The Ward identities take the form of inhomogeneous
extensions of the partial differential equations defining the Appell
hypergeometric functions. We employ a manifestly conformal tensor reduction in
order to express these inhomogeneities in compact form, which are given by
linear combinations of Basso-Dixon integrals with shifted dimensions and
propagator powers. The Ward identities naturally generalise to a one-parameter
family of D-dimensional integrals representing correlators in the generalised
fishnet theory of Kazakov and Olivucci. When specified to two spacetime
dimensions, the Yangian Ward identities decouple. Using separation of

Legendre functions, which reduce to elliptic K integrals for an isotropic
choice of propagator powers. We comment on differences in the transcendentality

ultra-light particles via the phenomenon of superradiant instability. By
directly affecting the BH mass and spin, superradiance can lead to a time
evolution of the BH shadow, which nonetheless has been argued to be
unobservable through Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) over realistic
observation timescales. We revisit the superradiance-induced BH shadow
evolution including the competing effects of gas accretion and gravitational
wave (GW) emission and, as a first step towards modelling realistic new physics
scenarios which predict the existence of multiple ultra-light species, we study
the system in the presence of two ultra-light bosons, whose combined effect
could help reducing the shadow evolution timescale. We find that accretion and
GW emission play a negligible role in our results (justifying previous
simplified analyses), and that contrary to our intuition the inclusion of an
additional ultra-light boson does not shorten the BH shadow evolution timescale
and hence improve detection prospects. However, we point out an important
subtlety concerning the observationally meaningful definition of the
superradiance-induced BH shadow evolution timescale, which reduces the latter
by about an order of magnitude, opening up the possibility of observing the
superradiance-induced BH shadow evolution with upcoming VLBI arrays, provided
angular resolutions just below the $\mu{\rm as}$ level can be reached. As a
concrete example, we show that the angular size of the shadow of SgrA$^*$ can
change by up to $0.6\,\mu{\rm as}$ over a period as short as $16$ years, which
further strengthens the scientific case for targeting the shadow of SgrA$^*$

although two proposed probes show great promise for this purpose: the 21cm
global signal and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. We formally
confirm the common assumption that these two probes are highly complementary,
with the kSZ being more sensitive to extended ionization histories and the
global signal to rapidly evolving ones. We do so by performing a
Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) transformation, which casts the data in a basis
designed to emphasize the information content of each probe. We find that
reconstructing the ionization history using both probes gives significantly
more precise results than individual constraints, although carefully chosen,
physically motivated priors play a crucial part in obtaining a bias-free
reconstruction. Additionally, in the KL basis, measurements from one probe can
be used to detect the presence of residual systematics in the other, providing
a safeguard against systematics that would go undetected when data from each
probe is analyzed in isolation. Once detected, the modes contaminated by
systematics can be discarded from the data analysis to avoid biases in
reconstruction.

charge carriers in topological bands. In contrast to conventional materials
where charge carriers are electron-like quasiparticles, topological bands allow
for more exotic possibilities where charge is carried by nontrivial topological
textures, such as skyrmions. However, the real space description of skyrmions
is ill-suited to address the limit of small or `baby' skyrmions which consist
of an electron and a few spin flips. Here, we study the formation of the
smallest skyrmions -- spin polarons, formed as bound states of an electron and
a spin flip -- in Chern ferromagnets. We show that, quite generally, there is
an attraction between an electron and a spin flip that is purely topological in
origin and of $p$-wave symmetry, which promotes the formation of spin polarons.
Applying our results to the topological bands of twisted bilayer graphene, we
identify a range of parameters where spin polarons are formed and are lower in
energy than electrons. In particular, spin polarons are found to be
energetically cheaper on doping correlated insulators at integer fillings
towards charge neutrality, consistent with the absence of quantum oscillations
and the rapid onset of flavor polarization (cascade) transition in this regime.
Our study sets the stage for pairing of spin polarons, helping bridge skyrmion
pairing scenarios and momentum space approaches to superconductivity.

galaxies undergoing very strong star formation events, called extreme emission
line galaxies (EELGs). In this work, we exploit the capabilities of the
Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS), a wide field multifilter
survey, with 2000 square degrees observed. We use it to identify EELGs at low
redshift by their [OIII]5007 emission line. We intend to provide with a more
complete, deep, and less biased sample of local EELGs. We select objects with
an excess of flux in the J-PLUS mediumband $J0515$ filter, which covers the
[OIII] line at z$<$0.06. We remove contaminants (stars and higher redshift
systems) using J-PLUS and WISE infrared data, with SDSS spectra as a benchmark.
We perform spectral energy distribution fitting to estimate the properties of
the galaxies: line fluxes, equivalent widths (EWs), masses, etc. We identify
466 EELGs at ${\rm z} < 0.06$ with [OIII] EW over 300 \text{\AA} and $r$-band
mag. below 20, of which 411 were previously unknown. Most show compact
morphologies, low stellar masses ($\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \sim
{8.13}^{+0.61}_{-0.58}$), low dust extinction
($E(B-V)\sim{0.1}^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$), and very young bursts of star formation
(${3.0}^{+2.7}_{-2.0}$ Myr). Our method is up to $\sim$ 20 times more efficient
detecting EELGs per Mpc$^3$ than broadband surveys, and as complete as
magnitude-limited spectroscopic surveys (and reaching fainter objects). The
sample is not directly biased against strong H$\alpha$ emitters, in contrast
with broadband surveys. We demonstrate the capability of J-PLUS to identify,
following a clear selection process, a large sample of previously unknown EELGs
showing unique properties. A fraction of them are likely similar to the first
galaxies in the Universe, but at a much lower redshift, which makes them ideal
targets for follow-up studies.

and nonlinear Landau damping in the Galactic halo. Only in the Galactic halo,
is the streaming speed of CRs close to the Alfv\'{e}n speed. Alfv\'{e}nic
turbulence plays an important role in both suppressing the streaming
instability and regulating the diffusion of streaming CRs via magnetic field
line tangling, with the effective mean free path of streaming CRs in the
observer frame determined by the Alfv\'{e}nic scale in super-Alfv\'{e}nic

orbit-based approach. Unlike the standard perturbative approach, in which
dynamical friction arises from the LBK torque due to pure resonances, this
alternative, complementary view nicely illustrates how a massive perturber
significantly changes the energies and angular momenta of field particles on
near-resonant orbits, with friction arising from an imbalance between particles
that gain energy and those that lose energy. We treat dynamical friction in a
spherical host system as a restricted three-body problem. This treatment is
applicable in the `slow' regime, in which the perturber sinks slowly and the
standard perturbative framework fails due to the onset of non-linearities.
Hence it is especially suited to investigate the origin of core-stalling: the
cessation of dynamical friction in central constant-density cores. We identify
three different families of near-co-rotation-resonant orbits that dominate the
contribution to dynamical friction. Their relative contribution is governed by
the Lagrange points (fixed points in the co-rotating frame). In particular, one
of the three families, which we call Pac-Man orbits because of their appearance
in the co-rotating frame, is unique to cored density distributions. When the
perturber reaches a central core, a bifurcation of the Lagrange points
drastically changes the orbital make-up, with Pac-Man orbits becoming dominant.
In addition, due to relatively small gradients in the distribution function
inside a core, the net torque from these Pac-Man orbits becomes positive
(enhancing), thereby effectuating a dynamical buoyancy. We argue that core
stalling occurs where this buoyancy is balanced by friction.

easily interpret the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) spectra didn't materialize.
The TeV emission is in the Klein-Nishina (KN) regime and the simple Thomson
regime SSC spectrum is modified, complicating the scene. We describe here a
methodology to obtain an analytic approximation to an observed spectrum and
infer the conditions at the emitting region. The methodology is general and can
be used in any such source. As a test case, we apply it to the observations of
GRB 190114C. We find that the procedure of fitting the model parameters using
the analytic SSC spectrum suffers from some generic problems. However, at the
same time, it conveniently gives a useful insight into the conditions that
shape the spectrum. Once we introduce a correction to the standard KN
approximation, the best fit solution is consistent with the one found in
detailed numerical simulations. As in the numerical analysis, we find a family
of solutions that provide a good approximation to the data and satisfy roughly
$B\propto \Gamma^{-3}$ between the magnetic field and the bulk Lorentz factor,
and we provide a tentative explanation why such a family arises.

candidate WC stars during core helium burning, and WO stars afterwards. We
measure metallicity dependance of the total lifetime of our models and the
duration of their evolutionary phases. We propose an analytic estimate of the
wind optical depth to distinguish models of Wolf-Rayet stars from
transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars, and find that the luminosity ranges
at which WN, WC and WO type stars can exist is a strong function of
metallicity. We find that all carbon-rich models produced in our grids have
optically thick winds and match the luminosity distribution of observed

transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars and Wolf-Rayet stars, and derive their
number ratios at different metallicities. We find that as metallicity
increases, the number of transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars decreases and
the number of Wolf-Rayet stars increases. At high metallicities WC and WO type
stars become more common. We apply our population models to nearby galaxies,

become a promising candidate. There is a growing body of work suggesting that
the carbon core detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass WD can be triggered by
the detonation of a helium shell accreted from a companion WD, through either
inward shock convergence near the center or direct edge-lit detonation. This
""double-detonation"" SN Ia can be triggered by a small helium shell and is
therefore well approximated by the detonation of a bare carbon-oxygen white
dwarf (C/O WD). The impacts of uncertainties in experimentally and
theoretically determined nuclear reaction rates on nucleosynthesis in the
detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass WDs have not yet been fully explored. We
investigate the sensitivity of this model to nuclear reaction rate
uncertainties to better constrain the nucleosynthetic yields resulting from

recently computed eccentric corrections up to 2PN order in the gravitational
waveform modes, notably the $(l,|m|)=(2,2),(2,1),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5)$ multipoles.
The waveform model reproduces the zero eccentricity limit with an accuracy
comparable to the underlying quasi-circular model, with the unfaithfulness of
$\lesssim1\%$ against quasi-circular numerical-relativity (NR) simulations.
When compared against 28 public eccentric NR simulations from the Simulating
eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial orbital eccentricities up to
$e\simeq0.3$ and dimensionless spin magnitudes up to $+0.7$, the model provides
unfaithfulness $<1\%$, showing that both the $(2,|2|)$-modes and the
higher-order modes are reliably described without calibration to NR datasets in
the eccentric sector. The waveform model SEOBNRv4EHM is able to qualitatively
reproduce the phenomenology of dynamical captures, and can be extended to
include spin-precession effects. It can be employed for upcoming observing runs
with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and used to re-analyze existing GW catalogs
to infer the eccentricity parameters for binaries with $e\lesssim0.3$ (at 20 Hz
or lower) and spins up to $\lesssim 0.9-0.95$. The latter is a promising region
of the parameter space where some astrophysical formation scenarios of binaries
predict mild eccentricity in the ground-based detectors' bandwidth. Assessing

Lewis metrics of the Weyl class has been obtained, depending only on three

deficit -- corresponding to a coordinate system fixed to the ""distant stars""

with the electromagnetic analogue. We discuss here its generality, main
physical features and important limits (the Levi-Civita static cylinder, and
spinning cosmic strings). We contrast it on geometric and physical grounds with
the Kerr spacetime -- as an example of a metric which is locally non-static.

such as fractional quantum Hall states and spin liquids. Accessing such states
often requires extreme conditions such as low temperatures, high magnetic
fields, pure samples, etc. Another approach would be to engineer the
topological orders in systems with more accessible ingredients. In this work,
we present networks of Majorana bound states, which are currently accessible in
semiconductor nanowires proximitized to conventional superconductors, and show
that the effective low-energy theory is topologically ordered. We first
demonstrate the main principles in a lattice made of Kitaev superconducting
chains comprising both spin species. The lattice is coupled to free magnetic
moments through the Kondo interaction. We then show that at the weak coupling
limit, effective ring spin interactions are induced between magnetic moments
with a topological order enjoying a local $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$
gauge symmetry. We then show that the same topological order and also the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ one can be engineered in architecture patterns of semiconductor
nanowires hosting Majorana bound states. The basic blocks of patterns are the
time-reversal Majorana Cooper boxes coupled to each other by metallic leads,
and the Majorana states are allowed to tunnel to quantum dots sitting on the
vertices of the lattices. In the limit of strong onsite Coulomb interactions,
where the charge fluctuations are suppressed, the magnetic moments of dots on
the square and honeycomb lattices are described by topologically ordered spin
models with underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$
gauge symmetries, respectively. Finally, we show that the latter topological
order can also be realized in a network of purely Majorana zero modes in the
absence of coupling to quantum dots.

many-body Hamiltonians has been recently conjectured to be a diagnostic of
quantum chaos and integrability. In quantum chaotic systems it has been found
to behave as in typical pure states, while in integrable systems it has been
found to behave as in typical pure Gaussian states. In this tutorial, we
provide a pedagogical introduction to known results about the entanglement
entropy of subsystems of typical pure states and of typical pure Gaussian
states. They both exhibit a leading term that scales with the volume of the
subsystem, when smaller than one half of the volume of the system, but the
prefactor of the volume law is fundamentally different. It is constant (and
maximal) for typical pure states, and it depends on the ratio between the
volume of the subsystem and of the entire system for typical pure Gaussian
states. Since particle-number conservation plays an important role in many
physical Hamiltonians, we discuss its effect on typical pure states and on
typical pure Gaussian states. We prove that while the behavior of the leading
volume-law terms does not change qualitatively, the nature of the subleading
terms can change. In particular, subleading corrections can appear that depend
on the square root of the volume of the subsystem. We unveil the origin of
those corrections. Finally, we discuss the connection between the entanglement
entropy of typical pure states and analytical results obtained in the context
of random matrix theory, as well as numerical results obtained for physical
Hamiltonians.

(AGNs) to cosmic hydrogen reionization, by tracing the growth and ionizing
output of the first generation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Our
calculations are anchored to the observed population of z~6 quasars, and trace
back the evolving spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the accretion flows
that power these early AGNs and consider a variety of growth histories,
including super-Eddington accretion. Compared to a fixed-shape SED, the
evolving thin disks can produce ionizing radiation that is higher by up to
~80%. Across a variety of SMBH growth scenarios, the contribution of AGNs to
reionization is limited to late epochs (z<7), and remains sub-dominant compared
to star-forming galaxies. This conclusion holds irrespective of the (still
unknown) space density of low-luminosity z=6 AGNs, and for growth scenarios
that allow super-Eddington accretion. The contribution of AGNs to reionization
can extend to earlier epochs (z>8) in scenarios with relative slow SMBH mass
growth, i.e., for low accretion rates and/or high spins. We finally demonstrate
that our framework can reproduce the observed quasar proximity zone sizes, and
that compact proximity zones around z=6 quasars can be explained by the late
onset of super-Eddington accretion.

larger than what is expected from photometric errors) along with hints of
possible bimodality in the MP sensitive (F343N - F438W, F438W)
color-magnitude-diagram (CMD). Such an effect is observed in all color
combinations including the F343N filter, while it is not found in the optical
CMDs. This observational evidence suggests we might have found light-element
chemical abundance variations along the MS of NGC 1783, which represents the
first detection of MPs in a system younger than 2 Gyr. A comparison with
isochrones including MP-like abundances shows that the observed broadening is
compatible with a N abundance enhancement of Delta([N/Fe]) ~0.3. Our analysis
also confirms previous results about the lack of MPs along the cluster RGB.
However, we find that the apparent disagreement between the results found on
the MS and the RGB is compatible with the mixing effects linked to the first
dredge-up. This study provides new key information about the MP phenomenon and
suggests that star clusters form in a similar way at any cosmic age.

generalization to more than two waves is straight-forward. The order of
interference is defined as the number of paths that interfere in a manner that
cannot be reduced to patterns of a lower order. In practice, second-order
interference means that in, say, a triple-slit experiment, the interference
pattern when all three slits are open can be predicted from the interference
patterns between all possible pairs of slits. Quantum mechanics is often said
to only exhibit second-order interference. However, this is only true under
specific assumptions, typically single-particles undergoing linear evolution.
Here we experimentally show that nonlinear evolution can in fact lead to
higher-order interference. The higher-order interference in our experiment has
a simple quantum mechanical description; namely, optical coherent states
interacting in a nonlinear medium. Our work shows that nonlinear evolution
could open a loophole for experiments attempting to verify Born's rule by
ruling out higher-order interference.

formation. Here, we examine the double-gyroid (DG) network phase of block
copolymer (BCP) melts, a prototypical soft self-assembly system, by using a
geometric formulation of the strong stretching theory (SST) of BCP melts. The
theory establishes the direct link between molecular BCP packing,
thermodynamics of melt assembly and the {\it medial map}, a generic geometric
measure of the center of complex shapes. We show that ""medial packing"" is
essential for thermodynamic stability of DG in strongly-segregated melts,
reconciling a long-standing contradiction between infinite- and
finite-segregation theories, corroborating our SST predictions at
finite-segregation via self-consistent field calculations. Additionally, we
find a previously unrecognized non-monotonic dependence of DG stability on the
elastic asymmetry, the comparative entropic stiffness of matrix-forming to
tubular-network forming blocks. The composition window of stable DG --
intermediate to competitor lamellar and columnar phases -- widens both for
large and small elastic asymmetry, seemingly overturning the heuristic view
that packing frustration is localized to the tubular domains. This study
demonstrates utility of geometric optimization of {\it medial tesselations} for
understanding in soft-molecular assembly. As such, the particular medial-based
approach deployed here is readily generalizable to study packing frustration
far beyond the case of DG morphologies in neat BCP assemblies.

carried over to the generalized definitions without any code change. Second, an
existing mechanized library on $\omega$-cocontinuous functors had to be
extended by constructions and theorems necessary for constructing multi-sorted

be generalized from a monoidal to a bicategorical setting, again to account for
non-endofunctors arising in the typed case. This uses actions of endofunctors
on functors with given source, and the corresponding notion of strong functors
between actions, all formalized in UniMath using a recently developed library

this inconsistency is due to estimating disk fractions at the cores of
clusters, where radiation fields external to a star-disk system can
photoevaporate the disk. To test this, we have observed a field on the western
outskirts of the IC 1396 star-forming region with \textit{XMM-Newton} to
identify new Class III YSO cluster members. Our X-ray sample is complete for
YSOs down to $1.8\,M_{\odot}$. We use a subset of these X-ray sources that have
near- and mid-infrared counterparts to determine the disk fraction for this
field. We find that the fraction of X-ray-detected cluster members that host
disks in the field we observe is $17_{-7}^{+10}\%$ (1$\sigma$), comparable with
the $29_{-3}^{+4}\%$ found in an adjacent field centered on the cometary
globule IC 1396A. We re-evaluate YSO identifications in the IC 1396A field
using \textit{Gaia} parallaxes compared to previous color-cut-only
identifications, finding that incorporating independent distance measurements
provides key additional constraints. Given the existence of at least one
massive star producing an external radiation field in the cluster core, the
lack of statistically significant difference in disk fraction in each observed

from the cluster core.

information in the blur degradation process. Since event cameras can capture
apparent motion with a high temporal resolution, several attempts have explored
the potential of events for guiding deblurring. These methods generally assume
that the exposure time is the same as the reciprocal of the video frame rate.
However, this is not true in real situations, and the exposure time might be
unknown and dynamically varies depending on the video shooting
environment(e.g., illumination condition). In this paper, we address the
event-guided motion deblurring assuming dynamically variable unknown exposure
time of the frame-based camera. To this end, we first derive a new formulation
for event-guided motion deblurring by considering the exposure and readout time

a novel Exposure Time-based Event Selection(ETES) module to selectively use

decompositions of $G$ into Cartesian products of smaller graphs. When $G$ is
isomorphic to a Cartesian graph product, we call the factors of this product a
factorization of $G$. When $G$ is isomorphic to an isometric subgraph of a
Cartesian graph product, we call those factors a pseudofactorization of $G$.
Prior work has shown that an unweighted graph's pseudofactorization can be used
to generate a canonical isometric embedding into a product of the smallest
possible pseudofactors. However, for arbitrary weighted graphs, which represent
a richer variety of metric spaces, methods for finding isometric embeddings or
determining their existence remain elusive, and indeed pseudofactorization and
factorization have not previously been extended to this context. In this work,
we address the problem of finding the factorization and pseudofactorization of
a weighted graph $G$, where $G$ satisfies the property that every edge
constitutes a shortest path between its endpoints. We term such graphs minimal
graphs, noting that every graph can be made minimal by removing edges not
affecting its path metric. We generalize pseudofactorization and factorization
to minimal graphs and develop new proof techniques that extend the previously
proposed algorithms due to Graham and Winkler [Graham and Winkler, '85] and
Feder [Feder, '92] for pseudofactorization and factorization of unweighted
graphs. We show that any $m$-edge, $n$-vertex graph with positive integer edge
weights can be factored in $O(m^2)$ time, plus the time to find all pairs
shortest paths (APSP) distances in a weighted graph, resulting in an overall
running time of $O(m^2+n^2\log\log n)$ time. We also show that a

velocity through a uniform gas with density 10^(-24) and 10^(-23) g cm^(-3).
Our setup is designed to reproduce the encounter of a young cluster with a
reservoir of dense gas, e. g. during its orbital motion in the host galaxy. In
the low-density models, as a result of the cooling AGB ejecta which collect in
the centre, weakly perturbed by the external ram pressure, a compact central
He-rich SG stellar component is formed on a timescale which decreases with
increasing initial cluster mass. Our high-density models are subject to
stronger ram pressure, which prevents the accumulation of the most He-rich AGB
ejecta in the cluster centre. As a result, the SG is more extended and less
He-enhanced than in the low-density models. By combining our results with
previous simulations, we are able to study relevant, cluster-related scaling
relations across a dynamical range of two orders of magnitude in mass (from
10^5 Msun to 10^7 Msun). In agreement with current observationally-based
estimates, we find positive correlations between the SG-to-total number ratio

another graph $H$ is an isometric embedding if the shortest path distance
between any two vertices in $G$ equals the distance between their images in
$H$. Here, we consider isometric embeddings of a weighted graph $G$ into
unweighted Hamming graphs, called Hamming embeddings, when $G$ satisfies the
property that every edge is a shortest path between its endpoints. Using a
Cartesian product decomposition of $G$ called its pseudofactorization, we show
that every Hamming embedding of $G$ may be partitioned into Hamming embeddings
for each irreducible pseudofactor graph of $G$, which we call its canonical
partition. This implies that $G$ permits a Hamming embedding if and only if
each of its irreducible pseudofactors is Hamming embeddable. This result
extends prior work on unweighted graphs that showed that an unweighted graph
permits a Hamming embedding if and only if each irreducible pseudofactor is a
complete graph. When a graph $G$ has nontrivial pseudofactors, determining
whether $G$ has a Hamming embedding can be simplified to checking embeddability
of two or more smaller graphs.

  Progressive Collapsing Foot Deformity",,"Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 2022","10.1002/jor.25380",,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Progressive collapsing foot deformity results from degeneration of the
ligaments and the posterior tibial tendon (PTT). Our understanding of the
relationship between the failures of them remains incomplete. We sought to
improve this understanding through computational modeling of force in these
soft tissues. The impact of PTT and ligament tears on force changes in the
remaining ligaments was investigated using a previously validated finite
element model of the foot. The ability of the PTT to restore foot alignment in
a collapsed foot was evaluated by increasing the PTT force in a foot with
attenuated ligaments and comparing the alignment angles to the intact foot.
Rupture of any one of the ligaments led to overloading the remaining ligaments,
except for the plantar naviculocuneiform, first plantar tarsometatarsal, and
spring ligaments, where removing one led to unloading the other two. The
attenuation of the plantar fascia, long plantar, short plantar, and spring
ligaments significantly overloaded the deltoid and talocalcaneal ligaments.
Isolated PTT rupture had no effect on foot alignment, but did increase the
force in the deltoid and spring ligaments. Increasing the force within the PTT
to 30% of body weight was effective at restoring foot alignment during quiet
stance, primarily through reducing hindfoot valgus and forefoot abduction as
opposed to improving arch height. The attenuation of any one ligament often
leads to overload of the remaining ligaments which may lead to progressive
degeneration. The PTT can maintain alignment in the collapsing foot, but at an
increased load which could lead to its injury. Early intervention, in the form
of ligament repair or reconstruction, might be used to prevent the progression
of deformity. Moreover, strengthening the PTT through therapeutic exercise
might improve its ability to restore foot alignment.

certain aspects of the electronic structure of strongly interacting systems can

random phase approximation to study a two-dimensional Hubbard model with a
unidirectional modulation of the hopping amplitudes as the system evolves from
the uniform square lattice to an array of weakly coupled two-leg ladders. We
find that the pairing correlations retain their dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave

modulated lattice. This enhancement is traced backed to an increase in the
strength of the spin-fluctuation pairing interacting due to favorable Fermi
surface nesting in the modulated system. We then use a random-phase
approximation BCS framework to examine the evolution of the neutron resonance
in the superconducting state. We find that it changes only weakly for moderate
modulations, but breaks up into two distinct resonances at incommensurate
wave-vectors in the limit of weakly coupled ladders.

motion of a magnetic droplet in a uniform rotating magnetic field. The
equations describing the droplet's shape evolution are derived using two
different approaches - a phenomenological equation for the tensor describing
the anisotropy of the droplet, and the hydrodynamic solution using perturbation
theory. We get a system of ordinary differential equations for the parameters
describing the droplet's shape, which we further analyze for the particular
case when the droplet's elongation is in the plane of the rotating field. The
qualitative behavior of this system is governed by a single dimensionless
quantity $\tau\omega$ - the product of the characteristic relaxation time of
small perturbations and the angular frequency of the rotating magnetic field.
Values of $\tau\omega$ determine whether the droplet's equilibrium will be
closer to an oblate or a prolate shape, as well as whether it's shape will
undergo oscillations as it settles to this equilibrium.We show that for small
deformations, the droplet pseudo-rotates in the rotating magnetic field - its
long axis follows the field, which is reminiscent of a rotation, nevertheless
the torque exerted on the surrounding fluid is zero. We compare the analytic
results with a boundary element simulation to determine their accuracy and the
limits of the small deformation theory.

propose a novel Graph-Based Class Selection (GCS) algorithm. In the proposed
approach, a coarse-grained phase selects the most relevant fine-grained
experts. Then, the fine-grained experts encode the intricate details within
each super-class so that the inter-class variation increases. Extensive
experimental evaluations are conducted on various public human action
recognition datasets, including Stanford40, Pascal VOC 2012 Action, BU101+, and
IHAR datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
yields promising improvements. To be more specific, in IHAR, Sanford40, Pascal
VOC 2012 Action, and BU101+ benchmarks, the proposed approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art studies by 8.92%, 0.41%, 0.66%, and 2.11 % with much less
computational cost and without any auxiliary annotation information. Besides,
it is proven that in addressing action recognition with long-tailed
distribution, the proposed method outperforms its counterparts by a significant
margin.

Strong radio waves propagating through the magnetar wind are subject to
non-linear effects, including modulation/filamentation instabilities. We derive
the dispersion relation for modulations of strong waves propagating in
magnetically-dominated pair plasmas focusing on dimensionless strength
parameters $a_0\lesssim 1$, and discuss implications for FRBs. As an effect of
the instability, the FRB radiation intensity develops sheets perpendicular to
the direction of the wind magnetic field. When the FRB front expands outside
the radius where the instability ends, the radiation sheets are scattered due
to diffraction. The FRB scattering timescale depends on the properties of the
magnetar wind. In a cold wind, the typical scattering timescale is $\tau_{\rm
sc}\sim{\rm\; \mu s-ms}$ at the frequency $\nu\sim 1{\rm\; GHz}$. The
scattering timescale increases at low frequencies, with the scaling $\tau_{\rm
sc}\propto\nu^{-2}$. The frequency-dependent broadening of the brightest pulse
of FRB 181112 is consistent with this scaling. From the scattering timescale of
the pulse, one can estimate that the wind Lorentz factor is larger than a few
tens. In a warm wind, the scattering timescale can approach $\tau_{\rm
sc}\sim{\rm\; ns}$. Then scattering produces a frequency modulation of the
observed intensity with a large bandwidth, $\Delta\nu\sim 1/\tau_{\rm
sc}\gtrsim 100{\rm\; MHz}$. Broadband frequency modulations observed in FRBs
could be due to scattering in a warm magnetar wind.

stabilized by a single $Z_4$ symmetry. The model, which was proposed by Y. Cai

five parameters: the two dark matter masses and three dimensionless couplings.
In fact, $S$ interacts with the Standard Model particles via the usual
Higgs-portal, whereas $\psi$ only interacts directly with $S$, via the Yukawa
terms $\overline{\psi^c}(y_s+y_p\gamma^5)\psi\,S$. We consider the two possible
mass hierarchies among the dark matter particles, $M_S<M_\psi$ and
$M_\psi<M_S$, and numerically investigate the consistency of the model with
current bounds. The main novelties of our analysis are the inclusion of the
$y_p$ coupling, the update of the direct detection limits, and a more detailed
characterization of the viable parameter space. For dark matter masses below
$1.3$ TeV or so, we find that the model not only is compatible with all known
constraints, but that it also gives rise to observable signals in future dark
matter experiments. Our results show that both dark matter particles may be
observed in direct detection experiments and that the most relevant indirect
detection channel is due to the annihilation of $\psi$. We also argue that this

correspond to a particular solution to this system, which may have negative
values even if local realism is not violated. A modification of Bell

relationships to the human body: how will a person interact with this object?
Existing data-driven generative models of 3D shapes produce plausible objects

this paper, we learn body-aware generative models of 3D shapes. Specifically,
we train generative models of chairs, an ubiquitous shape category, which can
be conditioned on a given body shape or sitting pose. The
body-shape-conditioned models produce chairs which will be comfortable for a
person with the given body shape; the pose-conditioned models produce chairs
which accommodate the given sitting pose. To train these models, we define a
""sitting pose matching"" metric and a novel ""sitting comfort"" metric.
Calculating these metrics requires an expensive optimization to sit the body
into the chair, which is too slow to be used as a loss function for training a
generative model. Thus, we train neural networks to efficiently approximate
these metrics. We use our approach to train three body-aware generative shape
models: a structured part-based generator, a point cloud generator, and an
implicit surface generator. In all cases, our approach produces models which
adapt their output chair shapes to input human body specifications.

the quiescent level. With a time baseline of 6 years from the first
identification of the counter-part we place stringent limits on the proper
motion of the source, with a measured proper motion of ${\mu} = 3.1\pm1.5$
mas/yr. The direction of proper motion indicates an origin of SGR 1935+2154
very close to the geometric centre of SNR G57.2+08, further strengthening their

tangential space velocity is ${\nu_T} = 97\pm48$ km/s (corrected for
differential Galactic rotation and peculiar Solar motion), although its formal
statistical determination may be compromised owing to few epochs of
observation. The current velocity estimate places it at the low end of the kick
distribution for pulsars, and makes it among the lowest known magnetar kicks.

stream based on data taken with the MEGARA instrument at the 10.4-m Gran
Telescopio Canarias using the integral field spectroscopy mode. Although our
data suggest that this compact object in the stream is actually a foreground
Milky Way halo star, we detect emission lines overlapping a less compact, bluer
and fainter blob of the stream that is clearly visible in both ultra-violet and
optical deep images. From its heliocentric systemic radial velocity derived
from the [OIII] 5007A lines (V_syst= 1548.58+/-1.80 km\s^-1) and new UV and
optical broad-band photometry, we conclude that this over-density could be the
actual core of the stream, with an absolute magnitude of Mg~ -10 and a g-r =
0.08+/- 0.11, consistent with a remnant of a low-mass dwarf satellite
undergoing a current episode of star formation. From the width of the stream,
we calculate that the progenitor mass is between 6.4 x 10^6 Mo -2.7 x 10^7 Mo,
which is typical of a dwarf galaxy. These estimates suggest that this is one of
the lowest mass streams detected so far beyond the Local Group. We find that
blue stellar streams containing star formation regions are commonly predicted
by high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxies lighter than the Milky
Way. This scenario is consistent with the processes explaining the bursty star
formation history of some dwarf satellites, which are followed by a gas
depletion and a fast quenching once they enter within the virial radius of
their host galaxies. Thus, it is likely that the stream's progenitor is
suffering a star-formation burst comparable to those that have shaped the
star-formation history of several Local Group dwarfs in the last few Gigayears.

learning can train optimal walking policies with ease. We apply deep Q-learning
and augmented random search (ARS) to teach a simulated two-dimensional bipedal
robot how to walk using the OpenAI Gym BipedalWalker-v3 environment. Deep
Q-learning did not yield a high reward policy, often prematurely converging to
suboptimal local maxima likely due to the coarsely discretized action space.
ARS, however, resulted in a better trained robot, and produced an optimal
policy which officially ""solves"" the BipedalWalker-v3 problem. Various naive
policies, including a random policy, a manually encoded inch forward policy,
and a stay still policy, were used as benchmarks to evaluate the proficiency of
the learning algorithm results.

First-principle calculation also supports the frequency-independent intrinsic
anomalous Hall conductivity at low frequency. We also find a
thickness-independent Faraday rotation of 59 ($\pm6$) mrad at room temperature,
which comes from the intrinsic Berry curvature contribution. In the thinnest 20

promising results towards the realization of fast, non-volatile memory systems.
Oxidation of the heavy-metal (HM) layer of the SOT-MRAM has been proposed as a
method to increase its energy efficiency. But the results are widely divergent
due to the difficulty in controlling the HM oxidation because of its low
enthalpy of formation. Here, we reconcile these differences by performing a
gradual oxidation procedure, which allows correlating the chemical structure to
the physical properties of the stack. As an HM layer, we chose Pt because of
the strong SOT and the low enthalpy of formation of its oxides. We find
evidence of an oxide inversion layer at the FM/HM interface: the oxygen is
drawn into the FM, while the HM remains metallic near the interface. We further
demonstrate that the oxygen migrates in the volume of the FM layer rather than
being concentrated at the interface. Consequently, we find that the intrinsic
magnitude of the SOT is unchanged compared to the fully metallic structure. The
previously reported apparent increase of SOTs is not intrinsic to platinum
oxide and instead arises from systemic changes produced by oxidation.

been investigated. Here we investigate the heating effect of forced librations
using the model of Van Hoolst et al. (2013), which includes the elasticity of
the ice shell. We find that libration heating in the ice shell is insufficient
to match the inferred conductive heat loss of Enceladus. This suggests that
either Enceladus is not in a thermal steady state, or additional heating
mechanisms beneath the ice shell are contributing the bulk of the power. In the
presence of such an additional heat source, Enceladus resides in a stable
thermal equilibrium, resisting small perturbations to the shell thickness. Our
results do not support the occurrence of a runaway melting process proposed by
Luan and Goldreich (2017). In our study, the strong dependence of conductive
loss on shell thickness stabilizes the thermal state of Enceladus's ice shell.
Our study implies that thermal runaway (if it occurred) or episodic heating on

the performative setting, i.e. when the data distribution reacts to the

a favorable data distribution and performs well on the induced distribution,
thereby minimizing the test loss. Previous work on finding an optimal model
assumes that the data distribution immediately adapts to the deployed model. In
practice, however, this may not be the case, as the population may take time to
adapt to the model. In many applications, the data distribution depends on both
the currently deployed ML model and on the ""state"" that the population was in
before the model was deployed. In this work, we propose a new algorithm,
Stateful Performative Gradient Descent (Stateful PerfGD), for minimizing the
performative loss even in the presence of these effects. We provide theoretical

We calculate the spatial meson correlators and extract the screening masses for

localization. When the LIPSS patterned electrodes are used as substrates to
support Pt-C and RuO2 electrocatalysts, the overpotentials for HER and OER are
decreased by 40 and 25 percent, respectively. Moreover, the capability of the
LIPSS-patterned electrodes to operate at significantly reduced energy is also
demonstrated in a range of electrolytes including alkaline, acidic, neutral,

as the anode and cathode into a cell, it requires 330 mVs of lower electric

$O(k \cdot \operatorname{polylog}(n,\Delta))$ amortized update time. Here, $n$
is an upper bound on the number of active points at any time, and $\Delta$ is
the aspect ratio of the data. Previously, the best known amortized update time
was $O(k^2\cdot \operatorname{polylog}(n,\Delta))$, and is due to Chan,
Gourqin, and Sozio. We demonstrate that the runtime of our algorithm is optimal
up to $\operatorname{polylog}(n,\Delta)$ factors, even for insertion-only
streams, which closes the complexity of fully dynamic $k$-centers clustering.
In particular, we prove that any algorithm for $k$-clustering tasks in
arbitrary metric spaces, including $k$-means, $k$-medians, and $k$-centers,
must make at least $\Omega(n k)$ distance queries to achieve any non-trivial
approximation factor.
  Despite the lower bound for arbitrary metrics, we demonstrate that an update
time sublinear in $k$ is possible for metric spaces which admit locally
sensitive hash functions (LSH). Namely, we demonstrate a black-box
transformation which takes a locally sensitive hash family for a metric space
and produces a faster fully dynamic $k$-centers algorithm for that space. In
particular, for a large class of metrics including Euclidean space, $\ell_p$

  Mungall","A Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM)","Corresponding author: Christopher J. Mungall <cjmungall@lbl.gov>",,,,"cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Despite progress in the development of standards for describing and
exchanging scientific information, the lack of easy-to-use standards for
mapping between different representations of the same or similar objects in
different databases poses a major impediment to data integration and
interoperability. Mappings often lack the metadata needed to be correctly
interpreted and applied. For example, are two terms equivalent or merely
related? Are they narrow or broad matches? Are they associated in some other
way? Such relationships between the mapped terms are often not documented,
leading to incorrect assumptions and making them hard to use in scenarios that
require a high degree of precision (such as diagnostics or risk prediction).
Also, the lack of descriptions of how mappings were done makes it hard to
combine and reconcile mappings, particularly curated and automated ones.
  The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) addresses these
problems by: 1. Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to
describe metadata that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in
mappings explicit. 2. Defining an easy to use table-based format that can be
integrated into existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or
query ontologies, and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data standards. 3.
Implementing open and community-driven collaborative workflows designed to
evolve the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping
practices. 4. Providing reference tools and software libraries for working with
the standard.
  In this paper, we present the SSSOM standard, describe several use cases, and
survey some existing work on standardizing the exchange of mappings, with the
goal of making mappings Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable
(FAIR). The SSSOM specification is at http://w3id.org/sssom/spec.

a conundrum for the claim that eliminative neural models are a radical

the syntax of programming languages is by design determined by phrase structure
grammars, neural models that produce syntactic code are apparently
uninformative about the theoretical foundations of programming languages. The
demonstration that neural models perform well on tasks that involve clearly

that the term language model is misleading and propose the adoption of the
working term corpus model instead, which better reflects the genesis and

whose tangent lines are reflected from the billiard boundary to its tangent

an inner neighborhood foliated by closed caustics, then the billiard is an
ellipse. It was studied by many mathematicians, including H.Poritsky, M.Bialy,
S.Bolotin, A.Mironov, V.Kaloshin, A.Sorrentino and others. In the paper we
study its following generalized dual version stated by S.Tabachnikov. Consider
a closed smooth strictly convex curve $\gamma\subset\mathbb{RP}^2$ equipped
with a dual billiard structure: a family of non-trivial projective involutions
acting on its projective tangent lines and fixing the tangency points. Suppose
that its outer neighborhood admits a foliation by closed curves (including
$\gamma$) such that the involution of each tangent line permutes its
intersection points with every leaf. Then $\gamma$ and the leaves are conics
forming a pencil. We prove positive answer in the case, when the curve $\gamma$
is $C^4$-smooth and the foliation admits a rational first integral. To this
end, we show that each $C^4$-smooth germ $\gamma$ of planar curve carrying a
rationally integrable dual billiard structure is a conic and classify all the
rationally integrable dual billiards on (punctured) conic. They include the
dual billiards induced by pencils of conics, two infinite series of exotic dual
billiards and five more exotic ones.

utility as possible while ensuring sufficient privacy protection on sensitive
data. Such data publication schemes implicitly assume that all data analysts

applicable for the scenario that data users often have different levels of
access to the same data, or different requirements of data utility. The
multi-level privacy requirements for different authorization levels pose new
challenges for private data publication. Traditional PPDP mechanisms only
publish one perturbed and private data copy satisfying some privacy guarantee
to provide relatively accurate analysis results. To find a good tradeoff
between privacy preservation level and data utility itself is a hard problem,
let alone achieving multi-level data utility on this basis. In this paper, we
address this challenge in proposing a novel framework of data publication with
compressive sensing supporting multi-level utility-privacy tradeoffs, which
provides differential privacy. Specifically, we resort to compressive sensing
(CS) method to project a $n$-dimensional vector representation of users' data
to a lower $m$-dimensional space, and then add deliberately designed noise to
satisfy differential privacy. Then, we selectively obfuscate the measurement
vector under compressive sensing by adding linearly encoded noise, and provide
different data reconstruction algorithms for users with different authorization

multi-level of data utility for specific users at different authorization

quality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data
towards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise.
The complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution
itself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current
SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex
denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on
connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped
Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior
performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended
space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered ""velocities"" that are
coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel
score matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn
the score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data,
an easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new
sampling scheme for efficient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We
find that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar
network architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel
sampler for CLD significantly outperforms solvers such as Euler--Maruyama. Our
framework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and
can be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis. Project page and code:

Antenna (ANITA) to possible $\nu_\tau$ point source fluxes detected via
$\tau$-lepton-induced air showers. This investigation is framed around the
observation of four upward-going extensive air shower events very close to the
horizon seen in ANITA-IV. We find that these four upgoing events are not
observationally inconsistent with $\tau$-induced EASs from Earth-skimming
$\nu_\tau$, both in their spectral properties as well as in their observed
locations on the sky. These four events, as well as the overall diffuse and
point source exposure to Earth-skimming $\nu_\tau$, are also compared against
published ultrahigh-energy neutrino limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory.
While none of these four events occurred at sky locations simultaneously
visible by Auger, the implied fluence necessary for ANITA to observe these
events is in strong tension with limits set by Auger across a wide range of
energies and is additionally in tension with ANITA's Askaryan in-ice neutrino
channel above $10^{19}$ eV. We conclude by discussing some of the technical
challenges with simulating and analyzing these near horizon events and the
potential for future observatories to observe similar events.

Updated cross-reference to arXiv:2112.07063",,,,"math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In a companion paper, we introduced raising operator series called
Catalanimals. Among them are Schur Catalanimals, which represent Schur
functions inside copies $\Lambda (X^{m,n})\subset \mathcal{E} $ of the algebra
of symmetric functions embedded in the elliptic Hall algebra $\mathcal{E} $ of
Burban and Schiffmann.
  Here we obtain a combinatorial formula for symmetric functions given by a
class of Catalanimals that includes the Schur Catalanimals. Our formula is
expressed as a weighted sum of LLT polynomials, with terms indexed by
configurations of nested lattice paths called nests, having endpoints and
bounding constraints controlled by data called a den.
  Applied to Schur Catalanimals for the alphabets $X^{m,1}$ with $n=1$, our
`nests in a den' formula proves the combinatorial formula conjectured by Loehr
and Warrington for $\nabla^m s_{\mu }$ as a weighted sum of LLT polynomials
indexed by systems of nested Dyck paths. When $n$ is arbitrary, our formula
establishes an $(m,n)$ version of the Loehr-Warrington conjecture.
  In the case where each nest consists of a single lattice path, the nests in a
den formula reduces to our previous shuffle theorem for paths under any line.
Both this and the $(m,n)$ Loehr-Warrington formula generalize the $(km,kn)$
shuffle theorem proven by Carlsson and Mellit (for $n=1$) and Mellit. Our
formula here unifies these two generalizations.

This integrated copula spectrum retains the advantages of copula-based spectra

on the observation of different extents of broadening of the nuclear quadrupole
resonance spectrum at two crystallographically inequivalent As sites. This AFM
ordering breaks the inversion symmetry of this system, resulting in the
activation of an odd-parity magnetic multipole. Moreover, the onset of
antiferromagnetism $T_{\rm N}$ within an SC phase, with $T_{\rm N} < T_{\rm

training data set, we learn the distribution of camera angles which
significantly improves the performance. Another part of our contribution is to
stabilize training with normalizing flows on high-dimensional 3D pose data by

reducing unwanted interference between QCs caused by crosstalk. We also propose

has Sb-square-net layers and shows charge density wave (CDW) transitions at
ambient pressure. The application of pressure suppresses the CDWs, and above a
pressure of 3.2 GPa, a disordered phase with no CDWs is realized. By utilizing
a mechanical rotator combined with a high-pressure cell, we observed the
angular dependence of the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation up to 3.5 GPa and
confirmed the notable two-dimensional nature of the Fermi surface. In the
disordered phase, we also observed a remarkable field-angular-dependent
magnetoresistance (MR), which exhibited a ""butterfly-like"" polar pattern. To
understand these results, we theoretically calculated the Fermi surface and
conductivity tensor at the disordered phase. We showed that the SdH frequency
and Hall coefficient calculated based on the present Fermi surface model agree
well with the experiment. The transport properties in the disordered phase are
mostly dominated by the anisotropic Dirac band, which has the highest
conductivity owing to linear energy dispersions. We also proposed that
momentum-dependent relaxation time plays an important role in the large
transverse MR and negative longitudinal MR in the disordered phase, which is
experimentally supported by the considerable violation of Kohler's scaling
rule. Although quantitatively complete reproduction was not achieved, the
calculation showed that the elemental features of the butterfly MR could be
reasonably explained as the geometrical effect of the Fermi surface.

ameliorate the ill-posedness of the neural network training problem. By
linearly restricting high-dimensional maps to informed reduced bases of the
inputs, one can compress high-dimensional maps in a constructive way that can
be used to detect appropriate basis ranks, equipped with rigorous error
estimates. A scalable neural network learning framework is thus to learn the
nonlinear compressed reduced basis mapping. Unlike the reduced basis
construction, however, neural network constructions are not guaranteed to
reduce errors by adding representation power, making it difficult to achieve
good practical performance. Inspired by recent approximation theory that
connects ResNets to sequential minimizing flows, we present an adaptive ResNet
construction algorithm. This algorithm allows for depth-wise enrichment of the
neural network approximation, in a manner that can achieve good practical
performance by first training a shallow network and then adapting. We prove
universal approximation of the associated neural network class for $L^2_\nu$
functions on compact sets. Our overall framework allows for constructive means
to detect appropriate breadth and depth, and related compact parametrizations
of neural networks, significantly reducing the need for architectural
hyperparameter tuning. Numerical experiments for parametric PDE problems and a

so that expensive channel estimation at the receiver (AP) can be bypassed. The
receiver at AP needs to carry out active device detection and multi-device data
detection. The active user detection is formulated as the estimation of the
common support of sparse signals, and a message passing based sparse Bayesian

differential modulation, we investigate the problem of non-coherent

heated plasma, as was previously thought. This interface has low temperature,
high density, and low entropy, thus we suggest that the gas is cooling, being
enhanced by the turbulent or tidal 'weather' driven during the early stage of
the merger. Furthermore, our temperature results from the NuSTAR data are in

ways, such as architecture design, attention mechnism, etc. However, almost all
those methods neglect the particularity of class weights (in the classification
layer) in segmentation models. In this paper, we notice that the class weights
of categories that tend to share many adjacent boundary pixels lack
discrimination, thereby limiting the performance. We call this issue
Boundary-caused Class Weights Confusion (BCWC). We try to focus on this problem
and propose a novel method named Embedded Conditional Random Field (E-CRF) to
alleviate it. E-CRF innovatively fuses the CRF into the CNN network as an
organic whole for more effective end-to-end optimization. The reasons are two
folds. It utilizes CRF to guide the message passing between pixels in
high-level features to purify the feature representation of boundary pixels,
with the help of inner pixels belonging to the same object. More importantly,
it enables optimizing class weights from both scale and direction during
backpropagation. We make detailed theoretical analysis to prove it. Besides,
superpixel is integrated into E-CRF and served as an auxiliary to exploit the
local object prior for more reliable message passing. Finally, our proposed
method yields impressive results on ADE20K, Cityscapes, and Pascal Context

provide the optimal memory scheme to accelerate consensus. The contributions of
this paper are three: (i) For the one-tap memory scheme, we demonstrate that
the state deviation memory is useless for the optimal convergence. (ii) In the
worst case, we prove that it is a vain to add any tap of the state deviation
memory, and the one-tap node memory is sufficient to achieve the optimal

on some special networks, such as star networks. Numerical examples are listed

programming for complex mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems with a

described as a strategy of divide and conquer. The Benders' decomposition
algorithm has been employed in a variety of applications such as communication,

In the paper, we propose a hybrid quantum Benders' decomposition algorithm. We
transfer the Benders' decomposition's master problem into the quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and solve it by the
state-of-the-art quantum annealer. Then, we analyze the computational results

takes advantage of both classical and quantum computers, can guarantee the

degenerate. Thus, all the chiral Weyl nodes annihilate with their counterparts

detector and tracker to cooperate to generate a spatio-temporal representation
of the camera and LiDAR data, with which 3D object detection and tracking are
then performed. The detector constructs the spatio-temporal features via the
weighted temporal aggregation of the spatial features obtained by the camera
and LiDAR fusion. Then, the detector reconfigures the initial detection results
using information from the tracklets maintained up to the previous time step.
Based on the spatio-temporal features generated by the detector, the tracker
associates the detected objects with previously tracked objects using a graph
neural network (GNN). We devise a fully-connected GNN facilitated by a
combination of rule-based edge pruning and attention-based edge gating, which
exploits both spatial and temporal object contexts to improve tracking
performance. The experiments conducted on both KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed 3D DetecTrack achieves significant improvements
in both detection and tracking performances over baseline methods and achieves
state-of-the-art performance among existing methods through collaboration

tactile sense of the skin to recognize and manipulate objects, without tactile
sensation, it is very difficult to recognize or skillfully manipulate objects.
In addition, the importance and interest of haptic technology related to touch
are increasing with the development of technologies such as VR and AR in recent
years. So far, the focus is only on haptic technology based on mechanical
devices. Especially, there are not many studies on tactile sensation in the
field of brain-computer interface based on EEG. There have been some studies
that measured the surface roughness of artificial structures in relation to
EEG-based tactile sensation. However, most studies have used passive contact
methods in which the object moves, while the human subject remains still.
Additionally, there have been no EEG-based tactile studies of active skin
touch. In reality, we directly move our hands to feel the sense of touch.
Therefore, as a preliminary study for our future research, we collected EEG

Moving Average(ARMA) filter is used. The effective wave is modeled by using the
6th-order ARMA filter. In addition, the parametric excitation process is
modeled by using a non-memory transformation obtained from the relationship
between GM and wave elevation. The resulting system of equations is represented
by the 8th-order It\^o stochastic differential equation, which consists of a
second-order SDE for the ship motion and a 6th-order SDE for the effective

Furthermore, the probability density function of roll angle is determined by

moir\'e superlattice features extremely flat bands. Due to the enhanced density
of states, the Coulomb interaction induces a variety of instabilities. The most
prominent occur at integer filling and are therefore commonly attributed to
spontaneous polarization of the moir\'e unit cell's `flavor' degrees of freedom
-- spin, valley, and the flat-band degeneracy. As the dominant member of the
hierarchy, these correlated states are thought to crucially determine further
instabilities at lower energy scales, such as superconductivity and weaker
incompressible states at fractional filling. In this work, we examine the
behavior of twisted trilayer graphene in a window of twist angle around
$1.3^{\circ}$, well below the expected magic angle of $1.55^{\circ}$. In this
small twist angle regime, we find surprisingly narrow bands, which are
populated with both an abundance of correlation-driven states at fractional
filling as well as robust superconductivity. The absence of linear-in-$T$
resistivity without significant reduction of the superconducting transition
temperature, provides insights into the origin of both phenomena. Most
remarkably, the hierarchy between integer and fractional filling is absent,
indicating that flavor polarization does not play a governing role. The
prominence of fractional filling in the small twist angle regime also points
towards a longer-range effective Coulomb interaction. Combined, our results
shed new light on outstanding questions in the field, while establishing the
small twist angle regime as a new paradigm for exploring novel flavors of
moir\'e physics.

development of appropriate tools to support community engagement in flood risk

interrogates the potential of citizen science to include disadvantaged urban
communities in project-level flood risk reduction planning processes. This
project collected more than 5000 photos taken by 26 community members living in
13 informal settlements in Fiji and Indonesia between 2018 and 2020. The case
study documents the method used as well as the results achieved within this
2-year project. It discusses the method developed and implemented, outlines the
main results, and provides lessons learned for others embarking on citizen

engagement model and the technology used were key to the success of the
flood-monitoring project. The experiences with the practice of monitoring
floods in collaboration with communities in Fiji and Indonesia provide insights
into how similar projects could advance more participatory risk management

intelligent layered water injection of oilfield, this paper proposes an output
optimal fusion control method based on MPC-PID. Firstly, depending on the well
structure and the flow-pressure characteristics of the layer, the steady-state
model between the differential pressure and flow of the whole well and
different layer sections is established for layered water injection, and the
corresponding wave code amplitude at the steady-state operating point of
different layer sections is solved, the numerical calculation verifies that the
increase of the nozzle opening in a single layer section will drive the
pressure and flow curve of the whole well downward. Secondly, combining the
dynamic response characteristics and steady-state model of the whole-well water
distribution equipment, a dynamic model of layered intelligent water injection
is established, and the generation process of the wave code is defined;
Finally, the MPC-PID optimal fusion control algorithm structure is designed to
derive the fusion control law that minimizes the cost function under fixed
weights, , and the optimal weights are calculated by combining the internal
model structure of controller, so the optimization performance of each
algorithm in the optimal fusion control is balanced. By analyzing the control
simulation results, the fast response characteristics of the fusion control
method are verified. Meanwhile, the simulation comparison experiments of fast
wave code communication under different methods are conducted with the actual
working conditions, the results show that the fusion control method has both
fast tracking control capability and strong robustness, which effectively
enhances the efficiency of wave code communication and shortens the wave code

methods [40,51] which are based on the original form of PDEs, VPVnet uses the
least square functional of the first-order velocity-pressure-vorticity (VPV)
formulation ([30]) as loss functions. As such, only first-order derivative is
required in the loss functions, hence the method is applicable to a much larger
class of problems, e.g. problems with non-smooth solutions. Despite that
several methods have been proposed recently to reduce the regularity
requirement by transforming the original problem into a corresponding
variational form, while for the Stokes' equations, the choice of approximating
spaces for the velocity and the pressure has to satisfy the LBB condition
additionally. Here by making use of the VPV formulation, lower regularity
requirement is achieved with no need for considering the LBB condition.
Convergence and error estimates have been established for the proposed method.
It is worth emphasizing that the VPVnet method is divergence-free and
pressure-robust, while classical inf-sup stable mixed finite elements for the
Stokes' equations are not pressure-robust. Various numerical experiments
including 2D and 3D lid-driven cavity test cases are conducted to demonstrate
its efficiency and accuracy.

explain the dynamical transition by showing analytically, within a simplified

pedestals energy drops below a threshold. This work demonstrates the ability to
control the waveform through the interaction forces, without external
intervention in the light propagation in the laser.

of the gas-liquid phase transitions on soundwave propagation. Since current
methods based on fluid dynamics offer limited information, it is imperative to
carry out further research on this phenomenon. In this study, we investigated
the effects of cavitation and near-critical fluid on soundwaves using the
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Lennard-Jones fluids. In the first-order
liquid-to-gas transition region (far from the critical point), the waveform
does not continuously change with the temperature and source oscillation
amplitude owing to the discontinuous change in the density due to the phase
transition. Meanwhile, in the continuous transition region (crossing near the
critical point), the waveform continuously varies with temperature regardless
of the amplitudes because phase separation is not involved in this region. The
density fluctuations increase as the amplitude increases; however, it does not
affect the waveform. Thus, we clarified that the first-order and continuous
transitions have different impacts on soundwaves. Moreover, we determined the
acoustic characteristics, such as attenuation and nonlinear parameters, by
comparing the results of the numerical solution of Burgers' equation and MD
simulation. Burgers' equation clearly describes the soundwave phenomenon until
phase separation or bubble formation occurs. In the continuous transition
region, the attenuation parameters tend to diverge, reflecting a critical
anomaly trend. We observed the bubbles move forward with the oscillation of
their radii owing to their interaction with the soundwaves. This is the first
direct observation of the interaction using MD simulations.

However, even state-of-the-art fuzzing methods become ineffective after some
period of time, i.e., the coverage hardly improves as existing methods are
ineffective to focus the attention of fuzzing on covering the hard-to-trigger
program paths. In other words, they cannot generate inputs that can break the
bottleneck due to the fundamental difficulty in capturing the complex relations
between the test inputs and program coverage. In particular, existing fuzzers
suffer from the following main limitations: 1) lacking an overall analysis of
the program to identify the most ""rewarding"" seeds, and 2) lacking an effective
mutation strategy which could continuously select and mutates the more relevant
""bytes"" of the seeds.
  In this work, we propose an approach called ATTuzz to address these two

radio telescope. This paper aims to derive a general expression for SEFD of a
polarimetric tripole interferometer. The derivation makes only two basic and
reasonable assumptions. First, the noise under consideration is zero mean and
when expressed in complex phasor domain, has independent and identically
distributed (iid) real and imaginary components. Correlated and non-identically
distributed noise sources are allowed as long as the real and imaginary
components remain iid. Second, the system noise is uncorrelated between the
elements separated by a baseline distance. The SEFD expression is derived from
first principles, that is the standard deviation of the noisy flux estimate in
a target direction due to system noise. The resulting SEFD expression is
expressed as a simple matrix operation that involves a mixture of the system
temperatures of each antenna and the Jones matrix elements. It is not limited
to tripoles, but rather, fully extensible to multipole antennas; it is not
limited to mutually orthogonal antennas. To illustrate the usefulness of the
expression and how the formula is applied, we discuss an example calculation
based on a tripole interferometer on lunar orbit for ultra-long wavelengths
observation. We compared the SEFD results based on a formula assuming short
dipoles and the general expression. As expected, the SEFDs converge at the
ultra-long wavelengths where the dipoles are well-approximated as short
dipoles. The general SEFD expression can be applied to any multipole antenna
systems with arbitrary shapes.

positive aspects of both. We employ a factor model and assume {the dynamic of

dependence. The estimation is articulated in two steps: first, the factors and
their loadings are estimated via principal component analysis and second, the
sparse VAR is estimated by regularized regression on the estimated
idiosyncratic components. We prove the consistency of the proposed estimation
approach as the time and cross-sectional dimension diverge. In the second step,
the estimation error of the first step needs to be accounted for. Here, we do
not follow the naive approach of simply plugging in the standard rates derived

the neuronal competition in the subnetwork responsible for the unconditional

to C$_{24}$ fullerene with a binding energy of -3.4 eV due to a charge transfer
from Y-4d and Y-5s orbitals to the C-2p orbitals of C$_{24}$ fullerene. The
interaction of H$_2$ molecules with the Y atom is due to the Kubas type
interaction involving a charge donation from the metal d orbital to H 1s
orbital, and back donation causing slight elongation of H-H bond length. The
stability of the system at the highest desorption temperature is confirmed by
ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations, and the metal-metal clustering
formation has been investigated by computing the diffusion energy barrier for
the movement of Y atoms. We have corrected all the calculated energies for the
van der Waals (vdW) interactions by applying the dispersion energy corrections,
in addition to the contribution of the GGA exchange-correlation functional. The
C$_{24}$+Y system is stable at room temperature, and at the highest desorption

better in mitigating the pollution effect. In this paper, we present a high

average truncation error of plane waves. Our numerical experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed finite difference scheme with reduced pollution

slower rotators, which could bias measurements of the long-period tail of the
$P_\mathrm{rot}$ distribution. Alternatively, the $P_\mathrm{rot}$ distribution
of stars can be inferred from their projected rotation velocities $v\sin i$ and
radii $R$, without being biased against photometrically quiet stars. We solve
this inference problem using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which (i) is
applicable to heteroscedastic measurements of $v\sin i$ and $R$ with
non-Gaussian uncertainties and (ii) does not require a simple parametric form
for the true $P_\mathrm{rot}$ distribution. We test the method on simulated
data sets and show that the true $P_\mathrm{rot}$ distribution can be recovered
from $\gtrsim 100$ sets of $v\sin i$ and $R$ measured with precisions of
$1\,\mathrm{km/s}$ and $4\%$, respectively, unless the true distribution
includes sharp discontinuities. We apply the method to a sample of 144
late-F/early-G dwarfs in the Kepler field with $v\sin i$ measured from
Keck/HIRES spectra, and find that the typical rotation periods of these stars
are similar to the photometric periods measured from Kepler light curves: we do
not find a large population of slow rotators that are missed in the photometric
sample, although we find evidence that the photometric sample is biased for
young, rapidly-rotating stars. Our results also agree with asteroseismic
measurements of $P_\mathrm{rot}$ for Kepler stars with similar ages and
effective temperatures, and show that $\approx 1.1\,M_\odot$ stars beyond the
middle of their main-sequence lifetimes rotate faster than predicted by
standard magnetic braking laws.

(QCM) biosensor, are seriously affected by nonspecific adsorption of
contaminants involved in analyte solution, and it is exceptionally difficult to
extract the sensor responses caused only by the targets. In this study, we
reveal that this difficulty can be overcome with an ultrahigh-frequency
wireless QCM biosensor. The sensitivity of a QCM biosensor dramatically
improves by thinning the quartz resonator, which also makes the resonance
frequency higher, causing high-speed surface movement. Contaminants weakly
(nonspecifically) interact with the quartz surface, and they fail to follow the
fast surface movement and cannot be detected as the loaded mass. The targets
are, however, tightly captured by the receptor proteins immobilized on the
surface, and they can move with the surface, contributing to the loaded mass
and decreasing the resonant frequency. We develop a MEMS QCM biosensor, in
which an AT-cut quartz resonator of 26 {\mu}m thick is packaged without fixing,
and demonstrate this phenomenon by comparing the frequency changes of
fundamental (about 64 MHz) and ninth (about 576 MHz) modes. At
ultrahigh-frequency operation with the ninth mode, the sensor response is
independent of the amount of impurity proteins, and the binding affinity is
unchanged. We then applied this method for the label-free and sandwich-free
direct detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum, and confirmed its

year-long regular variation with amplitude down to 15 $\rm{m\ s^{-1}}$ for G-

classes A, AI, D, AII and C. The four real classes AI, D, AII and C form a
Klein four-group under the multiplication `$\star$' with class AI the identity,
and class A is the zero element. Our theory leads to novel higher-dimensional
topological physics. (i) The construction can generate large higher-order Chern
numbers, e.g., for some cases the resultant classification is $8\mathbb{Z}$.
(ii) Fascinatingly, the boundary states feature flat nodal hypersurfaces with
nontrivial Chern charges. For the constructed $(d_A+d_B)$D Chern insulator, a
boundary perpendicular to a direction of $\mathcal{H}_A$ generically hosts
$|C_A|$ $d_B$D nodal hypersurfaces, each of which has topological charge $\pm
2C_B$. Under perturbations, each nodal hypersurface bursts into stable unit
nodal points, with the total Chern charge conserved. Examples are given to
demonstrate our theory, which can be experimentally realized in artificial
systems such as acoustic crystals, electric circuit arrays, ultracold atoms, or

processing across multiple nodes, which is a significant burden. In view of the
history of the current Internet, the end-to-end principle was devised for error
management, simplifying the work inside the network and contributing
significantly to the scalability of the Internet. In this paper, we propose to
bring the end-to-end principle into the error management of quantum Internet to
improve the communication resource utilization efficiency of a quantum
Internet. The simulation results show that the error management using the
end-to-end principle and locality can be more resource-efficient than other
settings. In addition, when end-to-end error management is used, if the error
probability of qubits in the end node is sufficiently low, there is no problem
even if the error probability on the network side is higher than that in the
end node, and the load on the network can be reduced. Our proposal will
contribute to improving the communication capacity and scalability of the
quantum Internet, as well as to improve the interoperability of quantum
Autonomous Systems. In addition, existing studies on routing and other aspects
of the quantum Internet may exclude error management from their scope due to
its complexity. The results of this study provide validity to the assumptions
of such studies.

  Compositional Data-Driven Approach","This work has been accepted at IEEE Transactions on Control of

estimation of collision risks for autonomous vehicles (AVs) while acting in a
stochastic multi-agent framework. The proposed approach is based on the
construction of sub-barrier certificates for each stochastic agent via a set of
data collected from its trajectories while providing an a-priori guaranteed
confidence on the data-driven estimation. In our proposed setting, we first
cast the original collision risk problem for each agent as a robust
optimization program (ROP). Solving the acquired ROP is not tractable due to an
unknown model that appears in one of its constraints. To tackle this
difficulty, we collect finite numbers of data from trajectories of each agent
and provide a scenario optimization program (SOP) corresponding to the original
ROP. We then establish a probabilistic bridge between the optimal value of SOP
and that of ROP, and accordingly, we formally construct the sub-barrier
certificate for each unknown agent based on the number of data and a required
level of confidence. We then propose a compositional technique based on
small-gain reasoning to quantify the collision risk for multi-agent AVs with
some desirable confidence based on sub-barrier certificates of individual
agents constructed from data. For the case that the proposed compositionality
conditions are not satisfied, we provide a relaxed version of compositional
results without requiring any compositionality conditions but at the cost of
providing a potentially conservative collision risk. Eventually, we also
present our approaches for non-stochastic multi-agent AVs. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed results by applying them to a vehicle platooning
consisting of 100 vehicles with 1 leader and 99 followers. We formally estimate
the collision risk by collecting data from trajectories of each agent.

(NALs) of $\rm Mg^+$ ions with inflowing speeds of 1071 -- 1979 km/s, which are
likely along the directions close to the axes of accretion disks. The quasars
showing inflowing Mg II NALs have on average slightly smaller Eddington ratios
when compared to the sources with outflow Mg II NALs. The upper limits of
locations of the detected NALs are at parsec scale, around the distances of
dusty tori to central SMBHs. The one possible origin of these infalling NALs is
from dusty tori. Of course, these infalling NALs can also be naturally
explained by chaotic cold accretion resulted from the nonlinear interaction of
active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets with the interstellar medium, and these cold
gaseous blobs may originally precipitate in metal-rich trailing outflows
uplifted by AGN jet ejecta. The infalling NALs may thus provide direct evidence
for cold gas precipitation and accretion in AGN feedback processes, and provide
the direct evidence of inflowing gas along the directions close to quasar jets

tasks and have obtained very appealing performance. However, most GNN-based
recommendation methods suffer from the problem of data sparsity in practice.
Meanwhile, pre-training techniques have achieved great success in mitigating
data sparsity in various domains such as natural language processing (NLP) and
computer vision (CV). Thus, graph pre-training has the great potential to
alleviate data sparsity in GNN-based recommendations. However, pre-training
GNNs for recommendations face unique challenges. For example, user-item

users and items, and they often present different properties. Therefore, the
successful mechanisms commonly used in NLP and CV to transfer knowledge from
pre-training tasks to downstream tasks such as sharing learned embeddings or

recommendations models. To tackle these challenges, we delicately design an
adaptive graph pre-training framework for localized collaborative filtering

capture both the common knowledge across different graphs and the uniqueness
for each graph. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the
effectiveness and superiority of ADAPT.

for the lower back and abdominal musculature, through a novel dry electrodes
belt, multi-channel high density EMG circuitry and problem-specific signal
processing. The subject can easily strap the dry electrodes belt around himself
which provides 16 EMG channels. Interferences from the ECG and motion artefacts
are reduced by a stationary wavelet decomposition. Afterwards, an inter-channel
filter is applied to increase the robustness of the signals. Subject
measurements during different kinds of typical abdominal and lower back
training exercises were performed wearing the novel dry electrodes belt. The
results show the possibility of robust EMG measurements from the lower back and
abdominal muscles by utilizing the gathered redundancy, appropriately. The
additional information obtained via the multi-channel EMG circuitry and spatial
oversampling can be used to address current problems of EMG applications. It
combines the advantages of robustness and the capability of using comfortable

Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks under the pre-training and fine-tuning

and resource-hungry. Hence, model pruning has been introduced to compress
large-scale PLMs. However, most prior approaches only consider task-specific
knowledge towards downstream tasks, but ignore the essential task-agnostic
knowledge during pruning, which may cause catastrophic forgetting problem and
lead to poor generalization ability. To maintain both task-agnostic and
task-specific knowledge in our pruned model, we propose ContrAstive Pruning
(CAP) under the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning. It is designed as a
general framework, compatible with both structured and unstructured pruning.
Unified in contrastive learning, CAP enables the pruned model to learn from the
pre-trained model for task-agnostic knowledge, and fine-tuned model for
task-specific knowledge. Besides, to better retain the performance of the
pruned model, the snapshots (i.e., the intermediate models at each pruning
iteration) also serve as effective supervisions for pruning. Our extensive
experiments show that adopting CAP consistently yields significant
improvements, especially in extremely high sparsity scenarios. With only 3%
model parameters reserved (i.e., 97% sparsity), CAP successfully achieves 99.2%

our probing experiments demonstrate that the model pruned by CAP tends to

radiation of anti-QNs with the use of the Mie theory and found its ratio to the
black-body radiation. This allows us to find the equilibrium temperature of
anti-QNs in the interstellar medium and determine their contribution to the
observed diffuse background radiation in our galaxy in different frequency
intervals, from radio to UV. We also consider non-thermal radiations from
anti-QNs which are produced by products of annihilations of particles of the
interstellar gas with anti-QNs. Such radiations include photons from decays of
$\pi^0$ mesons, synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and transition radiations from
$\pi^\pm$ mesons, electrons and positrons. Synchrotron radiation in MHz
frequency range and flux of photons from $\pi^0$ decays may be above the
detection threshold in such detectors as Fermi-LAT.

on various dark matter halo and galaxy features. The RF is trained and tested
using 2,710 galaxies with stellar mass $\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot>10.16$ from the
TNG100 simulation. Galaxy size is the most important individual feature when
calculated in 3-dimensions, which becomes less important after accounting for
observational effects. For smaller galaxies, the rankings for features related
to merger histories increase. When an entire set of halo and galaxy features
are used, the prediction is almost unbiased, with root-mean-square error (RMSE)
of $\sim$0.068. A combination of up to three features with different types
(galaxy size, merger history and morphology) already saturates the power of
prediction. If using observable features, the RMSE increases to $\sim$0.104,
and a combined usage of stellar mass, galaxy size plus galaxy concentration
achieves similar predictions. Lastly, when using galaxy density, velocity and
velocity dispersion profiles as features, which approximately represent the
maximum amount of information extracted from galaxy images and velocity maps,
the prediction is not improved much. Hence the limiting precision of predicting
$f_\mathrm{acc}$ is $\sim$0.1 with observables, and the multi-component
decomposition of galaxy images should have similar or larger uncertainties. If
the central black hole mass and the spin parameter of galaxies can be
accurately measured in future observations, the RMSE is promising to be further
decreased by $\sim$20%.

of reheating on the predictions of natural inflation. In the presence of
derivative self-interaction of a scalar field and its kinetic coupling to the
Einstein tensor, the gravitational friction to inflaton dynamics is enhanced.
As a result, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is suppressed. We place the
observational constraints on a natural inflation model and show that the model
is now consistent with the observational data for some plausible range of the
model parameter $\Delta$, mainly due to the suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio.
To be consistent with the data at the $1\sigma$ ($68\%$ confidence) level, a
slightly longer $N_k\gtrsim60$ duration of inflation than usually assumed is
preferred. Since the duration of inflation, for any specific inflaton
potential, is related to reheating parameters, including the duration $N_{re}$,
temperature $T_{re}$, and equation-of-state $\omega_{re}$ parameter during
reheating, we imposed the effects of reheating to the inflationary predictions
to put further constraints. The results show that the duration of inflation
$N_k$ is affected by considerations of reheating, mainly by the $\omega_{re}$
and $T_{re}$ parameters. If reheating occurs instantaneously for which
$N_{re}=0$ and $\omega_{re}=1/3$, the duration of inflation is estimated to be
$N_k\simeq57$, where the exact value is less sensitive to the model parameter
$\Delta$ compatible with the CMB data. The duration of inflation is longer (or
shorter) than $N_k\simeq57$ for the equation of state larger (or smaller) than
1/3 hence $N_{re}\neq0$. The maximum temperature at the end of reheating is
$T_{re}^\text{max}\simeq3\times 10^{15}$ GeV, which corresponds to the
instantaneous reheating. The low reheating temperature, as low as a few MeV, is
also possible when $\omega_{re}$ is closer to $1/3$.

how to take into account those multiple modalities simultaneously to boost the
retrieval performance is crucial. This problem is a huge challenge to us due to
the following reasons: (1) the way of extracting patch features with the
pre-trained image model (e.g., CNN-based model) has much inductive bias. It is
difficult to capture the efficient information from the product image in
E-commerce. (2) The heterogeneity of multimodal data makes it challenging to
construct the representations of query text and product including title and

leverages the patch features and pixel features as image representation. Thus
the Transformer architecture can be applied directly to the raw image
sequences. With the pre-trained enhanced BERT as the backbone network, ACE-BERT
further adopts adversarial learning by adding a domain classifier to ensure the
distribution consistency of different modality representations for the purpose
of narrowing down the representation gap between query and product.
Experimental results demonstrate that ACE-BERT outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches on the retrieval task. It is remarkable that ACE-BERT has already

real-world long-context tasks. Our findings reveal pitfalls of an existing

polynomial time $O(1)$-approximation algorithms. Thus, it is a natural question
whether we can maintain $O(1)$-approximate solutions for them in subpolynomial
update time, against adaptive and oblivious adversaries. Only a few results are
known that give partial answers to this question. There are dynamic algorithms
for $k$-center, $k$-means, and $k$-median that maintain constant factor
approximations in expected $\tilde{O}(k^{2})$ update time against an oblivious
adversary. However, for these problems there are no algorithms known with an
update time that is subpolynomial in $k$, and against an adaptive adversary

for-hire human drivers, and the platform on a ride-sourcing network. We
consider a ride-sourcing market where a mixture of AVs and human drivers is
deployed by the platform to provide mobility-on-demand services under labor
regulations. In this market, the ride-sourcing platform determines the spatial
prices, fleet size, human driver payments, and vehicle relocation strategies to
maximize its profit, while individual passengers choose between different
transport modes to minimize their travel costs. A market equilibrium model is
proposed to capture the interactions among passengers, human drivers, AVs, and
the ride-sourcing platform over the network. The overall problem is formulated
as a non-convex program with network constraints, and an algorithm is developed
to derive its approximate solution with performance guarantee. Our study shows
that ride-sourcing platform prioritizes AV deployment in high-demand areas to
make a higher profit. As AVs flood into these high-demand areas, they compete
with human drivers in the urban core and push them to relocate to suburbs. This
leads to reduced earning opportunities for human drivers and increased spatial
inequity for passengers. We also show that placing a wage floor may protect
drivers from the negative impact of AVs, and meanwhile the total vehicle supply
and passenger demand are almost unaffected. However, there exists a threshold
beyond which the minimum wage will trigger a paradigm shift of labor supply
where the platform will completely replace all human drivers with AVs. This
indicates that the minimum wage should be carefully designed in the mixed
environment to avoid the loss of job opportunities for human drivers. These
results are validated with realistic case studies for San Francisco.

of huge embedding model training. We embrace skewed popularity distributions of
embeddings as a performance opportunity and leverage it to address the
communication bottleneck with an embedding cache. To ensure consistency across
the caches, we incorporate a new consistency model into HET design, which
provides fine-grained consistency guarantees on a per-embedding basis. Compared
to previous work that only allows staleness for read operations, HET also
utilizes staleness for write operations. Evaluations on six representative
tasks show that HET achieves up to 88% embedding communication reductions and
up to 20.68x performance speedup over the state-of-the-art baselines.

multi-agent framework needs to handle various scenarios of agents, in terms of
both scales and dynamics, for being practical to real-world applications. We
formulate the multi-agent environment with a different number of agents as a
multi-tasking problem and propose a meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL)

Communication Pattern Recognition (CPR) module to identify communication
behavior and extract information that facilitates the training process.
Experimental results are poised to demonstrate that the proposed framework (a)

training samples. However, the insufficiency of training data may cause a
biased estimation of feature distribution in a certain class. To alleviate this
problem, we present a simple yet effective feature rectification method by
exploring the category correlation between novel and base classes as the prior
knowledge. We explicitly capture such correlation by mapping features into a
latent vector with dimension matching the number of base classes, treating it
as the logarithm probability of the feature over base classes. Based on this
latent vector, the rectified feature is directly constructed by a decoder,
which we expect maintaining category-related information while removing other
stochastic factors, and consequently being closer to its class centroid.
Furthermore, by changing the temperature value in softmax, we can re-balance
the feature rectification and reconstruction for better performance. Our method
is generic, flexible and agnostic to any feature extractor and classifier,
readily to be embedded into existing FSL approaches. Experiments verify that
our method is capable of rectifying biased features, especially when the
feature is far from the class centroid. The proposed approach consistently
obtains considerable performance gains on three widely used benchmarks,
evaluated with different backbones and classifiers.

interest. 1) At high bulk Lorentz factor, large radius and low luminosity,
proton synchrotron emission dominates and produces a spectrum in agreement with
observations. For part of this parameter space, a subdominant (in the MeV band)
power-law is created by the synchrotron emission of the BeHe pairs. This

natural expectation in a proton synchrotron model, and it is seen in some GRBs,

convergence of a Newton-type method. A dedicated structure-exploiting algorithm
(Riccati recursion) is proposed to perform a Newton-type method for the NLP
efficiently because its sparsity structure is different from a standard OCP.
The proposed method computes each Newton step with linear time-complexity for
the total number of discretization grids as the standard Riccati recursion
algorithm. Additionally, the computation is always successful if the solution
is sufficiently close to a local minimum. Conversely, general quadratic
programming (QP) solvers cannot accomplish this because the Hessian matrix is
inherently indefinite. Moreover, a modification on the reduced Hessian matrix
is proposed using the nature of the Riccati recursion algorithm as the dynamic
programming for a QP subproblem to enhance the convergence. A numerical
comparison is conducted with off-the-shelf NLP solvers, which demonstrates that
the proposed method is up to two orders of magnitude faster. Whole-body optimal
control of quadrupedal gaits is also demonstrated and shows that the proposed
method can achieve the whole-body model predictive control (MPC) of robotic

dynamical systems with constraints. However, solving MPC iteratively in real
time, i.e., implicit MPC, remains a computational challenge. To address this,
common solutions include explicit MPC and function approximation. Both methods,
whenever applicable, may improve the computational efficiency of the implicit
MPC by several orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, explicit MPC often requires
expensive pre-computation and does not easily apply to higher-dimensional
problems. Meanwhile, function approximation, although scales better with
dimension, still requires pre-training on a large dataset and generally cannot
guarantee to find an accurate surrogate policy, the failure of which often
leads to closed-loop instability. To address these issues, we propose a
triple-mode hybrid control scheme, named Memory-Augmented MPC, by combining a
linear quadratic regulator, a neural network, and an MPC. From its standard
form, we further derive two variants of such hybrid control scheme: one
customized for chaotic systems and the other for slow systems. The proposed
scheme does not require pre-computation and can improve the amortized running
time of the composed MPC with a well-trained neural network. In addition, the
scheme maintains closed-loop stability with any neural networks of proper input
and output dimensions, alleviating the need for certifying optimality of the

this bias on 2 datasets (from different hospitals) and 2 disease areas as well

exploiting the sparsity structure of IRSA transmissions, when non-orthogonal

Allowing for the use of non-orthogonal pilots is important, as the length of
orthogonal pilots scales linearly with the total number of devices, leading to
prohibitive overhead as the number of devices increases. Next, we present a
novel analysis of the throughput of IRSA under practical channel estimation
errors, with the use of multiple antennas at the BS. Finally, we theoretically
characterize the asymptotic throughput performance of IRSA using a density

accounting for channel estimation errors in analyzing IRSA, which can even lead
to 70% loss in performance in severely interference-limited regimes. We also
provide novel insights on the effect of parameters such as pilot length, SNR,

  Edge",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In edge inference, an edge server provides remote-inference services to edge
devices. This requires the edge devices to upload high-dimensional features of
data samples over resource-constrained wireless channels, which creates a
communication bottleneck. The conventional solution of feature pruning requires
that the device has access to the inference model, which is unavailable in the
current scenario of split inference. To address this issue, we propose the
progressive feature transmission (ProgressFTX) protocol, which minimizes the
overhead by progressively transmitting features until a target confidence level
is reached. The optimal control policy of the protocol to accelerate inference
is derived and it comprises two key operations. The first is importance-aware
feature selection at the server, for which it is shown to be optimal to select
the most important features, characterized by the largest discriminant gains of
the corresponding feature dimensions. The second is transmission-termination
control by the server for which the optimal policy is shown to exhibit a
threshold structure. Specifically, the transmission is stopped when the
incremental uncertainty reduction by further feature transmission is outweighed
by its communication cost. The indices of the selected features and
transmission decision are fed back to the device in each slot. The optimal
policy is first derived for the tractable case of linear classification and
then extended to the more complex case of classification using a convolutional
neural network. Both Gaussian and fading channels are considered. Experimental
results are obtained for both a statistical data model and a real dataset. It
is seen that ProgressFTX can substantially reduce the communication latency
compared to conventional feature pruning and random feature transmission.

col}(y_1,\ldots,y_n),\quad x\in[0,\ell],$$ on a finite interval $[0,\ell]$.
Here $Q$ is a summable potential $n\times n$ matrix function and $B$ is an
invertible self-adjoint diagonal bounded matrix function. If $n=2m$ and
$B(x)={\rm diag}(-I_m,I_m)$, this equation is equivalent to Dirac equation of
order $n$.
  We show the existence of triangular transformation operators for such
equation under additional uniform separation conditions on the entries of the
matrix function $B$. Here we apply this result to study direct spectral
properties of the boundary value problem (BVP) associated with the above
equation subject to the general boundary conditions $U(y)=Cy(0)+Dy(\ell)=0,{\rm
rank}(C\ D)=n$.
  We apply this result to show that the deviation of the characteristic
determinants of this BVP and the unperturbed BVP (with $Q=0$) is a Fourier
transform of some summable function, which in turn yields asymptotic behavior
of the spectrum in the case of regular boundary conditions. Namely,
$\lambda_m=\lambda_m^0+o(1)$ as $m\to\infty$, where
$\{\lambda_m\}_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}$ and $\{\lambda_m^0\}_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}$ are
sequences of eigenvalues of perturbed and unperturbed ($Q=0$) BVP,
respectively.
  Further, we prove that the system of root vectors of the above BVP
constitutes a Riesz basis in a certain weighted $L^2$-space, provided that the
boundary conditions are strictly regular.
  The main results are applied to establish asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues
and eigenvectors, and the Riesz basis property for the dynamic generator of the
Timoshenko beam model. We also found a new case when eigenvalues have an
explicit asymptotic, which to the best of our knowledge is new even in the case
of constant parameters of the model.

Electrocardiogram (ECG), an unobtrusive alternative to EEG, is more suitable,

suffers from information sparsity. In this paper, we propose \emph{TopNet} to
alleviate this problem, by leveraging the recent advances in neural topic
modeling to obtain high-quality skeleton words to complement the short input.
In particular, instead of directly generating a story, we first learn to map
the short text input to a low-dimensional topic distribution (which is
pre-assigned by a topic model). Based on this latent topic distribution, we can
use the reconstruction decoder of the topic model to sample a sequence of
inter-related words as a skeleton for the story. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that our proposed framework is highly effective in skeleton word
selection and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both
automatic evaluation and human evaluation.

important solid-state quantum systems. It has applications to fields including
high-precision sensing, quantum computing, single photon communication,
metrology, nanoscale magnetic imaging and biosensing. For all of these
applications, a high quantum yield of emitted photons is desirable. However,
diamond samples engineered to have high densities of nitrogen-vacancy centres
show levels of brightness varying significantly within single batches, or even
within the same sample. Here we show that nearby nitrogen impurities quench
emission of nitrogen-vacancy centres via non-radiative transitions, resulting
in a reduced fluorescence quantum yield. We monitored the emission properties
of nitrogen-vacancy centre ensembles from synthetic diamond samples with
different concentrations of nitrogen impurities. While at low nitrogen
densities of 1.81 ppm we measured a lifetime of 13.9 ns, we observed a strong
reduction in lifetime with increasing nitrogen density. We measure a lifetime
as low as 4.4 ns at a nitrogen density of 380 ppm. The change in lifetime
matches a reduction in relative fluorescence quantum yield from 77.4 % to 32 %
with an increase in nitrogen density from 88 ppm to 380 ppm, respectively.
These results will inform the conditions required to optimise the properties of
diamond crystals devices based on the fluorescence of nitrogen-vacancy centres.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the origin of inhomogeneities
observed in high-density nitrogen-vacancy ensembles within diamonds and
nanodiamonds.

results show that for every 100\% increase in the ratio of house price to

mobile population of working age at the inflow location will decrease by
4.42\%, and the marginal effect of relative house price on labor force

criterion has yet been put forward to tune the parameters of these models and
select maps that best approximate the ground truth. To perform this task, we
propose to leverage the Brenier formulation of OT.Theoretically, we show that
this formulation guarantees that, up to sharp a distortion parameter depending

selected map achieves the lowest quadratic error to the ground truth. This
criterion, estimated via convex optimization, enables parameter tuning and
model selection among entropic regularization of OT, input convex neural

use this criterion to question the use of OT in Domain-Adaptation (DA). In a
standard DA experiment, it enables us to identify the potential that is closest
to the true OT map between the source and the target. Yet, we observe that this
selected potential is far from being the one that performs best for the

represents the traffic dynamics at the whole urban scale. We assume the users

price at equilibrium under TCS. The travel times are linearized with respect to
the modal shares to improve the convergence. We then present a method to find

finding a proper configuration of the software system) to meet their goals for

of the problem is of course that performance depends on the input data: a video
as input to an encoder like x264 or a file system fed to a tool like xz. To
achieve good performance, users should therefore take into account both
dimensions of (1) software variability and (2) input data. In this
problem-statement paper, we conduct a large study over 8 configurable systems
that quantifies the existing interactions between input data and configurations
of software systems. The results exhibit that (1) inputs fed to software
systems interact with their configuration options in non monotonous ways,
significantly impacting their performance properties (2) tuning a software
system for its input data makes it possible to multiply its performance by up

dielectric functions of metals which lead to nearly the same response, as the

the case of evanescent waves. Unlike some previous suggestions of this type,
the response functions considered here depend on all components of the wave

shown that these response functions satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relations. We
derive respective expressions for the surface impedances and reflection

pressure between two parallel plates, the Casimir force between a sphere and a

of AGNs that show the appearance (or disappearance) of broad emission lines
within a short time scale (months to years) and are often associated with the
dramatic change of their continuum emissions. They provide us an unprecedented
chance to directly investigate the host galaxy properties with minimal
contamination from the luminous central engine during the ""turn-off"" state,
which is difficult for normal luminous AGNs. In this work, for the first time,
we systematically characterize the stellar populations and star formation
histories (SFHs) of host galaxies for 26 turn-off CL-AGNs using the stellar
population synthesis code STARLIGHT. We find that the stellar populations of
CL-AGNs are similar to that of normal AGNs, excepts that the intermediate
stellar populations contribute more fraction. We estimate their stellar
velocity dispersions ($\rm \sigma_{\star}$) and black hole masses ($\rm
M_{BH,vir}$) and find that CL-AGNs also follow the overall $\rm
M_{BH}-\sigma_{\star}$ relationship. We also confirm the previous claim that
CL-AGNs tend to be biased towards lower Eddington ratio, and their extreme
variabilities are more likely due to the intrinsic changes of accretion rates.
In addition, CL-AGNs with recent star formations (SF) tend to have higher
Eddington ratio. Compared with previous studies, our analysis suggests that
there may be a correlation between the CL-AGN host galaxy properties and their
CL phenomena.

This unusual behavior is caused by an interplay between strong fluid-fluid

the fluid particles; weak Yukawa attraction between fluid and obstacles only
slightly enhances the fluid-fluid bonding. At low enough temperature the

objective (e.g., minimizing latency). Yet, due to the software's intrinsically
complex configuration landscape and expensive measurement, there has been a
rather mild success, particularly in preventing the search from being trapped
in local optima. To address this issue, in this paper we take a different
perspective. Instead of focusing on improving the optimizer, we work on the
level of optimization model and propose a meta multi-objectivization (MMO)
model that considers an auxiliary performance objective (e.g., throughput in
addition to latency). What makes this model unique is that we do not optimize
the auxiliary performance objective, but rather use it to make
similarly-performing while different configurations less comparable (i.e.
Pareto nondominated to each other), thus preventing the search from being
trapped in local optima. Importantly through a new normalization method we show
how to effectively use the MMO model without worrying about its weight -- the
only yet highly sensitive parameter that can affect its effectiveness.
Experiments on 22 cases from 11 real-world software systems/environments
confirm that our MMO model with the new normalization performs better than its
state-of-the-art single-objective counterparts on 82% cases while achieving up
to 2.09x speedup. For 67% of the cases, the new normalization also enables the
MMO model to outperform the instance when using it with the normalization used
in our prior FSE work under pre-tuned best weights, saving a great amount of
resources which would be otherwise necessary to find a good weight. We also
demonstrate that the MMO model with the new normalization can consolidate
Flash, a recent model-based tuning tool, on 68% of the cases with 1.22x speedup

obtained precise photometry in twelve specially designed filters for large
numbers of Galactic stars. Deriving their precise stellar atmospheric
parameters and individual elemental abundances is crucial for studies of
Galactic structure, and the assembly history and chemical evolution of our
Galaxy. Aims. Our goal is to estimate not only stellar parameters (effective
temperature, Teff, surface gravity, log g, and metallicity, [Fe/H]), but also
[{\alpha}/Fe] and four elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and
[Ca/Fe]) using data from J-PLUS DR1. Methods. By combining recalibrated
photometric data from J-PLUS DR1, Gaia DR2, and spectroscopic labels from
LAMOST, we design and train a set of cost-sensitive neural networks, the CSNet,
to learn the non-linear mapping from stellar colors to their labels. Results.
We have achieved precisions of {\delta}Teff {\sim}55K,
{\delta}logg{\sim}0.15dex, and {\delta}[Fe/H]{\sim}0.07dex, respectively, over
a wide range of temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. The
uncertainties of the abundance estimates for [{\alpha}/Fe] and the four
individual elements are in the range 0.04-0.08 dex. We compare our parameter
and abundance estimates with those from other spectroscopic catalogs such as
APOGEE and GALAH, and find an overall good agreement. Conclusions. Our results
demonstrate the potential of well-designed, high-quality photometric data for
determinations of stellar parameters as well as individual elemental
abundances. Applying the method to J-PLUS DR1, we have obtained the
aforementioned parameters for about two million stars, providing an outstanding
data set for chemo-dynamic analyses of the Milky Way. The catalog of the
estimated parameters is publicly accessible.

boundary method (SBM) for continuous Galerkin discretizations of conservation
laws in embedded domains. We impose the interface conditions weakly and
approximate surface integrals by volume integrals. The discretized weak form of
the governing equation has the structure of an immersed boundary finite element
method. That is, integration is performed over a fixed fictitious domain.
Source terms are included to account for interface conditions and extend the
boundary data into the complement of the embedded domain. The calculation of
these extra terms requires (i) construction of an approximate delta function
and (ii) extrapolation of embedded boundary data into quadrature points. We
accomplish these tasks using a level set function, which is given analytically
or evolved numerically. A globally defined averaged gradient of this
approximate signed distance function is used to construct a simple map to the
closest point on the interface. The normal and tangential derivatives of the
numerical solution at that point are calculated using the interface conditions
and/or interpolation on uniform stencils. Similarly to SBM, extrapolation back
to the quadrature points is performed using Taylor expansions. The same
strategy is used to construct ghost penalty functions and extension velocities.
Computations that require extrapolation are restricted to a narrow band around
the interface. Numerical results are presented for elliptic, parabolic, and
hyperbolic test problems, which are specifically designed to assess the error
caused by the numerical treatment of interface conditions on fixed and moving
boundaries in 2D.

finite-time $\tau$ initialization with an error probability $\epsilon$. The
thermodynamic length $\mathcal{L}(\epsilon)$ between the states before and
after initializing in the parametric space increases monotonously as the error
decreases. For example, in the constant dissipation coefficient ($\gamma_{0}$)
case, the minimal additional cost is $0.997k_{B}T/(\gamma_{0}\tau)$ for
$\epsilon=1\%$ and $1.288k_{B}T/(\gamma_{0}\tau)$ for $\epsilon=0.1\%$.

quantum batteries. However, self-discharging, the process of charge wasting of

The effects of local field fluctuation, introduced by disorder term in
Hamiltonian of the system, on the performance of the quantum batteries is
investigated in this paper. The results reveal that the disorder term could
compensate disruptive effects of the decoherence, i.e. self-discharging, and
hence improve the performance of the quantum battery via ""incoherent gain of
ergotropy"" procedure. Adjusting the strength of disorder parameter to a proper
value and choosing a suitable initial state of quantum battery, the amount of
free ergotropy, defined with respect to free Hamiltonian, could exceed the
amount of initial stored ergotropy. In addition harnessing the degree of
disorder parameter could help to enhance the half-life time of the quantum
battery. This study opens perspective to further investigation of the
performance of quantum batteries that explore disorder and many-body effects.

compartmental SIR model and its extensions from the now classical work of
Kermack-Mackendrick. In contrast, epidemic modelling of marine ecosystems is a
bit behind, and compartmental models have been introduced only recently. One of
the reasons is that many epidemic processes in terrestrial ecosystems can be
described through a contact process, while modelling marine epidemics is more
subtle in many cases. Here we present a model describing disease outbreaks
caused by parasites in bivalve populations. The SIRP model is a
multicompartmental model with four compartments, three of which describe the
different states of the host, susceptible (i.e. healthy), S, infected, I, and
removed (dead), R, and one compartment for the parasite in the marine medium,
P, written as a 4-dimensional dynamical system. Even if this is the simplest
model one can write to describe this system, it is still too complicated for
both direct analytical manipulation and direct comparison with experimental
observations, as it depends on four parameters to be fitted. We show that it is
possible to simplify the model, including a reduction to the standard SIR model
if the parameters fulfil certain conditions. The model is validated with
available data for the recent Mass Mortality Event of the noble pen shell Pinna
nobilis, a disease caused by the parasite Haplosporidium pinnae, showing that
the reduced SIR model is able to fit the data. So, we show that a model in
which the species that suffers the epidemics (host) cannot move, and contagion
occurs through parasites, can be reduced to the standard SIR model that
represents epidemic transmission between mobile hosts. The fit indicates that
the assumptions made to simplify the model are reasonable in practice, although
it leads to an indeterminacy in three of the original parameters.

independent components, which are connected via high-speed RDMA networks,
greatly improving resource utilization of databases. However, such an
architecture poses unique challenges to data indexing in databases due to
limited RDMA semantics and near-zero computation power at memory-side. Existing
indexes supporting disaggregated memory either suffer from low write
performance, or require hardware modification.
  This paper presents Sherman, a write-optimized distributed B+Tree index on
disaggregated memory that delivers high performance with commodity RDMA NICs.
Sherman combines RDMA hardware features and RDMA-friendly software techniques
to boost index write performance from three angles. First, to reduce round
trips, Sherman coalesces dependent RDMA commands by leveraging in-order
delivery property of RDMA. Second, to accelerate concurrent accesses, Sherman
introduces a hierarchical lock that exploits on-chip memory of RDMA NICs.
Finally, to mitigate write amplification, Sherman tailors the data structure
layout of B+Tree with a two-level version mechanism. Our evaluation shows that,
Sherman is one order of magnitude faster in terms of both throughput and 99th
percentile latency on typical write-intensive workloads, compared with

adversarial attacks. However, it exhibits much more severe overfitting than
training on clean inputs. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon from the
perspective of training instances, i.e., training input-target pairs. Based on
a quantitative metric measuring instances' difficulty, we analyze the model's
behavior on training instances of different difficulty levels. This lets us
show that the decay in generalization performance of adversarial training is a
result of the model's attempt to fit hard adversarial instances. We
theoretically verify our observations for both linear and general nonlinear
models, proving that models trained on hard instances have worse generalization
performance than ones trained on easy instances. Furthermore, we prove that the
difference in the generalization gap between models trained by instances of
different difficulty levels increases with the size of the adversarial budget.
Finally, we conduct case studies on methods mitigating adversarial overfitting
in several scenarios. Our analysis shows that methods successfully mitigating
adversarial overfitting all avoid fitting hard adversarial instances, while
ones fitting hard adversarial instances do not achieve true robustness.

nonlinear partial differential algebraic equations to obtain thermal, hydraulic

challenges of inefficiency and bad robustness. For one thing, the frequent
update and factorization of Jacobian matrices utilize high CPU time. For
another, the per-step iteration numbers grow exponentially as the system
loading level creeps up. This paper presents a novel non-iterative algorithm
for the quasi-dynamic energy flow calculation. The kernel of the proposed
algorithm is to transform these nonlinear equations into linear recursive ones,
by solving which, we obtain explicit closed-form solutions of unknown
variables. In each step, the proposed algorithm requires only one matrix
factorization and fixed times of arithmetic operations regardless of the
loading levels, so that it achieves small and consistent per-step time costs. A
semi-discrete scheme is used in PDE solution to avoid dissipative and
dispersive errors that are often overlooked in previous literature. To ensure
convergence, we also propose to control the temporal step sizes adaptively by
estimating the simulation errors. Case studies showed that the proposed method
manifested efficient and robust time performance compared with the iterative
algorithms, and meanwhile preserved high accuracy.

studied in this paper. Three formulations of the $f(R)$ gravity with dynamical
shifts (which are all based on the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism of the
equations) are investigated. These three formulations are all proved to be
strongly hyperbolic by pseudodifferential reduction. The first one is the
Baumagarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) formulation with the so-called
""hyperbolic $K$-driver"" condition and the ""hyperbolic Gamma driver"" condition.
The second one is the ADM formulation with modified harmonic gauge conditions.
We find that the equations are not strong hyperbolic in traditional Z4
formulation for $f(R)$ gravity. So, in the third formulation, we improve the Z4
formulation, and show these equations are strong hyperbolic with modified
harmonic gauge conditions.

  Text",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Answering natural language questions using information from tables (TableQA)
is of considerable recent interest. In many applications, tables occur not in
isolation, but embedded in, or linked to unstructured text. Often, a question
is best answered by matching its parts to either table cell contents or
unstructured text spans, and extracting answers from either source. This leads
to a new space of TextTableQA problems that was introduced by the HybridQA
dataset. Existing adaptations of table representation to transformer-based
reading comprehension (RC) architectures fail to tackle the diverse modalities
of the two representations through a single system. Training such systems is
further challenged by the need for distant supervision. To reduce cognitive
burden, training instances usually include just the question and answer, the
latter matching multiple table rows and text passages. This leads to a noisy
multi-instance training regime involving not only rows of the table, but also
spans of linked text. We respond to these challenges by proposing MITQA, a new
TextTableQA system that explicitly models the different but closely-related
probability spaces of table row selection and text span selection. Our
experiments indicate the superiority of our approach compared to recent
baselines. The proposed method is currently at the top of the HybridQA
leaderboard with a held out test set, achieving 21 % absolute improvement on
both EM and F1 scores over previous published results.

encouragingly gained wide popularity; However, constrained by the lack of
long-range non-linear temporal relation modeling and reverse motion information
modeling, the performance of existing models is, therefore, undercut seriously.
To address this urgent problem, we introduce a startling Temporal Transformer
Network with Self-supervision (TTSN). Our high-performance TTSN mainly consists
of a temporal transformer module and a temporal sequence self-supervision
module. Concisely speaking, we utilize the efficient temporal transformer
module to model the non-linear temporal dependencies among non-local frames,
which significantly enhances complex motion feature representations. The
temporal sequence self-supervision module we employ unprecedentedly adopts the
streamlined strategy of ""random batch random channel"" to reverse the sequence
of video frames, allowing robust extractions of motion information
representation from inversed temporal dimensions and improving the
generalization capability of the model. Extensive experiments on three widely
used datasets (HMDB51, UCF101, and Something-something V1) have conclusively
demonstrated that our proposed TTSN is promising as it successfully achieves
state-of-the-art performance for action recognition.

cosmological results when using a Gaussian likelihood. In this paper we study
the covariance of pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimates of tomographic cosmic shear power
spectra. Using two existing publicly available codes in combination, we
calculate the full covariance matrix, including mode-coupling contributions
arising from both partial sky coverage and non-linear structure growth. For
three different sky masks, we compare the theoretical covariance matrix to that
estimated from publicly available N-body weak lensing simulations, finding good
agreement. We find that as a more extreme sky cut is applied, a corresponding
increase in both Gaussian off-diagonal covariance and non-Gaussian super-sample
covariance is observed in both theory and simulations, in accordance with
expectations. Studying the different contributions to the covariance in detail,
we find that the Gaussian covariance dominates along the main diagonal and the
closest off-diagonals, but further away from the main diagonal the super-sample
covariance is dominant. Forming mock constraints in parameters describing
matter clustering and dark energy, we find that neglecting non-Gaussian
contributions to the covariance can lead to underestimating the true size of
confidence regions by up to 70 per cent. The dominant non-Gaussian covariance
component is the super-sample covariance, but neglecting the smaller connected
non-Gaussian covariance can still lead to the underestimation of uncertainties
by 10--20 per cent. A real cosmological analysis will require marginalisation
over many nuisance parameters, which will decrease the relative importance of
all cosmological contributions to the covariance, so these values should be
taken as upper limits on the importance of each component.

$builder$ -- which performs actions but ignores the goal of the task, i.e. has
no access to rewards -- and an $architect$ which guides the builder towards the
goal of the task. We define and explore a formal setting where artificial
agents are equipped with mechanisms that allow them to simultaneously learn a
task while at the same time evolving a shared communication protocol. Ideally,
such learning should only rely on high-level communication priors and be able
to handle a large variety of tasks and meanings while deriving communication
protocols that can be reused across tasks. We present the Architect-Builder
Problem (ABP): an asymmetrical setting in which an architect must learn to
guide a builder towards constructing a specific structure. The architect knows
the target structure but cannot act in the environment and can only send
arbitrary messages to the builder. The builder on the other hand can act in the
environment, but receives no rewards nor has any knowledge about the task, and
must learn to solve it relying only on the messages sent by the architect.
Crucially, the meaning of messages is initially not defined nor shared between
the agents but must be negotiated throughout learning. Under these constraints,
we propose Architect-Builder Iterated Guiding (ABIG), a solution to ABP where
the architect leverages a learned model of the builder to guide it while the
builder uses self-imitation learning to reinforce its guided behavior. We
analyze the key learning mechanisms of ABIG and test it in 2D tasks involving
grasping cubes, placing them at a given location, or building various shapes.
ABIG results in a low-level, high-frequency, guiding communication protocol
that not only enables an architect-builder pair to solve the task at hand, but
that can also generalize to unseen tasks.

Furthermore, they can be coupled easily with additional constraints which opens
the way to various applications illustrating the flexibility and effectiveness
of our approach: mean curvature flows with volume constraint, multiphase mean
curvature flows, numerical approximation of Steiner trees or minimal surfaces.

We show that the EI may undergo first- or second-order thermal transitions
depending on the regime whereupon this phase is approached. We also investigate
the expected thermodynamic signatures for the specific heat above the
fine-tuned excitonic quantum critical point (EQCP), in both 2d and 3d, in the
SMC regime. We show that the EQCP is a different kind of critical point since
although the EOP vanishes at the EQCP, there is always a finite gap in the SMC

scaling behavior in the form $C_V/T \propto T^{(d-z)/z}$, where $d$ is the
dimension of the system and $z$ is the dynamical critical exponent. The very
low temperature behavior has a dominant exponential thermally activated term

This paper presents new radio observations of the galaxy cluster

kpc at 1283 MHz, significantly larger than previously believed, and has a
flatter spectral index ($\alpha = -0.97 \pm 0.05$) than typically expected. Our
X-ray analysis clearly reveals a large-scale (254 kpc) sloshing spiral in the
intracluster medium. We perform a point-to-point analysis, finding a tight
single correlation between radio and X-ray surface brightness with a
super-linear slope of $b_{\rm 1283~MHz} = 1.16^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and $b_{\rm
145~MHz} = 1.15^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$; this indicates a strong link between the
thermal and non-thermal components of the intracluster medium. Conversely, in
the spectral index/X-ray surface brightness plane, we find that regions inside
and outside the sloshing spiral follow different correlations. We find
compelling evidence for multiple sub-components in this mini-halo for the first
time. While both the turbulent (re-)acceleration and hadronic scenarios are
able to explain some observed properties of the mini-halo in MS1455.0$+$2232,
neither scenario is able to account for all the evidence presented by our

  Self-Learning",,,,,"cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  User identity linkage, which aims to link identities of a natural person
across different social platforms, has attracted increasing research interest
recently. Existing approaches usually first embed the identities as
deterministic vectors in a shared latent space, and then learn a classifier
based on the available annotations. However, the formation and characteristics
of real-world social platforms are full of uncertainties, which makes these
deterministic embedding based methods sub-optimal. In addition, it is
intractable to collect sufficient linkage annotations due to the tremendous
gaps between different platforms. Semi-supervised models utilize the unlabeled
data to help capture the intrinsic data distribution, which are more promising
in practical usage. However, the existing semi-supervised linkage methods
heavily rely on the heuristically defined similarity measurements to
incorporate the innate closeness between labeled and unlabeled samples. Such
manually designed assumptions may not be consistent with the actual linkage
signals and further introduce the noises. To address the mentioned limitations,
in this paper we propose a novel Noise-aware Semi-supervised Variational User
Identity Linkage (NSVUIL) model. Specifically, we first propose a novel
supervised linkage module to incorporate the available annotations. Each social
identity is represented by a Gaussian distribution in the Wasserstein space to
simultaneously preserve the fine-grained social profiles and model the
uncertainty of identities. Then, a noise-aware self-learning module is designed
to faithfully augment the few available annotations, which is capable of
filtering noises from the pseudo-labels generated by the supervised module.

performance gain and computational efficiency cannot be attained, which has
motivated us to study the inefficiencies in existing encoder-decoder structures

module identifies the complementary channel and important spatial information.
To improve the decoder performance and computational efficiency, we minimize
the decoder block usage with object attention module. This module extracts
undetected objects and edge information from refined channels and spatial
representations. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive pixel intensity loss
function to deal with the relatively important pixels unlike conventional loss
functions which treat all pixels equally. A comparison with 13 existing methods
reveals that TRACER achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark

the other on right-wing news outlets. Our hypothesis is that a word's
representations in both word embedding spaces are more similar for non-biased
words than biased words. The underlying idea is that the context of biased
words in different news outlets varies more strongly than the one of non-biased

context. While we do not find statistical significance to accept the
hypothesis, the results show the effectiveness of the approach. For example,
after a linear mapping of both word embeddings spaces, 31% of the words with
the largest distances potentially induce bias. To improve the results, we find
that the dataset needs to be significantly larger, and we derive further
methodology as future research direction. To our knowledge, this paper presents
the first in-depth look at the context of bias words measured by word

cardiac diseases. To acquire the spatial signal characteristics from the
thorax, multiple electrodes are commonly used. Displacements of electrodes
affect the signal morphologies and can lead to incorrect diagnoses. For
quantitative analysis of these effects we propose the usage of a numerical
computer simulation. In order to create a realistic representation of the human
thorax including the heart and lung a three-dimensional model with a simplified
geometry is used. The electrical excitation of the heart is modelled on a
cellular level via the bidomain approach. To numerically solve the differential
equations, describing the signal propagation within the body, we use the finite
element method in COMSOL Multiphysics. The spatial gradients of the simulated
body potentials are calculated to determine placement sensitivity maps. The
simulated results show that the sensitivity is different for each considered
point in time of each ECG wave. In general, the impact of displacement is
increased as an electrode is more closely located to the signal source.
However, in some specific regions associated with differential ECG leads the
placement sensitivity distribution deviates from this simple circular pattern.
The results provide useful information to enhance the understanding of placed
specific effects on classical ECG features. By additional consideration of
patient-specific characteristics in the future, the used model has the ability
to investigate additional body-related aspects such as geometrical body shape
or composition of various tissue types.

report news in a biased way. While such bias can be introduced by altering the
word choice or omitting information, the perception of bias also varies largely
depending on a reader's personal background. Therefore, media bias is a very
complex construct to identify and analyze. Even though media bias has been the
subject of many studies, previous assessment strategies are oversimplified,
lack overlap and empirical evaluation. Thus, this study aims to develop a scale
that can be used as a reliable standard to evaluate article bias. To name an
example: Intending to measure bias in a news article, should we ask, ""How
biased is the article?"" or should we instead ask, ""How did the article treat
the American president?"". We conducted a literature search to find 824 relevant
questions about text perception in previous research on the topic. In a

semantically to conclude a complete and representative set of possible question

reprocessed by the torus of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), e.g., UXCLUMPY,
CTORUS, and MYTORUS. They span a range of assumed torus geometries and
morphologies-some posit smooth gas distributions, and others posit
distributions of clouds. It is suspected that given the quality of currently
available data, certain model parameters, such as coronal power law photon
index and parameters determining the morphology of the AGN torus, may be poorly
constrained due to model degeneracies. In this work, we test the reliability of
these models in terms of recovery of parameters and the ability to discern the
morphology of the torus using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectral data. We perform
extensive simulations of X-ray spectra of Compton-thick AGNs under six X-ray
spectral models of the torus. We use Bayesian methods to investigate degeneracy
between model parameters, distinguish models and determine the dependence of
the parameter constraints on the instruments used. For typical exposure times
and fluxes for nearby Compton-thick AGN, we find that several parameters across
the models used here cannot be well constrained, e.g., the distribution of
clouds, the number of clouds in the radial direction, even when the applied
model is correct. We also find that Bayesian evidence values can robustly
distinguish between a correct and a wrong model only if there is sufficient
energy coverage and only if the intrinsic flux of the object is above a
particular value determined by the instrument combination and the model
considered.

Our implementation uses commercially available components, including
distributed-feedback and Fabry--Perot laser diodes, and silicon nitride
photonic circuits with microresonators fabricated in commercial multi-project

requirements on microresonator spectral purity and Q-factor, so that we can
generate soliton microcombs resilient to thermal frequency drift and with
pump-to-comb sideband efficiency of up to 40\% at mW power levels. We
demonstrate down-conversion of the optical spectrum from 1400 nm to 1700 nm

is often performed using ray-tracing codes, which rely on the
geometrical-optics (GO) approximation. However, GO fails at caustics such as
cutoffs and focal points, erroneously predicting the wave intensity to be
infinite. This is a critical shortcoming of GO, since the caustic wave
intensity is often the quantity of interest, e.g. RF heating. Full-wave
modeling can be used instead, but the computational cost limits the speed at
which such optimizations can be performed. We have developed a less expensive
alternative called metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO). Instead of evolving
waves in the usual $\textbf{x}$ (coordinate) or $\text{k}$ (spectral)
representation, MGO uses a mixed $\textbf{X} \equiv \textsf{A}\textbf{x} +
\textsf{B}\textbf{k}$ representation. By continuously adjusting the matrix
coefficients $\textsf{A}$ and $\textsf{B}$ along the rays, one can ensure that
GO remains valid in the $\textbf{X}$ coordinates without caustic singularities.
The caustic-free result is then mapped back onto the original $\textbf{x}$
space using metaplectic transforms. Here, we overview the MGO theory and review
algorithms that will aid the development of an MGO-based ray-tracing code. We
show how using orthosymplectic transformations leads to considerable
simplifications compared to previously published MGO formulas. We also prove
explicitly that MGO exactly reproduces standard GO when evaluated far from
caustics (an important property which until now has only been inferred from
numerical simulations), and we relate MGO to other semiclassical
caustic-removal schemes published in the literature. This discussion is then
augmented by an explicit comparison of the computed spectrum for a wave bounded
between two cutoffs.

approach and employ it to predict ECT treatment response. To this end, we
derive a formal association between Postictal Suppression Index (PSI) - an ECT
seizure quality index - and whole-brain modal and average controllability, NCT
metrics based on white matter brain network architecture, respectively.
Exploiting the known association of ECT response and PSI, we then hypothesized
an association between our controllability metrics and ECT response mediated by
PSI. We formally tested this conjecture in N=50 depressive patients undergoing
ECT. We show that whole-brain controllability metrics based on pre-ECT
structural connectome data predict ECT response in accordance with our
hypotheses. In addition, we show the expected mediation effects via PSI.
Importantly, our theoretically motivated metrics are at least on par with
extensive machine learning models based on pre-ECT connectome data. In summary,
we derived and tested a control-theoretic framework capable of predicting ECT

quantitative predictions regarding individual therapeutic response, which are

find that cyclic shear utilizing multiple shear planes presents hierarchical
compaction, producing progressively lower steady state energies compared to a

possible to achieve steady state limit-cycles of tunable periodicities using
different combinations of the three orthogonal strain directions. We find that
such protocols exhibit better annealing as compared to protocols with steady

Follow-up programs of TESS targets significantly increased the number of
confirmed planets with mass measurements, allowing for a more detailed
statistical analysis of multi-planet systems. In this work we explore the
similarity in radii, masses, densities, and period ratios of planets within
planetary systems. We show that planets in the same system that are similar in
radii could be rather different in mass and vice versa and that typically the
planetary radii of a given planetary system are more similar than the masses.
We also find that a transition in the ""peas in the pod"" pattern for planets

increasing the number of detected systems is crucial for understanding the

single beam and multibeam systems allow detection of free gas, bubbles, in the
water even from a great distance, exact quantification utilizing the
hydroacoustic data requires additional parameters such as rise speed and bubble
size distribution. Optical methods are complementary in the sense that they can
provide high temporal and spatial resolution of single bubbles or bubble
streams from close distance. In this contribution we introduce a complete
instrument and evaluation method for optical bubble stream characterization
targeted at flows of up to 100ml/min and bubbles with a few millimeters radius.
The dedicated instrument employs a high-speed deep sea capable stereo camera
system that can record terabytes of bubble imagery when deployed at a seep site
for later automated analysis. Bubble characteristics can be obtained for short
sequences, then relocating the instrument to other locations, or in autonomous
mode of definable intervals up to several days, in order to capture bubble flow
variations due to e.g. tide dependent pressure changes or reservoir depletion.
Beside reporting the steps to make bubble characterization robust and
autonomous, we carefully evaluate the reachable accuracy to be in the range of
1-2\% of the bubble radius and propose a novel auto-calibration procedure that,
due to the lack of point correspondences, uses only the silhouettes of bubbles.
The system has been operated successfully in 1000m water depth at the Cascadia
margin offshore Oregon to assess methane fluxes from various seep locations.
Besides sample results we also report failure cases and lessons learnt during
deployment and method development.

changes, pose a significant challenge for medical image registration.
Traditional registration methods need to iteratively optimize an objective

tuning, but which have limited capabilities in registering images with large
deformations. While deep learning-based methods can learn the complex mapping
from input images to their respective deformation field, it is regression-based
and is prone to be stuck at local minima, particularly when large deformations
are involved. To this end, we present Stochastic Planner-Actor-Critic (SPAC), a
novel reinforcement learning-based framework that performs step-wise
registration. The key notion is warping a moving image successively by each
time step to finally align to a fixed image. Considering that it is challenging
to handle high dimensional continuous action and state spaces in the
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) framework, we introduce a new concept
`Plan' to the standard Actor-Critic model, which is of low dimension and can
facilitate the actor to generate a tractable high dimensional action. The
entire framework is based on unsupervised training and operates in an
end-to-end manner. We evaluate our method on several 2D and 3D medical image

intermittent audio and video streams disturbed by noise. Moreover, a unique
cross-modal self-supervised learning method is presented to model the
confidence of audio and visual observations by leveraging the complementarity

the proposed MPT achieves 98.6% and 78.3% tracking accuracy on the standard and

We confirm that SMGs with brighter $S_{870}$ are located at higher redshifts.

chemical evolution of the Galaxy by measurements of very metal-poor stars.
There are, however, only a few useful spectral lines of these elements in the
optical range that are measurable for such low-metallicity stars. Here we
report on abundances of these two elements determined from near-infrared
high-resolution spectra obtained with the Subaru Telescope Infrared Doppler
instrument (IRD). Si abundances are determined for as many as 26 Si lines for
six very and extremely metal-poor stars (-4.0<[Fe/H]<-1.5), which significantly
improves the reliability of the abundance measurements. All six stars,
including three carbon-enhanced objects, show over-abundances of Si
([Si/Fe]~+0.5). Two stars with [Fe/H]~-1.5 have relatively small
over-abundances. The [Mg/Si] ratios agree with the solar value, except for one
metal-poor star with carbon excess. Strontium abundances are determined from
the triplet lines for four stars, including two for the first time. The
consistency of the Sr abundances determined from near-infrared and optical
spectra require further examination from additional observations.

  Few-Shot Intent Detection",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of the core components of goal-oriented dialog systems is the task of
Intent Detection. Few-shot Learning upon Intent Detection is challenging due to
the scarcity of available annotated utterances. Although recent works making

is still challenging in large label spaces and much smaller number of shots.
Generalized Few-shot learning is more difficult due to the presence of both
novel and seen classes during the testing phase. In this work, we propose a
simple and effective method based on Natural Language Inference that not only
tackles the problem of few shot intent detection, but also proves useful in
zero-shot and generalized few shot learning problems. Our extensive experiments
on a number of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Spoken Language
Understanding (SLU) datasets show the effectiveness of our approach. In
addition, we highlight the settings in which our NLI based method outperforms
the baselines by huge margins.

strategic game among the leaders, we show that pure Nash equilibria may fail to

tight, meaning that there is an instance that does not admit an
$\alpha$-approximate equilibrium for any $\alpha<K$. Thus $\alpha=K$ is the
smallest possible value of $\alpha$ such that the existence of an

players that have similar player-specific coefficients in our regression model,
which allows us to discover common play styles amongst our sample of

several advantages: the number of common play styles do not need to be
specified, players can move between multiple clusters, and the resulting
groupings often have a straight-forward interpretations. We examine the most
common play styles among Battlefield 3 players in detail and find groups of
players that exhibit overall high performance, as well as groupings of players
that perform particularly well in specific game types, maps and roles. We are
also able to differentiate between players that are stable members of a
particular play style from hybrid players that exhibit multiple play styles
across their matches. Modeling this landscape of different play styles will aid
game developers in developing specialized tutorials for new participants as

of this type now allowing some kinetic terms to be absent, analogously to the
Green-Schwarz superstring $\sigma$-model on $\mathbb{Z}_4$-symmetric
homogeneous spaces. A list of such integrable $\mathbb{Z}_N$-symmetric
(super)coset $\sigma$-models for $N \leq 6$ and their Lax pairs is presented.
For arbitrary $N$, a big class of integrable models is constructed that
includes both the known pure spinor and Green-Schwarz superstring on
$\mathbb{Z}_4$-symmetric cosets.
  Integrable Yang-Baxter deformations of this class of $\mathbb{Z}_N$-symmetric
(super)coset $\sigma$-models can be constructed in same way as in the known
$\mathbb{Z}_2$- or $\mathbb{Z}_4$-cases. Deformations based on solutions of the
modified classical Yang-Baxter equation, the so-called $\eta$-deformation,
require deformation of the constants defining the Lagrangian and the
corresponding Lax pair. Homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations (i.e. those based
on solutions to the classical Yang-Baxter equation) leave the equations of
motion and consequently the Lax pair invariant and are expected to be
classically equivalent to the undeformed model.
  As an example, the relationship between $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric homogeneous
spaces and nearly (para-)K\""ahler geometries is revisited. Confirming existing
literature it is shown that the integrable choice of WZ-term in the
$\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric coset $\sigma$-model associated to a nearly K\""ahler

then each pair of its $k$-colorings are $k$-Kempe equivalent. Mohar conjectured
the same conclusion for connected $k$-regular graphs. This was proved for $k=3$

also called the 3-prism) and for $k\ge 4$ by Bonamy, Bousquet, Feghali, and

  In this paper we prove an analogous result for list-coloring. For a
list-assignment $L$ and an $L$-coloring $\varphi$, a Kempe swap is called
$L$-valid for $\varphi$ if performing the Kempe swap yields another
$L$-coloring. Two $L$-colorings are called $L$-equivalent if we can form one

implies an alternate proof of the result of Bonamy et al.
  Our proofs rely on the following key lemma, which may be of independent
interest. Let $H$ be a graph such that for every degree-assignment $L_H$ all
$L_H$-colorings are $L_H$-equivalent. If $G$ is a connected graph that contains
$H$ as an induced subgraph, then for every degree-assignment $L_G$ for $G$ all

Maderna-Venturelli in their remarkable paper [Ann. Math. 2020] proved the
existence of hyperbolic motions with any positive energy constant, starting
from any configuration and along any non-collision configuration. Their
original proof relies on the long time behavior of solutions by Chazy 1922 and
Marchal-Saari 1976, on the H\""{o}lder estimate for Ma\~{n}\'{e}'s potential by
Maderna 2012, and on the weak KAM theory.
  We give a new and completely different proof for the above existence of
hyperbolic motions. The central idea is that, via some geometric observation,
we build up uniform estimates for Euclidean length and angle of geodesics of
Ma\~{n}\'{e}'s potential starting from a given configuration and ending at the
ray along a given non-collision configuration. Note that we do not need any of
the above previous studies used in Maderna-Venturelli's proof.
  Moreover, our geometric approach works for Hamiltonians
$\frac12\|p\|^2-F(x)$, where $F(x)\ge 0$ is lower semicontinuous and decreases
very slowly to $0$ faraway from collisions. We therefore obtain the existence
of hyperbolic motions to such Hamiltonians with any positive energy constant,
starting from any admissible configuration and along any non-collision
configuration. Consequently, for several important potentials $F\in
C^{2}(\Omega)$, we get similar existence of hyperbolic motions to the
generalized $N$-body system $\ddot{x} = \nabla_x F(x)$, which is an extension

the positron yield becomes appreciable with the laser intensity exceeding
$10^{24}~\rm W/\rm cm^2$, the positrons are obviously polarized. The polarized
positrons can acquire $>30\%$ polarization degree and $>30$ nC charge with a
flux of $10^{12}\,{\rm sr}^{-1}$. The polarization relies on the deflected
angles and can reach 60\% at some angles and energies. The angularly-dependent
polarization is attributed to the asymmetrical laser fields positrons undergo
in the skin layer of overdense plasma, where the radiative spin-flip and
radiation reaction play significant roles. The positron polarization is robust
and could generally appear in future 100-PW-class laser-solid experiments for
various applications.

galaxies and quasars provide important indications of the complex interplay
between the accretion of baryons onto galaxies, the physics that drives the
build-up of stars out of this gas, the subsequent chemical evolution and
feedback processes and the reionisation of the Universe. The Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) continues to play a pivotal role in the
characterisation of the ISM of high-redshift galaxies. Observations of the dust
continuum emission, atomic fine-structure and molecular lines arising from
high-redshift galaxies are now carried out routinely, providing ever more
constraints on the theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution in the
early Universe. The European Astronomical Society's EAS 2021 symposium
dedicated to the exploration of the high-redshift Universe with ALMA provided a
forum for the observational and theoretical high-redshift ALMA communities to
exchange their views and recent results in this rapidly evolving field. The
article summarises the exciting results that were presented at the meeting.

versatile design platform for biocompatible viscoelastic materials. Their
linear response to a step strain displays a fast, near-exponential relaxation
when using low valence crosslinkers, while larger supramolecular crosslinkers
bring about much slower dynamics involving a wide distribution of time scales
whose physical origin is still debated. Here, we propose a model where the
relaxation of polymer gels in the dilute regime originate from elementary
events in which the bonds connecting two neighboring crosslinkers all
disconnect. Larger crosslinkers allow for a greater average number of bonds
connecting them, but also generate more heterogeneity. We characterize the
resulting distribution of relaxation time scales analytically, and accurately
reproduce stress relaxation measurements on metal-coordinated hydrogels with a
variety of crosslinker sizes including ions, metal-organic cages, and
nanoparticles. Our approach is simple enough to be extended to any crosslinker
size and could thus be harnessed for the rational design of complex
viscoelastic materials.

dynamical critical phenomena in the process of the nonlinear accretion of the
scalar field into black holes. The accretion process can transform a seed black
hole into a final scalarized or bald black hole, depending on the initial
parameter of the scalar field $p$. There is a critical parameter $p_{\ast}$ and
near it all intermediate solutions are attracted to a critical solution and
stay there for a time scaling as $T\propto-\gamma\ln|p-p_{\ast}|$. At late
times, the solutions evolve into scalarized black holes if $p>p_{\ast}$, or
bald black holes if $p<p_{\ast}$. The final masses of the resulting
scalarized/bald black holes satisfy power-laws
$M_{p}-M_{\pm}\propto|p-p_{\ast}|^{\gamma_{\pm}}$ where $M_{\pm}$ are the

  Multipliers","25 Pages",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the robust stability of a discrete-time Lurye system
consisting of the feedback interconnection between a linear system and a
bounded and monotone nonlinearity. It has been conjectured that the existence
of a suitable linear time-invariant (LTI) O'Shea-Zames-Falb multiplier is not
only sufficient but also necessary. Roughly speaking, a successful proof of the
conjecture would require: (a) a conic parameterization of a set of multipliers
that describes exactly the set of nonlinearities, (b) a lossless S-procedure to
show that the non-existence of a multiplier implies that the Lurye system is
not uniformly robustly stable over the set of nonlinearities, and (c) the
existence of a multiplier in the set of multipliers used in (a) implies the
existence of an LTI multiplier. We investigate these three steps, showing the
current bottlenecks for proving this conjecture. In addition, we provide an
extension of the class of multipliers which may be used to disprove the
conjecture.

  Forecasting",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has attracted much attention in
many intelligent applications. It is not a trivial task, as we need to consider
both intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies. However,
existing works are designed for specific scenarios, and require much domain
knowledge and expert efforts, which is difficult to transfer between different
scenarios. In this paper, we propose a scale-aware neural architecture search
framework for MTS forecasting (SNAS4MTF). A multi-scale decomposition module
transforms raw time series into multi-scale sub-series, which can preserve
multi-scale temporal patterns. An adaptive graph learning module infers the
different inter-variable dependencies under different time scales without any
prior knowledge. For MTS forecasting, a search space is designed to capture
both intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies at each time
scale. The multi-scale decomposition, adaptive graph learning, and neural
architecture search modules are jointly learned in an end-to-end framework.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SNAS4MTF
achieves a promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

complexity in the number of variables. In this paper, we present an alternative
network layer architecture based on the alternating direction method of

large number of variables. Backward differentiation is performed by implicit

Simulated results demonstrate the computational advantage of the ADMM layer,
which for medium scaled problems is approximately an order of magnitude faster
than the OptNet quadratic programming layer. Furthermore, our novel
backward-pass routine is efficient, from both a memory and computation

Galactic SN rate on the order of ~3x10^-7/yr to ~2x10^-6/yr, three orders of
magnitude below the inferred Galactic SN Ia rate and two orders of magnitude
below the formation rate of predicted He-donor progenitors. The number of
currently observed population members suggests that the He-donor scenariois not
a dominant contributor to the number of observed SNe Ia. However, we find that,
even at the low event rate suggested, the majority of possibly detectable
population members is still undetected. The extreme nature of current
population members suggests that a still larger number of objects has simply
evaded detection up to this point, hinting at a higher contribution than is

higher energy, boron phosphide (BP) holds promise as an unconventional p-type
transparent conductor. Previous experimental reports deal almost exclusively
with epitaxial, nominally undoped BP films by chemical vapor deposition. High
hole concentrations were often observed, but it is unclear if native defects
alone can be responsible for it. Besides, the feasibility of alternative
deposition techniques has not been clarified and optical characterization is
generally lacking. In this work, we demonstrate reactive sputtering of
amorphous BP films, their partial crystallization in a P-containing annealing
atmosphere, and extrinsic doping by C and Si. We obtain the highest hole
concentration reported to date for p-type BP ($5 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$)
using C doping under B-rich conditions. We also confirm that bipolar doping is
possible in BP. An anneal temperature of at least 1000 $^\circ$C is necessary
for crystallization and dopant activation. Hole mobilities are low and indirect
optical transitions are much stronger than predicted by theory. Low crystalline

However, labelling data is difficult and there often are diverse valid beliefs
about what the correct data labels should be. So far, dataset creators have
acknowledged annotator subjectivity, but rarely actively managed it in the
annotation process. This has led to partly-subjective datasets that fail to
serve a clear downstream use. To address this issue, we propose two contrasting
paradigms for data annotation. The descriptive paradigm encourages annotator
subjectivity, whereas the prescriptive paradigm discourages it. Descriptive
annotation allows for the surveying and modelling of different beliefs, whereas
prescriptive annotation enables the training of models that consistently apply
one belief. We discuss benefits and challenges in implementing both paradigms,
and argue that dataset creators should explicitly aim for one or the other to
facilitate the intended use of their dataset. Lastly, we conduct an annotation
experiment using hate speech data that illustrates the contrast between the two
paradigms.

gravitational potential of the supermassive black hole. They can be studied
with unique precision, beyond the confusion limit of a single telescope, with
the near-infrared interferometer GRAVITY. Imaging is essential to search the
field for faint, unknown stars on short orbits which potentially could
constrain the black hole spin. Furthermore, it provides the starting point for
astrometric fitting to derive highly accurate stellar positions. Here, we
present $\mathrm{G^R}$, a new imaging tool specifically designed for Galactic
Center observations with GRAVITY. The algorithm is based on a Bayesian
interpretation of the imaging problem, formulated in the framework of
information field theory and building upon existing works in
radio-interferometric imaging. Its application to GRAVITY observations from
2021 yields the deepest images to date of the Galactic Center on scales of a
few milliarcseconds. The images reveal the complicated source structure within
the central $100\,\mathrm{mas}$ around Sgr A*, where we detected the stars S29
and S55 and confirm S62 on its trajectory, slowly approaching Sgr A*.
Furthermore, we were able to detect S38, S42, S60, and S63 in a series of
exposures for which we offset the fiber from Sgr A*. We provide an update on
the orbits of all aforementioned stars. In addition to these known sources, the
images also reveal a faint star moving to the west at a high angular velocity.
We cannot find any coincidence with any known source and, thus, we refer to the
new star as S300. From the flux ratio with S29, we estimate its K-band
magnitude as $m_\mathrm{K}\left(\mathrm{S300}\right)\simeq 19.0 - 19.3$. Images

seven hard spheres, organized to resemble Y shaped molecule. The antibody has
two Fab and one Fc domains located in the corners of letter Y. In this

effective. The confinement is formed by the randomly distributed hard-spheres
fixed in space. The spherical obstacles, besides the size exclusion, also
interact by the Yukawa attractive interaction with with each bead of the
antibody molecule. We applied the combination of the scaled-particle theory,
Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory and the Flory-Stockmayer theory to
calculate: (i) the liquid-liquid phase separation, and (ii) the percolation
threshold. All these quantities were calculated as functions of the strength of
the attraction between the monoclonal antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies and
obstacles. The conclusion is that while the hard-sphere obstacles decrease the
critical density as also, the critical temperature of the mAbs fluid, the
effect of the protein-obstacle attraction is more complex. Adding the
attraction to obstacle-mAbs interaction first increases the wideness of the
temperature-density envelope. However, with the further increase of the
obstacle-mAbs attraction intensity we observe reversal of the effect, the
temperature-density curves become narrower. At some point, depending on the
AC=BC interaction, the situation is observed where two different temperatures
have the same fluid density (reentry point ). In all the cases shown here the
critical point decreases below the value for the neat fluid, but the behaviour
with respect to increase of the strength of obstacle-mAbs attraction is not

purpose of the calculations is to reveal the possibility of using the

energy. Another important characteristic is the divergence radius of the
electron beam at a predetermined distance from the film, or the electron
scattering angle. As a result of calculations, the energy spectra of
bremsstrahlung gamma-quanta, formed during the passage of electrons through the
materials of the films, are obtained. The most probable values of the energy
absorbed in the Ti foil and in the Kapton$^\circledR$ film are calculated. The
scattering radii of an electron beam for the Kapton$^\circledR$ film and also
for the Ti foil at a distance of 20 cm are estimated. It is shown that the
ratio of the total amount of bremsstrahlung gamma quanta in the case of use the

bremsstrahlung gamma quanta when using the Ti foil. The analysis of the
calculated data showed that the use of Kapton$^\circledR$ as a material for the
manufacture of output devices for high-energy electron beams is more preferable

possible to significantly reduce the background of the generated bremsstrahlung

through a series of calibration processes, some faint transient signals of yet
unexplained origin remain in the measurements. If they appear in the LISA data,
these perturbations (also called glitches) could skew the characterization of

For the first time, we provide a comprehensive census of LPF transient events.
Our analysis is based on a phenomenological shapelet model allowing us to
derive simple statistics about the physical features of the glitch population.

sources are mostly created independently, being a significant challenge to
their integration. Mapping languages, e.g., RML and R2RML, facilitate
declarative specification of the process of applying meta-data and integrating
data into a knowledge graph. Mapping rules can also include knowledge
extraction functions in addition to expressing correspondences among data
sources and a unified schema. Combining mapping rules and functions represents
a powerful formalism to specify pipelines for integrating data into a knowledge
graph transparently. Surprisingly, these formalisms are not fully adapted, and
many knowledge graphs are created by executing ad-hoc programs to pre-process
and integrate data. In this paper, we present EABlock, an approach integrating
Entity Alignment (EA) as part of RML mapping rules. EABlock includes a block of
functions performing entity recognition from textual attributes and link the
recognized entities to the corresponding resources in Wikidata, DBpedia, and
domain specific thesaurus, e.g., UMLS. EABlock provides agnostic and efficient
techniques to evaluate the functions and transfer the mappings to facilitate
its application in any RML-compliant engine. We have empirically evaluated
EABlock performance, and results indicate that EABlock speeds up knowledge

A famous theorem of Fermat says that these primes are exactly the ones that can

equidistributed is a beautiful theorem of Duke, Friedlander and Iwaniec from
1995. We show that a subsequence of the roots of the equation remains
equidistributed even when one adds a restriction on the primes which has to do
with the angle in the plane formed by their corresponding representation as a
sum of squares.
  Similar to Duke, Friedlander and Iwaniec, we reduce the problem to the study
of certain Poincare series, however, while their Poincare series were functions
on an arithmetic quotient of the upper half plane, our Poincare series are
functions on arithmetic quotients of $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$, as they have a
nontrivial dependence on their Iwasawa $\theta$-coordinate. Spectral analysis
on these higher dimensional varieties involves the nonspherical spectrum, which

energy dissipation induced by switching electronic signal lines presents a
fundamental challenge for truly 3D electronic integration. Photonics reduces
this problem, and direct laser writing of a photoresin is a promising
high-resolution tool for 3D photonic integration. Here, we combine one and
two-photon polymerization (TPP) for waveguide integration for the first time,
dramatically accelerating the fabrication process and increasing optical
confinement. 3D additive printing is based on femtosecond TPP, while blanket
irradiation with a UV lamp induces one-photon polymerization (OPP) throughout
the entire 3D chip. We locally and dynamically adjust writing conditions to
implement (3+1)D \emph{flash}-TPP: waveguide cores are printed with a small
distance between neighboring writing voxels to ensure smooth interfaces,
mechanical support structures are printed at maximal distance between the
voxels to speed up the process. Finally, the entire chip's \emph{passive}
volume not part of waveguide cores or mechanical support is polymerized in a
single instance by UV blanket irradiation. This decouples fabrication time from
the passive volume's size. We succeed in printing vertical single-mode
waveguides of 6~mm length that reach up to NA = 0.16. Noteworthy, we achieve
exceptionally low -0.26 dB injection and very low propagation losses of -1.36
dB/mm, which is within one order of magnitude of standard integrated silicon
photonics. Finally, the optical performance of our waveguides does not
deteriorate during 120 days within our measurement uncertainty.

features of the oral fluid actively affect the mechanisms of transmission of
infection by airborne droplets. In this work, the oral fluid was studied both
from the point of view of a participant in the transmission of infection and as
a model for studying the rheology of viscoelastic fluids. The method is based
on video recording of the stretching of a drop of the test liquid between the
legs of the tweezers and the subsequent spontaneous thinning of the formed
capillary filament of the liquid. The process is controlled by the competition
of forces of inertia, elasticity, capillarity. By analyzing the video
recording, it is possible to trace the contribution of each factor and, within
the framework of the Oldroyd/Maxwell rheological constitutive equation

obtained rheological characteristics of the oral fluid make it possible to
theoretically model the processes of the formation of drops of oral fluid

Programs allow human engineers to express sub-goals and complex task scenarios

design, however, is that while humans can provide the high-level structures,
properly setting the low-level details, such as the right amount of reward for

probabilistic framework that can infer the best candidate programmatic reward
function from expert demonstrations. Inspired by recent generative-adversarial
approaches, our framework searches for the most likely programmatic reward
function under which the optimally generated trajectories cannot be
differentiated from the demonstrated trajectories. Experimental results show
that programmatic reward functionslearned using this framework can
significantly outperform those learned using existing reward learning

Here, we propose to physically rescale the inputs and outputs of machine

offline parameterizations of subgrid-scale thermodynamics in three distinct

make accurate predictions in test climates that are 4K and 8K warmer than their

incorporating physical knowledge into data-driven models of Earth system
processes can improve their consistency and ability to generalize across

area that can improve the trustworthiness of these models by giving

interpret the results of the DL model, the autoencoder in this case. And, based
on the interpretation, we improved its performance for computer network anomaly
detection. The kernel SHAP method, which is based on the shapley values, is
used as a novel feature selection technique. This method is used to identify
only those features that are actually causing the anomalous behaviour of the

plasma, a picosecond laser was utilized to ablate a pure copper plate to
generate a plasma spectrum. Following numerous experiments on the subject,
three significant factors have been determined: lens focal length, pulse energy
and the lens-to-sample distance. These factors were employed to analyze the
spectral intensity, plasma temperature and electron density in the local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and optically thin condition. Due to the
shielding effects of mixed plasma, the strongest spectral intensity can be
obtained in the pre-focused case rather than on the focus, no matter how much
beam irradiance was employed. The more intensive the beam irradiance is, the
more the optimal position is distant from the focal point. Similarly, the
evolution of plasma temperature and electron density was shown a peak in the
pre-focused case, which is consistent with the trend of spectral intensity. For
the case of extremely high irradiance (on the focus), the shielding effects
become more apparent and the resultant above three factors decreased sharply.
When a longer-focal-length lens was employed, the spectral intensity exhibited
an obvious bimodal trend. In the pre-focused case, a longer-focal-length lens
is helpful to eliminate the effects of the roughness of the target surface
compared with a shorter one. Finally, the assumed LTE was validated by
McWhirter relation, plasma relaxation time and diffusion length, and the
optically thin condition also validated by spectral intensity ratio. We hope
this work could be an important reference for the future design of highly
optimized experiments for Calibration-Free Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy
(CF-LIBS).

observation, the present papers proposes a method to both analyze and visualize
a strain measure during a duty cycle of uniaxial tension-torsion in large
strain: based on the mathematical properties of the Hencky strain tensor
$\mathbf{h}$, the method consists in projecting $\mathbf{h}$ onto a well-chosen
tensorial basis, whose constituting elements are described in terms of physical
meaning. Thanks to this decomposition, the history of $\mathbf{h}$ reduces to
the time evolution of a 3-components vector $\alpha(t)$. This vector history
can then be visualized as a path in the 3D space, rendering very visual the
complex kinematic phenomenon. As a second result, an original definition of the
mean and the amplitude of a strain path, based on the theory of the Minimum
Circumscribed Spheres, is proposed. This definition could be useful for fatigue
studies, for instance.

in EEG emotion recognition, we can observe that clearer boundaries exist
between coarse-grained emotions than those between fine-grained emotions, based
on the same EEG data; this indicates the concurrence of large coarse- and small
fine-grained emotion variations. Thus, the progressive classification process
from coarse- to fine-grained categories may be helpful for EEG emotion
recognition. Consequently, in this study, we propose a progressive graph
convolution network (PGCN) for capturing this inherent characteristic in EEG
emotional signals and progressively learning the discriminative EEG features.
To fit different EEG patterns, we constructed a dual-graph module to
characterize the intrinsic relationship between different EEG channels,
containing the dynamic functional connections and static spatial proximity
information of brain regions from neuroscience research. Moreover, motivated by
the observation of the relationship between coarse- and fine-grained emotions,
we adopt a dual-head module that enables the PGCN to progressively learn more

categories (difficult), referring to the hierarchical characteristic of
emotion. To verify the performance of our model, extensive experiments were

mounted on nodes that may have energy consumption restrictions if they are

and we study the existing trade-offs between the sampling of such sensors, the
quality of the sensor calibration, and the power consumption involved. To this
end, we conduct experiments on prototype nodes measuring tropospheric ozone,
nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen monoxide at high frequency. The results show
that the sensor sampling strategy directly affects the quality of the air

sampling strategies. In addition, duty cycles of 0.1 can be achieved when the
sensors have response times in the order of two minutes, and duty cycles
between 0.01 and 0.02 can be achieved when the sensor response times are
negligible, calibrating with hourly reference values and maintaining a quality

are investigated. This motion is simulated on the basis of the Holstein model.
Earlier studies demonstrate a possibility of a uniform motion of a charge in a
constant electric field over very long distances. For small values of the
electric field intensity a Holstein polaron can move at a constant velocity. As
the electric field intensity increases, a charge motion acquires oscillatorily
character, performing Bloch oscillations. Since the charge motion depends on
the whole set of the system parameters the character of the motion depends not
only on the value of the electric field intensity. Therefore, the electric
field intensity for which the uniform motion takes place differs for chains
with different parameters. The character of the charge motion and distribution
is considered in chains with different values of the constant of coupling
between the charge and the displacements of the chain. It is shown that the
values of the electric field intensity for which the regime of a charge motion
changes are different in chains with different values of the coupling constant.
It is also demonstrated that for one and the same value of the electric field
intensity, in chains with different values of the coupling constant either a
uniform motion or an oscillatory motion, or a stationary polaron can be
observed.

negative specific thermal capacity. We assume that the molar thermal capacity
of the reported metamaterial is governed by the Dulong-Petit law in its high
temperature limit. The specific thermal capacity depends on the density of the
metamaterial; thus, it is expected to be negative, when the effective density
of the chain is negative. The range of the frequencies enabling the effect of
the negative thermal capacity is established. Dependence of the effective
thermal capacity on the exciting frequency for various core/shell mass ratios
is elucidated. The effective thermal capacity becomes negative in the vicinity
of the local resonance frequency {\omega}_0 in the situation when the frequency
{\omega} approaches {\omega}_0 from above. The effect of the negative effective
thermal capacity is expected in metals in the vicinity of the plasma frequency.
The effect of the viscous dissipation on the effective thermal capacity is
addressed.

data rate requirements of V2X services demanded by connected and automated
vehicles (CAVs). MmWave V2X technologies will leverage directional antennas
that challenge the management of the communications in dynamic scenarios
including the identification of available links, beams alignment, and
scheduling. Previous studies have shown that these challenges can be reduced
when mmWave communications are supported by side information like the one
transmitted in sub-6GHz V2X technologies. In this context, this paper proposes
a beamwidth-aware mmWave scheduling scheme for V2V communications supported by
sub-6GHz V2X technologies. The proposal enables mmWave transmitters to schedule
a mmWave transmission to several neighboring vehicles at the same time by
adapting the beamwidth configuration. In addition, the proposal derives the
minimum beamwidth that mmWave transmitters should use to contact their
neighboring vehicles in a limited number of scheduling intervals. The obtained
results demonstrate that the proposal helps increasing the amount of mmWave
data that can be transmitted to neighboring vehicles.

calculate the electron emission yield for metal surfaces at very low electron
impact energies. Solving the embedding equation within a quasi-isotropic
approximation and using the effective mass model for the solid, experimental
data are fairly well reproduced provided (i) incoherent scattering on ion cores
is allowed to contribute to the scattering cascades inside the solid and (ii)
the transmission through the surface potential takes into account Bragg gaps
due to coherent scattering on crystal planes parallel to the surface as well as
randomization of the electron's lateral momentum due to elastic scattering on
surface defects. Our results suggest that in order to get secondary electrons
out of metals, the large energy loss due to inelastic electron-electron
scattering has to be compensated for by incoherent elastic electron-ion core
scattering, irrespective of the crystallinity of the sample.

welding processes lies in characterising the complex melt-pool behaviour which
exhibits highly non-linear responses to variations of process parameters. The
present work presents a simulation-based approach to describe the melt-pool
behaviour in root-pass gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Three-dimensional
numerical simulations have been performed using an enhanced physics-based
computational model to unravel the effect of groove shape on complex unsteady
heat and fluid flow in GMAW. The influence of surface deformations on
power-density distribution and the forces applied to the molten material was
taken into account. Utilising this model, the complex heat and fluid flow in
melt pools were visualised and described for different groove shapes.
Additionally, experiments were performed to validate the numerical predictions
and the robustness of the present computational model is demonstrated. The
model can be used to explore physical effects of governing fluid flow and
melt-pool stability during gas metal arc root welding.

Verifying the protection of confidential information such as social security

program verifies that developers do not leave vulnerabilities in their
applications. The program aids the developer by identifying cryptographic
misuses such as hard-coded keys, weak program hashes, and using insecure
protocols. In my Master's thesis work, I made several important contributions
to improving the deployability, accessibility, and usability of CryptoGuard. I
extended CryptoGuard to scan source and compiled code, created live
documentation, and supported a dual cloud and local tool-suite. I also created
build tool plugins and a program aid for CryptoGuard. In addition, I also
analyzed several Java-related surveys encompassing more than 50,000 developers
and reported interesting current practices of real-world software developers.

do not cover bulk email and paid services can be costly and are not easy to
customize. Traditional email client used for basic emailing services fail to be
useful in larger volumes of emails to target people or spread information to
consented individuals. This paper proposes a serverless architecture to tackle
such problems by using one such offering from the Amazon Web Services(AWS) API
which can be easily replaced by a software architects choice of service. The
constraints help to make an architecture using components that can fit most of
the needs of a serverless backend and extend it to scenarios such mobile
notifications, One Time Password (OTP) systems or other means of communication
to minimize single point of failure and also decrease the dependency on
physical servers for such operations offering a comparable solution within the
cloud. The architecture proposed is tested to find the time taken to send the
emails of various quantities and see how it affects the cost. The architecture
was successful able to send multiple emails in a quick and single invocation
and has demonstrated a higher level of scalability compared to conventional
methods.
