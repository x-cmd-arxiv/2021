properties of conventional materials in nature. Metamaterials allow the
creation of negative refractive indexes, light trapping with epsilon-near-zero
compounds, bandgap selection, superconductivity phenomena, non-Hermitian
responses and, more generally, to manipulate the propagation of electromagnetic
and acoustic waves. In the past, low computational resources and the lack of
proper manufacturing techniques have limited the attention to 1-D and 2-D
metamaterials. However, the true potential of metamaterials will be ultimately
reached in 3-D configurations, when the degrees of freedom associated to the
propagating direction are finally exploited in design. This is expected to lead
to a new era in metamaterial field, from which future high-speed and
low-latency communication networks can benefit. Here, a comprehensive overview
of the past, present and future trends related to 3-D metamaterial devices is
presented, focusing on efficient computational methods, innovative designs and
functional manufacturing techniques.

interface using the theories of phononic and radiative friction and heat
transfer are presented. The phononic contributions to friction and heat
transfer are many orders of magnitude larger than the radiative contributions.
Phononic friction and heat transfer slightly increase with an increase in the
number of graphene layers $N$ and reach saturation at $N>5$, which is
associated with an increase in the phonon transmission coefficient through the
interface and a finite phonon mean free path in the direction perpendicular to
the surface. The radiative contributions are almost independent on $N$, since
for distance between water and graphene of the order of the interlayer distance
in graphene the interaction of evanescent waves with multilayer graphene is
limited by the first graphene layer. The results for the phonon contributions
agree with the results obtained for the Kapitsa resistance using MD simulation
and with the experimental data obtained for the friction coefficients at the
water-monolayer graphene interface. The potential difference leads to a strong
increase in the radiative contributions to friction and heat transfer, which
become approximately an order of magnitude greater than the phononic
contributions at a potential difference of $\sim 10$V.

in small-scale recommendation scenarios is more challenging due to the severe
Data Distribution Fluctuation (DDF) issue. DDF prevents existing CVR models
from being effective since 1) several months of data are needed to train CVR
models sufficiently in small scenarios, leading to considerable distribution
discrepancy between training and online serving; and 2) e-commerce promotions
have significant impacts on small scenarios, leading to distribution
uncertainty of the upcoming time period. In this work, we propose a novel CVR
method named MetaCVR from a perspective of meta learning to address the DDF
issue. Firstly, a base CVR model which consists of a Feature Representation
Network (FRN) and output layers is designed and trained sufficiently with
samples across months. Then we treat time periods with different data
distributions as different occasions and obtain positive and negative
prototypes for each occasion using the corresponding samples and the
pre-trained FRN. Subsequently, a Distance Metric Network (DMN) is devised to
calculate the distance metrics between each sample and all prototypes to
facilitate mitigating the distribution uncertainty. At last, we develop an
Ensemble Prediction Network (EPN) which incorporates the output of FRN and DMN
to make the final CVR prediction. In this stage, we freeze the FRN and train
the DMN and EPN with samples from recent time period, therefore effectively
easing the distribution discrepancy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of CVR prediction targeting the DDF issue in small-scale
recommendation scenarios. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate
the superiority of our MetaCVR and online A/B test also shows our model
achieves impressive gains of 11.92% on PCVR and 8.64% on GMV.

($\kappa$) in a novel fivefold twinned diamond nanowires (5FT-DNWs). The
$\kappa$ of 5FT-DNWs is effectively enhanced by the defects of 5FT boundaries,
and non-monotonically changes with the cross-sectional area ($\textit{S}$).
Above the critical $\textit{S}$ = 7.1 nm$^{2}$, 5FT-DNWs show a constant value

decreasing $\textit{S}$. More importantly, 5FT-DNWs with minimal $\textit{S}$
show a superior $\kappa$ over the bulk diamond. By confirming the
Normal-process-dominated scattering event, it is demonstrated that the phonon
hydrodynamic behavior plays a determinative role in abnormally high $\kappa$ of

find the safest routes for individuals and groups by considering both a fixed

datasets show that our approach finds the safest route in seconds. Compared to
the direct algorithm, our iterative algorithm requires 47% less exposure of

minimizing the distance between a spin-j thermal state and the evolved state of

Moreover, we demonstrate that the qualitative behavior of the distance-based
local temperature is independent of the choice of the distance measure by
comparing the trace distance, Uhlmann's fidelity and relative entropy distance.
We further observe by computing local master equation that the quantum
refrigerator consisting of a spin-1/2 and a spin-j particle can lead to a lower
local temperature compared to a refrigerator with two identical spin-j

point for the construction of many tidal theories such as Darwinian tidal
theories or the hydrodynamical Creep tide theory. This paper presents the
ellipsoidal equilibrium figure when the spin rate vector of the deformed body
is not perpendicular to the plane of motion of the companion. We obtain the
equatorial and the polar flattenings as functions of the Jeans and the
Maclaurin flattenings, and of the angle $\theta$ between the spin rate vector
and the radius vector. The equatorial vertex of the equilibrium ellipsoid does
not point toward the companion, which produces a torque perpendicular to the
rotation vector, which introduces terms of precession and nutation. We find
that the direction of spin may differ significantly from the direction of the
principal axis of inertia $C$, so the classical approximation
$\mathsf{I}\vec{\omega}\approx C\vec{\omega}$ only makes sense in the
neighborhood of the planar problem. We also study the so-called Cassini states.
Neglecting the short-period terms in the differential equation for the spin
direction and assuming a uniform precession of the line of the orbital
ascending node, we obtain the same differential equation as that found by
Colombo (1966). That is, a tidally deformed inviscid body has exactly the same
Cassini states as a rotating axisymmetric rigid body, the tidal bulge having no

obtain how the transfer efficiency increases with increasing absolute value of
the Fano factor. The present work is expected to find application in areas
where the population transfer between two bound states through a continuum
structure plays an important role, for example coherence effects, like
population trapping and electromagnetically induced transparency, optical
analogs for light waves propagating in waveguide-based photonic structures, and
qubits coupled via a continuum of bosonic or waveguide modes.

neutron-rich nuclei. The LEE was shown to be a feature of the magnetic dipole

in medium-mass nuclei. However, its existence in heavy nuclei and its evolution
with neutron number remain open questions. Here, using a combination of
many-body methods, we find the LEE in the $M1$ $\gamma$SFs of heavy samarium
nuclei. In particular, we use the static-path plus random-phase approximation
(SPA+RPA), which includes static and small-amplitude quantal fluctuations

roughly independent of the average initial energy over a wide range below the
neutron separation energy. As the neutron number increases, strength transfers
to a low-energy excitation, which we interpret as the scissors mode built on

investigated for the regenerative repair of cartilage defects. Low-intensity
pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has the potential to promote chondrogenic
differentiation of MSCs. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear.
Here, we investigated the promoting effects and mechanisms underlying LIPUS
stimulation on the chondrogenic differentiation of human umbilical cord
mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) and further evaluated its regenerative
application value in articular cartilage defects in rats.
  Methods: LIPUS was applied to stimulate cultured hUC-MSCs and C28/I2 cells in
vitro. Immunofluorescence staining, qPCR analysis, and transcriptome sequencing
were used to detect mature cartilage-related markers of gene and protein
expression for a comprehensive evaluation of differentiation. Injured articular
cartilage rat models were established for further hUC-MSC transplantation and
LIPUS stimulation in vivo. Histopathology and H&E staining were used to
evaluate the repair effects of the injured articular cartilage with LIPUS
stimulation.
  Results: The results showed that LIPUS stimulation with specific parameters
effectively promoted the expression of mature cartilage-related genes and
proteins, inhibited TNF-{\alpha} gene expression in hUC-MSCs, and exhibited
anti-inflammation in C28/I2 cells. In addition, the articular cartilage defects
of rats were significantly repaired after hUC-MSC transplantation and LIPUS
stimulation.
  Conclusions: Taken together, LIPUS stimulation could realize articular
cartilage regeneration based on hUC-MSC transplantation due to the inhibition
of the TNF signaling pathway, which is of clinical value for the relief of
osteoarthritis.

machine learning applications, e.g., medical diagnosis. Although many recent
transformer extensions have been proposed, the study of the uncertainty
estimation of transformer models is under-explored. In this work, we propose a
novel way to enable transformers to have the capability of uncertainty
estimation and, meanwhile, retain the original predictive performance. This is
achieved by learning a hierarchical stochastic self-attention that attends to
values and a set of learnable centroids, respectively. Then new attention heads
are formed with a mixture of sampled centroids using the Gumbel-Softmax trick.
We theoretically show that the self-attention approximation by sampling from a
Gumbel distribution is upper bounded. We empirically evaluate our model on two
text classification tasks with both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD)
datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach: (1) achieves
the best predictive performance and uncertainty trade-off among compared
methods; (2) exhibits very competitive (in most cases, improved) predictive
performance on ID datasets; (3) is on par with Monte Carlo dropout and ensemble
methods in uncertainty estimation on OOD datasets.

The approach is tested on simulated and measured single family home datasets.
We show that the novel algorithm performs better compared to commonly used

assigning patterns correctly. Additionally, the methodology can be used to
identify outliers within clusters of demand patterns. Furthermore, this study
investigates which socio-economic characteristics (e.g. employment status,
number of residents) are prevalent within single clusters and, consequently,
can be linked to the shape of the cluster's barycenters. In future, the
proposed methods in combination with stochastic demand models can be used to
fill data-gaps in hydraulic models.

the rising trend of their far-infrared-to-sub-millimeter spectral energy
distributions and the fact that they are radio-weak. Their precise positions
are available through millimeter and/or radio interferometry, which enable us
to search for their counterparts in the deep optical-to-near-IR images. The
sample include five z > 6 candidates. Three of them have their counterparts
identified, one is still invisible in the deepest images, and one is a known
galaxy at z = 5.667 that is completely blocked by a foreground galaxy. The
three with counterparts identified are analyzed using population systhesis
model, and they have photometric redshift solutions ranging from 7.5 to 9.0.
Assuming that they are indeed at these redshifts and that they are not
gravitationally lensed, their total IR luminosities are 10^{13.8-14.1} L_sun
and the inferred star formation rates are 6.3--13 x 10^3 M_sun/yr. The
existence of dusty starbursts at such redshifts would imply that the universe
must be forming stars intensely very early in time in at least some galaxies,
otherwise there would not be enough dust to produce the descendants observed at
these redshifts. The inferred host galaxy stellar masses of these three
objects, which are at >~ 10^{11} M_sun (if not affected by gravitational
lensing), present a difficulty in explanation unless we are willing to accept
that their progenitors either kept forming stars at a rate of >~ 10^3 M_sun/yr

index and wavelength, the number of required evaluations for the expected
scattering increases dramatically. In the case of dielectric and weakly
absorbing spherical particles (both homogeneous and layered), we begin with a
Fraunhofer approximation of the scattering coefficients consisting of
Riccati-Bessel functions, and reduce it into simpler nested trigonometric
approximations. They provide further computational advantages when
parameterized on lines of constant optical path lengths. This can reduce the
cost of evaluations by large factors $\approx$ 50, without a loss of accuracy
in the integrals of these scattering coefficients. We analyze the errors of the
proposed approximation, and present numerical results for a set of forward
problems as a demonstration.

  Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface","17 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory. Comments are most welcome and appreciated",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper investigates the information theoretical limit of a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) aided communication scenario in which the RIS and the
transmitter either jointly or independently send information to the receiver.
The RIS is an emerging technology that uses a large number of passive
reflective elements with adjustable phases to intelligently reflect the
transmit signal to the intended receiver. While most previous studies of the
RIS focus on its ability to beamform and to boost the received signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), this paper shows that if the information data stream is also
available at the RIS and can be modulated through the adjustable phases at the
RIS, significant improvement in the {degree-of-freedom} (DoF) of the overall
channel is possible. For example, for an RIS system in which the signals are
reflected from a transmitter with $M$ antennas to a receiver with $K$ antennas
through an RIS with $N$ reflective elements, assuming no direct path between
the transmitter and the receiver, joint transmission of the transmitter and the
RIS can achieve a DoF of $\min(M+\frac{N}{2}-\frac{1}{2},N,K)$ as compared to
the DoF of $\min(M,K)$ for the conventional multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) channel. This result is obtained by establishing a connection between
the RIS system and the MIMO channel with phase noises and by using results for
characterizing the information dimension under projection. The result is
further extended to the case with a direct path between the transmitter and the
receiver, and also to the multiple access scenario, in which the transmitter
and the RIS send independent information. Finally, this paper proposes a
symbol-level precoding approach for modulating data through the phases of the
RIS, and provides numerical simulation results to verify the theoretical DoF
results.

(PINNs) is adapted to study steady groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers.
This technique utilizes information from underlying physics represented in the
form of partial differential equations (PDEs) alongside data obtained from
physical observations. In this work, we consider the Dupuit-Boussinesq
equation, which is based on the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation, as well as a
recent more complete model derived by Di Nucci (2018) as underlying models. We
then train PINNs on data obtained from steady-state analytical solutions and
laboratory based experiments.
  Using PINNs, we predict phreatic surface profiles given different input flow
conditions and recover estimates for the hydraulic conductivity from the
experimental observations. We show that PINNs can eliminate the inherent
inability of the Dupuit-Boussinesq equation to predict flows with seepage
faces. Moreover, the inclusion of physics information from the Di Nucci and
Dupuit-Boussinesq models constrains the solution space and produces better
predictions than solely the training data. PINNs based predictions are very
robust and show little effect from added noise in the training data. Further,
we compare the PINNs obtained using the two different flow models to examine
the effects of higher order flow terms, which are neglected by the Dupuit
Forchheimer approximation. We found a dimensionless parameter $\Pi$, which is
the ratio of vertical to horizontal flow effects. For $\Pi \leq 0.1$,
Dupuit-Boussinesq approximation is found to be applicable but not otherwise.
Lastly, we discuss the effectiveness of using PINNs for examining groundwater

an incommensurate potential. The quadratic band touching is stable until the
system undergoes an Anderson like delocalization transition in momentum space,
which occurs concomitantly with a strongly renormalized single particle
spectrum inducing flat bands, which is a generalization of the magic-angle
condition realized in Dirac semimetals. The band structure is described
perturbatively in the quasiperiodic potential strength, which captures miniband
formation and the existence of magic-angles that qualitatively agrees with the
exact numerical results in the appropriate regime. We identify several
magic-angle conditions that can either have part or all of the quadratic band

components that often demoralizes students with its ineffectiveness and
inefficiency is vocabulary acquisition, or more simply put, memorizing words.
In light of such, a personalized and educational vocabulary recommendation
system that traces a learner's vocabulary knowledge state would have an immense
learning impact as it could resolve both issues. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose and release data for a novel task called Pedagogical Word
Recommendation (PWR). The main goal of PWR is to predict whether a given
learner knows a given word based on other words the learner has already seen.
To elaborate, we collect this data via an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS)
that is serviced to ~1M L2 learners who study for the standardized English
exam, TOEIC. As a feature of this ITS, students can directly indicate words
they do not know from the questions they solved to create wordbooks. Finally,
we report the evaluation results of a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach
along with an exploratory data analysis and discuss the impact and efficacy of
this dataset as a baseline for future studies on this task.

commonly adopted assumption is the local smoothness assumption on foreground

morphology and size characteristics to determine age-adequate brain maturity,
this requires years of experience in pediatric neuroradiology. With no
standardized criteria, visual estimation of the structural maturity of the
brain from MRI before three years of age remains dominated by inter-observer

naturally hard to obtain, and the observer ground truth not much of a gold
standard due to subjectivity of assessment. In this light, we explore the

algorithms exist for the GTRS, their relatively large computational complexity
has motivated and spurred the development of custom approaches for solving the

paper we develop algorithms for computing $\epsilon$-approximate solutions to
the GTRS whose running times are linear in both the input sparsity and the
precision $\log(1/\epsilon)$ whenever a regularity parameter is positive. We
complement our theoretical guarantees with numerical experiments comparing our
approach against algorithms from the literature. Our numerical experiments

data values, but with knowledge of data collection methods was recently
introduced by Chen, Valiant and Valiant (NeurIPS 2020). In this framework, the
goal is to design estimators that minimize the worst-case expected error. Here
the expectation is over a known, randomized data collection process from some
population, and the data values corresponding to each element of the population
are assumed to be worst-case.
  Chen, Valiant and Valiant show that, when data values are
$\ell_{\infty}$-normalized, there is a polynomial time algorithm to compute an
estimator for the mean with worst-case expected error that is within a factor
$\frac{\pi}{2}$ of the optimum within the natural class of semilinear
estimators. However, their algorithm is based on optimizing a somewhat complex
concave objective function over a constrained set of positive semidefinite
matrices, and thus does not come with explicit runtime guarantees beyond being
polynomial time in the input.
  In this paper we design provably efficient algorithms for approximating the
optimal semilinear estimator based on online convex optimization. In the
setting where data values are $\ell_{\infty}$-normalized, our algorithm
achieves a $\frac{\pi}{2}$-approximation by iteratively solving a sequence of
standard SDPs. When data values are $\ell_2$-normalized, our algorithm
iteratively computes the top eigenvector of a sequence of matrices, and does
not lose any multiplicative approximation factor. We complement these positive
results by stating a simple combinatorial condition which, if satisfied by a
data collection process, implies that any (not necessarily semilinear)
estimator for the mean has constant worst-case expected error.

several key advantages, such as ability to measure and compare less than
perfect MT output from different systems, ability to indicate human perception

manually and difficult to induce from text due to reporting bias (Gordon and
Van Durme, 2013). In this work, we are interested in the scientific question of
whether explicit script knowledge is present and accessible through pre-trained
generative language models (LMs). To this end, we introduce the task of
generating full event sequence descriptions (ESDs) given a scenario in the form
of natural language prompts. In zero-shot probing experiments, we find that
generative LMs produce poor ESDs with mostly omitted, irrelevant, repeated or
misordered events. To address this, we propose a pipeline-based script
induction framework (SIF) which can generate good quality ESDs for unseen
scenarios (e.g., bake a cake). SIF is a two-staged framework that fine-tunes LM
on a small set of ESD examples in the first stage. In the second stage, ESD
generated for an unseen scenario is post-processed using RoBERTa-based models
to filter irrelevant events, remove repetitions, and reorder the temporally
misordered events. Through automatic and manual evaluations, we demonstrate
that SIF yields substantial improvements ($1$-$3$ BLUE points) over a
fine-tuned LM. However, manual analysis shows that there is great room for
improvement, offering a new research direction for inducing script knowledge.

Previous theoretical work highlighted magic angle graphene as a promising FCI
platform, satisfying the twin requirements of flat bands and
lowest-Landau-level-like quantum geometry. Indeed, recent experiments have
demonstrated FCIs in magic angle graphene with weak magnetic fields. Here we
conduct a detailed theoretical study of the most prominent FCI state observed,
and clarify the role of the magnetic field in stabilizing this state. We
introduce two new technical tools: first, we generalize the notion of ideal
quantum geometry to Hofstadter minibands and, second, we extend the
Hartree-Fock theory of magic-angle graphene to finite field, to account for the
interaction generated bandwidth. We show that magnetic field both dramatically
reduces the effective bandwidth and improves the quantum geometry for hosting
FCIs. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of a
microscopic model of magic angle graphene, we establish the regime of bandwidth
and quantum geometry indicators where FCIs are stabilized. Further
characterizing the finite-field bands by the same quantities we show how a
zero-field charge density wave state gives way to an FCI state at a magnetic
flux consistent with experiment. We also speculate on the other FCIs seen in
the same experiments, including anomalous incompressible states and
even-denominator fractions which may host non-Abelian states. Finally, when
bandwidth is the limiting factor, we propose a range of experimental parameters
where FCIs should appear at zero magnetic field.

While this problem has been studied for many years, a recent breakthrough of
Auer et al. (2018, 2019) provides the first adaptive procedure to guarantee an
optimal (dynamic) regret $\sqrt{LT}$, for $T$ rounds, and an unknown number $L$
of changes. However, while this rate is tight in the worst case, it remained
open whether faster rates are possible, without prior knowledge, if few changes
in distribution are actually severe.
  To resolve this question, we propose a new notion of significant shift, which
only counts very severe changes that clearly necessitate a restart: roughly,
these are changes involving not only best arm switches, but also involving
large aggregate differences in reward overtime. Thus, our resulting procedure
adaptively achieves rates always faster (sometimes significantly) than
$O(\sqrt{ST})$, where $S\ll L$ only counts best arm switches, while at the same
time, always faster than the optimal $O(V^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ when
expressed in terms of total variation $V$ (which aggregates differences
overtime). Our results are expressed in enough generality to also capture

approximate large-scale dominating dynamics, which do not resolve the small
scales by design. To resolve this representation barrier, we introduce a new
qualitative characterization of the space-time locations of shocks, named as
the ``shock trace'', via a space-time indicator function based on an empirical
resolution-adaptive threshold. Different from the exact shocks, the shock
traces can be captured within the representation capacity of the large scales,
which facilitates the forecast of the timing and locations of the shocks
utilizing reduced models. Within the context of a viscous stochastic Burgers
equation, we show that a data-driven reduced model, in the form of nonlinear
autoregression (NAR) time series models, can accurately predict the random
shock traces, with relatively low rates of false predictions. The NAR model
significantly outperforms the corresponding Galerkin truncated model in the
scenario of either noiseless or noisy observations. The results illustrate the
importance of the data-driven closure terms in the NAR model, which account for
the effects of the unresolved small scale dynamics on the resolved ones due to

phase, when the infall of matter from the surrounding envelope is substantial,
the star accumulates mass primarily because of envelope-induced gravitational
instability in a protostellar disc. In this phase, we model the envelope mass
accretion rate from the isothermal free-fall collapse of a molecular cloud
core. The disc gains mass from the envelope, and transports matter to the star
via a disc accretion mechanism that includes episodic gravitational instability
and mass accretion bursts according to the Toomre $Q$-criterion. In a later
phase, mass is accreted on to the star due to gravitational torques within the
spiral structures in the disc, in a manner that analytic theory suggests has a
mass accretion rate $\propto t^{-6/5}$. Our model provides a self-consistent
evolution of the mass accretion rate by joining the spherical envelope
accretion (dominant at the earlier stage) with the disc accretion (important at
the later stage), and accounts for the presence of episodic accretion bursts at
appropriate times. We show using a simple example that the burst mode can
provide a good match to the observed distribution of bolometric luminosities.
Our framework reproduces key elements of detailed numerical simulations of disc
accretion and can aid in developing intuition about the basic physics as well

parameter space the effects on the near-horizon regions and black hole shadows
are small, in many parts of the low particle mass regions the effects are
significant, and potentially measurable by current and future telescopes. Such
deviations, for instance, include characteristic changes in the photon sphere
and black hole shadow radii, unique thresholds for the dark matter plasma
dispersion where the photon sphere or black hole shadow vanishes, and where the
dark matter plasma becomes opaque to electromagnetic waves. Alternatively, we
point out that a non-observation of such deviations and characteristics, in
future, could put constraints on interesting regions of the particle physics
parameter space.

are usually determined by imposing appropriate gauge fixing conditions and then
demanding their preservation with respect to the dynamics generated by a
canonical Hamiltonian. Effective descriptions encoding quantum geometric
effects motivated by loop quantum gravity for symmetry reduced models are often
captured by polymerization of connection (or related) variables in gauge fixing
conditions as well as constraints. Usually, one chooses the same form of
polymerization in both cases. A pertinent question is if the dynamical
stability of the effective gauge fixing conditions under the effective dynamics
generated by the polymerized canonical Hamiltonian is provided by the lapse
function and the shift vector obtained from the polymerization of their
classical counterparts. If this is the case, then we say that gauge fixing and
polymerization commute. In this manuscript we investigate these issues and
obtain consistency conditions for the commutativity of gauge fixing and
polymerization. Our analysis shows that such a commutativity occurs in rather
special situations and reveals pitfalls in making seemingly well motivated
choices which turn out to be inconsistent with the effective dynamics. We
illustrate these findings via examples of symmetry reduced models in the loop
quantization of the Schwarzschild interior and Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB)
spacetimes and report the non-commutativity of gauge fixing and polymerization,

this work, we demonstrate the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to

using a suite of simulations, we present an ANN based framework capable of
extracting the \hi~ signal power spectrum directly from the total observed sky
power spectrum (which contains the 21-cm signal, along with the foregrounds and

separate neural networks sequentially. As the first step, \texttt{ANN1}
predicts the 21-cm power spectrum directly from foreground corrupted synthetic
datasets. In the second step, \texttt{ANN2} predicts the reionization

Such fatalism has the impact of ontologically defining acts such as winning,

Traditionally, such optimization has focused on a different metric, minimizing
single-shot makespan, and a well-known algorithm is the Heterogeneous Earliest
Finish Time (HEFT) algorithm. Maximizing throughput however, is more suitable
for many real-time, edge, cloud and IoT applications, we present a different
scheduling algorithm, namely Throughput HEFT (TPHEFT). Further, we present two
throughput-oriented enhancements which can be applied to any baseline schedule,
that we refer to as ""node splitting"" (SPLIT) and ""task duplication"" (DUP). In
order to implement and evaluate these algorithms, we built new subsystems and
plugins for an open-source dispersed computing framework called Jupiter.
Experiments with varying DAG structures indicate that: 1) TPHEFT can
significantly improve throughput performance compared to HEFT (up to 2.3 times
in our experiments), with greater gains when there is less degree of
parallelism in the DAG, 2) Node splitting can potentially improve performance
over a baseline schedule, with greater gains when there's an imbalanced
allocation of computation or inter-task communication, and 3) Task duplication
generally gives improvements only when running upon a baseline that places
communication over slow links. To our knowledge, this is the first study to

ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collision depends only, to a good

exact as long as transverse flow is negligible, and the system is in local
thermal equilibrium. We implement a state-of-the-art modelization of kinetic
and chemical equilibration in the early stages of the evolution to study the
modifications of the spectrum. Violations of M_t scaling resulting from these

the spectrum on system size, centrality, rapidity, and collision energy. We
show that the quark-gluon plasma produces more dileptons than the Drell-Yan

for a given M_t , the dependence of the dilepton yield on M is opposite for the
two processes, so that experiment alone can in principle determine which

populations of blocks and smaller boulders. These features decrease in
abundance with increasing exposure time due to comminution by impact

size-frequency distributions by updating the model of Hoerz et al. (1975) with
new input functions: the size-frequency distributions of cm-scale meteoroids
observed over the last few tens of years and a rock impact shattering function.
The impact shattering function is calibrated using measurements of a lunar
block size-frequency distribution of known age. We find that cumulative block
size-frequency distributions change with time from a power-law for young
populations (<~50 Myr) to an exponential distribution for older populations.
The new destruction rates are within the uncertainty of the original model,
although, for sizes >5 cm, two times faster than the original best estimate.
The faster rates are broadly consistent with observations reported by other
studies. Since the input functions are known for small rock sizes, the rock
abundance can be determined theoretically at sizes below the current image
spatial resolution (0.5 m). Surface exposure age of block fields can be
estimated together with the initial block abundance from the measurement of
block size-frequency distributions.

methods to detect shift or variance in data have not been significantly
researched. Challenges to this are the lack of effective approaches to learn
dense representation of a dataset and difficulties of sharing private data
across medical institutions. To overcome the problems, we propose a unified
pipeline called MedShift to detect the top-level shift samples and thus
facilitate the medical curation. Given an internal dataset A as the base
source, we first train anomaly detectors for each class of dataset A to learn
internal distributions in an unsupervised way. Second, without exchanging data
across sources, we run the trained anomaly detectors on an external dataset B
for each class. The data samples with high anomaly scores are identified as
shift data. To quantify the shiftness of the external dataset, we cluster B's
data into groups class-wise based on the obtained scores. We then train a
multi-class classifier on A and measure the shiftness with the classifier's
performance variance on B by gradually dropping the group with the largest
anomaly score for each class. Additionally, we adapt a dataset quality metric
to help inspect the distribution differences for multiple medical sources. We
verify the efficacy of MedShift with musculoskeletal radiographs (MURA) and
chest X-rays datasets from more than one external source. Experiments show our
proposed shift data detection pipeline can be beneficial for medical centers to
curate high-quality datasets more efficiently. An interface introduction video

applied in various DNN structures. Nevertheless, it stays ambiguous on how to
perform exclusive pruning on the ViT structure. Considering three key points:
the structural characteristics, the internal data pattern of ViTs, and the
related edge device deployment, we leverage the input token sparsity and
propose a computation-aware soft pruning framework, which can be set up on
vanilla Transformers of both flatten and CNN-type structures, such as
Pooling-based ViT (PiT). More concretely, we design a dynamic attention-based
multi-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for adaptive
instance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique,
which integrates the less informative tokens generated by the selector module
into a package token that will participate in subsequent calculations rather

between accuracy and computation constraints of specific edge devices through
our proposed computation-aware training strategy. Experimental results show
that our framework significantly reduces the computation cost of ViTs while
maintaining comparable performance on image classification. Moreover, our
framework can guarantee the identified model to meet resource specifications of

with ever-narrower linewidths are required as they enable higher-order
modulation formats with lower bit-error rates. In particular, semiconductor
lasers are a key component due to their compactness, low power consumption, and
potential for mass production. In field-testing scenarios their output is
coupled to a fiber, making them susceptible to external optical feedback (EOF).
This has a detrimental effect on its stability, thus it is traditionally
countered by employing, for example, optical isolators and angled output
waveguides. In this work, EOF is explored in a novel way with the aim to reduce
and stabilize the laser linewidth. EOF has been traditionally studied in the
case where it is applied to only one side of the laser cavity. In contrast,
this work gives a generalization to the case of feedback on both sides. It is
implemented using photonic components available via generic foundry platforms,
thus creating a path towards devices with high technology-readiness level.
Numerical results shows an improvement in performance of the double-feedback
case with respect to the single-feedback case. In particularly, by
appropriately selecting the phase of the feedback from both sides, a broad
stability regime is discovered. This work paves the way towards low-cost,

  of Sparse-Sparse Networks","32 pages and 20 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.AR cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In principle, sparse neural networks should be significantly more efficient
than traditional dense networks. Neurons in the brain exhibit two types of
sparsity; they are sparsely interconnected and sparsely active. These two types
of sparsity, called weight sparsity and activation sparsity, when combined,
offer the potential to reduce the computational cost of neural networks by two
orders of magnitude. Despite this potential, today's neural networks deliver
only modest performance benefits using just weight sparsity, because
traditional computing hardware cannot efficiently process sparse networks. In
this article we introduce Complementary Sparsity, a novel technique that
significantly improves the performance of dual sparse networks on existing
hardware. We demonstrate that we can achieve high performance running
weight-sparse networks, and we can multiply those speedups by incorporating
activation sparsity. Using Complementary Sparsity, we show up to 100X
improvement in throughput and energy efficiency performing inference on FPGAs.
We analyze scalability and resource tradeoffs for a variety of kernels typical
of commercial convolutional networks such as ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2. Our
results with Complementary Sparsity suggest that weight plus activation
sparsity can be a potent combination for efficiently scaling future AI models.

almost no research into using IV as an identification strategy in the presence

expensive-to-evaluate systems. However, depending on the cost of single
observations, multi-dimensional optimizations of one or more objectives may
still be prohibitively expensive. Multi-fidelity optimization remedies this
issue by including multiple, cheaper information sources such as low-resolution
approximations in numerical simulations. Acquisition functions for
multi-fidelity optimization are typically based on exploration-heavy algorithms
that are difficult to combine with optimization towards multiple objectives.
  Here we show that the expected hypervolume improvement policy can act in many
situations as a suitable substitute. We incorporate the evaluation cost either
via a two-step evaluation or within a single acquisition function with an
additional fidelity-related objective. This permits simultaneous
multi-objective and multi-fidelity optimization, which allows to accurately
establish the Pareto set and front at fractional cost. Benchmarks show a cost
reduction of an order of magnitude or more. Our method thus allows for Pareto
optimization of extremely expansive black-box functions.
  The presented methods are simple and straightforward to implement in
existing, optimized Bayesian optimization frameworks and can immediately be
extended to batch optimization. The techniques can also be used to combine
different continuous and/or discrete fidelity dimensions, which makes them
particularly relevant for simulation problems in plasma physics, fluid dynamics
and many other branches of scientific computing.

very challenging due to the exceeded number of zeros and skewness of the

data, including Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and
zero-inflated negative binomial models. One way to identify the most
appropriate probabilistic models for zero-inflated or hurdle models is based on
the p-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The main challenge for
identifying the probabilistic model is that the model parameters are typically
unknown in practice. This paper derives the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)
for a general class of zero-inflated and hurdle models. We also derive the
corresponding Fisher information matrices for exploring the estimator's
asymptotic properties. We include new probabilistic models such as
zero-inflated beta binomial and zero-inflated beta negative binomial models.
Our application to microbiome data shows that our new models are more
appropriate for modeling microbiome data than commonly used models in the

The inner distance of a matrix is the minimum value of the distance between
entries in adjacent cells, where our distance metric is distance modulo $n$.
Intuitively, one expects that most Latin squares have inner distance 1, for
example there probably exists a pair of adjacent cells with consecutive
integers. And very few should have \textit{maximum} inner distance; the maximum
inner distance was found by construction for all $n\geq 3$ to be exactly $\left
\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right \rfloor$. In this paper we also establish existence
for all smaller inner distances. Much of our introductory work is showcased in

elastic rods (our model for flagella) to investigate locomotion in GM. The
elastic flagella are rotated at one end by the motor, and they deform due to
the drag from GM, propelling the robot. The external drag is determined by the

external loading and elastic forces. In this coupled fluid-structure

decrease or increase the propulsive speed of the robot, depending on the

prediction quantitatively matches experiments when the flagellar deformation is

important role in the proposed systems for harnessing fusion energy, and
various other engineering and scientific problems. The interplay between the
magnetic fields and the fluid motion gives rise to complex flow physics, which
depend on the electrical conductivity of the bounding walls. An effective
approach to represent the latter is via the Shercliff boundary condition for
thin conducting walls relating the induced magnetic field and its wall normal
gradient at the boundary via a parameter referred to as the wall conductance
ratio (Shercliff, JA, J. Fluid Mech. 1, 644 (1956)). Within the framework of
the highly parallelizable lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, a lattice kinetic
scheme for MHD involving a vector distribution function for the magnetic fields
was proposed by Dellar (Dellar, PJ, J. Comp. Phys. 179, 95 (2002)). However,
the prior LB algorithms only accounted for limiting special cases involving
perfectly insulated boundaries and did not consider the finite conductivity
effects. In this paper, we present two new boundary schemes that enforce the
Shercliff boundary condition in the LB schemes for MHD. It allows for the
specification of the wall conductance ratio to any desired value based on the
actual conductivities and length scales of the container and the wall
thicknesses. One approach is constructed using a link-based formulation
involving a weighted combination of the bounce back and anti-bounce back of the
distribution function for the magnetic field and the other approach involves an
on-node moment-based implementation. Moreover, their extensions to representing
moving walls are also presented. Numerical validations of the boundary schemes
for body force or shear driven MHD flows for a wide range of the values of the
wall conductance ratio and their second order grid convergence are
demonstrated.

our previous work, where an agent learns to schedule only a single check node
(CN) within a group (cluster) of CNs per iteration, in this work we train the
agent to schedule all CNs in a cluster, and all clusters in every iteration.
That is, in each learning step of RELDEC an agent learns to schedule CN
clusters sequentially depending on a reward associated with the outcome of
scheduling a particular cluster. We also modify the state space representation
of the MDP, enabling RELDEC to be suitable for larger block length LDPC codes
than those studied in our previous work. Furthermore, to address decoding under
varying channel conditions, we propose two related schemes, namely, agile
meta-RELDEC (AM-RELDEC) and meta-RELDEC (M-RELDEC), both of which employ
meta-reinforcement learning. The proposed RELDEC scheme significantly

Event-triggered Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) framework, called AET-SGD, to
i) reduce the communication cost among the compute nodes, and ii) mitigate the

employs a linear increasing sample size event-triggered threshold, and can
significantly reduce the communication cost while keeping good convergence
performance. We implement AET-SGD and evaluate its performance on multiple

The experimental results validate the correctness of the design and show a

which the light propagates with non-trivial energy dispersions. When interfaced
with quantum emitters, such systems yield strong collective spontaneous
emission phenomena, such as perfect sub-radiance, in which the decay into the
bath is completely suppressed, forming bound-states-in-the-continuum. Since
such photonic lattices are generally lossy, an alternative way of probing them
consists in coherently driving them to an steady-state from which
photoluminescence can be extracted. Here, we formalize connections between
these two seemingly different situations and use that intuition to predict the
formation of non-trivial photonic steady-states in one and two dimensions. In
particular, we show that subradiant emitter configurations are linked to the
emergence of steady-state light-localization in the driven-dissipative setting,
in which the light features the same form than the spontaneously formed
bound-states-in-the-continuum. Besides, we also find configurations which leads
to the opposite behaviour, an anti-localization of light, that is, it
distributes over all the system except for the region defined between the
driving lasers. These results shed light on the recently reported
optically-defined cavities in polaritonic lattices, and can guide further
experimental studies.

Well-known nonparametric kernel smoother and $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN)
estimator, which take label average over a ball around the query, are
consistent but asymptotically biased particularly for a large radius of the
ball. To eradicate such bias, local polynomial regression (LPoR) and multiscale
$k$-NN (MS-$k$-NN) learn the bias term by local regression around the query and
extrapolate it to the query itself. However, their theoretical optimality has
been shown for the limit of the infinite number of training samples. For
correcting the asymptotic bias with fewer observations, this paper proposes a
\emph{local radial regression (LRR)} and its logistic regression variant called
\emph{local radial logistic regression~(LRLR)}, by combining the advantages of
LPoR and MS-$k$-NN. The idea is quite simple: we fit the local regression to
observed labels by taking only the radial distance as the explanatory variable
and then extrapolate the estimated label probability to zero distance. The
usefulness of the proposed method is shown theoretically and experimentally. We
prove the convergence rate of the $L^2$ risk for LRR with reference to

Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker formalism, and a Heisenberg model to establish a

confidence at the cost of rejecting the disputed sources that are

$H<24.5$ in CANDELS. Galaxies are clustered into 100 groups, each contains
galaxies with analogous characteristics. To explore the robustness of the
morphological classifications, we merge 100 groups into five categories by
visual verification, including spheroid, early-type disk, late-type disk,
irregular, and unclassifiable. After eliminating the unclassifiable category
and the sources with inconsistent voting, the purity of the remaining four
subclasses are significantly improved. Massive galaxies ($M_*>10^{10}M_\odot$)
are selected to investigate the connection with other physical properties. The
classification scheme separates galaxies well in the U-V and V-J color space

effective radii is shown from the spheroid subclass to the irregular subclass.
It suggests that the combination of CAE and multi-clustering strategy is an

of the author and C. Scarinci on the quantization of 3d gravity for positive
cosmological constant case. Then, from the associativity of the tensor cube,
and from the maps between the left and the right duals, we construct unitary

dotted ideal triangulations of punctured surfaces, as an analog of Kashaev's
quantum Teichm\""uller theory. The present work thus inspires one to look for a
Kashaev-type quantization of 3d gravity for positive cosmological constant.

severely. As a result, only limited violations of constraints or pessimistic
competitive bounds could be guaranteed. To tackle the challenge, we define a
measure of feasibility $\xi^*$ to evaluate the hardness of this problem, and
estimate this measurement by an optimization routine with theoretical

where we initialize a threshold price vector using the estimation, then
dynamically update the price vector and use it for decision-making at each
step. It can be shown that the proposed algorithm is
$\big(1-O(\frac{\varepsilon}{\xi^*-\varepsilon})\big)$ or
$\big(1-O(\frac{\varepsilon}{\xi^*-\sqrt{\varepsilon}})\big)$ competitive with
high probability for $\xi^*$ known or unknown respectively. To the best of our

this paper, we tackle this challenge by simultaneously training a group of

performance, two types of knowledge are transferred among the students to
enhance each other: local knowledge reflecting information in the graph
topology and node attributes, and global knowledge reflecting the prediction

of the local knowledge with an efficient adversarial cyclic learning framework.
Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our proposed online

However, it is theoretically unclear what physical processes are responsible
for such sudden formation of SCs in the SMC. Here we investigate whether
massive SCs with initial masses more than $10^5$ $\text{M}_\odot$ can be formed
during tidal interaction of the SMC with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) about
2 Gyr ago, based on our new simulations, which include molecular hydrogen
formation on dust grains and SC formation within giant molecular clouds (GMCs).
We find that the formation of GMCs with masses more than $10^5$
$\text{M}_\odot$ can be dramatically enhanced due to the tidal force of the
LMC-SMC interaction. We also find that gravitationally bound massive SCs can be
formed within these GMCs, though their mean stellar densities ($10^4$
$\text{M}_\odot \text{pc}^{-3}$) are systematically lower than those of the
genuine globular clusters (GCs). All simulated SCs have diffuse extended
stellar envelopes that were formed from multiple merging of sub clusters within
their natal GMCs. Furthermore, we find that some of the simulated SCs can have
considerable global internal rotation and substructures surrounding them. Based
on these simulation results, we discuss the origin of the observed diverse
properties of SCs in the SMC and the physical roles of galaxy interaction in
the formation of massive SCs from GMCs.

abundance variations may exist between first-generation (1G) stars. We propose
that metal abundance ('metallicity') spreads within GC forming giant molecular
clouds (GMCs) can influence the iron abundances of future cluster members. To
investigate this, we use original hydrodynamical simulations to model GMC
formation in a high redshift dwarf galaxy. Our simulations self-consistently
model physical processes such as stellar feedback, dust formation and
destruction, and molecular gas formation on dust grains, making them well
suited to the study of GMC formation. We conclude that iron abundance
variations in GMCs are due to the merging of gas clumps and self-enrichment
processes. The metallicity dispersions of GC forming clumps is ~0.1 dex,
reflecting a growing number of studies that claim a non-zero dispersion within
GCs. The galactic gas fraction is a key parameter for the formation of clumps
and the metallicity 'floor' observed for both Galactic and extragalactic GCs
are associated with the parent galaxy's capacity to form massive GMCs. Finally,
we argue that GMCs have the potential to trap surrounding metal-poor galactic
disc stars, which we interpret as a precursor population (0G). These low
metallicity stars are representative of the [Fe/H] value of the host dwarf and
thus the chemistry of this 0G may be a fossilized record of the parent galaxy.
These results depend on the initial metallicity and radial gradient of the
galaxy, the threshold gas density for star formation, and the star formation
prescription.

Unfortunately, significantly increasing the grid's fraction of solar energy
remains challenging due to its variability, which makes balancing electricity's

maximum rate that they can change their output -- is finite, solar's ramp rate
is essentially infinite. Thus, accurate near-term solar forecasting, or
nowcasting, is important to provide advance warning to adjust thermal generator
output in response to solar variations to ensure a balanced supply and demand.
To address the problem, this paper develops a general model for solar
nowcasting from abundant and readily available multispectral satellite data
using self-supervised learning. Specifically, we develop deep auto-regressive
models using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory
networks (LSTM) that are globally trained across multiple locations to predict
raw future observations of the spatio-temporal data collected by the recently

evaluate our approach for different coverage areas and forecast horizons across

to robustly decompose a video sequence into the background model and the
corresponding foreground part. However, this method needs to convert the color

the coupling information between the three channels of the color image. In this
study, we propose a quaternion-based DMD (Q-DMD), which extends the DMD by
quaternion matrix analysis, so as to completely preserve the inherent color
structure of the color image and the color video. We exploit the standard
eigenvalues of the quaternion matrix to compute its spectral decomposition and
calculate the corresponding Q-DMD modes and eigenvalues. The results on the

target object in remaining frames given its annotation in the first frame,
which has been actively studied in recent years. The key challenge lies in
finding effective ways to exploit the spatio-temporal context of past frames to
help learn discriminative target representation of current frame. In this
paper, we propose a novel Siamese network with a specifically designed
interactive transformer, called SITVOS, to enable effective context propagation
from historical to current frames. Technically, we use the transformer encoder
and decoder to handle the past frames and current frame separately, i.e., the
encoder encodes robust spatio-temporal context of target object from the past
frames, while the decoder takes the feature embedding of current frame as the
query to retrieve the target from the encoder output. To further enhance the
target representation, a feature interaction module (FIM) is devised to promote
the information flow between the encoder and decoder. Moreover, we employ the
Siamese architecture to extract backbone features of both past and current
frames, which enables feature reuse and is more efficient than existing
methods. Experimental results on three challenging benchmarks validate the
superiority of SITVOS over state-of-the-art methods.

Real-time multi-class weed identification enables species-specific treatment of

\textit{AIWeeds} (one/multiple kinds of weeds in one image), a library of about
10,000 annotated images of flax, and the 14 most common weeds in fields and

and Lorentz symmetries. The canonical quantization of the theory results in a
Lorentz-invariant equation of motion for the state vector or density matrix. We
derive the path integral formula of $S$-matrix and the diagrammatic rules for
both the stochastic free field theory and stochastic $\phi^4$-theory. The
Lorentz invariance of the random $S$-matrix is strictly proved. We then develop
a diagrammatic technique for calculating the density matrix. Without

We prove that the stochastic QFT is renormalizable even in the presence of

with a focus on an IR momentum cutoff scale $a$ that regularizes IR
singularities in the semiclassical expansion. Transseries expressions for
condensates and correlators are derived as series of the dynamical scale
$\Lambda$ (nonperturbative exponential) and coupling $\lambda_{\mu}$
renormalized at the momentum scale $\mu$. While there is no ambiguity when $a >
\Lambda$, we find for $a < \Lambda$ that the nonperturbative sectors have new
imaginary ambiguities besides the well-known renormalon ambiguity in the
perturbative sector. These ambiguities arise as a result of an analytic
continuation of transseries coefficients to small values of the IR cutoff $a$
below the dynamical scale $\Lambda$. We find that the imaginary ambiguities are
cancelled each other when we take all of them into account. By comparing the
semiclassical expansion with the transseries for the exact large-$N$ result, we
find that some ambiguities vanish in the $a \rightarrow 0$ limit and hence the
resurgence structure changes when going from the semiclassical expansion to the
exact result with no IR cutoff. An application of our approach to the ${\mathbb

studied in many different function spaces. In these settings, numerous papers
have been devoted to studying the properties of their zeros. In this paper, we
introduce the notion of optimal polynomial approximant in the space $L^p$,
$1\leq p\leq\infty$. We begin our treatment by showing existence and uniqueness
for $1<p<\infty$. For the extreme cases of $p=1$ and $p=\infty$, we show that
uniqueness does not necessarily hold. We continue our development by
elaborating on the special case of $L^2$. Here, we create a test to determine
whether or not a given 1st degree OPA is zero-free in $\overline{\mathbb{D}}$.
Afterward, we shed light on an orthogonality condition in $L^p$. This allows us
to study OPAs in $L^p$ with the additional tools from the $L^2$ setting.
Throughout this paper, we focus many of our discussions on the zeros of OPAs.
In particular, we show that if $1<p<\infty$, $f\in H^p$, and $f(0)\neq 0$, then
there exists a disk, centered at the origin, in which all the associated OPAs
are zero-free. Toward the end of this paper, we use the orthogonality condition
to compute the coefficients of some OPAs in $L^p$. To inspire further research
in the general theory, we pose several open questions throughout our
discussions.

trained to accomplish key tasks such as power control, beamforming and

interference management models: supervised learning (i.e., fitting labels
generated by an optimization algorithm) and unsupervised learning (i.e.,
directly optimizing some system performance measure). Although both of these
paradigms have been extensively applied in practice, due to the lack of any
theoretical understanding about these methods, it is not clear how to
systematically understand and compare their performance.
  In this work, we conduct theoretical studies to provide some in-depth
understanding about these two training paradigms. First, we show a somewhat
surprising result, that for some special power control problem, the
unsupervised learning can perform much worse than its supervised counterpart,
because it is more likely to stuck at some low-quality local solutions. We then
provide a series of theoretical results to further understand the properties of
the two approaches. Generally speaking, we show that when high-quality labels
are available, then the supervised learning is less likely to be stuck at a
solution than its unsupervised counterpart. Additionally, we develop a
semi-supervised learning approach which properly integrates these two training
paradigms, and can effectively utilize limited number of labels to find
high-quality solutions. To our knowledge, these are the first set of
theoretical results trying to understand different training approaches in
learning-based wireless communication system design.

servers down to smartphones. To address this growing demand, system integrators
are incorporating ever larger amounts of main memory, warranting rethinking of
memory management. In current systems, applications produce page fault
exceptions whenever they access virtual memory regions which are not backed by
a physical page. As application memory footprints grow, they induce more and
more minor faults. Handling of each minor fault can take few 1000's of
CPU-cycles and blocks the application till OS finds a free physical frame.
These page faults can be detrimental to the performance, when their frequency
of occurrence is high and spread across application run-time. Specifically,
lazy allocation induced minor page faults are increasingly impacting
application performance. Our evaluation of several workloads indicates an
overhead due to minor faults as high as 29% of execution time. In this paper,
we propose to mitigate this problem through a hardware, software co-design
approach. Specifically we first propose to parallelize portions of the kernel
page allocation to run ahead of fault time in a separate thread. Then we
propose the Minor Fault Offload Engine(MFOE), a per-core HW accelerator for
minor fault handling. MFOE is equipped with pre-allocated page frame table that
it uses to service a page fault. On a page fault, MFOE picks a pre-allocated
page frame from this table, makes an entry for it in the TLB, and updates the
page table entry to satisfy the page fault. The pre-allocation frame tables are
periodically refreshed by a background kernel thread, which also updates the
kernel memory management data-structures. We evaluate this system in the gem5
architectural simulator with a modified Linux kernel. Our results show that
MFOE improves the average critical-path fault handling latency by 33x.

stable phase space trajectory implying that the universe eventually transpires
to a dark energy dominated (de-Sitter) era, a two-fold degeneracy in the
spectrum of the critical points is found to arise in the inhomogeneous picture,
due to the possible growth and decay of matter density perturbations. Analyzing
the phase space dynamics of the growth factor, we show that it turns out to be
greater than unity initially, for one of the critical points, and leads to a
stable configuration as the fluctuations in the matter density die out
asymptotically. As to the growth index, we show that the only trajectory which
is physically plausible is the one that evolves mildly at high redshifts and
gets steeper as time progresses. However, such a trajectory amounts to the

the enhancement performance empirically. The empirical benchmark results show
that the Linearity of data and Exposure Time recorded in meta-data play the

list of received messages instead of the source information, introducing the
emerging concept of unsourced random access (URA). Although some massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) URA schemes have been proposed recently,
the unique propagation properties of millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO
systems are not fully exploited in conventional URA schemes. In grant-free
random access, the BS cannot perform receive beamforming independently as the
identities of active users are unknown to the BS. Therefore, only the intrinsic
beam division property can be exploited to improve the decoding performance. In
this paper, a URA scheme based on beam-space tree decoding is proposed for
mmWave massive MIMO system. Specifically, two beam-space tree decoders are
designed based on hard decision and soft decision, respectively, to utilize the
beam division property. They both leverage the beam division property to assist
in discriminating the sub-blocks transmitted from different users. Besides, the
first decoder can reduce the searching space, enjoying a low complexity. The
second decoder exploits the advantage of list decoding to recover the

accumulating evidence. If dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive

observable effects in a binary system. We consider extreme-mass-ratio inspiral

at a higher domain. These effects are more dramatic as the dark matter density
increases. The results indicate that the signal-to-noise ratio of EMRIs can be
strongly reduced near $10^{-3}\sim 0.3$~Hz but enhanced near $1.0$~Hz with a
higher sensitivity, which can be probed via the future space-borne
gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, LISA and TAIJI. The findings will have

variable occurrences, and use these to construct models for reasoning about

program in terms of effect operations.
  Using a simple test logic, we construct two sorts of predicate liftings,
which lift predicates on a result type to predicates on computations that
produce results of that type, each capturing a facet of program behaviour.
Firstly, we study inductive predicate liftings which can be used to describe
effectful notions of total correctness. Secondly, we study coinductive
predicate liftings, which describe effectful notions of partial correctness.
The two constructions are dual in the sense that one can be used to disprove
the other.
  The predicate liftings are used as a basis for an endogenous logic of
behavioural properties for higher-order programs. The program logic has a
derivable notion of negation, arising from the duality of the two sorts of
predicate liftings, and it generates a program equivalence which subsumes a
notion of bisimilarity. Appropriate definitions of inductive and coinductive
predicate liftings are given for a multitude of effect examples.

linear algebra. We show that the rate of convergence of this rule depends
solely on the regularity of the non-oscillatory part of the integrand. The
second one is constructed with respect to a sign-changing function and the
classical theory of Gaussian quadrature can not be used anymore. We explore
theoretical properties of this Gaussian quadrature, including the trajectories
of the quadrature nodes and the convergence rate of these nodes to the
endpoints of the integration interval, and prove its asymptotic error estimate
under suitable hypotheses. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate
the performance of the proposed methods.

Generative Adversarial Networks is whether they are truly able to capture the
real data distribution and, consequently, to sample from it. In particular, the
multidimensional nature of image distributions leads to a complex evaluation of
the diversity of GAN distributions. Existing approaches provide only a partial
understanding of this issue, leaving the question unanswered. In this work, we
introduce a loop-training scheme for the systematic investigation of observable
shifts between the distributions of real training data and GAN generated data.
Additionally, we introduce several bounded measures for distribution shifts,
which are both easy to compute and to interpret. Overall, the combination of
these methods allows an explorative investigation of innate limitations of
current GAN algorithms. Our experiments on different data-sets and multiple
state-of-the-art GAN architectures show large shifts between input and output
distributions, showing that existing theoretical guarantees towards the
convergence of output distributions appear not to be holding in practice.

gamma-ray sources with significant emission above 100 TeV, which may be strong
candidates of PeVatrons. Neutrino observations are crucial to diagnose whether
the gamma-ray radiative process is hadronic or leptonic. We use the Bayesian
method to analyze the ten-year (2008-2018) IceCube data, and hence constrain
the hadronic gamma-ray emission in the LHAASO sources. The present neutrino
data show that the hadronic gamma-ray flux from Crab Nebula is lower than the
observed gamma-ray flux at the 90% C.L. and contributes less than 86%, which
disfavors the hadronic origin of the gamma-rays below tens of TeV. For the
other LHAASO sources, the present neutrino observations cannot put useful
constraints on the gamma-ray radiative process. We consider the uncertainty of
the source extension: the upper limits on hadronic gamma-ray flux tend to
increase with the extension; and some sources, i.e., LHAASO J2032+4102, LHAASO
J1929+1745, and LHAASO J1908+0621, show relatively high statistical
significance of neutrino signals if the extension is <0.6 deg. We finally
estimate the future observational results of LHAASO sources by the proposed
neutrino telescopes. If the LHAASO-observed PeV gamma-rays are of hadronic
origin, Crab Nebula may be detected at >100 TeV at 3-sigma C.L. within 20 years
by a neutrino detector with the effective area 30 times that of IceCube.

quadratic eigenvalue problems (QEPs). We use refined isogeometric analysis
(rIGA) to solve quadratic eigenproblems. rIGA discretization, while conserving
desirable properties of maximum-continuity isogeometric analysis (IGA), reduces
the interconnection between degrees of freedom by adding low-continuity basis
functions. This connectivity reduction in rIGA's algebraic system results in
faster matrix LU factorizations when using multifrontal direct solvers. We
compare computational costs of rIGA versus those of IGA when employing Krylov
eigensolvers to solve quadratic eigenproblems arising in 2D vector-valued
multifield problems. For large problem sizes, the eigencomputation cost is
governed by the cost of LU factorization, followed by costs of several
matrix-vector and vector-vector multiplications, which correspond to Krylov
projections. We minimize the computational cost by introducing C^0 and C^1
separators at specific element interfaces for our rIGA generalizations of the
curl-conforming Nedelec and divergence-conforming Raviart-Thomas finite
elements. Let p be the polynomial degree of basis functions; the LU
factorization is up to O((p-1)^2) times faster when using rIGA compared to IGA
in the asymptotic regime. Thus, rIGA theoretically improves the total
eigencomputation cost by O((p-1)^2) for sufficiently large problem sizes. Yet,
in practical cases of moderate-size eigenproblems, the improvement rate
deteriorates as the number of computed eigenvalues increases because of
multiple matrix-vector and vector-vector operations. Our numerical tests show
that rIGA accelerates the solution of quadratic eigensystems by O(p-1) for
moderately sized problems when we seek to compute a reasonable number of
eigenvalues.

of the DC magnetization curve, M(Bappl), from a linear dependence. Surprisingly
enough we found that there is no mathematical routine which describes how this

and analysis to study the effect of four basic observational parameters
(baseline length, exposure time, equivalent diameter and spectral resolution)
on the data quality of differential phase curves (DPCs), furthermore on the
accuracy of distance measurement. In our simulation, we adopt an axis
symmetrical disc model of broad line region (BLR) to generate differential
phase signals. We find that the differential phases and their Poisson errors
could be amplified by extending the baseline, while the influence of OPD
(optical path difference) errors can be reduced during fitting the BLR model.
Longer exposure time or larger equivalent diameter helps reduce the absolute
Poisson error. Therefore, the relative error of DPCs could be reduce by
increasing any of the above three parameters, then the accuracy of distance
measurement could be improved. In contrast, the uncertainty of $D_{\rm{A}}$ (
absolute angular distances) could be improved with higher spectral resolution,
although the relative error of DPCs would be amplified. We show how the
uncertainty of distance measurement varies with the relative error of DPCs. For
our specific set of model parameters, without considering more complicated
structures and kinematics of BLRs in our simulation, it is found that the
relative error of DPCs $<$ 20$\%$ is a limit for accurate distance measurement.
The relative error of DPCs have a lower limit (roughly 5$\%$) and the
uncertainty of distance measurement can be better than 2$\%$.

Fermi-Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice. In the extended symmetry-adapted
VQE method, the Rayleigh quotient for the Hamiltonian and a parametrized
quantum state in a properly chosen subspace is minimized within the subspace
and is optimized among the variational parameters implemented on a quantum
circuit to obtain variationally the ground state and the ground-state energy.
The corresponding energy derivative with respect to a variational parameter is
expressed as a Hellmann-Feynman-type formula of a generalized eigenvalue
problem in the subspace, which thus allows us to use the parameter-shift rules
for its evaluation. The natural-gradient-descent method is also generalized to
optimize variational parameters in a quantum-subspace-expansion approach. As a
subspace for approximating the ground state of the Hamiltonian, we consider a
Krylov subspace generated by the Hamiltonian and a symmetry-projected
variational state, and therefore the approximated ground state can restore the
Hamiltonian symmetry that is broken in the parametrized variational state
prepared on a quantum circuit. We show that spatial symmetry operations for
fermions in an occupation basis can be expressed as a product of the
nearest-neighbor fermionic swap operations on a quantum circuit. We also
describe how the spin and charge symmetry operations, i.e., rotations, can be
implemented on a quantum circuit. By numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
the spatial, spin, and charge symmetry projections can improve the accuracy of
the parametrized variational state, which can be further improved
systematically by expanding the Krylov subspace without increasing the number
of variational parameters.

parallel fibers (f1, f2, and f3) with a roughly north-south orientation, using
the observations of molecular transitions of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1-0), N$_2$H$^+$
(1-0), and NH$_2$D (1$_{1,1}$-1$_{0,1}$) with the Combined Array for Research
in Millimeter Astronomy. These fibers are all mildly supersonic ($\sigma_{\rm
V}$ about 2 times the sound speed), having lengths around 2 pc and widths about
0.1 pc, and they entangle and conjoin in the south where the most active
high-mass star formation takes place. They all have line masses 1 - 2 orders of
magnitude higher than their low-mass counterparts and are gravitationally
unstable both radially and axially. However, only f1 exhibits high-mass star
formation all the way along the fiber, yet f2 and f3 show no signs of
significant star formation in their northern parts. A large velocity gradient
increasing from north to south is seen in f3, and can be well reproduced with a
model of free-fall motion toward the most massive and active dense core in the
region, which corroborates the global collapse of the ridge and suggests that
the disruptive effects of the tidal forces may explain the inefficiency of star
formation in f2 and f3. On larger scales, some of the lower-density, peripheral
filaments are likely to be the outer extensions of the fibers, and provide
hints on the origin of the ridge.

segmentation performance as a proxy for general visual perception and study
this novel task for several exploration and annotation methods, ranging from
frontier exploration baselines which use heuristic active learning, to a fully
learnable approach. For the latter, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning
(RL) based agent which jointly learns both navigation and active learning. A
point goal navigation formulation, coupled with a global planner which supplies
goals, is integrated into the RL model in order to provide further incentives
for systematic exploration of novel scenes. By performing extensive experiments

knowledge from previously explored scenes when exploring new ones, e.g. through
less granular exploration and less frequent requests for annotations. The
results also suggest that a learning-based agent is able to use its prior

born without formation of a disk/jet engine, and then the star will collapse

collapsar to produce a bright gamma-ray transient. We find that the black hole
rotation is further affected by self-gravity of the collapsing matter. Finally,

information concerning their surface history. Images of small asteroids from
spacecraft show a depletion in terms of smaller craters. Seismic shaking was
considered to be responsible for crater erasure and the main driver modifying
the geology of asteroids via regolith convection or the Brazil nut effect.
However, a recent artificial impact experiment on the asteroid Ryugu by the
Japanese Hayabusa2 mission revealed minimal seismic activity. To investigate
whether a seismic shaking model can reproduce the observed crater record, the
crater distribution on Ryugu was analyzed using crater production functions
under cohesionless conditions. Crater retention ages were estimated as a
function of crater diameter for Ryugu, Itokawa, Eros, and Bennu using the
crater size-frequency distribution and crater production function estimated for
those asteroids. We found that the power-law indices ""a"" are inconsistent with
diffusion processes (e.g., seismic shaking, a=2). This result suggests that
seismic shaking models based on diffusion equations cannot explain the crater
distribution on small asteroids. Alternative processes include surface flows,
possibly at the origin of geomorphological and spectral features of Ryugu. We
demonstrate that the vertical mixing of material at depths shallower than 1 m
occurs over 10^3-10^5 yr by cratering and obliteration. The young surface age
of Ryugu is consistent with the slow space weathering that results from
cratering, as suggested in previous studies. The timescale (10^4-10^6 yr)
required for resurfacing at depths of 2-4 m can be compared with the cosmic-ray
exposure ages of returned samples to constrain the distribution of impactors

TMB2 crystal structure comprises graphite-like honeycombed atomic sheets of B
interleaved by hexagonal close-packed TM layers. From the C32 crystal structure
stems unique properties including high melting point, hardness, and corrosion
resistance, yet limited oxidation resistance, combined with high electrical
conductivity. We correlate the underlying chemical bonding, orbital overlap,
and electronic structure to the mechanical properties, resistivity, and
high-temperature properties unique to this class of materials. The review
highlights the importance of avoiding contamination elements (like oxygen) and
boron segregation on both the target and substrate sides during sputter
deposition, for better-defined properties, regardless of the boride system
investigated. This is a consequence of the strong tendency for B to segregate
to TMB2 grain boundaries for boron-rich compositions of the growth flux. It is
judged that sputter deposition of TMB2 films is at a tipping point towards a

timing resolution of 18.3 $\pm$ \,0.2 ps. Alternative algorithms, based on
Constant Threshold Discrimination, but using multi-Charge above the threshold

often occluded by its end-effectors, whereas tactile sensing can measure areas
that are not accessible by vision. In the past decades, a number of tactile
sensors have been developed for robots and used for different robotic tasks. In
this chapter, we focus on the use of tactile sensing for robotic grasping and
investigate the recent trends in tactile perception of object properties. We
first discuss works on tactile perception of three important object properties
in grasping, i.e., shape, pose and material properties. We then review the
recent development in grasping stability prediction with tactile sensing. Among
these works, we identify the requirement for coordinating vision and tactile
sensing in the robotic grasping. To demonstrate the use of tactile sensing to
improve the visual perception, our recent development of vision-guided tactile
perception for crack reconstruction is presented. In the proposed framework,
the large receptive field of camera vision is first leveraged to achieve a
quick search of candidate regions containing cracks, a high-resolution optical
tactile sensor is then used to examine these candidate regions and reconstruct
a refined crack shape. The experiments show that our proposed method can
achieve a significant reduction of mean distance error from 0.82 mm to 0.24 mm

atmospheric surface layers in convective and stably stratified turbulence has
been developed using budget equations for turbulent energies and fluxes in the
Boussinesq approximation. In the lower part of the surface layer in the
atmospheric convective boundary layer (CBL), the rate of turbulence production
of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) caused by the mean-flow surface shear and
the shear of self-organised coherent structures is much larger than that caused
by the buoyancy, which results in three-dimensional turbulence of very complex
nature. In the upper part of the surface layer, the rate of turbulence
production of TKE due to the shear is much smaller than that caused by the
buoyancy, which causes unusual strongly anisotropic buoyancy-driven turbulence.
Considering the applications of the obtained results to the atmospheric
convective and stably stratified boundary-layer turbulence, the theoretical
relationships potentially useful in modelling applications have been derived.
In particular, the developed theory for the surface layers in turbulent
convection and stably stratified turbulence allows us to determine the vertical
profiles for all turbulent characteristics, including TKE, the intensity of
turbulent potential temperature fluctuations, the vertical turbulent fluxes of
momentum and buoyancy (proportional to potential temperature), the integral
turbulence scale, the turbulence anisotropy, the turbulent Prandtl number and

of the method, the solution of two problems is considered. The first task is
state feedback control of linear systems, taking into account the constraints
on the control signal and phase variables. The second task is output feedback
control of linear systems with a restriction on output and control. In both
problems, checking the stability of the closed-loop system is formulated in
terms of the solvability of linear matrix inequalities. The obtained results
are accompanied by examples of modeling that illustrate the efficiency of the

apparent positions of the shadows. Such observers are of interest to our work
because embedding diagrams have shown that de Sitter space-time is analogous to
an asymptotically flat one in the vicinity of the static radius. We also
perform a comparative analysis between our result with that in Ref.[1].
Furthermore, we numerically obtain the radii of curvature, vertical diameters

from that of a Kerr black hole. Additionally, for the same value of $\Lambda$,
KdS and RKdS black hole shadows are identical. Previously, it has also been
shown that when $\Lambda=1.11\times 10^{-52} m^{-2}$, KdS and Kerr black hole

the allowed range of the characteristic radius of the shadow, we obtain

have no direct channel between them, seek the assistance of an intermediate
relay to generate secret keys. In a celebrated version of the relay-assisted
protocol, as applied by Lai et al., Zhou et al., Wang et al. and Waqas et al.,
the relay node generates pair-wise keys with the two nodes, and then broadcasts
an XOR version of the two keys. Although such protocols are simple and
effective, we observe that they face reduction in key rates due to two
problems. First, for confidentiality, the relay broadcasts an XOR function of
the pair-wise keys thereby pruning the length of the shared key to be the
minimum of the key lengths of the pair-wise keys. Secondly, the broadcast phase
may also experience outages thereby not being able to share the generated key
in every round of the protocol. Identifying these issues, we propose a
buffer-aided relaying protocol wherein buffer is used at the relay to store
unused secret bits generated in the previous rounds of the protocol so as to
provide confidentiality in the subsequent rounds of broadcast. On this
buffer-aided protocol, we propose a power-allocation strategy between the
phases of key generation and broadcast so as to maximize the throughput and key
rate. Rigorous analyses show that buffer-aided relay when implemented along
with the proposed power-allocation strategy offer remarkable advantages over
existing baselines.

always hold for all eccentricities ($e$) given by the distance between the
centers of an outlet and the silo base, which is a typical metric of
eccentricity. Similar observations are noted for the profiles of solid

observed to be similar for different outlet sizes. In contrast, we observe, the
latter leads to differing flow patterns for the highest eccentricity wherein
the largest outlet touches the sidewall and the rest are located at a distance.

class of hairy black holes has been found to possess two unstable and one
stable circular null geodesics on the equatorial plane, corresponding to three
photon spheres outside the event horizon. In this paper, we study quasinormal
modes of the scalar field, which are associated with these circular null

enhance wireless communication performance cost effectively. The existing
literature has mainly considered IRS being deployed near user terminals to
improve their performance. However, this approach may incur a high cost if IRSs
need to be densely deployed in the network to cater to random user locations.
To avoid such high deployment cost, in this paper we consider a new IRS aided
wireless network architecture, where IRSs are deployed in the vicinity of each
base station (BS) to assist in its communications with distributed users
regardless of their locations. Besides significantly enhancing IRSs' signal
coverage, this scheme helps reduce the IRS associated channel estimation
overhead as compared to conventional user-side IRSs, by exploiting the nearly
static BS-IRS channels over short distance. For this scheme, we propose a new
two stage transmission protocol to achieve IRS channel estimation and
reflection optimization for uplink data transmission efficiently. In addition,
we propose effective methods for solving the user IRS association problem based
on long term channel knowledge and the selected user IRS BS cascaded channel
estimation problem. Finally, all IRSs' passive reflections are jointly
optimized with the BS's multi-antenna receive combining to maximize the minimum
achievable rate among all users for data transmission. Numerical results show
that the proposed co site IRS empowered BS scheme can achieve significant
performance gains over the conventional BS without co site IRS and existing
schemes for IRS channel estimation and reflection optimization, thus enabling
an appealing low cost and high performance BS design for future wireless
networks.

During anesthesia, the bispectral index (BIS) level is used as a control

can automatically adjust the infusion rate of anesthesia drugs without

networks trained on multiple tasks in sequence with stochastic gradient descent
often suffer from representational interference, whereby the learned weights

cost is due to the large number of low utility mutants that it introduces.
Although previous research has identified this issue, no previous study has
proposed any effective solution to the problem. Thus, it remains unclear how to
mutate and test a given piece of code in a best effort way, i.e., achieving a
good trade-off between invested effort and test effectiveness. To achieve this,
we propose Cerebro, a machine learning approach that statically selects
subsuming mutants, i.e., the set of mutants that resides on the top of the
subsumption hierarchy, based on the mutants' surrounding code context. We
evaluate Cerebro using 48 and 10 programs written in C and Java, respectively,
and demonstrate that it preserves the mutation testing benefits while limiting
application cost, i.e., reduces all cost application factors such as equivalent
mutants, mutant executions, and the mutants requiring analysis. We demonstrate
that Cerebro has strong inter-project prediction ability, which is
significantly higher than two baseline methods, i.e., supervised learning on
features proposed by state-of-the-art, and random mutant selection. More
importantly, our results show that Cerebro's selected mutants lead to strong
tests that are respectively capable of killing 2 times higher than the number
of subsuming mutants killed by the baselines when selecting the same number of
mutants. At the same time, Cerebro reduces the cost-related factors, as it
selects, on average, 68% fewer equivalent mutants, while requiring 90% fewer
test executions than the baselines.

loss and structural damage to components of gas turbine and rocket engines.
Traditional feedback controls to mitigate thermoacoustic instability possess
electromechanical components, which are expensive to maintain regularly and
unreliable in the harsh environments of combustors. In this study, we
demonstrate the quenching of thermoacoustic instability through self-coupling
-- a method wherein a hollow tube is used to provide acoustic self-feedback to
a thermoacoustic system. Through experiments and modeling, we identify the
optimal coupling conditions for attaining amplitude death, i.e., complete
suppression of thermoacoustic instabilities, in a horizontal Rijke tube. We
examine the effect of both system and coupling parameters on the occurrence of
amplitude death. We thereby show that the parametric regions of amplitude death
occur when the coupling tube length is close to an odd multiple of the length
of the Rijke tube. The optimal location of the coupling tube for achieving
amplitude death is near the anti-node of the acoustic standing wave in the
Rijke tube. Furthermore, we find that self-coupling mitigates thermoacoustic
instability in a Rijke tube more effectively than mutual coupling of two
identical Rijke tubes. Thus, we believe that self-coupling can prove to be a
simple, cost-effective solution for mitigating thermoacoustic instability in
gas turbine combustors.

accuracy but fail when common deformations, like affine local transformations

  Over the past five years, deep convolutional neural networks have
outperformed traditional methods for most computer vision tasks. We propose a
pipeline for feature tracking, that applies a convolutional stacked autoencoder
to identify the most similar crop in an image to a reference crop containing
the feature of interest. The autoencoder learns to represent image crops into
deep feature encodings specific to the object category it is trained on.
  We train the autoencoder on facial images and validate its ability to track
skin features in general using manually labeled face and hand videos. The
tracking errors of distinctive skin features (moles) are so small that we
cannot exclude that they stem from the manual labelling based on a
$\chi^2$-test. With a mean error of 0.6-4.2 pixels, our method outperformed the
other methods in all but one scenario. More importantly, our method was the
only one to not diverge.
  We conclude that our method creates better feature descriptors for feature

parameters subject of the discrepancy, using CMB $C_{\ell}$ combined with
cluster counts SZ sample with a free dark energy equation of state parameter
while allowing the clusters mass calibration parameter $(1-b)$ to vary. The
latter is degenerate with $\sigma_8$, which translates the discrepancy within
$\Lambda$CDM framework into one between $(1-b) \sim0.6$, corresponding to
constraints on $\sigma_8$ obtained from CMB, and $(1-b)\sim0.8$, the value
adopted for the SZ sample calibration. We find that a constant $w$, when left
free to vary along with large priors on the matter density ([0.1,1.0]) and
Hubble parameters ([30,200]), can reduce the discrepancy to less than 2$\sigma$
for values far below its fiducial $w$ = -1. However, the latter were not
allowed when we additionally combine with other probes like BAO feature angular
diameter distance measured in galaxies clustering surveys. We found also, when
we allow to vary, in addition to $w$, a modification of the growth rate through
the growth index $\gamma$, that the tension is alleviated, with $(1-b)$
likelihood now centered around the Planck calibration value of $\sim$ 0.8.
However, here again, combining with geometrical distance probes restores the
discrepancy, with $(1-b)$ preferred value reverting back to the $\Lambda$CDM
one of $\sim$ 0.6. The same situation is observed when introducing, along with
$w$ and $\gamma$, further extensions to $\Lambda$CDM like massive neutrinos,
although the latter allows to reduce the tension to 2$\sigma$, even when
combining with BAO datasets. We conclude that none of these common extensions
to $\Lambda$CDM is able to fix the discrepancy and a misdetermination of the
calibration factor is the most preferred explanation... (Abridged)

not fully implement the Einstein equation have recently been developed. Two of
the free-licensed ones are inhomog and gevolution. A key question is whether
globally emergent volume evolution that is faster than that of a Friedmannian
reference model results from the averaged effects of structure formation.
Checking that emergent volume evolution is correctly modelled by the packages
is thus needed. We numerically replace the software's default random
realisation of initial seed fluctuations by a fluctuation of spatially constant
amplitude in a simulation's initial conditions. The average volume evolution of
the perturbed model should follow that of a Friedmannian expansion history that
corresponds to the original Friedmannian reference solution modified by the
insertion of the spatially constant perturbation. We derive the equations that
convert from the perturbed reference solution to the effective solution. We
find that inhomog allows emergent volume evolution correctly at first order
through to the current epoch. For initial conditions with a resolution of $N =
128^3$ particles and an initial non-zero extrinsic curvature invariant $I_i =
0.001$, inhomog matches an exact Friedmannian solution to -0.0058% (Einstein-de
Sitter, EdS) or -0.0033% (LCDM). We find that gevolution models the decaying
mode to fair accuracy, and excludes the growing mode by construction. For $N =
128^3$ and an initial scalar potential $\Phi$ = 0.001, gevolution is accurate
for the decaying mode to 0.012% (EdS) or 0.013% (LCDM). We conclude that this
special case of an exact non-linear solution for a perturbed Friedmannian model
provides a robust calibration for relativistic cosmological simulations.

naturally reproduces X-ray-like and background-like events as results of X-ray
photon merging in a single pixel or in a chunk of adjacent pixels, allowing us
to construct a nonlinear spectral analysis framework that can treat pile-up
affected observation data. For validation, we have performed data analysis of
Suzaku XIS observations by using this framework with various parameters of the
detector simulation all of which are optimized for that instrument. We present
three cases of different pile-up degrees: PKS~2155-304 (negligible pile-up),
Aquila~X-1 (moderate pile-up), and the Crab Nebula (strong pile-up); we show
that the nonlinear analysis method produces results consistent with a
conventional linear analysis for the negligible pile-up condition, and
accurately corrects well-known pile-up effects such as spectral hardening and
flux decrease for the pile-up cases. These corrected results are consistent
with those obtained by a widely used core-exclusion method or by other
observatories with much higher timing resolutions (without pile-up). Our
framework is applicable to any types of CCDs used for X-ray astronomy including
a future mission such as XRISM by appropriate optimization of the simulation

predictor variable, denoted by $x$}, are to be determined with the goal of
estimating a function $m(x)$, which is observed with noise. A linear model is
fitted to $m(x)$ but it is not assumed that the model is correctly specified.
It follows that the quantity of interest is the best linear approximation of
$m(x)$, which is denoted by $\ell(x)$. It is shown that in this framework the
ordinary least squares estimator typically leads to an inconsistent estimation
of $\ell(x)$, and rather weighted least squares should be considered. An
asymptotic minimax criterion is formulated for this estimator, and a design
that minimizes the criterion is constructed. An important feature of this
problem is that the $x$'s should be random, rather than fixed. Otherwise, the
minimax risk is infinite. It is shown that the optimal random minimax design is
different from its deterministic counterpart, which was studied previously, and
a simulation study indicates that it generally performs better when $m(x)$ is a
quadratic or a cubic function. Another finding is that when the variance of the
noise goes to infinity, the random and deterministic minimax designs coincide.

commercially viable quantum technologies have inspired great interest in the
study of open quantum systems and their dynamics. Many open quantum systems are
well described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian generating a time
evolution that allows eigenstates to decay and dissipate to the environment. In
this framework, quantum coherent scaling is traditionally tied to the
appearance of dark states, where the effect of dissipation becomes negligible.
Here, we discuss the universal dynamical scaling after a sudden quench of the
non-Hermitian $O(N)$ model Hamiltonian. While universality is generally spoiled
by non-Hermiticity, we find that for a given set of internal parameters
short-time scaling behaviour is restored with an initial slip exponent
profoundly different from that of closed quantum systems. This result is tied
to the compensation of dissipation by interaction effects at short times
leading to a prethermal dark state, where coherent many-body dynamics can be
still observed.

improve to the same DMC energy as nodes optimized by variational Monte Carlo.
Our method, therefore, departs from the standard procedure of optimizing the

theory, or configuration interaction based calculation, which do not directly

by inducing the decay of the negative effective cosmological constant to the

space of the Hawking temperature and free energy is investigated in details. We
find that the free energy of the thermalon is always negative at the maximum of
Hawking temperature for all possible values of the Gauss-Bonnet couplings. This
means that the phase transition mediated by thermalon from AdS to dS
asymptotics is inevitable according to the presence of the massive gravity.

produced in Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) as a result of the dissipation of the jet

So far, the neutrino emission from the inelastic collisional model in GRBs has
been poorly investigated from the experimental point of view. In the present
work, we discuss prospects for identifying neutrinos produced in such
collisionally heated GRBs with the large volume neutrino telescopes KM3NeT and
IceCube, including their low-energy extensions, KM3NeT/ORCA and DeepCore,

from both individual and stacked GRBs, exploring bulk Lorentz factor values
ranging from 100 to 600. As a result of our analysis, individual searches
appear feasible only for extreme sources, characterized by gamma-ray fluence
values at the level of F$_{\gamma} \geq 10^{-2}$ erg cm$^{-2}$. In turn, it is
possible to detect a significant flux of neutrinos from a stacking sample of ~
900 long GRBs (that could be detected by current gamma-ray satellites in about
five years) already with DeepCore and KM3NeT/ORCA. The detection sensitivity
increases with the inclusion of data from the high-energy telescopes, IceCube

resonance probe (pMRP) is an optimized realization of APRS. It has a
non-invasive structure and allows simultaneous measurement of the electron
density, electron temperature, and electron-neutral collision frequency.
Previous work has investigated the pMRP through the Drude model and
collision-less kinetic model. The Drude model misses important kinetic effects
such as collision-less kinetic damping. The collision-less kinetic model is
able to capture pure kinetic effects. However, it is only applicable to
low-pressure plasma. To further study the behavior of the pMRP, we develop a
collisional kinetic model in this paper, which applies to arbitrary pressure.
In this model, the kinetic equation is coupled to the Poisson equation under
the electrostatic approximation. The real part of the general admittance is
calculated to describe the spectral response of the probe-plasma system. Both
collision-less kinetic damping and collisional damping appear in the spectrum.
This model provides a possibility to calculate the electron density, electron
temperature, and electron-neutral collision frequency from the measurements.

becomes the product of exactly three amputated Berends-Giele currents, while
the latter means that any two currents share one external particle. We call
these smooth splittings 3-splits. In fact, there are exactly $\binom{n}{3}-n$
such 3-splits, one for each generic, interior triangle in a polygon; as they
cannot be obtained from standard factorization, they are a new phenomenon in
Quantum Field Theory. In fact, the resulting splitting is analogous to the one
first seen in Cachazo-Early-Guevara-Mizera (CEGM) amplitudes which generalize
standard cubic scalar amplitudes from their ${\rm Tr}\, G(2,n)$ formulation to
${\rm Tr}\, G(k,n)$, where ${\rm Tr}\, G(k,n)$ is the tropical Grassmannian.
Along the way, we show how smooth splittings naturally lead to the discovery of
mixed amplitudes in the NLSM and special Galileon theories and to novel
BCFW-like recursion relations for NLSM amplitudes.

extremely rare and expensive. To circumvent these limitations with simpler

parameters such as time, current, solution concentration, and temperature were
systematically investigated. For each deposition, the efficiency of the process
was calculated by considering the filling fraction of the pores and the average
length of the wires, all of which were measured from the SEM images. A linear
growth versus time was observed within the parameter range. From the
experiments, it was observed that decreasing the current, increasing the
deposition temperature, and depositing for longer duration increased the
average length of the nanowires. The use of electrodeposition to grow metallic
nanowires can be extended to other pure metal and alloy systems.

  temperature response and wireless signal conversion",,,,,"physics.app-ph eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Highly sensitive smart sensors for early fire detection with remote warning
capabilities are urgently required to improve the fire safety of combustible
materials in diverse applications. The highly-sensitive fire alarm can detect
fire situation within a short time quickly when a fire disaster is about to
occur, which is conducive to achieve fire tuned. Herein, a novel fire alarm is
designed by using flame-retardant cellulose paper loaded with graphene oxide
(GO) and two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2, MXene). Owing to the
excellent temperature dependent electrical resistance switching effect of GO,
it acts as an electrical insulator at room temperature and becomes electrically
conductive at high temperature. During a fire incident, the partial
oxygen-containing groups on GO will undergo complete removal, which results in
the conductivity transformation.Besides the use of GO feature, this work also
introduces conductive MXene to enhance fire detection speed and warning at low
temperature, especially below 300 {\deg}C. The designed flame-retardant fire
alarm is sensitive enough to detect fire incident, showing a response time of 2
s at 250 {\deg}C, which is calculated by a novel and quantifiable technique.
More importantly, the designed fire alarm sensor is coupled to a wireless
communication interface to conveniently transmit fire signal remotely.
Therefore, when an abnormal temperature is detected, the signal is wirelessly
transmitted to a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen when displays a message
such as ""FIRE DANGER"". The designed smart fire alarm paper is promising for use
as a smart wallpaper for interior house decoration and other applications
requiring early fire detection and warning.

This benevolent approach can minimize cost and help the manufacturer to play a
role in sustaining the environment, something which is of utmost importance
these days because of growing environment concerns. Reuse of returned parts and
products aids environment sustainability because doing so helps reduce the use
of raw materials, eliminate energy use to produce new parts, and minimize waste
materials. However, handling returns effectively and efficiently can be
difficult if the processes do not provide the visibility that is necessary to
track, manage, and re-use the returns. This paper applies advanced analytics on
procurement data to increase reutilization in new build by optimizing
Equal-to-New (ETN) parts return. This will reduce 'the spend' on new buy parts
for building new product units. The process involves forecasting and matching
returns supply to demand for new build. Complexity in the process is the
forecasting and matching while making sure a reutilization engineering process
is available. Also, this will identify high demand/value/yield parts for
development engineering to focus. Analytics has been applied on different
levels to enhance the optimization process including forecast of upgraded
parts. Machine Learning algorithms are used to build an automated
infrastructure that can support the transformation of ETN parts utilization in
the procurement parts planning process. This system incorporate returns
forecast in the planning cycle to reduce suppliers liability from 9 weeks to 12
months planning cycle, e.g., reduce 5% of 10 million US dollars liability.

  Vehicles",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Mobile edge computing has become an effective and fundamental paradigm for
futuristic autonomous vehicles to offload computing tasks. However, due to the
high mobility of vehicles, the dynamics of the wireless conditions, and the
uncertainty of the arrival computing tasks, it is difficult for a single
vehicle to determine the optimal offloading strategy. In this paper, we propose
a Digital Twin (DT) empowered task offloading framework for Internet of
Vehicles. As a software agent residing in the cloud, a DT can obtain both
global network information by using communications among DTs, and historical
information of a vehicle by using the communications within the twin. The
global network information and historical vehicular information can
significantly facilitate the offloading. In specific, to preserve the precious
computing resource at different levels for most appropriate computing tasks, we
integrate a learning scheme based on the prediction of futuristic computing
tasks in DT. Accordingly, we model the offloading scheduling process as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP) to minimize the long-term cost in terms of a
trade off between task latency, energy consumption, and renting cost of clouds.
Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively find the
optimal offloading strategy, as well as achieve the fast convergence speed and
high performance, compared with other existing approaches.

  Architecture",,,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Post-translational modifications (PTMs) in proteins occur after the process
of translation. PTMs account for many cellular processes such as
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair, cell signaling and cell death. One of the
recent PTMs is succinylation. Succinylation modifies lysine residue from $-1$
to $+1$. Locating succinylation sites using experimental methods, such as mass
spectrometry is very laborious. Hence, computational methods are favored using
machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a deep learning architecture
to predict succinylation sites. The performance of the proposed architecture is
compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning architecture and other
traditional machine learning techniques for succinylation. It is shown from the
performance metrics that the proposed architecture provides a good trade-off
between speed of computation and classification accuracy.
