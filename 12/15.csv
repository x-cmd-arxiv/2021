experiment that we conducted in collaboration with a partner company. Our
experiment ran for 15 months during which time more than 14,000 study
participants (employees of the company) received different simulated phishing
emails in their normal working context. We also deployed a reporting button to
the company's email client which allowed the participants to report suspicious
emails they received. We measured click rates for phishing emails, dangerous
actions such as submitting credentials, and reported suspicious emails.
  The results of our experiment provide three types of contributions. First,
some of our findings support previous literature with improved ecological
validity. One example of such results is good effectiveness of warnings on
emails. Second, some of our results contradict prior literature and common
industry practices. Surprisingly, we find that embedded training during
simulated phishing exercises, as commonly deployed in the industry today, does
not make employees more resilient to phishing, but instead it can have
unexpected side effects that can make employees even more susceptible to
phishing. And third, we report new findings. In particular, we are the first to
demonstrate that using the employees as a collective phishing detection
mechanism is practical in large organizations. Our results show that such
crowd-sourcing allows fast detection of new phishing campaigns, the operational
load for the organization is acceptable, and the employees remain active over
long periods of time.

the ODiS (Organic Distribution System) initiative is to develop an architecture
to operate a distribution grid reliably, with high resiliency, and fully
autonomously by developing ""organic"" HEMS and DMS which possess multiple self-*

gives agents the choice between casting a direct vote or delegating their vote
to another agent. We consider a generalization of the standard liquid democracy
setting by allowing agents to specify multiple potential delegates, together
with a preference ranking among them. This generalization increases the number
of possible delegation paths and enables higher participation rates because
fewer votes are lost due to delegation cycles or abstaining agents. In order to
implement this generalization of liquid democracy, we need to find a principled
way of choosing between multiple delegation paths. In this paper, we provide a
thorough axiomatic analysis of the space of delegation rules, i.e., functions
assigning a feasible delegation path to each delegating agent. In particular,
we prove axiomatic characterizations as well as an impossibility result for
delegation rules. We also analyze requirements on delegation rules that have
been suggested by practitioners, and introduce novel rules with attractive
properties. By performing an extensive experimental analysis on synthetic as
well as real-world data, we compare delegation rules with respect to several
quantitative criteria relating to the chosen paths and the resulting
distribution of voting power. Our experiments reveal that delegation rules can
be aligned on a spectrum reflecting an inherent trade-off between competing

problem in which, (i) the output space is extremely large, (ii) each data point
may have multiple positive labels, and (iii) the data follows a strongly
imbalanced distribution. With applications in recommendation systems and
automatic tagging of web-scale documents, the research on XMTC has been focused
on improving prediction accuracy and dealing with imbalanced data. However, the
robustness of deep learning based XMTC models against adversarial examples has
been largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of XMTC models under adversarial
attacks. To this end, first, we define adversarial attacks in multilabel text
classification problems. We categorize attacking multilabel text classifiers as
(a) positive-targeted, where the target positive label should fall out of top-k
predicted labels, and (b) negative-targeted, where the target negative label
should be among the top-k predicted labels. Then, by experiments on APLC-XLNet
and AttentionXML, we show that XMTC models are highly vulnerable to
positive-targeted attacks but more robust to negative-targeted ones.
Furthermore, our experiments show that the success rate of positive-targeted
adversarial attacks has an imbalanced distribution. More precisely, tail
classes are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks for which an attacker can
generate adversarial samples with high similarity to the actual data-points. To
overcome this problem, we explore the effect of rebalanced loss functions in
XMTC where not only do they increase accuracy on tail classes, but they also
improve the robustness of these classes against adversarial attacks. The code

inputs with mask tokens to trigger mask-based proxy pre-training tasks (e.g.,
masked language modeling and masked object/frame prediction). In this work, we
argue that such masked inputs would inevitably introduce noise for cross-modal

under-explored. As an alternative, we derive a particular form of cross-modal
proxy objective for video-language pre-training, i.e., Contrastive Cross-modal

the noisy augmentation of primary unmasked ones, CoCo strengthens
video-language association by simultaneously pursuing inter-modal matching and
intra-modal denoising between masked and unmasked inputs in a contrastive
manner. Our CoCo proxy objective can be further integrated into any BERT-type
encoder-decoder structure for video-language pre-training, named as Contrastive
Cross-modal BERT (CoCo-BERT). We pre-train CoCo-BERT on TV dataset and a newly

learning methodologies. It is therefore appealing for domain adaptation
approaches to consider incorporating SSL. The intuition is to enforce
instance-level feature consistency such that the predictor becomes somehow
invariant across domains. However, most existing SSL methods in the regime of
domain adaptation usually are treated as standalone auxiliary components,
leaving the signatures of domain adaptation unattended. Actually, the optimal
region where the domain gap vanishes and the instance level constraint that SSL
peruses may not coincide at all. From this point, we present a particular
paradigm of self-supervised learning tailored for domain adaptation, i.e.,
Transferrable Contrastive Learning (TCL), which links the SSL and the desired
cross-domain transferability congruently. We find contrastive learning
intrinsically a suitable candidate for domain adaptation, as its instance
invariance assumption can be conveniently promoted to cross-domain class-level
invariance favored by domain adaptation tasks. Based on particular memory bank
constructions and pseudo label strategies, TCL then penalizes cross-domain
intra-class domain discrepancy between source and target through a clean and
novel contrastive loss. The free lunch is, thanks to the incorporation of
contrastive learning, TCL relies on a moving-averaged key encoder that
naturally achieves a temporally ensembled version of pseudo labels for target
data, which avoids pseudo label error propagation at no extra cost. TCL
therefore efficiently reduces cross-domain gaps. Through extensive experiments
on benchmarks (Office-Home, VisDA-2017, Digits-five, PACS and DomainNet) for
both single-source and multi-source domain adaptation tasks, TCL has

prioritize the assumption on semantic invariance across domains. Meanwhile, the
inherent intra-domain style invariance is usually underappreciated and put on
the shelf. In this paper, we reveal that leveraging intra-domain style
invariance is also of pivotal importance in improving the efficiency of domain
generalization. We verify that it is critical for the network to be informative
on what domain features are invariant and shared among instances, so that the
network sharpens its understanding and improves its semantic discriminative
ability. Correspondingly, we also propose a novel ""jury"" mechanism, which is
particularly effective in learning useful semantic feature commonalities among
domains. Our complete model called STEAM can be interpreted as a novel
probabilistic graphical model, for which the implementation requires convenient
constructions of two kinds of memory banks: semantic feature bank and style
feature bank. Empirical results show that our proposed framework surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by clear margins.

the apparent paradox between the nontriviality of free fermions and the

adaptive grid framework for numerical simulations on octree-based 3D
block-structured collocated grids with distributed computational architectures.
Our approach provides a consistent handling of non-lifted and lifted
interpolating wavelets of arbitrary order demonstrated using second, fourth,
and sixth order wavelets, combined with standard finite-difference based
discretization operators. We first validate that the wavelet family used
provides strict and explicit error control when coarsening the grid, and show
that lifting wavelets increase the grid compression rate while conserving
discrete moments across levels. Further, we demonstrate that high-order PDE
discretization schemes combined with sufficiently high order wavelets retain
the expected convergence order even at resolution jumps. We then simulate the
advection of a scalar to analyze convergence for the temporal evolution of a
PDE. The results shows that our wavelet-based refinement criterion is
successful at controlling the overall error while the coarsening criterion is
effective at retaining the relevant information on a compressed grid. Our
software exploits a block-structured grid data structure for efficient
multi-level operations, combined with a parallelization strategy that relies on
a one-sided MPI-RMA communication approach with active PSCW synchronization.
Using performance tests up to 16,384 cores, we demonstrate that this leads to a
highly scalable performance. The associated code is available under a BSD-3

increasing thanks to spectroscopic surveys. However different methodologies,
inputs and assumptions used in spectral analyses lead to different precisions
in [Fe/H] and possibly to systematic differences that need to be evaluated. It
is essential to understand the characteristics of each survey to fully exploit
their potential, in particular if the surveys are combined. The purpose of this
study is to compare [Fe/H] determinations from the largest spectroscopic
surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, the Gaia ESO survey, RAVE, LAMOST, SEGUE ) to other
catalogues taken as reference. Offsets and dispersions of the residuals are
examined as well as their trends with other parameters. We use reference
samples providing independent determinations of [Fe/H] which are compared to
those from the surveys for common stars. The distribution of the residuals is
assessed through simple statistics that measures the offset between two
catalogues and the dispersion representative of the precision of both
catalogues. When relevant, linear fits are performed. A large sample of
FGK-type stars with [Fe/H] based on high-resolution, high signal to noise
spectroscopy was built from the PASTEL catalogue to provide a reference sample.
We also use FGK members in open and globular clusters to assess the internal
consistency of [Fe/H] of each survey. The agreement of median [Fe/H] values for
clusters observed by different surveys is discussed. All the surveys
overestimate the low metallicities, and some of them also underestimate the
high metallicities. They perform well in the most populated intermediate
metallicity range, whatever the resolution. In most cases the typical precision
that we deduce from the comparisons is in good agreement with the uncertainties
quoted in the catalogues. Some exceptions to this general behaviour are
discussed.

$k$-resolved spin polarization gives the necessary insight to understand the
different charge-spin interconversion mechanisms. We have tested it in the
simplest scenario of isolated graphene in a perpendicular electric field where
effective tight-binding models are available to compare with. Our results show
that the flow of an unpolarized current across a single layer of graphene
produces, as expected, a spin separation perpendicular to the current for two
of the three spin components (out-of-plane and longitudinal), which is the
signature of the spin Hall effect. Additionally, it also yields an overall spin
accumulation for the third spin component (perpendicular to the current), which
is the signature of the Rashba-Edelstein effect. Even in this simple example,
our results reveal an unexpected competition between the Rashba and the
intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Remarkably, the sign of the accumulated spin
density does not depend on the electron or hole nature of the injected current
for realistic values of the Rashba coupling.

Quadratic (LQ) stochastic control problem for general partially-observed
systems. Our framework is motivated by the fact that the risk-neutral LQ
controllers, although optimal in expectation, might be ineffective under
relatively infrequent, yet statistically significant extreme events. To
effectively trade between average and extreme event performance, we introduce a
new risk constraint, which explicitly restricts the total expected predictive
variance of the state penalty by a user-prescribed level. We show that, under
certain conditions on the process noise, the optimal risk-aware controller can
be evaluated explicitly and in closed form. In fact, it is affine relative to
the minimum mean square error (mmse) state estimate. The affine term pushes the
state away from directions where the noise exhibits heavy tails, by exploiting
the third-order moment~(skewness) of the noise. The linear term regulates the
state more strictly in riskier directions, where both the prediction error
(conditional) covariance and the state penalty are simultaneously large; this
is achieved by inflating the state penalty within a new filtered Riccati
difference equation. We also prove that the new risk-aware controller is
internally stable, regardless of parameter tuning, in the special cases of i)
fully-observed systems, and ii) partially-observed systems with Gaussian noise.
The properties of the proposed risk-aware LQ framework are lastly illustrated
via indicative numerical examples.

formalizes this scalable supervision problem by considering remotely located

information about the evolution and function of these genes, but also to
understand cancer as a driving force in biological systems and species life
histories. So far, comparative studies of cancer genes have focused on mammals.
Here, we provide the first comparative study of cancer-related gene copy number
variation in fish. As fish are evolutionarily older and genetically more
diverse than mammals, their tumour suppression mechanisms should not only
include most of the mammalian mechanisms, but also reveal novel (but
potentially phylogenetically older) previously undetected mechanisms. We have
matched the sequenced genomes of 65 fish species from the Ensemble database
with the cancer gene information from the COSMIC database. By calculating the
number of gene copies across species using the Ensembl CAFE data (providing
species trees for gene copy number counts), we were able to develop a novel,
less resource demanding method for ortholog identification. Our analysis
demonstrates a masked relationship with cancer-related gene copy number
variation (CNV) and maximum lifespan in fish species, suggesting that higher
tumour suppressor gene CNV lengthens and oncogene CNV shortens lifespan, when
both traits are added to the model. Based on the correlation between tumour
suppressor and oncogene CNV, we were able to show which species have more
tumour suppressors in relation to oncogenes. It could therefore be suggested
that these species have stronger genetic defences against oncogenic processes.
Fish studies could yet be a largely unexplored treasure trove for understanding
the evolution and ecology of cancer, by providing novel insights into the study
of cancer and tumour suppression, in addition to the study of fish evolution,
life-history trade-offs, and ecology.

salient information and accurate semantic descriptions. The main issue is how
to make the output summary semantically consistent with the input document. To
reach this goal, recently, researchers have focused on supervised end-to-end
hybrid approaches, which contain an extractor module and abstractor module.
Among them, the extractor identifies the salient sentences from the input
document, and the abstractor generates a summary from the salient sentences.
This model successfully keeps the consistency between the generated summary and
the reference summary via various strategies (e.g., reinforcement learning).
There are two semantic gaps when training the hybrid model (one is between
document and extracted sentences, and the other is between extracted sentences
and summary). However, they are not explicitly considered in the existing
methods, which usually results in a semantic bias of summary. To mitigate the
above issue, in this paper, a new \textbf{r}einforcing
s\textbf{e}mantic-\textbf{sy}mmetry learning \textbf{m}odel is proposed for
document summarization (\textbf{ReSyM}). ReSyM introduces a
semantic-consistency reward in the extractor to bridge the first gap. A
semantic dual-reward is designed to bridge the second gap in the abstractor.
The whole document summarization process is implemented via reinforcement
learning with a hybrid reward mechanism (combining the above two rewards).
Moreover, a comprehensive sentence representation learning method is presented
to sufficiently capture the information from the original document. A series of
experiments have been conducted on two wildly used benchmark datasets CNN/Daily
Mail and BigPatent. The results have shown the superiority of ReSyM by
comparing it with the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of various evaluation
metrics.

experimental values of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can be fully
accommodated by considering the contribution of few Kaluza-Klein (KK) states of
the gauged lepton number with masses lighter than the LEP energy, consistently
with present experimental limits. In this article, we construct the minimal
embedding of the Standard Model (SM) into D-brane configurations with a gauged
lepton number. In order to give rise to such KK modes, the lepton number gauge
boson must live on an abelian $U(1)_L$ brane extended along at least one
""large"" extra dimension in the bulk, with a compactification scale
$M_L\sim\mathcal{O}(10-10^2~{\rm GeV})$ for a string scale $M_s\sim 10~{\rm
TeV}$. As a consequence, $U(1)_L$ cannot participate to the hypercharge linear
combination. We show that the minimal realisation of this framework contains
five stacks of branes: the SM color $U(3)_c$, weak $U(2)_w$ and abelian $U(1)$
stacks extended effectively only in four dimensions, the bulk $U(1)_L$, as well
as a fifth $U(1)^{'}$ brane. With these five abelian factors, one finds besides
the hypercharge a second anomaly-free linear combination which does not couple
to the SM spectrum, both in the non-supersymmetric case as well as in the
minimal supersymmetric extension of the model. It is also shown how the
right-handed neutrino can be implemented in the spectrum, and how fermions
arising from the two non-SM branes and coupled to the SM through the $U(1)_L$
KK modes can provide Dark Matter candidates. Finally, the possibility of
breaking Lepton Flavour Universality is studied by replacing $U(1)_L$ with a
brane gauging only the muonic lepton number, avoiding most experimental
constraints and enlarging the parameter space for explaining the discrepancy on
the muon magnetic moment.

mechanical response of the gel, and therefore enables precise tuning of the
material properties under careful preparation. Here we demonstrate how the
dynamics of a deformable inclusion, namely a bubble, can be used to locally
tune the microstructure of a colloidal gel. We examine two different phenomena
of bubble dynamics that apply a local strain to the surrounding material:
dissolution due to mass transfer, with a characteristic strain rate of
$10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$; and volumetric oscillations driven by ultrasound, with a
characteristic frequency of $10^4$ s$^{-1}$.
  We characterise experimentally the microstructure of a model colloidal gel
around bubbles in a Hele-Shaw geometry using confocal microscopy and particle
tracking. In bubble dissolution experiments, we observe the formation of a
pocket of solvent next to the bubble surface, but marginal changes to the
microstructure. In experiments with ultrasound-induced bubble oscillations, we
observe a striking rearrangement of the gel particles into a microstructure
with increased local ordering. High-speed bright-field microscopy reveals the
occurrence of both high-frequency bubble oscillations and steady microstreaming
flow; both are expected to contribute to the emergence of the local order in
the microstructure. These observations open the way to local tuning of
colloidal gels based on deformable inclusions controlled by external pressure
fields.

insight with an aggregation scheme, which borrows statistical strength across a

produce an optimal treatment ""roll out"" policy. We evaluate our methodology

ensure that the treatment effect is more accurately estimated.

complete anonymization for their servers/botmasters or suffer from slow

propose a new generation hybrid botnet that covertly and efficiently
communicates over Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN), called LNBot. Exploiting
various anonymity features of LN, we show the feasibility of a scalable
two-layer botnet which completely anonymizes the identity of the botmaster. In
the first layer, the botmaster anonymously sends the commands to the command
and control (C&C) servers through regular LN payments. Specifically, LNBot
allows botmaster's commands to be sent in the form of surreptitious multi-hop
LN payments, where the commands are either encoded with the payments or
attached to the payments to provide covert communications. In the second layer,
C&C servers further relay those commands to the bots in their mini-botnets to
launch any type of attacks to victim machines. We further improve on this
design by introducing D-LNBot; a distributed version of LNBot that generates
its C&C servers by infecting users on the Internet and forms the C&C
connections by opening channels to the existing nodes on LN. In contrary to the
LNBot, the whole botnet formation phase is distributed and the botmaster is
never involved in the process. By utilizing Bitcoin's Testnet and the new
message attachment feature of LN, we show that D-LNBot can be run for free and
commands are propagated faster to all the C&C servers compared to LNBot. We
presented proof-of-concept implementations for both LNBot and D-LNBot on the
actual LN and extensively analyzed their delay and cost performance. Finally,
we also provide and discuss a list of potential countermeasures to detect LNBot
and D-LNBot activities and minimize their impacts.

find that the synchronous gauge tends to contain large artificial enhancements

the nature of their progenitors. Here we demonstrate the effects of
observational selection biases on analyses of the distributions of FRB
host-galaxy properties (including star-formation rate, SFR, and stellar mass,
$M_{*}$), and on the distributions of FRB offsets from the centres of their
hosts. We consider the effects of ""radio selection"", wherein FRBs with larger
dispersion measures and scattering timescales are less likely to be detected,
and the effects of ""optical selection"", wherein FRBs with fainter host galaxies
are more likely to have unidentified or mis-identified hosts. We develop a
plausible, illustrative model for these effects in observations of FRBs and
their host galaxies by combining the output catalogues of a semi-analytic
galaxy formation model with a recently developed algorithm to associate FRBs
with host galaxies (PATH). We find that optical selection biases are most
important for the host-galaxy $M_{*}$ and SFR distributions, and that radio
selection biases are most important for the distribution of FRB projected
physical offsets. For our fiducial simulation of FRBs at $z<0.5$, the selection
biases cause the median host-galaxy SFR to be increased by $\sim0.3$ dex, and
the median $M_{*}$ by $\sim0.5$ dex. The median projected physical offset is
increased by $\sim2$ kpc ($\sim0.25$ dex). These effects are sufficiently large
so as to merit careful consideration in studies of localised FRBs, and our
simulations provide a guide towards their mitigation.

$\log_{10} n = 0.86^{+0.73}_{-0.84}$ for the leakage, which for the first are
constrained jointly with the BBH population at cosmological distances. These
constraints are consistent with General Relativity (GR) where gravitational
waves propagate in $D=3+1$ spacetime dimensions. Using the BBH population to
probe modifications to standard cosmological models provides an independent
test of GR that does not rely on any electromagnetic information but purely on
gravitational wave observations.

signals for cluster detection using cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys.
The noise arises both from neighboring objects and also from haloes below the
detection limit. A wide range of surveys are considered: SPT-SZ, SPTpol, and
SPT-3G from the South Pole Telescope; SO-Baseline and SO-Goal configurations
for Simons Observatory; CMB-S4's wide area (S4-Wide) and deep (S4-Ultra deep)
surveys; and the futuristic CMB-HD experiment. We find that the noise from tSZ
signals has a significant impact on CMB-HD and to some extent on S4-Ultra deep.
For other experiments, the effect is negligible as the noise in the tSZ map is
dominated by residual foregrounds or experimental noise. In the limit when the
noise from tSZ signals is important, we find that removing the detected
clusters and rerunning the cluster finder allows us to find a new set of less
massive and distant clusters. Since the detected clusters are the dominant
source of the tSZ power, removing them reduces the power at $\ell=3000$ by:
$\times5$ for CMB-HD; $\times3.1$ of S4-Ultra deep; $\times2.4$ for S4-Wide and
SPT-3G; $\times1.5$ for SO-Goal and SPTpol; $\times1.35$ for SO-Baseline; and
$\times1.08$ for SPT-SZ. We forecast the expected number of clusters and also
derive parameter constraints by combining cluster counts with primary CMB and
tSZ power spectra finding that the future surveys can reduce the error on the
dark energy equation of state parameter to sub-percent levels and can also
enable $\ge3\sigma$ detection of the sum of neutrino masses. The simulation

blending of objects due to higher surface density in the more crowded images; a
considerable fraction of the galaxies which we hope to use for cosmology
analyses will overlap each other on the observed sky. In order to investigate
these challenges, we emulate blending in a mock catalogue consisting of
galaxies at a depth equivalent to 1.3 yr of the full 10-yr Rubin Observatory
that includes effects due to weak lensing, ground-based seeing, and the
uncertainties due to extraction of catalogues from imaging data. The emulated
catalogue indicates that approximately 12 per cent of the observed galaxies are
``unrecognized'' blends that contain two or more objects but are detected as
one. Using the positions and shears of half a billion distant galaxies, we
compute shear--shear correlation functions after selecting tomographic samples
in terms of both spectroscopic and photometric redshift bins. We examine the
sensitivity of the cosmological parameter estimation to unrecognized blending
employing both jackknife and analytical Gaussian covariance estimators. An
$\sim0.025$ decrease in the derived structure growth parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8

However, we argue that it might not be the best choice given the difference in

matching, which retrieves targets from all cameras and all times. In contrast,
data association in tracking is a local matching problem, since its candidates
only come from neighboring locations and time frames. In this paper, we design
experiments to verify such misfit between global re-ID feature distances and
local matching in tracking, and propose a simple yet effective approach to
adapt affinity estimations to corresponding matching scopes in MTMCT. Instead
of trying to deal with all appearance changes, we tailor the affinity metric to
specialize in ones that might emerge during data associations. To this end, we
introduce a new data sampling scheme with temporal windows originally used for
data associations in tracking. Minimizing the mismatch, the adaptive affinity
module brings significant improvements over global re-ID distance, and produces

spaces in General Relativity for any value of the cosmological constant using

locally (A)dS spacetimes with leaky boundary conditions in the
Starobinsky/Fefferman-Graham gauge. The boundary structure is allowed to
fluctuate and plays the role of source yielding some flux of gravitational
radiation at the boundary. The holographic renormalization procedure is
employed to obtain finite surface charges for the whole class of boundary
diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings. We then propose a boundary gauge fixing
isolating the radiative boundary degrees of freedom without constraining the
Cauchy problem in asymptotically dS spacetimes. The residual gauge
transformations form the infinite-dimensional $\Lambda$-BMS algebroid, which
reduces to the Generalized BMS algebra of smooth supertranslations and
super-Lorentz transformations in the flat limit. The analysis is repeated in
the Bondi gauge in which we identify the analogues of the Bondi news, mass and
angular momentum aspects in the presence of a cosmological constant. We give a
prescription to perform the flat limit of the phase space and demonstrate how
to use this connection to renormalize the corresponding phase space of
asymptotically locally flat spacetimes at null infinity including smooth
super-Lorentz transformations. In that context, we discuss the memory effects
associated with super-Lorentz vacuum transitions and finally provide a new

Submitted to AAS Journals",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Mapping exoplanets across phases and during secondary eclipse is a powerful
technique for characterizing Hot Jupiters in emission. Since these planets are
expected to rotate about axes normal to their orbital planes, with rotation
periods synchronized with their orbital periods, mapping provides a direct
correspondence between orbital phase and planetary longitude. For planets with
fewer constraints on their spin properties, the relationship between the shape
of the eclipse light curve and the visible portion of the surface is more
complex. We develop a framework to understand the information content of
planets where the rotation rate and/or axis orientation are not well
constrained, by constructing a basis of emission time series (""light curves"")
that are orthogonal in integrated flux across secondary eclipse. The most
orthogonal bases in eclipse consist of periodic functions - akin to sinusoids -
and at slow enough rotation rates these follow a monotonic series in frequency.
If only data during eclipse are considered, we show that very similar light
curves at a given frequency can be generated by maps of similar complexity at a
wide range of spin axis orientations. Constraining spin axis orientations from
eclipse data alone may therefore depend on strong prior knowledge of plausible
emission map structures and/or rotation rates. When the planetary rotation
period becomes shorter than the total eclipse duration, there will be an
additional ambiguity between the complexity of the emission map and observable
variations due to rotation, as both can in principle generate similar signals.
By modeling example eclipse observations of the Warm Jupiter HAT-P-18 b, we
demonstrate that the available signal-to-noise for $\sim 10$ orbits is just
sufficient to derive map structure beyond the eclipse depth.

require non-trivial fusion of multiple input domains. Although multimodal
models have shown potential in many problems, their increased complexity makes
them more vulnerable to attacks. A Backdoor (or Trojan) attack is a class of
security vulnerability wherein an attacker embeds a malicious secret behavior
into a network (e.g. targeted misclassification) that is activated when an
attacker-specified trigger is added to an input. In this work, we show that
multimodal networks are vulnerable to a novel type of attack that we refer to
as Dual-Key Multimodal Backdoors. This attack exploits the complex fusion
mechanisms used by state-of-the-art networks to embed backdoors that are both
effective and stealthy. Instead of using a single trigger, the proposed attack
embeds a trigger in each of the input modalities and activates the malicious
behavior only when both the triggers are present. We present an extensive study
of multimodal backdoors on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task with
multiple architectures and visual feature backbones. A major challenge in
embedding backdoors in VQA models is that most models use visual features
extracted from a fixed pretrained object detector. This is challenging for the
attacker as the detector can distort or ignore the visual trigger entirely,
which leads to models where backdoors are over-reliant on the language trigger.
We tackle this problem by proposing a visual trigger optimization strategy
designed for pretrained object detectors. Through this method, we create

formation by comparing theoretical predictions from cosmological simulations:
EAGLE, Illustris and IllustrisTNG with observations of the local Universe from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our machine learning (ML) classification
reveals supermassive black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) as the most predictive
parameter in determining whether a galaxy is star forming or quenched at
redshift $z=0$ in all three simulations. This predicted consequence of active
galactic nucleus (AGN) quenching is reflected in the observations, where it is
true for a range of indirect estimates of $M_{\rm BH}$ via proxies as well as
its dynamical measurements. Our partial correlation analysis shows that other
galactic parameters lose their strong association with quiescence, once their
correlations with $M_{\rm BH}$ are accounted for. In simulations we demonstrate
that it is the integrated power output of the AGN, rather than its
instantaneous activity, which causes galaxies to quench. Finally, we analyse
the change in molecular gas content of galaxies from star forming to passive
populations. We find that both gas fractions ($f_{\rm gas}$) and star formation
efficiencies (SFEs) decrease upon transition to quiescence in the observations
but SFE is more predictive than $f_{\rm gas}$ in the ML passive/star-forming
classification. These trends in the SDSS are most closely recovered in
IllustrisTNG and are in direct contrast with the predictions made by Illustris.
We conclude that a viable AGN feedback prescription can be achieved by a
combination of preventative feedback and turbulence injection which together
quench star formation in central galaxies.

morphological evolution of the 102 massive quiescent galaxies in the mass range
of $10.5<\log(M_{\rm stellar}/M_{\odot})<11.5$ selected at $z=0$. The
morphology of galaxies is quantified based on their kinematics, and we measure
the quenching timescale of individual galaxies directly from star formation
history. We show that galaxies tend to be quenched more rapidly if they: (i)
are satellites in massive halos, (ii) have lower star-forming gas fractions, or
(iii) inject a larger amount of black hole kinetic feedback energy. By
following the global evolutionary pathways, we conclude that quiescent discs
are mainly disc galaxies that are recently and slowly quenched. Approximately
half of the quiescent ellipticals at $z=0$ are rapidly quenched at higher
redshifts while still disc-like. While being quiescent, they gradually become
more elliptical mostly by disc heating, yet these ellipticals still retain some
degree of rotation. The other half of quiescent ellipticals with the most
random motion-dominated kinematics build up large spheroidal components before
quenching primarily by mergers, or in some cases, misaligned gas accretion.
However, the mergers that contribute to morphological transformation do not
immediately quench galaxies in many cases. In summary, we find that quenching
and morphological transformation are decoupled. We conclude that the TNG black
hole feedback -- in combination with the stochastic merger history of galaxies
-- leads to a large diversity of quenching timescales and a rich morphological
landscape.

azimuthal asymmetries that start at subleading power, and which give access to
novel transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs). Theoretical
predictions for these distributions are currently based on the parton model
rather than a rigorous factorization based analysis. Working under the
assumption that leading power Glauber interactions do not spoil factorization
at this order, we use the Soft Collinear Effective Theory to derive a complete

This yields generalized definitions of the TMDs that depend on two longitudinal
momentum fractions (one of them only relevant beyond tree level), and a
complete proof that only the same leading power soft function appears and can
be absorbed into the TMD distributions at this order. We also show that
perturbative corrections can be accounted for with only one new hard
coefficient. Factorization formulae are given for all spin dependent structure
functions which start at next-to-leading power. Prospects for improved
subleading power predictions that include resummation are discussed.

CMB lensing roughly doubles the dark energy figure-of-merit from Roman

models of Type I (finite distance), Type II or Type III (infinite distance).
For elliptic K3 surfaces, we characterise the underlying Weierstrass models in
detail. Similarly to the known two classes of Type II Kulikov models for
elliptic K3 surfaces we find that the Weierstrass models of the more elusive
Type III Kulikov models can be brought into two canonical forms. We furthermore
show that all infinite distance limits are related to degenerations of
Weierstrass models with non-minimal singularities in codimension one or to
models with degenerating generic fibers as in the Sen limit. We explicitly work
out the general structure of blowups and base changes required to remove the
non-minimal singularities. These results form the basis for a classification of

efforts. The mass of dark matter candidates can span a wide range, and its
coupling with the Standard Model sector remains uncertain. All these unknowns

with $m \sim10^{-22}$ eV, is proposed to reconcile the disagreements between
observations and predictions from simulations of small-scale structures in the
cold dark matter paradigm, while remaining consistent with other observations.
Because of its large de Broglie wavelength and large local occupation number
within galaxies, ultralight dark matter behaves like a coherently oscillating
background field with an oscillating frequency dependent on its mass. If the
dark matter particle is a spin-1 dark photon, such as the $U(1)_B$ or
$U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson, it can induce an external oscillating force and lead
to displacements of test masses. Such an effect would be observable in the form
of periodic variations in the arrival times of radio pulses from highly stable
millisecond pulsars. In this study, we search for evidence of ultralight dark
photon dark matter (DPDM) using 14-year high-precision observations of 26
pulsars collected with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. While no statistically
significant signal is found, we place constraints on coupling constants for the

improved by up to two orders of magnitude when the dark photon mass is smaller

general quark-level EFT describing charged-current interactions between quarks
and leptons is matched to the nucleon-level non-relativistic EFT at the O(MeV)
momentum scale characteristic for beta transitions. The matching takes into
account, for the first time, the effect of all possible
beyond-the-Standard-Model interactions at the subleading order in the recoil
momentum. We calculate the impact of all the Wilson coefficients of the leading
and subleading EFT Lagrangian on the differential decay width in allowed beta
transitions. As an example application, we show how the existing experimental
data constrain the subleading Wilson coefficients corresponding to
pseudoscalar, weak magnetism, and induced tensor interactions. The data display
a 3.5 sigma evidence for nucleon weak magnetism, in agreement with the theory
prediction based on isospin symmetry.

counterparts, the dustless Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon (dLHdC) stars have been
known to exhibit enhanced s-processed material on their surfaces, especially
Sr, Y, and Ba. No comprehensive work has been done to explore the s-process in
these types of stars, however one particular RCB star, U Aqr, has been under
scrutiny for its extraordinary Sr enhancement. Aims: We aim to identify RCB and
dLHdC stars that have significantly enhanced Sr abundances, such as U Aqr, and
use stellar evolution models to begin to estimate the type of neutron exposure
that occurs in a typical HdC star. Methods: We compare the strength of the Sr
II 4077 $\AA$ spectral line to Ca II H to identify the new subclass of Sr-rich
HdCs. We additionally use the structural and abundance information from
existing RCB MESA models to calculate the neutron exposure parameter, $\tau$
Results: We identify six stars in the Sr-rich class. Two are RCBs, and four are
dLHdCs. We additionally find that the preferred RCB MESA model has a neutron
exposure $\tau$ ~ 0.1 mb$^{-1}$, which is lower than the estimated $\tau$
between 0.15 and 0.6 mb$^{-1}$ for the Sr-rich star U Aqr found in the
literature. We find trends in the neutron exposure corresponding to He-burning
shell temperature, metallicity, and assumed s-processing site. Conclusions: We
have found a sub-class of 6 HdCs known as the Sr-rich class, which tend to lie
in the halo, outside the typical distribution of RCBs and dLHdCs. We find that
dLHdC stars are more likely to be Sr-rich than RCBs, with an occurrence rate of
~13\% for dLHdCs and ~2\% for RCBs. This is one of the first potential
spectroscopic differences between RCBs and dLHdCs, along with dLHdCs having
stronger surface abundances of $^{18}$O.

For a constant density circumburst medium, the total number of emitted

out the existing picture that RCB stars represent an evolved stage of dLHdC

stars were known to have no circumstellar dust shell. This is in complete
contrast to the $\sim$130 known Galactic HdC stars that are notorious for being
heavy dust producers, i.e. the R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. Together they
form a rare class of supergiant stars that are thought to originate from the
merger of CO/He white dwarf binary systems, otherwise known as the
double-degenerate scenario. We searched for new dustless HdC (dLHdC) stars. We
used primarily the 2MASS and GAIA eDR3 catalogues to select candidates that
were followed-up spectroscopically. We discovered 27 new dLHdC stars, one new
RCB star and two new EHe stars. Surprisingly, 20 of the new dLHdC stars share a
characteristic of the known dLHdC star HD 148839, having lower atmospheric
hydrogen deficiencies. The uncovered population of dLHdC stars exhibit a
Bulge-like distribution, like the RCB stars, but show multiple differences from
those that indicate they are a different population of HdC stars following its
own evolutionary sequence with a fainter luminosity and also a narrow range of
effective temperature. We found indication of a current low dust production
activity for four of the new dLHdC stars which could be typical RCB stars
passing through a transition time. We have evidence for the first time of a
large range of absolute magnitudes in the overall population of HdC stars,
spanning over 3 mag. In the favoured formation framework, this is explained by
a large range in the initial total WD binary mass which leads to a series of
evolutionary sequences with distinct maximum brightness and initial
temperature. The cold Galactic RCB stars are also noticeably fainter than the
Magellanic ones, possibly due to a difference in metallicity resulting in
different WD mass ratio. In our Galaxy, there could be as many dLHdC stars as
RCB stars.

used to compute numerically the renormalized $\epsilon$-finite master integrals
for arbitrary external momentum invariant, in special cases with internal
masses equal to a single scale or zero. These include the ones necessary for
the three-loop QCD corrections to the self-energies of the W, Z, and Higgs

applications, many of which rely on the possibility to switch on and off the
non-trivial topology. Typically this control is achieved through strain or
external electric fields, which require energy consumption to be maintained. On
the contrary, a non-volatile mechanism would be highly beneficial and could be
realized through ferroelectricity if opposite polarization states are
associated with different topological phases. While this is not possible in a
single ferroelectric material where the two polarization states are related by
inversion, the necessary asymmetry could be introduced by combining a
ferroelectric layer with another two-dimensional (2D) trivial insulator. Here,
by means of first-principles simulations, not only we propose that this is a
promising strategy to engineer non-volatile ferroelectric control of
topological order in 2D heterostructures, but also that the effect is robust
and can survive up to room temperature, irrespective of the weak van der Waals
coupling between the layers. We illustrate the general idea by considering a
heterostructure made of a well-known ferroelectric material, In$_2$Se$_3$, and
a suitably chosen, easily exfoliable trivial insulator, CuI. In one
polarization state the system is trivial, while it becomes a QSHI with a robust
band gap upon polarization reversal. Remarkably, the topological band gap is
mediated by the interlayer hybridization and allows to maximise the effect of
intralayer spin-orbit coupling, promoting a robust ferroelectric topological
phase that could not exist in monolayer materials and is resilient against
relative orientation and lattice matching between the layers.

  Conjecture for Degree and Betweenness Centralities",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of betweenness centrality remains a fundamental unsolved problem
in complex networks. After a pioneering work by Barthelemy, it has been
well-accepted that the maximal betweenness-degree ($b$-$k$) exponent for
scale-free (SF) networks is $\eta_{\text{max}}=2$, belonging to scale-free
trees (SFTs), based on which one concludes $\delta\ge\frac{\gamma+1}{2}$, where
$\gamma$ and $\delta$ are the scaling exponents of the distribution functions
of the degree and betweenness centrality, respectively. Here we present
evidence for violation of this conjecture for SF visibility graphs (VGs). To
this end, we consider the VG of three models: two-dimensional (2D)
Bak-Tang-Weisenfeld (BTW) sandpile model, 1D fractional Brownian motion (FBM)
and, 1D Levy walks, the two later cases are controlled by the Hurst exponent
$H$ and step-index $\alpha$, respectively. Specifically, for the BTW model and
FBM with $H\lesssim 0.5$, $\eta$ is greater than $2$, and also
$\delta<\frac{\gamma+1}{2}$ for the BTW model, while Barthelemy's conjecture
remains valid for the Levy process. We argue that this failure of Barthelemy's
conjecture is due to large fluctuations in the scaling $b$-$k$ relation
resulting in the violation of hyperscaling relation
$\eta=\frac{\gamma-1}{\delta-1}$ and emergent anomalous behaviors for the BTW
model and FBM. A super-universal behavior is found for the distribution
function for a generalized degree function identical to the Barabasi-Albert
network model.

Background temperature maps and its origin has been subject to active debate.
As an important foreground structure at low redshift, the Eridanus supervoid
was recently detected, but it was subsequently determined that, assuming the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model, only about 10-20$\%$ of the observed temperature
depression can be accounted for via its Integrated Sachs-Wolfe imprint.
However, $R\gtrsim100~h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ supervoids elsewhere in the sky have
shown ISW imprints $A_{\mathrm{ISW}}\approx5.2\pm1.6$ times stronger than
expected from $\Lambda$CDM ($A_{\mathrm{ISW}}=1$), which warrants further
inspection. Using the Year-3 redMaGiC catalogue of luminous red galaxies from
the Dark Energy Survey, here we confirm the detection of the Eridanus supervoid
as a significant under-density in the Cold Spot's direction at $z<0.2$. We also
show, with $\mathrm{S/N}\gtrsim5$ significance, that the Eridanus supervoid
appears as the most prominent large-scale under-density in the dark matter mass
maps that we reconstructed from DES Year-3 gravitational lensing data. While we
report no significant anomalies, an interesting aspect is that the amplitude of
the lensing signal from the Eridanus supervoid at the Cold Spot centre is about
$30\%$ lower than expected from similar peaks found in N-body simulations based
on the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with parameters $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.279$ and
$\sigma_8 = 0.82$. Overall, our results confirm the causal relation between
these individually rare structures in the cosmic web and in the CMB, motivating
more detailed future surveys in the Cold Spot region.

learned model. However, imperfect models can result in real-world constraint
violations even for actions that are predicted to satisfy all constraints. We
propose Conservative and Adaptive Penalty (CAP), a model-based safe RL
framework that accounts for potential modeling errors by capturing model
uncertainty and adaptively exploiting it to balance the reward and the cost
objectives. First, CAP inflates predicted costs using an uncertainty-based
penalty. Theoretically, we show that policies that satisfy this conservative
cost constraint are guaranteed to also be feasible in the true environment. We
further show that this guarantees the safety of all intermediate solutions
during RL training. Further, CAP adaptively tunes this penalty during training
using true cost feedback from the environment. We evaluate this conservative
and adaptive penalty-based approach for model-based safe RL extensively on
state and image-based environments. Our results demonstrate substantial gains
in sample-efficiency while incurring fewer violations than prior safe RL
algorithms. Code is available at: https://github.com/Redrew/CAP

this Letter, we investigate the fate of Kitaev's spin liquid in the presence of
disorder -- bond defects or vacancies -- for an extended version of the model.
Considering static flux backgrounds, we observe a power-law divergence in the
low-energy limit of the density of states with a nonuniversal exponent. We link
this power-law distribution of energy scales to weakly coupled droplets inside
the bulk, in an uncanny similarity to the Griffiths phase often present in the
vicinity of disordered quantum phase transitions. If time-reversal symmetry is
broken, we find that power-law singularities are tied to the destruction of the
topological phase of the Kitaev model in the presence of bond disorder alone.
However, there is a transition from this topologically trivial phase with
power-law singularities to a topologically nontrivial one for weak to moderate
site dilution. Therefore, diluted Kitaev materials are potential candidates to
host Kitaev's chiral spin-liquid phase.

an adjunct therapy to enhance host immunity to fight against this intractable

parameters, the parameter regions for different disease outcomes are identified
from an established ODE model. Interestingly, the ODE model also demonstrates
that the immune responses can both benefit and impede disease progression,
depending on the number of bacteria engulfed and released by macrophages. We
then develop two It\^{o} SDE models, which consider the impact of demographic
variations at the cellular level and environmental variations during therapies
along with demographic variations. The SDE model with demographic variation
suggests that stochastic fluctuations at the cellular level have significant
influences on (1) the T-cell population in all parameter regions, (2) the
bacterial population when parameters located in the region with multiple
disease outcomes, and (3) the uninfected macrophage population in the parameter
region representing active disease. Further, considering environmental
variations from therapies, the second SDE model suggests that disease
progression can slow down if therapies (1) can have fast return rates and (2)
can bring parameter values into the disease clearance regions.

Mapping (SLAM) based Autonomous Navigation system. The motivation for this
study was to find a solution for navigating interior spaces autonomously.
Interior navigation is challenging as it can be forever evolving. Solving this
issue is necessary for multitude of services, like cleaning, the health
industry, and in manufacturing industries. The focus of this paper is the
description of the SLAM-based software architecture developed for this proposed
autonomous system. A potential application of this system, oriented to a smart
wheelchair, was evaluated. Current interior navigation solutions require some
sort of guiding line, like a black line on the floor. With this proposed
solution, interiors do not require renovation to accommodate this solution. The
source code of this application has been made open source so that it could be
re-purposed for a similar application. Also, this open-source project is
envisioned to be improved by the broad open-source community upon past its
current state.

Designing a modular and highly reusable system that combines flexibility

this need. Specification of the backbone of the system, with the interfaces and

for building such a system. The design process and implementation of an

discussion is supported by showing the application of this methodology to
constructing two dissimilar systems for rotating coil measurements, both based
on the same architecture and sharing core hardware modules and many software

most known intermediate polar cataclysmic variables due to its proposed
magnetic field strength (9-27 MG) and disk-less accretion. To date, the exact
accretion mechanism of the system is still unknown, and standard accretion
models fail to accurately predict the peculiar behavior of its lightcurve. We
present the K2 Campaign~11 light curve of V2400 Oph recording 74.19 days of
photometric data cadenced at 1 minute. The light curve is dominated by
aperiodic flickering and quasi-periodic oscillations, which make the beat and
spin signals inconspicuous on short timescales. Notably, a log-log full power
spectrum shows a break frequency at $\sim10^2$ cycles~d$^{-1}$ similar to some
disk-fed systems. Through power spectral analysis, the beat and spin periods
are measured as $1003.4\pm0.2$ seconds and $ 927.7\pm 0.1$ seconds
respectively. A power spectrum of the entire K2 observation demonstrates beat
period dominance. However, time-resolved power spectra reveals a strong
dependence between observation length and the dominant frequency of the light
curve. For short observations (2-12 hrs) the beat, spin, or first beat harmonic
can be observed as the dominant periodic signal. Such incoherence and
variability indicate a dynamical accretion system more complex than current
intermediate polar theories can explain. We propose that a diamagnetic blob
accretion model may serve as a plausible explanation for the accretion
mechanism.

manifolds of the form $(0,t_0]\times \mathbb{T}^{n-1}$, $t_0>0$. Stability is
established under the assumption that the initial data is
\textit{synchronized}, which means that on the initial hypersurface $\Sigma=
\{t_0\}\times \mathbb{T}^{n-1}$ the scalar field $\tau=
\exp\bigl(\sqrt{\frac{2(n-2)}{n-1}}\phi\bigr) $ is constant, that is,
$\Sigma=\tau^{-1}(\{t_0\})$. As we show that all initial data sets that are
sufficiently close to FRLW ones can be evolved via the Einstein-scalar field
equation into new initial data sets that are \textit{synchronized}, no
generality is lost by this assumption. By using $\tau$ as a time coordinate, we
establish that the perturbed FLRW spacetime manifolds are of the form $M =

the perturbed FLRW solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner as $\tau

scalar curvature, occurs at $\tau=0$. An important aspect of our stability
proof is that we use a hyperbolic gauge reduction of the Einstein-scalar field
equations. As a consequence, all of the estimates used in the stability proof
can be localized and we employ this property to establish a corresponding

it is desirable to improve the extraction efficiency of single photons. In
particular controlling the directionality and solid angle of the emission are
key parameters, for instance, to couple single photons into optical fibers and
send the information encoded in quantum light over long distances, for quantum
communication applications. In addition, fundamental studies of the radiative
behavior of quantum emitters, including studies of coherence and blinking,
benefit from such improved photon collection. Quantum dots grown via
Stranski-Krastanov technique have shown to be good candidates for bright,
coherent, indistinguishable quantum light emission. However, one of the
challenges associated with these quantum light sources arises from the fact
that the emission wavelengths can vary from one emitter to the other. To this
end, broadband light extractors that do not rely on high-quality factor optical
cavities would be desirable, so that no tuning between the quantum dot emission
wavelength and the resonator used to increase the light extraction is needed.
Here, we show that metallic nano-rings combined with gold back reflectors
increase the collection efficiency of single photons and we study the
statistics of this effect when quantum dots are spatially randomly distributed
within the nano-rings. We show an average increase in the brightness of about a
factor 7.5, when comparing emitters within and outside the nano-rings in
devices with a gold back reflector, we measure count rates exceeding 7 x 10^6

between classical and quantum value. One of the reasons is that estimating the
classical value is usually a hard computational task. This paper is devoted to
analyzing classical values of the so-called linear games (generalization of XOR
games to a larger number of outputs). We employ nontrivial results from graph
theory and combine them with number theoretic results used earlier in the
context of harmonic analysis to obtain a novel tool -- {\it the girth method}
-- allowing to provide explicit examples of linear games with prescribed low
classical value. In particular, we provide games with minimal possible
classical value. We then speculate on the potential unbounded violation, by
comparing the obtained classical values with a known upper bound for the
quantum value. If this bound can be even asymptotically saturated, our games
would have the best ratio of quantum to classical value as a function of the
product of the number of inputs and outputs when compared to other explicit
(i.e. non-random) constructions.

Often, we are interested in understanding how entities in a graph are
interconnected. The Graph Neural Network (GNN) has proven to be a very useful
tool in a variety of graph learning tasks including node classification, link
prediction, and edge classification. However, in most of these tasks, the graph
data we are working with may be noisy and may contain spurious edges. That is,
there is a lot of uncertainty associated with the underlying graph structure.
Recent approaches to modeling uncertainty have been to use a Bayesian framework
and view the graph as a random variable with probabilities associated with
model parameters. Introducing the Bayesian paradigm to graph-based models,
specifically for semi-supervised node classification, has been shown to yield
higher classification accuracies. However, the method of graph inference
proposed in recent work does not take into account the structure of the graph.
In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Bayesian Graph Convolutional
Network using Neighborhood Random Walk Sampling (BGCN-NRWS), which uses a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based graph sampling algorithm utilizing graph
structure, reduces overfitting by using a variational inference layer, and
yields consistently competitive classification results compared to the
state-of-the-art in semi-supervised node classification.

trajectory sampling methods, such as the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM), for
planning in continuous control settings. These zeroth-order optimizers require
sampling a large number of trajectory rollouts to select an optimal action,
which scales poorly for large prediction horizons or high dimensional action
spaces. First-order methods that use the gradients of the rewards with respect
to the actions as an update can mitigate this issue, but suffer from local
optima due to the non-convex optimization landscape. To overcome these issues
and achieve the best of both worlds, we propose a novel planner, Cross-Entropy
Method with Gradient Descent (CEM-GD), that combines first-order methods with
CEM. At the beginning of execution, CEM-GD uses CEM to sample a significant
amount of trajectory rollouts to explore the optimization landscape and avoid
poor local minima. It then uses the top trajectories as initialization for
gradient descent and applies gradient updates to each of these trajectories to
find the optimal action sequence. At each subsequent time step, however, CEM-GD
samples much fewer trajectories from CEM before applying gradient updates. We
show that as the dimensionality of the planning problem increases, CEM-GD
maintains desirable performance with a constant small number of samples by
using the gradient information, while avoiding local optima using initially
well-sampled trajectories. Furthermore, CEM-GD achieves better performance than
CEM on a variety of continuous control benchmarks in MuJoCo with 100x fewer
samples per time step, resulting in around 25% less computation time and 10%
less memory usage. The implementation of CEM-GD is available at

some parameters. After discussing the notion of phases of parametrized systems,
we formulate a bulk-boundary correspondence for an important bulk quantity, the
Kapustin-Spodyneiko higher Berry curvature, first in one spatial dimension and
then in arbitrary dimension. This clarifies the physical interpretation of the
higher Berry curvature, which in one spatial dimension is a flow of (ordinary)
Berry curvature. In d dimensions, the higher Berry curvature is a flow of
(d-1)-dimensional higher Berry curvature. Based on this, we discuss
one-dimensional systems that pump Chern number to/from spatial boundaries,
resulting in anomalous boundary modes featuring isolated Weyl points. In higher
dimensions, there are pumps of the analogous quantized invariants obtained by
integrating the higher Berry curvature. We also discuss the consequences for
parametrized systems of Kitaev's proposal that invertible phases are classified
by a generalized cohomology theory, and emphasize the role of the suspension
isomorphism in generating new examples of parametrized systems from known
invertible phases. Finally, we present a pair of general quantum pumping
constructions, based on physical pictures introduced by Kitaev, which take as
input a d-dimensional parametrized system, and produce new (d+1)-dimensional
parametrized systems. These constructions are useful for generating examples,
and we conjecture that one of the constructions realizes the suspension
isomorphism in a generalized cohomology theory of invertible phases.

down the RG flow at a finite length scale leading to an incomplete RG flow to

albeit still poorly explored. Furthermore, the structure of the brain network
exhibits progressive changes across the lifespan, but little is known about the
possible consequences in the controllability properties. To address these
questions, we adopted a novel target controllability approach that quantifies
the centrality of brain nodes in controlling specific target anatomo-functional
systems. We then studied such target control centrality in human connectomes
obtained from healthy individuals aged from 5 to 85. Main results showed that
the sensorimotor system has a high influencing capacity, but it is difficult
for other areas to influence it. Furthermore, we reported that target control
centrality varies with age and that temporal-parietal regions, whose cortical
thinning is crucial in dementia-related diseases, exhibit lower values in older
people. By simulating targeted attacks, such as those 19 occurring in focal
stroke, we showed that the ipsilesional hemisphere is the most affected one
regardless of the damaged area. Notably, such degradation in target control
centrality was more evident in younger people, thus supporting
early-vulnerability hypotheses after stroke.

decisions can be viewed as separate moves, which is already a common practice
in multi-action games for efficiency reasons. Such division of a player move
into a sequence of simpler / lower level moves is called \emph{splitting}. So
far, split moves have been applied only in forementioned straightforward cases,
and furthermore, there was almost no study revealing its impact on agents'
playing strength. Taking the knowledge-free perspective, we aim to answer how
to effectively use split moves within Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and what
is the practical impact of split design on agents' strength. This paper
proposes a generalization of MCTS that works with arbitrarily split moves. We
design several variations of the algorithm and try to measure the impact of
split moves separately on efficiency, quality of MCTS, simulations, and
action-based heuristics. The tests are carried out on a set of board games and
performed using the Regular Boardgames General Game Playing formalism, where
split strategies of different granularity can be automatically derived based on
an abstract description of the game. The results give an overview of the
behavior of agents using split design in different ways. We conclude that split
design can be greatly beneficial for single- as well as multi-action games.

show the $\alpha \rightarrow \omega$, $\omega \rightarrow \beta$, as well as
reverse $\beta \rightarrow \omega$ phase transitions. Simulations with a
multi-phase equation of state and phenomenological kinetic model match the
experimental wave profiles well. While the dynamic $\alpha \rightarrow \omega$
transition occurs $\sim 9$ GPa above the equilibrium phase boundary, the
$\omega \rightarrow \beta$ transition occurs within 0.9~GPa of equilibrium. We
estimate that the dynamic compression path intersects the equilibrium $\omega -
\beta$ line at $P= 29.2$ GPa, and $T = 490$ K. The thermodynamic path in the
interior of the sample lies $\sim 100$ K above the isentrope at the point of
the $\omega \rightarrow \beta$ transition. Approximately half of this
dissipative temperature rise is due to plastic work, and half is due to the
non-equilibrium $\alpha \rightarrow \omega$ transition. The inferred rate of
the $\alpha \rightarrow \omega$ transition is several orders of magnitude
higher than that measured in dynamic diamond anvil cell (DDAC) experiments in
an overlapping pressure range. We discuss a model for the influence of shear
stress on the nucleation rate. The small fractional volume change $\Delta V/V
\approx 0.1$ at the $\alpha \rightarrow \omega$ transition amplifies the effect
of shear stress, and we estimate that for this case shear stress is equivalent
to a pressure increase in the range of several GPa. Correcting our transition
rate to a hydrostatic rate brings it approximately into line with the DDAC
results, suggesting that shear stress plays a significant role in the
transformation rate.

We explore a strategy for how the Schwarzschild and mass precessions
can be separated from each other despite their secular interference, by
pinpointing their signatures within a single orbit. From these insights, we
then seek to assess the prospects for improving the dark mass constraints in
the coming years.
  Methods. We analysed the dependence of the osculating orbital elements and of
the observables on true anomaly, and we compared these functions for models
with and without extended mass. We then translated the maximum astrometric
impacts within one orbit to detection thresholds given hypothetical data of
different accuracies. These theoretical investigations were then supported and
complemented by an extensive mock-data fitting analysis.
  Results. We have four main results. 1. While the mass precession almost
exclusively impacts the orbit in the apocentre half, the Schwarzschild
precession almost exclusively impacts it in the pericentre half, allowing for a
clear separation of the effects. 2. Data that are limited to the pericentre
half are not sensitive to a dark mass, while data limited to the apocentre half
are, but only to a limited extent. 3. A full orbit of data is required to
substantially constrain a dark mass. 4. For a full orbit of astrometric and
spectroscopic data, the astrometric component in the pericentre half plays the
stronger role in constraining the dark mass than the astrometric data in the
apocentre half. Furthermore, we determine the 1{\sigma} dark mass detection
thresholds given different datasets on one full orbit. In particular, with a
full orbit of data of 50 microarcseconds (VLTI/GRAVITY) and 10 km/s
(VLT/SINFONI) precision, the 1{\sigma} bound would improve to about 1000 solar
masses, for example.

interdigitation zone (IZ) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were determined.
Comparative OCT analysis of central fovea, parafovea and perifovea were
implemented to verify the photoreceptor abnormality is rod predominated in
early DR. Results: Length abnormalities between the ISe and IZ also showed a
decreasing trend among cohorts. Reflectance abnormalities of the ELM, IZ and
ISe were observed between healthy, NoDR, and Mild DR eyes. The normalized
ISe/RPE intensity ratio revealed a significant decreasing trend in the
perifovea, but no detectable difference in central fovea. Conclusions:
Quantitative OCT analysis consistently revealed outer retina, i.e.,
photoreceptor, changes in diabetic patients with NoDR and mild DR. Comparative
analysis of central fovea, parafovea and perifovea confirmed the photoreceptor
abnormality is rod predominated in early DR.

climate performance. With investors increasingly looking to integrate climate
risk into their investment strategies and risk reporting, this creates demand
for robust prediction models that can generate reliable estimates for missing
carbon disclosures. However, these estimates lack transparency and are
frequently used in the investment decisions process with the same confidence as
corporate reported data. As disclosures remain mostly voluntary and the
propensity to disclose is shaped by several factors (e.g. size, sector,
geography), missing emissions data should be assumed to be missing not at
random (MNAR). However, widely used estimation methods (e.g. linear regression
models) typically do not correct for MNAR bias and do not accurately reflect
the uncertainty of estimated data. The objective of this paper is to address
these issues: (1) account for the uncertainty of the missing data and thus
obtain regression coefficients by multiple imputation (MI) (2) correct for
potential bias by using MI algorithms based on Heckman's sample selection model
introduced by Galimard et al. (3) estimate missing carbon disclosures with
linear models based on MI and report on the uncertainty of predicted values,
measured as the length of the prediction interval. In the simulation, our
approach resulted in an accuracy gain based on root mean squared error of up to
30%, and up to a 40% higher coverage rate than the existing models. When
applied to commercial data, the results suggested up to 20% higher coverage for

geometry when it's more likely to interfere with the ego-agent's motion
trajectory. However, current detection metrics, based on box
Intersection-over-Union (IoU), are object-centric and aren't designed to
capture the spatio-temporal relationship between objects and the ego-agent. To
address this issue, we propose a new egocentric measure to evaluate 3D object
detection, namely Support Distance Error (SDE). Our analysis based on SDE
reveals that the egocentric detection quality is bounded by the coarse geometry
of the bounding boxes. Given the insight that SDE would benefit from more
accurate geometry descriptions, we propose to represent objects as amodal
contours, specifically amodal star-shaped polygons, and devise a simple model,
StarPoly, to predict such contours. Our experiments on the large-scale Waymo
Open Dataset show that SDE better reflects the impact of detection quality on
the ego-agent's safety compared to IoU; and the estimated contours from
StarPoly consistently improve the egocentric detection quality over recent 3D

observations. They are about one magnitude fainter than those found using the
SDSS single-epoch data. The spectroscopic observations were conducted by the
SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) as one of the BOSS
ancillary programs. This quasar sample reaches $i\sim21.5$ mag and bridges
previous samples from brighter surveys and deeper surveys. We use a
$1/V_\mathrm{a}$ method to derive binned QLFs at $3.6<z<4.0$, $4.0<z<4.5$, and
$4.5<z<4.9$, and use a double-power law model to parameterize the QLFs. We also
combine our data with those in the literature to better constrain the QLFs in
the context of a much wider luminosity baseline. We find that the faint-end and
bright-end slopes of the QLFs in this redshift range are around $-1.7$ and
$-3.7$, respectively, with uncertainties from 0.2$-$0.3 to $>0.5$. The
evolution of the QLFs from $z\sim5$ to $3.5$ can be described by a pure density
evolution model ($\propto10^{kz}$) and the parameter $k$ is similar to that at
$5<z<7$, suggesting a nearly uniform evolution of the quasar density at

decade. Yet, these models often struggle with simultaneously addressing three
key requirements including: high sample quality, mode coverage, and fast
sampling. We call the challenge imposed by these requirements the generative
learning trilemma, as the existing models often trade some of them for others.
Particularly, denoising diffusion models have shown impressive sample quality
and diversity, but their expensive sampling does not yet allow them to be
applied in many real-world applications. In this paper, we argue that slow
sampling in these models is fundamentally attributed to the Gaussian assumption
in the denoising step which is justified only for small step sizes. To enable
denoising with large steps, and hence, to reduce the total number of denoising
steps, we propose to model the denoising distribution using a complex
multimodal distribution. We introduce denoising diffusion generative
adversarial networks (denoising diffusion GANs) that model each denoising step
using a multimodal conditional GAN. Through extensive evaluations, we show that
denoising diffusion GANs obtain sample quality and diversity competitive with
original diffusion models while being 2000$\times$ faster on the CIFAR-10
dataset. Compared to traditional GANs, our model exhibits better mode coverage
and sample diversity. To the best of our knowledge, denoising diffusion GAN is
the first model that reduces sampling cost in diffusion models to an extent
that allows them to be applied to real-world applications inexpensively.

simultaneously allowing non-zero spatial curvature and anisotropic expansion on
top of it, viz., the An-$o\Lambda$CDM model. This is to test whether the latest
data support spatial flatness and/or isotropic expansion, and, if not, to
explore the roles of spatial curvature and expansion anisotropy (due to its
stiff fluid-like behavior) in addressing some of the cosmological tensions. We
first present the theoretical background and explicit mathematical construction
of An-$o\Lambda$CDM; combining the simplest anisotropic generalizations of the
RW spacetime, viz., the Bianchi type I, V, and IX spacetimes. Then we constrain
this model and its particular cases, viz., An-$\Lambda$CDM, $o\Lambda$CDM, and
$\Lambda$CDM, by using the data sets from different probes, viz., Planck
CMB(+Lens), BAO, SnIa Pantheon, and CC data, and discuss the results.
Ultimately, we conclude that, within the setup under consideration, (i) the
data confirm the spatial flatness and isotropic expansion, though a very small
amount of present-day expansion anisotropy cannot be excluded, e.g.,
$\Omega_{\sigma0}\lesssim10^{-18}$ (95\% C.L.) for An-$\Lambda$CDM from
CMB+Lens, (ii) the introduction of spatial curvature or anisotropic expansion,
or both, on top $\Lambda$CDM does not offer a possible relaxation to the $H_0$
tension, and (iii) the introduction of anisotropic expansion neither affects
the closed space prediction from CMB(+Lens) nor does it improve the drastically
reduced value of $H_0$ led by the closed space. We discuss why it is important
and indispensable to maintain the geometric generalization work program,
especially in models that offer solutions to cosmological tensions. [abridged]

quantify the impact of the current rapid extinction of species on the

removes species but also the branches of the tree on which unique features
shared by the extinct species arose. In this paper, we investigate three
questions that are relevant to PD. The first asks how many sets of species of
given size $k$ preserve the maximum possible amount of PD in a given tree. The
number of such maximum PD sets can be very large, even for moderate-sized
phylogenies. We provide a combinatorial characterisation of maximum PD sets,
focusing on the setting where the branch lengths are ultrametric (e.g.
proportional to time). This leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for
calculating the number of maximum PD sets of size $k$ by applying a generating
function; we also investigate the types of tree shapes that harbour the most
(or fewest) maximum PD sets of size $k$. Our second question concerns
optimising a linear function on the species (regarded as leaves of the
phylogenetic tree) across all the maximum PD sets of a given size. Using the
characterisation result from the first question, we show how this optimisation
problem can be solved in polynomial time, even though the number of maximum PD
sets can grow exponentially. Our third question considers a dual problem: If
$k$ species were to become extinct, then what is the largest possible {\em
loss} of PD in the resulting tree? For this question, we describe a
polynomial-time solution based on dynamical programming.

which reflects a finite waiting time probability density. Firstly, we analyse
the solution of a tempered benchmark problem, which shows a weak singularity
near the initial time. The L1 scheme on graded mesh and the WSGL formula with
correction terms are adapted to deal with the non-smooth solution, in which we
compare these two methods systematically in terms of the convergence and
consumed CPU time. Furthermore, a fast calculation for the time tempered Caputo
fractional derivative is developed based on a sum-of-exponentials
approximation, which significantly reduces the running time. Moreover, the
tempered operator is applied to the Bloch equation in nuclear magnetic
resonance and a two-layered problem with composite material exhibiting distinct
memory effects, for which both the analytical (or semi-analytical) and
numerical solutions are derived using transform techniques and finite
difference methods. Data fitting results verify that the tempered
time-fractional model is much effective to describe the MRI data. An important
finding is that, compared with the fractional index, the tempered operator

environments. We understand well how they use lateral body bending to push
against asperities on flat ground for propulsion, and snake robots are already
effective in this. Recent studies revealed that snakes also use vertical
bending to push against uneven terrain of large height variation for propulsion
and can adjust vertical bending to adapt to novel terrain, presumably using
mechano-sensing feedback control. Although some snake robots can move through
uneven terrain, few have deliberately used vertical bending for propulsion,
largely because how to control vertical bending to generate propulsion against
the environment is poorly understood. To make progress, here we systematically
studied a snake robot with force sensors traversing large obstacles using
vertical bending. To test whether and how well sensory feedback control helps
adapt to perturbations, we compared a feedforward and three feedback
controllers that generate distinct bending patterns and body-terrain
interactions. To test whether and how well each controller adapts to various
perturbations, we challenged the robot with various perturbations that break
its contact with the terrain. Using feedforward propagation of a vertical
bending shape, the robot could generate large propulsion when its bending shape
conformed to the terrain. However, when contact was lost under perturbations,
the robot easily lost propulsion and overloaded its motors. Contact feedback
control helped the robot maintain propulsion by regaining contact. Unlike
propulsion generation using lateral bending, during propulsion generation using
vertical bending weight can help maintain contact with the environment but may
overload actuators. Our findings advanced our understanding of how snakes
slither in the 3-D world and will help snake robots better traverse complex 3-D
terrain.

methods to incorporate behavioral responses to the spread of a disease such as
social distancing and adoption of prevention methods. Mobility plays an
important role in epidemic dynamics and is also affected by behavioral changes,
but there are many situations in which real mobility data is incomplete or
inaccessible. We present a model for epidemic spreading in temporal networks of
mobile agents that incorporates local behavioral responses. Susceptible agents
are allowed to move towards the opposite direction of infected agents in their
neighborhood. We show that this mechanism considerably decreases the stationary
prevalence when the spatial density of agents is low. However, for higher
densities, the mechanism causes an abrupt phase transition, where a new
bistable phase appears. We develop a semi-analytic approach for the case when
the mobility is fast compared to the disease dynamics, and use it to argue that
the bistability is caused by the emergence of spatial clusters of susceptible
agents. Finally, we characterize the temporal networks formed in the fast
mobility regime, showing how the degree distributions and other metrics are
affected by the behavioral mechanism. Our work incorporates results previously
known from adaptive networks into the population of mobile agents, which can be
further developed to be used in mobility-driven models.

Dirichlet boundary conditions on a part of the boundary and a slip fluid-solid

However, conventional data-driven methods require large amounts of transient
data to correctly assess the transient stability state of a system. In this
paper, a new data-driven TSA approach is developed for TSA with fewer data
compared to the conventional methods. The data reduction is enabled by learning
the dynamic behaviors of the historical transient data using generative and
adversarial networks (GAN). This knowledge is used online to predict the
voltage time series data after a transient event. A classifier embedded in the
generative network deploys the predicted post-contingency data to determine the
stability of the system following a fault. The developed GAN-based TSA approach
preserves the spatial and temporal correlations that exist in multivariate PMU
time series data. Hence, in comparison with the state-of-the-art TSA methods,
it achieves a higher assessment accuracy using only one sample of the measured

the critical current of a 2D superconductor is expected to depend on the
directions of current flow. Such nonreciprocal behavior in superconducting
transport, which creates a superconducting diode, has recently been
demonstrated experimentally by breaking these symmetries with an applied
magnetic field \cite{Ando2020diodes} or by construction of a magnetic tunnel
junction \cite{Diez2021magnetic}. Here we report an intrinsic superconducting
diode effect which is present at zero external magnetic field in mirror
symmetric twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG). Such nonreciprocal behavior, with
sign that can be reversed through training with an out-of-plane magnetic field,
provides direct evidence of the microscopic coexistence between
superconductivity and time-reversal symmetry breaking. In addition to the
magnetic-field trainability, we show that the zero-field diode effect can be
controlled by varying carrier density or twist angle. In accordance with these
experimental controls, a natural interpretation for the origin of the intrinsic
diode effect is an imbalance in valley occupation of the underlying Fermi
surface, which likely leads to finite-momentum Cooper pairing and nematicity in
the superconducting phase.

HyObscure are also provided in theory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
HyObscure significantly outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art baseline

$5f$-electron systems. The model is composed by two narrow $f$-bands (of either
$\alpha$ or $\beta$ character) that hybridize with a wide $d$-band and local
$5f$-electron interactions. We consider both cubic and tetragonal lattices. The
N\'eel order parameters $\phi^{\beta}$ and $\phi^{\alpha}$ are assumed to be
fixed by an Ising anisotropy. The applied magnetic field $h_z$ is parallel to
the anisotropy axis. It has been assumed that the variation of the band width
$W$ is sensitive to pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, the increase
of $W$ takes the system from the phase AF$_1$ to another phase AF$_2$. The
phase AF$_1$ occurs when $\phi^{\beta}>\phi^{\alpha}>0$ while in the AF$_2$
phase the gaps satisfy $\phi^{\alpha}>\phi^{\beta}>0$. In the presence of a
magnetic field $h_z$, the phase AF$_2$ is quickly suppressed and reappears
again at intermediate values of the magnetic field while it is predominant at
higher magnetic fields. The analysis of the partial density of states close to
the phase transition between the phases AF$_1$ and AF$_2$, allows a better
understanding the mechanism responsible whereby the transition is induced by an
increase in the magnetic field. As a important general result, we found that
the magnetic field $h_z$ favours the phase AF$_2$ while the phase AF$_1$ is
suppressed. For the tetragonal lattice, the phase AF$_2$ is even more favored
when $h_z$ and $c/a$ increases concomitantly, where $c$ and $a$ are the lattice
parameters.

has allowed dramatic improvements in weather forecasting over the past few
decades. DA is commonly framed in a variational setting, where one solves an
optimization problem within a Bayesian formulation using raw model forecasts as
a prior, and observations as likelihood. This leads to a DA objective function
that needs to be minimized, where the decision variables are the initial
conditions specified to the model. In traditional DA, the forward model is
numerically and computationally expensive. Here we replace the forward model
with a low-dimensional, data-driven, and differentiable emulator. Consequently,
gradients of our DA objective function with respect to the decision variables
are obtained rapidly via automatic differentiation. We demonstrate our approach
by performing an emulator-assisted DA forecast of geopotential height. Our
results indicate that emulator-assisted DA is faster than traditional
equation-based DA forecasts by four orders of magnitude, allowing computations
to be performed on a workstation rather than a dedicated high-performance

process but the conditional intensity process supports a spatial domain. It
empowers the main-shock intensity with the capability to reset upon the arrival
of main-shocks and therefore allows for heavier clustering of earthquakes than
the spatiotemporal ETAS model introduced by Ogata (1998). We introduce a
likelihood evaluation algorithm for parameter estimation and provide a novel
procedure to evaluated the fitted model's goodness-of-fit based on a sequential
application of the Rosenblatt transformation. A simulation algorithm for the
RETAS model is developed and applied to validate the numerical performance of
the likelihood evaluation algorithm and goodness of fit test procedure. We
illustrate the proposed model and procedures on various earthquake catalogs
around the world each with distinctly different seismic activity. These
catalogs will demonstrate that the RETAS model affords additional flexibility
in comparison to the classical spatiotemporal ETAS model and has the potential
for superior modeling and forecasting of seismicity.

pair $(\A,\B)$, where $\A = \L - \mu \Q + \epsilon \I$ is a sum of graph
Laplacian $\L$ and disconnected two-hop difference matrix $\Q$. Eigenvector
$\v$ minimizing Rayleigh quotient $\frac{\v^{\top} \A \v}{\v^{\top} \v}$ thus
minimizes $1$-hop neighbor distances while maximizing distances between
disconnected $2$-hop neighbors, preserving graph structure. Matrix $\B =

that boundary / interior nodes in the sampling domain have the same generalized
degrees. $K$-dimensional latent vectors for the $N$ graph nodes are the first

dynamics. The characteristic frequency scale that governs the approximation is
the minimax frequency: the minimum of the maximum system oscillation frequency
and the bath relaxation rate; this needs to be larger than the dissipation rate
for it to be valid. The concepts are illustrated on the Heisenberg
ferromagnetic spin-chain model. To study the accuracy of the approximation, a
Hamiltonian is drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble, for which we calculate
the fourth order time convolutionless master equation, in the Ohmic bath at
zero temperature. Enforcing the geometric average, decreases the trace distance
to the exact solution. Dynamical decoupling of a qubit is examined by applying
the Redfield and the geometric-arithmetic master equations, in the interaction
picture of the time dependent system Hamiltonian, and the results are compared
to the exact path integral solution. The geometric-arithmetic approach is
significantly simpler and can be super-exponentially faster compared to the

this subset of labeled exemplars, the query text to be classified, a definition

similar and sometimes superior accuracy to fine-tuned models. We observe that
the largest 530B parameter model is significantly more effective in detecting
social bias compared to smaller models (achieving at least 13% improvement in

less than 2%) when the labeled repository is reduced to as few as $100$

practitioners is to stay abreast with the rapid growth of publications and
medical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) has emerged as a promising
direction for taming information overload. In particular, large neural language
models facilitate transfer learning by pretraining on unlabeled text, as
exemplified by the successes of BERT models in various NLP applications.
However, fine-tuning such models for an end task remains challenging,
especially with small labeled datasets, which are common in biomedical NLP.
  Results: We conduct a systematic study on fine-tuning stability in biomedical
NLP. We show that finetuning performance may be sensitive to pretraining
settings, especially in low-resource domains. Large models have potential to
attain better performance, but increasing model size also exacerbates
finetuning instability. We thus conduct a comprehensive exploration of
techniques for addressing fine-tuning instability. We show that these
techniques can substantially improve fine-tuning performance for lowresource
biomedical NLP applications. Specifically, freezing lower layers is helpful for
standard BERT-BASE models, while layerwise decay is more effective for
BERT-LARGE and ELECTRA models. For low-resource text similarity tasks such as
BIOSSES, reinitializing the top layer is the optimal strategy. Overall,
domainspecific vocabulary and pretraining facilitate more robust models for
fine-tuning. Based on these findings, we establish new state of the art on a
wide range of biomedical NLP applications.

release our state-of-the-art pretrained and fine-tuned models:

By comparing various properties, including galaxy conditional luminosity
function, stellar population, active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, and X-ray
luminosity of the intra-cluster medium of carefully controlled high (HC) and
low compactness (LC) group samples, we find that the group compactness plays an
essential role in characterizing the detailed physical properties of the group
themselves and their group members, especially for low mass groups with $M_h
\lesssim 10^{13.5}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. We find that the low-mass HC groups have a
systematically lower magnitude gap $\Delta m_{12}$ and X-ray luminosity than
their LC counterparts, indicating that the HC groups are probably in the early
stage of group merging. On the other hand, a higher fraction of passive
galaxies is found in the HC group, which however is a result of systematically
smaller halo-centric distance distribution of their satellite population. After
controlling of both $M_h$ and halo-centric distance, we do not find any
differences for both the quenching faction and AGN activity of the member

by adversaries. Tracing text provenance can help claim the ownership of text
content or identify the malicious users who distribute misleading content like
machine-generated fake news. There have been some attempts to achieve this,
mainly based on watermarking techniques. Specifically, traditional text
watermarking methods embed watermarks by slightly altering text format like
line spacing and font, which, however, are fragile to cross-media transmissions
like OCR. Considering this, natural language watermarking methods represent
watermarks by replacing words in original sentences with synonyms from
handcrafted lexical resources (e.g., WordNet), but they do not consider the
substitution's impact on the overall sentence's meaning. Recently, a
transformer-based network was proposed to embed watermarks by modifying the
unobtrusive words (e.g., function words), which also impair the sentence's
logical and semantic coherence. Besides, one well-trained network fails on
other different types of text content. To address the limitations mentioned
above, we propose a natural language watermarking scheme based on context-aware
lexical substitution (LS). Specifically, we employ BERT to suggest LS
candidates by inferring the semantic relatedness between the candidates and the
original sentence. Based on this, a selection strategy in terms of
synchronicity and substitutability is further designed to test whether a word
is exactly suitable for carrying the watermark signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, under both objective and subjective metrics, our watermarking
scheme can well preserve the semantic integrity of original sentences and has a
better transferability than existing methods. Besides, the proposed LS approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art approach on the Stanford Word Substitution
Benchmark.

when the maximum impactor size that leads to an aerial burst rather than a
ground explosion, $r_o$, is larger than the minimum impactor size needed to
achieve atmospheric loss, $r_{min}$. For vertical trajectories, which give the
most stringent limit, this condition is approximately satisfied when
$\rho_o/\rho_i \gtrsim 0.4 v_e/v_\infty$, which implies atmospheric densities
need to be comparable to impactor densities for impactor velocities that are a
few times the escape velocity of the planet. The range of impactor radii
resulting in aerial burst-induced mass loss, $r_o-r_{min}$, increases with the
ratio of the atmosphere to the impactor density and with the trajectory angle
of the impactor. The range of impactor radii that result in aerial
burst-induced mass loss and the atmospheric mass lost is larger in adiabatic
atmospheres than isothermal atmospheres of equivalent total mass, scale height,
and atmospheric surface density. Our results imply that aerial bursts are not
expected to significantly contribute to the atmospheric mass-loss history of
Earth, but are expected to play an important role for planets and exoplanets
similar to Neptune with significant atmospheres. For Neptune-like atmospheres,
the atmospheric mass ejected per impactor mass by aerial bursts is comparable
to that lost by ground explosions, which implies that, for impactors following
a Dohnanyi size distribution, overall loss by aerial busts is expected to
exceed that by ground explosions by a factor of

of GC for any given set of metrics. By distilling out the explicitly
identifiable GC cost, we estimate the intrinsic application execution cost
using different GCs. The minimum distilled cost forms a baseline. Subtracting
this baseline from the total execution costs, we can then place an empirical
lower bound on the absolute costs of different GCs. Using this methodology, we
study five production GCs in OpenJDK 17, a high-performance Java runtime. We
measure the cost of these collectors, and expose their respective key
performance tradeoffs. We find that with a modestly sized heap, production GCs
incur substantial overheads across a diverse suite of modern benchmarks,
spending at least 7-82% more wall-clock time and 6-92% more CPU cycles relative
to the baseline cost. We show that these costs can be masked by concurrency and
generous provisioning of memory/compute. In addition, we find that newer
low-pause GCs are significantly more expensive than older GCs, and,
surprisingly, sometimes deliver worse application latency than stop-the-world
GCs. Our findings reaffirm that GC is by no means a solved problem and that a
low-cost, low-latency GC remains elusive. We recommend adopting the
distillation methodology together with a wider range of cost metrics for future
GC evaluations.

a paradigm of Schr\""odinger-Heisenberg variational quantum algorithms to
resolve this problem. We choose a Clifford virtual circuit, whose effect on the

realizing much larger unitary t-designs. Our method enables accurate quantum
simulation and computation that otherwise is only achievable with much deeper

numerical experiments for a better approximation of random states and a
higher-fidelity solution to the ground state energy of the XXZ model. Together
with effective quantum error mitigation, our work paves the way for realizing
accurate quantum computing algorithms with near-term quantum devices.

paper, we investigate planar instability in directional solidification.
Firstly, the interfacial evolution at the initial growth stage is simulated,
indicating the planar instability is represented by the transition from the
planar to the cellular. Secondly, to represent the history-dependence of
solidification, constant thermal gradient G and varying pulling speed VP are
used in the simulations. The results indicate the cooling rate R ( = G*VP)
dominates the overall propagation speed of the interface, to maintain the local
thermodynamic equilibrium. The solute segregation determines the stability of
the interface, by changing the excess free energy at the interface and
corresponding interface energy. Finally, the simulations of the grains with
different preferred crystallographic orientations are performed, indicating the
surface energy and its anisotropy do not affect the solute diffusion and planar
growth. The results also verify the conclusion that solute segregation
influences the interface energy and results in interface instability. On the
other hand, for the planar-cellular transition, the minimum surface stiffness
rule is more suitable than the maximum surface energy rule. The influence of
the solute concentration on the excess free energy and interface energy can be
applied to other solidification patterns induced by the interface instability,

Our approach uses a single model for source separation of multiple sound types,
and relies solely on weakly-labeled data for training. In addition, the
proposed audio separator can be used in a zero-shot setting, learning to
separate types of audio sources that were never seen in training. To evaluate
the separation performance, we test our model on MUSDB18, while training on the

generalize to other domains for retrieval tasks. One widespread belief is that
the bottleneck layer of a dual encoder, where the final score is simply a
dot-product between a query vector and a passage vector, is too limited to make
dual encoders an effective retrieval model for out-of-domain generalization. In
this paper, we challenge this belief by scaling up the size of the dual encoder
model {\em while keeping the bottleneck embedding size fixed.} With multi-stage
training, surprisingly, scaling up the model size brings significant
improvement on a variety of retrieval tasks, especially for out-of-domain
generalization. Experimental results show that our dual encoders,

outperform %ColBERT~\cite{khattab2020colbert} and existing sparse and dense

surprisingly, our ablation study finds that GTR is very data efficient, as it

large obstacles, such as self-driving, search and rescue, and extraterrestrial
exploration. Although robots are already excellent at avoiding sparse
obstacles, they still struggle in traversing cluttered large obstacles. To make
progress, we need to better understand how to use and control the physical
interaction with obstacles to traverse them. Forest floor-dwelling cockroaches
can use physical interaction to transition between different locomotor modes to
traverse flexible, grass-like beams of a large range of stiffness. Inspired by
this, here we studied whether and how environmental force sensing helps robots
make active adjustments to traverse cluttered large obstacles. We developed a
physics model and a simulation of a minimalistic robot capable of sensing
environmental forces during traversal of beam obstacles. Then, we developed a
force-feedback control strategy, which estimated beam stiffness from the sensed
contact force using the physics model. Then in simulation we used the estimated
stiffness to control the robot to either stay in or transition to the more
favorable locomotor modes to traverse. When beams were stiff, force sensing
induced the robot to transition from a more costly pitch mode to a less costly
roll mode, which helped the robot traverse with a higher success rate and less
energy consumed. By contrast, if the robot simply pushed forward or always
avoided obstacles, it would consume more energy, become stuck in front of
beams, or even flip over. When the beams were flimsy, force sensing guided the
robot to simply push across the beams. In addition, we demonstrated the
robustness of beam stiffness estimation against body oscillations, randomness
in oscillation, and uncertainty in position sensing. We also found that a
shorter sensorimotor delay reduced energy cost of traversal.

low-power wearable devices due to energy and memory constraints. Therefore, in
this paper, we present a novel and energy-efficient methodology for

methodology is composed of three different layers: 1) a Noise/Artifact
detection layer to grade the quality of the ECG signals; 2) a Normal/Abnormal
beat classification layer to detect the anomalies in the ECG signals, and 3) an
Abnormal beat classification layer to detect diseases from ECG signals.
Moreover, a distributed multi-output Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture is used to decrease the energy consumption and latency between the
edge-fog/cloud. Our methodology reaches an accuracy of 99.2% on the well-known
MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset. Evaluation on real hardware shows that our
methodology is suitable for devices having a minimum RAM of 32KB. Moreover, the

robotics, visual servoing, and visual SLAM. Although the previous planar
trackers work well in most scenarios, it is still a challenging task due to the
rapid motion and large transformation between two consecutive frames. The
essential reason behind this problem is that the condition number of such a
non-linear system changes unstably when the searching range of the homography
parameter space becomes larger. To this end, we propose a novel Homography
Decomposition Networks(HDN) approach that drastically reduces and stabilizes
the condition number by decomposing the homography transformation into two
groups. Specifically, a similarity transformation estimator is designed to
predict the first group robustly by a deep convolution equivariant network. By
taking advantage of the scale and rotation estimation with high confidence, a
residual transformation is estimated by a simple regression model. Furthermore,
the proposed end-to-end network is trained in a semi-supervised fashion.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art planar tracking methods at a large margin on the challenging

that have not been seen in the training. Existing works formulate ZS3 as a
pixel-level zeroshot classification problem, and transfer semantic knowledge
from seen classes to unseen ones with the help of language models pre-trained
only with texts. While simple, the pixel-level ZS3 formulation shows the
limited capability to integrate vision-language models that are often
pre-trained with image-text pairs and currently demonstrate great potential for
vision tasks. Inspired by the observation that humans often perform
segment-level semantic labeling, we propose to decouple the ZS3 into two
sub-tasks: 1) a classagnostic grouping task to group the pixels into segments.
2) a zero-shot classification task on segments. The former task does not
involve category information and can be directly transferred to group pixels
for unseen classes. The latter task performs at segment-level and provides a
natural way to leverage large-scale vision-language models pre-trained with
image-text pairs (e.g. CLIP) for ZS3. Based on the decoupling formulation, we
propose a simple and effective zero-shot semantic segmentation model, called
ZegFormer, which outperforms the previous methods on ZS3 standard benchmarks by

loss of edge information of segmented objects and background may occur. This
paper proposes an improved structure of a semantic segmentation network based
on a deep learning network that combines self-attention neural network and
neural network architecture search methods. First, a neural network search
method NAS (Neural Architecture Search) is used to find a semantic segmentation
network with multiple resolution branches. In the search process, combine the
self-attention network structure module to adjust the searched neural network
structure, and then combine the semantic segmentation network searched by
different branches to form a fast semantic segmentation network structure, and
input the picture into the network structure to get the final forecast result.
The experimental results on the Cityscapes dataset show that the accuracy of
the algorithm is 69.8%, and the segmentation speed is 48/s. It achieves a good
balance between real-time and accuracy, can optimize edge segmentation, and has

To benchmark algorithms in the field of machine learning and neuroimaging in
dementia and assess their potential for use in clinical practice and clinical
trials, seven grand challenges have been organized in the last decade.
  The seven grand challenges addressed questions related to screening, clinical
status estimation, prediction and monitoring in (pre-clinical) dementia. There
was little overlap in clinical questions, tasks and performance metrics.
Whereas this aids providing insight on a broad range of questions, it also
limits the validation of results across challenges. The validation process
itself was mostly comparable between challenges, using similar methods for
ensuring objective comparison, uncertainty estimation and statistical testing.
In general, winning algorithms performed rigorous data preprocessing and
combined a wide range of input features.
  Despite high state-of-the-art performances, most of the methods evaluated by
the challenges are not clinically used. To increase impact, future challenges
could pay more attention to statistical analysis of which factors relate to
higher performance, to clinical questions beyond Alzheimer's disease, and to
using testing data beyond the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
Grand challenges would be an ideal venue for assessing the generalizability of
algorithm performance to unseen data of other cohorts. Key for increasing
impact in this way are larger testing data sizes, which could be reached by
sharing algorithms rather than data to exploit data that cannot be shared.

statistically biased order rather than in uniformly random order. The bias is
given by the left-to-right-minimum exponentially tilted distribution with
parameter $q\in(0,\infty)$. That is, for $\sigma\in S_n$, $P_n(\sigma)$ is
proportional to $q^{\text{LR}^{-}_n(\sigma)}$, where the left-to-right minimum
statistic $\text{LR}^-_n$ is defined by $$ \text{LR}^{-}_n(\sigma)=|\{j\in[n]:
\sigma_j=\min\{\sigma_i:1\le i\le j\}\}|,\ \sigma\in S_n. $$ For $q\in(0,1)$,
higher ranked items tend to arrive earlier than in the case of the uniform
distribution, and for $q\in(1,\infty)$, they tend to arrive later. In the
classical problem, the asymptotically optimal strategy is to reject the first
$M_n^*$ items, where $M_n^*\sim\frac ne$, and then to select the first item
ranked higher than any of the first $M_n^*$ items (if such an item exists).
This yields $e^{-1}$ as the limiting probability of success. With the above
bias on arrivals, we calculate the asymptotic behavior of the optimal strategy
$M_n^*$ and the corresponding limiting probability of success, for all regimes
of $\{q_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$. In particular, if the leading order asymptotic
behavior of $\{q_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is at least $\frac1{\log n}$, and if also
its order is no more than $o(n)$, then the limiting probability of success when
using an asymptotically optimal strategy is $e^{-1}$; otherwise, this limiting
probability of success is greater than $e^{-1}$. Also, the limiting fraction of

asymptotically optimal strategy lies in $(0,1)$ if and only if
$\lim_{n\to\infty}q_n\in(0,\infty)$.

also provides the more high-quality graph information. Meanwhile, GRCCA further
excavates cluster-level information, which make it get insight to the elusive

normalizing constants depending upon the parameters are known as doubly
intractable posterior distributions. The terminology itself indicates that
obtaining Bayesian inference from such posteriors is doubly difficult compared
to traditional intractable posteriors where the normalizing constants are
tractable and admit traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) solutions.
  As can be anticipated, a plethora of MCMC-based methods have originated in
the literature to deal with doubly intractable distributions. Yet, it remains
very much unclear if any of the methods can satisfactorily sample from such
posteriors, particularly in high-dimensional setups.
  In this article, we consider efficient Monte Carlo and importance sampling
approximations of the intractable normalizing constant for a few values of the
parameters, and Gaussian process interpolations for the remaining values of the
parameters, using the approximations. We then incorporate this strategy within
the exact iid sampling framework developed in Bhattacharya (2021a) and
Bhattacharya (2021b), and illustrate the methodology with simulation
experiments comprising a two-dimensional normal-gamma posterior, a
two-dimensional Ising model posterior, a two-dimensional Strauss process
posterior and a 100-dimensional autologistic model posterior. In each case we
demonstrate great accuracy of our methodology, which is also computationally
extremely efficient, often taking only a few minutes for generating 10, 000 iid
realizations on 80 processors.

stochastic Markov games with countable state spaces and discounted cost
criteria. In one-player case, i.e., constrained discounted Markov decision
models, it is possible to formulate a static optimisation problem whose
solution determines a stationary optimal strategy (alias control or policy) in
the dynamical infinite horizon model. This solution lies in the compact convex
set of all occupation measures induced by strategies, defined on the set of
state-action pairs. In case of n-person discounted games the occupation
measures are induced by strategies of all players. Therefore, it is difficult
to generalise the approach for constrained discounted Markov decision processes
directly. It is not clear how to define the domain for the best-response
correspondence whose fixed point induces a stationary equilibrium in the Markov
game. This domain should be the Cartesian product of compact convex sets in
locally convex topological vector spaces. One of our main results shows how to
overcome this difficulty and define a constrained non-cooperative static game
whose Nash equilibrium induces by a stationary Nash equilibrium in the Markov
game. This is done for games with bounded cost functions and positive initial
state distribution. An extension to a class of Markov games with unbounded
costs and arbitrary initial state distribution relies on approximation of the
unbounded game by bounded ones with positive initial state distributions. In
the unbounded case, we assume the uniform integrability of the discounted costs
with respect to all probability measures induced by strategies of the players,
defined on the space of plays (histories) of the game. Our assumptions are
weaker than those applied in earlier works on discounted dynamic programming or
stochastic games using so-called weighted norm approaches.

engineering shape features such as holes, slots, etc. in a CAD mesh model. With
the advent of digital archiving, newer manufacturing techniques such as 3D
printing, scanning of components and reverse engineering, CAD data is
proliferated in the form of mesh model representation. As the number of nodes
and edges become larger in a mesh model as well as the possibility of presence
of noise, direct application of graph-based approaches would not only be
expensive but also difficult to be tuned for noisy data. Hence, this calls for
newer approaches to be devised for feature recognition for CAD models
represented in the form of mesh. Here, we show that a discrete version of Gauss
map can be used as a signature for a feature learning. We show that this
approach not only requires fewer memory requirements but also the training time
is quite less. As no network architecture is involved, the number of
hyperparameters are much lesser and can be tuned in a much faster time. The
recognition accuracy is also very similar to that of the one obtained using 3D
convolutional neural networks (CNN) but in much lesser running time and storage
requirements. A comparison has been done with other non-network based machine
learning approaches to show that our approach has the highest accuracy. We also
show the recognition results for CAD models having multiple features as well as
complex/interacting features obtained from public benchmarks. The ability to
handle noisy data has also been demonstrated.

characteristics: 1) the zero-shot setting requires a metric space with good
within-class compactness and the between-class discrepancy for recognizing the
novel classes and 2) the sketch query and the photo gallery are in different
modalities. The metric learning viewpoint benefits ZS-SBIR from two aspects.
First, it facilitates improvement through recent good practices in deep metric
learning (DML). By combining two fundamental learning approaches in DML, e.g.,
classification training and pairwise training, we set up a strong baseline for
ZS-SBIR. Without bells and whistles, this baseline achieves competitive
retrieval accuracy. Second, it provides an insight that properly suppressing
the modality gap is critical. To this end, we design a novel method named
Modality-Aware Triplet Hard Mining (MATHM). MATHM enhances the baseline with
three types of pairwise learning, e.g., a cross-modality sample pair, a
within-modality sample pair, and their combination.\We also design an adaptive
weighting method to balance these three components during training dynamically.
Experimental results confirm that MATHM brings another round of significant
improvement based on the strong baseline and sets up new state-of-the-art
performance. For example, on the TU-Berlin dataset, we achieve 47.88+2.94%

considerable attention due to the advantages provided by the caloric effect in
designing solid-state refrigeration technologies. The magneto-electrocaloric
effect of a multiferroic antiferromagnetic spin system with the Dzyaloshinskii
Moriya (DM) interaction is investigated in this paper. The DM interaction is
assimilated to a coupling between an external site-dependent electric field and
a local electric polarization. The external magnetic is also considered as a
site-dependent magnetic field. The spin-wave theory is used as a
diagonalization method and through the canonical partition function, some
thermodynamic properties such as the Boltzmann entropy and the specific heat
capacity are obtained. Then, the adiabatic magnetic, electric, and
magnetoelectric cooling rates are also derived. The graphs obtained for the
adiabatic magnetic, electric, and magnetoelectric cooling rate show a
characteristic behavior of the caloric or multi-caloric effect which is in good
agreement with some experimental and theoretical works. Besides, the entropy
response due to the variation of the external site-dependent magnetic field
exhibits two anomalous entropy peaks indicating the existence of an
intermediate phase tuneable by the magnetic and electric site-dependent
parameters. Overall, it is demonstrated that the cumulative influence of the
site-dependent magnetic and electric fields allows us not only to reveal
quantum critical points hidden in a multiferroic quantum spin system but also
to control the caloric or multi-caloric effect essential in the construction of
solid-state refrigeration devices.

dispersive and dissipative losses are analyzed both in the time and the
frequency domains. In the case of the time domain radiating system, the
parameter studied is the action, A, associated with the radiation. The action
is defined as the product of the energy and the duration of the radiation. In
the case of the frequency domain radiating system, which produces radiation in
bursts of duration T/2 where T is the period of oscillation, the parameter
studied is the energy, U, dissipated in a single burst of radiation of duration
T/2. In this paper, we have studied how A and U vary as a function of the
charge associated with the current in the radiating system and the ratio of the
length of the radiating system and its radius. We have observed remarkable
results when this ratio is equal to the ratio of the radius of the universe to
the Bohr radius. In the case of the time domain radiating system, we have
observed that when the charge associated with the current propagating along the
radiator reaches the electronic charge, the action associated with the
radiation reduces to h/2*pi where h is the Planck constant. In the case of the
frequency domain radiating system, we have observed that as the magnitude of
the oscillating charge reduces to the electronic charge, the energy dissipated
in a single burst of radiation reduces to h*v, where v is the frequency of
oscillation. Interestingly, all these results are based purely on classical
electrodynamics and general relativity. The importance of the findings is
discussed. In particular, the fact that the minimum free charge that exists in
nature is the electronic charge, is shown for the first time to be a direct
consequence of the photonic nature of the electromagnetic fields. Furthermore,
the presented findings allow to derive for the first time an expression for the
dark energy density of the universe in terms of the other fundamental constants
in nature, the prediction of which is consistent with experimental
observations. This Equation, which combines together the dark energy,
electronic charge and mass, speed of light, gravitational constant and Planck
constant, creates a link between classical field theories (i.e., classical
electrodynamics and general relativity) and quantum mechanics.

the corresponding stability analysis of these periodic flows to detect
secondary bifurcations giving rise to quasiperiodic modulated rotating waves

MRWs have multimodal nature involving resonant triads. The modes can be located

privacy, it becomes more and more difficult to share data among organizations.
Data federation brings new opportunities to the data-related cooperation among
organizations by providing abstract data interfaces. With the development of
cloud computing, organizations store data on the cloud to achieve elasticity
and scalability for data processing. The existing data placement approaches
generally only consider one aspect, which is either execution time or monetary
cost, and do not consider data partitioning for hard constraints. In this
paper, we propose an approach to enable data processing on the cloud with the
data from different organizations. The approach consists of a data federation
platform named FedCube and a Lyapunov-based data placement algorithm. FedCube
enables data processing on the cloud. We use the data placement algorithm to
create a plan in order to partition and store data on the cloud so as to
achieve multiple objectives while satisfying the constraints based on a
multi-objective cost model. The cost model is composed of two objectives, i.e.,
reducing monetary cost and execution time. We present an experimental
evaluation to show our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the total cost
(up to 69.8\%) compared with existing approaches.

mass spectrum from ATLAS and CMS, adding extra conditions, the most efficient
one being the presence of >90 GeV missing transverse energy. The claim is a ~5
s.d. excess at 151 GeV. The GM model naturally explains this as coming from the
cascade A(400)->H(151)Z, where H(151) is an isosinglet predicted by GM and
where the accompanying signal comes from the decay of a Z boson into neutrino
pairs. Satisfying the constraints from LHC measurements of the ZWW channel,
which can receive a large contribution from this cascade, suggests that H(151)
could dominantly decay into two light CP-odd scalars, following an ATLAS

Background Constraint concept can be easily plug-and-played into existing TAPG

prescription can be implemented in the presence of a scalar field. For
concreteness, we consider the model of Garay et al., in which the potential is
a sum of exponentials, and which lends itself to an analytical treatment.
Compared to the earlier implementation, we find that saddle points with
unstable fluctuations can be eliminated by imposition of an appropriate
regularity condition. This leads to the appearance of additional saddle points,
corresponding to unclosed geometries. We argue that such saddles will occur
generically, though we also find in our example that they are subdominant to
the closed, Hartle-Hawking, saddle points. When the potential is positive,
classical spacetime is only predicted for inflationary histories. When the
potential is negative, we recover the AdS gravitational path integral, with a
stable scalar field included. One puzzle that we find is that in general the
path integral must be restricted to sum only over specific, discrete and late
time dependent initial values of the scalar field. Only when the scalar is
required to take real values is this puzzle eliminated, a situation that
moreover leads to advantageous phenomenological characteristics.

Unfortunately, the traditional methods to grow PZT on Silicon are detrimental

Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic chip using an optically transparent buffer
layer. We demonstrate acousto-optic modulation in Silicon waveguides with the
PZT actuated acoustic waves. We fabricate inter digital transducers (IDTs) on
the PZT film with a contact photo-lithography and electron-beam lithography to
generate the acoustic waves in MHz and GHz range respectively. We obtain a
V$_{\pi}$L $\sim$ 3.35 V$\cdot$cm at 576 MHz from a 350 nm thick gold (Au) IDT

reflection into account, we measured a V$_{\pi}$L $\sim$ 3.60 V$\cdot$cm at 2

Thus, without patterning the PZT film nor suspending the device, we obtained
figures-of-merit comparable to state-of-the-art modulators based on SOI, making
it a promising candidate for broadband and efficient acousto-optic modulator
for future integration.

minimizing the reconstruction error. This defines a hierarchical optimization
problem, which can be cast as a bi-level optimization. Yet, this problem is
unsolvable, as reconstructions and their derivative wrt the dictionary have no
closed-form expression. However, reconstructions can be iteratively computed
using the Forward-Backward splitting (FB) algorithm. In this paper, we
approximate reconstructions by the output of the aforementioned FB algorithm.
Then, we leverage automatic differentiation to evaluate the gradient of this

allow localization of particle interactions through a process called
reconstruction. While multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have emerged as a leading
contender for reconstruction in TPCs, such a black-box approach does not
reflect prior knowledge of the underlying scientific processes. This paper
looks anew at neural network-based interaction localization and encodes prior
detector knowledge, in terms of both signal characteristics and detector
geometry, into the feature encoding and the output layers of a multilayer
neural network. The resulting Domain-informed Neural Network (DiNN) limits the
receptive fields of the neurons in the initial feature encoding layers in order
to account for the spatially localized nature of the signals produced within
the TPC. This aspect of the DiNN, which has similarities with the emerging area
of graph neural networks in that the neurons in the initial layers only connect
to a handful of neurons in their succeeding layer, significantly reduces the
number of parameters in the network in comparison to an MLP. In addition, in
order to account for the detector geometry, the output layers of the network
are modified using two geometric transformations to ensure the DiNN produces
localizations within the interior of the detector. The end result is a neural
network architecture that has 60% fewer parameters than an MLP, but that still
achieves similar localization performance and provides a path to future
architectural developments with improved performance because of their ability
to encode additional domain knowledge into the architecture.

global terrorism has been characterized by increasing operational cohesiveness.
Second, we highlight that year-to-year stability in co-clustering among groups
has been particularly high from 2009 to 2018, indicating temporal consistency
of similarity patterns in the last decade. Third, we demonstrate that
operational similarity between two organizations is driven by three factors:
(a) their overall activity; (b) the difference in the diversity of their
operational repertoires; (c) the difference in a combined measure of diversity
and activity. Groups' operational preferences, geographical homophily and
ideological affinity have no consistent role in determining operational
similarity.

in semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, training DNNs generally requires large
amounts of pixel-level labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to
collect in practice. To mitigate the annotation burden, this paper proposes a
self-ensembling generative adversarial network (SE-GAN) exploiting cross-domain
data for semantic segmentation. In SE-GAN, a teacher network and a student
network constitute a self-ensembling model for generating semantic segmentation
maps, which together with a discriminator, forms a GAN. Despite its simplicity,
we find SE-GAN can significantly boost the performance of adversarial training
and enhance the stability of the model, the latter of which is a common barrier
shared by most adversarial training-based methods. We theoretically analyze
SE-GAN and provide an $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{N})$ generalization bound ($N$ is the
training sample size), which suggests controlling the discriminator's
hypothesis complexity to enhance the generalizability. Accordingly, we choose a
simple network as the discriminator. Extensive and systematic experiments in
two standard settings demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. The source code of our model
is available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/SE-GAN).

For the deterministic user we propose a framework to minimize a bound on the
maximum deviation from the optimal solution, namely regret. We adapt the

pixels, with single photon counting sensitivity. The telescope also contains

degrees, a spatial resolution of about 6.3 km on the Earth surface and of about
4.7 km on the ionosphere. The telescope detects UV emissions of cosmic,
atmospheric and terrestrial origin on different time scales, from a few
micoseconds upwards. On the fastest timescale of 2.5 microseconds, Mini-EUSO is
able to observe atmospheric phenomena as Transient Luminous Events and in
particular the ELVES, which take place when an electromagnetic wave generated
by intra-cloud lightning interacts with the ionosphere, ionizing it and
producing apparently superluminal expanding rings of several 100 km and lasting

on foam stability, surface coverage, bubble size, gas flow rate, etc. In this
work, we performed flotation experiments using bovine serum albumin (BSA). In
addition, an unsteady state simulation of the protein flotation process was
carried out by numerically solving the liquid drainage equation in the foam.
Thereby, the extracted liquid volume and protein concentration at the outlet
were calculated with time. Required quantities such as foam stability,
interface coverage or bubble size distribution were measured in corresponding
experiments and were fed into the model. The experiments showed that the foam
coalescence accelerates the liquid drainage leading to dryer extract and higher

The modeling solely relies on experimental inputs and does not require any

degraded performance of face-related tasks. Although much effort has been
devoted to removing occlusions from face images, the varying shapes and
textures of occlusions still challenge the robustness of current methods. As a
result, current methods either rely on manual occlusion masks or only apply to
specific occlusions. This paper proposes a novel face de-occlusion model based
on face segmentation and 3D face reconstruction, which automatically removes
all kinds of face occlusions with even blurred boundaries,e.g., hairs. The
proposed model consists of a 3D face reconstruction module, a face segmentation
module, and an image generation module. With the face prior and the occlusion
mask predicted by the first two, respectively, the image generation module can
faithfully recover the missing facial textures. To supervise the training, we
further build a large occlusion dataset, with both manually labeled and
synthetic occlusions. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

population-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons. This debate is of central
importance for policy-makers and applied practitioners in health technology
assessment. Misunderstandings are based on properties inherent to estimators,
not estimands, and on generalizing conclusions based on linear regression to
non-linear models. Estimators of marginal estimands need not be unadjusted and
may be covariate-adjusted. The population-level interpretation of conditional
estimates follows from collapsibility and does not necessarily hold for the
underlying conditional estimands. For non-collapsible effect measures, neither
conditional estimates nor estimands have a population-level interpretation.
Estimators of marginal effects tend to be more precise and efficient than
estimators of conditional effects where the measure of effect is
non-collapsible. In any case, such comparisons are inconsequential for
estimators targeting distinct estimands. Statistical efficiency should not
drive the choice of the estimand. On the other hand, the estimand, selected on
the basis of relevance to decision-making, should drive the choice of the most
efficient estimator. Health technology assessment agencies make reimbursement
decisions at the population level. Therefore, marginal estimands are required.
Current pairwise population adjustment methods such as matching-adjusted
indirect comparison are restricted to target marginal estimands that are
specific to the comparator study sample. These may not be relevant for
decision-making. Multilevel network meta-regression (ML-NMR) can potentially
target marginal estimands in any population of interest. Such population could
be characterized by decision-makers using increasingly available ""real-world""
data sources. Therefore, ML-NMR presents new directions and abundant
opportunities for evidence synthesis.

nodes, connected by edges of specific relation types. However, information and
knowledge evolve continuously, and temporal dynamics emerge, which are expected
to influence future situations. In temporal knowledge graphs, time information
is integrated into the graph by equipping each edge with a timestamp or a time
range. Embedding-based methods have been introduced for link prediction on
temporal knowledge graphs, but they mostly lack explainability and
comprehensible reasoning chains. Particularly, they are usually not designed to
deal with link forecasting -- event prediction involving future timestamps. We
address the task of link forecasting on temporal knowledge graphs and introduce
TLogic, an explainable framework that is based on temporal logical rules
extracted via temporal random walks. We compare TLogic with state-of-the-art
baselines on three benchmark datasets and show better overall performance while
our method also provides explanations that preserve time consistency.
Furthermore, in contrast to most state-of-the-art embedding-based methods,
TLogic works well in the inductive setting where already learned rules are
transferred to related datasets with a common vocabulary.

and binary parameters (binary fraction and mass-ratio distribution), with high
precision and reliability. The model treats an OC in the CMD as a mixture of
single and binary member stars and field stars in the same region. The cluster
members are modeled using a theoretical stellar model, MF and binary
properties. The field component is modeled nonparametrically using a separate
field-star sample in the vicinity of the cluster. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on stringent member selection, ours allows us to use a sample of more
complete cluster members and attendant field stars. The larger star sample
reduces the statistical error and diminishes the potential bias by retaining
more stars that are crucial for age estimation and MF measurement. After
validating the method with 1000 mock clusters, we measured the parameters of 10
real OCs using Gaia EDR3 data. The best-fit isochrones are consistent with
previous measurements in general but with more precise age estimates for
several OCs. The inferred MF slope is -2.7 to -1.6 for clusters younger than 2

fundamental understanding of the magnetisation dynamics. Of particular interest
are magnetic nanodisks, in which the vortex state emerges as a stable spin
configuration. Here, we focus on how the vortex core polarisation can be
reversed periodically by an oscillating magnetic field, applied perpendicularly
to the disk's surface. By means of micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate
the presence of several subharmonic switching modes, i.e., the commensurate
ratio between the switching frequency of the core and the driving frequency.
The underlying mechanism of this periodic behaviour depends on the disk
thickness. For thin disks, the core switches periodically due to resonant
excitation of radial spin wave modes, while it is due to the breathing mode in
the case of thick disks. However, overlap of both modes impedes periodic vortex
core switching. For thin disks, the threshold field amplitude required for
periodic switching can be lowered to about 30~mT by increasing the disk
diameter. For thick disks, in contrast, the minimal field is largely unaffected
by the disk diameter, as only the energy density of a central region around the
vortex core is relevant to excite the breathing mode. Our results contribute to
the understanding of the switching mechanisms in magnetic nanodisks, which are
of technological interest due to their potential in non-volatile memory
devices.

modeling light transport in turbid media. Typical MCRT models use voxels or
meshes to approximate experimental geometry. A voxel based geometry does not
allow for the accurate modeling of smooth curved surfaces, such as may be found
in biological systems or food and drink packaging.
  Aim: We present our algorithm which we term signedMCRT (sMCRT), a new
geometry-based method which uses signed distance functions (SDF) to represent
the geometry of the model. SDFs are capable of modeling smooth curved surfaces
accurately whilst also modeling complex geometries.
  Approach: We show that using SDFs to represent the problem's geometry is more
accurate and can be faster than voxel based methods. sMCRT, can easily be
incorporated into existing voxel based models.
  Results: sMCRT is validated against theoretical expressions, and other voxel
based MCRT codes. We show that sMCRT can accurately model arbitrary complex
geometries such as microvascular vessel network using SDFs. In comparison to
the current state-of-the-art in MCRT methods specifically for curved surfaces,
sMCRT is up-to forty-five times more accurate.
  Conclusions: sMCRT is a highly accurate, fast MCRT method that outperforms
comparable voxel based models due to its ability to model smooth curved
surfaces. sMCRT is up-to three times faster than a voxel model for equivalent
scenarios. sMCRT is publicly available at

temperature is lowered towards the glass transition ($T_{g}$). A hallmark of
this dynamical heterogeneity is the spontaneous emergence of cooperative
rearranging regions (CRRs) composed of fast moving particles. While these CRRs
in passive glass formers have been explored in great detail, thus understanding
is severely limited in active glass formers. The existing consensus on the
morphology of CRRs in a passive glass former prioritizes its fast subsets,
composed of fast moving particles. In the present study, we focus on a
synthetic athermal active glass former and show an equal contribution for the
morphology of CRRs from slow subsets as well. Both these subsets exhibit an
exponential distribution in their structure which strongly correlates with the
existence of CRRs. Interestingly, we also observe that the fractal dimensions
($d_{\text{f}}$) of these subsets share both string and compact like morphology
that tends to vary in opposite fashion with the control parameters, namely the
persistent time ($\tau_{p}$) and the effective temperature ($T_{\text{eff}}$).
The fractal dimension $d_{\text{f}}$ measures the roughness or put simply the
compactness of fractal objects at their boundaries. More precisely, molecules
are loosely bound in a structure for which boundary is rough and thereby this
condition facilitates its structural change in terms of size and shape. It is

Bone Regeneration (GBR) therapy leading to compromised clinical results.
Photoactive atelocollagen (AC) systems functionalised with ethylenically
unsaturated monomers, such as 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (4VBC), have been shown to
generate mechanically competent materials for wound healing, inflammation
control and drug delivery, whereby control of the molecular architecture of the
AC network is key. Building on this platform, the sequential functionalisation
with 4VBC and methacrylic anhydride (MA) was hypothesised to generate UV-cured
AC hydrogels with reduced swelling ratio, increased proteolytic stability and
barrier functionality for GBR therapy. The sequentially functionalised
atelocollagen precursor (SAP) was characterised via TNBS and ninhydrin
colourimetric assays, circular dichroism and UV-curing rheometry, which
confirmed nearly complete consumption of collagen primary amino groups,
preserved triple helices and fast (within 180 s) gelation kinetics,
respectively. Hydrogel swelling ratio and compression modulus were adjusted
depending on the aqueous environment used for UV-curing, whilst the sequential
functionalisation of AC successfully generated hydrogels with superior
proteolytic stability in vitro compared to both 4VBC functionalised control and
the commercial dental membrane Bio-Gide. These in vitro results were confirmed
in vivo via both subcutaneous implantation and a proof-of-concept study in a
GBR calvarial model, indicating integrity of the hydrogel and barrier defect,
as well as tissue formation following 1-month implantation in rats.

rate of dark matter halos. We define a specific merger rate by normalizing the
average number of mergers per halo with the logarithmic mass growth change of
the hosts at the time of accretion. Based on the simulation results, we find
that this specific merger rate,
$\mathrm{d}N_{\mathrm{merge}}(\xi|M,z)/\mathrm{d}\xi/\mathrm{d}\log M(z)$, has
a universal form, which is only a function of the mass ratio of merging halo
pairs, $\xi$, and does not depend on the host halo mass, $M$, or redshift, $z$,
over a wide range of masses ($10^{12}\lesssim M \lesssim10^{14}\,M_\odot/h$)
and merger ratios ($\xi\ge 1e-2$). We further test with simulations of
different $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, and get the same specific merger rate. The
universality of the specific merger rate shows that halos in the universe are
built up self-similarly, with a universal composition in the mass contributions
and an absolute merger rate that grows in proportion to the halo mass growth.
As a result, the absolute merger rate relates with redshift and cosmology only
through the halo mass variable, whose evolution can be readily obtained from
the universal mass accretion history (MAH) model of \cite{2009ApJ...707..354Z}.
Lastly, we show that this universal specific merger rate immediately predicts
an universal un-evolved subhalo mass function that is independent on the
redshift, MAH or the final halo mass, and vice versa.

genetic elements in speciation and species maintenance. The theory explains how
speciation and species maintenance are caused by natural selection acting on
non-Mendelian and Mendelian variation, respectively. The emergence and
maintenance of species as groups of populations are balanced by evolutionary
forces including complementary mechanisms of gene flow within and between
populations at population-specific rates: sexual and asexual reproduction,
recombining and nonrecombining genome regions, vertical and horizontal DNA
transfer, and transposon proliferation and control. While recombining genome
regions carry conserved genes and are subjected to meiotic recombination,
nonrecombining genome regions carry accessory genes and are not subjected to
such structural restrain. Sexual reproduction, vertical DNA transfer,
recombining genome regions and transposon control keep species in existence by
maintaining recombining chromosome number and structure, while asexual
reproduction, horizontal DNA transfer, nonrecombining genome regions and
transposon proliferation help species emerge by promoting reproductive
isolation and changes in chromosome number and structure. The theory is based

evaluate multiple methods and choose one of these methods or an ensemble for
producing the best forecasts. However, choosing among different ensembles over
multiple methods remains a challenging task that undergoes a combinatorial
explosion as the number of methods increases. In the context of demand
forecasting or revenue forecasting, this challenge is further exacerbated by a
large number of time series as well as limited historical data points available
due to changing business context. Although deep learning forecasting methods
aim to simultaneously forecast large collections of time series, they become
challenging to apply in such scenarios due to the limited history available and
might not yield desirable results. We propose a framework for forecasting short
high-dimensional time series data by combining low-rank temporal matrix
factorization and optimal model selection on latent time series using
cross-validation. We demonstrate that forecasting the latent factors leads to
significant performance gains as compared to directly applying different
uni-variate models on time series. Performance has been validated on a
truncated version of the M4 monthly dataset which contains time series data
from multiple domains showing the general applicability of the method.
Moreover, it is amenable to incorporating the analyst view of the future owing
to the low number of latent factors which is usually impractical when applying
forecasting methods directly to high dimensional datasets.

3D assessment of the environment, such as robotics, augmented reality, and
autonomous driving to name a few. One prominent technique for depth estimation
is stereo matching which has several advantages: it is considered more
accessible than other depth-sensing technologies, can produce dense depth
estimates in real-time, and has benefited greatly from the advances of deep
learning in recent years. However, current techniques for depth estimation from
stereoscopic images still suffer from a built-in drawback. To reconstruct
depth, a stereo matching algorithm first estimates the disparity map between
the left and right images before applying a geometric triangulation. A simple
analysis reveals that the depth error is quadratically proportional to the
object's distance. Therefore, constant disparity errors are translated to large
depth errors for objects far from the camera. To mitigate this quadratic
relation, we propose a simple but effective method that uses a refinement
network for depth estimation. We show analytical and empirical results
suggesting that the proposed learning procedure reduces this quadratic
relation. We evaluate the proposed refinement procedure on well-known
benchmarks and datasets, like Sceneflow and KITTI datasets, and demonstrate
significant improvements in the depth accuracy metric.

for different transportation modes can be correlated with each other. Despite
some recent efforts, existing approaches to multimodal demand prediction are
generally not flexible enough to account for multiplex networks with diverse
spatial units and heterogeneous spatiotemporal correlations across different
modes. To tackle these issues, this study proposes a multi-relational
spatiotemporal graph neural network (ST-MRGNN) for multimodal demand
prediction. Specifically, the spatial dependencies across modes are encoded
with multiple intra- and inter-modal relation graphs. A multi-relational graph
neural network (MRGNN) is introduced to capture cross-mode heterogeneous
spatial dependencies, consisting of generalized graph convolution networks to
learn the message passing mechanisms within relation graphs and an
attention-based aggregation module to summarize different relations. We further
integrate MRGNNs with temporal gated convolution layers to jointly model
heterogeneous spatiotemporal correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted
using real-world subway and ride-hailing datasets from New York City, and the
results verify the improved performance of our proposed approach over existing
methods across modes. The improvement is particularly large for demand-sparse
locations. Further analysis of the attention mechanisms of ST-MRGNN also
demonstrates its good interpretability for understanding cross-mode

efficient way to achieve quantum degeneracy in Fermi systems. However, all
attempts to use this method for cooling ions until recently were ineffective
because of the unremovable ion `""micromotion"" in electromagnetic Paul traps,
which prevents the realization of a number of hot projects with cold atom-ion
systems. In this regard, we propose a new efficient method for sympathetic
cooling of ions: the use for this purpose of cold buffer atoms in the region of
atom-ion confinement-induced resonances (CIRs) [V.S. Melezhik, Phys. Rev. A103,
53109 (2021)]. We show that the destructive effect of ""micromotion"" on its
sympathetic cooling can, however, be suppressed in the vicinity of the atom-ion
CIR. Here, the resonant blocking of a close collision of an atom with an ion
also resists its heating due to ""micromotion"". We investigate the effect of
sympathetic cooling around CIRs in atom-ion, and atom-atom confined collisions
within the quantum-quasiclassical approach using the Li-Yb$^+$ and Li-Yb
confined systems as an example. In this approach, the Schr\""odinger equation
for a cold light atom is integrated simultaneously with the classical Hamilton
equations for a hotter heavy-ion or atom during a collision. We have found the
region near the atom-ion CIR where the sympathetic cooling of the ion by cold
atoms is possible in a hybrid atom-ion trap. We also show that it is possible
to improve the efficiency of sympathetic cooling in atomic traps by using
atomic CIRs.

address the electroweak naturalness problem and the axion high quality problem.
The framework is based on a doubly composite dynamics where the second
confinement takes place after the CFT encounters the first confinement and the
theory flows into another conformal fixed point. For a calculable example, we
present a holographic dual description of the 4D model via a warped extra
dimension model with three 3-branes. While the hierarchy problem is taken cared
of by the localization of the Higgs fields on the TeV brane just as in the
original Randall-Sundrum model, the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is realized as a
gauge symmetry in the bulk of the extra dimension to solve the axion quality
problem. We introduce a 5D scalar field whose potential at the intermediate
brane drives spontaneous breaking of the PQ symmetry. Then, the PQ breaking
scale is given by the scale of the intermediate brane and is naturally small
compared to the Planck scale. The axion bulk profile is significantly
suppressed around the UV brane, which protects the axion from gravitational
violations of the PQ symmetry on the UV brane. Our model genuinely predicts the

the neurmorphic photonics' context, VCSELs are of exceptional interest as they
are compatible with CMOS fabrication, readily achieve 30\% wall-plug efficiency

ultra-fast. Crucially, they react highly nonlinear to optical injection as well
as to electrical modulation, making them highly suitable as all-optical as well
as electro-optical photonic neurons. Their optical cavities are
wavelength-limited, and standard semiconductor growth and lithography enables
non-classical cavity configurations and geometries. This enables excitable
VCSELs (i.e. spiking VCSELs) to finely control their temporal and spatial
coherence, to unlock Terahertz bandwidths through spin-flip effects, and even
to leverage cavity quantum electrodynamics to further boost their efficiency.
Finally, as VCSEL arrays they are compatible with standard 2D photonic
integration, but their emission vertical to the substrate makes them ideally
suited for scalable integrated networks leveraging 3D photonic waveguides.

multiplexed VCSEL neural networks and reservoirs, computation on the basis of

$6.4 \times 10^{11}$ $n_{eq}/cm^2$. Based on such simulations, we irradiated
several SiPM technologies. We developed a custom experimental setup, which was
used to perform online reverse voltage-current, right after each irradiation
step, to minimize the effect of the annealing on the measurement.

key to make the most of available data. To this aim, several methods such as
evolutionary strategies, random search, Bayesian optimization and heuristic
rules of thumb have been proposed. In reinforcement learning (RL), the
information content of data gathered by the learning agent while interacting
with its environment is heavily dependent on the setting of many
hyper-parameters. Therefore, the user of an RL algorithm has to rely on
search-based optimization methods, such as grid search or the Nelder-Mead
simplex algorithm, that are very inefficient for most RL tasks, slows down
significantly the learning curve and leaves to the user the burden of
purposefully biasing data gathering. In this work, in order to make an RL
algorithm more user-independent, a novel approach for autonomous
hyper-parameter setting using Bayesian optimization is proposed. Data from past
episodes and different hyper-parameter values are used at a meta-learning level
by performing behavioral cloning which helps improving the effectiveness in
maximizing a reinforcement learning variant of an acquisition function. Also,
by tightly integrating Bayesian optimization in a reinforcement learning agent
design, the number of state transitions needed to converge to the optimal
policy for a given task is reduced. Computational experiments reveal promising
results compared to other manual tweaking and optimization-based approaches
which highlights the benefits of changing the algorithm hyper-parameters to
increase the information content of generated data.

fundamental band gap but almost vanishing oscillator strength for the
lowest-energy optical transitions. Perturbing the system by replacing a Ge atom
in the unit cell with a Si atom boosts of the oscillator strength at the
minimum direct gap by orders of magnitude, with a concurrent blue shift of the
interband distances. This effect is mainly due to the increased s character of
the lowest conduction band because of the perturbation-induced wave function
mixing. A purely structural modification of the lonsdaleite unit cell of
hexagonal Ge yields as well increased optical oscillator strengths, but their
magnitude significantly depends on the actual details of the atomic geometry.
In particular, moderate tensile uniaxial strain can induce an inversion of the

individual sequence) for the degraded wiretap channel by means of an encoder
and decoder that can both be implemented as finite--state machines. Our first
main result is a necessary condition for both reliable and secure transmission
in terms of the given source sequence, the bandwidth expansion factor, the
secrecy capacity, the number of states of the encoder and the number of states
of the decoder. Equivalently, this necessary condition can be presented as a
converse bound (i.e., a lower bound) on the smallest achievable bandwidth
expansion factor. The bound is asymptotically achievable by Lempel-Ziv
compression followed by good channel coding for the wiretap channel. Given that
the lower bound is saturated, we also derive a lower bound on the minimum
necessary rate of purely random bits needed for local randomness at the encoder
in order to meet the security constraint. This bound too is achieved by the
same achievability scheme. Finally, we extend the main results to the case
where the legitimate decoder has access to a side information sequence, which
is another individual sequence that may be related to the source sequence, and
a noisy version of the side information sequence leaks to the wiretapper.

generalized tensor weight distribution of a code and establish a bijection

the excitation of quasinormal modes (QNMs), i.e., the eigenmodes of the system.
This Review addresses three fundamental concepts in relation with the
representation of the scattered field as a superposition of the excited QNMs:
normalization, orthogonality, and completeness. Orthogonality and normalization
enable a straightforward assessment of the QNM excitation strength for any
incident wave. Completeness guaranties that the scattered field can be
faithfully expanded into the QNM basis. These concepts are non-trivial for
non-conservative (non-Hermitian) systems and have driven many theoretical
developments since initial studies in the 70's. Yet, owing to recent
achievements, they are not easily grasped from the extensive and scattered
literature, especially for newcomers in the field. After recalling fundamental
results obtained in early studies on the completeness of the QNM basis for
simple resonant systems, we review recent achievements and debates on the
normalization, clarify under which circumstances the QNM basis is complete, and
highlight the concept of QNM regularization with complex coordinate transform.

other quantum many-body techniques, we demonstrate a high quantitative accuracy
of our method. Particularly, for the unfrustrated simple cubic lattice
antiferromagnet ordering temperatures obtained from finite-size scaling of
one-loop data deviate from error controlled quantum Monte Carlo results by
$\sim5\%$ and we further confirm the established values for the critical
exponent $\nu$ and the anomalous dimension $\eta$. As the PMFRG yields results
in good agreement with QMC, but remains applicable when the system is
frustrated, we next treat the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a
paradigmatic magnetically disordered system and find nearly perfect agreement
of our two-loop static homogeneous susceptibility with other methods. We
further investigate the broadening of pinch points in the spin structure factor

the extrapolated limit $T\rightarrow0$. While extensions towards higher loop

information: a single-qubit is represented by the presence of a single quantum
walker in either of the two parallel paths. We develop a roundabout gate that
moves a walker from one path to the next, either clockwise or counterclockwise,

scattering on a directed weighted graph with the edge weights $1$ and $\pm i$.
The roundabout gate also allows the spatial information of the quantum walker

constructed by appropriately combining several roundabout gates, some unitary
gates that act on the internal states and two-particle scatterings on straight
paths. Any ancilla qubit is not required in our model. The computation is done
by just passing quantum walkers through properly designed paths. Namely, there
is no need for any time-dependent control. A physical implementation of quantum

depth and ego-motion from monocular videos, achieving remarkable performance in
autonomous driving scenarios. One widely adopted assumption of depth and
ego-motion self-supervised learning is that the image brightness remains
constant within nearby frames. Unfortunately, the endoscopic scene does not
meet this assumption because there are severe brightness fluctuations induced
by illumination variations, non-Lambertian reflections and interreflections
during data collection, and these brightness fluctuations inevitably
deteriorate the depth and ego-motion estimation accuracy. In this work, we
introduce a novel concept referred to as appearance flow to address the
brightness inconsistency problem. The appearance flow takes into consideration
any variations in the brightness pattern and enables us to develop a
generalized dynamic image constraint. Furthermore, we build a unified
self-supervised framework to estimate monocular depth and ego-motion

this inherent deficiency, we introduce a lightweight latent variable model

harmonic oscillators. The bosonic decay rate of the most superradiant state
increases linearly as a function of the filling factor and exceeds that of
two-level systems in magnitude. Furthermore, with bosonic systems, dark states
are formed at each filling factor. These are in strong contrast with two-level
systems, where the maximal superradiance is observed at half filling and with
larger filling factors superradiance diminishes and no dark states are formed.

user preferences from dialog history, providing accurate recommendations, and
generating appropriate responses. Previous CRSs use knowledge graph (KG) based
recommendation modules and integrate KG with language models for response
generation. Although KG-based approaches prove effective, two issues remain to
be solved. First, KG-based approaches ignore the information in the
conversational context but only rely on entity relations and bag of words to
recommend items. Second, it requires substantial engineering efforts to
maintain KGs that model domain-specific relations, thus leading to less
flexibility. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective architecture
comprising a pre-trained language model (PLM) and an item metadata encoder. The
encoder learns to map item metadata to embeddings that can reflect the semantic
information in the dialog context. The PLM then consumes the semantic-aligned
item embeddings together with dialog context to generate high-quality
recommendations and responses. Instead of modeling entity relations with KGs,
our model reduces engineering complexity by directly converting each item to an
embedding. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset ReDial show that our
model obtains state-of-the-art results on both recommendation and response
generation tasks.

evidence for a systematically varying stellar initial mass function (IMF). Then
we focus on the impact of this paradigm change, that is, from the universal
invariant IMF to a variable IMF, on galaxy chemical evolution (GCE) studies.
For this aim, we developed the first GCE code, GalIMF, that is able to
incorporate the empirically calibrated environment-dependent IMF variation
theory, the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) theory. In this
theory, the galaxy-wide IMF is calculated by summing all the IMFs in all
embedded star clusters which formed throughout the galaxy in 10 Myr time
epochs. The GalIMF code recalculates the galaxy-wide IMF at each time step
because the integrated galaxy-wide IMF depends on the galactic star formation
rate and metallicity. The resulting galaxy-wide IMF and metal abundance evolve
with time. Using this code, we examine the chemical evolution of early-type
galaxies (ETGs) from dwarf to the most massive. We find that the introduction
of the non-canonical IMF affects the best estimation of the galaxy properties
such as their mass, star formation history, and star formation efficiency.
Moreover, we are able to provide an independent estimation on the stellar
formation timescale of galaxies, the type Ia supernova production efficiency,
and constrain the IMF variation law of the low-mass stars. This work provides
to the community the publicly available GalIMF code with improved constraints
on the IMF variation and has, for the first time, resolved the discrepancy
between the galaxy formation timescales obtained from stellar population
synthesis and chemical enrichment studies.

derive the analytical form of the equatorial gravitational deflection angle of

bending angle, which is found to be consistent with the result in the previous
work, is adopted to solve the popular Virbhadra-Ellis lens equation. The
analytical expressions for the main observable properties of the primary and
secondary images of the particle source are thus obtained beyond the
weak-deflection limit, within the framework of standard perturbation theory.
The observables include the positions, magnifications, and gravitational time
delays of the individual images, the differential time delay, and the total
magnification and centroid position. The explicit forms of the correctional
effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the massive
particle from the speed of light on the observables of the lensed images are

however, fall short for its low imaging throughput and limited resolution.
Here, we report a resolution-enhanced parallel coded ptychography technique
achieving the highest numerical aperture and an imaging throughput orders of
magnitude greater than previous demonstrations. In this platform, we translate
the samples across the disorder-engineered surfaces for lensless diffraction
data acquisition. The engineered surface consists of chemically etched
micron-level phase scatters and printed sub-wavelength intensity absorbers. It
is designed to unlock an optical space with spatial extent (x, y) and frequency
content (kx, ky) that is inaccessible using conventional lens-based optics. To
achieve the best resolution performance, we also report a new coherent
diffraction imaging model by considering both the spatial and angular responses
of the pixel readouts. Our low-cost prototype can directly resolve 308-nm
linewidth on the resolution target without aperture synthesizing. Gigapixel
high-resolution microscopic images with a 240-mm^2 effective field of view can
be acquired in 15 seconds. For demonstrations, we recover slow-varying 3D phase
objects with many 2{\pi} wraps, including optical prism and convex lens. The
low-frequency phase contents of these objects are challenging to obtain using
other existing lensless techniques. For digital pathology applications, we
perform accurate virtual staining by using the recovered phase as attention
guidance in a deep neural network. Parallel optical processing using the
reported technique enables novel optical instruments with inherent quantitative
nature and metrological versatility.

  partitioning for large studies",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) is a useful approach to causal
inference from observational studies when randomised controlled trials are not
feasible. However, study heterogeneity of two association studies required in
MR is often overlooked. When dealing with large studies, recently developed
Bayesian MR is limited by its computational expensiveness. Methods: We
addressed study heterogeneity by proposing a random effect Bayesian MR model
with multiple exposures and outcomes. For large studies, we adopted a subset
posterior aggregation method to tackle the problem of computation. In
particular, we divided data into subsets and combine estimated subset causal
effects obtained from the subsets"". The performance of our method was evaluated
by a number of simulations, in which part of exposure data was missing.
Results: Random effect Bayesian MR outperformed conventional inverse-variance
weighted estimation, whether the true causal effects are zero or non-zero. Data
partitioning of large studies had little impact on variations of the estimated
causal effects, whereas it notably affected unbiasedness of the estimates with
weak instruments and high missing rate of data. Our simulation results indicate
that data partitioning is a good way of improving computational efficiency, for
little cost of decrease in unbiasedness of the estimates, as long as the sample
size of subsets is reasonably large. Conclusions: We have further advanced
Bayesian MR by including random effects to explicitly account for study
heterogeneity. We also adopted a subset posterior aggregation method to address
the issue of computational expensiveness of MCMC, which is important especially
when dealing with large studies. Our proposed work is likely to pave the way
for more general model settings, as Bayesian approach itself renders great
flexibility in model constructions.

in an applied magnetic field. We show that when the coupling is strong, the
topological phase transition point is very sensitive to the size of the
superconductor and in order to reach the topological phase a strong magnetic
field is required, which can easily be detrimental for superconductivity.
Moreover, the induced energy gap separating the Majorana bound states and other
quasi-particles in the topological phase is substantially suppressed compared
to the gap at zero field. In contrast, in the weak coupling regime, we find
that the situation is essentially the opposite, with the topological phase
emerging at much lower magnetic fields and a sizable induced energy gap in the
topological phase, that can also be controlled by the chemical potential of the
superconductor. Furthermore, we show that the weak coupling regime does not
generally allow for the formation of topologically trivial zero-energy states
at the wire end points, in stark contrast to the strong coupling regime where
such states are found for a wide range of parameters. Our results thus put

zero at the critical temperature where the magnetization is approximately zero.
This study estimates the temperature dependence of the magnetocrystalline

($M$--$H$) curves, and found that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is still
finite even above the Curie temperature in the uniaxial anisotropy, whereas
this does not appear in the cubic anisotropy case. The origin is the fast
reduction of the anisotropy field, which is the magnetic field required to
saturate the magnetization along the hard axis, in the case of cubic
anisotropy. Therefore, the magnetization anisotropy and anisotropic magnetic
susceptibility, those are the key factors of magnetic anisotropy, could not be
established in the case of cubic anisotropy. In addition, the effect of
magnetocrystalline anisotropy on magnetocaloric properties, as the difference
between the entropy change curves of AlFe$_{2}$B$_{2}$ appears above the Curie

Leibniz as contradicting the part-whole principle. Far from supporting this
reading, the letter is arguably consistent with the view that infinitesimals,
as inassignable quantities, are mentis fictiones, i.e., (well-founded) fictions
usable in mathematics, but possibly contrary to the Leibnizian principle of the
harmony of things and not necessarily idealizing anything in rerum natura.
Unlike infinite wholes, infinitesimals - as well as imaginary roots and other
well-founded fictions - may involve accidental (as opposed to absolute)
impossibilities, in accordance with the Leibnizian theories of knowledge and

effective model analogous to a magnetic wiggler are introduced; relation of
plasma wiggler characteristics with damping properties are demonstrated;
underpinning particle-in-cell simulations for laser propagation optimisation

with extracting meaningful features from small data sets. Advances in machine
learning have highlighted an alternative to traditional acoustic features,

image. Thereby, the primary goal is not to keep visual quality but maintain the
task accuracy of the machine for a given bitrate. Due to the tremendous
progress of deep neural networks setting benchmarking results, mostly neural
networks are employed to solve the analysis tasks at the decoder side.
Moreover, neural networks have also found their way into the field of image
compression recently. These two developments allow for an end-to-end training
of the neural compression network for an analysis network as information sink.
Therefore, we first roll out such a training with a task-specific loss to
enhance the coding performance of neural compression networks. Compared to the
standard VVC, 41.4% of bitrate are saved by this method for Mask R-CNN as
analysis network on the uncompressed Cityscapes dataset. As a main
contribution, we propose LSMnet, a network that runs in parallel to the encoder
network and masks out elements of the latent space that are presumably not
required for the analysis network. By this approach, additional 27.3% of
bitrate are saved compared to the basic neural compression network optimized
with the task loss. In addition, we are the first to utilize a feature-based
distortion in the training loss within the context of machine-to-machine
communication, which allows for a training without annotated data. We provide
extensive analyses on the Cityscapes dataset including cross-evaluation with
different analysis networks and present exemplary visual results. Inference

in turbulent wall-bounded flows. Its conventional setup consists of measuring
wall-normal velocity in the buffer layer and opposing it at the wall. This work
explores the possibility of implementing this strategy with a detection plane
in the logarithmic layer, where control could be feasible experimentally. We
apply control on a channel flow at $Re_\tau = 932$, only on the eddies with
relatively large wavelengths ($\lambda / h > 0.1$). Similarly to the buffer
layer opposition control, our control strategy results in a virtual-wall effect
for the wall-normal velocity, creating a minimum in its intensity. However, it
also induces a large response in the streamwise velocity and Reynolds stresses
near the wall, with a substantial drag increase. When the phase of the control
lags with respect to the detection plane, spanwise-homogeneous rollers are
observed near the channel wall. We show that they are a result of a linear
instability. In contrast, when the control leads with respect to the detection
plane, this instability is inactive and oblique waves are observed. Their
wall-normal profiles can be predicted linearly as a response of the turbulent
channel flow to a forcing with the advection velocity of the detection plane.
The linearity, governing the flow, opens a possibility to affect large scales
of the flow in a controlled manner, when enhanced turbulence intensity or
mixing is desired.

inference. Furthermore, multi-view matching can fail for texture-less surfaces,
reflective surfaces and moving objects. For such failure modes, single-view
depth estimation methods are often more reliable. To this end, we propose
MaGNet, a novel framework for fusing single-view depth probability with
multi-view geometry, to improve the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of
multi-view depth estimation. For each frame, MaGNet estimates a single-view
depth probability distribution, parameterized as a pixel-wise Gaussian. The
distribution estimated for the reference frame is then used to sample per-pixel
depth candidates. Such probabilistic sampling enables the network to achieve
higher accuracy while evaluating fewer depth candidates. We also propose depth
consistency weighting for the multi-view matching score, to ensure that the
multi-view depth is consistent with the single-view predictions. The proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, 7-Scenes and KITTI.
Qualitative evaluation demonstrates that our method is more robust against

been impacted by HII regions. The ALMA-IMF catalog contains 700 cores that span
a mass range of 0.15-250Msun at a typical size of 2100au. We show that this

used to look for inflowing gas streamers and to quantify the impact of the
possible associated core mass growth on the shape of the CMF with time. Our
first analysis does not reveal any significant evolution of the matter
concentration from clouds to cores or from the youngest to more evolved

input is a sequence of symbols encoding an initial set of block stacks as well
as a target set, and the output is a sequence of motion commands such as ""put
the top block in stack 1 on the table"". The program is written in the Assembly
Calculus, a recently proposed computational framework meant to model
computation in the brain by bridging the gap between neural activity and
cognitive function. Its elementary objects are assemblies of neurons (stable
sets of neurons whose simultaneous firing signifies that the subject is
thinking of an object, concept, word, etc.), its commands include project and
merge, and its execution model is based on widely accepted tenets of
neuroscience. A program in this framework essentially sets up a dynamical
system of neurons and synapses that eventually, with high probability,
accomplishes the task. The purpose of this work is to establish empirically
that reasonably large programs in the Assembly Calculus can execute correctly
and reliably; and that rather realistic -- if idealized -- higher cognitive
functions, such as planning in the blocks world, can be implemented
successfully by such programs.

  Question","19 pages. Revision after referee report",,,,"math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Gruenberg-Kegel graph of a group is the undirected graph whose vertices
are those primes which occur as the order of an element of the group, and
distinct vertices $p$, $q$ are joined by an edge whenever the group has an
element of order $pq$. It reflects interesting properties of the group. A group
is said to be cut if the central units of its integral group ring are trivial.
This is a rich family of groups, which contains the well studied class of
rational groups, and has received attention recently. In the first part of this
paper we give a complete classification of the Gruenberg-Kegel graphs of finite
solvable cut groups which have at most three elements in their prime spectrum.
For the remaining cases of finite solvable cut groups, we strongly restrict the
list of the possible Gruenberg-Kegel graphs and realize most of them by finite
solvable cut groups. Likewise, we give a list of the possible Gruenberg-Kegel
graphs of finite solvable rational groups and realize as such all but one of
them. As an application, we completely classify the Gruenberg-Kegel graphs of
metacyclic, metabelian, supersolvable, metanilpotent and $2$-Frobenius groups
for the classes of cut groups and rational groups, respectively. The Prime
Graph Question asks whether the Gruenberg-Kegel graph of a group coincides with
that of the group of normalized units of its integral group ring. The recent
appearance of a counter-example for the First Zassenhaus Conjecture on the
torsion units of integral group rings has highlighted the relevance of this
question. We answer the Prime Graph Question for integral group rings for
finite rational groups and most finite cut groups.

vortex-antivortex pairs, instead of the usual Josephson vortex lattice.
Enclosing a unit cell of the array, the London's fluxoid is quantized as
$\Phi^{\prime}=\Phi_0=hc/2e$, while the net orbital magnetization caused by the
staggered supercurrent is zero. Meanwhile, a small parallel magnetic field
gives rise to an Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state that has uniform superfluid density.

universality class of two-dimensional commensurate-incommensurate transitions.
An analytical solution in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions is found to be
an excellent approximation to the Bloch SC order parameter.

of dispersion off of other photon fields within the blazar (produced by the

quasar 3C454.3 and propagating ALPs through the model both with and without the

strongly affect the mixing, particularly at energies above 100 GeV -- often
reducing the ALP-photon conversion probability. This could have implications

low-entropy prediction by either accepting the determining class (with the
largest probability) as the true label or suppressing subtle predictions (with
the smaller probabilities). Unarguably, these distillation strategies are
usually heuristic and less informative for model training. From this
discernment, this paper proposes a dual mechanism, named ADaptive Sharpening

predictions, distilling certain predictions with the informed ones only. More
importantly, we theoretically analyze the traits of \ADS by comparing with

introduction to the fundamentals, describing the state of the art of the topics
considered. The basics of the $\Lambda$CDM are presented in Chapter 1. Chapter
2 overviews the historical progress of evidences of Dark Matter, followed by a
discussion of the status and small-scale issues of the Cold Dark Matter
paradigm, examining two alternative non-standard scenarios: Warm Dark Matter
and Interacting Dark Matter. Chapter 3 considers Primordial Black Holes as
another Dark Matter candidate, discussing the effects of accretion of
surrounding matter and the enhancement of small-scale fluctuations due to the
Poisson shot noise, both of which could leave an observational impact in the
Intergalactic Medium. The fundamentals of the 21 cm cosmological signal are

brightness temperature, and discussing its spatial fluctuations via the power
spectrum. Finally, Chapter 5 is dedicated to the ionization and thermal

beam-splitters, realizing arbitrary Gaussian operations between bosonic modes
can become highly non-trivial or even infeasible. In this work, we develop
novel interference-based protocols for engineering Gaussian operations in

Specifically, for a given generic multi-mode Gaussian unitary coupler, we
demonstrate a universal scheme for constructing Gaussian operations on a
desired subset of bosonic modes, requiring only multiple uses of the given
coupler interleaved with single-mode Gaussian unitaries. Our results provide
efficient construction of operations crucial to quantum information science and
are derived from fundamental physical properties of bosonic systems. The

data set compiled from the CT.gov, AACT and TrialTrove databases (n=1191
trials; representing one million patients) and describe the conversion of this
data to graph-structured formats. We then detail the mathematical basis and
implementation of a selection of graph machine learning algorithms, which
typically use standard machine classifiers on graph data embedded in a
low-dimensional feature space. We trained these models to predict side effect
information for a clinical trial given information on the disease, existing
medical conditions, and treatment. The MetaPath2Vec algorithm performed
exceptionally well, with standard Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random
Forest, Support Vector, and Neural Network classifiers exhibiting typical
ROC-AUC scores of 0.85, 0.68, 0.86, 0.80, and 0.77, respectively. Remarkably,
the best performing classifiers could only produce typical ROC-AUC scores of
0.70 when trained on equivalent array-structured data. Our work demonstrates
that graph modelling can significantly improve prediction accuracy on
appropriate datasets. Successive versions of the project that refine modelling
assumptions and incorporate more data types can produce excellent predictors

  Design/methodology/approach Human and environmental factors play an important
role in operations management activities since they significantly influence

  Practical implications The authors' research opens up new avenues for
profiling employees and adopting an individualized human resource management,

exists in markets with indivisible items. We introduce a new market equilibrium
notion, called two-price equilibrium (2PE). A 2PE is a relaxation of Walrasian
equilibrium, where instead of a single price per item, every item has two
prices: one for the item's owner and a (possibly) higher one for all other
buyers. Thus, a 2PE is given by a tuple
$(\textbf{S},\mathbf{\hat{p}},\mathbf{\check{p}})$ of an allocation
$\textbf{S}$ and two price vectors $\mathbf{\hat{p}},\mathbf{\check{p}}$, where
every buyer $i$ is maximally happy with her bundle $S_i$, given prices
$\mathbf{\check{p}}$ for items in $S_i$ and prices $\mathbf{\hat{p}}$ for all
other items. 2PE generalizes previous market equilibrium notions, such as
conditional equilibrium, and is related to relaxed equilibrium notions like
endowment equilibrium. We define the {\em discrepancy} of a 2PE -- a measure of
distance from Walrasian equilibrium -- as the sum of differences
$\hat{p}_j-\check{p}_j$ over all items (normalized by social welfare). We show
that the social welfare degrades gracefully with the discrepancy; namely, the
social welfare of a 2PE with discrepancy $d$ is at least a fraction
$\frac{1}{d+1}$ of the optimal welfare. We use this to establish welfare
guarantees for markets with subadditive valuations over identical items. In
particular, we show that every such market admits a 2PE with at least $1/7$ of
the optimal welfare. This is in contrast to Walrasian equilibrium or
conditional equilibrium which may not even exist. Our techniques provide new
insights regarding valuation functions over identical items, which we also use

this phase is marked by a local minimum in the inner disc age distribution 10
Gyr ago. At this time, we find the stellar populations to transition from high
to low alpha-element abundances and from high to low vertical velocity
dispersion. In the second phase, stars form across the disc with outwardly
decreasing metallicity. In this phase, inner disc stars form at super-solar
metallicites in a continuation of the early age-metallicity relation while
outer disc stars begin forming at metallicities at least 0.5 dex lower.
Finally, the third phase is associated with a recent burst of star formation

help constrain the processes driving each of the star formation phases.

identified by six available sepsis criteria were revealed by forest plots.
Sixteen machine learning classifiers were trained to predict in-hospital
mortality for sepsis patients. The performance of the trained model was tested
on the entire randomly conducted test set and each sub-population built based
on each of the following social determinants: race, gender, marital status,
insurance type, and language. Results We analyzed a total of 11,791 critical

each sepsis identification method, significant differences were observed among
sub-populations regarding race, marital status, insurance type, and language.
On the 5,783 sepsis patients identified by the Sepsis-3 criteria statistically
significant performance decreases for mortality prediction were observed when

cross-party data collaboration for real-world AI applications in a
privacy-preserving and law-regulated way. How to valuate parties' data is a
critical but challenging FL issue. In the literature, data valuation either
relies on running specific models for a given task or is just task irrelevant;
however, it is often requisite for party selection given a specific task when
FL models have not been determined yet. This work thus fills the gap and
proposes \emph{FedValue}, to our best knowledge, the first privacy-preserving,
task-specific but model-free data valuation method for vertical FL tasks.
Specifically, FedValue incorporates a novel information-theoretic metric termed
Shapley-CMI to assess data values of multiple parties from a game-theoretic
perspective. Moreover, a novel server-aided federated computation mechanism is
designed to compute Shapley-CMI and meanwhile protects each party from data
leakage. We also propose several techniques to accelerate Shapley-CMI
computation in practice. Extensive experiments on six open datasets validate
the effectiveness and efficiency of FedValue for data valuation of vertical FL

FARM learns a state representation that is distributed across multiple modules

of spike-based communication and spatiotemporal dynamics. In this paper, we
first identify that this negligence leads to impeded information flow and the
accompanying degradation problem in previous residual SNNs. To address this
issue, we propose a novel SNN-oriented residual architecture termed MS-ResNet,
which establishes membrane-based shortcut pathways, and further prove that the
gradient norm equality can be achieved in MS-ResNet by introducing block
dynamical isometry theory, which ensures the network can be well-behaved in a
depth-insensitive way. Thus we are able to significantly extend the depth of
directly trained SNNs, e.g., up to 482 layers on CIFAR-10 and 104 layers on
ImageNet, without observing any slight degradation problem. To validate the
effectiveness of MS-ResNet, experiments on both frame-based and neuromorphic
datasets are conducted. MS-ResNet104 achieves a superior result of 76.02%
accuracy on ImageNet, which is the highest to our best knowledge in the domain
of directly trained SNNs. Great energy efficiency is also observed, with an
average of only one spike per neuron needed to classify an input sample. We
believe our powerful and scalable models will provide a strong support for
further exploration of SNNs.

driver braking behavior, in the presence of a jaywalking pedestrian. A total of
93 participants from diverse socio-economic backgrounds were recruited for this
study, for which a virtual network of downtown Baltimore was created. An eye
tracking device was also used to observe distractions and head movements. A Log
logistic accelerated failure time (AFT) distribution model was used for this
analysis, to calculate speed reduction times; time from the moment the
pedestrian becomes visible, to the point where a minimum speed was reached, to
allow the pedestrian to pass. The presence of the PCW system significantly
impacted the speed reduction time and deceleration rate, as it increased the
former and reduced the latter, which proves the effectiveness of this system in
providing an effective driving maneuver, by drastically reducing speed. A jerk
analysis is conducted to analyze the suddenness of braking and acceleration.
Gaze analysis showed that the system was able to attract the attention of the
drivers, as the majority of the drivers noticed the displayed warning. The
familiarity of the driver with the route and connected vehicles reduces the
speed reduction time; gender also can have a significant impact as males tend
to have longer speed reduction time, i.e. more time to comfortably brake and
allow the pedestrian to pass.

simulation inspired by our recent study of insects traversing grass-like beams.
The 2-D model system consists of a forward self-propelled circular locomotor
translating on a frictionless level plane with a lateral random force and
interacting with two adjacent horizontal beams that form a gate. We found that
traversal probability increases monotonically with propulsive force, but first
increases then decreases with random force magnitude. For asymmetric beams with
different stiffness, traversal is more likely towards the side of the less
stiff beam. These observations are in accord with those expected from a
potential energy landscape approach. Furthermore, we extended the single gate
in a lattice configuration to form a large cluttered obstacle field. A Markov
chain Monte Carlo method was applied to predict traversal in the large field,
using the input-output probability map obtained from single gate simulations.
This method achieved high accuracy in predicting the statistical distribution
of the final location of the body within the obstacle field, while saving
computation time by a factor of 10^5 over our dynamic simulation.

is considered as an example, in which one can probe charge migration by
accessing both the iodine and bromine ends of the molecule with different
spectral windows of an extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pulse. The analytical
expression for transient absorption shows that the site-specific information of
charge migration is encoded in the complex phase of cross dipole products for
XUV transitions between the I-$4d$ and Br-$3d$ spectral windows. Ab-initio
quantum chemistry calculations on ICCBr$^+$ reveal that there is a constant
$\pi$ phase difference between the I-$4d$ and Br-$3d$ transient-absorption
spectral windows, irrespective of the fine-structure energy splittings.
Transient absorption spectra are simulated with a multistate model including
the complex dipole phase, and the results correctly reconstruct the

information technology. By misleading interpretations of Bohr's definition of
complementarity, the foundation of nonlocal correlations of entanglement is
concealed and therefore, such nonlocal effects can apparently not be utilized
directly in information technology. As the first step to identify the
utilizable nonlocal property of entanglement, this paper adjusts the notion of
complementarity of first-order and second-order interference. Especially, the
nonlocal consequence of the ""principle of least action"" for entangled systems
is shown by the foundation of second-order interference, the shared phase
solutions space. Based on the concept of Feynman's path integral, the validity
of the theory is demonstrated by applying the theory to well-known experiments,
revealing this underlying nonlocal principle. In the next steps of publication,
to highlight the relevance of this nonlocal principle for quantum computing and
quantum information technology, the ""self-consistency principle"" of such
nonlocal quantum causal correlations will be shown and verified by an
experiment.

existence and propagation of a simple mixed-mode oscillation that features
depolarization and refraction in alternating fashion. Detailed numerical
investigation reveals a mechanism for the emergence of complex mixed-mode

locomotor modes. It is well known that locomotor transitions can be induced by
switching in neural control circuits or be driven by a need to minimize
metabolic energetic cost. Recent work discovered that locomotor transitions in
complex 3-D terrain cluttered with large obstacles can also emerge from
physical interaction with the environment controlled by the nervous system. To
traverse cluttered, stiff grass-like beams, the discoid cockroach often
transitions from using a strenuous pitch mode to push across to using a less
strenuous roll mode to maneuver through the gaps, during which a potential
energy barrier must be overcome. Although previous robotic physical modeling
demonstrated that kinetic energy fluctuation from body oscillation generated by
leg propulsion can help overcome the barrier and facilitate this transition,
the animal was observed to transition even when the barrier still exceeds
kinetic energy fluctuation. Here, we further studied whether and how the
cockroach makes active adjustments to facilitate this locomotor transition to
traverse cluttered beams. We observed that the animal flexed its head and
abdomen, reduced hind leg sprawl, and used both hind legs differentially during
the pitch-to-roll transition, which were absent when running on a flat ground.
Using a refined potential energy landscape with additional degrees of freedom
modeling these adjustments, we found that head flexion did not substantially
reduce the transition barrier, whereas the leg sprawl reduction did so
dramatically. We discussed likely functions of the observed adjustments and
suggested future directions.

climate mitigation plans warrants closer examination to understand how these
actors intend to meet these goals. The scattered, incomplete and heterogeneous
nature of city climate policy documents, however, has made their systemic
analysis challenging. We analyze 318 climate action documents from cities that
have pledged net-zero targets or joined a transnational climate initiative with
this goal using machine learning-based natural language processing (NLP)
techniques. We use these approaches to accomplish two primary goals: 1)
determine text patterns that predict ""ambitious"" net-zero targets, where we
define an ambitious target as one that encompasses a subnational government's
economy-wide emissions; and 2) perform a sectoral analysis to identify patterns
and trade-offs in climate action themes (i.e., land-use, industry, buildings,
etc.). We find that cities that have defined ambitious climate actions tend to
emphasize quantitative metrics and specific high-emitting sectors in their
plans, supported by mentions of governance and citizen participation. Cities
predominantly emphasize energy-related actions in their plans, particularly in
the buildings, transport and heating sectors, but often at the expense of other
sectors, including land-use and climate impacts. The method presented in this
paper provides a replicable, scalable approach to analyzing climate action
plans and a first step towards facilitating cross-city learning.

unified national standard to measure bus on-time performance in the United
States. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the on-time performance
(OTP) of buses at transit agencies throughout the country, based on factors
unique to each agency. In this study, information on 18 public transit agencies
data were obtained from the National Transit Database and were verified by the
authors after contacting the respective agencies. A correlation analysis was
conducted to evaluate the influence of different factors on bus OTP. The
results show that a higher congestion ranking of the cities i.e. lesser traffic
has a positive correlation with OTP while a lower number of passengers per hour
has a negative correlation with OTP, both at a 95% confidence interval. Total
miles per active vehicle and average speed of the bus were found to have a
positive correlation with OTP at a 90% confidence interval. This potentially
suggests that, if the average speed of the bus is higher i.e. if the bus
operates at its scheduled speed, total miles per active vehicle will increase,
which will in turn lead to a better on-time performance. A flow diagram
interpreting the results of the correlation analysis was shown, where the main
bus service process was considered and the predecessors and successors which
could potentially affect the final OTP, were determined.

nonlinear responses that can dynamically change material properties. Prominent
examples are saturable absorption (SA) and two-photon absorption (TPA), which
dynamically increase and decrease the transmission of a sample depending on
pulse intensity, respectively. The availability of intense soft X-ray pulses
from free-electron lasers (FEL) has led to observations of SA and TPA in
separate experiments, leaving open questions about the possible interplay
between and relative strength of the two phenomena. Here, we systematically
study both phenomena in one experiment by exposing graphite films to soft X-ray
FEL pulses of varying intensity, with the FEL energy tuned to match carbon 1s
to $\pi^*$ or 1s to $\sigma^*$ transitions. It is observed for lower
intensities that the nonlinear contribution to the absorption is dominated by
SA attributed to ground-state depletion; for larger intensities ($>10^{14}$
W/cm$^2$), TPA becomes more dominant. The relative strengths of the two
phenomena depend in turn on the specific transition driven by the X-ray pulse.
Both observations are consistent with our real-time electronic structure
calculations. Our results reveal the competing contributions of distinct
nonlinear material responses to spectroscopic signals measured in the X-ray
regime, demonstrating an approach of general utility for interpreting FEL

interest in the use of neural signals -- either alone or in combination with
other data sources -- in the context of predicting video memorability by
highlighting the utility of EEG data. The dataset created consists of
pre-extracted features from EEG recordings of subjects while watching a subset
of videos from Predicting Media Memorability subtask 1. This demonstration
pilot gives interested researchers a sense of how neural signals can be used
without any prior domain knowledge, and enables them to do so in a future
memorability task. The dataset can be used to support the exploration of novel
machine learning and processing strategies for predicting video memorability,
while potentially increasing interdisciplinary interest in the subject of
memorability, and opening the door to new combined EEG-computer vision
approaches.

that $\forall x, x \cdot 0 = 0$, i.e., the equation is satisfied no matter what
$x$ is. We'll use zero to attack zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). In particular,
we'll discuss a critical issue in a cutting-edge ZKP PLONK [2] C++
implementation which allows an attacker to create a forged proof that all
verifiers will accept. We'll show how theory guides the attack's direction. In
practice, the attack works like a charm and we'll show how the attack falls
through a chain of perfectly aligned software cracks. In the same codebase,
there is an independent critical ECDSA bug where (r, s) = (0, 0) is a valid
signature for arbitrary keys and messages, but we won't discuss it further
because it's a known ECDSA attack vector in the Google Wycheproof cryptanalysis
project [3] that I worked on a few years ago.

  Gravitational Wave Analysis",,,,,"astro-ph.HE cs.LG gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Theory and Topological Data Analytics, while powerful, have many
drawbacks related to their sensitivity and consistency with TDA & Graph Network
Analytics. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel approach for encoding
vectorized associations between data points for the purpose of enabling smooth
transitions between Graph and Topological Data Analytics. We conclusively
reveal effective ways of converting such vectorized associations to simplicial
complexes representing micro-states in a Phase-Space, resulting in filter
specific, homotopic self-expressive, event-driven unique topological signatures
which we have referred as Roy-Kesselman Diagrams or R-K Diagrams with
persistent homology, which emerge from filter-based encodings of R-K Models.
The validity and impact of this approach were tested specifically on
high-dimensional raw and derived measures of Gravitational Wave Data from the
latest LIGO datasets published by the LIGO Open Science Centre along with
testing a generalized approach for a non-scientific use-case, which has been
demonstrated using the Tableau Superstore Sales dataset. We believe the
findings of our work will lay the foundation for many future scientific and
engineering applications of stable, high-dimensional data analysis with the
combined effectiveness of Topological Graph Theory transformations.

with the Federal Reserve estimating over \$650B in unmet annual financing
needs. Assessing the credit risk of a small business is key to making good
decisions whether to lend and at what terms. Large corporations have a
well-established credit assessment ecosystem, but small businesses suffer from
limited publicly available data and few (if any) credit analysts who cover them
closely. We explore the applicability of (DL-based) large corporate credit risk
models to small business credit rating.

  Fleeting Intraday Trading Opportunities",,,,,"q-fin.TR cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have shown great success in many
challenging quantitative trading tasks, such as portfolio management and
algorithmic trading. Especially, intraday trading is one of the most profitable
and risky tasks because of the intraday behaviors of the financial market that
reflect billions of rapidly fluctuating capitals. However, a vast majority of
existing RL methods focus on the relatively low frequency trading scenarios
(e.g., day-level) and fail to capture the fleeting intraday investment
opportunities due to two major challenges: 1) how to effectively train
profitable RL agents for intraday investment decision-making, which involves
high-dimensional fine-grained action space; 2) how to learn meaningful
multi-modality market representation to understand the intraday behaviors of
the financial market at tick-level. Motivated by the efficient workflow of
professional human intraday traders, we propose DeepScalper, a deep
reinforcement learning framework for intraday trading to tackle the above
challenges. Specifically, DeepScalper includes four components: 1) a dueling
Q-network with action branching to deal with the large action space of intraday
trading for efficient RL optimization; 2) a novel reward function with a
hindsight bonus to encourage RL agents making trading decisions with a
long-term horizon of the entire trading day; 3) an encoder-decoder architecture
to learn multi-modality temporal market embedding, which incorporates both
macro-level and micro-level market information; 4) a risk-aware auxiliary task
to maintain a striking balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk.
Through extensive experiments on real-world market data spanning over three
years on six financial futures, we demonstrate that DeepScalper significantly
outperforms many state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four financial
criteria.
