emerged as a strong continual learner due to its non-parametric ability to
tackle task interference and catastrophic forgetting. Unfortunately its success
comes at the expense of an explicit memory to store samples from past tasks,
which hampers scalability to continual learning settings with a large number of
tasks. In this paper, we introduce generative kernel continual learning, which
explores and exploits the synergies between generative models and kernels for
continual learning. The generative model is able to produce representative
samples for kernel learning, which removes the dependence on memory in kernel
continual learning. Moreover, as we replay only on the generative model, we
avoid task interference while being computationally more efficient compared to
previous methods that need replay on the entire model. We further introduce a
supervised contrastive regularization, which enables our model to generate even
more discriminative samples for better kernel-based classification performance.
We conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used continual learning
benchmarks that demonstrate the abilities and benefits of our contributions.
Most notably, on the challenging SplitCIFAR100 benchmark, with just a simple
linear kernel we obtain the same accuracy as kernel continual learning with
variational random features for one tenth of the memory, or a 10.1\% accuracy
gain for the same memory budget.

to the recently studied Low Rank Compressive Sensing (LRCS) problem: recover an
nxq low-rank matrix from column-wise linear projections. An important
application where this problem occurs, and a decentralized solution is
desirable is in federated sketching: efficiently compressing the vast amounts
of distributed images/videos generated by smartphones and various other devices
while respecting the users' privacy. Images from different devices, once
grouped by category, are similar and hence the matrix formed by the vectorized
images of a certain category is well-modeled as being low rank. Suppose there
are p nodes (say p smartphones), and each store a subset of the sketches of its
images. We develop a decentralized projected gradient descent (GD) based
approach to jointly reconstruct the images of all the phones/users from their
respective stored sketches. The algorithm is such that the phones/users never
share their raw data but only summaries of this data with the other phones at
each algorithm iteration. Also, the reconstructed images of user g are obtained
only locally. Other users cannot reconstruct them. Only the column span of the
matrix is reconstructed globally. By ""decentralized"" we mean that there is no
central node to which all nodes are connected and thus the only way to
aggregate the summaries from the various nodes is by use of an iterative
consensus algorithm that eventually provides an estimate of the aggregate at
each node, as long as the network is strongly connected. We validated the
effectiveness of our algorithm via extensive simulation experiments.

characterize expressed perceived emotions. Many SER application systems often
acquire and transmit speech data collected at the client-side to remote cloud
platforms for inference and decision making. However, speech data carry rich
information not only about emotions conveyed in vocal expressions, but also
other sensitive demographic traits such as gender, age and language background.
Consequently, it is desirable for SER systems to have the ability to classify
emotion constructs while preventing unintended/improper inferences of sensitive
and demographic information. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine
learning paradigm that coordinates clients to train a model collaboratively
without sharing their local data. This training approach appears secure and can
improve privacy for SER. However, recent works have demonstrated that FL
approaches are still vulnerable to various privacy attacks like reconstruction
attacks and membership inference attacks. Although most of these have focused
on computer vision applications, such information leakages exist in the SER
systems trained using the FL technique. To assess the information leakage of
SER systems trained using FL, we propose an attribute inference attack
framework that infers sensitive attribute information of the clients from
shared gradients or model parameters, corresponding to the FedSGD and the
FedAvg training algorithms, respectively. As a use case, we empirically
evaluate our approach for predicting the client's gender information using
three SER benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, CREMA-D, and MSP-Improv. We show that
the attribute inference attack is achievable for SER systems trained using FL.
We further identify that most information leakage possibly comes from the first
layer in the SER model.

of $\kappa_L$, the so-called spin-orbit parameter, and Rabi frequency
($\Omega$) leads to two distinct regions in the system's energy spectrum with
different order parameters and/or probability densities. In addition, we can
have a spatially modulated density profile, reminiscent of the so called stripe
phase. Our numbers for $S$ and $I$ demonstrate that for $\kappa_L^2<\Omega$
(region 1) the density profile becomes localized as $\kappa_L$ increases while
we observe delocalization in the density distribution for $\kappa_L^2>\Omega$
(region 2) for increasing values of $\kappa_L$. In the stripe phase the nature
of $S$ and $I$ to changes in $\kappa_L$ is similar to that found for the
condensate in region 2. The results for information theoretic quantities in the

particular, the highly enhanced values of position-space Fisher information
imply an extremely concentrated atomic density distribution to provide an

event centred around $\sim$+273d, which coincides with a phase of coronal line
emission. The dust mass is found to be $\sim0.83-1.25 \times 10^{-10}

created by shock heating rather than by photoionization. The simultaneous
occurrence of the dust and coronal lines (with varying velocity shifts)
supports the possibility that dust formation is shock-induced. Such a route for
dust formation has not previously been seen in a nova, although the mechanism
has been proposed for dust formation in some core-collapse supernovae. Analysis
of the coronal lines indicates a gas mass and temperature of

Recently pre-trained language models (PLMs) show effectiveness as an

However, existing work either relies on large-scale in-domain or out-of-domain

emergence of ferroelectricity for HfO2-based materials, but the underlying
mechanism still remains elusive. Herein, starting from the basic
characterization circuit, we propose that the observed ferroelectricity is
extrinsic. A key finding is that charged oxygen vacancies oscillate within the
sample under repeated electric pulses, yielding a nonlinear current which
behaves similarly to the polarization current for a normal ferroelectric. This
unwanted current signal results in a ferroelectric-like hysteresis loop with
both remnant polarization and coercive field in good agreements with
experimental values, given a charged oxygen vacancy concentration in the
vicinity of 1*10^20/cm^3. Moreover, it is possible to exploit this mechanism to
reproduce the effects of wake-up, split-up and limited endurance that are of
crucial relevance for the device applications.

(collagen, predominantly) and liquid phases. Understanding the interaction
between such components and how they change under physiological loading sets
the basis for elucidating the essential link between their internal structure
and mechanical behaviour. In fact, the internal heterogeneous structure of this
kind of tissues leads to a wide range of mechanical behaviours, which then
determine their own function(s). Characterising these behaviours implies an
important experimental effort in terms of tissue harvesting, samples
preparation and implementation of testing protocols - which, often, are not
standardised. These issues lead to several difficulties in both collecting and
providing comparable and reliable information. In order to model the behaviours
of heterogeneous tissues and identify material parameters, a large volume of
reproducible experimental data is required; unfortunately, such an amount of
information is often not available. In reality, most of the studies that are
focused on the identification of material parameters, are largely based on
small sets of experimental data, which present a large variability. Such a
large variability opens on to uncertainties in the estimation of material
parameters, as reported in the literature. Hence, the use of a rigorous
probabilistic framework, that is able to address uncertainties due to paucity
of data, is of paramount importance in the field of biomechanics; in this
perspective, Bayesian inference represents a promising approach. This study was

gradients, from the EDs are represented with the pulse-position modulation
(PPM) symbols constructed with discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-spread
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) (DFT-s-OFDM). By taking the
delay spread and time-synchronization errors into account, the MV at the ES is
obtained with an energy detector. Hence, the proposed scheme does not require
CSI at the EDs and ES. We also prove the convergence of the distributed
training when the MV is obtained with the proposed scheme under fading channel.
Through simulations, we show that the proposed scheme provides a high test
accuracy in fading channels while resulting in lower peak-to-mean envelope

clinical imaging modalities for non-invasive diagnosis. However, both of these
modalities come with certain problems. CT uses harmful ionising radiation, and
MRI suffers from slow acquisition speed. Both problems can be tackled by
undersampling, such as sparse sampling. However, such undersampled data leads
to lower resolution and introduces artefacts. Several techniques, including
deep learning based methods, have been proposed to reconstruct such data.
However, the undersampled reconstruction problem for these two modalities was
always considered as two different problems and tackled separately by different
research works. This paper proposes a unified solution for both sparse CT and
undersampled radial MRI reconstruction, achieved by applying Fourier
transform-based pre-processing on the radial MRI and then finally
reconstructing both modalities using sinogram upsampling combined with filtered
back-projection. The Primal-Dual network is a deep learning based method for
reconstructing sparsely-sampled CT data. This paper introduces Primal-Dual
UNet, which improves the Primal-Dual network in terms of accuracy and
reconstruction speed. The proposed method resulted in an average SSIM of
0.932\textpm0.021 while performing sparse CT reconstruction for fan-beam

of human life historically. Earthquake prediction is an essential aspect of any
society's plans and can increase public preparedness and reduce damage to a
great extent. Nevertheless, due to the stochastic character of earthquakes and
the challenge of achieving an efficient and dependable model for earthquake
prediction, efforts have been insufficient thus far, and new methods are
required to solve this problem. Aware of these issues, this paper proposes a
novel prediction method based on attention mechanism (AM), convolution neural
network (CNN), and bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) models, which
can predict the number and maximum magnitude of earthquakes in each area of
mainland China-based on the earthquake catalog of the region. This model takes
advantage of LSTM and CNN with an attention mechanism to better focus on
effective earthquake characteristics and produce more accurate predictions.
Firstly, the zero-order hold technique is applied as pre-processing on
earthquake data, making the model's input data more proper. Secondly, to
effectively use spatial information and reduce dimensions of input data, the
CNN is used to capture the spatial dependencies between earthquake data.
Thirdly, the Bi-LSTM layer is employed to capture the temporal dependencies.
Fourthly, the AM layer is introduced to highlight its important features to
achieve better prediction performance. The results show that the proposed
method has better performance and generalize ability than other prediction
methods.

Kac-Rice approach combined with the Random Matrix Theory for Wishart Ensemble,
and then perform its asymptotic analysis as $N\to \infty$ at a fixed

extract the Large Deviation Function for the density of the smallest Lagrange
multiplier $\lambda_{min}$ associated with the problem, and in this way to find
its most probable value. This can be further used to predict the asymptotic
minimal value ${\cal E}_{min}$ of the loss function as $N\to \infty$. Finally,
we develop an alternative approach based on the replica trick to conjecture the
form of the Large Deviation function for the density of ${\cal E}_{min}$ at

agent. Our main objective is to establish what features of the model of the
mobile agent and the environment allow linear exploration time. We study agents
that, upon entering to a node, do not receive as input the edge via which they
entered. In such a model, deterministic memoryless exploration is infeasible,
hence the agent needs to be allowed to use some memory. The memory can be
located at the agent or at each node. The existing lower bounds show that if
the memory is either only at the agent or only at the nodes, then the
exploration needs superlinear time. We show that tree exploration in
dual-memory model, with constant memory at the agent and logarithmic at each
node is possible in linear time when one of two additional features is present:
fixed initial state of the memory at each node (so called clean memory) or a
single movable token. We present two algorithms working in linear time for
arbitrary trees in these two models. On the other hand, in our lower bound we
show that if the agent has a single bit of memory and one bit is present at
each node, then exploration may require quadratic time on paths, if the initial
memory at nodes could be set arbitrarily (so called dirty memory). This shows
that having clean node memory or a token allows linear exploration of trees in
the model with two types of memory, but having neither of those features may
lead to quadratic exploration time even on a simple path.

  General Interconnects","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2105.08784",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electromigration (EM) is a key reliability issue in deeply scaled technology
nodes. Traditional EM methods first filter immortal wires using the Blech
criterion, and then perform EM analysis based on Black's equation on the
remaining wires. The Blech criterion is based on finding the steady-state
stress in a two-terminal wire segment, but most on-chip structures are
considerably more complex. Current-density-based assessment methodologies,
i.e., Black's equation and the Blech criterion, which are predominantly used to
detect EM-susceptible wires, do not capture the physics of EM, but alternative
physics-based methods involve the solution of differential equations and are
slow. This paper uses first principles, based on solving fundamental stress
equations that relate electron wind and back-stress forces to the stress
evolution in an interconnect, and devises a technique that analyzes any general
tree or mesh interconnect structure to test for immortality. The resulting
solution is extremely computationally efficient and its computation time is
linear in the number of metal segments. Two variants of the method are
proposed: a current-density-based method that requires traversals of the
interconnect graph, and a voltage-based formulation negates the need for any
traversals. The methods are applied to large interconnect networks for
determining the steady-state stress at all nodes and test all segments of each
network for immortality. The proposed model is applied to a variety of tree and
mesh structures and is demonstrated to be fast. By construction, it is an exact
solution and it is demonstrated to match much more computationally expensive
numerical simulations.

theory, is a class of non-uniform probability measures on the symmetric group
$S_n$. The model depends on a distance metric $d(\sigma,\tau)$ on $S_n$, which
can be chosen from a host of metrics on permutations. In this paper, we focus
on Mallows permutation models with $L^1$ and $L^2$ distances, respectively
known in the statistics literature as Spearman's footrule and Spearman's rank
correlation.
  Unlike most of the random permutation models that have been analyzed in the
literature, Mallows permutation models with $L^1$ and $L^2$ distances do not
have an explicit expression for their normalizing constants. This poses
challenges to the task of sampling from these Mallows models. In this paper, we
consider hit and run algorithms for sampling from both models. Hit and run
algorithms are a unifying class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms
including the celebrated Swendsen-Wang and data augmentation algorithms. For
both models, we show order $\log{n}$ mixing time upper bounds for the hit and
run algorithms. This demonstrates much faster mixing of the hit and run
algorithms compared to local MCMC algorithms such as the Metropolis algorithm.
The proof of the results on mixing times is based on the path coupling
technique, for which a novel coupling for permutations with one-sided
restrictions is involved.
  Extensions of the hit and run algorithms to weighted versions of the above
models, a two-parameter permutation model that involves the $L^1$ distance and
Cayley distance, and lattice permutation models in dimensions greater than or
equal to $2$ are also discussed. The order $\log{n}$ mixing time upper bound

applied local scanning to identify finer details, but needed another global

regular cubes in which fluid particles are activated by boundary velocities of
parallel and nonparallel to the the longitudinal direction and a random
Brownian force with strength $D$. We find that for finite $D$, the velocity

arena, as the frequent emergence of cardiotoxicity from many approved drugs led

optimization model for Transmission System Operators (TSO) to clear real-time
energy markets while ensuring reliable operations of power grids. In a context
of growing operational uncertainty, due to increased penetration of renewable
generators and distributed energy resources, operators must continuously
monitor risk in real-time, i.e., they must quickly assess the system's behavior
under various changes in load and renewable production. Unfortunately,
systematically solving an optimization problem for each such scenario is not
practical given the tight constraints of real-time operations. To overcome this
limitation, this paper proposes to learn an optimization proxy for SCED, i.e.,
a Machine Learning (ML) model that can predict an optimal solution for SCED in
milliseconds. Motivated by a principled analysis of the market-clearing
optimizations of MISO, the paper proposes a novel ML pipeline that addresses
the main challenges of learning SCED solutions, i.e., the variability in load,
renewable output and production costs, as well as the combinatorial structure
of commitment decisions. A novel Classification-Then-Regression architecture is
also proposed, to further capture the behavior of SCED solutions. Numerical
experiments are reported on the French transmission system, and demonstrate the
approach's ability to produce, within a time frame that is compatible with
real-time operations, accurate optimization proxies that produce relative
errors below $0.6\%$.

implemented in the chain of coupled semiconductor quantum dots. Indeed highly

transistor gates as well as external magnetic field. Using anti-correlation
principle arising from Coulomb repulsion interaction between electrons one can
implement classical and quantum inverter (Classical/Quantum Swap gate) and many

quantumness of physical process is bringing coexistence of correlation and
anti-correlation at the same time. One of the central results presented in this

observe strong localization of wave-packet due to nanowire bending. The

weakly coupled moire potential-well states inside a wide band gap, and can be
realized over a broad range of twist angles. The average group velocity of the

based on Hierarchical Transformer (VJMHT) for co-summarization, which takes

representation from individual shots of similar videos, while the second layer
performs shot-level video joint modelling to aggregate cross-video semantic
information. By this means, complete cross-video high-level patterns are
explicitly modelled and learned for the summarization of individual videos.
Moreover, Transformer-based video representation reconstruction is introduced
to maximize the high-level similarity between the summary and the original
video. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed modules and the superiority of VJMHT in terms of F-measure and

changepoints in the factor structure of large matrix time series. Our approach
is based on the well-known fact that, in the presence of a changepoint, a
factor model can be rewritten as a model with a larger number of common
factors. In turn, this entails that, in the presence of a changepoint, the
number of spiked eigenvalues in the second moment matrix of the data increases.
Based on this, we propose two families of procedures - one based on the
fluctuations of partial sums, and one based on extreme value theory - to
monitor whether the first non-spiked eigenvalue diverges after a point in time
in the monitoring horizon, thereby indicating the presence of a changepoint.
Our procedure is based only on rates; at each point in time, we randomise the
estimated eigenvalue, thus obtaining a normally distributed sequence which is
$i.i.d.$ with mean zero under the null of no break, whereas it diverges to
positive infinity in the presence of a changepoint. We base our monitoring
procedures on such sequence. Extensive simulation studies and empirical
analysis justify the theory.

The emergence of novel magnetism, such as the row-wise AFM in Mn/Cu(111) and

competitions in realistic material systems. By utilizing advanced many-body
techniques, we systematically studied the isotropic triangular Hubbard model
with second nearest-neighbor hopping $t^{\prime}$, including both the single-
and the two-particle responses. We found that both electronic and magnetic
phase transitions show a clear dependence on $t^{\prime}/t$. Consequently, we
observed a remarkable reentrance of the metal-insulator transition and a
crossover between the $120^{\circ}$- and the row-wise AFM. The Fermi surface
(FS) shows two distinct structures with the nesting vectors consistent with the
magnetic correlations. When $t^{\prime}$ evolves from 0 to 1, the correlated
Fermi surface demonstrates a Lifschitz transition between the two nesting
structures, and exotic phases like the featureless insulating state can be
realized. Our work sheds light on the engineering of electronic and magnetic
correlations of correlated triangular surfaces via longer-range hopping. The
rich phase diagram and the high degree of tunability make the triangular

from bandit problems to reinforcement learning, is to provide sample-efficient,
adaptive learning algorithms that achieve near-optimal regret. This question is
analogous to the classical problem of optimal (supervised) statistical
learning, where there are well-known complexity measures (e.g., VC dimension
and Rademacher complexity) that govern the statistical complexity of learning.
However, characterizing the statistical complexity of interactive learning is
substantially more challenging due to the adaptive nature of the problem. The
main result of this work provides a complexity measure, the Decision-Estimation
Coefficient, that is proven to be both necessary and sufficient for
sample-efficient interactive learning. In particular, we provide:
  1. a lower bound on the optimal regret for any interactive decision making
problem, establishing the Decision-Estimation Coefficient as a fundamental
limit.
  2. a unified algorithm design principle, Estimation-to-Decisions (E2D), which
transforms any algorithm for supervised estimation into an online algorithm for
decision making. E2D attains a regret bound matching our lower bound, thereby
achieving optimal sample-efficient learning as characterized by the
Decision-Estimation Coefficient.
  Taken together, these results constitute a theory of learnability for
interactive decision making. When applied to reinforcement learning settings,
the Decision-Estimation Coefficient recovers essentially all existing hardness
results and lower bounds. More broadly, the approach can be viewed as a
decision-theoretic analogue of the classical Le Cam theory of statistical
estimation; it also unifies a number of existing approaches -- both Bayesian
and frequentist.

tree root inspection. Estimating root-related parameters from GPR radargrams
greatly facilitates root health monitoring and imaging. However, the task of
estimating root-related parameters is challenging as the root reflection is a
complex function of multiple root parameters and root orientations. Existing
methods can only estimate a single root parameter at a time without considering
the influence of other parameters and root orientations, resulting in limited
estimation accuracy under different root conditions. In addition, soil
heterogeneity introduces clutter in GPR radargrams, making the data processing
and interpretation even harder. To address these issues, a novel neural network
architecture, called mask-guided multi-polarimetric integration neural network
(MMI-Net), is proposed to automatically and simultaneously estimate multiple
root-related parameters in heterogeneous soil environments. The MMI-Net
includes two sub-networks: a MaskNet that predicts a mask to highlight the root
reflection area to eliminate interfering environmental clutter, and a ParaNet
that uses the predicted mask as guidance to integrate, extract, and emphasize
informative features in multi-polarimetric radargrams for accurate estimation
of five key root-related parameters. The parameters include the root depth,
diameter, relative permittivity, horizontal and vertical orientation angles.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MMI-Net achieves high
estimation accuracy in these root-related parameters. This is the first work
that takes the combined contributions of root parameters and spatial
orientations into account and simultaneously estimates multiple root-related

in average outcome by treatment group is an estimate of the average effect of
the treatment. However, motivating our study, the setting for modern
experiments is often different, with the outcomes and treatment assignments
indexed by multiple populations. For example, outcomes may be indexed by buyers
and sellers, by content creators and subscribers, by drivers and riders, or by
travelers and airlines and travel agents, with treatments potentially varying
across these indices. Spillovers or interference can arise from interactions
between units across populations. For example, sellers' behavior may depend on
buyers' treatment assignment, or vice versa. This can invalidate the simple

  This study evaluates machine learning classifiers performance on feedback for

Using seven datasets from prior research studies, we investigate the
performance of classifiers when evaluated on feedback from different apps than
those contained in the training set and when evaluated on completely different

understanding of the number of fermion species (doublers) on lattices with

One finds zero eigenvalues of the matrix by use of the discrete Fourier

groups is both conceptually natural and practically well-used. In a landmark
paper, Abadie and Imbens (2006) provided the first large-sample analysis of NN
matching under, however, a crucial assumption that the number of NNs, $M$, is
fixed. This manuscript reveals something new out of their study and shows that,
once allowing $M$ to diverge with the sample size, an intrinsic statistic in
their analysis actually constitutes a consistent estimator of the density
ratio. Furthermore, through selecting a suitable $M$, this statistic can attain
the minimax lower bound of estimation over a Lipschitz density function class.
Consequently, with a diverging $M$, the NN matching provably yields a doubly
robust estimator of the average treatment effect and is semiparametrically
efficient if the density functions are sufficiently smooth and the outcome

overcome this problem, we propose a hybrid high-performance deep learning model

generated by the convolutional neural network (CNN) significantly enhance the
Transformer global modeling. Turning multi-stage spatial features as global
attention guidance, this design combines the robustness from the inductive bias

Application

class-imbalance problem in the form of a vast difference in the sample sizes of
different classes. They usually have class overlap problems. This study used a
capsule network for the anomaly detection task. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first instance where a capsule network is analyzed for the anomaly
detection task in a high-dimensional complex data setting. We also handle the
related novelty and outlier detection problems. The architecture of the capsule
network was suitably modified for a binary classification task. Capsule
networks offer a good option for detecting anomalies due to the effect of
viewpoint invariance captured in its predictions and viewpoint equivariance
captured in internal capsule architecture. We used six-layered under-complete
autoencoder architecture with second and third layers containing capsules. The
capsules were trained using the dynamic routing algorithm. We created
$10$-imbalanced datasets from the original MNIST dataset and compared the
performance of the capsule network with $5$ baseline models. Our leading test
set measures are F1-score for minority class and area under the ROC curve. We
found that the capsule network outperformed every other baseline model on the

any other data level and algorithm level approach. Thus, we conclude that
capsule networks are excellent in modeling complex high-dimensional imbalanced

complement the sparsity of point features, making it possible to map the
surrounding environment structure. Existing approaches utilizing line features
have primarily employed a measurement model that uses line re-projection.
However, the direction vectors used in the 3D line mapping process cannot be
corrected because the line measurement model employs only the lines' normal
vectors in the Pl\""{u}cker coordinate. As a result, problems like degeneracy
that occur during the 3D line mapping process cannot be solved. To tackle the
problem, this paper presents a UV-SLAM, which is an unconstrained line-based
SLAM using vanishing points for structural mapping. This paper focuses on using
structural regularities without any constraints, such as the Manhattan world
assumption. For this, we use the vanishing points that can be obtained from the
line features. The difference between the vanishing point observation
calculated through line features in the image and the vanishing point
estimation calculated through the direction vector is defined as a residual and
added to the cost function of optimization-based SLAM. Furthermore, through
Fisher information matrix rank analysis, we prove that vanishing point
measurements guarantee a unique mapping solution. Finally, we demonstrate that
the localization accuracy and mapping quality are improved compared to the
state-of-the-art algorithms using public datasets.

helioseismic sensitivity kernels for flows using line-of-sight projected

spherical harmonics and computed the kernel components corresponding to the
coefficients of velocity in this basis. The kernels thus computed are radial
functions that set up a 1.5D inverse problem to infer the flow from surface
measurements. I demonstrate that using the angular momentum addition formalism
lets us express the angular dependence of the kernels as bipolar spherical
harmonics, which may be evaluated accurately and efficiently. Results: Kernels
for line-of-sight projected measurements may differ significantly from those
that don't account for projection. Including projection in our analysis does
not increase the computational time significantly. We demonstrate that it is
possible to evaluate kernels for pairs of points that are related through a

vision transformer with latent variables following an informative energy-based
prior for salient object detection. Both the vision transformer network and the
energy-based prior model are jointly trained via Markov chain Monte Carlo-based
maximum likelihood estimation, in which the sampling from the intractable
posterior and prior distributions of the latent variables are performed by
Langevin dynamics. Further, with the generative vision transformer, we can
easily obtain a pixel-wise uncertainty map from an image, which indicates the
model confidence in predicting saliency from the image. Different from the
existing generative models which define the prior distribution of the latent
variables as a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution, our model uses an
energy-based informative prior which can be more expressive to capture the
latent space of the data. We apply the proposed framework to both RGB and RGB-D
salient object detection tasks. Extensive experimental results show that our
framework can achieve not only accurate saliency predictions but also
meaningful uncertainty maps that are consistent with the human perception.

is updated by temporal-difference (TD) learning with a larger stepsize while
the actor is updated via proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a smaller

classification, as a parallel to ViT. By splitting each image into a sequence
of tokens with fixed length, the ViR constructs a pure reservoir with a nearly
fully connected topology to replace the Transformer module in ViT. Two kinds of
deep ViR models are subsequently proposed to enhance the network performance.
Comparative experiments between the ViR and the ViT are carried out on several
image classification benchmarks. Without any pre-training process, the ViR
outperforms the ViT in terms of both model and computational complexity.
Specifically, the number of parameters of the ViR is about 15% even 5% of the
ViT, and the memory footprint is about 20% to 40% of the ViT. The superiority
of the ViR performance is explained by Small-World characteristics, Lyapunov
exponents, and memory capacity.

generalization of superintegrable Euclidean Hamiltonian systems to curved ones.
These models are defined based on curved Hamiltonians, which depend on a
deformation parameter of underlying space and involve reflection operators.
Their symmetries are obtained by the Jordan-Schwinger representations in the
family of the Cayley-Klein orthogonal algebras using the creation and
annihilation operators of the dynamical $sl_{-1}(2)$ algebra of the
one-dimensional Dunkl oscillator. The resulting algebra is a deformation of
$so_{\kappa_1\kappa_2}(4)$ with reflections, which is known as the
Jordan-Schwinger-Dunkl algebra $jsd_{\kappa_1\kappa_2}(4)$. Hence, this model
is shown to be maximally superintegrable. On the other hand, the
superintegrability of the three-dimensional Dunkl oscillator model is studied
from the factorization approach viewpoint. The spectrum of this system is
derived through the separation of variables in geodesic polar coordinates, and
the resulting eigenfunctions are algebraically given in terms of Jacobi
polynomials.

Ising chains. In such asymmetric superconducting chains, by the change of
chemical potential, its ground state undergoes a topological quantum phase
transition from the topological Majorana bound state to the trivial Andreev
bound state while the ground state energy remains zero. We solve the exact
transient transport current and the corresponding differential conductance. The
results show that the presence or absence of the interference between the left

transition of conductance. It cause the edge-localized topologically trivial
states to be insulated with zero conductance, while the nonlocally distributed
topologically nontrivial states always have a quantized conductance 2e^2/h.
This dramatic change associated with topological phase transition for zero-mode

However, two key challenges remain. Firstly, accounting for the magnitude of
the measured effect in light of the weak spin-orbit coupling in organic
systems. Secondly, understanding its observation not only in
tunneling-dominated short molecules, but also in longer ones where
phonon-assisted hopping via localized states is operative. We focus on the
latter and find that localization and the complete loss of coherence due to
phonons do not impede strong spin polarization of charge carriers passing

observing spin-selective transport from the magnitude of the spin-orbit

fields due to their significant power on processing graph-structured data.
Typical GCN and its variants work under a homophily assumption (i.e., nodes
with same class are prone to connect to each other), while ignoring the
heterophily which exists in many real-world networks (i.e., nodes with
different classes tend to form edges). Existing methods deal with heterophily
by mainly aggregating higher-order neighborhoods or combing the immediate
representations, which leads to noise and irrelevant information in the result.
But these methods did not change the propagation mechanism which works under
homophily assumption (that is a fundamental part of GCNs). This makes it
difficult to distinguish the representation of nodes from different classes. To
address this problem, in this paper we design a novel propagation mechanism,
which can automatically change the propagation and aggregation process
according to homophily or heterophily between node pairs. To adaptively learn
the propagation process, we introduce two measurements of homophily degree
between node pairs, which is learned based on topological and attribute
information, respectively. Then we incorporate the learnable homophily degree
into the graph convolution framework, which is trained in an end-to-end schema,
enabling it to go beyond the assumption of homophily. More importantly, we
theoretically prove that our model can constrain the similarity of
representations between nodes according to their homophily degree. Experiments
on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that this new approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods under heterophily or low homophily, and gains
competitive performance under homophily.

superconductor is expected to serve as an experimental platform to display
Majorana zero modes. By rederiving its effective Kitaev model with spins, we
discover a novel topological phase diagram, which assigns a more precise
constraint on the magnetic field strength for the emergence of Majorana zero
modes. It then turns out the effective pairing strength dressed by the
proximity effect exhibits a significant dependence on the magnetic field, and
thus the topological phase region is refined as a closed triangle in the phase
diagram with chemical potential vs. Zeeman energy(which is obviously different
from the open hyperbolic region known before). This prediction is confirmed
again by an exact calculation of quantum transport, where the zero bias peak of
$2e^{2}/h$ in the differential conductance spectrum, as the necessary evidence
for the Majorana zero modes, disappears when the magnetic field grows too
strong. For illustrations with practical hybrid systems, in the InSb nanowire
coupled to NbTiN, the accessible magnetic field range is around 0.1--1.5T; when
coupled to aluminum shell, the accessible magnetic field range should be
smaller than 0.12T. These predictions obviously clarify the current
controversial issues about some experiments of Majorana zero modes with hybrid

design that involves a recently proposed extension of the weighted prediction

expansion (VACE)-WPE. It is demonstrated experimentally in this study that
unlike the conventional WPE algorithm, the VACE-WPE can be explicitly trained
to cancel out both late reverberation and background noise. To build the
front-end, the VACE-WPE is first independently (pre)trained to produce ""noisy""
dereverberated signals. Subsequently, given a pretrained speaker embedding
model, the VACE-WPE is additionally fine-tuned within a task-specific
optimization (TSO) framework, causing the speaker embedding extracted from the
processed signal to be similar to that extracted from the ""noise-free"" target
signal. Moreover, to extend the application of the proposed front-end to more
general, unconstrained ""in-the-wild"" ASV scenarios beyond controlled far-field
conditions, we propose a distortion regularization method for the VACE-WPE
within the TSO framework. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
verified on both far-field and in-the-wild ASV benchmarks, demonstrating its

Although some theoretical breakthroughs allow us to identify all driver nodes,
we still lack an efficient method to identify the driver nodes and understand
the roles of individual nodes in contributing to the control of a large complex
network. Here, we apply a leaf removal process (LRP) to find a substructure of
an undirected network, which is considered as the control core of the original
network. Based on a strict mathematical proof, the control core obtained by the
LRP has the same controllability as the original network, and it contains at
least one set of driver nodes. With this method, we systematically investigate
the structural property of the control core with respect to different average
degrees of the original networks ($\langle k \rangle$). We denote the node
density ($n_\text{core}$) and link density ($l_\text{core}$) to characterize
the control core when applying the LRP, and we study the impact of $\langle k
\rangle$ on $n_\text{core}$ and $l_\text{core}$ in two artificial networks:
undirected Erd\""os-R\'enyi (ER) random networks and undirected scale-free (SF)
networks. We find that $n_\text{core}$ and $l_\text{core}$ both change
nonmonotonously with increasing $\langle k \rangle$ in the two typical
undirected networks. With the aid of core percolation theory, we can offer the
theoretical predictions for both $n_\text{core}$ and $l_\text{core}$ as a
function of $\langle k \rangle$. Then, we recognize that finding the driver
nodes in the control core is much more efficient than in the original network
by comparing $n_{\text{D}}$, the controllability of the original network, and
$n_{\text{core}}$, regardless of how $\langle k \rangle$ increases.

assumption is apparently too harsh to be verified. For example, in the
practical application, including financial analysis, reliability analysis,
survival analysis and social network analysis, the base intensity of the truth
conditional intensity function is very likely to be time-varying. The constant
base intensity will not reflect the base probability of the failure occurring
over time. Thus, in order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a

our method can learn the triggering patterns of the Hawkes processes and the

on diverse applications on real-world datasets. To improve the model capacity
and alleviate the over-smoothing problem, several methods proposed to
incorporate the intermediate layers by layer-wise connections. However, due to
the highly diverse graph types, the performance of existing methods vary on
diverse graphs, leading to a need for data-specific layer-wise connection
methods. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework LLC (Learn
Layer-wise Connections) based on neural architecture search (NAS) to learn
adaptive connections among intermediate layers in GNNs. LLC contains one novel
search space which consists of 3 types of blocks and learnable connections, and
one differentiable search algorithm to enable the efficient search process.
Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets are conducted, and the
results show that the searched layer-wise connections can not only improve the

spanning $0.09\lesssim A_{Ks}\lesssim 0.86$ mag and $0.89 \lesssim
A_{G}\lesssim 4.72$ mag in the NIR and optical, respectively. We obtain their
heliocentric distances, that range from about 4 to 20 kpc, placing these
clusters at $3\lesssim R_{G}\lesssim 14$ kpc from the Galactic centre. The best
PARSEC isochrone fit yields a metallicity range of $-1.8<$[Fe/H]$<+0.3$ and an
approximative age range of $2<$Age$<14$ Gyr. We find that all clusters have
low-luminosities, with $-6.9<M_{V}<-3.5$ mag. Based on our photometric

Patchick125 as a metal-poor GC, Ferrero54 as a metal-rich GC, and ESO92-18 as a
possible old OC or young GC. The classification as GC candidates is also

first extract semantic information from social media and estimate their

incorporate the semantic from online posts and numeric features from historical

that our method improves the performance of stock movements prediction and

distortion constraint. Specifically, we assume the following game between Alice
and Bob: Alice has a sequence $\bx$ of length $n$. Bob wishes to guess $\bx$,
yet he is satisfied with finding any sequence $\hat{\bx}$ which is within a
given distortion $D$ from $\bx$. Thus, he successively submits queries to
Alice, until receiving an affirmative answer, stating that his guess was within
the required distortion.
  Finding guessing strategies which minimize the number of guesses (the
\emph{guesswork}), and analyzing its properties (e.g., its $\rho$--th moment)
has several applications in information security, source and channel coding.
Guessing subject to a distortion constraint is especially useful when
considering contemporary biometrically--secured systems, where the ""password""
which protects the data is not a single, fixed vector but rather a \emph{ball
of feature vectors} centered at some $\bx$, and any feature vector within the
ball results in acceptance.
  We formally define the guessing problem under distortion in \emph{four
different setups}: memoryless sources, guessing through a noisy channel,
sources with memory and individual sequences. We suggest a randomized guessing
strategy which is asymptotically optimal for all setups and is \emph{five--fold
universal}, as it is independent of the source statistics, the channel, the
moment to be optimized, the distortion measure and the distortion level.

that involves the integration over the slab of the ensemble average of the
stress-energy-momentum tensor calculated long ago by Brown and Maclay. Both
thermodynamic regimes $kTd/\hbar c\gg 1$ and $kTd/\hbar c\ll 1$ are fully

ill defined (or trivial) in ordinary blackbody thermodynamics are now well
defined (or nontrivial) due to presence of boundary conditions at the walls of

fully explored and it is speculated that they may be experimentally checked.
Stability is addressed, showing that electromagnetic radiation in the slab is
thermally stable; but mechanically unstable. We investigate thermodynamic
processes where temperature, internal energy, entropy and enthalpy are each
taken to be constant, revealing rather atypical behaviors. For example, in
sharp contrast with what one would expect from a gas, when $kTd/\hbar c\ll 1$,
""free expansion"" gives place to ""free contraction'' in accordance with the
second law of thermodynamics. As a check of consistency of the formulae we
remark that various Carnot cycles have been examined and verified that they

type of sound source in computational ocean acoustics. The exciting waveguide
in a range-dependent ocean environment is often structurally complicated;
however, traditional algorithms often assume that the waveguide has a simple
seabed boundary and that the line source is located at a horizontal range of 0
m, although this ideal situation is rarely encountered in the actual ocean. In
this paper, a novel algorithm is designed that can solve for the sound field
excited by a line source at any position in a range-dependent ocean

approach to address the range dependence of the environment and uses the
Chebyshev--Tau spectral method to solve for the horizontal wavenumbers and
modes of approximately range-independent segments. Once the modal information
of these flat segments has been obtained, a global matrix is constructed to
solve for the coupling coefficients of all segments, and finally, the complete

(FL) over wireless medium has emerged as a promising technology for large-scale
distributed intelligent systems. Yet, the urgent demand for ubiquitous
intelligence will generate a large number of concurrent FL tasks, which may
seriously aggravate the scarcity of communication resources. By exploiting the
analog superposition of electromagnetic waves, over-the-air computation
(AirComp) is an appealing solution to alleviate the burden of communication
required by FL. However, sharing frequency-time resources in over-the-air
computation inevitably brings about the problem of inter-task interference,
which poses a new challenge that needs to be appropriately addressed. In this
paper, we study over-the-air federated multi-task learning (OA-FMTL) over the
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access (MAC) channel. We propose
a novel model aggregation method for the alignment of local gradients of
different devices, which alleviates the straggler problem in over-the-air
computation due to the channel heterogeneity. We establish a
communication-learning analysis framework for the proposed OA-FMTL scheme by
considering the spatial correlation between devices, and formulate an
optimization problem for the design of transceiver beamforming and device
selection. To solve this problem, we develop an algorithm by using alternating
optimization (AO) and fractional programming (FP), which effectively mitigates
the impact of inter-task interference on the FL learning performance. We show
that due to the use of the new model aggregation method, device selection is no
longer essential, thereby avoiding the heavy computational burden involved in

indicating that the efficiency of the Rayleigh--Raman scattering has noticeably
decreased. A high-velocity [N\,{\sc ii}] nebular component detected in 1993 is
missing in 2019 and 2020, probably due to a decrease in its electron density. A
correlation exists between the strength of the stellar wind and the episodic

graphene (TBG) in various kinds of situations. First, we study the equilibrium
case and identify the interlayer hopping processes that are most crucial for
the appearance of a Hofstadter butterfly. Surprisingly, the hopping processes
that are important for the appearance of the Hofstadter butterfly can be
categorized as AA stacking type - that is interlayer hoppings between
equivalent sublattices. This is in contrast to AB/BA-type hoppings that are
important for the appearance of flat bands in magic angle TBG and were
discussed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 106405 (2019)]. We also find that if
AB-type interlayer-hopping processes are turned off the resulting model is
chiral but differs from the model discussed in \cite{Tarnopolsky}. Therefore,
TBG has two separate chiral limits - one of them is important to understand the
formation of flat bands and the other for the Hofstadter butterfly. Taking this
as motivation we discuss how the role of AA-type hoppings in combination with
lattice relaxation effects can make individual Landau levels slightly harder to
resolve in an experimental setting than one would expect from a non-relaxed
lattice setting. Finally, we consider the impact of different forms of light on
the fractal structure of the butterfly. Particularly, we study the impact of
circularly polarized light and longitudinal light originating from a waveguide.
As the system is exposed to circularly polarized light we find butterflies with
increasingly pronounced asymmetry with respect to energy $E=0$. This is due to
the introduction of a gap term that breaks the chiral symmetries for both of
the two chiral limits mentioned above. Lastly, we study the effect of
longitudinal light that can be produced at the exit of a waveguide, in a

realized as translations of the affine Weyl group, where the overall rank in

addition to the original duality cascades, we can generalize to the cases with

assumption, the original three-level system can be reduced to a couple of
equations involving the initial and target states only. We find the control
fields which maximize the population transfer to the target state for a given
duration $T$, without using any penalty involving the population of the lossy
intermediate state, but under the constraint that the sum of the intensities of
the pump and Stokes pulses is constant, so the total field has constant
amplitude and the only control parameter is the mixing angle of the two fields.
In the optimal solution the mixing angle changes in the bang-singular-bang
manner, where the initial and final bangs correspond to equal instantaneous
rotations, while the intermediate singular arc to a linear change with time. We
show that the optimal angle of the initial and final rotations is the unique
solution of a transcendental equation where duration $T$ appears as a
parameter, while the optimal slope of the intermediate linear change as well as
the optimal transfer efficiency are expressed as functions of this optimal
angle. The corresponding optimal solution recovers the counterintuitive
pulse-sequence, with nonzero pump and Stokes fields at the boundaries. We also
show with numerical simulations that, transfer efficiency values close to the
optimal derived using the approximate system, can also be obtained with the

we define a notion of spectral network which is an object in a Fukaya category
of the surface with coefficients in a triangulated DG-category. These spectral
networks are analogs of special Lagrangian submanifolds, combining a graph with
additional algebraic data, and conjecturally correspond to semistable objects
of a suitable stability condition on the Fukaya category with coefficients.
They are closely related to the spectral networks of Gaiotto--Moore--Neitzke.
One novelty of our approach is that we establish a general uniqueness results
for spectral network representatives. We also verify the conjecture in the case
when the surface is disk with six marked points on the boundary and the
coefficients category is the derived category of representations of an $A_2$
quiver. This example is related, via homological mirror symmetry, to the stacky
quotient of an elliptic curve by the cyclic group of order six.

becoming increasingly popular as animal models are an essential part of
scientific studies and more ultra-high-field scanners are becoming available.
Some disadvantages of MRI are the availability of MRI scanners and the time
required for a full scanning session (it usually takes over 30 minutes).
Privacy laws and the 3Rs ethics rule also make it difficult to create large
datasets for training deep learning models. Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) can perform data augmentation with higher quality than other techniques.
In this work, the alpha-GAN architecture is used to test its ability to produce
realistic 3D MRI scans of the rat brain. As far as the authors are aware, this
is the first time that a GAN-based approach has been used for data augmentation
in preclinical data. The generated scans are evaluated using various
qualitative and quantitative metrics. A Turing test conducted by 4 experts has
shown that the generated scans can trick almost any expert. The generated scans
were also used to evaluate their impact on the performance of an existing deep
learning model developed for segmenting the rat brain into white matter, grey
matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The models were compared using the Dice score.
The best results for whole brain and white matter segmentation were obtained
when 174 real scans and 348 synthetic scans were used, with improvements of
0.0172 and 0.0129, respectively. Using 174 real scans and 87 synthetic scans
resulted in improvements of 0.0038 and 0.0764 for grey matter and CSF
segmentation, respectively. Thus, by using the proposed new normalisation layer
and loss functions, it was possible to improve the realism of the generated rat
MRI scans and it was shown that using the generated data improved the
segmentation model more than using the conventional data augmentation.

decompositions of the total risk difference into mediation effects. We derive
sharp and valid bounds for a number of mediation effects in the setting of two
sequential mediators both with unmeasured confounding with the outcome. We
provide five such bounds in the main text corresponding to two different
decompositions of the total effect, as well as the controlled direct effect,
with an additional thirty novel bounds provided in the supplementary materials

that, although it may seem that one can produce sharp bounds by adding or
subtracting the limits of the sharp bounds for terms in a decomposition, this
almost always produces valid, but not sharp bounds that can even be completely
noninformative. We investigate the properties of the bounds by simulating
random probability distributions under our causal model and illustrate how they

simple non-local model with long-range interactions in the form of a fractional
Laplacian is investigated in both static and a quantum quench scenario.
Logarithmic negativity, which is a measure for entanglement in mixed states is
calculated numerically. In the static case, it is shown that the presence of
long-range interaction ensures that logarithmic negativity decays much slower
with distance compared to short-range models. For a sudden quantum quench, the
temporal evolution of the logarithmic negativity reveals that, in contrast to
short-range models, logarithmic negativity exhibits no revivals for long-range
interactions for the time intervals considered. To further support this result,
a simpler measure of entanglement, namely the entanglement entropy is also
studied for this class of models.

high-dimensional functional time series, where the number of functional
variables ($p$) diverges as the number of serially dependent observations ($n$)
increases. In this paper, we present a novel functional factor model for
high-dimensional functional time series that maintains and makes use of the
functional and dynamic structure to achieve great dimension reduction and find
the latent factor structure. To estimate the number of functional factors and
the factor loadings, we propose a fully functional estimation procedure based
on an eigenanalysis for a nonnegative definite matrix. Our proposal involves a
weight matrix to improve the estimation efficiency and tackle the issue of
heterogeneity, the rationality of which is illustrated by formulating the
estimation from a novel regression perspective. Asymptotic properties of the
proposed method are studied when $p$ diverges at some polynomial rate as $n$
increases. To provide a parsimonious model and enhance interpretability for
near-zero factor loadings, we impose sparsity assumptions on the factor loading
space and then develop a regularized estimation procedure with theoretical
guarantees when $p$ grows exponentially fast relative to $n.$ Finally, we
demonstrate that our proposed estimators significantly outperform the competing
methods through both simulations and applications to a U.K. temperature dataset
and a Japanese mortality dataset.

sunshade concept, which is between $10^2$ to $10^3$ times lighter than the
lightest existing sunshade concepts. This is achieved via a net zero-radiation
pressure design, based on the use of diffractive metamaterials, removing one of
the major constraints to reducing sunshade mass. The whole sunshade system has
a total mass of approximately $6.2 \times 10^5$ tons and its deployment

achieved cost reduction might render space-based geoengineering competitive to
terrestrial geoengineering approaches.

principal bundles when the topological structure group is truncated. The
conceptually transparent proof invokes a smooth Oka principle, which becomes
available after faithfully embedding traditional equivariant topology into the
singular-cohesive homotopy theory of globally equivariant higher smooth stacks.
This works for discrete equivariance groups acting properly on smooth manifolds
with resolvable singularities, whence we are equivalently describing principal
bundles on good orbifolds.
  In preparation, we re-develop the theory of equivariant principal bundles
from scratch by systematic use of Grothendieck's internalization method. In
particular we prove that all equivariant local triviality conditions considered
in the literature are implied by regarding G-equivariant principal bundles as
principal bundles internal to the BG-slice of the ambient cohesive
infinity-topos. Generally we find that the characteristic subtle phenomena of
equivariant classifying theory all reflect basic ""modal"" properties of
singular-cohesive homotopy theory.
  Classical literature has mostly been concerned with compact Lie structure
groups. Where these are truncated, our classification recovers and generalizes
results of Lashof, May, Segal and Rezk. A key non-classical example is the
infinite projective unitary structure group, in which case we are classifying
degree-3 twists of equivariant KU-theory, recovering results of Atiyah, Segal,
Lueck and Uribe. Our theorem enhances this to conjugation-equivariance, where
we are classifying the geometric twists of equivariant KR-theory, restricting
on ""O-planes"" to the geometric twists of KO-theory. This is the generality in
which equivariant K-theory twists model quantum symmetries of topological
phases and the B-field in string theory on orbi-orientifolds.

suitable exponential martingale change of measure (Esscher transform), the
environment either drifts to $-\infty$ or oscillates. We extend recent results

steered from one state to another using specified rules. As a result, there is
belief in achieving a given condition by explicit advances. The level of
dynamism in the topology and the level of determinism in the environment are
two fundamental criteria that determine multi-agent system controllability. The
topology of a powerful multi-agent system changes on a regular basis, altering
the connections between agents and hence their cooperative effort. This survey
focuses on the controllability of MAS in a switching network with a leader that
follows the closest neighbour collaboration rule. The leader/pioneer is a
single agent that functions as an output to control other agents/members.
Because the results of activities are unknown under non-deterministic
situations, agents must choose new activities after observing the aftereffects
of their prior actions, which causes time delay and limits agent proactivity.
Controllability is often achieved in a concentrated manner in the literature,
where a certain leader educates supporters how to achieve a specific goal.
Controllability has different applications which incorporates managing
airplane, vehicle, and robots.

the basic picture intact. However, recent high-resolution images of the
archetypal type-2 galaxy NGC 1068 suggested a more radical revision. They
displayed a ring-like emission feature which the authors advocated to be hot
dust surrounding the black hole at the radius where the radiation from the
central engine evaporates the dust. That ring is too thin and too far tilted
from edge-on to hide the central engine, and ad hoc foreground extinction is
needed to explain the type-2 classification. These images quickly generated
reinterpretations of the type 1-2 dichotomy. Here we present new multi-band
mid-infrared images of NGC1068 that detail the dust temperature distribution
and reaffirm the original model. Combined with radio data, our maps locate the
central engine below the previously reported ring and obscured by a thick,
nearly edge-on disk, as predicted by the Unified Model. We also identify
emission from polar flows and absorbing dust that is mineralogically distinct
from that towards the Milky Way centre.

availability of large-scale training sets, the performance of video saliency
detection models has been improving steadily and significantly. However, deep
learning-based visualaudio fixation prediction is still in its infancy. At
present, only a few visual-audio sequences have been furnished, with real
fixations being recorded in real visual-audio environments. Hence, it would be
neither efficient nor necessary to recollect real fixations under the same
visual-audio circumstances. To address this problem, this paper promotes a
novel approach in a weakly supervised manner to alleviate the demand of
large-scale training sets for visual-audio model training. By using only the
video category tags, we propose the selective class activation mapping (SCAM)
and its upgrade (SCAM+). In the spatial-temporal-audio circumstance, the former
follows a coarse-to-fine strategy to select the most discriminative regions,
and these regions are usually capable of exhibiting high consistency with the
real human-eye fixations. The latter equips the SCAM with an additional
multi-granularity perception mechanism, making the whole process more
consistent with that of the real human visual system. Moreover, we distill
knowledge from these regions to obtain complete new spatial-temporal-audio
(STA) fixation prediction (FP) networks, enabling broad applications in cases
where video tags are not available. Without resorting to any real human-eye
fixation, the performances of these STA FP networks are comparable to those of
fully supervised networks. The code and results are publicly available at

the effectiveness of agricultural practices, researchers often turn to
randomized field experiments, which are reliable for identifying causal effects
but are often limited in scope and therefore lack external validity. Recently,
researchers have also leveraged large observational datasets from satellites
and other sources, which can lead to conclusions biased by confounding
variables or systematic measurement errors. Because experimental and
observational datasets have complementary strengths, in this paper we propose a
method that uses a combination of experimental and observational data in the
same analysis. As a case study, we focus on the causal effect of crop rotation
on corn (maize) and soy yields in the Midwestern United States. We find that,
in terms of root mean squared error, our hybrid method performs 13% better than
using experimental data alone and 26% better than using the observational data
alone in the task of predicting the effect of rotation on corn yield at
held-out experimental sites. Further, the causal estimates based on our method
suggest that benefits of crop rotations on corn yield are lower in years and
locations with high temperatures whereas the benefits of crop rotations on soy
yield are higher in years and locations with high temperatures. In particular,
we estimated that the benefit of rotation on corn yields (and soy yields) was
0.84 t/ha (0.23 t/ha) on average for the top quintile of temperatures, 1.02
t/ha (0.20 t/ha) on average for the whole dataset, and 1.18 t/ha (0.15 t/ha) on

spectroscopic data that are in the Stripe 82 region of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. In this study, tidal features around ETGs, which are detected in deep
coadded images, are used as direct evidence for mergers that occurred recently.
In the case of ETGs that do not have dust lanes, $\lambda_{R_e}$ is lower in
ETGs with tidal features than in those without tidal features (median
$\lambda_{R_e}$: $0.21$ versus $0.39$) in all stellar mass and S\'ersic index
ranges except the most massive bin, so that the fraction of ETGs with tidal
features in slow rotators is more than twice as large as that in fast rotators
($42\%$ versus $18\%$). Moreover, ETGs with tidal features have larger
$\psi_\mathrm{mis}$ than those without tidal features (mean
$\psi_\mathrm{mis}$: $28^\circ$ versus $15^\circ$). By contrast, ETGs with dust
lanes are fast rotators, and ETGs with both dust lanes and tidal features have
the highest $\lambda_{R_e}$ (median $\lambda_{R_e}$: $0.59$) among all ETG
categories. In addition, ETGs with dust lanes have small $\psi_\mathrm{mis}$

radicals. While sensitives may shift their left or right voting, inflexibles
and radicals do not. Excluding political interactions with radicals, the model
has one interaction parameter, and we found the values which reproduce all the
voting outcomes of past presidential elections from 1989 till 2018. As an
alternative approach to explain 2018 election, we found that adding an empty
third voting group overlapping left and right, the populist voting group, can
also yield Bolsonaro 2018 victory. The initial filling of the populist group is
triggered by the breaking of the interaction barrier between sensitives and
radicals, which had prevailed for decades. Within each voting group, some of
the interacting pairs sensitive/radical recast the sensitive into a populist.
This status change from sensitive to populist allows the populist to interact
with sensitives of both left and right, thus creating an additional source of
filling of the populist group. The process is shown to yield the 2018 $55\%$

This rule was recently discovered for the special case of $^{87}$Rb with its
nearly equal singlet and triplet scattering lengths. Here, we test the
propensity rule for $^{85}$Rb for which the scattering properties are very
different from $^{87}$Rb. The Rb$_2$ molecular product distribution is mapped
out in a state-to-state fashion using REMPI detection schemes which fully cover
all possible molecular spin states. Interestingly, for the experimentally
investigated range of binding energies from zero to $\sim13\:\textrm{GHz}\times

$^{85}$Rb. From these observations and a theoretical analysis we derive an
understanding for the conservation of the hyperfine spin state. We identify
several criteria to judge whether the propensity rule will also hold for other
elements and collision channels.

estimators are highly-unbalanced with varied estimation errors across frames.
Most frames in a video are relatively easy to estimate and only suffer from
slight jitters. In contrast, for rarely seen or occluded actions, the estimated
positions of multiple joints largely deviate from the ground truth values for a
consecutive sequence of frames, rendering significant jitters on them. To
tackle this problem, we propose to attach a dedicated temporal-only refinement
network to existing pose estimators for jitter mitigation, named SmoothNet.
Unlike existing learning-based solutions that employ spatio-temporal models to
co-optimize per-frame precision and temporal smoothness at all the joints,
SmoothNet models the natural smoothness characteristics in body movements by
learning the long-range temporal relations of every joint without considering
the noisy correlations among joints. With a simple yet effective motion-aware
fully-connected network, SmoothNet improves the temporal smoothness of existing
pose estimators significantly and enhances the estimation accuracy of those
challenging frames as a side-effect. Moreover, as a temporal-only model, a
unique advantage of SmoothNet is its strong transferability across various
types of estimators and datasets. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets
with eleven popular backbone networks across 2D and 3D pose estimation and body
recovery tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution. Code is
available at https://github.com/cure-lab/SmoothNet.

that is not allowed to become negative, but does not have zero tests. Their
simplicity and close connection to various other models (e.g., VASS, Counter

border of decidability for the classical decision problems.
  The deterministic fragment of OCNs (DOCNs) typically admits more tractable
decision problems, and while these problems and the expressive power of DOCNs
have been studied, the determinization problem, namely deciding whether an OCN
admits an equivalent DOCN, has not received attention.
  We introduce four notions of OCN determinizability, which arise naturally due
to intricacies in the model, and specifically, the interpretation of the
initial counter value. We show that in general, determinizability is
undecidable under most notions, but over a singleton alphabet (i.e., 1

conservation of the eigenvalues of the matrix state variable, should therefore
be retained when discretizing these systems. Recently, it was shown how
isospectral Runge-Kutta methods can, in the Lie-Poisson case also considered in
our work, be obtained through Hamiltonian reduction of symplectic Runge-Kutta
methods on the cotangent bundle of a Lie group. We provide the Lagrangian

derive the methods through a discrete Euler-Poincare reduction. Our derivation
relies on a formulation of diagonally implicit isospectral Runge-Kutta methods

source intensity cannot be controlled exactly. Our method can be combined with
the two-way classical communication method such as active odd-parity pairing to
further improve the key rate. The numerical results show that if the intensity
error is within a few percent, the key rate and secure distance only decrease
marginally. The key rate of the recent SNS experiment in the 511 km field fiber
is still positive using our method presented here, even if there is $\pm 9.5\%$

reflection, and shifting) such that these point clouds are well aligned? This
problem, known as the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem (GOPP), has
found numerous applications in statistics, computer vision, and imaging
science. While one commonly-used method is finding the least squares estimator,
it is generally an NP-hard problem to obtain the least squares estimator
exactly due to the notorious nonconvexity. In this work, we apply the
semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and the generalized power method to
solve this generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem. In particular, we assume
the data are generated from a signal-plus-noise model: each observed point
cloud is a noisy copy of the same unknown point cloud transformed by an unknown
orthogonal matrix and also corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. We show that
the generalized power method (equivalently alternating minimization algorithm)
with spectral initialization converges to the unique global optimum to the SDP
relaxation, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is high. Moreover, this
limiting point is exactly the least squares estimator and also the maximum
likelihood estimator. In addition, we derive a block-wise estimation error for
each orthogonal matrix and the underlying point cloud. Our theoretical bound is
near-optimal in terms of the information-theoretic limit (only loose by a
factor of the dimension and a log factor). Our results significantly improve
the state-of-the-art results on the tightness of the SDP relaxation for the
generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem, an open problem posed by Bandeira,

the clump harbours four dust cores (C1-C4) with masses below 3 M$_{\odot}$.
Cores C3 and C4 exhibit well collimated, young, and low-mass molecular
outflows. C1 and C2 present CH$_3$CN J=13--12 emission, from which we derive

PageRank. We show that, for several centrality measures that root trees, the

assess the quality of trees. We use these functions to give fundamental
insights on rooting and derive a characterization explaining why some measure
root trees. Moreover, we provide an almost liner-time algorithm to compute the

Batch-BALanCe relies on a novel decision-theoretic acquisition function that

the size of the equivalence classes as learning progresses. To scale up the
computation of queries to large batches, we further propose an efficient
batch-mode acquisition procedure, which aims to maximize a novel information

classes are sufficiently present within the training set. Due to their inherent
rarities, extreme events are always under-represented and classifiers tailored
for predicting extremes need to be carefully designed to handle this
under-representation. In this paper, we address the question of how to assess
and compare classifiers with respect to their capacity to capture extreme
occurrences. This is also related to the topic of scoring rules used in
forecasting literature. In this context, we propose and study a risk function
adapted to extremal classifiers. The inferential properties of our empirical
risk estimator are derived under the framework of multivariate regular
variation and hidden regular variation. A simulation study compares different
classifiers and indicates their performance with respect to our risk function.
To conclude, we apply our framework to the analysis of extreme river discharges
in the Danube river basin. The application compares different predictive
algorithms and test their capacity at forecasting river discharges from other
river stations. As a byproduct, we study the special class of linear
classifiers, show that the optimisation of our risk function leads to a
consistent solution and we identify the explanatory variables that contribute
the most to extremal behavior.

behavior trees (BTs) that use reinforcement learning (RL). BTs represent a
hierarchical and modular way of combining control policies into higher level
control policies. Backward chaining is a design principle for the construction
of BTs that combine reactivity with goal directed actions in a structured way.
The backward chained structure has also enabled convergence proofs for BTs,
identifying a set of local conditions that lead to the convergence of all
trajectories to a set of desired goal states. The key idea of this letter is to
improve performance of backward chained BTs by using the conditions identified
in a theoretical convergence proof to setup the RL problems for individual
controllers. In particular, previous analysis identified so-called active
constraint conditions (ACCs), that should not be broken in order to avoid
having to return to work on previously achieved subgoals. We propose a way to
setup the RL problems, such that they do not only achieve each immediate
subgoal, but also avoid violating the identified ACCs. The resulting
performance improvement depends on how often ACC violations occurred before the
change, and how much effort was needed to re-achieve them. The proposed
approach is illustrated in a dynamic simulation environment.

customers and boost sales, leading to frequent changes of occasions, which
drives users to behave differently. In such situations, most existing
Click-Through Rate (CTR) models can't generalize well to online serving due to
distribution uncertainty of the upcoming occasion. In this paper, we propose a
novel CTR model named MOEF for recommendations under frequent changes of
occasions. Firstly, we design a time series that consists of occasion signals
generated from the online business scenario. Since occasion signals are more
discriminative in the frequency domain, we apply Fourier Transformation to
sliding time windows upon the time series, obtaining a sequence of frequency
spectrum which is then processed by Occasion Evolution Layer (OEL). In this
way, a high-order occasion representation can be learned to handle the online
distribution uncertainty. Moreover, we adopt multiple experts to learn feature
representations from multiple aspects, which are guided by the occasion
representation via an attention mechanism. Accordingly, a mixture of feature
representations is obtained adaptively for different occasions to predict the
final CTR. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the superiority
of MOEF and online A/B tests also show MOEF outperforms representative CTR
models significantly.

anisotropy in solar wind turbulence. The energy cascade rate between scales in
the inertial range depends strongly on the direction of this magnetic guide
field, splitting the energy cascade according to the parallel and perpendicular
directions with respect to magnetic guide field. Aims. Using more than two
years of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations, the isotropy and anisotropy
energy cascade rates are investigated. The variance and normalized fluctuation
ratios, the kinetic and magnetic energies, and the normalized cross-helicity
and residual energy are studied. The connection between the heliocentric
distance, the local temperature of the plasma, and the energy cascade
components is made. Methods. Using exact relations for fully developed
incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the incompressible energy
cascade rate is computed. In particular, using the isotropy and 2D and slab
assumptions, the isotropic, perpendicular, and parallel energy cascade rate
components are estimated. Results. The variance anisotropy ratios, for both
velocity and magnetic fields, do not exhibit a dependence with respect to the
heliocentric distance $r$ between 0.2 and 0.8 au. While the velocity normalized
fluctuation ratio shows a dependence with $r$, the magnetic normalized
fluctuation ratio does not. A strong correlation between the isotropic and
anisotropic energy cascade rates and the temperature is found. A clear
dominance of the perpendicular cascades over the parallel cascades as PSP
approaches the Sun is observed. A dominant 2D cascade and/or geometry over the
slab component in slow solar wind turbulence in the largest MHD scales is
observed.

investigates whether these effects are passed down to future generations. We
exploit the temporal and spatial variation of electoral violence in Kenya
between 1992 and 2013 in conjunction with a nationally representative survey to
identify people exposed to such violence. Using coarsened matching, we find
that exposure to electoral violence between prenatal and the age of sixteen
reduces adult height. Previous research has demonstrated that protracted,
large-scale armed conflicts can pass down stunting effects to descendants. In
line with these studies, we find that the low-scale but recurrent electoral
violence in Kenya has affected the height-for-age of children whose parents
were exposed to such violence during their growing years. Only boys exhibit
this intergenerational effect, possibly due to their increased susceptibility
to malnutrition and stunting in Sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast to previous
research on large-scale conflicts, childhood exposure to electoral violence has
no long-term effect on educational attainment or household consumption per
capita. Most electoral violence in Kenya has occurred during school breaks,
which may have mitigated its long-term effects on human capital and earning
capacity.

spectrum (f is the frequency). The generation - recombination bulges are
characteristic for diamond diodes with lower turn-on voltages. The noise
spectral density dependence on forward current, I, reveals three distinctive
regions in all examined devices - it scales as I^2 at the low (I<10 uA) and
high (I>10 mA) currents, and, rather unusually, remain nearly constant at the
intermediate current range. The characteristic trap time constants, extracted
from the noise data, reveal a uniquely strong dependence on current.
Interestingly, the performance of the diamond diodes improves with increasing

around natural philosophy. Entanglement, non-locality, collapse, many worlds,
many minds, and subjectivism have challenged generations of thinkers. Its
approach can perhaps be placed in the stream of quantum logic, in which the
""strangeness"" of quantum mechanics is ""measured"" through the violation of
Bell's inequalities and, from there, attempts an interpretative path that
preserves realism yet ends up overturning it, restating the fundamental
mechanisms of QM as a logical necessity for a strong realism.

diffusion problem on unbounded domain. This problem is well-known to be
ill-posed, whence the need of a regularization method in order to recover
stable approximate solution. For the problem under consideration, we present a
unified framework of regularization which covers some techniques such as
Fourier regularization [19], mollification [12] and approximate-inverse [7]. We
investigate a regularization technique with two major advantages: the
simplicity of computation of the regularized solution and the avoid of
truncation of high frequency components (so as to avoid undesirable oscillation
on the resulting approximate-solution). Under classical Sobolev-smoothness
conditions, we derive order-optimal error estimates between the approximate
solution and the exact solution in the case where both the data and the model
are only approximately known. In addition, an order-optimal a-posteriori
parameter choice rule based on the Morozov principle is given. Finally, via
some numerical experiments in two-dimensional space, we illustrate the
efficiency of our regularization approach and we numerically confirm the
theoretical convergence rates established in the paper.

(ASD) by using network-based functional connectivity. It has been shown that
ASD is associated with brain regions and their inter-connections. However,
discriminating based on connectivity patterns among imaging data of the control
population and that of ASD patients' brains is a non-trivial task. In order to
tackle said classification task, we propose a novel deep learning architecture
(MHATC) consisting of multi-head attention and temporal consolidation modules
for classifying an individual as a patient of ASD. The devised architecture
results from an in-depth analysis of the limitations of current deep neural
network solutions for similar applications. Our approach is not only robust but
computationally efficient, which can allow its adoption in a variety of other

signals to 2-dimensional images using the interpolation method and identified
classification using capsule network(CapsNet) and achieved 89.34%

associated with major magnetic storms due to intense Earth-directed Coronal
Mass Ejections. Since these energetic events represent one of the most
important components of space weather their study is of paramount importance to
understand the Sun-Earth connection. Due to the rarity of these events, being
able to access all available information for the few cases studied is equally
important. Especially if we refer to historical periods in which current
accurate observations from ground-based instruments or from space were not
available. Certainly, among these events we must include the great aurora of
February 4, 1872. An event whose effects have been observed in different
regions of the Earth. What we could consider today a global event, especially
for its effects on the communication systems of the time, such as the
transatlantic cable that allowed a connection between the United States and
Europe since 1866. In this paper we describe the main results of the
observations and studies carried out by Angelo Secchi at the Observatory of the
Roman College and described in his ""Memoria sull'Aurora Elettrica del 4
Febbraio 1872"" for the Notes of the Pontifical Academy of new Lincei. This note
is extremely modern both in its multi-instrumental approach to the study of
these phenomena and in its association between solar-terrestrial connection and
technological infrastructures on the Earth. The Secchi's note definitely
represents the first example of analysis and study of an event on a global
scale, such as the Atlantic cable, affecting the Earth. What we nowadays call
an extreme space weather event.

responsive colloidal particles. In the case of 2D microplatelets, rotating
magnetic fields are typically used to orient them parallel to each other in a
brick-and-mortar fashion. Thanks to this microstructure, the resulting
composites achieve enhanced mechanical and functional properties. However,
parts with complex geometry require their microstructure to be specifically
tuned and controlled locally in 3D. Although the tunability of the
microstructure along the vertical direction has already been demonstrated using
magnetic orientation combined with sequential or continuous casting,
controlling the particle orientation in the horizontal plane in a fast and
effective fashion remains challenging. Here, we propose to use rotating
magnetic arrays to control the in-plane orientation of ferromagnetic Nickel
flakes distributed in uncured polymeric matrices. We experimentally studied the
orientation of the flakes in response to magnets rotating at various
frequencies and precessing angles. Then, we used COMSOL to model the magnetic
field from rotating magnetic arrays and predicted the resulting in-plane
orientations. To validate the approach, we created composites with locally
oriented flakes. This work could initiate reverse-engineering methods to design
the microstructure in composite materials with intricate geometrical shapes for
structural or functional applications.

existential risk studies (ERS) necessitate serious scrutiny and
self-reflection. We argue that existing approaches to studying existential risk
are not yet fit for purpose, and perhaps even run the risk of increasing harm.
We highlight general challenges in ERS: accommodating value pluralism, crafting
precise definitions, developing comprehensive tools for risk assessment,
dealing with uncertainty, and accounting for the dangers associated with taking
exceptional actions to mitigate or prevent catastrophes. The most influential
framework for ERS, the 'techno-utopian approach' (TUA), struggles with these
issues and has a unique set of additional problems: it unnecessarily combines
the study of longtermism and longtermist ethics with the study of extinction,
relies on a non-representative moral worldview, uses ambiguous and inadequate
definitions, fails to incorporate insights from risk assessment in relevant
fields, chooses arbitrary categorisations of risk, and advocates for dangerous
mitigation strategies. Its moral and empirical assumptions might be
particularly vulnerable to securitisation and misuse. We suggest several key
improvements: separating the study of extinction ethics (ethical implications
of extinction) and existential ethics (the ethical implications of different
societal forms), from the analysis of human extinction and global catastrophe;
drawing on the latest developments in risk assessment literature; diversifying
the field, and; democratising its policy recommendations.
