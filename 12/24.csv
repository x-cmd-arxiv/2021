International Space Station since August 2019. Since the first data acquisition
in October 2019, more than 35 sessions have been performed for a total of 52
hours of observations. The detector has been observing Earth at night-time in
the UV range and detected a wide variety of transient sources all of which have
been modelled through Monte Carlo simulations. Mini-EUSO is also capable of
detecting meteors and potentially space debris and we performed simulations for
such events to estimate their impact on future missions for cosmic ray science
from space. We show here examples of the simulation work done in this framework
to analyse the Mini-EUSO data. The expected response of Mini-EUSO with respect
to ultra high energy cosmic ray showers has been studied. The efficiency curve
of Mini-EUSO as a function of primary energy has been estimated and the energy
threshold for Cosmic Rays has been placed to be above 10^{21} eV. We compared
the morphology of several transient events detected during the mission with
cosmic ray simulations and excluded that they can be due to cosmic ray showers.
To validate the energy threshold of the detector, a system of ground based
flashers is being used for end-to-end calibration purposes. We therefore
implemented a parameterisation of such flashers into the JEM-EUSO simulation
framework and studied the response of the detector with respect to such
sources.

provided a new avenue in histology examination. The innovations have been
largely focused on cancer pathology (i.e., tumor segmentation and
characterization). In non-cancer pathology, the learning algorithms can be
asked to examine more comprehensive tissue types simultaneously, as a
multi-label setting. The prior arts typically needed to train multiple
segmentation networks in order to match the domain-specific knowledge for
heterogeneous tissue types (e.g., glomerular tuft, glomerular unit, proximal
tubular, distal tubular, peritubular capillaries, and arteries). In this paper,
we propose a dynamic single segmentation network (Omni-Seg) that learns to
segment multiple tissue types using partially labeled images (i.e., only one
tissue type is labeled for each training image) for renal pathology. By
learning from ~150,000 patch-wise pathological images from six tissue types,
the proposed Omni-Seg network achieved superior segmentation accuracy and less
resource consumption when compared to the previous the multiple-network and
multi-head design. In the testing stage, the proposed method obtains
""completely labeled"" tissue segmentation results using only ""partially labeled""
training images. The source code is available at

noteworthy way to increase cache memories robustness against soft errors. EDC
enables detecting errors in cache memory while ECC is used to correct erroneous
cache blocks. ECCs are often costly as they impose considerable area and energy
overhead on cache memory. Reducing this overhead has been the subject of many
studies. In particular, a previous study has suggested mapping ECC to the main
memory at the expense of high cache traffic and energy. A major source of this
excessive traffic and energy is the high frequency of cache writes. In this
work, we show that a significant portion of cache writes are silent, i.e., they
write the same data already existing. We build on this observation and
introduce Traffic-aware ECC (or simply TCC). TCC detects silent writes by an
efficient mechanism. Once such writes are detected updating their ECC is
avoided effectively reducing L2 cache traffic and access frequency. Using our
solution, we reduce L2 cache access frequency by 8% while maintaining
performance. We reduce L2 cache dynamic and overall cache energy by up to 32%
and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, TCC reduces L2 cache miss rate by 3%.

a generative model based on an interplay between community and hierarchical
structures. It assumes that each node has a preference in the interaction
mechanism and nodes with the same preference are more likely to interact, while
heterogeneous interactions are still allowed. The sparsity of the network is
exploited for implementing a more efficient algorithm. We demonstrate our
method on synthetic and real-world data and compare performance with two
standard approaches for community detection and ranking extraction. We find
that the algorithm accurately retrieves the overall node's preference in
different scenarios, and we show that it can distinguish small subsets of nodes
that behave differently than the majority. As a consequence, the model can
recognize whether a network has an overall preferred interaction mechanism.
This is relevant in situations where there is no clear ""a priori"" information

inflation at the curvaton decay, which may have a prominent non-Gaussian
effect. For a model with a non-trivial kinetic term, an enhanced curvature
perturbation on a small scale can be realized, which can lead to copious
production of primordial black holes (PBHs) and induce secondary gravitational
waves (GWs). Using the probability distribution function which takes full
nonlinear effects into account, we calculate the PBH formation. We find that
under the assumption that thus formed PBHs would not overclose the universe,
the non-Gaussianity of the curvature perturbation can be well approximated by
the local quadratic form, which can be used to calculate the induced GWs. In
this model the limit of large non-Gaussianity can be reached when the curvaton
energy fraction $r$ is small at the moment of curvaton decay. We also show that
the $r\to1$ limit of non-Gaussianity coincides with that of ultra-slow-roll

combining DRAM with PM bring the potential to provide a tiered,
byte-addressable main memory of unprecedented capacity. Nearly a decade after
the first proposals for these hybrid architectures, the real technology has
finally reached commercial availability with Intel Optane(TM) DC Persistent
Memory (DCPMM). This raises the challenge of designing systems that realize
this potential in practice, namely through effective approaches that
dynamically decide at which memory tier should pages be placed. In this paper,
we are the first, to our knowledge, to systematically analyze tiered page

assumptions of state-of-the-art proposals, and confronting them with the
idiosyncrasies of today's off-the-shelf DCPMM-equipped architectures. This
empirical study reveals that some of the key design choices in the literature
rely on important assumptions that are not verified in present-day DRAM-DCPMM

implement HyPlacer, a tool for tiered page placement in off-the-shelf
Linux-based systems equipped with DRAM+DCPMM. In contrast to previous
proposals, HyPlacer follows an approach guided by two main practicality
principles: 1) it is tailored to the performance idiosyncrasies of off-theshelf
DRAM+DCPMM systems; and 2) it can be seamlessly integrated into Linux with
minimal kernel-mode components, while ensuring extensibility to other HMAs and
other data placement policies. Our experimental evaluation of HyPlacer shows
that it outperforms both solutions proposed in past literature and placement
options that are currently available in off-the-shelf DCPMM-equipped Linux

performed in a mean-field limit where the neutrinos time evolve in a product

  In this paper we examine a simple two-beam model evolving from an initial

symmetries in this model allow us to solve the real-time evolution for the
quantum many-body system for hundreds or thousands of spins, far beyond what
would be possible in a more general case with an exponential number ($2^N$) of

initial product states and ratios of one- and two-body couplings, and find that
in all cases in the limit of infinite spins the mean-field (product state) and
many-body solutions coincide for simple observables. This agreement can be
understood as a consequence of the fact that the typical initial condition
represents a very local but dense distribution about a mean energy in the
spectrum of the Hamiltonian. We explore quantum information measures like
entanglement entropy and purity of the many-body solutions, finding intriguing
relationships between the quantum information measures and the dynamical

  version",,,,"cs.PL cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Rust is a modern systems language focused on performance and reliability.
Complementing Rust's promise to provide ""fearless concurrency"", developers
frequently exploit asynchronous message passing. Unfortunately, arbitrarily
ordering sending and receiving messages to maximise computation-communication
overlap (a popular optimisation to message-passing applications) opens up a
Pandora's box of further subtle concurrency bugs.
  To guarantee deadlock-freedom by construction, we present Rumpsteak: a new
Rust framework based on multiparty session types. Previous session type
implementations in Rust are either built upon synchronous and blocking
communication and/or limited to two-party interactions. Crucially, none support
the arbitrary ordering of messages for efficiency.
  Rumpsteak instead targets asynchronous async/await code. Its unique ability
is allowing developers to arbitrarily order send/receive messages while
preserving deadlock-freedom. For this, Rumpsteak incorporates two recent
advanced session type theories: (1) k-multiparty compatibility (kmc), which
globally verifies the safety of a set of participants, and (2) asynchronous
multiparty session subtyping, which locally verifies optimisations in the
context of a single participant. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm for
asynchronous subtyping that is both sound and decidable.
  We first evaluate the performance and expressiveness of Rumpsteak against
three previous Rust implementations. We discover that Rumpsteak is around
1.7--8.6x more efficient and can safely express many more examples by virtue of
offering arbitrary message ordering. Secondly, we analyse the complexity of our
new algorithm and benchmark it against kmc and a binary session subtyping
algorithm. We find they are exponentially slower than Rumpsteak's.

possibly anisotropic spherical random fields, within a functional data analysis
context. We consider a measurement framework where each random field among an
identically distributed collection of spherical random fields is sampled at a
few random directions, possibly subject to measurement error. The collection of
random fields could be i.i.d. or serially dependent. Though similar setups have
already been explored for random functions defined on the unit interval, the
nonparametric estimators proposed in the literature often rely on local
polynomials, which do not readily extend to the (product) spherical setting. We
therefore formulate our estimation procedure as a variational problem involving
a generalized Tikhonov regularization term. The latter favours smooth
covariance/autocovariance functions, where the smoothness is specified by means
of suitable Sobolev-like pseudo-differential operators. Using the machinery of
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we establish representer theorems that fully
characterize the form of our estimators. We determine their uniform rates of
convergence as the number of random fields diverges, both for the dense
(increasing number of spatial samples) and sparse (bounded number of spatial
samples) regimes. We moreover demonstrate the computational feasibility and
practical merits of our estimation procedure in a simulation setting, assuming
a fixed number of samples per random field. Our numerical estimation procedure
leverages the sparsity and second-order Kronecker structure of our setup to
reduce the computational and memory requirements by approximately three orders
of magnitude compared to a naive implementation would require.

inclined passage of a shaped electron wave packet with an electric quadrupole
moment in the non-paraxial regime. Spreading of an asymmetric wave packet
induces quadrupole corrections to the radiation field. Although the
non-paraxial corrections stay small, they are dynamically enhanced during the
interaction of the electron with the grating whose length exceeds the Rayleigh
length of the packet.
  To simplify the possible experimental setup where such effects could be
measured, we study the dependence of these effects on the inclination angle,
i.e. the angle between the mean velocity of the packet and the surface of the
grating. There is a minimal angle such that the multipole expansion always
stays valid at the grating surface. In such a regime, the quadrupole
contribution to the Smith-Purcell radiation can become the leading one, which
represents a novel quantum effect impossible for classical point-like
electrons.
  Thus, the impact of the wave-packet shape (vortex structure or non-spherical

the regime of low drift velocity, the linear stage of the instability in PIC
simulations differs significantly from the theoretical predictions, whereas in
the Vlasov simulations it does not. A series of highly resolved PIC simulations
with increasingly large numbers of macroparticles per cell is performed using a
number of different PIC codes.
  All the simulations predict highly similar growth rates that are several
times larger than those calculated from the linear theory. As a result, we find
that the true convergence of the PIC simulations in the linear regime is
elusive to achieve in practice and can easily be misidentified.
  The discrepancy between the theoretical and observed growth rates is
attributed to the initial noise inherently present in PIC simulations, but not
in Vlasov simulations, that causes particle trapping even though the fraction
of trapped particles is low. We show analytically that even weak distortions of
the electron velocity distribution function (such as flattening due to particle
trapping) result in significant modifications of the growth rates. It is also
found that the common quiet-start method for PIC simulations leads to more
accurate growth rates but only if the maximum growth rate mode is perturbed
initially. We demonstrate that the quiet-start method does not completely
remedy the noise problem because the simulations generally exhibit
inconsistencies with the linear theory.

this transfer potential has the effect of inducing an effective equation of

finding that the well-known large-scale instability that affects a large class

that interacting dark energy models with $w=-1$ are equivalent to a class of

lack the much-required uncertainty modelling and robustness capabilities which
are crucial for their use in several real-world applications such as autonomous
driving and healthcare. We propose a novel and unique approach to model
uncertainty in NODE by considering a distribution over the end-time $T$ of the
ODE solver. The proposed approach, latent time NODE (LT-NODE), treats $T$ as a
latent variable and apply Bayesian learning to obtain a posterior distribution
over $T$ from the data. In particular, we use variational inference to learn an
approximate posterior and the model parameters. Prediction is done by
considering the NODE representations from different samples of the posterior
and can be done efficiently using a single forward pass. As $T$ implicitly
defines the depth of a NODE, posterior distribution over $T$ would also help in
model selection in NODE. We also propose, adaptive latent time NODE (ALT-NODE),
which allow each data point to have a distinct posterior distribution over
end-times. ALT-NODE uses amortized variational inference to learn an
approximate posterior using inference networks. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches in modelling uncertainty and
robustness through experiments on synthetic and several real-world image

together with data collected from trajectories of unknown systems. We first
reformulate the barrier-based safety verification as a robust convex problem
(RCP). Solving the acquired RCP is hard in general because not only the state
of the system lives in a continuous set, but also and more problematic, the
unknown model appears in one of the constraints of RCP. Instead, we leverage a
finite number of data, and accordingly, the RCP is casted as a scenario convex
problem (SCP). We then relate the optimizer of the SCP to that of the RCP, and
consequently, we provide a safety guarantee over the unknown stochastic system
with a priori guaranteed confidence. We apply our approach to an unknown room
temperature system by collecting sampled data from trajectories of the system
and verify formally that temperature of the room lies in a comfort zone for a
finite time horizon with a desired confidence.

fitting a plane in a least squares sense to the volume fraction data of
neighboring cells while implicitly accounting for volume conservation in the

employing a Newton-type method. Moreover, applying the Reynolds transport
theorem allows to assess the regularity of the derivatives. Since the
divergence theorem implies that the volume fraction can be cast as a sum of
face-based quantities, our method considerably simplifies the numerical
procedure for applications in three spatial dimensions while demonstrating an
inherent ability to robustly deal with unstructured meshes. We discuss the
theoretical foundations, regularity and appropriate error measures, along with
the details of the numerical algorithm. Finally, numerical results for convex

biomarkers as surrogates for exposure to risk factors for non-communicable
diseases in epidemiological studies and randomized trials. DNAm variability has
been demonstrated to be tightly related to lifestyle behavior and exposure to
environmental risk factors, ultimately providing an unbiased proxy of an
individual state of health. At present, the creation of DNAm surrogates relies
on univariate penalized regression models, with elastic-net regularizer being
the gold standard when accomplishing the task. Nonetheless, more advanced
modeling procedures are required in the presence of multivariate outcomes with
a structured dependence pattern among the study samples. In this work we
propose a general framework for mixed-effects multitask learning in presence of
high-dimensional predictors to develop a multivariate DNAm biomarker from a
multi-center study. A penalized estimation scheme based on an
expectation-maximization algorithm is devised, in which any penalty criteria
for fixed-effects models can be conveniently incorporated in the fitting
process. We apply the proposed methodology to create novel DNAm surrogate
biomarkers for multiple correlated risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and
comorbidities. We show that the proposed approach, modeling multiple outcomes
together, outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, both in predictive power
and bio-molecular interpretation of the results.

near-infrared observations. The galaxy was not detected earlier due to its
superposition with the background galaxy, NGC 6902A. They were together
mistakenly classified as an interacting system. NGC 6902A is at a redshift of
0.05554, but MUSE observations indicate that the interacting tail is a separate
star-forming, foreground galaxy at a redshift of 0.00980. We refer to the new
galaxy as UVIT J202258.73-441623.8 (UVIT J2022). The near-infrared observations
show that UVIT J2022 has a stellar mass of 8.7$\times$10$^{8}$M$_{\odot}$. Its
inner disk (R$<$4 kpc) shows UV and H$\alpha$ emission from ongoing massive
star formation. The rest of the disk is extremely low luminosity, has a low
stellar surface density, and extends out to a radius of R$\sim$9 kpc. The
velocity and metallicity distribution maps and the star formation history
indicate that UVIT J2022 has undergone three bursts of star formation. The
latest episode is ongoing, which is supported by the presence of widespread
H$\alpha$ and UV emission in its inner disk. The galaxy also shows patchy
spiral arms in far-UV, and there is a metallicity enhancement along a bar-like
feature. UVIT J2022 is thus a unique example of triggered star formation in a
diffuse galaxy, resulting in the growth of its inner stellar disk. Our study
raises the intriguing possibility that (i) there could be similar diffuse
galaxies that have been mistakenly interpreted as interacting galaxies due to
their superposition, and (ii) UV or H$\alpha$ could be a way to detect such
diffuse galaxies in our local universe.

reproduce the heterogeneity in the age distributions of immunity profiles and

lack the much-required uncertainty modelling and robustness capabilities which
are crucial for their use in several real-world applications such as autonomous

uncertainty in NODE by considering a distribution over the end-time $T$ of the
ODE solver. The proposed approach, latent time NODE (LT-NODE), treats $T$ as a
latent variable and apply Bayesian learning to obtain a posterior distribution
over $T$ from the data. In particular, we use variational inference to learn an
approximate posterior and the model parameters. Prediction is done by
considering the NODE representations from different samples of the posterior
and can be done efficiently using a single forward pass. As $T$ implicitly
defines the depth of a NODE, posterior distribution over $T$ would also help in
model selection in NODE. We also propose, adaptive latent time NODE (ALT-NODE),
which allow each data point to have a distinct posterior distribution over
end-times. ALT-NODE uses amortized variational inference to learn an
approximate posterior using inference networks. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches in modelling uncertainty and
robustness through experiments on synthetic and several real-world image

short range interactions, in the C* algebra formulation of statistical
mechanics. Ergodicity results, in the context of group actions on C* algebras,
assume that the algebra is asymptotically abelian, which is not the case for
time evolution. The Lieb-Robinson bound tells us that the spatial extent of the
time evolution of operators is exponentially small outside a light-cone,
defined by the Lieb-Robinson velocity. More precisely, this means that the
algebra of observables is asymptotically abelian only in a space-like region.
This implies a form of ergodicity outside the light-cone, but what happens
within it? We show that the long-time average of connected correlation
functions of observables, along space-time rays of almost every speed,
vanishes. This holds in any state that is invariant under space-time
translations and that satisfies weak clustering properties in space. Further,
we show that the long-time limit of the n-th moment, with respect to the state,
of a ray-averaged observable converges to the n-th power of its ensemble
average, which means that there are no fluctuations of ray averages in the long
time limit. This is a statement of ergodicity. The ray averages can also be
performed in a way that accounts for oscillations, showing that correlations
(and moments) of the ray averaged observables cannot sustainably oscillate in
the long time limit. Finally, we show that in the GNS representation of the
algebra of observables, for any KMS state with the above properties, the
long-time limit of the ray averaged commutator converges (in the strong
operator topology (SOT)) to 0 and the ray average of any observable converges
(in the SOT) to a multiple of the identity. This indicates that observables get

high-energy neutron monitors using gadolinium-loaded Water Cherenkov Detectors
(WCDs). GEANT4 simulations of photon production in WCDs are used to estimate
the maximum detection efficiency for a hypothetical system. Requiring a series
of neutron induced gamma ray flashes distributed over an extended period of
time (up to 20{\mu}s) was shown to be an effective way to discriminate high
energy neutron interactions from other backgrounds. Results suggest that
neutron detection efficiencies of 4-15% may be possible using a
gadolinium-loaded detection system above 200 MeV. The magnitude of gadolinium
loading was also shown to significantly modify the timing response of the
simulated detector.

to large numbers of agents is assigning credit to individual agents' actions.
In this paper, we address this credit assignment problem with an approach that
we call \textit{partial reward decoupling} (PRD), which attempts to decompose
large cooperative multi-agent RL problems into decoupled subproblems involving
subsets of agents, thereby simplifying credit assignment. We empirically
demonstrate that decomposing the RL problem using PRD in an actor-critic
algorithm results in lower variance policy gradient estimates, which improves
data efficiency, learning stability, and asymptotic performance across a wide
array of multi-agent RL tasks, compared to various other actor-critic
approaches. Additionally, we relate our approach to counterfactual multi-agent

emulator of the KiDS-1000 survey footprint, which generates noise-free
spherical maps in a fraction of a second. It takes a set of cosmological
parameters $(\Omega_M, \sigma_8)$ as input and produces a consistent set of 5
maps, corresponding to the KiDS-1000 tomographic redshift bins. To construct
the emulator, we use a conditional generative adversarial network architecture
and the spherical CNN $\texttt{DeepSphere}$, and train it on N-body-simulated
mass maps. We compare its performance using an array of quantitative comparison
metrics: angular power spectra $C_\ell$, pixel/peaks distributions, $C_\ell$
correlation matrices, and Structural Similarity Index. Overall, the average
agreement on these summary statistics is $<10\%$ for the cosmologies at the
centre of the simulation grid, and degrades slightly on grid edges. Finally, we
perform a mock cosmological parameter estimation using the emulator and the
original simulation set. We find good agreement in these constraints, for both
likelihood and likelihood-free approaches. The emulator is available at

fundamental database theory results and techniques fail to survive when we try
to see query answers as bags (multisets) of tuples rather than as sets of

  But disappointingly, almost 30 years after [CV93], the bag-semantics based
database theory is still in its infancy. We do not even know whether
conjunctive query containment is decidable. And this is not due to lack of
interest, but because, in the multiset world, everything suddenly gets
discouragingly complicated.
  In this paper, we try to re-examine, in the bag semantics scenario, the query
determinacy problem, which has recently been intensively studied in the set
semantics scenario. We show that query determinacy (under bag semantics) is
decidable for boolean conjunctive queries and undecidable for unions of such
queries (in contrast to the set semantics scenario, where the UCQ case remains
decidable even for unary queries). We also show that -- surprisingly -- for
path queries determinacy under bag semantics coincides with determinacy under
set semantics (and thus it is decidable).

rays (CRs) and multiwavelength astronomy, thanks to the new instrumentation
launched into space and built on the ground. Modern technologies employed by
those instruments provide measurements with unmatched precision, enabling
searches for subtle signatures of dark matter (DM) and new physics.
Understanding the astrophysical backgrounds to better precision than the
observed data is vital in moving to this new territory. The state-of-the-art CR
propagation code called GALPROP is designed to address exactly this challenge.
Having 25 years of development behind it, the GALPROP framework has become a
de-facto standard in the astrophysics of CRs, diffuse photon emissions (radio-
to gamma-rays), and searches for new physics. GALPROP uses information from
astronomy, particle physics, and nuclear physics to predict CRs and their
associated emissions self-consistently, providing a unifying modelling
framework. The range of its physical validity covers 18 orders of magnitude in
energy, from sub-keV to PeV energies for particles and from micro-eV to PeV
energies for photons. The framework and the datasets are public and are
extensively used by many experimental collaborations and by thousands of
individual researchers worldwide for interpretation of their data and for
making predictions. This paper details the latest release of the GALPROP
framework and updated cross sections, further developments of its initially
auxiliary datasets for models of the interstellar medium that grew into
independent studies of the Galactic structure -- distributions of gas, dust,
radiation and magnetic fields -- as well as the extension of its modelling
capabilities. Example applications included with the distribution illustrating
usage of the new features are also described.

fundamental problem of finding a node among a set of marked nodes in a graph,
known as spatial search. Whether spatial search by continuous-time quantum walk
provides a quadratic advantage over classical random walks has been an
outstanding problem. Thus far, this advantage is obtained only for specific
graphs or when a single node of the underlying graph is marked. In this
article, we provide a new continuous-time quantum walk search algorithm that
completely resolves this: our algorithm can find a marked node in any graph
with any number of marked nodes, in a time that is quadratically faster than
classical random walks. The overall algorithm is quite simple, requiring time
evolution of the quantum walk Hamiltonian followed by a projective measurement.
A key component of our algorithm is a purely analog procedure to perform
operations on a state of the form $e^{-tH^2}|\psi\rangle$, for a given
Hamiltonian $H$: it only requires evolving $H$ for time scaling as $\sqrt{t}$.
This allows us to quadratically fast-forward the dynamics of a continuous-time
classical random walk. The applications of our work thus go beyond the realm of
quantum walks and can lead to new analog quantum algorithms for preparing
ground states of Hamiltonians or solving optimization problems.

community, since they promise significant improvements in the performance of
neural network architectures. However, in any specific problem, we still lack a
principled way to choose specific mechanisms and hyper-parameters that lead to
guaranteed improvements. More recently, self-attention has been proposed and
widely used in transformer-like architectures, leading to significant
breakthroughs in some applications. In this work we focus on two forms of
attention mechanisms: attention modules and self-attention. Attention modules
are used to reweight the features of each layer input tensor. Different modules
have different ways to perform this reweighting in fully connected or
convolutional layers. The attention models studied are completely modular and
in this work they will be used with the popular ResNet architecture.
Self-Attention, originally proposed in the area of Natural Language Processing
makes it possible to relate all the items in an input sequence. Self-Attention
is becoming increasingly popular in Computer Vision, where it is sometimes
combined with convolutional layers, although some recent architectures do away
entirely with convolutions. In this work, we study and perform an objective
comparison of a number of different attention mechanisms in a specific computer
vision task, the classification of samples in the widely used Skin Cancer MNIST
dataset. The results show that attention modules do sometimes improve the
performance of convolutional neural network architectures, but also that this
improvement, although noticeable and statistically significant, is not
consistent in different settings. The results obtained with self-attention
mechanisms, on the other hand, show consistent and significant improvements,
leading to the best results even in architectures with a reduced number of

multi-frequency structure in the rotating signal, reflecting the presence of
significant rigid body components in the rotational motion. Using the formalism

by the low frequency components in the determination of the moment of inertia

of which is the dispersion relation of energy diffusion. As expected, we see
that the standard derivative expansion of that dispersion relation, $\omega=-i
D_{(1)} k^2- i D_{(2)} k^4+\mathcal{O}(k^6)$, breaks down due to the long-time
tails. However, we find that the nonlinear contribution of order $n$ to the
self-energy is proportional to $\left(k^{2}\right)^{n+1/2}$. This suggests to
modify the dispersion relation by splitting it into two dispersion relations
and double the number of transport coefficients at any order as $\omega=-i

in cross-correlation based velocimetry or on scattered points as in tracking
velocimetry. The proposed approach is based on Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)
regression and relies on the solution of two constrained least square problems.
The first one is the regression of the measurements to create an analytic
representation of the velocity field. This regression can be constrained to
impose boundary conditions (e.g. no-slip velocity on a wall or inlet
conditions) or differential constraints (e.g. the solenoidal condition for an
incompressible flow). The second one is the meshless integration of the
pressure Poisson equation, achieved by seeking a solution in the form of a RBF
expansion and using constraints to impose boundary conditions.
  We first illustrate the derivation of the two least square problems and the
numerical techniques implemented for their solution. Then, we showcase the
method with three numerical test cases of growing complexity. These are a 2D
Gaussian Vortex, a 2D flow past a cylinder from CFD and a 3D Stokes flow past a
sphere. For each case, we consider randomly sampled vector fields simulating

the electron gyroradius). The same law with $\alpha\!\simeq\!0.94$ and an
exponential decay characterized by $\lambda\!\simeq\!0.87\rho_e$ is observed in
the electron velocity spectrum but not in the ion velocity spectrum that drops
like a steep power law $\sim k^{-3.25}$ before reaching electron scales. By
analyzing the filtered energy conversion channels, we find that the electrons
play a major role with respect to the ions in driving the magnetic field
dynamics at kinetic scales. Our analysis reveals the presence of an indirect
electron-driven mechanism that channels the e.m. energy from large to sub-ion
scale more efficiently than the direct nonlinear scale-to-scale transfer of
e.m. energy. This mechanism consists of three steps: in the first step the e.m.
energy is converted into electron fluid flow energy at large scales; in the
second step the electron fluid flow energy is nonlinearly transferred towards
sub-ion scales; in the final step the electron fluid flow energy is converted
back into e.m. energy at sub-ion scales. This electron-driven transfer drives
the magnetic field cascade up to fully developed turbulence, after which
dissipation becomes dominant and the electrons start to subtract energy from
the magnetic field and dissipate it via the pressure-strain interaction at
sub-ion scales.

Our hypothesis is that formal methods still seem not to be applicable enough or
ready for their intended use. In critical software engineering, what do we mean
when we speak of a formal method? And what does it mean for such a method to be
applicable both from a scientific and practical viewpoint? Based on what the
literature tells about the first question, with this manifesto, we lay out a
set of principles that when followed by a formal method give rise to its mature
applicability in a given scope. Rather than exercising criticism of past

specialized sensors (e.g., synchronized multi-camera systems), or pre-built 3D

diverse sets of objects in the wild. We present BANMo, a method that requires
neither a specialized sensor nor a pre-defined template shape. BANMo builds
high-fidelity, articulated 3D models (including shape and animatable skinning
weights) from many monocular casual videos in a differentiable rendering
framework. While the use of many videos provides more coverage of camera views
and object articulations, they introduce significant challenges in establishing
correspondence across scenes with different backgrounds, illumination
conditions, etc. Our key insight is to merge three schools of thought; (1)
classic deformable shape models that make use of articulated bones and blend
skinning, (2) volumetric neural radiance fields (NeRFs) that are amenable to
gradient-based optimization, and (3) canonical embeddings that generate
correspondences between pixels and an articulated model. We introduce neural
blend skinning models that allow for differentiable and invertible articulated
deformations. When combined with canonical embeddings, such models allow us to
establish dense correspondences across videos that can be self-supervised with
cycle consistency. On real and synthetic datasets, BANMo shows higher-fidelity
3D reconstructions than prior works for humans and animals, with the ability to
render realistic images from novel viewpoints and poses. Project webpage:

very accurate interferometric calibration. Closure quantities may circumvent
the calibration requirements but may be, however, affected by direction
dependent effects, particularly antenna primary beam responses. This work
investigates the impact of antenna primary beams affected by mutual coupling on
the closure phase and its power spectrum. Our simulations show that primary
beams affected by mutual coupling lead to a leakage of foreground power into
the EoR window, which can be up to $\sim4$ orders magnitude higher than the
case where no mutual coupling is considered. This leakage is, however,
essentially confined at $k < 0.3$~$h$~Mpc$^{-1}$ for triads that include 29~m
baselines. The leakage magnitude is more pronounced when bright foregrounds
appear in the antenna sidelobes, as expected. Finally, we find that triads that
include mutual coupling beams different from each other have power spectra
similar to triads that include the same type of mutual coupling beam,
indicating that beam-to-beam variation within triads (or visibility pairs) is
not the major source of foreground leakage in the EoR window.

environmental benefits of battery-powered electric motors with the longer
mileage and autonomy of conventional internal combustion engines. This
combination is particularly advantageous for time-constrained delivery routing
in dense urban areas, where battery recharging along routes can be too
time-consuming to economically justify the use of all-electric vehicles.
However, switching from electric to conventional fossil fuel modes also results
in higher costs and emissions and lower efficiency. This paper analyzes this
heterogeneous vehicle routing problem and describes two solution methods: an
exact branch-price-and-cut algorithm and an iterated tabu search metaheuristic.
From a methodological perspective, we find that the exact algorithm
consistently obtains tight lower bounds that also serve to certify the
metaheuristic solutions as near-optimal. From a policy standpoint, we examine a
large-scale real-world case study concerning parcel deliveries in the Chicago
metropolitan area and quantify various operational metrics including energy
costs and vehicle miles traveled. We find that by deploying roughly 20% of
range-extended vehicles with a modest all-electric range of 33 miles, parcel
distributors can save energy costs by up to 17% while incurring less than 0.5%
increase in vehicle miles traveled. Increasing the range to 60 miles further
reduces costs by only 4%, which can alternatively be achieved by decreasing the
average service time by 1 minute or increasing driver working time by 1 hour.
Our study reveals several key areas of improvement on which vehicle
manufacturers, distributors, and policy makers can focus their attention.

visible sector at least via the gravitational interaction. In this paper, we
show that a scalar field in such a hidden sector generically couples to the
quadratic curvature via dimension five operators, i.e., $\phi R^2$, $\phi
R^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu}$, $\phi R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$, $\phi

there exist particles heavier than it. We derive these scalar couplings to the
quadratic curvature by integrating out heavy particles in a systematic manner.
Such couplings are of phenomenological interest since some of them induce the
scalar decay into the graviton pair. We point out that the decay of a scalar
field can produce a substantial amount of the stochastic cosmic graviton
background at high frequency since the suppression scale of these operators is
given by the mass of heavy particles not by the Planck scale. The resultant

the lowest charge $+1$ overall excitation at $\nu=-1$, and also for some large

very small binding energy. At other fillings, we show that trion bound states
do exist, but only for momentum ranges that do not cover the entire moir\'e

parameter range $w_0/w_1$ but they all disappear in the continuum far below the
realistic values of $w_0/w_1= 0.8$. We find the conditions for the existence of
the trion bound state, a good variational wavefunction for it, and investigate
its behavior for different screening lengths, at all integer fillings, on both

weak in local finer-level feature learning. The performance of local
self-attention (LSA) is just on par with convolution and inferior to dynamic
filters, which puzzles researchers on whether to use LSA or its counterparts,
which one is better, and what makes LSA mediocre. To clarify these, we
comprehensively investigate LSA and its counterparts from two sides:
\emph{channel setting} and \emph{spatial processing}. We find that the devil
lies in the generation and application of spatial attention, where relative
position embeddings and the neighboring filter application are key factors.
Based on these findings, we propose the enhanced local self-attention (ELSA)
with Hadamard attention and the ghost head. Hadamard attention introduces the
Hadamard product to efficiently generate attention in the neighboring case,
while maintaining the high-order mapping. The ghost head combines attention
maps with static matrices to increase channel capacity. Experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of ELSA. Without architecture / hyperparameter modification,
drop-in replacing LSA with ELSA boosts Swin Transformer \cite{swin} by up to
+1.4 on top-1 accuracy. ELSA also consistently benefits VOLO \cite{volo} from
D1 to D5, where ELSA-VOLO-D5 achieves 87.2 on the ImageNet-1K without extra

significantly improves the baseline by up to +1.9 box Ap / +1.3 mask Ap on the

formation enhancement and have been discussed to be compatible with a sequence
of recent minor mergers. In order to probe merger induced star formation
mechanisms, we conducted observations of the molecular gas content of 35
star-forming DP galaxies in the upper part of the main sequence (MS) of star
formation with the IRAM 30m telescope. Including similar galaxies 0.3 dex above
MS and with existing molecular gas observations from the literature, we finally
obtain a sample of 52 such galaxies. We succeed in fitting the same kinematic
parameters to the optical ionised and molecular gas emission lines for 10 (19%)
galaxies. We find a central star formation enhancement resulting most likely
from a galaxy merger or galaxy interaction, which is indicated by an excess of
gas extinction found in the centre. This star formation is traced by radio
continuum emissions at 150MHz, 1.4 and 3GHz, which are all three linearly
correlated in log with the CO luminosity with the same slope. The 52 DP
galaxies are found to have a significantly larger amount of molecular gas and
larger depletion times, hence a lower star formation efficiency, than the
expected values at their distance of the MS. This is consistent with a scenario
of minor mergers increasing the mass of bulges and driving gas to the centre.
We also exclude the inwards directed gas migration and central star formation
enhancement to be the origin of a bar morphology. Hence, these 52 DP galaxies
could be the results of recent minor mergers that funnelled molecular gas
towards their centre, triggering star formation, but with a moderate
efficiency.

the magnetizations of the ferromagnets between parallel and antiparallel
configurations in F1SF2 and SF1F2 trilayers, or in SF bilayers with both Rashba
and Dresselhaus SOC. It was recently reported that geometric curvature can
control the generation of long ranged triplets. We use this property to show
that the superconducting critical temperature of an SF hybrid nanowire can be
tuned by varying the curvature of the ferromagnetic side alone, with no need of
another ferromagnet or SOC. We show that the variation of the critical
temperature as a function of the curvature can be exploited to obtain a robust,
curvature-controlled, superconducting triplet spin-valve effect. Furthermore,
we perform an analysis with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling and explain
how it modifies the spin-valve effect both quantitatively and qualitatively.

these differences through the ratios between the following mass- and

densities. We find that the mass-to-light ratios of these properties change
with $t_{\rm lb}$, more the more massive the galaxies are. The CLE galaxy
archaeological progenitors are, on average, less compact, concentrated, and
dense in light than in mass as $z$ decreases. However, at later times, when
also the evolution of the progenitors becomes passive at all radii, there is an
upturn in these trends and the differences between mass and light in
compactness/concentration decrease towards $z\sim 0$. The trends in the ratios
of mass to light sizes agree qualitatively with results from direct
observations in galaxy surveys at different redshifts. We discuss the caveats

evolution found in some previous studies for early-type galaxies could be
explained partially by photometric changes rather than by intrinsic structural
changes.

Telescope Coronagraph to light scattered by exozodi, the zodiacal dust around
other stars. Using a sample of 149 nearby stars, previously selected for
optimum detection of habitable exoplanets by space observatories, we find the

zone boundaries is six and the number of observable outer habitable boundaries
is 74. One zodi was defined as the visible-light surface brightness of 22
$m_{\rm V}\ $arcsec$^{-2}$ around a solar-mass star, approximating the
scattered light brightness in visible light at the Earth-equivalent insolation.
In the speckle limited case, where the signal-to-noise ratio is limited by
speckle temporal stability rather than shot noise, the median $5\sigma$
sensitivity to habitable zone exozodi is 12 zodi per resolution element. This
estimate is calculated at the inner-working angle of the coronagraph, for the
current best estimate performance, neglecting margins on the uncertainty in
instrument performance and including a post-processing speckle suppression
factor. For an log-norm distribution of exozodi levels with a median exozodi of
3$\times$ the solar zodi, we find that the Roman Coronagraph would be able to
make 5$\sigma$ detections of exozodiacal disks in scattered light from 13
systems with a 95\% confidence interval spanning 7-20 systems. This sensitivity
allows Roman Coronagraph to complement ground-based measurements of exozodiacal

Focussing on the late-time evolution, we test the model against current data.

Carlo Markov Chains method of integration on the free parameters of the model.
We find that the mean values of the free parameters constrained by observations
lie within suitable theoretical ranges, and the evolution of the scalar fields
provides a good resemblance to the features of the dark sector of the universe.
Such behaviour is confirmed by the outcomes of widely adopted selection
criteria, suggesting a statistical evidence comparable to that of the standard

degraded image quality due to environmental factors, camera placement, etc. To
address this issue, we propose a deep sensor fusion framework which estimates
vehicle motion using both pose and uncertainty estimations from multiple
on-board cameras. We extract spatio-temporal feature representations from a set
of consecutive images using a hybrid CNN - RNN model. We then utilise a Mixture
Density Network (MDN) to estimate the 6-DoF pose as a mixture of distributions
and a fusion module to estimate the final pose using MDN outputs from
multi-cameras. We evaluate our approach on the publicly available, large scale
autonomous vehicle dataset, nuScenes. The results show that the proposed fusion
approach surpasses the state-of-the-art, and provides robust estimates and
accurate trajectories compared to individual camera-based estimations.

greater stability of old knowledge consolidation, but also acquires
advantageous adaptability to new knowledge with very limited data samples.

are the best to detect CPDs. Longer is the wavelength, the smaller mass
planet's CPD could be detected. MIRI on JWST and METIS on ELT offers the best
possibility on these telescopes. Specifically, below 3 $\mu$m, only 10
$M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ planets with their CPDs are detectable with NIRCam and
MICADO. 5 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ planets are only detectable if at 30 AU (i.e.
closer) orbital separation. Planets above 5 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ with their CPDs
are detectable between 3-5 $\mu$m with NIRCam and METIS L/M band, or above 10
$\mu$m with MIRI and METIS N band. For $\leq$ 1 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ planets > 15
$\mu$m are needed, where MIRI uniquely offers imaging capability. We present
magnitudes and spectral energy distributions for separate components of the

  Research Questions: 1) To what extent are developers' needs, in terms of

  Methodology: Wikipedia articles were systematically collected from SO posts.
The most cited were manually mapped to the SEEK knowledge units, assessed
according to their degree of coverage. Articles insufficiently covered by the
SEEK were classified by hand using the 2012 ACM Computing Classification

seek advice, best practices and explanations about software topics, and code
review assistance. Future SEEK models and the computing education could dive
deeper in information systems, design, testing, security, and soft skills.

the limiting sensing knowledge is calculated from the available stellar flux
and grasp of a telescope within the available volume. These inputs are
integrated using a model-predictive control scheme. For a simple test case at 1
Hz, with an 85 mm telescope and a single 11th magnitude star, the achievable
body pointing is predicted to be 0.39 arcseconds. For a more general limit,
integrating available star light, the achievable attitude sensing is
approximately 1 milliarcsecond, which leads to a predicted body pointing
accuracy of 20 milliarcseconds after application of the control model. These
results show significant room for attitude sensing and control systems to

been developed to measure the OPD, or differential 'piston' of the wavefront,
induced by the atmosphere at each telescope. Previously, this method was
outlined and results obtained from LBT adaptive optics (AO) data for a single
telescope aperture were presented. P-REx has now been applied off-line to
previously acquired VLT's GRAVITY CIAO wavefront sensing data to estimate the
atmospheric OPD for the six VLTI baselines. Comparisons with the OPD obtained
from the VLTI GRAVITY fringe tracker were made. The results indicate that the
telescope and instrumental noise of the combined VLTI and GRAVITY systems
dominate over the atmospheric turbulence contributions. However, good agreement
between simulated and on-sky P-REx data indicates that if the telescope and
instrumental noise were reduced to atmospheric piston noise levels, P-REx has
the potential to reduce the OPD root mean square of piston turbulence by up to
a factor of 10 for frequencies down to 1 Hz. In such conditions, P-REx will
assist in pushing the sensitivity limits of optical fringe tracking with long
baseline interferometers.

damage. Comet assays are a popular way of estimating the extent of DNA damage.
Current literature on the use of deep learning to quantify DNA damage presents
an empirical approach to hyper-parameter optimization and does not include
uncertainty estimates. Deep ensemble averaging is a standard approach to
estimating uncertainty but it requires several iterations of network training,
which makes it time-consuming. Here we present an approach to quantify the
extent of DNA damage that combines deep learning with a rigorous and
comprehensive method to optimize the hyper-parameters with the help of
statistical tests. We also use an architecture that allows for a faster
computation of deep ensemble averaging and performs statistical tests
applicable to networks using transfer learning. We applied our approach to a
comet assay dataset with more than 1300 images and achieved an $R^2$ of 0.84,
where the output included the confidence interval for each prediction. The
proposed architecture is an improvement over the current approaches since it
speeds up the uncertainty estimation by 30X while being statistically more
rigorous.

dimensional and non-linear history-dependent problems in computational
mechanics since they offer the possibility to drastically reduce the
computational time. This feature has recently been exploited in the context of
multi-scale simulations, in which the NNWs serve as surrogate model of
micro-scale finite element resolutions. Nevertheless, in the literature, mainly
the macro-stress-macro-strain response of the meso-scale boundary value problem
was considered and the micro-structure information could not be recovered in a
so-called localization step. In this work, we develop Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) as surrogates of the RVE response while being able to recover the
evolution of the local micro-structure state variables for complex loading
scenarios. The main difficulty is the high dimensionality of the RNNs output
which consists in the internal state variable distribution in the
micro-structure. We thus propose and compare several surrogate models based on
a dimensionality reduction: i) direct RNN modeling with implicit NNW
dimensionality reduction, ii) RNN with PCA dimensionality reduction, and iii)
RNN with PCA dimensionality reduction and dimensionality break down, i.e. the
use of several RNNs instead of a single one. Besides, we optimize the
sequential training strategy of the latter surrogate for GPU usage in order to
speed up the process. Finally, through RNN modeling of the principal components
coefficients, the connection between the physical state variables and the
hidden variables of the RNN is revealed, and exploited in order to select the
hyper-parameters of the RNN-based surrogate models in their design stage.

scientific practices and confirmed that: (1) even when dealing with highly
imbalanced datasets, the community tends to use metrics that are dominated by
the majority class; and (2) it is still uncommon to include calibration studies

(i.e., abstract paths consisting of node and link types) to predict user
preference, and have attracted a lot of attention due to their explainability
and performance. We observe that the performance of MPRs is highly sensitive to
the meta-paths they use, but existing works manually select the meta-paths from
many possible ones. Thus, to discover effective meta-paths automatically, we
propose the Reinforcement learning-based Meta-path Selection (RMS) framework.
Specifically, we define a vector encoding for meta-paths and design a policy
network to extend meta-paths. The policy network is trained based on the
results of downstream recommendation tasks and an early stopping approximation
strategy is proposed to speed up training. RMS is a general model, and it can
work with all existing MPRs. We also propose a new MPR called RMS-HRec, which
uses an attention mechanism to aggregate information from the meta-paths. We
conduct extensive experiments on real datasets. Compared with the manually
selected meta-paths, the meta-paths identified by RMS consistently improve
recommendation quality. Moreover, RMS-HRec outperforms state-of-the-art
recommender systems by an average of 7% in hit ratio. The codes and datasets

high-redshift and remained almost unchanged since then. In this work, we search
for analogues to relic galaxies in the TNG50 cosmological simulations to
understand relic formation and test the ability of TNG50 to reproduce such rare
objects. Using stellar mass, age, radius, quiescence and stellar assembly
criteria, we find 5 subhalos in TNG50 that could be potential relic analogues.
We compare their properties with other constraints imposed by a sample of 13
observed relic galaxies. We find one analogue in TNG50 that simultaneously
satisfies most of the available observational constraints, such as metallicity
and morphology. It also shows similarities to the confirmed relic NGC 1277,
regarding environment and dark matter fraction. By taking into account a degree
of relicness, a second relic analogue may also be considered. However, the
central parts of the brightness and density profiles of the analogues are less
steep than that of real relic galaxies, possibly due to limited numerical
resolution. We identify two formation pathways of relic analogues in TNG50
depending on their environment: they either have their remaining gas stripped
during the infall into a cluster at $z \lesssim 1.2$ or consume it before $z >
1.5$. They are then deprived of significant star formation, leaving their
stellar populations almost unaltered during the last 9 Gyr. We also find that
the analogue progenitors at $z \sim 4$ inhabit more massive halos than
progenitors of quiescent galaxies with similar stellar mass at $z \sim 0$.

kinematically reconstruct the neutrino properties from the decay incoming and
outgoing charged particles. The reconstruction of these particles relies on the
recent progress and on-going developments in silicon particle detector

mega-ton scale natural deep water Cherenkov detectors. The coarseness of this
type of detectors is overcome by the precision of the tagging and, conversely,
the rate limitation imposed by the tagging is outweighed by the virtually
unlimited size of the detector. These mutual benefits result in an affordable

pressure (BP) is often measured non-invasively in an intermittent manner. This
practice has a risk of missing clinically relevant BP changes between two
adjacent intermittent BP measurements. This study proposes a method to
non-invasively estimate systolic blood pressure (SBP) with high accuracy in
patients undergoing surgery. Methods: Continuous arterial BP,
electrocardiography (ECG), and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals were acquired
from 29 patients undergoing surgery. After extracting 9 features from the PPG
and ECG signals, we dynamically selected features upon each intermittent
measurement (every 10 min) of SBP based on feature robustness and the principle
of correlation-based feature selection. Finally, multiple linear regression
models were built to combine these features to estimate SBP every 30 s.
Results: Compared to the reference SBP, the proposed method achieved a mean of
difference at 0.08 mmHg, a standard deviation of difference at 7.97 mmHg, and a
correlation coefficient at 0.89 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study
demonstrates the feasibility of non-invasively estimating SBP every 30 s with
high accuracy during surgery by using ECG, PPG, and intermittent SBP
measurements every 10 min, which meets the standard of the Association for the
Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. The proposed method has the potential
to enhance BP monitoring in the operating room, improving patient outcomes and
experiences.

fractional transformation (LFT) system that adequately captures the dynamics of
a nonlinear time-invariant system over some desired envelope. First, the
nonlinear system is approximated as a polynomial nonlinear state-space (PNLSS)
system, and a linear parameter-varying (LPV) representation of the PNLSS model
is obtained. To reduce the potentially large number of scheduling parameters in
the resulting LPV system, an approach based on the cascade feedforward neural
network (CFNN) is proposed. We account for the approximation and reduction
errors through the addition of a norm-bounded, causal, dynamic uncertainty in
the LFT system. Falsification is used in a novel way to perform guided
simulations for deriving a norm bound on the dynamic uncertainty and generating
data for training the CFNN. Then, robustness analysis using integral quadratic
constraint theory is carried out to choose an LFT representation that leads to
a computationally tractable analysis problem and useful analysis results.
Finally, the proposed approach is used to obtain an LFT representation for the
nonlinear equations of motion of a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system.

further identify a trade-off between privacy and communication efficiency due

navigating an agent to automatically complete various reasoning tasks over an

However, existing multi-hop reasoning approaches only work well on short
reasoning paths and tend to miss the target entity with the increasing path
length. This is undesirable for many reason-ing tasks in real-world scenarios,
where short paths connecting the source and target entities are not available
in incomplete KGs, and thus the reasoning performances drop drastically unless

challenge in long paths by assigning one of the agents (GIANT) searching on
cluster-level paths quickly and providing stage-wise hints for another agent

that our approach can search answers more accurately and efficiently, and
outperforms existing RL-based methods for long path queries by a large margin.

Meanwhile our understanding of whether and how changes in vegetation cover
could trigger abrupt transitions in moisture regimes remains incomplete. This
challenge calls for better evidence as well as for the theoretical concepts to
describe it. Here we briefly summarise the theoretical questions surrounding
the role of vegetation cover in the dynamics of a moist atmosphere. We discuss
the previously unrecognized sensitivity of local wind power to condensation
rate as revealed by our analysis of the continuity equation for a gas mixture.
Using the framework of condensation-induced atmospheric dynamics, we then show
that with the temperature contrast between land and ocean increasing up to a
critical threshold, ocean-to-land moisture transport reaches a tipping point
where it can stop or even reverse. Land-ocean temperature contrasts are
affected by both global and regional processes, in particular, by the surface
fluxes of sensible and latent heat that are strongly influenced by vegetation.
Our results clarify how a disturbance of natural vegetation cover, e.g., by
deforestation, can disrupt large-scale atmospheric circulation and moisture
transport. In view of the increasing pressure on natural ecosystems, successful
strategies of mitigating climate change require taking into account the impact
of vegetation on moist atmospheric dynamics. Our analysis provides a
theoretical framework to assess this impact. The available data for Eurasia
indicate that the observed climatological land-ocean temperature contrasts are
close to the threshold. This can explain the increasing fluctuations in the

framework for studying the possible ""reasonable"" complete classifications and
the complexity of possible classifying invariants for $E$, such that: (1) the
standard results and intuitions regarding classifications by countable
structures are preserved in this framework; (2) this framework respects Borel
reducibility; (3) this framework allows for a precise study of the possible
invariants of certain equivalence relations which are not classifiable by
countable structures, such as $E_1$.
  In this framework we show that $E_1$ can be classified, with classifying
invariants which are $\kappa$-sequences of $E_0$-classes where
$\kappa=\mathfrak{b}$, and it cannot be classified in such a manner if
$\kappa<\mathbf{add}(\mathcal{B})$.
  These results depend on analyzing the following sub-model of a Cohen real
extension, introduced by Kanovei-Sabok-Zapletal (2013) and Larson-Zapletal
(2020). Let $\left<c_n:\,n<\omega\right>$ be a generic sequence of Cohen reals,
and define the tail intersection model
  $$M=\bigcap_{n<\omega}V[\left<c_m:\,m\geq n\right>].$$ An analysis of reals
in $M$ will provide lower bounds for the possible invariants for $E_1$.
  We also extend the characterization of turbulence from Larson-Zapletal (2020)

  Although wetting agents have been developed to limit tear film dewetting over
contact lenses, systematic analyses correlating wetting agents properties to
mechanisms of the tear film destabilization are not readily available.
Clarifying destabilization characteristics across key physio-chemical variables
will provide a rational basis for identifying optimal wetting agents.
  Experiments:
  We employ an in-house, in vitro platform to comprehensively evaluate drainage
and dewetting dynamics of five wetting agents across seventeen different
formulations and two model tear film solutions: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and artificial tear solution (ATS). We consider the film thickness evolution,
film thickness at breakup, dewetted front propagation, and develop correlations
to contact angle to compare the samples.
  Findings:
  Zwitterionic wetting agents effectively stabilize the tear film by reducing
the film thickness at the onset of dewetting, and delaying dewetted region
propagation across the lens. Furthermore, tuning wetting agent surface
concentrations in binary mixtures can enhance wetting characteristics. Finally,
despite disparities in wetting agent molecular properties, the time to dewet
$50\%$ of the lens scales linearly with the product of the receding contact
angle and contact angle hysteresis. Hence, we fundamentally establish the
importance of minimizing both the absolute contact angle values and contact
angle hysteresis for effective wetting performance.

facilitates swapping priors, simple implementation and computationally
efficient thinning. In particular, our approach is well suited to local PDMP

Here, we report multifaceted spatial-dependent magnetism in few-layer CrSBr

to multiple coexisting magnetic ground states at temperatures close to the bulk

reliably suppressed using modest fields (~300 Oe) from the MFM probe, behaving

the decision tree training algorithm is based on the divide-and-conquer
paradigm, where dummy rows are added after each split in order to hide the
number of rows in the dataset. We resolve this issue via secure data structure
that enables us to compute an aggregate value for every group while hiding the
grouping information. By using this data structure, we can train a decision
tree without adding dummy rows while hiding the size of the intermediate data.
We specifically describes a decision tree training protocol that requires only
$O(hmn\log n)$ comparisons when the input attributes are continuous and the
output attribute is binary. Note that the order is now \emph{linear} in the
tree height $h$. To demonstrate the practicality of our protocol, we implement
it in an MPC framework based on a three-party secret sharing scheme. Our

major challenges for existing techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC). These problems are exacerbated in high-dimensional settings where MCMC
methods typically rely upon localised proposal mechanisms. This paper
introduces the Annealed Leap-Point Sampler (ALPS), which augments the target
distribution state space with modified annealed (cooled) target distributions,
in contrast to traditional approaches which have employed tempering. The
temperature of the coldest state is chosen such that its corresponding annealed
target density can be sufficiently well-approximated by a Laplace
approximation. As a result, a Gaussian mixture independence Metropolis-Hastings
sampler can perform mode-jumping proposals even in high-dimensional problems.
The ability of this procedure to ""mode hop"" at this super-cold state is then
filtered through to the target state using a sequence of tempered targets in a
similar way to that in parallel tempering methods. ALPS also incorporates the
best aspects of current gold-standard approaches to multimodal sampling in
high-dimensional contexts. A theoretical analysis of the ALPS approach in high
dimensions is given, providing practitioners with a gauge on the optimal setup
as well as the scalability of the algorithm. For a $d$-dimensional problem the
it is shown that the coldest inverse temperature level required for the ALPS
only needs to be linear in the dimension, $\mathcal{O}(d)$, and this means that
for a collection of multimodal problems the algorithmic cost is polynomial,
$\mathcal{O}\left(d^{3}\right)$. ALPS is illustrated on a complex multimodal
posterior distribution that arises from a seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR)
model of longitudinal data from U.S. manufacturing firms.

Most of the existing clustering methods for this type of data are tailored to

extract the information from the dependence structure for clustering, we
propose a new latent variable model for the features arranged in matrix form,
with some unknown membership matrices representing the clusters for the rows
and columns. Under this model, we further propose a class of hierarchical
clustering algorithms using the difference of a weighted covariance matrix as
the dissimilarity measure. Theoretically, we show that under mild conditions,
our algorithm attains clustering consistency in the high-dimensional setting.
While this consistency result holds for our algorithm with a broad class of
weighted covariance matrices, the conditions for this result depend on the
choice of the weight. To investigate how the weight affects the theoretical
performance of our algorithm, we establish the minimax lower bound for
clustering under our latent variable model. Given these results, we identify
the optimal weight in the sense that using this weight guarantees our algorithm
to be minimax rate-optimal in terms of the magnitude of some cluster separation
metric. The practical implementation of our algorithm with the optimal weight
is also discussed. Finally, we conduct simulation studies to evaluate the
finite sample performance of our algorithm and apply the method to a genomic

these subgraphs are sequentially connected by their root nodes and merged into
a complete graph. Based on this graph, we devise a graph convolutional network

a good solution, but tend to over-fit to the model, and hence a small number of
adversarial corruptions can cause the algorithm to fail.
  In this paper, we give the first robust algorithms for Packing Integer
Programs, specifically in the recently proposed Byzantine Secretary framework.
Our techniques are based on a two-level use of online learning, to robustly
learn an approximation to the optimal value, and then to use this robust
estimate to pick a good solution. These techniques are general and we use them
to design robust algorithms for PIPs in the prophet model as well, specifically
in the Prophet-with-Augmentations framework. We also improve known results in
the Byzantine Secretary framework: we make the non-constructive results
algorithmic and improve the existing bounds for single-item and matroid
constraints.

nanoclusters in the whole temperature range from 0 K to melting is developed.
Our approach relies on Parallel Tempering Molecular Dynamics (PTMD) simulations
complemented by Harmonic Superposition Approximation (HSA) calculations and
global optimization searches, thus combining the accuracy of global
optimization and HSA in describing the low-energy part of configuration space,
together with the PTDM thorough sampling of high-energy configurations. This
combined methodology is shown to be instrumental towards revealing the
temperature-dependent structural motifs in Au nanoclusters of sizes 90, 147,
and 201 atoms. The reported phenomenology is particularly rich, displaying a
size- and temperature-dependent competition between the global energy minimum
and other structural motifs. In the case of Au$_{90}$ and Au$_{147}$, the
global minimum is also the dominant structure at finite temperatures. In
contrast, the Au$_{201}$ cluster undergoes a solid-solid transformation at low
temperature (< 200 K). Results indicate that PTMD and HSA very well agree at
intermediate temperatures, between 300 and 400 K. For higher temperatures, PTMD
gives an accurate description of equilibrium, while HSA fails in describing the
melting range. On the other hand, HSA is more efficient in catching
low-temperature structural transitions. Finally, we describe the elusive
structures close to the melting region which can present complex and defective
geometries, that are otherwise difficult to characterize through experimental
imaging.

Firstly, we transfer the voxelized scenes to point clouds by removing these
visible empty voxels and adopt a deep point stream to capture semantic
information from the scene efficiently. Meanwhile, a light-weight voxel stream
containing only two 3D convolution layers preserves local structures of the
voxelized scenes. Furthermore, we design an anisotropic voxel aggregation
operator to fuse the structure details from the voxel stream into the point
stream, and a semantic-aware propagation module to enhance the up-sampling
process in the point stream by semantic labels. We demonstrate that our model
surpasses state-of-the-arts on two benchmarks by a large margin, with only

the US has created troves of computable data, to which machine learning methods
have been applied to extract useful insights. EHR data, represented as a
three-dimensional analogue of a matrix (tensor), is decomposed into
two-dimensional factors that can be interpreted as computational phenotypes.
Methods: We apply constrained tensor factorization to derive computational
phenotypes and predict mortality in cohorts of patients with breast, prostate,
colorectal, or lung cancer in the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data
Warehouse from 2000 to 2015. In our experiments, we examined using a supervised
term in the factorization algorithm, filtering tensor co-occurrences by medical
indication, and incorporating additional social determinants of health (SDOH)
covariates in the factorization process. We evaluated the resulting
computational phenotypes qualitatively and by assessing their ability to
predict five-year mortality using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic.
Results: Filtering by medical indication led to more concise and interpretable
phenotypes. Mortality prediction performance (AUC) varied under the different
experimental conditions and by cancer type (breast: 0.623 - 0.694, prostate:
0.603 - 0.750, colorectal: 0.523 - 0.641, and lung: 0.517 - 0.623). Generally,
prediction performance improved with the use of a supervised term and the
incorporation of SDOH covariates. Conclusion: Constrained tensor factorization,
applied to sparse EHR data of patients with cancer, can discover computational
phenotypes predictive of five-year mortality. The incorporation of SDOH
variables into the factorization algorithm is an easy-to-implement and
effective way to improve prediction performance.

established at 300 K and no evidence of structural phase transitions was found
up to 1000 K. The thermal expansion of the crystal lattice is strongly
anisotropic. At $T<T_c=550$ K, a large thermal expansion along the c-axis is
observed with simultaneous contraction along a-axis. The activation energy of
the conductivity decreases significantly at high temperatures and follows the
thermal expansion variation, that exhibits two electronic transitions at ~500
and ~700 K, in coincidence with the anomalies of the heat capacity. Electronic
transport was found to be a dominant conduction mechanism in the entire
temperature range. The temperature dependence of the effective magnetic moment
reflects the evolution of the spin state of Co$^{3+}$ ions towards the spin
crossover to a high spin state. The interrelation between the crystal structure

Changes in the interfacial tension crucially attribute to a governing capillary

current study attempts to elucidate an influence of such changes on spontaneous
imbibition by replacing surfactant concentration consecutively with two
approaches: sequential decrease and sequential increase in the interfacial
tension. Two fluid flow directions were examined simultaneously: co-current and
counter-current flows. With strongly oil-wet wettability, capillarity was a
resisting element to oil displacement and therefore controlled by the oil-water
interfacial tension. The sequential-reduced interfacial tension was found to
weaken such resisting capillary force gradually and resulted in consecutive
incremental oil production. On the contrary, the sequential-increased
interfacial tension initiated the lowest interfacial tension fluid that
produced an immediate large amount of oil, but did not much displace further
oil. The current study observed a greater oil recovery obtained from a
sequential reduction in the interfacial tension scheme (26.9%) compared to a
conventional single reduction scheme (22.4%), with both schemes attaining same
interfacial tension at last. In counter-current imbibition, same
characteristics of oil displacement were observed as in co-current imbibition,
with less oil produced and less sensitive to fluid changes due to negligible

  Spaces","need to be improved further",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful classification method that has
achieved great success in many fields. Since its performance can be seriously
impaired by redundant covariates, model selection techniques are widely used
for SVM with high dimensional covariates. As an alternative to model selection,
significant progress has been made in the area of model averaging in the past
decades. Yet no frequentist model averaging method was considered for SVM. This
work aims to fill the gap and to propose a frequentist model averaging
procedure for SVM which selects the optimal weight by cross validation. Even
when the number of covariates diverges at an exponential rate of the sample
size, we show asymptotic optimality of the proposed method in the sense that
the ratio of its hinge loss to the lowest possible loss converges to one. We
also derive the convergence rate which provides more insights to model
averaging. Compared to model selection methods of SVM which require a tedious
but critical task of tuning parameter selection, the model averaging method
avoids the task and shows promising performances in the empirical studies.

time complexity or sub-optimal designs. In this work, we propose a novel SGG

relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new entity-aware predicate
representation based on a structural predicate generator that leverages the
compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a graph assembling
module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph based on our
entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is able
to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two challenging
benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying higher
efficiency in inference. We hope our model can serve as a strong baseline for

introduces a domain-specific bias, weakening the generalization performance. In
this work, we propose splitting the information into a task-related
representation and its complementary context representation. We propose an
original method, combining adversarial feature predictors and cyclic
reconstruction, to disentangle these two representations in the single-domain
supervised case. We then adapt this method to the unsupervised domain
adaptation problem, consisting of training a model capable of performing on
both a source and a target domain. In particular, our method promotes
disentanglement in the target domain, despite the absence of training labels.
This enables the isolation of task-specific information from both domains and a
projection into a common representation. The task-specific representation
allows efficient transfer of knowledge acquired from the source domain to the
target domain. In the single-domain case, we demonstrate the quality of our
representations on information retrieval tasks and the generalization benefits
induced by sharpened task-specific representations. We then validate the

the optimal liquidation problem of a single asset portfolio, held in a very

penalize the liquidation proceeds we attempt to maximize. We show the problem
can be solved exactly using Dynamic Programming (DP) in polynomial time.
However, exact resolution is only efficient for small instances. For medium
size and large instances, we introduce dedicated heuristics which provide thin
admissible solutions, hence tight lower bounds for the initial problem. We also
benchmark them against a commercial solver, such as LocalSolver [7]. We are
also interested in the continuously relaxed problem, which is non convex.
Firstly, we use continuous solutions, obtained by free solver NLopt [26] and
transform them into thin admissible solutions of the discrete problem.
Secondly, we provide, under some convexity assumptions, an upper bound for the
continuous relaxation, and hence for the initial (integer) problem. Numerical
experiments confirm the quality of proposed heuristics (lower bounds), which
often reach the optimal, or prove very tight, for small and medium size
instances, with a very fast CPU time. Our upper bound, however, is not tight.

However, prior work has presented strong empirical and theoretical evidence
demonstrating that importance weights can have little to no effect on
overparameterized neural networks. Is importance weighting truly incompatible
with the training of overparameterized neural networks? Our paper answers this
in the negative. We show that importance weighting fails not because of the
overparameterization, but instead, as a result of using exponentially-tailed
losses like the logistic or cross-entropy loss. As a remedy, we show that
polynomially-tailed losses restore the effects of importance reweighting in
correcting distribution shift in overparameterized models. We characterize the
behavior of gradient descent on importance weighted polynomially-tailed losses
with overparameterized linear models, and theoretically demonstrate the
advantage of using polynomially-tailed losses in a label shift setting.
Surprisingly, our theory shows that using weights that are obtained by
exponentiating the classical unbiased importance weights can improve
performance. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our analysis with
neural network experiments on a subpopulation shift and a label shift dataset.
When reweighted, our loss function can outperform reweighted cross-entropy by
as much as 9% in test accuracy. Our loss function also gives test accuracies
comparable to, or even exceeding, well-tuned state-of-the-art methods for
correcting distribution shifts.

to display many-body localization. Recently a slow and small growth of $S_N$
has been numerically reported, which, if holding at asymptotically long times

true localization. By numerically studying $S_N$ in the disordered isotropic
Heisenberg model we first reconfirm that, indeed, there is a small growth of
$S_N$. However, we show that such growth is fully compatible with localization.
To be specific, using a simple model that accounts for expected rare resonances
we can analytically predict several main features of numerically obtained
$S_N$: trivial initial growth at short times, a slow power-law growth at
intermediate times, and the scaling of the saturation value of $S_N$ with the
disorder strength. Because resonances crucially depend on individual disorder

  Methods: We analyzed a training set of 20 patients, each with four
sequences/weightings: T1, T1 post-contrast, T2, and T2-FLAIR. We trained the
parameters of a relatively small convolutional neural network (CNN) as follows:
First, we randomly mutated the CNN weights. We then measured the CNN training
set accuracy, using the latter as the fitness evaluation metric. The fittest
child CNNs were identified. We incorporated their mutations into the parent
CNN. This selectively mutated parent became the next generation's parent CNN.
We repeated this process for approximately 50,000 generations.
  Results: DNE achieved monotonic convergence to 100% training set accuracy.
DNE also converged monotonically to 100% testing set accuracy.
  Conclusions: DNE can achieve perfect accuracy with small training sets and
small CNNs. Particularly when combined with Deep Reinforcement Learning, DNE
may provide a path forward in the quest to make radiology AI more human-like in
its ability to learn. DNE may very well turn out to be a key component of the
much-anticipated meta-learning regime of radiology AI algorithms that can adapt
to new tasks and new image types, similar to human radiologists.

scattering in the context of astrophysical applications. It is assumed that the
two hard X-ray photons emitted from an astrophysical source are scattered on a
free electron and converted into a single soft photon of optical range. Using
QED S-matrix formalism for the derivation of a cross-section of direct double
Compton (DDC) and assuming detailed balance conditions we give an analytical
expression for the cross-section of the IDC process. It is shown that at fixed
energies of incident photons the inverse cross-section has no infra-red
divergences and its behavior is completely defined by the spectral
characteristics of the photon source itself, in particular, by the finite
interaction time of radiation with an electron. Thus, even for the direct
process, the problem of resolving infrared divergence actually refers to a real
physical source of radiation in which photons are never actually plane waves.
As a result the physical frequency profile of the scattered radiation for
direct as well as inverse double Compton processes is a function of both the
intensity and line shape of the incident photon field.

membership inference attack as a case study attack. One of the highlights of
our results is that prediction perturbation consistently achieves the lowest

objective perturbation results in lowest privacy leakage compared to other
perturbation techniques. For deep neural networks, gradient perturbation
results in lowest privacy leakage. Moreover, our results on true revealed

facial expression synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GAN). A
direct connection transfers identity, facial, and color details from input to
output while suppressing artifacts. The intermediate layers can therefore focus
on expression generation only. This leads to a light-weight US-GAN model
comprised of encoding layers, a single residual block, decoding layers, and an
ultimate skip connection from input to output. US-GAN has $3\times$ fewer
parameters than state-of-the-art models and is trained on $2$ orders of
magnitude smaller dataset. It yields $7\%$ increase in face verification score
(FVS) and $27\%$ decrease in average content distance (ACD). Based on a
randomized user-study, US-GAN outperforms the state of the art by $25\%$ in
face realism, $43\%$ in expression quality, and $58\%$ in identity

from RGB images to a number of spectral bands. However, this modeling strategy
ignores the continuous nature of spectral signature. In this paper, we propose
Neural Spectral Reconstruction (NeSR) to lift this limitation, by introducing a
novel continuous spectral representation. To this end, we embrace the concept
of implicit function and implement a parameterized embodiment with a neural
network. Specifically, we first adopt a backbone network to extract spatial
features of RGB inputs. Based on it, we devise Spectral Profile Interpolation
(SPI) module and Neural Attention Mapping (NAM) module to enrich deep features,
where the spatial-spectral correlation is involved for a better representation.
Then, we view the number of sampled spectral bands as the coordinate of
continuous implicit function, so as to learn the projection from deep features
to spectral intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the distinct
advantage of NeSR in reconstruction accuracy over baseline methods. Moreover,
NeSR extends the flexibility of spectral reconstruction by enabling an
arbitrary number of spectral bands as the target output.

neutrino masses is still not fixed. Also, the flavour structure of fermions is
yet not fully understood. We discuss all these issues, in a highly predictive,
low-scale inverse seesaw (ISS) model within the framework of $A_4$ flavour

speed-ups with factor $w$, where $w$ is the computer word size. For example,
edit distance of two strings of length $n$ can be solved in $O(n^2/w)$ time. In
a reasonable classical model of computation, one can assume $w=\Theta(\log n)$.
There are conditional lower bounds for such problems stating that speed-ups
with factor $n^\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$ would lead to breakthroughs in
complexity theory. However, these conditional lower bounds do not cover quantum
models of computing. Indeed, Boroujeni et al. (J. ACM, 2021) showed that edit
distance can be approximated within a factor $3$ in sub-quadratic time
$O(n^{1.81})$ using quantum computing. They also showed that, in their chosen
model of quantum computing, the approximation factor cannot be improved using
sub-quadractic time.
  To break through the aforementioned classical conditional lower bounds and
this latest quantum lower bound, we enrich the model of computation with a
quantum random access memory (QRAM), obtaining what we call the word QRAM
model. Under this model, we show how to convert the bit-parallelism of
quadratic time solvable problems into quantum algorithms that attain speed-ups
with factor $n$. The technique we use is simple and general enough to apply to
many bit-parallel algorithms that use Boolean logics and bit-shifts. To apply
it to edit distance, we first show that the famous $O(n^2/w)$ time bit-parallel
algorithm of Myers (J. ACM, 1999) can be adjusted to work without arithmetic +
operations. As a direct consequence of applying our technique to this variant,
we obtain linear time edit distance algorithm under the word QRAM model for

QRAM model to give more insights to the limits of the model.

equation in the real and complex domain, given that a suitable and tractable
truncation has been found. When aiming for solving these equations in the
complex domain, that is, for complex external momenta, one has to deform the
integration contour of the radial component in the complex plane of the loop
momentum expressed in hyper-spherical coordinates. This has to be done in order
to avoid poles and branch cuts in the integrand of the self-energy loop. Since
the nature of Dyson-Schwinger equations is such, that they have to be solved in

only single measurement vector (SMV) based MMSE estimation is considered in
this paper, i.e., the MMSE estimation is performed based on the received pilot
signals at each AP separately. Inspired by the decoupling principle of replica
symmetric postulated MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) non-zero components, we develop the
corresponding decoupling principle for the SMV based MMSE estimation of sparse

and analysis of the fECG from noninvasive maternal abdominal recordings are
reviewed and compared with one another in detail. The major topics of the
chapter include: 1) the electrophysiology of the fECG from the signal

conduction media and the waveform models of the fECG acquired from body surface
leads, 3) the signal acquisition requirements, 4) model-based techniques for
fECG noise and interference cancellation, including adaptive filters and
semi-blind source separation techniques, and 5) recent algorithmic advances for
fetal motion tracking and online fECG extraction from few number of channels.

However, the complexity of this approach becomes prohibitive in practice when
the sample space is large, which is usually the case in massive MIMO systems.
Our algorithm overcomes this drawback by converting the original problem into a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization problem, and solving it through a
related dynamical system via a stochastic gradient descent method. Using this
approach, we improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system by performing
joint antenna splitting and user scheduling. Additionally, numerical results

maximum shortest path distance between any pair of vertices. In this paper, we
provide upper and lower bounds on the combinatorial diameter of a random
""spherical"" polytope, which is tight to within one factor of dimension when the
number of inequalities is large compared to the dimension. More precisely, for
an $n$-dimensional polytope $P$ defined by the intersection of $m$ i.i.d.\
half-spaces whose normals are chosen uniformly from the sphere, we show that
$\operatorname{diam}(P)$ is $\Omega(n m^{\frac{1}{n-1}})$ and $O(n^2
m^{\frac{1}{n-1}} + n^5 4^n)$ with high probability when $m \geq
2^{\Omega(n)}$.
  For the upper bound, we first prove that the number of vertices in any fixed
two dimensional projection sharply concentrates around its expectation when $m$
is large, where we rely on the $\Theta(n^2 m^{\frac{1}{n-1}})$ bound on the
expectation due to Borgwardt [Math. Oper. Res., 1999]. To obtain the diameter
upper bound, we stitch these ``shadows paths'' together over a suitable net
using worst-case diameter bounds to connect vertices to the nearest shadow. For
the lower bound, we first reduce to lower bounding the diameter of the dual
polytope $P^\circ$, corresponding to a random convex hull, by showing the
relation $\operatorname{diam}(P) \geq (n-1)(\operatorname{diam}(P^\circ)-2)$.
We then prove that the shortest path between any ``nearly'' antipodal pair
vertices of $P^\circ$ has length $\Omega(m^{\frac{1}{n-1}})$.

obstacles as well as the robot's control noise are modelled as non-parametric
distributions as often the Gaussian assumptions of noise models are violated in
real-world scenarios. Under these assumptions, we formulate a robust MPC that
samples robotic controls effectively in a manner that aligns the robot to the
goal state while avoiding obstacles under the duress of such non-parametric
noise. In particular, the MPC incorporates a distribution matching cost that
effectively aligns the distribution of the current collision cone to a certain
desired distribution whose samples are collision-free. This cost is posed as a
distance function in the Hilbert Space, whose minimization typically results in
the collision cone samples becoming collision-free. We compare and show
tangible performance gain with methods that model the collision cone
distribution by linearizing the Gaussian approximations of the original
non-parametric state and obstacle distributions. We also show superior
performance with methods that pose a chance constraint formulation of the
Gaussian approximations of non-parametric noise without subjecting such
approximations to further linearizations. The performance gain is shown both in
terms of trajectory length and control costs that vindicates the efficacy of
the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
presentation of non-holonomic collision avoidance of moving obstacles in the

coordinate method (GCM) as a microscopic theory for cluster radioactivities of
heavy nuclei, which can be regarded as a fission with large mass asymmetry,
that is, a phenomenon in between fission and $\alpha$-decays.
  \noindent\textbf{Methods:} Based on the Gamow theory, we evaluate the
preformation probability of a cluster with GCM while the penetrability of the
Coulomb barrier is estimated with a potential model. To this end, we employ
Skyrme interactions and solve the one-dimensional Hill-Wheeler equation with
the mass octupole field. We also take into account the dynamical effects of the
pairing correlation using BCS wavefunctions constructed with an increased
strength of the pairing interaction.
  \noindent\textbf{Results:} We apply this scheme to the cluster decay of
$^{222}$Ra, i.e., $^{222}$Ra$\to^{14}$C+$^{208}$Pb, to show that the
experimental decay rate can be reproduced within about two order of magnitude.
We also briefly discuss the cluster radioactivities of the $^{228}$Th and

calculations reproduce the decay rates with the same order of magnitude and
within two or three order of magnitude, respectively.

promising way to describe microscopically cluster decays of heavy nuclei.

identical circularly polarised counter-propagating waves. We consider parallel
propagation along the constant magnetic field and we find that left and
right-handed modes generate via ponderomotive forces the second harmonic of
standing ion-acoustic waves. We demonstrate that parametric instabilities are
not relevant in the present problem and the secondary ion-acoustic waves
attenuate by Landau damping in the absence of any other dissipative process.
Kinetic effects are included in our model where ions are considered as
particles and electrons as a massless fluid, and hybrid simulations are used to
complement the theoretical results. Analytical expressions are obtained for the
time evolution of the different physical variables in the absence of Landau
damping. From the hybrid simulations we find that the attenuation of the
generated ion-acoustic waves follows the theoretical predictions even under the
presence of a driver Alfv\'enic pump. Due to the nonlinear induced ion-acoustic
waves the system develops density cavities and an electric field parallel to
the magnetic field. Theoretical expressions for this density and electric field

sequence, so the last decades have been characterized by the implementation of
various point process into the field of social networks,electronic medical
records and financial transactions. At the beginning, Hawkes process and its
variants which can simulate simultaneously the self-triggering and mutual
triggering patterns between different events in complex sequences in a clear
and quantitative way are more popular.Later on, with the advances of neural
network, neural Hawkes process has been proposed one after another, and
gradually become a research hotspot. The proposal of the transformer Hawkes
process (THP) has gained a huge performance improvement, so a new upsurge of
the neural Hawkes process based on transformer is set off. However, THP does
not make full use of the information of occurrence time and type of event in
the asynchronous event sequence. It simply adds the encoding of event type
conversion and the location encoding of time conversion to the source encoding.
At the same time, the learner built from a single transformer will result in an
inescapable learning bias. In order to mitigate these problems, we propose a
tri-transformer Hawkes process (Tri-THP) model, in which the event and time
information are added to the dot-product attention as auxiliary information to
form a new multihead attention. The effectiveness of the Tri-THP is proved by a
series of well-designed experiments on both real world and synthetic data.

the challenge, numerous defense strategies, including reactive and proactive
ones, have been proposed for robustness improvement. From the perspective of
image feature space, some of them cannot reach satisfying results due to the
shift of features. Besides, features learned by models are not directly related
to classification results. Different from them, We consider defense method
essentially from model inside and investigated the neuron behaviors before and
after attacks. We observed that attacks mislead the model by dramatically
changing the neurons that contribute most and least to the correct label.
Motivated by it, we introduce the concept of neuron influence and further
divide neurons into front, middle and tail part. Based on it, we propose
neuron-level inverse perturbation(NIP), the first neuron-level reactive defense
method against adversarial attacks. By strengthening front neurons and
weakening those in the tail part, NIP can eliminate nearly all adversarial
perturbations while still maintaining high benign accuracy. Besides, it can
cope with different sizes of perturbations via adaptivity, especially larger
ones. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three datasets and six models show
that NIP outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines against eleven adversarial

functors acting on the K-theory/derived category of coherent sheaves on
$n$-step partial flag varieties. Those operators can be viewed as a
generalization of the Demazure operators for the full flag variety, and the two
families of idempotent operators generate respectively two algebras that are
similar to the $q=0$ Hecke algebra. The main idea comes from the interpretation
of the Demazure operators in terms of elements in the shifted $q=0$ affine
algebra. As a main result, we show that a categorical action of the shifted
$q=0$ affine algebra naturally induces actions of two variants of the $q=0$
Hecke algebra on each weight category. Finally, we calculate the action of
those operators on the basis given by the Kapranov exceptional collection.

benefited from abundant pre-trained models. However, the backdoored pre-trained
models can pose a significant trojan threat to the deployment of downstream
DNNs. Existing DNN testing methods are mainly designed to find incorrect corner
case behaviors in adversarial settings but fail to discover the backdoors
crafted by strong trojan attacks. Observing the trojan network behaviors shows
that they are not just reflected by a single compromised neuron as proposed by
previous work but attributed to the critical neural paths in the activation
intensity and frequency of multiple neurons. This work formulates the DNN
backdoor testing and proposes the CatchBackdoor framework. Via differential
fuzzing of critical neurons from a small number of benign examples, we identify
the trojan paths and particularly the critical ones, and generate backdoor
testing examples by simulating the critical neurons in the identified paths.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CatchBackdoor, with higher
detection performance than existing methods. CatchBackdoor works better on
detecting backdoors by stealthy blending and adaptive attacks, which existing
methods fail to detect. Moreover, our experiments show that CatchBackdoor may
reveal the potential backdoors of models in Model Zoo.

centers-of-mass of two polymers with reversible bonds. We investigate the
influence of the topology of the unbonded precursor (linear or ring) and the
specific sequence of the reactive groups (from purely random to periodic),
establishing that both have a strong impact on the effective potential. When
the reactive sites of both polymers are chemically orthogonal so that only
intramolecular bonds are possible, the interactions become more repulsive the
closer to periodic the sequence is. The opposite effect is found if both
polymers have the same type of reactive sites and intermolecular bonds can be
formed. We test the validity of the effective potentials in solution, from high
dilution to far above the overlap concentration, by comparing simulations of
the effective fluid with those of the real all-monomer system. Very good
agreement is found for the reversible linear polymers, indicating that unlike
in their non-bonding counterparts many-body effects are minor even far above
the overlap concentration. The agreement for the reversible rings is less
satisfactory, and at high concentration the real system does not show the
clustering behavior predicted by the effective potential. Results similar to
the former ones are found for the partial self-correlations in ring/linear
mixtures. Finally, we investigate the possibility of creating a gel of two
interpenetrated reversible networks. For this purpose we simulate a 50/50
two-component mixture of reversible polymers with orthogonal chemistry for the
reactive sites, so that intermolecular bonds are only formed between polymers
of the same component. As predicted by both the theoretical phase diagram and
the simulations of the effective fluid, the two networks in the all-monomer
mixture do not interpenetrate and phase separation (demixing) is observed
instead.

important differences emerge between seasons. During winter, large wavenumbers

planetary and synoptic-scale transport extremes virtually never co-occur. In
summer, extremes are associated with higher wavenumbers ($k=4-6$), identified

recent results on exceptionally strong and persistent co-occurring summertime

the same class of relation without distinguishing the different characteristics

sufficiently model node multi-relational information in BMHG, we adopt a newly

the channel features to enhance the consistency of different feature maps.
Subsequently, we employ an atrous spatial pyramid pooling module (comprising of
atrous convolutions in series, with progressive rates of dilation) to integrate
the spatial context information. This helps better distinguish between potholes
and undamaged road areas. Finally, the feature maps in the adjacent layers are
fused using our proposed multi-scale feature fusion module. This further
reduces the semantic gap between different feature channel layers. Extensive
experiments were carried out on the Pothole-600 dataset to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The quantitative comparisons suggest that
our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on both RGB images
and transformed disparity images, outperforming three SoTA single-modal

propose a representation facilitating the extraction of information, used in

to create the concept dictionary, then the ontology, enriched as the document
is scanned and understood by the system. Once the relevant terms have been
identified, the work focuses on identifying and representing the requirements,
separating the textual writing from the information given in the tables. The
automatic processing of requirements involves the extraction of sentences
containing terms identified as relevant to a requirement. The identified
requirement is then indexed and stored in a representation that can be used for

domains to federate in provisioning NFV network services. Admission control is
fundamental in selecting the appropriate deployment domain to maximize average

This paper analyzes a general federation contract model for service delegation
in various ways. First, under the assumption of known system dynamics, we
obtain the theoretically optimal performance bound by formulating the admission
control problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and
solving it through dynamic programming. Second, we apply reinforcement learning
to practically tackle the problem when the arrival and departure rates are not
known. As Q-learning maximizes the discounted rewards, we prove it is not an
efficient solution due to its sensitivity to the discount factor. Then, we
propose the average reward reinforcement learning approach (R-Learning) to find
the policy that directly maximizes the average profit. Finally, we evaluate
different solutions through extensive simulations and experimentally using the
5Growth platform. Results confirm that the proposed R-Learning solution always
outperforms Q-Learning and the greedy policies. Furthermore, while there is at
most 9% optimality gap in the ideal simulation environment, it competes with
the MDP solution in the experimental assessment.

reduce the memory consumption in prefix-alignment-based OCC techniques along

first proposed approach bounds the number of maximum states that constitute a
prefix-alignment to be retained by any case in memory. The second proposed
approach bounds the number of cases that are allowed to retain more than a
single state, referred to as multi-state cases. Building on top of the two
proposed approaches, our third approach further bounds the number of maximum
states that the multi-state cases can retain. All these approaches forget the
states in excess to their defined limits and retain a meaningful summary of
them. Computing prefix-alignments in the future is then resumed for such cases
from the current position contained in the summary. We highlight the
superiority of all proposed approaches compared to a state of the art

the situation coverage-based generation tells us a lot more about the
weaknesses of the autonomous driving algorithm of our ego AV, especially in
edge-cases. Our code is publicly available online, anyone can use our SitCov
AV-testing framework and use it or build further on top of it. This paper aims
to contribute to the domain of V&V and development of AVs, not only from a
theoretical point of view, but also from the viewpoint of an open-source

  Networks via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.IT cs.SY eess.SY math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the scarcity in the wireless spectrum and limited energy resources
especially in mobile applications, efficient resource allocation strategies are
critical in wireless networks. Motivated by the recent advances in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL), we address multi-agent DRL-based joint dynamic
channel access and power control in a wireless interference network. We first
propose a multi-agent DRL algorithm with centralized training (DRL-CT) to
tackle the joint resource allocation problem. In this case, the training is
performed at the central unit (CU) and after training, the users make
autonomous decisions on their transmission strategies with only local
information. We demonstrate that with limited information exchange and faster
convergence, DRL-CT algorithm can achieve 90% of the performance achieved by
the combination of weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm for
power control and exhaustive search for dynamic channel access. In the second
part of this paper, we consider distributed multi-agent DRL scenario in which
each user conducts its own training and makes its decisions individually,
acting as a DRL agent. Finally, as a compromise between centralized and fully
distributed scenarios, we consider federated DRL (FDRL) to approach the
performance of DRL-CT with the use of a central unit in training while limiting
the information exchange and preserving privacy of the users in the wireless
system. Via simulation results, we show that proposed learning frameworks lead
to efficient adaptive channel access and power control policies in dynamic
environments.

usually constructed as a linear combinations of shock components and

property of such models, whereby the shocks may over- or under-contribute to
some observations. The literature has also introduced corrections for this. The
present paper discusses 'auto-balanced' models, in which all shock and

proportionate contributions are constant from one observation to another. The
conditions for auto-balance are found to be simple and applicable to a wide
range of model structures. Numerical illustrations are given.

mechanism and the noise floor in precision timing. We study total intensity and
polarimetry properties of three bright millisecond pulsars - PSRs J1022+1001,
J1713+0747, and B1855+09 - that have detectable single pulses at multiple
frequencies. We report for the first time the detection of single pulses from
PSRs J1022+1001 and J1713+0747 at 4.5 GHz. In addition, for those two pulsars
the fraction of linear polarization in the average profile is significantly
reduced at 4.5 GHz, compared to 1.38 GHz, which could support the expected
deviation from a dipolar field closer to the pulsar surface. There is a hint of
orthogonal modes in the single pulses of PSR J1713+0747. More sensitive
multi-frequency observations may be useful to confirm these findings. The
jitter noise contributions at 1.38 GHz, scaled to one hour, for PSRs
J1022+1001, J1713+0747 and B1855+09 are ~135 ns, ~45 ns, and ~60 ns
respectively and are consistent with previous studies. We also show that
selective bright-pulse timing of PSR J1022+1001 yields improved
root-mean-square residuals of ~22 $\mu$s, which is a factor of ~3 better than
timing using single pulses alone.

  Distillation","Accepted at AAAI 22, 13 pages",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its feasibility in
solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). The learning-to-rank
techniques have been studied in the field of information retrieval. While
several COPs can be formulated as the prioritization of input items, as is
common in the information retrieval, it has not been fully explored how the
learning-to-rank techniques can be incorporated into deep RL for COPs. In this
paper, we present the learning-to-rank distillation-based COP framework, where
a high-performance ranking policy obtained by RL for a COP can be distilled
into a non-iterative, simple model, thereby achieving a low-latency COP solver.
Specifically, we employ the approximated ranking distillation to render a
score-based ranking model learnable via gradient descent. Furthermore, we use
the efficient sequence sampling to improve the inference performance with a
limited delay. With the framework, we demonstrate that a distilled model not
only achieves comparable performance to its respective, high-performance RL,
but also provides several times faster inferences. We evaluate the framework
with several COPs such as priority-based task scheduling and multidimensional
knapsack, demonstrating the benefits of the framework in terms of inference
latency and performance.

steam is a pressing concern that requires further research before their
implementation in gas turbine engines can be realized. In this work,
free-standing plasma sprayed Yb2Si2O7 coatings were exposed to flowing steam at
1350 {\deg}C and 1400 {\deg}C for 96 h. Three samples were investigated, one
coating with a low porosity level (< 3 %) and 1 wt.% Al2O3 representing
traditional EBCs; and two coatings with higher porosity levels (~20 %)
representing abradable EBCs. Phase composition and microstructural evolution
were studied in order to reveal the underlying mechanism for the interaction
between high temperature steam and ytterbium disilicate. The results show
depletion of Yb2SiO5 near the surface and formation of ytterbium garnet
(Yb3Al5O12) on top of all three coatings due to the reaction with gaseous
Al-containing impurities coming from the alumina furnace tubes. The 1 wt.%
Al2O3 added to the EBC sample exacerbated the formation of garnet at 1400
{\deg}C compared to the abradable samples, which presented lower quantities of
garnet. Additionally, inter-splat boundaries were visible after exposure,
indicating preferential ingress of gaseous Al-containing impurities through the
splat boundaries

environment via meta-reinforcement learning. Spectrum is a scarce resource in
wireless communications, especially with the dramatic increase in the number of
devices in networks. Recently, inspired by the success of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), extensive studies have been conducted in addressing wireless
resource allocation problems via DRL. However, training DRL algorithms usually
requires a massive amount of data collected from the environment for each
specific task and the well-trained model may fail if there is a small variation
in the environment. In this work, in order to address these challenges, we
propose a meta-DRL framework that incorporates the method of Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning (MAML). In the proposed framework, we train a common
initialization for similar channel selection tasks. From the initialization, we
show that only a few gradient descents are required for adapting to different
tasks drawn from the same distribution. We demonstrate the performance
improvements via simulation results.

embodied cognitive systems (otherwise known as minds) in a very wide variety of
chimeric architectures combining evolved and designed material and software.
These advances are disrupting familiar concepts in the philosophy of mind, and
require new ways of thinking about and comparing truly diverse intelligences,
whose composition and origin are not like any of the available natural model
species. In this Perspective, I introduce TAME - Technological Approach to Mind
Everywhere - a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in
unconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a non-binary (continuous),
empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. When applied to
regenerating/developmental systems, TAME suggests a perspective on
morphogenesis as an example of basal cognition. The deep symmetry between
problem-solving in anatomical, physiological, transcriptional, and 3D
(traditional behavioral) spaces drives specific hypotheses by which cognitive
capacities can scale during evolution. An important medium exploited by
evolution for joining active subunits into greater agents is developmental
bioelectricity, implemented by pre-neural use of ion channels and gap junctions
to scale cell-level feedback loops into anatomical homeostasis. This
architecture of multi-scale competency of biological systems has important
implications for plasticity of bodies and minds, greatly potentiating
evolvability. Considering classical and recent data from the perspectives of
computational science, evolutionary biology, and basal cognition, reveals a
rich research program with many implications for cognitive science,
evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, and artificial intelligence.
