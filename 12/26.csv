linear demand model: a seller can dynamically adjust the price of a product
over a horizon of $T$ time periods, and at each time period $t$, the demand of
the product is jointly determined by the price and an observable covariate
vector $x_t\in\mathbb{R}^d$ through an unknown generalized linear model. Most
of the existing literature assumes the covariate vectors $x_t$'s are
independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.); the few papers that relax
this assumption either sacrifice model generality or yield sub-optimal regret
bounds. In this paper we show that a simple pricing algorithm has an
$O(d\sqrt{T}\log T)$ regret upper bound without assuming any statistical
structure on the covariates $x_t$ (which can even be arbitrarily chosen). The
upper bound on the regret matches the lower bound (even under the i.i.d.
assumption) up to logarithmic factors. Our paper thus shows that (i) the i.i.d.
assumption is not necessary for obtaining low regret, and (ii) the regret bound
can be independent of the (inverse) minimum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix
of the $x_t$'s, a quantity present in previous bounds. Furthermore, we discuss
a condition under which a better regret is achievable and how a Thompson
sampling algorithm can be applied to give an efficient computation of the
prices.

the FRSD iterate sequence converges with a linear rate to the optimal consensus

enjoys linear convergence without employing a gradient tracking (GT) technique
explicitly, rather it implements GT implicitly with the use of a novel momentum
term, which leads to a significant reduction in communication and storage
overhead for each node when FRSD is implemented for solving high-dimensional
problems over small-to-medium scale networks. In the numerical tests, we
compare FRSD with other state-of-the-art methods, which use row-stochastic

interacting matter, focusing on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).
The relative production of strange hadrons with respect to non-strange hadrons
in heavy-ion collisions was historically considered as one of the signatures of
QGP formation. However, the latest results in proton-proton (pp) and
proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions have revealed an increasing trend in the yield
ratio of strange hadrons to pions with the charged-particle multiplicity in the
event, showing a smooth evolution across different collision systems and
energies.
  We present the new studies which are performed with the aim of better
understanding the production mechanisms for strange particles and hence the
strangeness enhancement phenomenon in small collision systems. In one of the
recent studies, the very forward energy transported by beam remnants
(spectators) and detected by the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC) is used to
classify events. The contribution of the effective energy and the particle
multiplicity on strangeness production is studied using a multi-differential
approach in order to disentangle initial and final state effects. In the second
study, the origin of strangeness enhancement with multiplicity in pp has been
further investigated by separating the contribution of soft and hard processes,
such as jets, to strange hadron production. Techniques involving full jet
reconstruction or two-particle correlations have been exploited. The results
indicate that the increased relative strangeness production emerges from the
growth of the underlying event, being disconnected from initial state
properties, and suggest that soft (out-of-jets) processes are the dominant
contribution to strange hadron production.

parameter used in a previous study's score function, while still yielding
accurate and efficient model calibration using even fewer scans on a sample set

also conduct a robust analysis of the calibration accuracy and certainty, using
both error and uncertainty metrics. Unlike the error analysis of the previous

deciding when the algorithm can be terminated|provides a more realistic option
for clinical decision-making, since it does not rely on data that will be

intelligent surface (RIS) in a multiuser environment where multiple
single-antenna transceivers communicate simultaneously in a shared spectrum.
From a theoretical perspective, we show that when the channels between the RIS
and the transceivers have line-of-sight and the direct paths are blocked, it is
possible to adjust the phases of the RIS elements to null out all the
interference completely and to achieve the maximum $K$ degrees-of-freedom (DoF)
in the overall $K$-user interference channel, provided that the number of RIS
elements exceeds some finite value that depends on $K$. Algorithmically, for
any fixed channel realization we formulate the interference nulling problem as
a feasibility problem, and propose an alternating projection algorithm to
efficiently solve the resulting nonconvex problem with local convergence
guarantee. Numerical results show that the proposed alternating projection
algorithm can null all the interference if the number of RIS elements is only
slightly larger than a threshold of $2K(K-1)$. For the practical sum-rate
maximization objective, this paper proposes to use the zero-forcing solution
obtained from alternating projection as an initial point for subsequent
Riemannian conjugate gradient optimization and shows that it has a significant
performance advantage over random initializations. For the objective of
maximizing the minimum rate, this paper proposes a subgradient projection
method which is capable of achieving excellent performance at low complexity.

requires gap closing, whereas there are also unconventional cases without need
of gap closing. Although traditionally TPTs lie in many-body systems in
condensed matter, both cases of TPTs may find analogs in few-body systems.
Indeed, the ground-state node number provides a topological classification for
single-qubit systems. While the no-node theorem of spinless systems is shown to
also restrict the fundamental quantum Rabi model in light-matter interactions,
it is demonstrated that the limitation of the no-node theorem can be broken not
only in a small counter-rotating term (CRT) but also in the large-CRT regime,
which striates a rich phase diagram with different TPTs. While these
transitions are mostly accompanied with gap closing and parity reversal, a
hidden node-phase transition is revealed that has neither gap closing nor
parity change, which turns out to be an analog of the unconventional TPT in
condensed matter. A hysteresis sign for the unconventional TPT is unveiled via
the transition from amplitude squeezing to phase squeezing in the gapped phase.
The imprints in the Wigner function are also addressed. The clarified
mechanisms provide some special insights for the subtle role of the CRT.

However, existing attack strategies rely on the knowledge of either the GNN

necessary? For example, a graph may be used for multiple downstream tasks
unknown to a practical attacker. It is thus important to test the vulnerability
of GNNs to adversarial perturbations in a model and task agnostic setting. In

and machine learning, this work considers the computational aspects of
over-parametrized matrix factorization. In this context, the optimization
landscape may contain spurious stationary points (SSPs), which are proved to be
full-rank matrices. The presence of these SSPs means that it is impossible to
hope for any global guarantees in over-parametrized matrix factorization. For
example, when initialized at an SSP, the gradient flow will be trapped there
forever. Nevertheless, despite these SSPs, we establish in this work that the
gradient flow of the corresponding merit function converges to a global
minimizer, provided that its initialization is rank-deficient and sufficiently
close to the feasible set of the optimization problem. We numerically observe
that a heuristic discretization of the proposed gradient flow, inspired by
primal-dual algorithms, is successful when initialized randomly. Our result is
in sharp contrast with the local refinement methods which require an
initialization close to the optimal set of the optimization problem. More
specifically, we successfully avoid the traps set by the SSPs because the
gradient flow remains rank-deficient at all times, and not because there are no
SSPs nearby. The latter is the case for the local refinement methods. Moreover,
the widely-used restricted isometry property plays no role in our main result.

prevalence is increasing, especially in developing countries. Objective: In the
present study, we employed gene expression profiles from the GSE163209 data set
in the GEO database to identify potential molecular and genetic markers in BC
patients. Methods: The data set comprised 217 samples, with 113 stage Ta tumor
tissue samples and 104 stage T1 tumor tissue samples. The top 766 genes were
chosen. P.value<0.0001 and |logFC|=1 was used to change the cutoff criteria for
defining DEGs. Moreover, the MCODE plugin and cytoHubba plugin were employed to
produce a module and detect 20 hub genes in these DEGs. We used GO and KEGG
pathway enrichment analyses to get a better understanding of these DEGs.
Results: The KEGG pathway enrichment results indicated that the top genes were
mainly involved: Systemic lupus erythematosus, Alcoholism, and Viral
carcinogenesis. SLE activation in the renal glomeruli could explain the
connection between this disease's route and bladder cancer, and according to
our results and previous researches, heavy alcohol intake can increase the risk
of BC in males and particular populations. Conclusion: According to our hub
genes, we can consider CDK1 and NDC80 as bladder cancer biomarkers. Not much
research has been done on the effect of this gene on bladder cancer.

The other required parameters, including the light curve solutions and the
orbital period were derived from previous research. For some relationships, we
added 86 systems from another study with an orbital period of less than 0.6
days to our sample, allowing us to increase the number of systems to 204.
Therefore, the mass (M) values of each component along with all the other
absolute parameters were recalculated for these contact systems. We used the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach in order to gain the new orbital
period-mass relations (P-M) per component, and added the temperature (T) to the
process to acquire the new orbital period-temperature (P-T1) relation. We
presented the orbital period behavior in terms of log(g) by new relations for
each component. We have also obtained a model between the orbital period, the

area for quantum algorithms. We consider Schr\""odinger's equation in the
semi-classical regime. Here the solutions exhibit strong multiple-scale
behavior due to a small parameter $\hbar$, in the sense that the dynamics of
the quantum states and the induced observables can occur on different spatial
and temporal scales. Such a Schr\""odinger equation finds many applications,
including in Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics and Ehrenfest dynamics. This
paper considers quantum analogues of pseudo-spectral (PS) methods on classical
computers. Estimates on the gate counts in terms of $\hbar$ and the precision
$\varepsilon$ are obtained. It is found that the number of required qubits,
$m$, scales only logarithmically with respect to $\hbar$. When the solution has
bounded derivatives up to order $\ell$, the symmetric Trotting method has gate
complexity $\mathcal{O}\Big({ (\varepsilon \hbar)^{-\frac12}

operators in the pseudo-spectral methods can be implemented with
$\mathrm{poly}(m)$ operations. When physical observables are the desired
outcomes, however, the step size in the time integration can be chosen
independently of $\hbar$. The gate complexity in this case is reduced to
$\mathcal{O}\Big({\varepsilon^{-\frac12} \mathrm{polylog}(
\varepsilon^{-\frac3{2\ell}} \hbar^{-1} )}\Big),$ with $\ell$ again indicating
the smoothness of the solution.

RNmatrix is a Nmatrix together with a {\em subset} of valuations over it, from
which the consequence relation is defined. Within this semantical framework we
have characterized each paraconsistent logic $C_{n}$ in the hierarchy of da
Costa by means of a $(n+2)$-valued RNmatrix, which also provides a relatively
simple decision procedure for each calculus (recalling that $C_1$ cannot be
characterized by a single finite Nmatrix). In this paper we extend such
RNmatrices for $C_{n}$ by means of what we call {\em restricted
swap-structures} over arbitrary Boolean algebras, obtaining so a class of
non-deterministic semantical structures which characterizes da Costa's systems.
We give a brief algebraic and combinatorial description of the elements of the
underlying RNmatrices. Finally, by presenting a notion of category of
RNmatrices, we show that the category of RNmatrices for $C_{n}$ is in fact
isomorphic to the category of non-trivial Boolean algebras.

combinations of parallel mini-bioreactors, liquid handling robots and automated
workflows for data handling and model based operation. For successfully
monitoring cultivation conditions and improving the overall process quality by
model-based approaches, a proper model identification is crucial. However, the
quality and amount of measurements makes this task challenging considering the
complexity of the bio-processes. TheDissolved Oxygen Tension is often the only
measurement which is available online, and therefore, a good understanding of
the errors in this signal is important for performing a robust estimation.Some
of the expected errors will provoke uncertainties in the time-domain of the
measurement, and in those cases, the common Weighted Least Squares estimation
procedure can fail providing good results. Moreover, these errors will have
even a larger effect in the fed-batch phase where bolus feeding is applied, as
this generates fast dynamic responses in the signal. In the present work, an
insilico study of the performance of Weighted Least Squares estimator is
analysed when the expected time-uncertainties are present in the oxygen signal.
As an alternative, a loss based on the Dynamic Time Warping measure is
proposed. The results show how this latter procedure outperforms the former
reconstructing the oxygen signal, and in addition, returns less biased
parameter estimates.

can treat the unit disk as a hyperbolic plane in the Poincare disk model. From
this perspective each arc $L$ of the selected set determines a hyperbolic
half-plane bounded by the geodesic curve $I$ joining endpoints of the arc $L$.
Remove from the unit disk all these hyperbolic half-planes. The remaining
domain is simply connected and contains the origin. Now map this domain
conformally onto the unit disk so that the origin stays fixed. After this map,
the boundaries of the hyperbolic half-planes appear as disjoint arcs on the

  Systems",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The accuracy of binary classification systems is defined as the proportion of
correct predictions - both positive and negative - made by a classification
model or computational algorithm. A value between 0 (no accuracy) and 1
(perfect accuracy), the accuracy of a classification model is dependent on
several factors, notably: the classification rule or algorithm used, the
intrinsic characteristics of the tool used to do the classification, and the
relative frequency of the elements being classified. Several accuracy metrics
exist, each with its own advantages in different classification scenarios. In
this manuscript, we show that relative to a perfect accuracy of 1, the positive
prevalence threshold ($\phi_e$), a critical point of maximum curvature in the
precision-prevalence curve, bounds the $F{_{\beta}}$ score between 1 and
1.8/1.5/1.2 for $\beta$ values of 0.5/1.0/2.0, respectively; the $F_1$ score
between 1 and 1.5, and the Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FM) between 1 and $\sqrt{2}
\approx 1.414$. We likewise describe a novel $negative$ prevalence threshold
($\phi_n$), the level of sharpest curvature for the negative predictive
value-prevalence curve, such that $\phi_n$ $>$ $\phi_e$. The area between both
these thresholds bounds the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) between
$\sqrt{2}/2$ and $\sqrt{2}$. Conversely, the ratio of the maximum possible
accuracy to that at any point below the prevalence threshold, $\phi_e$, goes to
infinity with decreasing prevalence. Though applications are numerous, the
ideas herein discussed may be used in computational complexity theory,
artificial intelligence, and medical screening, amongst others. Where
computational time is a limiting resource, attaining the prevalence threshold
in binary classification systems may be sufficient to yield levels of accuracy
comparable to that under maximum prevalence.

The standard deep learning-assisted ghost imaging methods use the network to
recognize the reconstructed objects or imaging algorithms. In contrast, this
innovative application optimizes the illuminating speckle patterns via
Speckle-Net with specific sampling ratios. Our method, therefore, outperforms
the other techniques for ghost imaging, particularly its ability to retrieve
high-quality images with extremely low sampling ratios. It opens a new route
towards nontrivial speckle generation by referring to a standard loss function

great potential for applications in the fields of dynamic speckle illumination

techniques to estimate treatment effects with sufficient precision to inform
business decisions. Trigger-dilute analysis is often used in these situations,
and reduces the sampling variance of overall intent-to-treat (ITT) effects by
an order of magnitude equal to the inverse of the triggering rate; for example,
a triggering rate of $5\%$ corresponds to roughly a $20x$ reduction in
variance. To apply trigger-dilute analysis, one needs to know experimental
subjects' triggering counterfactual statuses, i.e., the counterfactual behavior
of subjects under both treatment and control conditions. In this paper, we
propose an unbiased ITT estimator with reduced variance applicable for
experiments where the triggering counterfactual status is only observed in the
treatment group. Our method is based on the efficiency augmentation idea of
CUPED and draws upon identification frameworks from the principal
stratification and instrumental variables literature. The unbiasedness of our
estimation approach relies on a testable assumption that the augmentation term
used for covariate adjustment equals zero in expectation. Unlike traditional
covariate adjustment or principal score modeling approaches, our estimator can
incorporate both pre-experiment and in-experiment observations. We demonstrate
through a real-world experiment and simulations that our estimator can remain
unbiased and achieve precision improvements as large as if triggering status
were fully observed, and in some cases can even outperform trigger-dilute
analysis.

past several years, Beacon services have emerged to broaden accessibility to
such data. These services enable users to query for the presence of a
particular minor allele in a private dataset, information that can help care
providers determine if genomic variation is spurious or has some known clinical

approaches for mitigating this vulnerability have been proposed, but they are
limited in that they 1) typically rely on heuristics and 2) offer probabilistic
privacy guarantees, but neglect utility. In this paper, we present a novel
algorithmic framework to ensure privacy in a Beacon service setting with a
minimal number of query response flips (e.g., changing a positive response to a

setting has been the primary focus in prior literature, whereas real Beacons
allow sequential queries, motivating the latter investigation. We present

is whether the nucleon direct Urca (DU) process is open. The DU process is
forbidden if the nucleon symmetry energy is significantly low. Hence, another
fast cooling process is required in such an EOS. As the candidate to solve this
problem, we consider the pion condensation. We show that the
low-symmetry-energy model can account for most cooling observations including
cold NSs, with strong neutron superfluidity. Simultaneously, it holds the
$2~M_{\odot}$ observations even if the pion condensation core exists. Thus, we
propose the possibility of pion condensation, as an exotic state to solve the

outputs of that layer so that the ""non-attention"" information has participated
in any attention propagation. The formed residual self-attention network
addresses two critical issues: (1) stop the self-attention networks from
degenerating to rank-1 to the maximized degree; and (2) further diversify the
path distribution of parameter update so that easier attention learning is
expected. Miti-DETR significantly enhances the average detection precision and
convergence speed towards existing DETR-based models on the challenging COCO

Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction may be obtained in families when the initial
data are varied. More precisely, for the Kadison transitivity theorem, we prove
that for any nonzero irreducible representation $(\mathcal{H}, \pi)$ of a
$C^*$-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a continuous
function $A:X \rightarrow \mathfrak{A}$ such that $\pi(A(\mathbf{x},

of pairs of $n$-tuples $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \in \mathcal{H}^n \times
\mathcal{H}^n$ such that the components of $\mathbf{x}$ are linearly
independent. Versions of this result where $A$ maps into the self-adjoint or
unitary elements of $\mathfrak{A}$ are also presented. Regarding the
Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we prove that given a topological
$C^*$-algebra fiber bundle $p:\mathfrak{A} \rightarrow Y$, one may construct a
topological fiber bundle $\mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A}) \rightarrow Y$ whose fiber
over $y \in Y$ is the space of pure states of $\mathfrak{A}_y$ (with the norm
topology), as well as bundles $\mathscr{H} \rightarrow
\mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A})$ and $\mathscr{N} \rightarrow
\mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A})$ whose fibers $\mathscr{H}_\omega$ and
$\mathscr{N}_\omega$ over $\omega \in \mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A})$ are the GNS
Hilbert space and closed left ideal, respectively, corresponding to $\omega$.
When $p:\mathfrak{A} \rightarrow Y$ is a smooth fiber bundle, we show that
$\mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A}) \rightarrow Y$ and $\mathscr{H}\rightarrow
\mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A})$ are also smooth fiber bundles; this involves proving
that the group of $*$-automorphisms of a $C^*$-algebra is a Banach-Lie group.
In service of these results, we review the geometry of the topology and pure
state space. A simple non-interacting quantum spin system is provided as an
example.

However, the high training cost hinders its efficiency since we need a
sufficient number of base models and each one in the ensemble has to be
separately trained. Lots of methods are proposed to tackle this problem, and
most of them are based on the feature that a pre-trained network can transfer
its knowledge to the next base model and then accelerate the training process.
However, these methods suffer a severe problem that all of them transfer
knowledge without selection and thus lead to low diversity. As the effect of
ensemble learning is more pronounced if ensemble members are accurate and
diverse, we propose a method named Efficient Diversity-Driven Ensemble (EDDE)
to address both the diversity and the efficiency of an ensemble. To accelerate
the training process, we propose a novel knowledge transfer method which can
selectively transfer the previous generic knowledge. To enhance diversity, we
first propose a new diversity measure, then use it to define a diversity-driven
loss function for optimization. At last, we adopt a Boosting-based framework to
combine the above operations, such a method can also further improve diversity.
We evaluate EDDE on Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks. Compared with other well-known ensemble methods, EDDE can get highest
ensemble accuracy with the lowest training cost, which means it is efficient in
the ensemble of neural networks.

The results are compared with those calculated with the cranking formulae. The
inertial masses based on the ASCC method reproduce the exact total nuclear mass
for the translational motion as well as the exact reduced masses as the

datasets are no exception. Reannotating the entire dataset is one probable
solution however it is not always viable due to time and budget constraints.
This paper addresses the problem of efficient reannotation of a large noisy
dataset for the RC. Our goal is to catch more annotation errors in the dataset
while reannotating fewer instances. Existing work on RC dataset reannotation
lacks the flexibility about how much data to reannotate. We introduce the
concept of a reannotation budget to overcome this limitation. The immediate
follow-up problem is: Given a specific reannotation budget, which subset of the
data should we reannotate? To address this problem, we present two strategies
to selectively reannotate RC datasets. Our strategies utilize the taxonomic
hierarchy of relation labels. The intuition of our work is to rely on the graph
distance between actual and predicted relation labels in the label hierarchy
graph. We evaluate our reannotation strategies on the well-known TACRED
dataset. We design our experiments to answer three specific research questions.
First, does our strategy select novel candidates for reannotation? Second, for
a given reannotation budget is our reannotation strategy more efficient at
catching annotation errors? Third, what is the impact of data reannotation on
RC model performance measurement? Experimental results show that our both
reannotation strategies are novel and efficient. Our analysis indicates that
the current reported performance of RC models on noisy TACRED data is inflated.

This is because their indexes can incur multiple network round-trips due to

address this issue, we develop a new statistical index (called IoU Sketch). For
lookup, IoU Sketch makes multiple asynchronous network requests in parallel.
While IoU Sketch may fetch more bytes than existing indexes, it significantly
reduces the index lookup time because parallel requests do not block each
other. Based on IoU Sketch, we build an end-to-end search engine, called
Airphant; we describe how Airphant builds, optimizes, and manages IoU Sketch;

the accuracy of quantum mechanical density functional theory, at a cost only
moderately higher than that of empirical force fields. However, the majority of
these models lack explicit long-range interactions and fail to describe
properties that derive from the Coulombic tail of the forces. To overcome this
limitation we extend the DP model by approximating the long-range electrostatic
interaction between ions (nuclei+core electrons) and valence electrons with
that of distributions of spherical Gaussian charges located at ionic and
electronic sites. The latter are rigorously defined in terms of the centers of
the maximally localized Wannier distributions, whose dependence on the local
atomic environment is modeled accurately by a deep neural network. In the deep
potential long-range (DPLR) model, the electrostatic energy of the Gaussian
charge system is added to short-range interactions that are represented as in
the standard DP model. The resulting potential energy surface is smooth and
possesses analytical forces and virial. Missing effects in the standard DP
scheme are recovered, improving on accuracy and predictive power. By including
long-range electrostatics, DPLR correctly extrapolates to large systems the
potential energy surface learned from quantum mechanical calculations on
smaller systems. We illustrate the approach with three examples, the potential
energy profile of the water dimer, the free energy of interaction of a water

addresses the offline continuous handwritten text recognition (HTR) problem,
consisting of developing algorithms and models capable of transcribing the text
present in an image without the need for the text to be segmented into
characters. For this purpose, we have proposed a new recognition model based on
integrating two types of deep learning architectures: convolutional neural
networks (CNN) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, respectively. The
convolutional component of the model is oriented to identify relevant features
present in characters, and the seq2seq component builds the transcription of
the text by modeling the sequential nature of the text. For the design of this
new model, an extensive analysis of the capabilities of different convolutional
architectures in the simplified problem of isolated character recognition has
been carried out in order to identify the most suitable ones to be integrated
into the continuous model. Additionally, extensive experimentation of the
proposed model for the continuous problem has been carried out to determine its
robustness to changes in parameterization. The generalization capacity of the
model has also been validated by evaluating it on three handwritten text

Osborne in Spanish, respectively. The new proposed model provides competitive
results with those obtained with other well-established methodologies.

from a nonlocal cyclotron orbit via the electron tunneling between the top and
bottom Fermi-arc surface states. Here, untwinned and high crystalline Weyl
metal SrRuO$_3$ thin films with different thicknesses were grown on miscut
SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates. Magneto-transport measurements were carried out in
magnetic fields up to 35 T, and quantum oscillations with different frequencies
were observed and compared to the calculated band structure. In particular, we
discovered a frequency $F \approx$ 30 T at low temperatures and above 3 T that
corresponds to a small Fermi pocket with a light effective mass. Its
oscillation amplitude appears to be at maximum for film thicknesses in a range
of 10 to 20 nm, and the phase of the oscillation exhibits a systematic change
with the film thickness. After isolating the well separated frequencies, the
constructed Landau fan diagram shows an unusual concave downward curvature in
the 1/$\mu_0H_n$-$n$ curve, where $n$ is the Landau level index. Based on the
rigorous analysis of the thickness and field-orientation dependence of the
quantum oscillations, the oscillation with $F \approx$ 30 T is attributed to be
of surface origin, which is related to the Fermi-arc surface state originating
from non-overlapping Weyl nodes projected on the film's surface plane. Those
findings can be understood within the framework of the Weyl-orbit quantum

their potential in vital sectors, such as healthcare and finance, to derive
proper inferences. The sensitive and confidential nature of the data in such
sectors raises genuine concerns for data privacy. This motivated the area of
Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML), where privacy of data is
guaranteed. In this thesis, we design an efficient platform, MPCLeague, for
PPML in the Secure Outsourced Computation (SOC) setting using Secure
Multi-party Computation (MPC) techniques.
  MPC, the holy-grail problem of secure distributed computing, enables a set of
n mutually distrusting parties to perform joint computation on their private
inputs in a way that no coalition of t parties can learn more information than
the output (privacy) or affect the true output of the computation
(correctness). While MPC, in general, has been a subject of extensive research,
the area of MPC with a small number of parties has drawn popularity of late
mainly due to its application to real-time scenarios, efficiency and
simplicity. This thesis focuses on designing efficient MPC frameworks for 2, 3
and 4 parties, with at most one corruption and supports ring structures.
  At the heart of this thesis are four frameworks - ASTRA, SWIFT, Tetrad,
ABY2.0 - catered to different settings. The practicality of our framework is
argued through improvements in the benchmarking of widely used ML algorithms --
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector
Machines. We propose two variants for each of our frameworks, with one variant
aiming to minimise the execution time while the other focuses on the monetary
cost. The concrete efficiency gains of our frameworks coupled with the stronger
security guarantee of robustness make our platform an ideal choice for a
real-time deployment of PPML techniques.

neural generative models such as GANs, but have the drawback that they often
require a huge number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) during synthesis
unless some sophisticated sampling strategies are employed. This paper proposes
new efficient samplers based on the numerical schemes derived by the familiar
Taylor expansion, which directly solves the ODE/SDE of interest. In general, it
is not easy to compute the derivatives that are required in higher-order Taylor
schemes, but in the case of diffusion models, this difficulty is alleviated by
the trick that the authors call ``ideal derivative substitution,'' in which the
higher-order derivatives are replaced by tractable ones. To derive ideal
derivatives, the authors argue the ``single point approximation,'' in which the
true score function is approximated by a conditional one, holds in many cases,
and considered the derivatives of this approximation. Applying thus obtained
new quasi-Taylor samplers to image generation tasks, the authors experimentally
confirmed that the proposed samplers could synthesize plausible images in small
number of NFEs, and that the performance was better or at the same level as
DDIM and Runge-Kutta methods. The paper also argues the relevance of the
proposed samplers to the existing ones mentioned above.

elements inside the material to open gaps in the subwavelength regime.
Unfortunately, one usually has no precise control on the properties of the

this work, we propose a new construction to couple acoustic resonators such
that acoustic modes are mapped exactly to the eigenmodes of the

neural networks to encode the data center topology and server architecture. In
view of a common lack of precise reward samples corresponding to different
placements, a job interference model is further devised to predict interference
levels in face of various co-locations, for training of the MARL schedulers.
Testbed and trace-driven evaluations show that our scheduler framework
outperforms representative scheduling schemes by more than 20% in terms of
average JCT, and is adaptive to various machine learning cluster topologies.

two-dimensional harmonic trap rotating at angular frequency $\Omega>0$. The
support of the density of the Fermi gas is a disk of radius $R_e$. We calculate
the variance of the number of fermions ${\cal N}_R$ inside a disk of radius $R$
centered at the origin for $R$ in the bulk of the Fermi gas. We find rich and
interesting behaviours in two different scaling regimes: (i) $\Omega / \omega
<1 $ and (ii) $1 - \Omega / \omega = O(1/N)$, where $\omega$ is the angular
frequency of the oscillator. In the first regime (i) we find that ${\rm
Var}\,{\cal N}_{R}\simeq\left(A\log N+B\right)\sqrt{N}$ and we calculate $A$
and $B$ as functions of $R/R_e$, $\Omega$ and $\omega$. We also predict the
higher cumulants of ${\cal N}_{R}$ and the bipartite entanglement entropy of
the disk with the rest of the system. In the second regime (ii), the mean
fermion density exhibits a staircase form, with discrete plateaus corresponding
to filling $k$ successive Landau levels, as found in previous studies. Here, we
show that ${\rm Var}\,{\cal N}_{R}$ is a discontinuous piecewise linear
function of $\sim (R/R_e) \sqrt{N}$ within each plateau, with coefficients that
we calculate exactly, and with steps whose precise shape we obtain for any $k$.
We argue that a similar piecewise linear behavior extends to all the cumulants
of ${\cal N}_{R}$ and to the entanglement entropy. We show that these results
match smoothly at large $k$ with the above results for $\Omega/\omega=O(1)$.
These findings are nicely confirmed by numerical simulations. Finally, we
uncover a universal behavior of ${\rm Var}\,{\cal N}_{R}$ near the fermionic

additional confining potential is applied in the $z$ direction.

demonstrates that when the similarity between the auxiliary studies and the
target study is sufficiently high and the number of informative auxiliary
samples is sufficiently large, then the Trans-Copula-CLIME estimator shows
great advantage over the existing non-transfer-learning ones. Simulation
studies also show that Trans-Copula-CLIME estimator has better performance
especially when data are not from Gaussian distribution. At last, the proposed
method is applied to infer functional brain connectivity pattern for ADHD

topologically conjugate for all $n\geq m$. They are called strong shift

  In this paper we introduce a new category which generalises the category of
subshifts of finite type and topological conjugacy. Our category gives two new
notions of equivalence for digraphs which we call UDAF equivalence and weak
UDAF equivalence. UDAF equivalence is a coarser analogue of strong shift

equivalence. Both UDAF and weak UDAF equivalence still separate the n-leaf
roses for all $n\geq 2$ (the 1-vertex n-edge digraphs). However, UDAF
equivalence does not imply shift equivalence, in particular it equates the
2-leaf rose with the golden mean shift.

""V-type"" groups of Higman, Thompson and Brin. In particular for all $n\geq 2$
the groups $Out(G_{n, n-1})$ and $Out(nV)$ can be seen as automorphism groups
of specific objects in our category.
  We explain a few equivalent ways of viewing UDAF equivalence, and give an
example of how they can be used to show that Ashley's 8 vertex digraph is UDAF
equivalent to the 2-leaf rose.

(or permeability), and its refractive index has an imaginary part. Because of
the imaginary part, Snell's law does not hold for light-absorbing media.
Accordingly, other methods is required to determine the complex value of the
refractive index in a light-absorbing medium. The exact solution of Maxwell's

light-absorbing medium. Thereby the optical path was determined. The difference
of optical paths between light-absorbing medium and transparent medium was

determine the complex value of the refractive index using the optical path.
Both methods analyzed the solutions in detail for two specific incident angles.
The deviation angles corresponding to the two incident angles determined the

outer loop executes TBIM iteration steps, while the inner loop executes a
trained iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (TISTA). The applied TISTA
runs linear Landweber iterations implemented with a trained regularization
network designed based on U-net architecture. A normalization process was
imposed in TISTA that made TISTA training applicable within the proposed TBIM.
The iterative utilization of the regularization network in TISTA is a
bottleneck that demands high memory allocation through the training process.
Therefore TISTA within each TBIM step was trained separately. The TISTA
regularization network in each TBIM step was initialized using the weights from
the previous TBIM step. The above approach achieved high-quality image
restoration after running few TBIM steps while maintained low memory allocation
through the training process. The proposed framework can be extended to Newton
or quasi-Newton schemes, where within each Newton iteration, a linear ill-posed
problem is optimized that differs from one example to another. The numerical
results illustrated in this work show the superiority of the proposed TBIM
compared to the conventional sparse-based Born iterative method (SBIM).

usage these values also called function values. Like in Egypt also in Babylon
such a value system can be shown. The reconstructed calculation sequence, of
the Plimpton 322 cuneiform tablet, presented and described here, shows in its
completeness that, around 3800 years ago there already was a systematically
applied exact measuring system, with the usage of trigonometric function
values. With this approach one can plausibly explain that, as we still it
practice today, a geometry of the circle has been used for this calculation. It
is based on, but not only, of the usage of the regularities, which 1200 years
later, were named after Pythagoras. During a second calculation step, for an
intended scaled documentation, presentation or transfer to other locations, the
dimensionless calculated function value, was extended, with a fractional part,
or more exact spelled a common factor. This transformation creates a real
measurable length from the ratios, always related to the smallest unit. The
systematic usage by means of inclining triangles already in old Babylonian
times, goes far beyond the previously known level of this age. The accuracy of
the individual calculation is just as verifiable and on exactly the same level
as the trigonometric functions used today. However, at least at this point in
time, the Babylonians were content with dividing a quarter circle into at least
150 inclining triangles. This old Babylonian trigonometric function value
system, together with the here described ""Babylonian diagonal calculation"", is
thus the forerunner of the Greek chord calculation and the Indo-Arabic
trigonometric functions of the early Middle Ages, which we still use today. In
addition, the new approach to Plimpton 322 plausible explains why and how such

sequential decision-making from ground up. The history of interaction
constitutes a ""ground"" state of the system, which never repeats. On the one
hand, this generality allows GRL to model almost every domain possible, e.g.\
Bandits, MDPs, POMDPs, PSRs, and history-based environments. On the other hand,
in general, the near-optimal policies in GRL are functions of complete history,
which hinders not only learning but also planning in GRL. The usual way around
for the planning part is that the agent is given a Markovian abstraction of the
underlying process. So, it can use any MDP planning algorithm to find a
near-optimal policy. The Extreme State Aggregation (ESA) framework has extended
this idea to non-Markovian abstractions without compromising on the possibility
of planning through a (surrogate) MDP. A distinguishing feature of ESA is that
it proves an upper bound of $O\left(\varepsilon^{-A} \cdot
(1-\gamma)^{-2A}\right)$ on the number of states required for the surrogate MDP
(where $A$ is the number of actions, $\gamma$ is the discount-factor, and
$\varepsilon$ is the optimality-gap) which holds \emph{uniformly} for
\emph{all} domains. While the possibility of a universal bound is quite
remarkable, we show that this bound is very loose. We propose a novel non-MDP
abstraction which allows for a much better upper bound of
$O\left(\varepsilon^{-1} \cdot (1-\gamma)^{-2} \cdot A \cdot 2^{A}\right)$.
Furthermore, we show that this bound can be improved further to
$O\left(\varepsilon^{-1} \cdot (1-\gamma)^{-2} \cdot \log^3 A \right)$ by using
an action-sequentialization method.

nodes and edges in our network have weights and activation levels. They act as
probabilistic transducers that use a set of relatively simple rules to
determine how activation levels and weights are affected by input, generate
output, and affect each other. We show that these simple rules enable a
learning process that allows the network to represent increasingly complex

planning, decision-making, and the execution of behavior. By specifying the
innate (genetic) components of the network, we show how evolution could endow
the network with initial adaptive rules and goals that are then enriched
through learning. We demonstrate how the developing structure of the network
(which determines what the brain can do and how well) is critically affected by
the co-evolved coordination between the mechanisms affecting the distribution

conduct offline experiments on two industrial datasets and one public dataset

frame of stellar modeling. In our formulation, for any given static profile of
the energy density $\rho$ with the spherical symmetry and the arbitrary
equation of state (EoS) of matter, we can construct the model which reproduces
the profile. Because the profile of the energy density determines the mass $M$

mass $M$ and the radius $R_s$ of the compact star can be realized by adjusting
the potential and the coefficient function of the Gauss-Bonnet term in the
action of EGBS theory. This could be regarded as a degeneracy between the EoS
and the functions characterizing the model, which tells that only the
mass-radius relation is insufficient to constrain the model. For example, we
investigate a novel class of analytic spherically symmetric interior solutions

paper studies a UAV-aided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV
dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAV's
energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the
communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV's flight trajectory
subject to wind effect. The conventional successive convex approximation (SCA)
method can provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting
small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on trajectory
initialization and has not explicitly considered wind effect, while the
computational/trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with
large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design
framework with tailored initialization algorithm that can handle arbitrary data
volume efficiently, as well as a hybrid offline-online (HO2) design that
leverages convex stochastic programming (CSP) offline based on wind statistics,

Numerical results show that our optimized trajectory can better adapt to
various setups with different target data volume and buoys' topology as well as

extremely slow, quenching their kinetic energy. The emergence of
superconductivity thus appears paradoxical, as conventional BCS theory implies
a vanishing coherence length, superfluid stiffness, and critical current. Here,
using twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we explore the profound effect of
vanishingly small vF in a Dirac superconducting flat band system Using
Schwinger-limited non-linear transport studies, we demonstrate an extremely
slow vF ~ 1000 m/s for filling fraction nu between -1/2 and -3/4 of the moire
superlattice. In the superconducting state, the same velocity limit constitutes
a new limiting mechanism for the critical current, analogous to a relativistic
superfluid. Importantly, our measurement of superfluid stiffness, which
controls the superconductor's electrodynamic response, shows that it is not
dominated by the kinetic energy, but instead by the interaction-driven
superconducting gap, consistent with recent theories on a quantum geometric
contribution. We find evidence for small pairs, characteristic of the BCS to
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, with an unprecedented ratio of the
superconducting transition temperature to the Fermi temperature exceeding
unity, and discuss how this arises for very strong coupling superconductivity

and non-Markovian: we, humans, can neither revisit our past nor are the most
recent observations sufficient statistics. Yet, we excel at a variety of
complex tasks. Many of these tasks require longterm planning. We can associate
this success to our natural faculty to abstract away task-irrelevant
information from our overwhelming sensory experience. We make task-specific
mental models of the world without much effort. Due to this ability to
abstract, we can plan on a significantly compact representation of a task
without much loss of performance. Not only this, we also abstract our actions
to produce high-level plans: the level of action-abstraction can be anywhere
between small muscle movements to a mental notion of ""doing an action"". It is
natural to assume that any AGI agent competing with humans (at every plausible
domain) should also have these abilities to abstract its experiences and
actions. This thesis is an inquiry into the existence of such abstractions
which aid efficient planing for a wide range of domains, and most importantly,
these abstractions come with some optimality guarantees.

extracted in the form of time series data, which can be investigated with data
mining techniques to summarize behaviors of a range of subjects including

continuous sensor data recording results in datasets which are big in size and
volume, which are challenging to process and analyze with traditional
techniques in a timely manner. Such collected sensor data is typically
extracted in the form of time series data. There are two main approaches in the
literature, namely, shape-based classification and feature-based
classification. Shape-based classification determines the best class according
to a distance measure. Feature-based classification, on the other hand,
measures properties of the time series and finds the best class according to
the set of features defined for the time series. In this dissertation, we
demonstrate that neither of the two techniques will dominate for some problems,
but that some combination of both might be the best. In other words, on a
single problem, it might be possible that one of the techniques is better for
one subset of the behaviors, and the other technique is better for another
subset of behaviors. We introduce a hybrid algorithm to classify behaviors,
using both shape and feature measures, in weakly labeled time series data
collected from sensors to quantify specific behaviors performed by the subject.
We demonstrate that our algorithm can robustly classify real, noisy, and

study the relative importance of nodes in complex graphs. Recent years have
seen rapid growth in the scale of the graph, especially in industrial settings.
For example, our industrial partner runs popular social applications with
billions of users and is able to gather a rich set of user data. As a result,
applying K-core decomposition on large graphs has attracted more and more
attention from academics and the industry. A simple but effective method to
deal with large graphs is to train them in the distributed settings, and some
distributed K-core decomposition algorithms are also proposed. Despite their
effectiveness, we experimentally and theoretically observe that these
algorithms consume too many resources and become unstable on super-large-scale
graphs, especially when the given resources are limited. In this paper, we deal
with those super-large-scale graphs and propose a divide-and-conquer strategy
on top of the distributed K-core decomposition algorithm. We evaluate our
approach on three large graphs. The experimental results show that the
consumption of resources can be significantly reduced, and the calculation on
large-scale graphs becomes more stable than the existing methods. For example,
the distributed K-core decomposition algorithm can scale to a large graph with
136 billion edges without losing correctness with our divide-and-conquer
technique.

  Turbulence Prediction in Urban Air Mobility (UAM)","30 pages, 10 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To meet the growing mobility needs in intra-city transportation, the concept
of urban air mobility (UAM) has been proposed in which vertical takeoff and
landing (VTOL) aircraft are used to provide a ride-hailing service. In UAM,
aircraft can operate in designated air spaces known as corridors, that link the
aerodromes. A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables
UAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe
transportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity
performance for UAM, a spatial model is proposed. For this setup, the
distribution of the distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its
associated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced
by the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ratio
(SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity
performance of the UAM aircraft-to-ground communication network. Then,
leveraging these connectivity results, a wireless-enabled asynchronous
federated learning (AFL) framework that uses a Fourier neural network is
proposed to tackle the challenging problem of turbulence prediction during UAM
operations. For this AFL scheme, a staleness-aware global aggregation scheme is
introduced to expedite the convergence to the optimal turbulence prediction
model used by UAM aircraft. Simulation results validate the theoretical
derivations for the UAM wireless connectivity. The results also demonstrate
that the proposed AFL framework converges to the optimal turbulence prediction
model faster than the synchronous federated learning baselines and a
staleness-free AFL approach. Furthermore, the results characterize the
performance of wireless connectivity and convergence of the aircraft's
turbulence model under different parameter settings, offering useful UAM design
guidelines.

AirBnB) can be thought of as two-sided markets with producers and customers of
goods and services. Traditionally, recommendation services in these platforms
have focused on maximizing customer satisfaction by tailoring the results
according to the personalized preferences of individual customers. However, our
investigation reinforces the fact that such customer-centric design of these
services may lead to unfair distribution of exposure to the producers, which
may adversely impact their well-being. On the other hand, a pure
producer-centric design might become unfair to the customers. As more and more
people are depending on such platforms to earn a living, it is important to
ensure fairness to both producers and customers. In this work, by mapping a
fair personalized recommendation problem to a constrained version of the
problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods, we propose to provide fairness
guarantees for both sides. Formally, our proposed {\em FairRec} algorithm
guarantees Maxi-Min Share ($\alpha$-MMS) of exposure for the producers, and
Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) fairness for the customers. Extensive
evaluations over multiple real-world datasets show the effectiveness of {\em
FairRec} in ensuring two-sided fairness while incurring a marginal loss in
overall recommendation quality. Finally, we present a modification of FairRec
(named as FairRecPlus) that at the cost of additional computation time,
improves the recommendation performance for the customers, while maintaining
the same fairness guarantees.

inability to fully express their preferences over the execution times of their
orders, prone to latency arbitrage. In turn, we propose a new order type which
allows traders to specify the time at which their orders are executed after
reaching the exchange. Using this order type, traders can synchronize order
executions across different exchanges, such that high-frequency traders, even
if they operate at the speed of light, can no-longer engage in latency
arbitrage.
