electronic circuitry, which can be employed to steer the electromagnetic
signals in a controlled manner. Through this, the signal quality and the
effective data rate can be substantially improved. While the benefits of
RIS-assisted wireless communications have been investigated for various
scenarios, some aspects of the network design, such as coverage, optimal
placement of RIS, etc., often require complex optimization and numerical
simulations, since the achievable effective rate is difficult to predict. This
problem becomes even more difficult in the presence of phase estimation errors
or location uncertainty, which can lead to substantial performance degradation
if neglected. Considering randomly distributed receivers within a ring-shaped
RIS-assisted wireless network, this paper mainly investigates the effective
rate by taking into account the above-mentioned impairments. Furthermore, exact
closed-form expressions for the effective rate are derived in terms of Meijer's
$G$-function, which (i) reveals that the location and phase estimation
uncertainty should be well considered in the deployment of RIS in wireless
networks; and (ii) facilitates future network design and performance
prediction.

target information system. Usually, the cyber-attacks are characterized as
hybrid TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and long-term adversarial
behaviors, making the traditional intrusion detection methods ineffective. Most
existing cyber-attack detection systems are implemented based on manually
designed rules by referring to domain knowledge (e.g., threat models, threat
intelligences). However, this process is lack of intelligence and
generalization ability. Aiming at this limitation, this paper proposes an
intelligent cyber-attack detection method based on provenance data. To
effective and efficient detect cyber-attacks from a huge number of system
events in the provenance data, we firstly model the provenance data by a
heterogeneous graph to capture the rich context information of each system
entities (e.g., process, file, socket, etc.), and learns a semantic vector
representation for each system entity. Then, we perform online cyber-attack
detection by sampling a small and compact local graph from the heterogeneous
graph, and classifying the key system entities as malicious or benign. We
conducted a series of experiments on two provenance datasets with real
cyber-attacks. The experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms
other learning based detection models, and has competitive performance against
state-of-the-art rule based cyber-attack detection systems.

away quickly. We supplement this scenario with a CP-violating interaction,
which creates a chiral asymmetry in the population of dark matter particles. In
the false vacuum phase, a portal interaction quickly converts the dark sector
chiral asymmetry into a Standard Model lepton asymmetry. The lepton asymmetry
is then partially converted to a baryon asymmetry by standard electroweak
sphaleron processes. We discuss the dependence of the generated asymmetry on
the parameters of the model for two different portal interactions and
demonstrate successful baryogenesis for both. For one of the portals, it is
also possible to simultaneously explain the observed dark matter abundance,
over many orders of magnitude in the dark matter mass.

demand for spectrum use arising from recent technological breakthroughs in
wireless communication, the problem of interference continues to persist.
Despite recent advancements in resolving interference issues, interference
still presents a difficult challenge to effective usage of the spectrum. This
is partly due to the rise in the use of license-free and managed shared bands
for Wi-Fi, long term evolution (LTE) unlicensed (LTE-U), LTE licensed assisted
access (LAA), 5G NR, and other opportunistic spectrum access solutions. As a
result of this, the need for efficient spectrum usage schemes that are robust
against interference has never been more important. In the past, most solutions
to interference have addressed the problem by using avoidance techniques as
well as non-AI mitigation approaches (for example, adaptive filters). The key
downside to non-AI techniques is the need for domain expertise in the
extraction or exploitation of signal features such as cyclostationarity,
bandwidth and modulation of the interfering signals. More recently, researchers
have successfully explored AI/ML enabled physical (PHY) layer techniques,
especially deep learning which reduces or compensates for the interfering
signal instead of simply avoiding it. The underlying idea of ML based
approaches is to learn the interference or the interference characteristics
from the data, thereby sidelining the need for domain expertise in suppressing
the interference. In this paper, we review a wide range of techniques that have
used deep learning to suppress interference. We provide comparison and
guidelines for many different types of deep learning techniques in interference
suppression. In addition, we highlight challenges and potential future research
directions for the successful adoption of deep learning in interference
suppression.

trace the different phases of star cluster dynamical evolution. As expected, a
central density cusp, deviating from the King model profile, develops during
the core collapse (CC) event. Although the slope varies during the post-CC
oscillations, the cusp remains a stable feature characterizing the central
portion of the density profile in all post-CC stages. We then investigate the
normalized cumulative radial distribution (nCRD) drawn by all the cluster stars
included within one half the tridimensional half-mass radius (R<0.5 rh),
finding that its morphology varies in time according to the cluster's dynamical
stage. To quantify these changes we defined three parameters: A5, the area
subtended by the nCRD within 5% of the half-mass radius, P5, the value of the
nCRD measured at the same distance, and S2.5, the slope of the straight line
tangent to the nCRD measured at R=2.5% rh. The three parameters evolve
similarly during the cluster's dynamical evolution: after an early phase in
which they are essentially constant, their values rapidly increase, reaching
their maximum at the CC epoch and slightly decreasing in the post-CC phase,
when their average value remains significantly larger than the initial one, in
spite of some fluctuations. The results presented in the paper suggest that
these three observable parameters are very promising empirical tools to
identify the star cluster's dynamical stage from observational data.

discrepancy between the measured magnetic dipole moment of the muon, and its
prediction in the Standard Model (SM). In this study, we address the anomaly by
considering a minimal and generic extension to the SM which also provides for a
dark matter (DM) candidate. The extra states in this framework are: a SM
singlet Majorana fermion, referred to as the Bino, playing the role of DM; and
muonic scalars, referred to as sleptons. The couplings between the sleptons, SM
muons and the Bino can account for the muon $g-2$ anomaly if the scalar muon
partners, or smuons, mix chirality. On the other hand, the DM relic density is
satisfied primarily through coannihilation effects involving the Bino and the
lighter sleptons. The viable parameter space of our model includes regions with
relatively light coannihilating particles, similar to what has been found in
previous scans of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Relaxing
the assumption of minimal flavor violation typically assumed in the MSSM, we
see that scenarios with sizable smuon mixing and large mass splittings between
the smuons can satisfy both the muon $g-2$ anomaly and the DM relic density for
coannihilating particle masses up to and beyond the TeV scale. When we specify
the origin of the left-right smuon mixing to be trilinear couplings between the
smuons and the SM Higgs boson, the constraints on these scenarios arising from
perturbative unitarity and electroweak vacuum stability confine the
coannihilating particle masses to be $\lesssim$ 1 TeV. We demonstrate that next
generation direct detection experiments are only marginally sensitive to the
viable parameter space of our model and, thus, a future lepton collider could
be the essential probe necessary to distinguish our model from other BSM
solutions to the muon $g-2$ anomaly.

Activation Maps (CAMs) to play as the initial pseudo labels, which tend to
focus on the discriminative image regions and lack customized characteristics
for the segmentation task. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel
activation modulation and recalibration (AMR) scheme, which leverages a
spotlight branch and a compensation branch to obtain weighted CAMs that can
provide recalibration supervision and task-specific concepts. Specifically, an
attention modulation module (AMM) is employed to rearrange the distribution of
feature importance from the channel-spatial sequential perspective, which helps
to explicitly model channel-wise interdependencies and spatial encodings to
adaptively modulate segmentation-oriented activation responses. Furthermore, we
introduce a cross pseudo supervision for dual branches, which can be regarded
as a semantic similar regularization to mutually refine two branches. Extensive
experiments show that AMR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, surpassing not only current methods trained with the
image-level of supervision but also some methods relying on stronger

long-term, covert and sustained attack on specific targets, with an adversary
using advanced attack techniques to destroy the key facilities of an
organization. APT attacks have caused serious security threats and massive
financial loss worldwide. Academics and industry thereby have proposed a series
of solutions to detect APT attacks, such as dynamic/static code analysis,
traffic detection, sandbox technology, endpoint detection and response (EDR),
etc. However, existing defenses are failed to accurately and effectively defend
against the current APT attacks that exhibit strong persistent, stealthy,
diverse and dynamic characteristics due to the weak data source integrity,
large data processing overhead and poor real-time performance in the process of
real-world scenarios.
  To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose APTSHIELD, a stable,
efficient and real-time APT detection system for Linux hosts. In the aspect of
data collection, audit is selected to stably collect kernel data of the
operating system so as to carry out a complete portrait of the attack based on
comprehensive analysis and comparison of existing logging tools; In the aspect
of data processing, redundant semantics skipping and non-viable node pruning
are adopted to reduce the amount of data, so as to reduce the overhead of the
detection system; In the aspect of attack detection, an APT attack detection
framework based on ATT\&CK model is designed to carry out real-time attack
response and alarm through the transfer and aggregation of labels. Experimental
results on both laboratory and Darpa Engagement show that our system can
effectively detect web vulnerability attacks, file-less attacks and remote

with a viscosity ratio exceeding 2.2 at $244\,\mathrm{K}$. As temperature $T$

of inferring FDs for multiple relations as they occur in integrated views by
solely using the functional dependencies of the base relations of the view
itself. To this purpose, we leverage logical inference and selective mining and
show that we can discover most of the exact FDs from the base relations and
avoid the full computation of the FDs for the integrated view itself, while at
the same time preserving the lineage of FDs of base relations. We propose
algorithms to speedup the inferred FD discovery process and mine FDs on-the-fly
only from necessary data partitions. We present InFine(INferred FunctIoNal

on a range of real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the benefits of our
method over existing FD discovery methods that need to rerun the discovery

Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm. This problem
is challenging when each robot considers its path without explicitly sharing
observations with other robots and can lead to non-stationary issues in Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The typical CTDE algorithm factorizes the joint
action-value function into individual ones, to favor cooperation and achieve
decentralized execution. Such factorization involves constraints (e.g.,
monotonicity) that limit the emergence of novel behaviors in an individual as
each agent is trained starting from a joint action-value. In contrast, we
propose a novel architecture for CTDE that uses a centralized state-value
network to compute a joint state-value, which is used to inject global state
information in the value-based updates of the agents. Consequently, each model
computes its gradient update for the weights, considering the overall state of
the environment. Our idea follows the insights of Dueling Networks as a
separate estimation of the joint state-value has both the advantage of
improving sample efficiency, while providing each robot information whether the
global state is (or is not) valuable. Experiments in a robotic navigation task
with 2 4, and 8 robots, confirm the superior performance of our approach over

from an intricate trade-off between physical security on the one side and

demonstrate that radio wave propagation in an enclosed system of complex

anti-tamper radio (ATR) solution as a method for tamper detection, which
combines high detection sensitivity and reliability with ease-of-use. ATR
constantly monitors the wireless signal propagation behavior within the

physical security such as servers, ATMs, and smart meters. As a case study, we

the correct ground state of MnO. The relative energy differences of zinc-blende
(zb) and rock-salt (rs) structures as computed using MGGAC are found to be in
nice agreement with those obtained from high-level correlation methods like the
random phase approximation or quantum Monte Carlo techniques. Besides, we have
also applied the onsite hybrid functionals (closely related to DFT+U ) based on
GGA and meta-GGA functionals, and it is shown that a relatively high amount of
Hartree-Fock exchange is necessary to obtain the correct ground-state
structure. Our present investigation suggests that the semilocal MGGAC and
onsite hybrids, both being computationally cheap, as methods of choice for the
calculation of the relative stability of antiferromagnetic transition-metal
oxides having potential applications in solid-state physics and structural
chemistry.

pattern in Faraday Rotation (XRM), to that produced by the advection part of
the classical dynamo.We find that the characteristic X magnetic field
polarization in the plane of the sky, found in edge-on spiral galaxies, can
develop magnetohydromagnetically from an initial disc magnetic field combined
with wind and rotation. The Rotation Measure develops a corresponding X
distribution in sign, but this distribution is not a `universal' behaviour
because it depends primarily on the velocity field. We use Cauchy evolution of
an initial magnetic field to find the field at some later time and place. A
`battery' mechanism that requires current to always flow out of a galaxy has
been recently suggested, which contrasts with the conclusions of this paper.
Either explanation has significant consequences for the structure of a spiral
galaxy. If the battery mechanism applies then we have a new method of producing
magnetic field independent of the traditional dynamo. If however the flow
mechanism applies; then constraints concerning the presence and nature of a
galactic wind, together with the signature of the mean radial magnetic field,
can be inferred.

ASXDF1100.053.1 is an unlensed optically dark millimetre-bright SMG with
$K_{\rm AB}>25.7$ ($2\sigma$), which was expected to lie at $z=$5-7 based on
its radio-submm photo-$z$. Our data detected line emission due to
$^{12}$CO($J=$5-4) and ($J=$6-5), providing a $z_{\rm CO}= 5.2383\pm0.0005$.
Energy-coupled SED modelling indicates properties of $L_{\rm
IR}=8.3^{+1.5}_{-1.4}\times10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$, SFR $=630^{+260}_{-380}$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}=4.4^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times10^{8}$
M$_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm stellar}=3.5^{+3.6}_{-1.4}\times10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, and
$T_{\rm dust}=37.4^{+2.3}_{-1.8}$ K. The CO luminosity allows us to estimate a
gas mass $M_{\rm gas}=3.1\pm0.3\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, suggesting a
gas-to-dust mass ratio of around 70, fairly typical for $z\sim2$ SMGs.
ASXDF1100.053.1 has $R_{\rm e, mm}=1.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ kpc, so its surface
$L_{\rm IR}$ density $\Sigma_{\rm IR}$ is $1.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}\times10^{12}$
L$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$. These properties indicate that ASXDF1100.053.1 is a
massive dusty star-forming (SF) galaxy with an unusually compact starburst. It
lies close to the SF main sequence at $z\sim5$, with low $M_{\rm gas}$/$M_{\rm
stellar}=0.09$, SFR/SFR$_{\rm MS} (R_{\rm SB})=0.6$, and a gas-depletion time
$\tau_{\rm dep}$ of $\approx 50$ Myr, modulo assumptions about the stellar
initial mass function in such objects. ASXDF1100.053.1 has extreme values of
$M_{\rm gas}/M_{\rm stellar}$, $R_{\rm SB}$, and $\tau_{\rm dep}$ compared to
SMGs at $z\sim$2-4, and those of ASXDF1100.053.1 are the smallest among SMGs at
$z>5$. ASXDF1100.053.1 is likely a late-stage dusty starburst prior to
passivisation. The number of $z=$5.1-5.3 unlensed SMGs now suggests a number
density $dN/dz=30.4\pm19.0$ deg$^{-2}$, barely consistent with the latest
cosmological simulations.

hand precisely demanding that some concrete features are manifest lead to
different ways of organising perturbation theory. In the context of flat-space
scattering amplitudes, a number of them are already known and exploited, while
much less is known for cosmological observables. In the present work, we show
how to systematically write down both the wavefunction of the universe and the

physical poles only. We make use of the invariant definition of such
observables in terms of {\it cosmological polytopes} and their {\it scattering
facet}. In particular, we show that such representations correspond to
triangulations of such objects through hyperplanes identified by the
intersection of their facets outside of them. All possible triangulations of
this type generate the different representations. This allows us to provide a
general proof for the conjectured all-loop causal representation of scattering
amplitudes. Importantly, all such representations can be viewed as making
explicit a subset of compatible singularities, and our construction provides a
way to extend Steinmann relations to higher codimension singularities for both

(CRs). At GeV energies, these CRs undergo interactions with their environment
to produce $\gamma$-rays, and the unresolved $\gamma$-ray emission from
populations of SFGs forms a component of the isotropic extragalactic
$\gamma$-ray background (EGB). In this work, we investigate the contribution to
the 0.01 - 50 GeV EGB from SFG populations located up to redshift $z=3$. We
find this is dominated by starbursts, while the contribution from main sequence
SFGs is marginal at all energies. We also demonstrate that most of the
$\gamma$-ray contribution from SFGs emanates from low mass galaxies, with over
80 per cent of the emission originating from galaxies with stellar masses below
$10^8 \;\!{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Many of these galaxies are located at relatively
high redshift, with their peak EGB contribution arising $\sim$ 700 Myr before
the noon of cosmic star-formation. We find that the precise redshift
distributions of EGB sources at different energies imprint intensity signatures
at different angular scales, which may allow their contribution to be
distinguished using analyses of small-scale EGB intensity anisotropies,
particularly if the diffuse EGB is dominated by hadronic CR-driven $\gamma$-ray
emission from SFGs. We show that the EGB is sensitive to the evolution of low
mass populations of galaxies, particularly around $z\sim2.5$, and that it
provides a new means to probe the engagement of CRs in these galaxies before
the high noon of cosmic star-formation.

data-generating mechanisms in many complex applications but poses considerable
computational challenges. Observational data can only identify the equivalence
class of the directed acyclic graph underlying a Bayesian network model, and a
variety of methods exist to tackle the problem. Under certain assumptions, the
popular PC algorithm can consistently recover the correct equivalence class by
reverse-engineering the conditional independence (CI) relationships holding in
the variable distribution. The dual PC algorithm is a novel scheme to carry out
the CI tests within the PC algorithm by leveraging the inverse relationship
between covariance and precision matrices. By exploiting block matrix
inversions we can simultaneously perform tests on partial correlations of
complementary (or dual) conditioning sets. The multiple CI tests of the dual PC
algorithm proceed by first considering marginal and full-order CI relationships
and progressively moving to central-order ones. Simulation studies show that
the dual PC algorithm outperforms the classic PC algorithm both in terms of run
time and in recovering the underlying network structure, even in the presence
of deviations from Gaussianity. Additionally, we show that the dual PC
algorithm applies for Gaussian copula models, and demonstrate its performance
in that setting.

approximations (ICA) for solving topology optimization problems under the
assumption of geometric nonlinearity. The density-based problem formulation is
solved using a sequential piecewise linear programming (SPLP) algorithm. Five
distinct strategies have been proposed to control the frequency of the
factorizations of the Jacobian matrices of the nonlinear equilibrium equations.
Aiming at speeding up the overall iterative scheme while keeping the accuracy
of the approximate solutions, three of the strategies also use an ICA scheme
for the adjoint linear system associated with the sensitivity analysis. The
robustness of the proposed reanalysis strategies is corroborated by means of
numerical experiments with four benchmark problems -- two structures and two
compliant mechanisms. Besides assessing the performance of the strategies
considering a fixed budget of iterations, the impact of a theoretically
supported stopping criterion for the SPLP algorithm was analyzed as well.

  with the Domain Shift Problem on Spheroid Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background and objectives. Domain shift is a generalisation problem of
machine learning models that occurs when the data distribution of the training
set is different to the data distribution encountered by the model when it is
deployed. This is common in the context of biomedical image segmentation due to
the variance of experimental conditions, equipment, and capturing settings. In
this work, we address this challenge by studying both neural style transfer
algorithms and unpaired image-to-image translation methods in the context of
the segmentation of tumour spheroids.
  Methods. We have illustrated the domain shift problem in the context of
spheroid segmentation with 4 deep learning segmentation models that achieved an
IoU over 97% when tested with images following the training distribution, but
whose performance decreased up to an 84\% when applied to images captured under
different conditions. In order to deal with this problem, we have explored 3
style transfer algorithms (NST, deep image analogy, and STROTSS), and 6
unpaired image-to-image translations algorithms (CycleGAN, DualGAN, ForkGAN,
GANILLA, CUT, and FastCUT). These algorithms have been integrated into a
high-level API that facilitates their application to other contexts where the
domain-shift problem occurs.
  Results. We have considerably improved the performance of the 4 segmentation
models when applied to images captured under different conditions by using both
style transfer and image-to-image translation algorithms. In particular, there
are 2 style transfer algorithms (NST and deep image analogy) and 1 unpaired
image-to-image translations algorithm (CycleGAN) that improve the IoU of the
models in a range from 0.24 to 76.07. Therefore, reaching a similar performance
to the one obtained with the models are applied to images following the
training distribution.

distributed, that is, that they only rely on local real-time measurements and
communication with neighboring agents. Optimal Distributed Control (ODC)
problems are, however, highly intractable even in seemingly simple cases.
Recent work has thus proposed training Neural Network (NN) distributed
controllers. A main challenge of NN controllers is that they are not dependable
during and after training, that is, the closed-loop system may be unstable, and
the training may fail due to vanishing and exploding gradients. In this paper,
we address these issues for networks of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (pH)
systems, whose modeling power ranges from energy systems to non-holonomic
vehicles and chemical reactions. Specifically, we embrace the compositional
properties of pH systems to characterize deep Hamiltonian control policies with
built-in closed-loop stability guarantees, irrespective of the interconnection
topology and the chosen NN parameters. Furthermore, our setup enables
leveraging recent results on well-behaved neural ODEs to prevent the phenomenon
of vanishing gradients by design. Numerical experiments corroborate the
dependability of the proposed architecture, while matching the performance of
general neural network policies.

under-citation of papers authored by women relative to expected rates coupled
with a corresponding over-citation of papers authored by men relative to
expected rates. We explore the citation gap in contemporary physics, analyzing
over one million articles published over the last 25 years in 35 physics
journals that span a wide range of subfields. Using a model that predicts
papers' expected citation rates according to a set of characteristics separate
from author gender, we find a global bias wherein papers authored by women are
significantly under-cited, and papers authored by men are significantly
over-cited. Moreover, we find that citation behavior varies along several
dimensions, such that imbalances differ according to who is citing, where they
are citing, and how they are citing. Specifically, citation imbalance in favor
of man-authored papers is highest for papers authored by men, papers published
in general physics journals, and papers likely to be less familiar to citing

individual choice, the cumulative effects of these choices needlessly harm a
subset of scholars. We discuss several strategies for the mitigation of these

  limit",,,,"cs.CR cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  This dissertation demonstrates three new types of attacks against the KLJN
scheme. The first attack type is based on compromised RNGs. The first RNG
attacks are deterministic. First, Eve knows both noises. She can crack the bit
via Ohm's Law and one-bit powers within a fraction of the bit exchange period.
Second, Eve knows only Bob's noise, so she can learn Bob's resistance value via
Ohm's Law and Alice's resistance at the end of the bit exchange period. She can
also use a process of elimination. The second RNG attacks are statistical.
First, Eve has partial knowledge of Alice's and Bob's noises. She can crack the
bit by taking the highest cross-correlation between her noises and the measured
noise in the wire, and by taking the highest cross-correlation between her
noises and Alice's/Bob's noises. Second, Eve has partial knowledge of only
Alice's noise. She can still crack the bit, but after the bit exchange period.
The second attack type is based on thermodynamics. Previously, the KLJN scheme
required thermal equilibrium. However, Vadai, et al, in (Nature) Science
Reports shows a modified scheme, where there is a non-zero thermal noise, yet
the system resists all the known attacks. We utilize coincidence events between
the line current and voltage and show that there is non-zero information leak.
As soon as thermal equilibrium is restored, the system is perfectly secure
again. The final attack type is based on the nonlinearity of the noise
generators. We explore the effect of distortion at the second and third orders.
It is demonstrated that 1% distortion results in a significant information
leak. We also show that decreasing the effective temperature results in the
KLJN scheme approaching perfect security.

We show that blazars positionally associated with IceCube neutrino detections
have stronger parsec-scale radio cores than the rest of the sample. The
probability of a chance coincidence is only 4*10^-5 corresponding to a
significance of 4.1 sigma. We explicitly list four strong radio blazars as
highly probable sources of neutrinos above 200 TeV: 3C 279, NRAO 530, PKS
1741-038, and PKS 2145+067. There are at least 70 more radio-bright blazars
that emit neutrinos of lower energies, starting from TeVs. Using continuous
RATAN-600 monitoring of VLBI-selected blazars, we find that radio flares at
frequencies above 10 GHz coincide with neutrino arrival dates. The most
pronounced example of such behavior is PKS 1502+106 that experienced a major
flare in 2019. We demonstrate that the majority of IceCube astrophysical
neutrino flux derived from muon-track analyses may be explained by blazars,
that is, AGNs with bright Doppler-boosted jets. High-energy neutrinos can be
produced in photohadronic interactions within parsec-scale relativistic jets.
Radio-bright blazars associated with neutrino detections have very diverse
gamma-ray properties, which suggests that gamma-rays and neutrinos may be
produced in different regions of blazars and not directly related. A narrow jet
viewing angle is, however, required to detect either of them. We conclude with
discussion of recent independent tests and extensions of our findings.

new challenging tasks for them, has been a topic of much interest. Recent
studies have found these models to be surprisingly strong at performing
deductive reasoning over formal logical theories expressed in natural language.
A shortcoming of these studies, however, is that they do not take into account
that logical theories, when sampled uniformly at random, do not necessarily
lead to hard instances. We propose a new methodology for creating challenging
algorithmic reasoning datasets that focus on natural language satisfiability
(NLSat) problems. The key idea is to draw insights from empirical sampling of
hard propositional SAT problems and from complexity-theoretic studies of
language. This methodology allows us to distinguish easy from hard instances,
and to systematically increase the complexity of existing reasoning benchmarks
such as RuleTaker. We find that current transformers, given sufficient training
data, are surprisingly robust at solving the resulting NLSat problems of
substantially increased difficulty. They also exhibit some degree of
scale-invariance - the ability to generalize to problems of larger size and
scope. Our results, however, reveal important limitations too: a careful
sampling of training data is crucial for building models that generalize to
larger problems, and transformer models' limited scale-invariance suggests they
are far from learning robust deductive reasoning algorithms.

dynamical mass M200 about 5.4 10E14 solar masses. The global properties of
Abell 780 are typical of relaxed clusters. On a smaller scale, we can detect
the presence of a galaxy group associated with LEDA 87445 in projected phase
space. The mean velocity and position of the center of the group agree well
with the velocity and position of LEDA 87445. We estimate the following
parameters of the collision. The group is characterized by a higher velocity
relative to the main system. It is infalling at a rest frame velocity of
Vrf=+870 km/s and lies at a projected distance D=1.1 Mpc to the south, slightly
southeast of the cluster center. The mass ratio between the group and the

abundant conformer is depleted via optical pumping on the $S_{1} \leftarrow
S_{0}$ transition. Further downstream, three consecutive microwave pulses with
mutually perpendicular polarizations and with a well-defined duration and phase
are applied. The population in the originally depleted rotational level is
subsequently monitored via laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. This
scheme enables a quantitative comparison of experiment and theory for the
transfer efficiency in what is the simplest ESST triangle for any chiral
molecule, that is, the one involving the absolute ground state level,
$\left|J_{K_{a}K_{c}}\right\rangle = \left|0_{00}\right\rangle$. Moreover, this
scheme improves the enantiomer enrichment by over an order of magnitude
compared to previous works. Starting with a racemic mixture, a straightforward
extension of this scheme allows to create a molecular beam with an
enantiomer-pure rotational level, holding great prospects for future
spectroscopic and scattering studies.

the abundances, weak lensing, and the clustering of galaxy clusters. Our
analysis notably includes an empirical model for the anisotropic boosts
impacting the lensing and clustering signals of optical clusters. These boosts
arise from a preferential selection of clusters surrounded by anisotropic large
scale structure, a consequence of the limited discrimination between
line-of-sight interlopers and true cluster members offered by photometric
surveys. We validate our analysis via a blind cosmology challenge on mocks, and
find that we can obtain tight and unbiased cosmological constraints without
informative priors or external calibrations on any of our model parameters. We
then apply our analysis on the SDSS redMaPPer clusters, and find results
favoring low $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and high $\sigma_8$, combining to yield the
lensing strength constraint $S_8 = 0.718_{-0.021}^{+0.024}$. We investigate
potential drivers behind these results through a series of post-unblinding
tests, noting that our results are consistent with existing cluster cosmology
constraints but clearly inconsistent with other CMB/LSS based cosmology
results. From these tests, we find hints that a suppression in the cluster
lensing signal may be driving our results.

studies have shown that AV speech enhancement (SE) models can significantly
improve speech quality and intelligibility in very low signal to noise ratio

significant research in the area of AV SE, development of real-time processing

paper, we present a novel framework for low latency speaker-independent AV SE
that can generalise on a range of visual and acoustic noises. In particular, a
generative adversarial networks (GAN) is proposed to address the practical
issue of visual imperfections in AV SE. In addition, we propose a deep neural
network based real-time AV SE model that takes into account the cleaned visual
speech output from GAN to deliver more robust SE. The proposed framework is
evaluated on synthetic and real noisy AV corpora using objective speech quality
and intelligibility metrics and subjective listing tests. Comparative
simulation results show that our real time AV SE framework outperforms
state-of-the-art SE approaches, including recent DNN based SE models.

symmetries can be realized as matrix product operators which allow the
extraction of a fusion category that characterizes the algebra of all symmetric
operators commuting with the symmetry. Known as the bond algebra, its explicit
realizations are classified by module categories over the fusion category. A
duality is then defined by a pair of distinct module categories giving rise to
dual realizations of the bond algebra, as well as dual Hamiltonians. Symmetries
of dual models are in general distinct but satisfy a categorical Morita

construction of matrix product operators that intertwine dual bond algebra

Laplacian flow of closed G_2-structures on a 7-manifold, motivated by the
problem of understanding finite-time singularities of that flow. Here we focus
on solitons with symmetry groups Sp(2) and SU(3); in both cases we prove the
existence of continuous families of local cohomogeneity-one gradient Laplacian
solitons and characterise which of these local solutions extend smoothly over
their unique singular orbits. The main questions are then to determine which of
these smoothly-closing solutions extend to complete solitons and furthermore to
understand the asymptotic geometry of these complete solitons.
  We provide complete answers to both questions in the case of steady solitons.
Up to the actions of scaling and discrete symmetries, we show that the set of
all smoothly-closing SU(3)-invariant steady Laplacian solitons defined on a
neighbourhood of the zero-section of the anti-self-dual bundle of CP^2 is
parametrised by the set of nonnegative reals. An open interval I=(0,c)
corresponds to complete nontrivial gradient solitons that are asymptotic to the
unique SU(3)-invariant torsion-free G_2 cone. The boundary point 0 of I
corresponds to the well-known Bryant--Salamon asymptotically conical
G_2-manifold, while the other boundary point c corresponds to an explicit
complete gradient steady soliton with exponential volume growth and novel
asymptotic geometry. The open interval (c, oo) consists entirely of incomplete
solutions.
  In addition, we find an explicit complete gradient shrinking soliton on the
anti-self-dual bundle of S^4 and CP^2. Both these shrinkers are asymptotic to
closed but non-torsion-free G_2 cones. Like the nontrivial AC gradient steady
solitons on the anti-self-dual bundle of CP^2, these shrinkers appear to be
potential singularity models for finite-time singularities of Laplacian flow.

obscuring gas. We detect discrete features at the >=90% significance level both
in emission and in absorption at different times of the observations, split
into 5ks time-resolved spectra. The overall significance of individual features
is higher in the obscured dataset. The energy distribution of the detections
changes between the two states of the source, and the features appear to
cluster at different energies. Counting the occurrences of emission/absorption
lines at the same energies, we identify several groups of $\geq3\sigma$
detections: emission features in the 4-6 keV band are present in all

large scale environments with many agents as they often scale poorly with the
number of agents. Using mean field theory to aggregate agents has been proposed
as a solution to this problem. However, almost all previous methods in this
area make a strong assumption of a centralized system where all the agents in
the environment learn the same policy and are effectively indistinguishable
from each other. In this paper, we relax this assumption about
indistinguishable agents and propose a new mean field system known as
Decentralized Mean Field Games, where each agent can be quite different from
others. All agents learn independent policies in a decentralized fashion, based
on their local observations. We define a theoretical solution concept for this
system and provide a fixed point guarantee for a Q-learning based algorithm in
this system. A practical consequence of our approach is that we can address a
`chicken-and-egg' problem in empirical mean field reinforcement learning
algorithms. Further, we provide Q-learning and actor-critic algorithms that use
the decentralized mean field learning approach and give stronger performances
compared to common baselines in this area. In our setting, agents do not need
to be clones of each other and learn in a fully decentralized fashion. Hence,
for the first time, we show the application of mean field learning methods in
fully competitive environments, large-scale continuous action space
environments, and other environments with heterogeneous agents. Importantly, we
also apply the mean field method in a ride-sharing problem using a real-world
dataset. We propose a decentralized solution to this problem, which is more
practical than existing centralized training methods.

hypothesis is that SSGs result from rapid rotation in subgiants or giants due
to tidal synchronization in a close binary. The strong magnetic fields
generated inhibit convection, which in turn produces large starspots, radius
inflation, and lower-than-expected average surface temperatures and
luminosities. Here we cross-reference a catalog of active giant binaries (RS
CVns) in the field with Gaia EDR3. Using the Gaia photometry and parallaxes we
precisely position the RS CVns in a CMD. We identify stars that fall below a 14
Gyr, metal-rich isochrone as candidate field SSGs. Out of a sample of 1723 RS
CVn, we find 448 SSG candidates, a dramatic expansion from the 65 SSGs
previously known. Most SSGs have rotation periods of 2-20 days, with the
highest SSG fraction found among RS CVn with the shortest periods. The ubiquity
of SSGs among this population indicates SSGs are a normal phase in evolution

only in dense star clusters as some have suggested. We present our catalog of

popular scenarios for Dark Matter (DM) theories that however is strongly
constrained, in particular by direct detection experiments. We stick with the
WIMP hypothesis and consider a Dirac fermion candidate for DM that interacts
with the Standard Model (SM) via a spin-1 $Z'$, arising from the spontaneous
breaking of an Abelian $U(1)'_{\mu}$ gauge symmetry, under which only second
generation leptons and the DM are appropriately charged. Due to the charge
assignment, the model is gauge anomalous and can only be interpreted as an
effective field theory (EFT) at low energy. The $Z'$ couples at tree level only
to the vector DM current, to the axial muon current and to left-handed muonic
neutrinos, so the WIMP-nucleon cross section is beyond the experimental reach
of spin-independent (SI) direct detection searches. We study the current bounds
on this model coming from direct and indirect detection of DM, collider
searches, contributions to $(g-2)_{\mu}$ and to neutrino trident production. We
find that large regions of the parameter space remains to be explored. In the
context of LHC searches, we study the impact of a muon-exclusive signal region
for the $3\mu$ + ${E}^{{\rm miss}}_T$ channel with an invariant mass window
around $m_{Z'}$. We show that this search can significantly improve the current
collider bounds. Finally, from the anomalous nature of our EFT, there remain at
low energy triboson anomalous interactions between the $Z'$ and the electroweak
(EW) SM gauge bosons. We explore the possibilities of probing these
interactions at the LHC and at a 100 TeV proton collider finding it extremely
challenging. On the other hand, for a muon collider the resonant channel
$\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\to Z'\to ZZ$ could be discovered in the most promising scenario

intergalactic medium allows us to probe the linear matter power spectrum down
to relatively small distance scales. Finding ways of accurately evaluating
Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints across large classes of candidate models of
dark-matter physics is thus of paramount importance. While such constraints
have been evaluated for dark-matter models with relatively simple dark-matter
velocity distributions, more complex models -- particularly those with
dark-matter velocity distributions stretching across multiple scales -- are
receiving increasing attention. In this paper, we undertake a study of the
Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints associated with general dark-matter velocity
distributions. Although these constraints are difficult to evaluate in
principle, in practice there exist two ways of recasting them into forms which
are easier to evaluate and which therefore allow a more rapid determination of
whether a given dark-matter model is ruled in or out. We utilize both of these
recasts in order to determine the Lyman-$\alpha$ bounds on different classes of
dark-matter velocity distributions. We also develop a general method by which
the results of these different recasts can be compared. For relatively simple
dark-matter velocity distributions, we find that these two classes of recasts
tend to align and give similar results. However, the situation is far more
complex for distributions involving multiple velocity scales: while these two
recasts continue to yield similar results within certain regions of parameter
space, they nevertheless yield dramatically different results within precisely
those regions of parameter space which are likely to be phenomenologically
relevant. This, then, serves as a cautionary tale regarding the use of such
recasts for complex dark-matter velocity distributions.

long distances in terms of a non-trivial resummation of infinitely many
diagrams. Long ago, 't Hooft proposed a beautiful correspondence between
ultra-relativistic scalar eikonal scattering and one-to-one scattering in a
background shockwave space-time, bypassing the need to resum. In this spirit,
we propose here a covariant method for computing one-to-one amplitudes in
curved background space-times which gives rise what we conjecture to be a
general expression for the eikonal amplitude. We show how the one-to-one
scattering amplitude for scalars on any stationary space-time reduces to a
boundary term that captures the long-distance behavior of the background and
has the structure of an exponentiated eikonal amplitude. In the case of scalar
scattering on Schwarzschild, we recover the known results for gravitational
scattering of massive scalars in the eikonal regime. For Kerr, we find a
remarkable exponentiation of the tree-level amplitude for gravitational
scattering between a massive scalar and a massive particle of infinite spin.
This amplitude exhibits a Kawai-Lewellen-Tye-like factorization, which we use
to evaluate the eikonal amplitude in momentum space, and study its analytic
properties.

the superconducting transition. Our findings not only elucidate the rich

particular, we confirm the existence of Q-ball solutions with $\phi \sim
10^{17}-10^{18}$ GeV, consistent with the range of field values following the
end of slow-roll Palatini inflation. We study the Q-balls and their properties
both numerically and in an analytical approximation. The existence of such
Q-balls suggests that the complex inflaton condensate can fragment into
Q-balls, and that there may be an analogous process for the case of a real
inflaton with fragmentation to neutral oscillons. We discuss the possible
post-inflationary cosmology following the formation of Q-balls, including an
early Q-ball matter domination (eMD) period and the effects of this on the
reheating dynamics of the model, gravitational wave signatures which may be
detectable in future experiments, and the possibility that Q-balls could lead
to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). In particular, we show that
Palatini Q-balls with field strengths typical of inflaton condensate
fragmentation can directly form black holes with masses around 500 kg or more
when the self-coupling is $\lambda = 0.1$, resulting in very low (less than 100
GeV) reheating temperatures from black hole decay, with smaller black hole
masses and larger reheating temperatures possible for smaller values of

the area of the entanglement wedge cross section. We study the same problem in

tensor we analyze the important non-perturbative effects that smooth out the
discontinuity in the reflected entropy across the Page phase transition. By
summing over all such effects, we obtain the reflected entanglement spectrum
analytically, which agrees well with numerical studies. This motivates a
prescription for the analytic continuation required in computing the reflected
entropy and its R\'enyi generalization which resolves an order of limits issue
previously identified in the literature. We apply this prescription to
hyperbolic tensor networks and find answers consistent with holographic
expectations. In particular, the random tensor network has the same non-trivial
tripartite entanglement structure expected from holographic states. We
furthermore show that the reflected R\'enyi spectrum is not flat, in sharp
contrast to the usual R\'enyi spectrum of these networks. We argue that the
various distinct contributions to the reflected entanglement spectrum can be
organized into approximate superselection sectors. We interpret this as
resulting from an effective description of the canonically purified state as a
superposition of distinct tensor network states. Each network is constructed by
doubling and gluing various candidate entanglement wedges of the original
network. The superselection sectors are labelled by the different
cross-sectional areas of these candidate entanglement wedges.

They also gave a general upper bound tradeoff of hop-diameter at most $k$ and

one-dimensional models have generally been considered adequate with current
data quality. However, recent studies have suggested that using 1D models in
retrievals can result in anomalously cool terminator temperatures and biased
abundance estimates even with existing transmission spectra of hot Jupiters.
Motivated by these claims and upcoming high-quality transmission spectra we
systematically explore the limitations of 1D models using synthetic and current
observations. We use 1D models of varying complexity, both analytic and
numerical, to revisit claims of biases when interpreting transmission spectra
of hot Jupiters with inhomogeneous terminator compositions. Overall, we find
the reported biases to be resulting from specific model assumptions rather than
intrinsic limitations of 1D atmospheric models in retrieving current
observations of asymmetric terminators. Additionally, we revise atmospheric
retrievals of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b ($T_{\rm eq}=1440$ K) and the ultra-hot
Jupiter WASP-103b ($T_{\rm eq}=2484$ K ) for which previous studies inferred
abnormally cool atmospheric temperatures. We retrieve temperatures consistent
with expectations. We note, however, that in the limit of extreme terminator
inhomogeneities and high data quality some atmospheric inferences may
conceivably be biased, although to a lesser extent than previously claimed. To
address such cases, we implement a 2D retrieval framework for transmission
spectra which allows accurate constraints on average atmospheric properties and
provides insights into the spectral ranges where the imprints of atmospheric
inhomogeneities are strongest. Our study highlights the need for careful
considerations of model assumptions and data quality before attributing biases
in retrieved estimates to unaccounted atmospheric inhomogeneities.

implicit surface regressor produces an iso-surface of a human occupancy field.
Importantly, at inference time, a feedback loop alternates between refining the
SMPL(-X) mesh using the inferred clothed normals and then refining the normals.
Given multiple reconstructed frames of a subject in varied poses, we use
SCANimate to produce an animatable avatar from them. Evaluation on the AGORA
and CAPE datasets shows that ICON outperforms the state of the art in
reconstruction, even with heavily limited training data. Additionally, it is
much more robust to out-of-distribution samples, e.g., in-the-wild poses/images
and out-of-frame cropping. ICON takes a step towards robust 3D clothed human
reconstruction from in-the-wild images. This enables creating avatars directly
from video with personalized and natural pose-dependent cloth deformation.

Distance Conjecture (SDC), and cosmological parameter tensions. EDE is a
proposed resolution of the Hubble tension relying upon a near-Planckian scalar
field excursion, while the SDC predicts an exponential sensitivity of masses of
other fields to such an excursion, $m\propto e^{-c|\Delta \phi|/M_{\rm pl}}$
with $c\sim{\cal O}(1)$. Meanwhile, EDE is in tension with large-scale
structure (LSS) data, due to shifts in the standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters
necessary to fit the cosmic microwave background (CMB). One might hope that a
proper treatment of the model, e.g., accounting for the SDC, may ameliorate the
tension with LSS. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce the Early
Dark Sector (EDS) model, wherein the mass of dark matter is exponentially
sensitive to super-Planckian field excursions of the EDE scalar. The EDS model
exhibits new phenomenology in both the early and late universe, the latter due
to an EDE-mediated dark matter self-interaction. This dark matter-philic ""fifth
force"", while constrained to be small, remains active in the late universe and
is not screened in virialized halos. We find that the new interaction with dark
matter partially resolves the LSS tension. However, the marginalized posteriors
are nonetheless consistent with $f_{\rm EDE}=0$ at 95$\%$ CL once the Dark
Energy Survey Year 3 measurement of $S_8$ is included. We study constraints on
the model from Atacama Cosmology Telescope data, and find a factor of two
improvement on the error bar on the SDC parameter $c$, along with an increased
preference for the EDE component. We discuss the implications of these
constraints for the SDC, and find the tightest observational constraints to
date on a swampland parameter, suggesting that an EDE description of
cosmological data is in tension with the SDC.

and temporal features into dimension-independent factors. Although previous
RGB-D-based motion recognition methods have achieved promising performance
through the tightly coupled multi-modal spatiotemporal representation, they
still suffer from (i) optimization difficulty under small data setting due to
the tightly spatiotemporal-entangled modeling;(ii) information redundancy as it
usually contains lots of marginal information that is weakly relevant to
classification; and (iii) low interaction between multi-modal spatiotemporal
information caused by insufficient late fusion. To alleviate these drawbacks,
we propose to decouple and recouple spatiotemporal representation for
RGB-D-based motion recognition. Specifically, we disentangle the task of
learning spatiotemporal representation into 3 sub-tasks: (1) Learning
high-quality and dimension independent features through a decoupled spatial and
temporal modeling network. (2) Recoupling the decoupled representation to
establish stronger space-time dependency. (3) Introducing a Cross-modal
Adaptive Posterior Fusion (CAPF) mechanism to capture cross-modal
spatiotemporal information from RGB-D data. Seamless combination of these novel
designs forms a robust spatialtemporal representation and achieves better
performance than state-of-the-art methods on four public motion datasets. Our

a putative membrane limit arises, up to duality, from an M5-brane wrapping the

where the Lund declusterings are used to train a neural network. For both
approaches, we either consider only the primary Lund plane or the full

be equivalent on a toy event sample resumming exactly leading collinear single

ratio. On a full Monte Carlo event sample, both approaches show a good
discriminating power, with the machine-learning models usually being superior.
We carry on a study in the asymptotic limit of large logarithm, allowing us to
gain confidence that this superior performance comes from effects that are
subleading in our analytic approach. We then compare our approach to other
quark-gluon discriminants in the literature. Finally, we study the resilience
of our quark-gluon discriminants against the details of the event sample and

producing extremely short, repetitive bursts of accretion onto magnetized white
dwarfs in intermediate polars (IPs), but this phenomenon has not been detected
previously in a confirmed IP. We report the 27-day TESS light curve of V1025
Cen, an IP that shows a remarkable series of twelve bursts of accretion, each
lasting for less than six hours. The extreme brevity of the bursts and their
short recurrence times (~1-3 days) are incompatible with the dwarf-nova
instability, but they are natural consequences of the magnetic gating mechanism
developed by Spruit & Taam to explain the Type II bursts of the accreting
neutron star known as the Rapid Burster. In this model, the accretion flow
piles up at the magnetospheric boundary and presses inward until it couples
with the star's magnetic field, producing an abrupt burst of accretion. After
each burst, the reservoir of matter at the edge of the magnetosphere is
replenished, leading to cyclical bursts of accretion. A pair of recent studies
applied this instability to the suspected IPs MV Lyr and TW Pic, but the
magnetic nature of these two systems has not been independently confirmed. In
contrast, previous studies have unambiguously established the white dwarf in
V1025 Cen to be significantly magnetized. The detection of magnetically gated
bursts in a confirmed IP therefore validates the extension of the Spruit & Taam
instability to magnetized white dwarfs.

Direct correlation analysis and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have been

the optical spectra and the soft X-ray photon indices as another parameter. We
confirm that the established correlations for the general quasar population
hold for both types of galaxies in this sample despite significant differences

shape parameters, namely the asymmetry and kurtosis indices. We find that the
fraction of NLSy1 galaxies showing outflow signatures, characterized by blue
asymmetries, is higher by a factor of about 3 compared to the corresponding

region of NLSy1 galaxies in conjunction with higher Eddington ratios can be the
possible reason behind this phenomenon. We also explore the possibility of
using asymmetry in the emission lines as a tracer of outflows in the inner

alternative to the more prominent isolated learning scheme not only due to its
resemblance to biological learning, but also its potential to reduce energy
waste by obviating excessive model re-training. A key challenge to this
paradigm is the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. With the increasing
popularity and success of pre-trained models in machine learning, we pose the
question: What role does pre-training play in lifelong learning, specifically
with respect to catastrophic forgetting? We investigate existing methods in the
context of large, pre-trained models and evaluate their performance on a
variety of text and image classification tasks, including a large-scale study
using a novel dataset of 15 diverse NLP tasks. Across all settings, we observe
that generic pre-training implicitly alleviates the effects of catastrophic
forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially compared to randomly
initialized models. We then further investigate why pre-training alleviates
forgetting in this setting. We study this phenomenon by analyzing the loss
landscape, finding that pre-trained weights appear to ease forgetting by
leading to wider minima. Based on this insight, we propose jointly optimizing
for current task loss and loss basin sharpness in order to explicitly encourage
wider basins during sequential fine-tuning. We show that this optimization
approach leads to performance comparable to the state-of-the-art in
task-sequential continual learning across multiple settings, without retaining
a memory that scales in size with the number of tasks.

the terms that are linear in the curvature namely the Ricci scalar and the

the exact and unique solution of the affine connection we subsequently derive
the closed forms of spacetime torsion and non-metricity and also recast the
metric field equations into a GR form with modified source terms that are
quadratic in the hypermomentum and linear in its derivatives. We also study the
vacuum quadratic Theory and prove that in this instance, or more generally for

nbody6, and they feature a realistic stellar initial mass function and initial
binary star population, single star and binary star evolution, expulsion of the
primordial gas, and the tidal field of the galaxy. Our simulations provide the
first detailed dynamical picture of how frequently Cepheids remain
gravitationally bound to their birth clusters versus how frequently they occur
in the field. They allow us to quantify the relevance of various cluster escape
mechanisms and how they depend on stellar mass. Overall, the simulations agree
with the empirical picture that a small fraction ($\approx 10\%$) of Cepheids
reside in clusters, that cluster halo membership is relatively common, and that
the majority of Cepheid hosting clusters have only a single Cepheid member.
Additionally, the simulations predict that a) Cepheid progenitors are much more
likely to escape from low-mass than higher-mass clusters; b) higher-mass
(long-period) Cepheids are $\approx 30\%$ more likely to be found in clusters
than low-mass (short-period) Cepheids; c) the clustered Cepheid fraction
increases with galactocentric radius since cluster dispersal is less efficient
at greater radii; d) a lower metallicity reduces the overall clustered Cepheid
fraction; e) high-mass clusters are much more likely to have more than one
Cepheid member at any given time, in particular at a lower metallicity. We
interpret the results as outcomes of various aspects of star cluster dynamics.
The comparison of predicted and observed clustered Cepheid fractions, $f_{\rm

reframe this task into that of selecting a sequence of payoff functions that
maximize the wealth of a fictitious bettor, betting against the null in a
repeated game. In this setting, the relative increase in the bettor's wealth
has a precise interpretation as the measure of evidence against the null, and
thus our sequential test rejects the null when the wealth crosses an
appropriate threshold. We develop a general framework for setting up the
betting game for two-sample testing, in which the payoffs are selected by a
prediction strategy as data-driven predictable estimates of the witness
function associated with the variational representation of some statistical
distance measures, such as integral probability metrics (IPMs). We then
formally relate the statistical properties of the test~(such as consistency,
type-II error exponent and expected sample size) to the regret of the
corresponding prediction strategy. We construct a practical sequential
two-sample test by instantiating our general strategy with the kernel-MMD
metric, and demonstrate its ability to adapt to the difficulty of the unknown
alternative through theoretical and empirical results. Our framework is
versatile, and easily extends to other problems; we illustrate this by applying
our approach to construct consistent tests for the following problems: (i)
time-varying two-sample testing with non-exchangeable observations, and (ii) an

self-supervised learning, classification is the most common task used to
evaluate how good a representation is. However, relying only on such downstream
task can limit our understanding of what information is retained in the
representation of a given input. In this work, we showcase the use of a
Representation Conditional Diffusion Model (RCDM) to visualize in data space
the representations learned by self-supervised models. The use of RCDM is
motivated by its ability to generate high-quality samples -- on par with
state-of-the-art generative models -- while ensuring that the representations
of those samples are faithful i.e. close to the one used for conditioning. By
using RCDM to analyze self-supervised models, we are able to clearly show
visually that i) SSL (backbone) representation are not invariant to the data
augmentations they were trained with -- thus debunking an often restated but
mistaken belief; ii) SSL post-projector embeddings appear indeed invariant to
these data augmentation, along with many other data symmetries; iii) SSL
representations appear more robust to small adversarial perturbation of their
inputs than representations trained in a supervised manner; and iv) that
SSL-trained representations exhibit an inherent structure that can be explored
thanks to RCDM visualization and enables image manipulation.

the time signals coming from the student's cognitive information, and ii) RGB

suggest an inverse correlation between the eye blink frequency and the

the transitions of the Pushdown Automaton (PDA) of the corresponding CFL. With
the forced decomposition, we show that the performance upper bounds of LSTM and
Transformer in learning CFL are close: both of them can simulate a stack and
perform stack operation along with state transitions. However, the absence of
forced decomposition leads to the failure of LSTM models to capture the stack

  MHO~1502 is composed of a chain of knots delineating the wiggling jet,
suggesting that the driving source emitted them in an intermittent manner. Our
K-band image of the previously proposed exciting star, IRAC 18064, shows two
sources separated by $\sim240$ AU, hinting at its binarity. However, as IRAC
18064 is located off the jet axis at $\sim2064$ AU, it is questionable as to
whether this source is the true exciting star. Moreover, the orbital model
centred on IRAC 18064 suggests a binary companion at a much greater distance
($\sim2200$ AU) than the nearby star (at $\sim$240 AU). On the other hand, the
orbital model centred on the axis provides the best fits. Nevertheless, the
precession model centred on the axis cannot be discarded, despite having larger
residuals and $\chi^2$. MHO 2147 displays an S-shaped gentle continuous

transiogram. There are different ways to get transiogram models (i.e.,
continuous-lag transiograms) for MCRF simulation based on sample data and
expert knowledge: linear interpolation method, mathematical model joint-fitting
method, and a mixed method of the former two. Two case studies were conducted
to show how simulated results, including optimal prediction maps and simulated
realization maps, would respond to different sets of transiogram models
generated by the three different transiogram jointing modeling methods. Results
show that the three transiogram joint modeling methods are applicable; the MCRF
model is generally not very sensitive to the transiogram models produced by
different methods, especially when sample data are sufficient to generate
reliable experimental transiograms; and the differences between overall
simulation accuracies based on different sets of transiogram models are not
significant. However, some minor classes show obvious improvement in simulation
accuracy when theoretical transiogram models (generated by mathematical model
fitting with expert knowledge) are used for minor classes. In general, this
study indicates that the methods for deriving transiogram models from
experimental transiograms can perform well in conditional simulations of
categorical soil variables when meaningful experimental transiograms can be
estimated. Employing mathematical models for transiogram modeling of minor
classes provides a way to incorporate expert knowledge and improve the

VHE long-term emission has also been observed by the High Altitude Water

unclear. This emission is originated in its prominent jet, which has been
spatially resolved from radio to X-rays. In this paper, we constructed a
spectral energy distribution from radio to gamma rays that is representative of
the non-flaring activity of the source, and in order to explain the observed

state that any reasonable function can be arbitrarily well-approximated by a
network whose parameters are appropriately chosen real numbers. This paper
examines the approximation capabilities of one-bit neural networks -- those
whose nonzero parameters are $\pm a$ for some fixed $a\not=0$. One of our main
theorems shows that for any $f\in C^s([0,1]^d)$ with $\|f\|_\infty<1$ and error
$\varepsilon$, there is a $f_{NN}$ such that
$|f(\boldsymbol{x})-f_{NN}(\boldsymbol{x})|\leq \varepsilon$ for all
$\boldsymbol{x}$ away from the boundary of $[0,1]^d$, and $f_{NN}$ is either
implementable by a $\{\pm 1\}$ quadratic network with $O(\varepsilon^{-2d/s})$
parameters or a $\{\pm \frac 1 2 \}$ ReLU network with
$O(\varepsilon^{-2d/s}\log (1/\varepsilon))$ parameters, as $\varepsilon\to0$.
We establish new approximation results for iterated multivariate Bernstein
operators, error estimates for noise-shaping quantization on the Bernstein
basis, and novel implementation of the Bernstein polynomials by one-bit

0^\circ$) the relatively young stars rotate more rapidly than the old stars, as
found by Hubble Space Telescope in the Milky Way's (MW's) bulge. This behaviour
would be expected also if the MW were unbarred. At larger $|l|$ a different
behaviour emerges. Because younger stars trace a strong bar, their
galactocentric radial motions dominate their $\mu_l$ at $|l| \sim 6^\circ$,
leading to a reversal in the sign of $\left< \mu_l \right>$. This results in a
rotation curve with forbidden velocities (negative $\left< \mu_l \right>$ at
positive longitudes, and positive $\left< \mu_l \right>$ at negative
longitudes). The old stars, instead, trace a much weaker bar and thus their
kinematics are more axisymmetric, resulting in no forbidden velocities. We
develop metrics of the difference in the $\left< \mu_l \right>$ rotation curves
of young and old stars, and forbidden velocities. We use these to predict the
locations where rotation curve reversals can be observed by HST and the Vera
Rubin Telescope. Such measurements would represent support for the amplitude of
the bar being a continuous function of age, as predicted by kinematic
fractionation, in which the bar strength variations are produced purely by
differences in the random motions of stellar populations at bar formation.

potentially ill-posed. Moreover, on local scales the dynamics may enter in the
nonlinear regime, which may lie beyond the range of validity of the infrared
theory. Completions of $k$-essence in the ultraviolet, when they are known to

well-posed at all times, and allow for checking the relation between
nonlinearities and the low energy theory's range of validity. Here, we explore
these issues explicitly by considering an ultraviolet completion to $k$-essence

compared to those obtained with the low-energy theory, and with the low-energy

including skew scattering of phonons by various defects, the coupling of

negative thermal Hall conductivity at all dopings, in both materials. Since
heat conduction perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes is dominated by phonons,
the large thermal Hall conductivity we observe in electron-doped cuprates for a
heat current in that direction must also be due to phonons, as in hole-doped
cuprates. Measurements with a heat current perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes
confirm that phonons are responsible for this thermal Hall signal, as in

$|\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ / $\kappa_{\rm {xx}} |$, where $\kappa_{\rm {xx}}$ is the
longitudinal thermal conductivity, is much larger in the electron-doped

algorithms required for a trajectory-based visual analysis of principal stress
directions, including the automatic seeding of space-filling stress lines,
their extraction using numerical schemes, their mapping to an effective
renderable representation, and rendering options to convey structures with
special mechanical properties. In the design of 3D-TSV, several perceptual
challenges have been addressed when simultaneously visualizing three mutually
orthogonal stress directions via lines. We present a novel algorithm for
generating a space-filling and evenly spaced set of mutually orthogonal lines.
The algorithm further considers the locations of lines to obtain a more regular
appearance, and enables the extraction of a level-of-detail representation with
adjustable sparseness of the trajectories along a certain stress direction. To
convey ambiguities in the orientation of the principal stress directions, the
user can select a combined visualization of two principal directions via
oriented ribbons. Additional depth cues improve the perception of the spatial
relationships between trajectories. 3D-TSV is accessible to end users via a

simply unavailable at state of the art. In this paper, we propose to deploy a

to fulfill the above goal. To monitor such an environment, which usually
evolves slowly, we need to design a strategy for rapid assessment of the
environment over large areas at a low cost. Thus, we propose an integrated
pipeline comprising of data synthesis, deep neural network training and
prediction along with a multi-robot deployment algorithm that monitors
pasturelands intermittently. Specifically, using expert-informed agricultural
data coupled with novel data synthesis in ROS Gazebo, we first propose a new
neural network architecture to learn the spatiotemporal dynamics of the
environment. Such predictions help us to understand pastureland growth patterns
on large scales and make appropriate monitoring decisions for the future. Based
on our predictions, we then design an intermittent multi-robot deployment

other methods, from data synthesis to prediction and planning, to corroborate

Alternatively, sub-picosecond pulses can be synthesized without mode-locking,
by modulating a continuous-wave (CW) single-frequency laser using a cascade of

its simplicity, robustness, and frequency-agility but has been realized only on

single-stage methods and two-stage methods. While the former is more
computationally efficient, the latter usually provides better detection
accuracy. By carefully examining the two-stage approaches, we have found that
if appropriately designed, the first stage can produce accurate box regression.
In this scenario, the second stage mainly rescores the boxes such that the
boxes with better localization get selected. From this observation, we have
devised a single-stage anchor-free network that can fulfill these requirements.
This network, named AFDetV2, extends the previous work by incorporating a
self-calibrated convolution block in the backbone, a keypoint auxiliary
supervision, and an IoU prediction branch in the multi-task head. As a result,
the detection accuracy is drastically boosted in the single-stage. To evaluate
our approach, we have conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset

exception, the results show that with the strengthened backbone and the
rescoring approach, the second stage refinement is no longer needed.

degrees of freedom at the object's boundary. Motivated by recent advancements
in robotic manipulation of deformable objects, this paper addresses these
challenges by constructing a method for automated stability testing of a
slender elastic rod -- a canonical example of a deformable object -- using a
robotic system. We focus on rod configurations with helical centerlines since
the stability of a helical rod can be described using only three parameters,
but experimentally determining the stability requires manipulation of both the
position and orientation at one end of the rod, which is not possible using
traditional experimental methods that only actuate a limited number of degrees
of freedom. Using a recent geometric characterization of stability for helical
rods, we construct and implement a manipulation scheme to explore the space of
stable helices, and we use a vision system to detect the onset of instabilities
within this space. The experimental results obtained by our automated testing
system show good agreement with numerical simulations of elastic rods in
helical configurations. The methods described in this paper lay the groundwork
for automation to grow within the field of experimental mechanics.

  Image Pipelines",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Existing neural networks for computer vision tasks are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: adding imperceptible perturbations to the input images can
fool these methods to make a false prediction on an image that was correctly
predicted without the perturbation. Various defense methods have proposed
image-to-image mapping methods, either including these perturbations in the
training process or removing them in a preprocessing denoising step. In doing
so, existing methods often ignore that the natural RGB images in today's
datasets are not captured but, in fact, recovered from RAW color filter array
captures that are subject to various degradations in the capture. In this work,
we exploit this RAW data distribution as an empirical prior for adversarial
defense. Specifically, we proposed a model-agnostic adversarial defensive
method, which maps the input RGB images to Bayer RAW space and back to output
RGB using a learned camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline to eliminate
potential adversarial patterns. The proposed method acts as an off-the-shelf
preprocessing module and, unlike model-specific adversarial training methods,
does not require adversarial images to train. As a result, the method
generalizes to unseen tasks without additional retraining. Experiments on
large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet, COCO) for different vision tasks (e.g.,
classification, semantic segmentation, object detection) validate that the
method significantly outperforms existing methods across task domains.

systematically captured, high-quality scans. Today, transactions involving
digital documents are more likely to start as mobile phone photo uploads taken
by non-professionals. As such, computer vision for document automation must now
account for documents captured in natural scene contexts. An additional
challenge is that task objectives for document processing can be highly
use-case specific, which makes publicly-available datasets limited in their
utility, while manual data labeling is also costly and poorly translates
between use cases.
  To address these issues we created Sim2Real Docs - a framework for
synthesizing datasets and performing domain randomization of documents in
natural scenes. Sim2Real Docs enables programmatic 3D rendering of documents
using Blender, an open source tool for 3D modeling and ray-traced rendering. By
using rendering that simulates physical interactions of light, geometry,
camera, and background, we synthesize datasets of documents in a natural scene
context. Each render is paired with use-case specific ground truth data
specifying latent characteristics of interest, producing unlimited fit-for-task
training data. The role of machine learning models is then to solve the inverse
problem posed by the rendering pipeline. Such models can be further iterated
upon with real-world data by either fine tuning or making adjustments to domain
randomization parameters.

(asymptotic) rate $R_2(\delta)$ of binary codes with minimum constant
(relative) distance $\delta$. An existential lower bound was given by Gilbert
and Varshamov in the 1950s. On the impossibility side, in the 1970s McEliece,
Rodemich, Rumsey and Welch (MRRW) proved an upper bound by analyzing Delsarte's
linear programs. To date these results remain the best known lower and upper
bounds on $R_2(\delta)$ with no improvement even for the important class of
linear codes. Asymptotically, these bounds differ by an exponential factor in
the blocklength.
  In this work, we introduce a new hierarchy of linear programs (LPs) that
converges to the true size $A^{\text{Lin}}_2(n,d)$ of an optimum linear binary
code (in fact, over any finite field) of a given blocklength $n$ and distance
$d$.
  This hierarchy has several notable features:
  (i) It is a natural generalization of the Delsarte LPs used in the first MRRW
bound.
  (ii) It is a hierarchy of linear programs rather than semi-definite programs
potentially making it more amenable to theoretical analysis.
  (iii) It is complete in the sense that the optimum code size can be retrieved
from level $O(n^2)$.
  (iv) It provides an answer in the form of a hierarchy (in larger dimensional
spaces) to the question of how to cut Delsarte's LP polytopes to approximate
the true size of linear codes.
  We obtain our hierarchy by generalizing the Krawtchouk polynomials and
MacWilliams inequalities to a suitable ""higher-order"" version taking into
account interactions of $\ell$ words. Our method also generalizes to
translation schemes under mild assumptions.

the mean field, quark correlations in the pseudoscalar channel are described

the Mott transition. Supplemented with the vector repulsion and diquark pairing
the model is applied to construct a hybrid quark-hadron EoS of cold

Unfortunately, entanglement is a fragile resource that is quickly degraded by
decoherence effects. In order to generate entanglement for optical
communication, the transmitter and the receiver first prepare entangled
spin-photon pairs locally, and then the photon at the transmitter is sent to
the receiver through an optical fiber or free space. Without feedback, the
transmitter does not know whether the entangled photon has reached the
receiver. The present work introduces a new model of unreliable entanglement
assistance, whereby the communication system operates whether entanglement
assistance is present or not. While the sender is ignorant, the receiver knows
whether the entanglement generation was successful. In the case of a failure,
the receiver decodes less information. In this manner, the effective
transmission rate is adapted according to the assistance status. Regularized
formulas are derived for the classical and quantum capacity regions with
unreliable entanglement assistance, characterizing the tradeoff between the
unassisted rate and the excess rate that can be obtained from entanglement
assistance. It is further established that time division between
entanglement-assisted and unassisted coding strategies is optimal for the
noiseless qubit channel, but can be strictly suboptimal for a noisy channel.

on top of the predeposited H2O ice to mimic the conditions associated with the
beginning of 'rapid' CO freeze-out. Quadrupole mass spectrometry is used to
analyze the gas-phase COM composition following a temperature programmed
desorption. Monte Carlo simulations are used for an astrochemical model
comparing the MM formation efficiency with that of other COMs. Unambiguous
detection of newly formed MM has been possible both in CO+H and H2CO+H
experiments. The resulting abundance of MM with respect to CH3OH is about 0.05,
which is about 6 times less than the value observed toward NGC 6334I and about
3 times less than the value reported for IRAS 16293B. The results of
astrochemical simulations predict a similar value for the MM abundance with
respect to CH3OH factors ranging between 0.06 to 0.03. We find that MM is
formed by co-deposition of CO and H2CO with H atoms through the recombination
of CH2OH and CH3O radicals. In both the experimental and modeling studies, the
efficiency of this channel alone is not sufficient to explain the observed
abundance of MM. These results indicate an incomplete knowledge of the reaction

of a matching whose vertex set induces a disconnected graph. In this paper we
answer this question. In fact, we consider the generalized problem of finding
$c$-disconnected matchings; such matchings are ones whose vertex sets induce
subgraphs with at least $c$ connected components. We show that, for every fixed
$c \geq 2$, this problem is NP-complete even if we restrict the input to
bounded diameter bipartite graphs, while can be solved in polynomial time if $c

NP-complete for chordal graphs, while being solvable in polynomial time for
interval graphs. Finally, we explore the parameterized complexity of the
problem. We present an FPT algorithm under the treewidth parameterization, and
an XP algorithm for graphs with a polynomial number of minimal separators when
parameterized by $c$. We complement these results by showing that, unless NP
$\subseteq$ coNP/poly, the related Induced Matching problem does not admit a

more prominent. This paper presents a novel image denoising algorithm
exploiting such an image-dependent basis inspired by the quantum many-body

The versatile nature of this adaptive basis extends the scope of its

fission takes place through transition-state channels at the barrier tops.
Neverthess, up to now there is no microscopic theory applicable to those
conditions. We suggest that modern reaction theory is suitable for this
purpose, and propose a methodology based on a configuration-interaction
framework using the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM). Simple
reaction-theoretic models are constructed with the Gaussian Overlap
Approximation (GOA) to parameterize both the dynamics within the channels and
their incoherent couplings to states outside the barrier. The physical
characteristics of the channels examined here are their effective bandwidths
and the quality of the coupling to compound-nucleus states as measured by the
transmission factor $T$. We also investigate the spacing of GCM states with
respect to their degree of overlap. We find that a rather coarse mesh provides
an acceptable accuracy for estimating the bandwidths and transmission factors.
The common numerical stability problem in using the GCM is avoided due to the
choice of meshes and the finite bandwidths of the channels. The bandwidths of
the channels are largely controlled by the zero-point energy with respect to
the collective coordinate in the GCM configurations.

torques. The optical torque is traditionally calculated via the flux of total
angular momentum (AM) into a volume enclosing an object. In [Phys. Rev. A 92,
043843 (2015)] a powerful method was suggested to calculate optical torque
separately from the flux of the spin and the orbital parts of optical AM,
providing useful physical insight. However, the method predicted a new type of
dipolar torque dependent on the gradient of the helicity density of the optical
beam, inconsistent with prior torque calculations. In this work we intend to
clarify this discrepancy and clear up the confusion. We re-derive, from first
principles and with detailed derivations, both the traditional dipolar total
torque using total AM flux, and the spin and orbital torque components based on
the corresponding AM contributions, ensuring that their sum agrees with the
total torque. We also test our derived analytical expressions against numerical
integration, with exact agreement. We find that `helicity gradient' torque
terms indeed exist in the spin and orbital components separately, but we
present corrected prefactors, such that upon adding them, they cancel out, and
the `helicity gradient' term vanishes from the total dipolar torque,
reconciling literature results. We also derive the analytical expression of the
quadrupolar torque, showing that it is proportional to the spin of the EM field
gradient, rather than the local EM field spin, as sometimes wrongly assumed in
the literature. We provide examples of counter-intuitive situations where the
spin of the EM field gradient behaves very differently to the local EM spin.
Naively using the local EM field spin leads to wrong predictions of the torque
on large particles with strong contributions of quadrupole and higher-order
multipoles, especially in a structured incident field.

the reliable dual approach which fixes this inconsistency. We suggest to use
two parallel methods based on the transformation of fractional derivatives

method of substitution and choose the proper discretization scheme that fits
the grid points for the by-parts method. The solution is reliable only if both
methods produce the same results. As an additional control tool, the Taylor
series expansion allows to estimate the approximation errors for fractional
derivatives. In order to demonstrate the proposed dual approach, we apply it to
linear, quasilinear and semilinear equations and obtain very good precision of
the results. The provided examples and counterexamples support the necessity to
use the dual approach because either method, used separately, may produce
incorrect results. The order of the exactness is close to the exactness of
fractional derivatives approximations.

the distribution of covariates. Robustness to covariate shifts is important,
for example, when evaluating the external validity of quasi-experimental
results, which are often used as a benchmark for evidence-based policy-making.
I propose a novel scalar robustness metric. This metric measures the magnitude
of the smallest covariate shift needed to invalidate a claim on the policy
effect (for example, $ATE \geq 0$) supported by the quasi-experimental
evidence. My metric links the heterogeneity of policy effects and robustness in
a flexible, nonparametric way and does not require functional form assumptions.
I cast the estimation of the robustness metric as a de-biased GMM problem. This
approach guarantees a parametric convergence rate for the robustness metric
while allowing for machine learning-based estimators of policy effect
heterogeneity (for example, lasso, random forest, boosting, neural nets). I
apply my procedure to the Oregon Health Insurance experiment. I study the
robustness of policy effects estimates of health-care utilization and financial
strain outcomes, relative to a shift in the distribution of context-specific
covariates. Such covariates are likely to differ across US states, making
quantification of robustness an important exercise for adoption of the
insurance policy in states other than Oregon. I find that the effect on
outpatient visits is the most robust among the metrics of health-care
utilization considered.

which the spectral density $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(\mathbf{k})$ has a power-law form

spreadability $\mathcal{S}(\infty)-\mathcal{S}(t)$ for URL packings has nearly
exponential decay at small to intermediate $t$, but transforms to a power-law

an algorithm that accurately extracts large-scale behaviors from diffusion data

accurately the large-scale structural characteristics of a sample Fontainebleau

domain, size, and sparsity. In this work, we address the problem of aligning
incomplete KGs with representation learning. Our KG embedding framework
exploits two feature channels: transitivity-based and proximity-based. The
former captures the consistency constraints between entities via translation
paths, while the latter captures the neighbourhood structure of KGs via
attention guided relation-aware graph neural network. The two feature channels
are jointly learned to exchange important features between the input KGs while
enforcing the output representations of the input KGs in the same embedding
space. Also, we develop a missing links detector that discovers and recovers
the missing links in the input KGs during the training process, which helps
mitigate the incompleteness issue and thus improve the compatibility of the
learned representations. The embeddings then are fused to generate the
alignment result, and the high-confidence matched node pairs are updated to the
pre-aligned supervision data to improve the embeddings gradually. Empirical
results show that our model is more accurate than the SOTA and is robust

stacking geometries of bilayer and trilayer graphene are found to exhibit
robust superconductivity manifesting as zero resistance and Fraunhofer

in the trilayer and quadrilayer arising at finite electric displacement fields,
despite the presence of dispersive bands introduced by additional graphene
layers. Moreover, the three multilayer geometries allow us to identify
universal features in the family of graphene moire structures arising from the
intricate relations between superconducting states, symmetry-breaking
transitions, and van Hove singularities. Remarkably, as the number of layers
increases, superconductivity emerges over a dramatically enhanced
filling-factor range. In particular, in twisted pentalayers, superconductivity
extends well beyond the filling of four electrons per moire unit cell,
demonstrating the non-trivial role of the additional bands. Our results

coherence it evolves according to a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. So
under null measurement the timing of the next quantum jump can change by very
many orders of magnitude when compared to rates obtained by multiplying
lifetimes with occupation probabilities obtained via unitary transformation.
The theory developed in 1987 for atomic fluorescence is here extended to
transitions in transmon qubits. These systems differ from atoms in that they
are read out with a harmonic cavity whose resonance is determined by the state
of the qubit. We extend our analysis of atomic fluorescence to this infinite
level system by treating the cavity as a quantum system. We find that next
photon statistics is highly non exponential and when implemented will enable
faster readout, such as on time scales shorter than the decay time of the
cavity. Commonly used heterodyne measurements are applied on time scales longer
than the cavity lifetime. The overlap between the next photon theory and the
theory of heterodyne measurement which are described according to the

obtained from partial data valid? This paper answers this question by offering
a new asymptotic theory about inference with missing data that is more general
than existing theories. It proves that as the sample size increases and the
extent of missingness decreases, the average-loglikelihood function generated
by partial data and that ignores the missingness mechanism will converge in
probability to that which would have been generated by complete data; and if
the data are Missing at Random, this convergence depends only on sample size.
Thus, inferences from partial data, such as posterior modes, confidence
intervals, likelihood ratios, test statistics, and indeed, all quantities or
features derived from the partial-data loglikelihood function, will be
consistently estimated. Additionally, the missing data mechanism has
asymptotically no effect on parameter estimation and hypothesis testing if the
data are Missing at Random. This adds to previous research which has only
proved the consistency and asymptotic normality of the posterior mode.
Practical implications are discussed, and the theory is illustrated through
simulation using a previous study of International Human Rights Law.

that can act as a medium of transportation for THz radiation. The axisymmetric
structure is capable of supporting hybrid modes with desirable features such as
low propagation loss, uniformly linear polarization and approximately-Gaussian
intensity profile across the iris. A specific application that can benefit from
these features is the transportation of THz undulator radiation over hundreds
of meters to reach the experimental halls at the LCLS facility, SLAC, Stanford.
Such a structure has been modelled before as a boundary-value problem using
Vainstein's impedance boundary condition and assuming infinitely-thin screens.
Given that physical realizations of such screens must have finite thickness and
that the THz wavelength in the 3-15 THz range is expected to be smaller than
convenient screen thicknesses in practice, the question of the impact of finite
screen thickness on propagation performance becomes rather pressing. To address
this question, we present a mode-matching analysis of the structure, with
finite screen thickness and perturbatively clustered (localized) field

seen to lower the attenuation constant on the iris line, which is dominated by
diffraction loss. The propagation loss predictions based on the Vainstein-model
are compared with the numerical results from mode-matching for infinitely-thin
screens, where the former method is observed to agree with the numerical
results better at higher Fresnel numbers (highly-overmoded structures). The
properties of the dominant mode fields are formally derived from first

range of non-semantic transformations. For example, a human can identify a dog
in a picture regardless of the orientation and pose in which it appears. There
is substantial evidence that this kind of invariance can significantly improve
the accuracy and generalization of machine learning models. A common technique
to teach a model geometric invariances is to augment training data with
transformed inputs. However, which invariances are desired for a given
classification task is not always known. Determining an effective data
augmentation policy can require domain expertise or extensive data
pre-processing. Recent efforts like AutoAugment optimize over a parameterized
search space of data augmentation policies to automate the augmentation
process. While AutoAugment and similar methods achieve state-of-the-art
classification accuracy on several common datasets, they are limited to
learning one data augmentation policy. Often times different classes or
features call for different geometric invariances. We introduce Dynamic Network
Augmentation (DNA), which learns input-conditional augmentation policies.
Augmentation parameters in our model are outputs of a neural network and are
implicitly learned as the network weights are updated. Our model allows for
dynamic augmentation policies and performs well on data with geometric
transformations conditional on input features.

of light into a scene and measuring the ToF of the first-arriving photons
directly reflected from a scene surface without any temporal delay. As such,
all photons following this first response are typically considered as unwanted

photons and propose an all-photon ToF imaging method by incorporating the
temporal-polarimetric analysis of first- and late-arriving photons, which
possess rich scene information about its geometry and material. To this end, we
propose a novel temporal-polarimetric reflectance model, an efficient capture
method, and a reconstruction method that exploits the temporal-polarimetric
changes of light reflected by the surface and sub-surface reflection. The
proposed all-photon polarimetric ToF imaging method allows for acquiring depth,
surface normals, and material parameters of a scene by utilizing all photons
captured by the system, whereas conventional ToF imaging only obtains coarse

the long-held spectral boundary of classic EOTs. It is induced by a novel bound
surface state in a Fabry-Perot(F-P) cavity comprising a holey gold film and a
silicon-air interface. By tailoring the cavity length, EOT phenomenon has been
pushed deep into the sub-wavelength region by a factor of as large as 20%, and
EOT frequency comb with cavity function has been achieved. Due to the enhanced
slow-wave effect as the frequency approaches fpl0, the cavity induced EOT
gradually merges with the first order SP EOT. Distinguishing from the classic
EOT phenomenon, no transmission zero is found between these two EOTs, which
dramatically broadens the EOT bandwidth by a factor of 10 at terahertz (THz)

graphene, achieving a large modulation range from 0.5 to 0.25 under a sub-volt

  Gradient","Submitted to L4DC 2022",,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Stability is one of the most fundamental requirements for systems synthesis.
In this paper, we address the stabilization problem for unknown linear systems
via policy gradient (PG) methods. We leverage a key feature of PG for Linear
Quadratic Regulator (LQR), i.e., it drives the policy away from the boundary of
the unstabilizing region along the descent direction, provided with an initial
policy with finite cost. To this end, we discount the LQR cost with a factor,
by adaptively increasing which gradient leads the policy to the stabilizing set
while maintaining a finite cost. Based on the Lyapunov theory, we design an
update rule for the discount factor which can be directly computed from data,
rendering our method purely model-free. Compared to recent work
\citep{perdomo2021stabilizing}, our algorithm allows the policy to be updated
only once for each discount factor. Moreover, the number of sampled
trajectories and simulation time for gradient descent is significantly reduced
to $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\epsilon))$ for the desired accuracy $\epsilon$.
Finally, we conduct simulations on both small-scale and large-scale examples to
show the efficiency of our discount PG method.

Transformers, targeting to the cloud-based image classification application.
Instead of placing an existing Transformer-based image classification model
directly after an image codec, we aim to redesign the Vision Transformer (ViT)
model to perform image classification from the compressed features and
facilitate image compression with the long-term information from the
Transformer. Specifically, we first replace the patchify stem (i.e., image
splitting and embedding) of the ViT model with a lightweight image encoder
modelled by a convolutional neural network. The compressed features generated
by the image encoder are injected convolutional inductive bias and are fed to
the Transformer for image classification bypassing image reconstruction.
Meanwhile, we propose a feature aggregation module to fuse the compressed
features with the selected intermediate features of the Transformer, and feed
the aggregated features to a deconvolutional neural network for image
reconstruction. The aggregated features can obtain the long-term information
from the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer and improve the
compression performance. The rate-distortion-accuracy optimization problem is
finally solved by a two-step training strategy. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in both the image
compression and the classification tasks.

the fluid forces and unsteady vortex patterns. We consider flow past a sphere
to examine the accuracy of our DL-ROM predictions. The proposed methodology
relies on a three-dimensional convolutional recurrent autoencoder network (3D
CRAN) to extract the low-dimensional flow features from full-order snapshots.
The low-dimensional features are evolved in time using a long short-term
memory-based recurrent neural network and reconstructed back to the full-order
as flow voxels. These 3D voxels are introduced as static and uniform query
probes in the point cloud domain to reduce the unstructured mesh complexity
while providing convenience in 3D CRAN training. We analyze a novel procedure
to recover the interface description and the force quantities from the 3D flow
voxels. The 3D CRAN methodology is first applied to an external flow past a
static sphere at a single Reynolds number of Re = 300. We provide an assessment
of the computing requirements in terms of the memory usage, training costs, and
testing times associated with the 3D CRAN framework. Subsequently, variable
Re-based flow information is infused in one 3D CRAN to learn a complicated
symmetry-breaking flow regime (280 < Re < 460) for the flow past a sphere.
Effects of transfer learning are analyzed for training this complicated 3D flow
regime on a relatively smaller time series dataset. The 3D CRAN framework
learns the flow regime nearly 20 times faster than the parallel full-order
model and predicts unsteady flows with an excellent to good accuracy. Based on
the predicted flow fields, the network demonstrates an R2 accuracy of 98.58%
for drag and 76.43% for lift over the sphere in the chosen flow regime. The
proposed framework aligns with the development of a digital twin for 3D
unsteady flow field with variable Re effects.

that charge accumulation (Ni-pSi) is more efficient at actuation than charge
depletion. For a 2 V actuation signal, Ni-pSi capacitors achieve 10 nm
actuation amplitude in square (1.7 $\times$ 1.7 mm) low-stress (~100 MPa) SiN

readmission or even death following the discharge decision. This work
introduces an end-to-end general framework for capturing this trade-off to
recommend optimal discharge timing decisions given a patient's electronic
health records. A data-driven approach is used to derive a parsimonious,
discrete state space representation that captures a patient's physiological
condition. Based on this model and a given cost function, an infinite-horizon
discounted Markov decision process is formulated and solved numerically to
compute an optimal discharge policy, whose value is assessed using off-policy
evaluation strategies. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to
validate the proposed framework using real-life intensive care unit patient

This theory is a self-contained corner of relativistic string theory and has a
string spectrum with a Galilean-invariant dispersion relation. We therefore
refer to such D-branes in nonrelativistic string theory as nonrelativistic
D-branes. We focus on the bosonic fields in spacetime and also couple the
D-branes to general closed string geometry, Kalb-Ramond, and dilaton background
fields. We dualize nonrelativistic D-branes by performing a duality
transformation on the worldvolume U(1) gauge field and uncover novel dual
D-brane actions. This generalizes familiar properties, such as the SL(2,Z)
duality in Type IIB superstring theory and the relation between Type IIA
superstring and M-theory, to nonrelativistic string and M-theory. Moreover, we
generalize the limit of string theory, in which nonrelativistic string theory
arises, to include RR potentials. This stringy limit induces a codimension-two
foliation structure in spacetime. This spacetime geometry is non-Riemannian and
known as string Newton-Cartan geometry. In contrast, nonrelativistic M-theory
that we probe by dualizing D2- and D4-branes in nonrelativistic string theory
arises as a membrane limit of M-theory, and it is coupled to a membrane
Newton-Cartan geometry with a codimension-three foliation structure. We also
discuss T-duality in nonrelativistic string theory and generalize Buscher rules
from earlier work to include RR potentials.

the face detection and gender and age classification functions. The gender
classification error rate for Indian female faces is consistently higher
compared to that of males -- the highest female error rate being 14.68%. In
some cases, this error rate is much higher than that shown by previous studies

node dependency by dividing the graph into several dense communities such that
each of them can be trained with an agent in parallel. Finally, we provide
solutions for all subproblems in the community-based ADMM algorithm.
Preliminary results demonstrate that our proposed community-based ADMM training

attention in 3D vision, leading to many applications in autonomous driving and
robotics. One important yet unsolved issue for learning on point cloud is that
point clouds of the same object can have significant geometric variations if
generated using different procedures or captured using different sensors. These
inconsistencies induce domain gaps such that neural networks trained on one
domain may fail to generalize on others. A typical technique to reduce the
domain gap is to perform adversarial training so that point clouds in the
feature space can align. However, adversarial training is easy to fall into
degenerated local minima, resulting in negative adaptation gains. Here we
propose a simple yet effective method for unsupervised domain adaptation on
point clouds by employing a self-supervised task of learning geometry-aware
implicits, which plays two critical roles in one shot. First, the geometric
information in the point clouds is preserved through the implicit
representations for downstream tasks. More importantly, the domain-specific
variations can be effectively learned away in the implicit space. We also
propose an adaptive strategy to compute unsigned distance fields for arbitrary
point clouds due to the lack of shape models in practice. When combined with a
task loss, the proposed outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain
adaptation methods that rely on adversarial domain alignment and more
complicated self-supervised tasks. Our method is evaluated on both PointDA-10
and GraspNet datasets. The code and trained models will be publicly available.

complicated system with several interactive modular parts. Quantum computing,
as the most generic usage of quantum information, follows a hybrid architecture
so far, namely, quantum algorithms are stored and controlled classically, and
mainly the executions of them are quantum, leading to the so-called quantum
processing units. Such a quantum-classical hybrid is constrained by its
classical ingredients, and cannot reveal the computational power of a fully
quantum computer system as conceived from the beginning of the field. Recently,
the nature of quantum information has been further recognized, such as the
no-programming and no-control theorems, and the unifying understandings of
quantum algorithms and computing models. As a result, in this work we propose a
model of universal quantum computer system, the quantum version of the von
Neumann architecture. It uses ebits (i.e., Bell states) as elements of the
quantum memory unit, and qubits as elements of the quantum control unit and
processing unit. As a digital quantum system, its global configurations can be
viewed as tensor-network states. Its universality is proved by the capability
to execute quantum algorithms based on a program composition scheme via a
universal quantum gate teleportation. It is also protected by the uncertainty
principle, the fundamental law of quantum information, making it quantum-secure
distinct from the classical case. In particular, we introduce a few variants of
quantum circuits, including the tailed, nested, and topological ones, to
characterize the roles of quantum memory and control, which could also be of
independent interest in other contexts. In all, our primary study demonstrates
the manifold power of quantum information and paves the way for the creation of

the set of truly invariant features may not be sufficient for optimal
prediction performance. Such cases arise naturally in networked settings and
hierarchical data-generating models, wherein the IRM performance becomes
suboptimal. To mitigate this failure case, we argue for a partial invariance
framework. The key idea is to introduce flexibility into the IRM framework by
partitioning the environments based on hierarchical differences, while
enforcing invariance locally within the partitions. We motivate this framework
in classification settings with causal distribution shifts across environments.

for generic high-dimensional hierarchical Bayesian inference. MUSE performs
approximate marginalization over arbitrary non-Gaussian latent parameter
spaces, yielding Gaussianized asymptotically unbiased and near-optimal
constraints on global parameters of interest. It is computationally much
cheaper than exact alternatives like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), excelling
on funnel problems which challenge HMC, and does not require any
problem-specific user supervision like other approximate methods such as
Variational Inference or many Simulation-Based Inference methods. MUSE makes
possible the first joint Bayesian estimation of the delensed Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) power spectrum and gravitational lensing potential power
spectrum, demonstrated here on a simulated data set as large as the upcoming
South Pole Telescope 3G 1500 deg$^2$ survey, corresponding to a latent
dimensionality of ${\sim}\,6$ million and of order 100 global bandpower
parameters. On a subset of the problem where an exact but more expensive HMC
solution is feasible, we verify that MUSE yields nearly optimal results. We
also demonstrate that existing spectrum-based forecasting tools which ignore
pixel-masking underestimate predicted error bars by only ${\sim}\,10\%$. This
method is a promising path forward for fast lensing and delensing analyses
which will be necessary for future CMB experiments such as SPT-3G, Simons
Observatory, or CMB-S4, and can complement or supersede existing HMC
approaches. The success of MUSE on this challenging problem strengthens its
case as a generic procedure for a broad class of high-dimensional inference
problems.

analysis that is well known for its lack of annotations. However, aggregating
massive (unlabeled) 3D medical images like computerized tomography (CT) remains
challenging due to its high imaging cost and privacy restrictions. In this
paper, we advocate bringing a wealth of 2D images like chest X-rays as
compensation for the lack of 3D data, aiming to build a universal medical
self-supervised representation learning framework, called UniMiSS. The
following problem is how to break the dimensionality barrier, \ie, making it
possible to perform SSL with both 2D and 3D images? To achieve this, we design
a pyramid U-like medical Transformer (MiT). It is composed of the switchable
patch embedding (SPE) module and Transformers. The SPE module adaptively
switches to either 2D or 3D patch embedding, depending on the input dimension.
The embedded patches are converted into a sequence regardless of their original
dimensions. The Transformers model the long-term dependencies in a
sequence-to-sequence manner, thus enabling UniMiSS to learn representations
from both 2D and 3D images. With the MiT as the backbone, we perform the
UniMiSS in a self-distillation manner. We conduct expensive experiments on six
3D/2D medical image analysis tasks, including segmentation and classification.
The results show that the proposed UniMiSS achieves promising performance on
various downstream tasks, outperforming the ImageNet pre-training and other
advanced SSL counterparts substantially. Code is available at

actively facilitating the deployment of AVs. As a consequence, however, the
need arises for a formal AV road approval procedure. To this end, a safety

The latter involves using driving data to extract AV-relevant traffic
scenarios. The underlying approach is based on decomposition of scenarios into
elementary events, subsequent scenario parametrization, and sampling of the
estimated probability density functions of the scenario parameters to create
test scenarios. The resulting test scenarios are subsequently employed for
virtual testing in a simulation environment and physical testing on a proving
ground and in real life. As a result, the proposed assessment pipeline thus
provides statistically relevant and quantitative measures for the AV

the MTL, we define the Lipschitz modified mean squared error (MSE) loss

modified MSE loss is designed to mitigate the gradient conflict with the NLL
loss by dynamically adjusting its Lipschitz constant. By doing so, the
Lipschitz MSE loss does not disturb the uncertainty estimation of the NLL loss.
The MT-ENet enhances the predictive accuracy of the ENet without losing
uncertainty estimation capability on the synthetic dataset and real-world
benchmarks, including drug-target affinity (DTA) regression. Furthermore, the
MT-ENet shows remarkable calibration and out-of-distribution detection

inseparable or non-LOCC operations, and one can consider a model of gravity

However, we find that a population-preserving CPTP map is inseparable if and

promise unparalleled constraints on how feedback regulates galaxy formation,
and on the small-scale matter power spectrum. Their inner dark-matter densities
can also be used to constrain dark-matter models. In this paper, we present 201
new stellar line-of-sight velocities from the MUSE-Faint survey for the
(ultra-)faint dwarf galaxies Antlia B, Leo T, Hydra II, and Grus 1. Combining
these with literature data, we obtain the tightest constraints to date on their
dark-matter halo masses and inner dark-matter densities. Methods. We use the
Jeans equations implemented in CJAM to model the density profiles and constrain
the presence of dark-matter cores and solitons (a prediction of fuzzy
dark-matter models). Further modelling is done with GravSphere to test the
influence of the choice of modelling tool. We calculate masses, concentrations,
and circular velocities from the profiles, include results for Eridanus 2 from
our previous work, and compare these properties to theoretical scaling
relations, deriving constraints on tidal stripping in the process. Results. We
find that dark-matter cores as large as those of more massive dwarf galaxies
are ruled out for our galaxies (core radius $r_\mathrm{c} <
66$-$95\,\mathrm{pc}$ at the 68% confidence level). We constrain the soliton
radii to $r_\mathrm{sol} < 13$-$112\,\mathrm{pc}$ (68% confidence level). We
find that the galaxies are consistent with not having been significantly
tidally stripped within their half-light radii. The virial masses and
concentrations are sensitive to the choice of dynamical modelling tool:
GravSphere produces results consistent with $M_{200} \sim 10^9\,M_\odot$, as
expected from models in which ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are re-ionization
fossils, while CJAM prefers haloes that are less massive.

for several medical applications, including dynamic angiography. Recently, a
dynamical two-step method has been proposed : first, the water and iodine
projections are computed from the multi-energy sinograms, then, a dynamic image
of the iodine contrast is reconstructed using 4D Total-Variation (TV)
constrained reconstruction from the iodine projections. In contrast to the
2-step methods, one-step methods use a model relating directly the
multi-material images to the multi-energy sinograms. This kind of methods are
well-known to reduce the noise correlation between the material images by
avoiding the intermediate decomposition step, but request to solve an
non-convex large scale optimization problem which can be challenging. In this
work we use the Non-Linear Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method (NL-PDHGM)

This last version is developped to obtain the evolution of the iodine

generated random numbers, which measures the difficulty of guessing the most
likely output. It is difficult to accurately estimate the min-entropy of a
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) source. Hence, NIST
Special Publication (SP) 800-90B adopts ten different min-entropy estimators
and then conservatively selects the minimum value among ten min-entropy
estimates. Among these estimators, the longest repeated substring (LRS)
estimator estimates the collision entropy instead of the min-entropy by
counting the number of repeated substrings. Since the collision entropy is an
upper bound on the min-entropy, the LRS estimator inherently provides
\emph{overestimated} outputs. In this paper, we propose two techniques to
estimate the min-entropy of a non-IID source accurately. The first technique
resolves the overestimation problem by translating the collision entropy into
the min-entropy. Next, we generalize the LRS estimator by adopting the general
R{\'{e}}nyi entropy instead of the collision entropy (i.e., R{\'{e}}nyi entropy
of order two). We show that adopting a higher order can reduce the variance of
min-entropy estimates. By integrating these techniques, we propose a
generalized LRS estimator that effectively resolves the overestimation problem
and provides stable min-entropy estimates. Theoretical analysis and empirical
results support that the proposed generalized LRS estimator improves the
estimation accuracy significantly, which makes it an appealing alternative to
the LRS estimator.

flat stellar discs. The initial mass models chosen are Kuzmin--Toomre discs,
for which two types of exact equilibrium distribution function (DF) are
employed in order to realize different distributions of Toomre's $Q$ values
along the radius. First, the most linearly unstable, global two-armed modes
(MLUGTAMs) of these disc models are determined by numerically solving the
linearized collisionless Boltzmann equation. Next, we carry out $N$-body
simulations whose models are constructed from the DFs adopted above. The latter
simulations unravel that the MLUGTAMs corresponding to those obtained from the
former modal calculations are excited in the early phases of evolution, finally
being deformed into bars in the nonlinear regime by the bar instability. We
show that for simulated bars, the length increases and the axis ratio, in
essence, decreases as the amplitude increases. These correlations are almost
similar to those of the observed bars. In addition, we find that these bar
properties are tightly correlated with the initial typical $Q$ value,
irrespective of the DF. In conclusion, a disc with a smaller typical $Q$ value
produces a bar which is smaller in amplitude, shorter in length and rounder in
shape. This finding might suggest that the Hubble sequence for barred galaxies
is the sequence of decreasing $Q$ from SBa to SBc or SBd. The implied
correlations between the initial typical $Q$ value and each of the bar
properties are discussed on the basis of the characteristics of the MLUGTAMs.

benefit from these hybrid testing approaches. The underlying fundamental
process of cell migration and in particular its dependence on the cell

least two theories explain the migration patterns observed by cells on curved
topographies, involving either polymerization dynamics of actin or assembly
dynamics of focal adhesions. We recently proposed a third mechanism relying on
nucleus mechanosensitivity, which has been tested extensively experimentally
and computationally. We now explore the hypothesis that nucleosensitivity could
be a mechanism for cells to optimally find microenvironments suited for
mitosis, providing mechanical stability and relaxation. By means of a
computational mechanical model with intracellular structure detail, we
investigate how the complex interplay between this new migration mechanism and
the microenvironment topography can lead to more relaxed cells and organelles.
To go further, we simulated in this study cell migration via a novel protocol
in silico which generates dynamical ripple wave on a deformable substrate and
changes topography over time. This kind of in silico protocols based on a new
understanding of cell migration and nucleosensitivity could, therefore, inform

Liu and Weiner [Math. Systems Theory 7 (1973) 185--192]. The argument of Liu

they are still used to store huge amounts of data. Their main interests are a
large capacity and a low price per gigabyte, which come at the cost of a much
larger file access time than on disks. With tapes, finding the right ordering
of multiple file accesses is thus key to performance. Moving the reading head
back and forth along a kilometer long tape has a non-negligible cost and
unnecessary movements thus have to be avoided. However, the optimization of
tape request ordering has then rarely been studied in the scheduling
literature, much less than I/O scheduling on disks. For instance, minimizing
the average service time for several read requests on a linear tape remains an
open question. Therefore, in this paper, we aim at improving the quality of
service experienced by users of tape storage systems, and not only the peak
performance of such systems. To this end, we propose a reasonable
polynomial-time exact algorithm while this problem and simpler variants have
been conjectured NP-hard. We also refine the proposed model by considering
U-turn penalty costs accounting for inherent mechanical accelerations. Then, we
propose low-cost variants of our optimal algorithm by restricting the solution
space, yet still yielding an accurate suboptimal solution. Finally, we compare

order-invariance and modeling dependency to aggregate information. However,
they still suffer from indistinct feature extraction, sensitivity to noise, and
outliers. The reasons are: (1) the adoption of CNNs fails to model global
relations due to their local receptive fields, resulting in extracted features
susceptible to noise; (2) the shallow-wide architecture of Transformers and
lack of positional encoding lead to indistinct feature extraction due to
inefficient information interaction; (3) the omission of geometrical
compatibility leads to inaccurate classification between inliers and outliers.
To address above limitations, a novel full Transformer network for point cloud
registration is proposed, named the Deep Interaction Transformer (DIT), which
incorporates: (1) a Point Cloud Structure Extractor (PSE) to model global
relations and retrieve structural information with Transformer encoders; (2) a
deep-narrow Point Feature Transformer (PFT) to facilitate deep information
interaction across two point clouds with positional encoding, such that
Transformers can establish comprehensive associations and directly learn
relative position between points; (3) a Geometric Matching-based Correspondence

of a minimal quotient for every automaton, obtained by partition refinement.
From a general scheme for the refinement of partitions, two strategies are
considered for the computation of the minimal quotient: the Domain Split and
the Predecesor Class Split algorithms. They correspond respectivly to the
classical Moore and Hopcroft algorithms for the computation of the minimal
quotient of deterministic Boolean automata. We show that these two strategies
yield algorithms with the same quadratic complexity and we study the cases when
the second one can be improved in order to achieve a complexity similar to the
one of Hopcroft algorithm.

Fermi surface is reconstructed. It can occur in the two-dimensional (2D) tilted
Dirac materials when the energy bands change between the type-I phase ($0<t<1$)
and the type-II phase ($t>1$) through the type-III phase ($t=1$), where
different tilts are parametrized by the values of $t$. In order to characterize
the Lifshitz transition therein, we theoretically investigate the longitudinal
optical conductivities (LOCs) in type-I, type-II, and type-III Dirac materials
within linear response theory. In the undoped case, the LOCs are constants
either independent of the tilt parameter in both type-I and type-III phases or
determined by the tilt parameter in the type-II phase. In the doped case, the
LOCs are anisotropic and possess two critical frequencies determined by
$\omega=\omega_1(t)$ and $\omega=\omega_2(t)$, which are also confirmed by the
joint density of state. The tilt parameter and chemical potential can be
extracted from optical experiments by measuring the positions of these two
critical boundaries and their separation
$\Delta\omega(t)=\omega_2(t)-\omega_1(t)$. With increasing the tilting, the
separation becomes larger in the type-I phase whereas smaller in the type-II
phase. The LOCs in the regime of large photon energy are exactly the same as
that in the undoped case. The type of 2D tilted Dirac bands can be determined
by the asymptotic background values, critical boundaries and their separation
in the LOCs. These can therefore be taken as signatures of Lifshitz transition
therein. The results of this work are expected to be qualitatively valid for a
large number of 2D tilted Dirac materials, such as 8-\emph{Pmmn} borophene
monolayer, $\alpha$-SnS$_2$, TaCoTe$_2$, TaIrTe$_4$, and $1T^\prime$ transition
metal dichalcogenides, due to the underlying intrinsic similarities of 2D
tilted Dirac bands.

investigated by means of a network-based representation of their motion. We
employ direct numerical simulations at five different Reynolds numbers, from
$\mathrm{Re}_{\tau}$ = 180 up to $\mathrm{Re}_{\tau}$ = 950, and obtain sets of
particle trajectories via numerical integration. By dividing the channel domain
into wall-normal levels, the motion of particles across these levels is used to
build a time-varying complex network, which is able to capture the transient
phase of the wall-normal mixing process and its dependence on the Reynolds
number, $\mathrm{Re}_{\tau}$. Using network metrics, we observe that the
dispersion of clouds of tracers depends highly on both their wall-normal
starting position and the time elapsed from their release. We identify two main
mechanisms that contribute to the long lasting inhibition of the dispersion of
particles released near the walls. We also show how the relative importance of
these mechanisms varies with the Reynolds number. In particular, at low
$\mathrm{Re}_{\tau}$ the weaker velocity fluctuations appear dominant in
inhibiting dispersion, while at higher Reynolds numbers a larger role is played
by cyclic patterns of motion. At the higher Reynolds numbers employed in this
work, we find that most network properties are Reynolds-independent when scaled
with outer flow variables. Instead, at lower $\mathrm{Re}_{\tau}$, the
aforementioned scaling is not observed. We explore the meaning of the emergence
of this scaling in relation to the features of dispersion and to the network
definition.

of increased activity and instability. Star formation takes place in several
stages during which the star accumulates enough mass to initiate thermonuclear
reactions in the nucleus. A significant percentage of the mass of Sun-like
stars accumulates during periods of increased accretion known as FUor
outbursts. Since we know only about two dozen stars of this type, the study of
each new object is very important for our knowledge. In this paper, we present
data from photometric monitoring on a FUor object V2493 Cyg discovered in 2010.
Our data were obtained in the optical region with BVRI Johnson-Cousins set of
filters during the period from November 2016 to February 2021. The results of
our observations show that during this period no significant changes in the
brightness of the star were registered. We only detect variations with a small
amplitude around the maximum brightness value. Thus, since 2013 V2493 Cyg
remains at its maximum brightness, without a decrease in brightness. Such
photometric behavior is not typical of other stars from FUor type. Usually the
light curves of FUors are asymmetrical, with a very rapid rise and gradual
decline of the brightness. V2493 Cyg remains unique in this respect with a very
rapid rise in brightness and prolonged retention in maximum light. Our period
analysis made for the interval February 2013 - February 2021 reveals a
well-defined period of 914+/-10 days. Such periodicity can be explained by dust
structures remaining from star formation in orbit around the star.

  Distributed Inference under Highly Lossy IoT Networks","Submitted to IEEE Access",,,,"cs.LG cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The distributed inference (DI) framework has gained traction as a technique
for real-time applications empowered by cutting-edge deep machine learning (ML)
on resource-constrained Internet of things (IoT) devices. In DI, computational
tasks are offloaded from the IoT device to the edge server via lossy IoT
networks. However, generally, there is a communication system-level trade-off
between communication latency and reliability; thus, to provide accurate DI
results, a reliable and high-latency communication system is required to be
adapted, which results in non-negligible end-to-end latency of the DI. This
motivated us to improve the trade-off between the communication latency and
accuracy by efforts on ML techniques. Specifically, we have proposed a
communication-oriented model tuning (COMtune), which aims to achieve highly
accurate DI with low-latency but unreliable communication links. In COMtune,
the key idea is to fine-tune the ML model by emulating the effect of unreliable
communication links through the application of the dropout technique. This
enables the DI system to obtain robustness against unreliable communication
links. Our ML experiments revealed that COMtune enables accurate predictions
with low latency and under lossy networks.

aims to explore inherent relationship within human body using a triplet

Self-attention based anchor selection method is designed in the proposed SAP
module for extracting the root point of encoding angular information. By
coupling proposed SAP module with popular spatial-temporal graph neural
networks, e.g. MSG3D, it achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging

to explain neural networks in the context of abnormality localization. However,
from our experiments, they are less suited to classification problems where the
features that allow to distinguish between the different classes are spatially
correlated, scattered and definitely non-trivial. In this paper we thus propose
a new paradigm for better interpretability. To this end we provide the user
with relevant and easily interpretable information so that he can form his own
opinion. We use Disentangled Variational Auto-Encoders which latent
representation is divided into two components: the non-interpretable part and
the disentangled part. The latter accounts for the categorical variables
explicitly representing the different classes of interest. In addition to
providing the class of a given input sample, such a model offers the
possibility to transform the sample from a given class to a sample of another
class, by modifying the value of the categorical variables in the latent
representation. This paves the way to easier interpretation of class
differences. We illustrate the relevance of this approach in the context of
automatic sex determination from hip bones in forensic medicine. The features
encoded by the model, that distinguish the different classes were found to be

imprinted ring lattice in binary polariton condensates, under the influence of
the cross-interaction (CI) between the condensates in different spin components

vortex circulates unidirectionally in optically induced orbits because of the
Magnus force acting in the polariton fluid, and the vortex' angular velocity is
influenced by the SOI and CI. Interestingly, in our system, these two
interactions can also lead to elongated and frozen phase defects, forming a
frozen dark solution with similarity to a dark soliton but with finite size in
both spin components. When the dark solution is stretched further to occupy the
entire orbit of a condensate ring, the phase defect triggers a snake
instability and induces the decay of the dark ring solution. The circulation
direction of a single vortex is determined by the Magnus force. This situation
is more complex for the group motion of multiple vortices because of
significant vortex-antivortex interaction. The collective motion of such vortex
constellations, however, can be determined by the SOI.

we propose a Leaded Gradient Method (LGM) and show the significant effects of
the lagged gradient. More specifically, we re-formulate the gradients to be
aware of the potential dynamic changes of network architectures, so that the
learned attack better ""leads"" the next step than the dynamics-unaware methods

multiple unique extreme space weather events including the third and fourth
greatest geomagnetic storms in the space age. In this article, we review and
analyse original records of Japanese auroral observations around the IGY. These
observations were organised by Masaaki Huruhata in collaboration with
professional observatories and citizen contributors. We have digitised and
documented these source documents, which comprise significant auroral displays
in March 1957 (minimum Dst = -255 nT), September 1957 (minimum Dst = -427 nT),
and February 1958 (minimum Dst = -426 nT). These records allow us to visualise
temporal and spatial evolutions of these auroral displays, reconstruct their
equatorward auroral boundaries down to 41.4{\deg}, 38.3{\deg}, and 33.3{\deg}
in invariant latitudes, and contextualise their occurrences following
contemporary geomagnetic disturbances. Our results have been compared with
significant auroral displays during other extreme space weather events. These
aurorae generally showed reddish colourations occasionally with yellowish rays.
Their colourations are attributed to reddish oxygen emission and its mixture
with greenish oxygen emission. Overall, these archival records provide the
references for future discussions on the auroral activities during the uniquely
intense and extreme space weather events.

scalar product protocol, which enables the dot product of vectors without

scenarios, even though scenarios with a higher number of data parties are
becoming more relevant. For example when performing analyses that require
counting the number of samples which fulfill certain criteria defined across
various sites, such as calculating the information gain at a node in a decision

across an additive white Gaussian channel to a receiver, who in turn sends back
a symbol which is received by the two senders through two independent noisy
Gaussian channels. We consider the case when the feedback is active i.e. the
receiver actively encodes the feedback using a linear state process. We pose
this as a problem of linear sequential coding at the senders and the receiver
to minimize the terminal mean square probability of error at the receiver. This
is an instance of decentralized control with no common information at the
senders and the receiver. In this paper, we construct two linear controllers at
the sender and the receiver. Due to linearity of the policies and the
controllers, all the random variables involved are jointly Gaussian. Moreover,
the corresponding covariance matrix at the receiver of the estimation process
of the senders' messages is a deterministic process, which is a function of the
parameters of the controllers and the strategies of the players, and is thus
perfectly observed by the senders. Based on this observation, we use
deterministic dynamic programming to find the optimal policies and the optimal
linear controllers at both the senders and the receiver. The problem with
passive feedback can be considered as a special case.

correction for supersymmetric black holes can be non-topological in AdS as it
is controlled by additional four-derivative terms other than the Euler density.
The available microscopic data and results in 11d supergravity indicate that

predefined categories. Recently, natural language has been shown to be a
broader and richer source of supervision that provides finer descriptions to
visual concepts than supervised ""gold"" labels. Previous works, such as CLIP,
use InfoNCE loss to train a model to predict the pairing between images and
text captions. CLIP, however, is data hungry and requires more than 400M
image-text pairs for training. The inefficiency can be partially attributed to
the fact that the image-text pairs are noisy. To address this, we propose OTTER
(Optimal TransporT distillation for Efficient zero-shot Recognition), which
uses online entropic optimal transport to find a soft image-text match as
labels for contrastive learning. Based on pretrained image and text encoders,
models trained with OTTER achieve strong performance with only 3M image text
pairs. Compared with InfoNCE loss, label smoothing, and knowledge distillation,
OTTER consistently outperforms these baselines in zero shot evaluation on
Google Open Images (19,958 classes) and multi-labeled ImageNet 10K (10032

Model (SM), which are essential to predict small neutrino masses, relic
abundance of the dark matter (DM) and the measured value of muon anomalous
magnetic moment (muon (g-2)). Models containing quintuplet of fermions
($\Sigma$), along with other scalar multiplets, can address recent anomalies in
the flavor sector while satisfying the constraints from the electroweak
physics. In standard scenarios, the exotic fermions couple with the SM
particles directly and there exists a strong limit on their masses from
collider experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this paper, we
choose a particular scenario where the quintuplet fermions are heavier than the
scalars, which is naturally motivated from the muon (g-2) data. A unique nature
of these models is that they predict non-standard signatures at the colliders
as the quintuplet fermions decay via the scalars once produced at the
colliders. We study these non-standard interactions and provide alternative

systematic enumeration procedure, we show that the region of phase space in
which the high-temperature disordered phase is stable against all modes
representing periodic magnetisation patterns up to a given size is a convex
polytope that can be obtained by solving a standard vertex enumeration problem.
Each face of this polytope corresponds to a set of coupling constants for which
a single set of modes, equivalent up to a symmetry of the lattice, bifurcates
from the disordered solution. While the structure of this polytope is simple in
the halfspace $J_{3}>0$, where the nnnn-interaction is ferromagnetic, it
becomes increasingly complex in the halfspace $J_{3}<0$, where the
antiferromagnetic nnnn-interaction induces strong frustration. We characterize
a few salient properties of these `disorder polytopes' in terms of the geometry
of the space of contributing modes. We then consider the limit
$N\rightarrow\infty$ giving a closed form description of the order-disorder
surface in the thermodynamic limit, which shows that for $J_3 <0$ the emergent
ordered phases will have a `devil's surface'-like mode structure. Finally,
using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that for small periodic systems the
mean-field analysis correctly predicts the dominant modes of the ordered phases
that develop for coupling constants associated with the centroid of the faces
of the disorder polytope.

evolution of the low lying spectra of these isotopes is explained using the
notion of intertwined quantum phase transitions (IQPTs), for which a QPT

involving a shape evolution of each configuration separately (Type I). In our

study employs the nonlinear 3D mean-field dynamo model. We model the emergence
of the BMR on the surface through the nonaxisymmetric magnetic buoyancy effect,
which acts on the large-scale toroidal magnetic field in the upper half of the
convection zone. The nonaxisymmetric magnetic field which results from this
mechanism is shallow. On the surface, the effect of the BMR on the magnetic
field generation is dominant. {However, because of the shallow BMR
distribution, its effect on the global dynamo is less compared to the
convective zone dynamo.} We find that the mean-field $\alpha$ effect, which
acts on the nonaxisymmetric magnetic field of the BMRs, provides the greater
contribution to the dynamo process than the BMR's tilt does. Even so, the
fluctuations of the BMR's tilt lead to the parity braking in the global dynamo.
At the surface the nonaxisymmetric magnetic field, which are generated because
of the BMR's activity, shows a tendency for the bihelical spectrum with the
positive sign for the low $\ell$ modes during the maximum of the magnetic
activity cycle.

of devices are considered, containing either a conventional large single
crystal, or a whisker. We perform numerical simulations for various geometrical
configurations and parameters and make a comparison with experimental data for
the two types of devices. It is demonstrated that the structure and the
geometry of both the superconductor and the electrodes are playing important
roles. In crystal-based devices an overlap between the crystal and the
electrode leads to appearance of a large parasitic capacitance, which shunts
THz emission and prevents impedance matching with open space. The overlap is
avoided in whisker-based devices. Furthermore, the whisker and the electrodes
form a turnstile (crossed-dipole) antenna facilitating good impedance matching.
This leads to more than an order of magnitude enhancement of the radiation
power efficiency in whisker-based, compared to crystal-based devices. These
results are in good agreement with presented experimental data.

the paper involve existing (legacy) self-adaptive architectures and their
adaptation logic, which has been specified by logical rules. We further assume
that there is a need to endow these systems with the ability to learn based on
examples of inputs and expected outputs. One simple option to address such a
need is to replace the reasoning based on logical rules with a neural network.
However, this step brings several problems that often create at least a
temporary regress. The reason is the logical rules typically represent a large
and tested body of domain knowledge, which may be lost if the logical rules are
replaced by a neural network. Further, the black-box nature of generic neural
networks obfuscates how the systems work inside and consequently introduces
more uncertainty. In this paper, we present a method that makes it possible to
endow an existing self-adaptive architectures with the ability to learn using
neural networks, while preserving domain knowledge existing in the logical
rules. We introduce a continuum between the existing rule-based system and a
system based on a generic neural network. We show how to navigate in this
continuum and create a neural network architecture that naturally embeds the
original logical rules and how to gradually scale the learning potential of the
network, thus controlling the uncertainty inherent to all soft computing
models. We showcase and evaluate the approach on representative excerpts from
two larger real-life use cases.

compressed sheaths contribute to the acceleration of particles in the corona

particle energization is still relatively little studied. In particular, the
role of sheaths in accelerating particles when the shock Mach number is low is
a significant open problem. This work seeks to provide new insights on the
internal structure of CME sheaths with regard to energetic particle
enhancements. A good opportunity to achieve this aim was provided by
observations of a sheath made by radially aligned spacecraft at 0.8 and $\sim$
1 AU (Solar Orbiter, Wind, ACE and BepiColombo) on 19-21 April 2020. The sheath
was preceded by a weak shock. Energetic ion enhancements occurred at different
locations within the sheath structure at Solar Orbiter and L1. Magnetic
fluctuation amplitudes at inertial-range scales increased in the sheath
relative to the upstream wind. However, when normalised to the local mean
field, fluctuation amplitudes did not increase significantly; magnetic
compressibility of fluctuation also did not increase. Various substructures
were embedded within the sheath at the different spacecraft, including multiple
heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings and a small-scale flux rope. At L1,
the ion flux enhancement was associated with the HCS crossings, while at Solar
Orbiter, the enhancement occurred within the rope. Substructures that are swept
from the upstream solar wind and compressed in the sheath can act as
particularly effective acceleration sites. A possible acceleration mechanism is
betatron acceleration associated with the small-scale flux rope and the warped
HCS in the sheath.

LCL problems on trees with deterministic complexity $n^{o(1)}$ in the LOCAL

observe that obtaining a greater speed-up than from $n^{o(1)}$ to $\Theta(\log
\log n)$ is conditionally impossible, since the problem of 3-coloring trees,
which is a LCL problem with LOCAL time complexity $n^{o(1)}$, has a conditional
MPC lower bound of $\Omega(\log \log n)$ [Linial, FOCS'87; Ghaffari, Kuhn and
Uitto, FOCS'19]. We emphasize that we solve LCL problems on constant-degree
trees, and that our algorithms are deterministic, component-stable, and work in
the low-space MPC model, where local memory is $O(n^\delta)$ for $\delta \in

  For the high-complexity regime, there are two key ingredients. One is a novel
$O(\log n)$-time tree rooting algorithm, which may be of independent interest.
The other is a novel pointer-chain technique and analysis that allows us to
solve any solvable LCL problem on trees in $O(\log n)$ time. For the
mid-complexity regime, we adapt the approach by Chang and Pettie [FOCS'17], who

seems to be known.
  Here we use the theory of modular Galois representations to prove that for
every prime $\ell\geq 5$, there are infinitely many congruences like Atkin's in
the first natural family which he discovered and that for at least $17/24$ of
the primes $\ell$ there are infinitely many congruences in the second family.

to evaluate the magnitude of fluctuations of the relative yields of neutral and
charged kaons, as well as the relative yields of charged kaons, as a function
of collision centrality and selected kinematic ranges. While the correlator
$\nu_{\rm dyn}[\rm K^+,\rm K^-]$ exhibits a scaling approximately in inverse
proportion of the charged particle multiplicity, $\nu_{\rm dyn}[\rm K_S^0,\rm
K^{\pm}]$ features a significant deviation from such scaling. Within
uncertainties, the value of $\nu_{\rm dyn}[\rm K_S^0,\rm K^{\pm}]$ is
independent of the selected transverse momentum interval, while it exhibits a
pseudorapidity dependence. The results are compared with HIJING, AMPT and

production of disoriented chiral condensates in central Pb-Pb collisions.

at solving a classification problem while observing streaming features of
different dimensions and arising from possibly different distributions. In the
context of social learning, several useful strategies have been developed,
which solve decision making problems through local cooperation across
distributed agents and allow them to learn from streaming data. However,
traditional social learning strategies rely on the fundamental assumption that
each agent has significant prior knowledge of the underlying distribution of
the observations. In this work we overcome this issue by introducing a machine
learning framework that exploits social interactions over a graph, leading to a
fully data-driven solution to the distributed classification problem. In the
proposed social machine learning (SML) strategy, two phases are present: in the
training phase, classifiers are independently trained to generate a belief over
a set of hypotheses using a finite number of training samples; in the
prediction phase, classifiers evaluate streaming unlabeled observations and
share their instantaneous beliefs with neighboring classifiers. We show that
the SML strategy enables the agents to learn consistently under this
highly-heterogeneous setting and allows the network to continue learning even
during the prediction phase when it is deciding on unlabeled samples. The
prediction decisions are used to continually improve performance thereafter in
a manner that is markedly different from most existing static classification
schemes where, following training, the decisions on unlabeled data are not
re-used to improve future performance.

with unknown arm dynamics, where an unknown exogenous global Markov process
governs the rewards distribution of each arm. Under each global state, the
rewards process of each arm evolves according to an unknown Markovian rule,
which is non-identical among different arms. At each time, a player chooses an
arm out of $N$ arms to play, and receives a random reward from a finite set of
reward states. The arms are restless, that is, their local state evolves
regardless of the player's actions. Motivated by recent studies on related RMAB
settings, the regret is defined as the reward loss with respect to a player
that knows the dynamics of the problem, and plays at each time $t$ the arm that
maximizes the expected immediate value. The objective is to develop an
arm-selection policy that minimizes the regret. To that end, we develop the
Learning under Exogenous Markov Process (LEMP) algorithm. We analyze LEMP
theoretically and establish a finite-sample bound on the regret. We show that
LEMP achieves a logarithmic regret order with time. We further analyze LEMP
numerically and present simulation results that support the theoretical

generic theoretical model for evaluating collision rates between molecules and
molecular clusters with intermolecular potentials properly incorporated. The
model requires solely the elementary molecule-molecule potential as a-priori
information but predicts collision rates of molecular clusters at arbitrary
sizes, with an accuracy comparable to all-atom molecular dynamics simulations
we performed for sulfuric acid-dimethylamine clusters, a typical example of
acid-base induced clustering. The carefully devised simulations validate the
theoretical model and elucidate the kinetics of the molecular
collision-sticking process. It is found that the vibrational coupling after the
collision between a sulfuric acid molecule and a sulfuric acid cluster can be
occasionally unsuccessful, i.e., no stable bond is formed after the collision.
However, introducing dimethylamine molecules to the sulfuric acid cluster can
notably increase the probability of forming stable bonds and hence stable
product clusters. The results offer fundamental insights into the initial steps
of molecular clustering and will facilitate the development of efficient
kinetic approach-based nucleation models.

Low-resolution spectra obtained during the primary eclipse -- to our knowledge

companion star is a late K- or early M-type dwarf. Simultaneous modelling of
multi-band photometry and time-resolved radial velocity measurements was then
used to independently determine the parameters of both stars as well as the
orbital period and inclination. The modelling indicates that the companion star
is low mass ($\sim$0.25~M$_\odot$) and has a radius significantly larger than
would be expected for its mass. Furthermore, the effective temperature and
surface gravity of nebular progenitor, as derived by the modelling, do not lie
on single-star post-AGB evolutionary tracks, instead being more consistent with
a post-RGB evolution. However, an accurate determination of the component
masses is challenging. This is principally due to the uncertainty on the locus
of the spectral lines generated by the irradiation of the companion's
atmosphere by the hot primary (used to derive companion star's radial
velocities), as well as the lack of radial velocities of the primary.

  capacity restriction",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This report presents a novel approach to calculate volumes of trains from a
set of requirements describing the transportation demands. The model presented
is based on a multi commodity network flow model. The model comprises three
different layers: the demand level in which the requirements on the transports
are presented, the route layer which describes the routes possible to implement
the demands and the flow layer in which the resulting flows of train volumes
are calculated and distributed over discrete time periods. This structure
corresponds well to other industrial planning processes where different
products or services that are to be accomplished are first decomposed by
methods into different layers of tasks, by e.g. a work breakdown structure
(WBS). Resources are then allocated to the tasks as well as scheduled in time.
The most important feature of the proposed model is that it is volume based,
i.e. volume of trains are handled instead of scheduling individual trains.
Scheduling a timetable is a very complex task, and by concentrating on the
volumes of trains over time rather than the detailed scheduling of them, the
complexity is greatly reduced which is a large computational advantage. The
disadvantage is that the representation of capacity in terms of volumes of
trains with different properties becomes crucial. The report discusses these
advantages and disadvantages as well as gives two examples of the use of the
model.

increasingly important as modern and future High-Performance Computing (HPC)
systems are progressively composed of multisocket and multi-chiplet nodes with
nonuniform memory access latencies. Existing locality-aware scheduling schemes
either require control of the data placement policy for memory-bound tasks or
maximize locality for all classes of computations, resulting in a loss of
potential performance. While such approaches are viable, an adaptive scheduling
strategy is preferred to enhance locality and resource sharing efficiency using
a portable programming scheme. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive
Resource-Moldable Scheduler (ARMS) that dynamically maps a task at runtime to a
partition spanning one or more threads, based on the task and DAG requirements.
The scheduler builds an online platform-independent model for the local and
non-local scheduling costs for each tuple consisting of task type (function)
and task topology (task location within DAG). We evaluate ARMS using
task-parallel versions of SparseLU, 2D Stencil, FMM, and MatMul as examples.
Compared to previous approaches, ARMS achieves up to 3.5x performance gain over
state-of-the-art locality-aware scheduling schemes.

that the span of this ratio among quasars, from 0.015 to 0.2, is the result of
collisional deexcitation as corroborated by Baskin and Laor (2005). However,
the coincidence of the AGN at towards the lowest [O III] ratios, however,
suggests that it represents plasma in the low density regime, where this ratio
can be interpreted as the actual NLR temperature. Using the density indicator
[Ar IV] $4711\AA/4740\AA$ doublet ratio which was observed by Koski (1978) in
Seyfert 2's, we found evidence of relatively low densities ($< 10000/cc$). Even
after considering a powerlaw distribution for the densities as well as a
nonuniform foreground dust extinction, we find no evidence of collisional
deexcitation. The mean NLR OIII temperature we infer for our Seyfert 2 sample

System's giant planets: as their orbits don't match those of their planets,
they are theorised to have formed elsewhere in the Solar System and were
subsequently captured into their observed orbits. Missions such as Cassini have
contributed significant empirical data on irregular moons in the present day
but this paper aims to develop our currently limited theoretical understanding
of their origins and capture as it presents one of the first projects to
connect moon capture with another feature common to all giant planets: ring
systems. As a captured body gravitationally brakes around a ringed planet, it
transfers orbital energy to the planetary system, a process which has been seen
to leave distinctive signatures on the rings which may be used to constrain key
parameters of this interaction, including the trajectory and timing. This paper
presents a project which applies this technique to constrain scenarios for moon
capture through conducting a series of computational simulations using the
Python version of the astrophysical code REBOUND modelling the capture of the
large irregular moon Phoebe by the planet Saturn and Phoebe's effect on
Saturn's ring system. By helping to constrain scenarios for moon capture, this

In recent years, a new type of biosensor based on color centers in diamond

biological systems. Here, we use such a sensor for the \textit{in-vitro}
recording of the local magnetic field generated by tightly focused, high

response and a slow signal component which we seek to explain using a detailed

quantitative description of rupture events, a 1D description is somewhat
limited. We therefore derive a two-dimensional (2D) model which allows us to
investigate characteristics of earthquakes (EQs) and slow slip events (SSEs)
that are only apparent in a second dimension. We find that the leading edge of
an EQ rupture in the direction of the global shear stress (x-direction) is
wider in the plane of the crustal fault (y-direction) than the trailing edge.
The direction of the slip velocity is primarily in the x-direction. EQ ruptures
expand in both the x- and y-directions. In SSEs, the rupture also expands in
both directions for a short period of time, then, after pulses are formed,
there is no further expandsion, i.e., the pulse shape remains practically
unchanged. The 2D simulations show the seismic moment (M) versus time (T)
scaling law may be expressed by the relation , where . For EQs, is
approximately equal to 3, while for SSEs, tends to 1 as the pulses develop and
become fully established. The 2D model quantitatively describes the parameters
of a seismic pulse in episodic tremor and slip (ETS) phenomena and also
explains important features of non-volcanic tremor associated with this pulse,
such as reverse tremor migration. The 2D model confirms the basic findings
obtained previously by the 1D model: (i) The type of a seismic event, EQ or
SSE, and the type of a rupture, crack-like or pulse-like, are determined solely
by the fault strength, the ratio of the shear to normal stress, and the
gradient in this ratio; (ii) The shape of a rupture and position of the maximum

end-to-end optimization of a sequential video codec based on R-D loss averaged

hierarchical, bi-directional coding outperforms sequential compression because
of its ability to use both past and future reference frames. This paper

Our proposed model is akin to a recently proposed Gamma-Gamma model using a
ratio of processes with Gamma marginal distributions, but it possesses a higher
degree of flexibility in its joint tail structure, capturing strong dependence
more easily. We focus on constructions with the following three product
factors, whose different roles ensure their statistical identifiability: a
heavy-tailed spatially-dependent field, a lighter-tailed spatially-constant
field, and another lighter-tailed spatially-independent field. Thanks to the
model's hierarchical formulation, inference may be conveniently performed based
on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We leverage the Metropolis adjusted
Langevin algorithm (MALA) with random block proposals for latent variables, as
well as the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) algorithm for
hyperparameters, in order to fit our proposed model very efficiently in
relatively high spatio-temporal dimensions, while simultaneously censoring
non-threshold exceedances and performing spatial prediction at multiple sites.
The censoring mechanism is applied to the spatially independent component, such

in which the true treatment effect for a principal stratum may not equal zero
even if the two treatments have the same effect at patient level which implies
an equal average treatment effect for the principal stratum. We explain this
phenomenon from the perspective of selection bias. This is an important finding

and Ray's standard family of polarization measures from economics. Agents
evolve by updating their beliefs (opinions) based on an underlying influence
graph, as in the standard DeGroot model for social learning, but under a
confirmation bias; i.e., a discounting of opinions of agents with dissimilar
views. We show that even under this bias polarization eventually vanishes
(converges to zero) if the influence graph is strongly-connected. If the
influence graph is a regular symmetric circulation, we determine the unique
belief value to which all agents converge. Our more insightful result
establishes that, under some natural assumptions, if polarization does not
eventually vanish then either there is a disconnected subgroup of agents, or
some agent influences others more than she is influenced. We also prove that
polarization does not necessarily vanish in weakly-connected graphs under
confirmation bias. Furthermore, we show how our model relates to the classic
DeGroot model for social learning. We illustrate our model with several
simulations of a running example about polarization over vaccines and of other
case studies. The theoretical results and simulations will provide insight into
the phenomenon of polarization.

the power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells (OSCs) have reached
levels suitable for commercial applications. However, the poor operational
stability of high-performance NFA OSCs is a remaining fundamental challenge
that must be addressed. Whilst previous studies have primarily focused on the
NFA component, we consider here the degradation pathways of both the donor and
acceptor materials in the benchmark PM6:Y6 blend. Here, we show that light
soaking greatly increases the energetic disorder and trap state density in PM6,
with little effect on Y6. This is corroborated by electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy, which reveals increased recombination via trapped
polarons on PM6 after light soaking. In addition, ultrafast optical
spectroscopy studies on light-soaked samples show that PM6 singlet excitons are
rapidly converted into interchain polaron pairs on sub-100 fs timescales; this
process outcompetes electron transfer to Y6, significantly reducing the charge
generation yield of the blend. We make similar observations in the parent
polymer, PBDB-T, indicating that this class of donor materials, used in most
high-performance OSCs to date, are intrinsically unstable to light soaking.
Thus, we reveal that the donor polymer can be a further critical weak link in
efficient OSC systems, whose degradation mechanism needs to be addressed
collectively with NFAs.

collection of text documents and has several real-life applications. With the
growth of online text data, numerous summarization models have been proposed
recently. The Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) based neural summarization model
is the most widely used in the summarization field due to its high performance.
This is because semantic information and structure information in the text is
adequately considered when encoding. However, the existing extractive
summarization models pay little attention to and use the central topic
information to assist the generation of summaries, which leads to models not
ensuring the generated summary under the primary topic. A lengthy document can
span several topics, and a single summary cannot do justice to all the topics.
Therefore, the key to generating a high-quality summary is determining the
central topic and building a summary based on it, especially for a long

with this issue. This model effectively combines syntactic-level and
topic-level information to build a comprehensive sentence representation.
Specifically, a neural topic model is added in the neural-based sentence-level

improved by combining the A-net deep learning network with the DWDC algorithm

for exacting structural details of biomolecules, cells and organs from

studies have shown that the maximum speed of wetting/dewetting can be found by
calculating steady solutions of the governing equations and locating the
critical capillary number, $Ca_{\mathrm{crit}}$, above which no steady-state
solution can be found. Below $Ca_{\mathrm{crit}}$, both stable and unstable
steady-state solutions exist and if some appropriate measure of these solutions
is plotted against $Ca$, a fold bifurcation appears where the stable and
unstable branches meet. Interestingly, the significance of this bifurcation
structure to the transient dynamics has yet to be explored. This article
develops a computational model and uses ideas from dynamical systems theory to
show the profound importance of the unstable solutions on the transient
behaviour. By perturbing the stable state by the eigenmodes calculated from a
linear stability analysis it is shown that the unstable branch is responsible
for the eventual dynamical outcomes and that the system can become unstable
when $Ca<Ca_{\mathrm{crit}}$ due to finite amplitude perturbations.
Furthermore, when $Ca>Ca_{\mathrm{crit}}$, we will show that the trajectories
in phase space closely follow the unstable branch.

Perhaps, the most popular first-order method in solving min-max optimization is
the so-called simultaneous (or single-loop) gradient descent-ascent algorithm
due to its simplicity in implementation. However, theoretical guarantees on the
convergence of this algorithm is very sparse since it can diverge even in a

  In this paper, our focus is to characterize the finite-time performance (or
convergence rates) of the continuous-time variant of simultaneous gradient
descent-ascent algorithm. In particular, we derive the rates of convergence of
this method under a number of different conditions on the underlying objective
function, namely, two-sided Polyak-L ojasiewicz (PL), one-sided PL,
nonconvex-strongly concave, and strongly convex-nonconcave conditions. Our
convergence results improve the ones in prior works under the same conditions

singular perturbation theory and coupling Lyapunov functions to address the
time-scale difference and interactions between the gradient descent and ascent
dynamics. Our results on the behavior of continuous-time algorithm may be used
to enhance the convergence properties of its discrete-time counterpart.

far, their potential for high-average-power excitation to reach strong THz
fields at high repetition rates has not been thoroughly investigated. In this
article, we explore the power scaling behavior of tri-layer spintronic emitters
using an Yb-fiber excitation source, delivering an average power of 18.5 W at
400 kHz repetition rate, temporally compressed to a pulse duration of 27 fs. We
confirm that the reflection geometry with back-side cooling is ideally suited

understand limiting mechanisms, we disentangle the effects on THz power
generation by average power and pulse energy, by varying the repetition rate of
the laser. Our results show that the conversion efficiency remains mostly
dependent on the incident fluence in this high-average-power,
high-repetition-rate excitation regime if the emitters are efficiently cooled.
Using these findings, we optimize the conversion efficiency to reach 5e-6 at
highest excitation powers in the back-cooled reflection geometry. Our findings

  We propose Align and Prompt: an efficient and effective video-and-language

video-text contrastive (VTC) loss to align unimodal video-text features at the
instance level, which eases the modeling of cross-modal interactions. Then, we
propose a new visually-grounded pre-training task, prompting entity modeling
(PEM), which aims to learn fine-grained region-entity alignment. To achieve
this, we first introduce an entity prompter module, which is trained with VTC
to produce the similarity between a video crop and text prompts instantiated
with entity names. The PEM task then asks the model to predict the entity
pseudo-labels (i.e~normalized similarity scores) for randomly-selected video

absolutely necessary to enable a signal detection. The collected data also make
it possible to set limits on various models regarding beyond the standard model
physics. These analyses benefit as well from the low background level of
~10d$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$below 1keV and at higher energies. The low background level
is achieved by employing a compact shell-like shield, that was adapted to the
most relevant background sources at the shallow depth location of the
experiment: environmental gamma-radiation and muon-induced secondaries.
Overall, the compact CONUS shield including the active anti-coincidence
muon-veto reduces the background by more than four orders of magnitude. The
remaining background is described with validated Monte Carlo simulations which
include the detector response. It is the first time that a full background
decomposition in germanium operated at reactor-site has been achieved. Next to
remaining muon-induced background, $^{210}$Pb within the shield and cryostat
end caps, cosmogenic activation and air-borne radon are the most relevant
background sources. The reactor-correlated background is negligible within the
shield. The validated background model together with the parameterization of
the noise are used as input to the likelihood analyses of the various physics
cases.

far-from-equilibrium states is still being understood. Recent attention has
focused on how far-from-equilibrium states lead to spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Conversely, ultrafast optical pumping can be used to drastically
change the energy landscape and quench the magnetic order parameter in magnetic
systems. Here, we find a distinct symmetry-dependent ultrafast behaviour by use
of ultrafast x-ray scattering from magnetic patterns with varying degrees of
isotropic and anisotropic symmetry. After pumping with an optical laser, the
scattered intensity reveals a radial shift exclusive to the isotropic component
and exhibits a faster recovery time from quenching for the anisotropic
component. These features arise even when both symmetry components are
concurrently measured, suggesting a correspondence between the excitation and
the magnetic order symmetry. Our results underline the importance of symmetry
as a critical variable to manipulate the magnetic order in the ultrafast

behavioral and textual features from social media interactions and these
features can be passed to a specially designed framework to detect anomalies in
human interactions that are indicators of suicidal intentions. We can achieve

  Imaging Data and Machine Learning",,,,,"cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variation in the local thermal history during the laser powder bed fusion
(LPBF) process in additive manufacturing (AM) can cause microporosity defects.
in-situ sensing has been proposed to monitor the AM process to minimize
defects, but the success requires establishing a quantitative relationship
between the sensing data and the porosity, which is especially challenging for
a large number of variables and computationally costly. In this work, we
develop machine learning (ML) models that can use in-situ thermographic data to
predict the microporosity of LPBF stainless steel materials. This work
considers two identified key features from the thermal histories: the time
above the apparent melting threshold (/tau) and the maximum radiance (T_{max}).
These features are computed, stored for each voxel in the built material, are
used as inputs. The binary state of each voxel, either defective or normal, is
the output. Different ML models are trained and tested for the binary
classification task. In addition to using the thermal features of each voxel to
predict its own state, the thermal features of neighboring voxels are also
included as inputs. This is shown to improve the prediction accuracy, which is
consistent with thermal transport physics around each voxel contributing to its
final state. Among the models trained, the F1 scores on test sets reach above
0.96 for random forests. Feature importance analysis based on the ML models
shows that T_{max}is more important to the voxel state than /tau. The analysis
also finds that the thermal history of the voxels above the present voxel is
more influential than those beneath it.

(XFEM) in the general-purpose commercial software package COMSOL Multiphysics
for multi-field thermo-hydro-mechanical problems in discontinuous porous media.
To this end, an exclusive enrichment strategy is proposed in compliance with
the COMSOL modeling structure. COMSOL modules and physics interfaces are
adopted to take account of the relevant physical processes involved in
thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling analysis, namely: the mechanical deformation,
fluid flow in porous media and heat transfer. Essential changes are made to the
internal variables of the physics interfaces to ensure consistency in the
evaluation of enriched solution fields. The model preprocessing, level-set
updates, coupling of the relevant physics and postprocessing procedures are
performed adopting a coherent utilization of the COMSOL built-in features along
with the COMSOL LiveLink for MATLAB functions. The implementation process,
remedies for the treatment of the enriched zones, XFEM framework setup,
multiphysics coupling, numerical integration and numerical solution strategy
are described in detail. The capabilities and performance of the proposed
approach are investigated by examining several multi-field
thermo-hydro-mechanical simulations involving single/multiple discontinuities
in 2D/3D porous rock settings.

demand for wireless bandwidth in next generation networks. To increase the
spectral efficiency of FSO links, transmission over spatial division
multiplexing (SDM) can be exploited, where orthogonal light beams have to be
shaped according to suitable amplitude, phase, and polarization profiles. In
this work, we show that a programmable photonic circuits, consisting of a
silicon photonic mesh of tunable Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) can be
used as an adaptive multibeam receiver for a FSO communication link. The
circuit can self-configure to simultaneously receive and separate, with
negligible mutual crosstalk, signals carried by orthogonal FSO beams sharing
the same wavelength and polarization. This feature is demonstrated on signal
pairs either arriving at the receiver from orthogonal directions
(direction-diversity) or being shaped according to different orthogonal spatial
modes (mode-diversity), even in the presence of some mixing during propagation.
The performance of programmable mesh as an adaptive multibeam receiver is
assessed by means of data channel transmission at 10 Gbit/s a wavelength of
1550 nm, but the optical bandwidth of the receiver (>40 nm) allows its use at
much higher data rates as well as in wavelength-division multiplexing SDM
communication links.

development, we carry out driver-in-the-loop experiments on a
6-Degree-of-Freedom driving simulator. Based on the analysis of the lane change

selected to describe the driver preferences in lane change decision. Then a
deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach is applied to design human-like
agents for automated lane change decision, with refined reward and loss
functions to capture the driver preferences.The trained RL agents and benchmark
agents are tested in a two-lane highway driving scenario, and by comparing the
agents with the specific drivers at the same initial states of lane change, the
statistics show that the proposed algorithm can guarantee higher consistency of
lane change decision preferences. The driver personalization indicators and the
proposed RL-based lane change decision algorithm are promising to contribute in
automated lane change system developing.
