and type I error calculation and model fitting after incorporating historical
data with the power prior and the normalized power prior for generalized linear
models (GLM). The package accommodates summary level data or subject level data
with covariate information. It supports use of multiple historical datasets as
well as design without historical data. Supported distributions for responses
include normal, binary (Bernoulli/binomial), Poisson and exponential. The power
parameter $a_0$ can be fixed or modeled as random using a normalized power
prior for each of these distributions. In addition, the package supports the
use of arbitrary sampling priors for computing Bayesian power and type I error
rates, and has specific features for GLMs that semi-automatically generate
sampling priors from historical data. Since sample size determination (SSD) for
GLMs is computationally intensive, an approximation method based on asymptotic
theory has been implemented to support applications using the power prior. In
addition to describing the statistical methodology and functions implemented in
the package to enable SSD, we also demonstrate the use of BayesPPD in two
comprehensive case studies.

finite fields and apply them to describe the structure of the so-called weakly
$n$-torsion clean rings. Specifically, we establish that, for any field $F$
with either exactly seven or strictly more than nine elements, each matrix over
$F$ is presentable as a sum of of a tripotent matrix and a $q$-potent matrix if
and only if each element in $F$ is presentable as a sum of a tripotent and a
$q$-potent, whenever $q>1$ is an odd integer. In addition, if $Q$ is a power of
an odd prime and $F$ is a field of odd characteristic, having cardinality
strictly greater than $9$, then, for all $n\geq 1$, the matrix ring
$\mathbb{M}_n(F)$ is weakly $(Q-1)$-torsion clean if and only if $F$ is a
finite field of cardinality $Q$.
  A novel contribution to the ring-theoretical theme of this study is the
classification of finite fields $\FQ$ of odd order in which every element is
the sum of a tripotent and a potent. In this regard, we obtain an expression
for the number of consecutive triples $\gamma-1,\gamma,\gamma+1$ of non-square
elements in $\FQ$; in particular, $\FQ$ contains three consecutive non-square
elements whenever $\FQ$ contains more than 9 elements.

systematic effects of two-body axial currents on Gamow-Teller strength and
$\beta$-decay rates in heavy nuclei within energy-density functional theory.
Using a Skyrme functional and the charge-changing finite amplitude method, we
add the contributions of two-body currents to the usual one-body linear
response in the Gamow-Teller channel, both exactly and though a density-matrix
expansion. The two-body currents, as expected, usually quench both summed
Gamow-Teller strength and decay rates, but by an amount that decreases as the
neutron excess grows. In addition, they can enhance individual low-lying
transitions, leading to decay rates that are quite different from those that an
energy-independent quenching would produce, particularly in neutron-rich
nuclei. We show that both these unexpected effects are related to changes in
the total nucleon density as the number of neutrons increases.

known to be solved by the spectral determinants of a specific family of
anharmonic oscillators called monster potentials (ODE/IM correspondence). These
Bethe Ansatz Equations depend on two parameters, identified with the momentum
and the degree at infinity of the anharmonic oscillators. We provide a complete
classification of the solutions with only real and positive roots -- when the
degree is greater than 2 -- in terms of admissible sequences of holes. In
particular, we prove that admissible sequences of holes are naturally
parameterised by integer partitions, and we prove that they are in one-to-one
correspondence with solutions of the Bethe Ansatz Equations if the momentum is
large enough. Consequently, we deduce that the monster potentials are complete,
in the sense that every solution of the Bethe Ansatz Equations coincides with
the spectrum of a unique monster potential. This essentially (i.e. up to gaps
in the previous literature) proves the ODE/IM correspondence for the Quantum
KdV model/monster potentials -- which was conjectured by Dorey-Tateo and

the theory are needed. The classification of (3,5) and (3,6) distributions
follows as a particular case.
  We then move on to our main example: A complete h-principle for hyperbolic
(4,6) distributions. Even though the associated differential relation fails to
be ample along some principal subspaces, we implement an ""avoidance trick"" to
ensure that these are avoided during convex integration. Using this trick we
provide the first example of a differential relation that is ample in
coordinate directions but not in all directions, answering a question of
Eliashberg and Mishachev.
  This so-called ""avoidance trick"" is part of a general avoidance framework,
which is the main contribution of this article. Given any differential
relation, the framework attempts to produce an associated object called an
""avoidance template"". If this process is successful, we say that the relation

However, in 2D superconducting vortex lattices, the effect of orientational

questions. Here we study a 2D weakly pinned vortex system in amorphous MoGe
films over an extensive range of temperatures ($\bm{T}$) and perpendicular
magnetic fields ($\bm{H}$) using linear and nonlinear transport measurements.
We find that, at low fields, the resistivity obeys the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman

fragile glasses. As $\bm{H}$ increases, $\bm{T_0(H)}$ is suppressed to zero,
and a standard vortex liquid behavior consistent with a $\bm{T=0}$
superconducting transition is observed. Our findings, supported also by
simulations, suggest that the presence of orientational correlations gives rise
to a heterogeneous dynamics responsible for the VFT behavior. The effects of
quenched disorder become dominant at high $\bm{H}$, where a crossover to a

there exists a learner that achieves vanishing average loss for any measurable
response function on this process. When the loss function is unbounded,
Blanchard et al. showed that the only processes admitting strong universal
consistency are those taking a finite number of values almost surely. However,
when the loss function is bounded, the class of processes admitting strong
universal consistency is much richer and its characterization could be
dependent on the response setting (Hanneke). In this paper, we show that this
class of processes is independent from the response setting thereby closing an
open question (Hanneke, Open Problem 3). Specifically, we show that the class
of processes that admit universal online learning is the same for binary
classification as for multiclass classification with countable number of
classes. Consequently, any output setting with bounded loss can be reduced to
binary classification. Our reduction is constructive and practical. Indeed, we
show that the nearest neighbor algorithm is transported by our construction.
For binary classification on a process admitting strong universal learning, we

$N_v$ vectors simultaneously, to ease the memory bandwidth bottleneck. All

portability and flexibility. The lattice volume, $N_x N_y N_z N_t$, the number
of colors, $N_c$, and the number of right-hand sides, $N_v$, are parameters
defined at compile time. Several memory layout options are compared. The code
performs well on modern many-core architectures (480 Gflop/s, 880 Gflop/s, and
780 Gflop/s with $N_v=12$ for the three operators in single precision on a
72-core KNL processor, a $2\times24$-core Skylake node yields similar results).
Explicit run-time tests with CG/BiCGstab inverters confirm that the memory
layout is relevant for the KNL, but less so for the Skylake architecture. The
ancillary code distribution contains all routines, including the single,

a number of important theoretical targets living an order of magnitude beyond
the reach of current CMB constraints. Maps of the large-scale structure of the
universe, in principle, have the raw statistical power to reach these targets,
but the complications of nonlinear evolution are thought to present serious, if
not insurmountable, obstacles to reaching these goals. In this paper, we will
argue that the challenge presented by nonlinear structure formation has been
overstated. The information encoded in primordial non-Gaussianity resides in
nonlocal correlations of the density field at three or more points separated by
cosmological distances. In contrast, nonlinear evolution only alters the
density field locally and cannot create or destroy these long-range
correlations. This locality property of the late-time non-Gaussianity is
obscured in Fourier space and in the standard bispectrum searches for
primordial non-Gaussianity. We therefore propose to measure non-Gaussianity in
the position space maps of the large-scale structure. As a proof of concept, we
study the case of equilateral non-Gaussianity, for which the degeneracy with
late-time nonlinearities is the most severe. We show that a map-level analysis
is capable of breaking this degeneracy and thereby significantly improve the
constraining power over previous estimates. Our findings suggest that
""simulation-based inference"" involving the forward modeling of large-scale
structure maps has the potential to dramatically impact the search for
primordial non-Gaussianity.

network of population flows between cities as a proxy for the communication

indicators that measure economic success. We use several measures of centrality
to rank cities according to their importance in the mobility network, finding
PageRank to be the most effective measure for reflecting these prosperity
indicators. Our analysis reveals that the characterization of the welfare of
cities based on mobility information hinges on their corresponding development
stage. Namely, while network-based predictions of welfare correlate well with
economic indicators in mature cities, for developing urban areas additional
information about the prosperity of their mobility neighborhood is needed. For
these developing cities, those that are connected to sets of mature cities show
markedly better socio-economic indicators than those connected to less mature
cities. We develop a simple generative model for the allocation of population
flows out of a city that balances the costs and benefits of interaction with
other cities that are successful, finding that it provides a strong fit to the
flows observed in the global mobility network and highlights the differences in
flow patterns between developed and developing urban regions. Our results hint

two-dimensional quantum field theories with remarkable properties, including
connections to both string theory and holography beyond $\mathrm{AdS}$

is a kind of new structure, which is neither a local quantum field theory nor a
full-fledged string theory, but which is nonetheless under some analytic
control. On the other hand, supersymmetry is a beautiful extension of
Poincar\'e symmetry which relates bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. It
is natural to ask what one can learn about irrelevant deformations in
supersymmetric quantum field theories.
  In this thesis, we describe a presentation of the $T \overline{T}$
deformation in manifestly supersymmetric settings. We define a
""supercurrent-squared"" operator, which is closely related to $T \overline{T}$,
in any two-dimensional theory with $(0, 1)$, $(1, 1)$, or $(2, 2)$
supersymmetry. This deformation generates a flow equation for the superspace
Lagrangian of the theory, which therefore makes the supersymmetry manifest. In
certain examples, the deformed theories produced by supercurrent-squared are
related to superstring and brane actions, and some of these theories possess
extra non-linearly realized supersymmetries. We then show that $T \overline{T}$
defines a new theory of both abelian and non-abelian gauge fields coupled to
charged matter, which includes models compatible with maximal supersymmetry.
  Most of this thesis is adapted from previous publications. However, the final
chapter presents new results on $T \overline{T}$-like deformations of general

grasping requires a variety of computer vision tasks such as object detection,
segmentation, grasp prediction, pick planning, etc. While significant progress
has been made in leveraging of machine learning for robotic grasping,
particularly with deep learning, a big challenge remains in the need for
large-scale, high-quality RGBD datasets that cover a wide diversity of

inspired by the recent rise in the concept of metaverse, which has greatly
closed the gap between virtual worlds and the physical world. Metaverses allow
us to create digital twins of real-world manufacturing scenarios and to
virtually create different scenarios from which large volumes of data can be
generated for training models. In this paper, we present MetaGraspNet: a
large-scale benchmark dataset for vision-driven robotic grasping via

object detection and segmentation model performance in different grasping
scenarios. We also propose a new layout-weighted performance metric alongside
the dataset for evaluating object detection and segmentation performance in a

existing general-purpose performance metrics. Our benchmark dataset is
available open-source on Kaggle, with the first phase consisting of detailed

recently gained interest in the early universe cosmology. In this scenario, DM
is assumed to be produced from the decaying inflaton through the gravitational
interaction during reheating. Gravitational production from the radiation bath
will be ignored as our analysis shows it to be suppressed for a wide range of
reheating temperatures. Ignoring any other internal parameters except the DM
mass and spin, a particular inflation model such as $\alpha$-attractor, with a
specific scalar spectral index $(n_s)$ has been shown to uniquely fix the dark
matter mass. For fermion type dark matter we found the mass $m_f$ should be
within $(10^4 - 10^{13})$ GeV, and for boson type DM, the mass $m_{s/X}$ turned
out to be within $(10^{-8}-10^{13})$ GeV. Interestingly, if the inflaton
equation of state $\omega_{\phi}\rightarrow 1/3$, the DM mass also approaches
towards unique value, $m_f \sim 10^{10}$ GeV and $m_{s/X} \sim 10^3\,(\,8\times
10^3\,)$ GeV irrespective of the value of $\omega_\phi$. We further analyzed
the phase space distribution $(f_Y)$, and free streaming length
$(\lambda_{fs})$ of these gravitationally produced DM. $f_Y$, which is believed
to encode important information about DM, is shown to contain a characteristic
primary peak at the initial time where the gravitational production is maximum
for both fermion/boson. Apart from this fermionic phase-space distribution
function contains an additional peak near the inflaton and fermion mass
equality ($m_Y=m_\phi$) arising for $\omega_\phi>5/9$. Since dark matter is
produced during the reheating phase, gravitational instability forming
small-scale DM structures during this period will encode those phase space
information and be observed at present. Crucial condition $\lambda_{fs}
<\lambda_{re}$ of forming such a small scale DM structure has been analyzed in
detail.

smoothers. A low-synch modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS)-GMRES algorithm is described
that employs a Neumann series to accelerate the projection step. A corollary to
the backward stability result of Paige et al. (2006) demonstrates that the
truncated Neumann series approximation is sufficient for convergence of GMRES.
The lower triangular solver associated with the correction matrix $T_m = (\: I
+ L_m \:)^{-1}$ may then be replaced by a matrix-vector product with $T_m = I -
L_m$. Next, Neumann series are applied to accelerate the classical
R\""uge-Stuben algebraic multigrid preconditioner using both a polynomial
Gauss-Seidel or incomplete ILU smoother. The sparse triangular solver employed
in these smoothers is replaced by an inner iteration based upon matrix-vector
products. Henrici's departure from normality of the associated iteration
matrices leads to a better understanding of these series. Connections are made
between the (non)normality of the $L$ and $U$ factors and nonlinear stability
analysis, as well as the pseudospectra of the coefficient matrix. Furthermore,
re-orderings that preserve structural symmetry also reduce the departure from
normality of the upper triangular factor and improve the relative residual of
the triangular solves. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on
many-core architectures, the proposed solver and preconditioner are applied to
the pressure continuity equation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
of fluid motion. The pressure solve time is reduced considerably with no change
in the convergence rate and the polynomial Gauss-Seidel smoother is compared
with a Jacobi smoother. Numerical and timing results are presented for
Nalu-Wind and the PeleLM combustion codes, where ILU with iterative triangular

$\left\lceil n(1 - 1/m) \right\rceil$. The upper bound is via an iterative
query algorithm whose core components are the well-known 1-query quantum

  We show a matching lower bound (in fact for arbitrary moduli $m$) via a
variant of the polynomial method [de Wolf, SIAM J. Comput., 32(3), 2003]. This
bound is for the weaker task of deciding whether or not a given $n$-bit input
has Hamming weight 0 modulo $m$, and it holds even in the stronger
non-deterministic quantum query model where an algorithm must have positive
acceptance probability iff its input evaluates to 1. For $m>2$ our lower bound
exceeds $n/2$, beating the best lower bound provable using the general

first design continuous motion representations through the lens of positional

demonstrate that a good generator can be learned by using as few as 2 frames
per clip. After that, we rethink the traditional image + video discriminators
pair and design a holistic discriminator that aggregates temporal information
by simply concatenating frames' features. This decreases the training cost and
provides richer learning signal to the generator, making it possible to train
directly on 1024$^2$ videos for the first time. We build our model on top of
StyleGAN2 and it is just ${\approx}5\%$ more expensive to train at the same
resolution while achieving almost the same image quality. Moreover, our latent
space features similar properties, enabling spatial manipulations that our
method can propagate in time. We can generate arbitrarily long videos at
arbitrary high frame rate, while prior work struggles to generate even 64
frames at a fixed rate. Our model is tested on four modern 256$^2$ and one

  arXiv:2212.06895",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the cornerstone effects in spintronics is spin pumping by dynamical
magnetization that is steadily precessing (around, e.g., the $z$-axis) with
frequency $\omega_0$, due to absorption of low-power microwaves of frequency
$\omega_0$ under the resonance conditions and in the absence of any applied
bias voltage. The two-decades-old ""standard model"" of this effect, based on the
scattering theory of adiabatic quantum pumping, predicts that component
$I^{S_z}$ of spin current vector $\big( I^{S_x}(t),I^{S_y}(t),I^{S_z} \big)
\propto \omega_0$ is time-independent while $I^{S_x}(t)$ and $I^{S_y}(t)$
oscillate harmonically in time with a single frequency $\omega_0$; whereas
pumped charge current is zero $I \equiv 0$ in the same adiabatic $\propto
\omega_0$ limit. Here we employ more general than ""standard model"" approaches,
time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) and Floquet-NEGF, to
predict unforeseen features of spin pumping -- precessing localized magnetic
moments within ferromagnetic metal (FM) or antiferromagnetic metal (AFM), whose
conduction electrons are exposed to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of either
intrinsic or proximity origin, will pump both spin $I^{S_\alpha}(t)$ and charge
$I(t)$ currents. All four of these functions harmonically oscillate in time at
both even an odd integer multiples $N\omega_0$ of the driving frequency
$\omega_0$. The cutoff order of such high-harmonics increases with SOC
strength, reaching $N_\mathrm{max} \simeq 11$ in the chosen-for-demonstration
one-dimensional FM or AFM models. Higher cutoff $N_\mathrm{max} \simeq 25$ can
be achieved in realistic two-dimensional (2D) FM models defined on the

either require quantum phase estimation rendering them impractical for current

quantum algorithms with provable guarantees to prepare thermal states on

correlation physics. Recently, there is great interest in multiorbital systems
where this transition can be restricted to certain orbitals, leading to an
orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP). Theoretically, the OSMP is widely studied
for kinetically decoupled orbitals, but the effect of interorbital hopping
remains unclear. Here, we show how nonlocal interorbital hopping leads to local
hybridization in single-site dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Under fairly
general circumstances, this implies that, at zero temperature, the OSMP,
involving the Mott-insulating state of one orbital, is unstable against
interorbital hopping to different, metallic orbital. We further show that the
coherence scale below which all electrons are itinerant is very small and gets
exponentially suppressed even if the interorbital hopping is not overly small.
Within this framework, the OSMP with interorbital hopping may thus reach down
to extremely low temperatures $T$, but not to $T=0$. Accordingly, it is part of
a coherence-incoherence crossover and not a quantum critical point. We present
analytical arguments supported by numerical results using the numerical
renormalization group as a DMFT impurity solver. We also compare our findings

unique unconstrained vertex at the origin, let $S(t)$ consist of those vertices
which became unconstrained within time $t$ and, for an arbitrary positive
direction $\mathbf x,$ let $v_{\max}(\mathbf x),v_{\min}(\mathbf x )$ be the

spectral gap of the process on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We also analyse the case in
which some of the coordinates of $\mathbf x$ vanish as $q\to 0$. In particular,
for $d=2$ we prove that if $\mathbf x$ approaches one of the two coordinate

minimum value of $1$. For each $N$ such that there is an $N\times N$ Hadamard
matrix, we use cyclotomy to construct an infinite family of codebooks of binary
sequences, in which each codebook has $N-1$ sequences of length $p$, where $p$
runs through the primes with $N\mid p-1$. As $p$ tends to infinity, the demerit
factor of the codebooks tends to $1+1/(6(N-1))$, and the maximum magnitude of
the undesirable correlations (crosscorrelations between distinct sequences and
off-peak autocorrelations) is less than a small constant times
$\sqrt{p}\log(p)$. This construction also generalizes to nonbinary sequences.

two parts: the {\bf algebraic part} to find a minimal set of relations for the

extend the bottom-up holographic models, which we previously introduced to
capture the main features of the non-perturbative dynamics in the Veneziano
limit, by adding fermion fields in the bulk. We identify regions in parameter
space where some fermionic bound states become light, depending in particular
on the number of flavours, the operator scaling dimensions, and the bulk Yukawa
couplings. We also observe a dense spectrum of states, when multi-scale
dynamics is induced by a large backreaction of bulk scalars on the geometry.
Adapting the formalism of the holographic Wilsonian renormalisation group, we
study the linear coupling between the composite and elementary fermions, as a
function of energy scale. We find that, in some circumstances, the associated
operators are dangerously irrelevant: the renormalisation-group flow gives rise
to a large linear coupling in the infrared, even when it is irrelevant from the
point of view of the ultraviolet fixed point. We finally compute the partially
composite spectrum, correlate it with the analysis of the flow, and assess the
potential phenomenological implications, e.g. for the top-quark partners.

at a momentum where the frequency of the fastest hydrodynamic mode becomes
comparable with the decay rate of the slowest non-hydrodynamic mode. Hydro+ was
developed as a framework which extends the range of validity of hydrodynamics
beyond that momentum value. This was achieved through coupling the hydrodynamic
modes to the slowest non-hydrodynamic mode. In this work, analyzing the
spectrum of linear perturbations in Hydro+, we find that a slow mode falls out
of equilibrium if its momentum is greater than a characteristic momentum value.
That characteristic momentum turns out to be set by the branch points of the
dispersion relations. These branch points occur at the critical momenta of
so-called spectral curves and are related to the radius of convergence of the
derivative expansion. The existence of such a characteristic momentum scale
suggests that a particular class of slow modes has no remarkable effect on the

It is still unclear how to integrate DR transportation into current transit

model of a transit system that gets the best from fixed-route and DR
transportation. Our model allows deciding whether to deploy a FR or a DR
feeder, in each sub-region of an urban conurbation and each time of day, and to
redesign the line frequencies and the stop spacing of the main trunk service.
Since such a transit design can adapt to the spatial and temporal variation of
the demand, we call it Adaptive Transit. Numerical results show that, with
respect to conventional transit, Adaptive Transit significantly improves
user-related cost, by drastically reducing access time to the main trunk
service. Such benefits are particularly remarkable in the suburbs. Moreover,
the generalized cost, including agency and user cost, is also reduced. These
findings are also confirmed in scenarios with automated vehicles. Our model can
assist in planning future-generation transit systems, able to improve urban

Exploiting such correlations may increase predictive performance on noisy data;
however, often correlations are not robust (e.g., they may change between
domains, datasets, or applications) and models that exploit them do not

representations which capture different factors of variation in latent
subspaces. A common approach involves minimizing the mutual information between
latent subspaces, such that each encodes a single underlying attribute.
However, this fails when attributes are correlated. We solve this problem by
enforcing independence between subspaces conditioned on the available
attributes, which allows us to remove only dependencies that are not due to the
correlation structure present in the training data. We achieve this via an
adversarial approach to minimize the conditional mutual information (CMI)
between subspaces with respect to categorical variables. We first show
theoretically that CMI minimization is a good objective for robust
disentanglement on linear problems. We then apply our method on real-world

  Tibshirani","Multivariate Trend Filtering for Lattice Data",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study a multivariate version of trend filtering, called Kronecker trend
filtering or KTF, for the case in which the design points form a lattice in $d$
dimensions. KTF is a natural extension of univariate trend filtering (Steidl et
al., 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Tibshirani, 2014), and is defined by minimizing a
penalized least squares problem whose penalty term sums the absolute
(higher-order) differences of the parameter to be estimated along each of the
coordinate directions. The corresponding penalty operator can be written in
terms of Kronecker products of univariate trend filtering penalty operators,
hence the name Kronecker trend filtering. Equivalently, one can view KTF in
terms of an $\ell_1$-penalized basis regression problem where the basis
functions are tensor products of falling factorial functions, a piecewise
polynomial (discrete spline) basis that underlies univariate trend filtering.
  This paper is a unification and extension of the results in Sadhanala et al.
(2016, 2017). We develop a complete set of theoretical results that describe
the behavior of $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ order Kronecker trend filtering in $d$
dimensions, for every $k \geq 0$ and $d \geq 1$. This reveals a number of
interesting phenomena, including the dominance of KTF over linear smoothers in
estimating heterogeneously smooth functions, and a phase transition at
$d=2(k+1)$, a boundary past which (on the high dimension-to-smoothness side)
linear smoothers fail to be consistent entirely. We also leverage recent
results on discrete splines from Tibshirani (2020), in particular, discrete
spline interpolation results that enable us to extend the KTF estimate to any
off-lattice location in constant-time (independent of the size of the lattice
$n$).

onset of quantum chaos can be described as a Fock-space delocalization process,
with the eigenstates of the integrable system being taken as the ""Fock states"".
The integrability-breaking perturbation introduces hopping in this Fock space,
and chaos sets in when this hopping delocalizes the many-body eigenstates in
this space. Depending on the range of the dominant Fock-space hopping,
delocalization can occur either through a crossover, or via a transition that
becomes sharp in the appropriate large-system dynamic limit. In either case,
the perturbation strength at the onset of chaos scales to zero in the usual
thermodynamic limit, with a size-dependence that we estimate analytically and
compute numerically for a few specific models. We also identify two
intermediate finite-size-dependent regimes: There is generally an intermediate
nonchaotic regime in which integrability is broken strongly enough to produce
some system-wide many-body resonances but not enough to thermalize the system.
In spatially extended systems (but not in quantum dots) there is also a
crossover or transition between chaotic regimes where the ratio of the system
size to the mean free path of the quasiparticles of the integrable system is
small versus large compared to unity.

ourselves to the Schwarzschild spacetime. By taking advantage of the
closed-form solution to the geodesic equations in the Schwarzschild metric, we
calculate properties of the self-intersection without numerically evaluating
the geodesic equations or making any post-Newtonian approximations. Our
analytic treatment also facilitates geometric definitions of the orbital
semi-major axis and eccentricity, as opposed to Newtonian formulas which lead
to unphysical results for highly-relativistic orbits. Combined with assumptions
about energy dissipation during the self-intersection shock, our framework
enables the calculation of quantities such as the fraction of material unbound
during the self-intersection shock, and the characteristic semi-major axes and
eccentricities of the material which remains in orbit after the collision. As
an example, we calculate grids of post-intersection properties in stellar and
supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses for disruptions of main sequence stars,
identifying regions where no material is ejected during self intersection (e.g.
SMBH mass $\lesssim 5\times10^6\, {\rm M_\odot}$ for $1\,{\rm M_\odot}$ stars
disrupted at the tidal radius), potentially explaining the TDEs observed by
SGR/eROSITA which are visible in X-rays but not optical wavelengths. We also
identify parameters for which the post-intersection accretion flow has low
eccentricity ($e\lesssim0.6$), and find that the luminosity generated by
self-intersection shocks only agrees with observed trends in the relationship
between light curve decay timescales and peak luminosities over a narrow range

cosmic-rays (CRs) within and beyond our Galaxy lies in the unknown CR
scattering rates, which are primarily determined by wave-particle interaction
at microscopic gyro-resonant scales. The source of the waves for the bulk CR
population is believed to be self-driven by the CR streaming instability
(CRSI), resulting from the streaming of CRs downward a CR pressure gradient.
While a balance between driving by the CRSI and wave damping is expected to
determine wave amplitudes and hence the CR scattering rates, the problem
involves significant scale separation with substantial ambiguities based on
quasi-linear theory (QLT). Here we propose a novel ""streaming box"" framework to
study the CRSI with an imposed CR pressure gradient, enabling first-principle
measurement of the CR scattering rates as a function of environmental
parameters. By employing the magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC)
method with ion-neutral damping, we conduct a series of simulations with
different resolutions and CR pressure gradients and precisely measure the
resulting CR scattering rates in steady state. The measured rates show scalings
consistent with QLT, but with a normalization smaller by a factor of several
than typical estimates based on single-fluid treatment of CRs. A
momentum-by-momentum treatment provides better estimates when integrated over
momentum, but is also subject substantial deviations especially at small
momentum. Our framework thus opens up the path towards providing comprehensive

As a compensation for the
lack of translational symmetry, quasicrystals admit non-crystallographic
symmetries such as 5- and 8-fold rotations in two-dimensional space. It is
originated from the extended crystallography group of high-dimensional lattices
and projection onto the physical space having a finite perpendicular window.
One intriguing question is : How does the translation operation in
high-dimension affect to the quasicrystals as a consequence of the projection?
Here, we answer to this question and prove that a simple translation in
four-dimensional hypercubic lattice completely determines a distinct rotational
symmetry of two-dimensional quasicrystals. In details, by classifying
translations in four-dimensional hypercubic lattice, new types of quasicrystals
with 2,4 and 8-fold rotational symmetries are discussed. It gives us an
important insight that a translation in high-dimensional lattice is intertwined
with a rotational symmetry of the quasicrystals. In addition, regarding to the
multi-frequency driven systems, it provides a unique way to discover new
quasicrystals projected from the high-dimensional Floquet lattice.

reversal symmetry, $C_2$ symmetry to $\pi$ rotation and $C_3$ symmetry to
$2\pi/3$ rotation. In contrast, there are experimental and theoretical
indications that, at certain electron densities, time reversal and $C_2$
symmetries are broken spontaneously, while the $C_3$ symmetry is often broken
due to strain. We show that in-plane orbital magnetization is a very sensitive
probe to the simultaneous breaking of these three symmetries, exhibiting
surprisingly large values (of the order of one Bohr magneton per moir\'{e} unit
cell) for valley polarized states at rather small values of heterostrain. We
attribute these large values to the large magnitude of the characteristic
magnetization of individual Bloch states, which we find to reflect the fast
Dirac velocity of single layer graphene, rather than the slow velocity of the
twisted bilayer. These large values are forced to mutually cancel in
valley-symmetric states, but the cancellation does not occur in
valley-polarized states. Our analysis is carried out both for non-interacting

makes a system quantum as opposed to classical. One seminal notion of
classicality of a quantum system is the existence of a non-contextual hidden
variable model as introduced in the early work by Bell, Kochen and Specker. In
quantum optics, the non-negativity of the Wigner function is a ubiquitous
notion of classicality. In this work we establish an equivalence between these
two concepts. In particular, we show that any non-contextual hidden variable
model for Gaussian quantum optics has an alternative non-negative Wigner
function description. Conversely, it was known that the Wigner representation
provides a non-negative non-contextual description of Gaussian quantum optics.
It follows that contextuality and Wigner negativity are equivalent notions of
non-classicality and equivalent resources for this quantum subtheory. In
particular, both contextuality and Wigner negativity are necessary for a
computational speed-up of quantum Gaussian optics. At the technical level, our
result holds true for any subfamily of Gaussian measurements that include
homodyne measurements, i.e., measurements of standard quadrature observables.

exhibits stable oscillations with perfect revivals when driven close to the
freezing frequencies for initial all spin-down ($|0\rangle$) or Neel

of these oscillations vanish at the freezing frequencies and reduces upon

the number of prejudiced agents in a group. Although prejudiced agents achieve
higher prosperity within prejudiced societies, their presence degrades the
overall prosperity levels of their societies. Our proposed system model can
serve as a basis for promoting a deeper understanding of origins, propagation,
and ramifications of prejudice through rigorous simulative studies grounded in
apt theoretical backgrounds. This can help conduct impactful research on
prominent social issues such as racism, religious discrimination, and unfair
immigrant treatment. This model can also serve as a foundation to study other
socio-psychological phenomena in tandem with prejudice such as the distribution

to extend the widely adopted light-weight Squeeze-Excitation (SE) module to be

use a tunable circularly polarized mid-infrared laser to investigate the
existence of band-to-band excitations using transient reflectivity in an
exfoliated nanoflake and photothermoelectric and photogalvanic signals in a
device. Unpolarized photothermoelectric spectroscopy shows that the absorption
in the Weyl semimetal increases rapidly above 0.3 eV as expected from the
increase in the density of states from DFT calculations. However, the
reflectivity shows a sign change in the circular dichroism of the reflected
light which is dominated by $\sigma^-$ light for energies below 0.5 eV and
$\sigma^+$ light for energies above that energy. Using an intense pulse to
perturb the electrons near the Fermi level, we show that this 0.5 eV energy is
associated with a band-to-band transition from a band slightly below the Fermi
energy to a higher lying empty band. We use spectroscopy of the circular
photogalvanic effect (CPGE) from 0.3 to 1 eV to show a strong peak near 0.5 eV
which lies on top of a two orders-of-magnitude increase at the lowest energies
as the Weyl points are approached. We conclude that this band-to-band optical
transition enhances the Berry Curvature responsible for the CPGE, and may
involve the Weyl points just below the Fermi energy.

the numerical modeling of contact binaries. Using synthetic light curves we are
showing that the starspot-based intrinsic variability increases the apparent
mass ratio by $\Delta q=5$%. For systems with orbital period $P>0.3 d$ the
effect of intrinsic variability averaged over long time cancels each other out
with the Kepler Mission-like phase smearing. Further, we analyse 47 totally
eclipsing Kepler Mission contact binaries. We found a sharp cutoff of the
intrinsic variability at P = 0.45 d. With the light curve numerical modeling
and observational relations we derive physical parameters of the 47 systems. At
least 53% of binaries have a possible third companion. 21 binaries show the
O`Connell effect in the averaged phase curve. 19 of them have a primary maximum
lower than the secondary, suggesting a stationary dark region on the trailing
side. Using the P = 0.45 d cutoff we propose a new approach on the Period-Color
relation. The only parameter correlating with the magnitude of the intrinsic
variability is the apparent effective temperature ratio. We conclude that
instead of describing the system parameters, the A/W-subtype division should be
applicable only to the lightcurves, as a tentative phenomenon.

in porous media. Such a problem can be posed as a partial differential equation
(PDE) in what is commonly referred to as a Buckley-Leverett (B-L) problem. The
B-L problem is a non-linear hyperbolic conservation law that is known to be
notoriously difficult to solve using traditional numerical methods. Here, we
address the forward hyperbolic B-L problem with a nonconvex flux function using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The contributions of this paper are
twofold. First, we present a PINN approach to solve the hyperbolic B-L problem
by embedding the Oleinik entropy condition into the neural network residual. We
do not use a diffusion term (artificial viscosity) in the residual-loss, but we
rely on the strong form of the PDE. Second, we use the Adam optimizer with
residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) algorithm to achieve an ultra-low loss
without weighting. Our solution method can accurately capture the shock-front
and produce an accurate overall solution. We report a L2 validation error of 2
x 10-2 and a L2 loss of 1x 10-6. The proposed method does not require any
additional regularization or weighting of losses to obtain such accurate
solution.

equilibrium (EQ) entropy to nonequilibrium (NEQ) systems so that it can also

by introducing internal variables. These variables capture the irreversibility

entropy becomes a state function, which shares many properties of the EQ
entropy, except for a nonzero irreversible entropy generation. We give both a
thermodynamic and statistical extension of the entropy and prove their
equivalence in all cases by taking an appropriate state space. This provides a
general nonnegative statistical expression of the entropy for any situation. We
use the statistical formulation to prove the second law. We give several
examples to determine the required internal variables, which we then apply to
several cases of interest to calculate the entropy generation. We also provide
a possible explanation for why the entropy in the classical continuum 1-d Tonks

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a procedure for computing a
molecular orbital projector (MOP) basis for use with jmDFT. We demonstrate this
single set of $d^1$ MOPs to be suitable for nearly eliminating all energetic
delocalization error and static correlation error. In all cases, the MOP jmDFT
outperforms AOP jmDFT, and it eliminates most flat plane errors at

estimate expected win percentage using the traditional Pythagorean model, as

Pythagorean model in terms of explanatory power and in terms of
misspecification-based information loss as estimated by the Akaike Information

yields realistic statistical outcomes. The simulation methodology offers the
advantage of greatly improved sample size. As the season is held constant, our
simulation-based statistical inference also allows for estimation and model

threshold mapping reveals a spatially varying $\phi= 5.70\pm 0.03$~eV over a
distribution of (111) textured vicinal grain surfaces prepared by sputter

e.g. vacuum arc initiation, a salient feature of the $\phi$ distribution is
that it is skewed with a long tail to values down to 5.4 eV, i.e. far below the
mean, which is exponentially impactful to field emission via the
Fowler-Nordheim relation. We show that the $\phi$ spatial variation and
distribution can be explained by ensemble variations of granular tilts and
surface slopes via a Smoluchowski smoothing model wherein local $\phi$
variations result from spatially varying densities of electric dipole moments,
intrinsic to atomic steps, that locally modify $\phi$. Atomic step-terrace

support this hypothesis. Autocrats in countries with low-quality institutions
do tend to be wealthy, but typically, they were wealthy before they assumed
power. A plausible explanation, consistent with the data, is that wealthy
individuals in countries with inefficient and corrupt institutions face the
threat of having their wealth appropriated by government, so have the incentive
to use some of their wealth to seek political power to protect the rest of
their wealth from confiscation. While autocrats may use government institutions
to increase their wealth, autocrats in countries with low-quality institutions
tend to be wealthy when they assume power, because wealthy individuals have the
incentive to use their wealth to acquire political power to protect themselves
from a potentially predatory government.

inductively-detected NMR and NQR spectroscopy are not sensitive enough to

center in diamond has shown promise in bringing the analytic power of NMR and
NQR spectroscopy to the nanoscale. However, due to depth-dependent formation
efficiency of the defect centers, noise from surface spins, band bending
effects, and the depth dependence of the nuclear magnetic field, there is
ambiguity regarding the ideal NV depth for surface NMR of
statistically-polarized spins. In this work, we prepared a range of shallow NV
ensemble layer depths and determined the ideal NV depth by performing NMR
spectroscopy on statistically-polarized \fluorine{} in Fomblin oil on the
diamond surface. We found that the measurement time needed to achieve an SNR of
3 using XY8-N noise spectroscopy has a minimum at an NV depth of 5.4 nm. To
demonstrate the sensing capabilities of NV ensembles, we perform NQR
spectroscopy on the \boron{} of hexagonal boron nitride flakes. We compare our
best diamond to previous work with a single NV and find that this ensemble
provides a shorter measurement time with excitation diameters as small as 4
$\mu$m. This analysis provides ideal conditions for further experiments

the formation of banded vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems. Water input,
during rare rainstorms, is modeled as an instantaneous kick to the soil water.
The redistribution, from surface water to soil moisture, accounts for the
impact of vegetation on infiltration rate and downslope overland flow speed.
These two positive feedbacks between water and biomass distributions act on the
fast timescales of rain storms. During dry periods, a classic
reaction-diffusion framework is used for the slow processes associated with
soil water and biomass. This pulsed precipitation model predicts that the
preferred spacing of the vegetation bands is determined by the characteristic
distance that a storm pulse of water travels overland before infiltrating into
the soil. In this way, the vegetation pattern is determined by the fast
ecohydrological processes and may be attuned with its dryland precipitation
pattern. We demonstrate how this modeling framework, suited for stochastic rain
inputs, can be used to investigate possible collapse of a dryland
pattern-forming ecosystem under different precipitation patterns with identical
low annual mean. Model simulations suggest, for instance, that shorter rainy
seasons and greater variability in storm depth may both hasten ecosystem
collapse.

Riemann surfaces with marked points which behave naturally under gluing of

fundamental role in the theory of random surfaces and two dimensional quantum
gravity. Then we use Segal's axioms to express the correlation functions of

structure constants}, determined in earlier works by the authors. As a
consequence, we obtain a formula for the correlation functions as multiple
integrals over the spectrum of LCFT, the structure of these integrals being
associated to a pant decomposition of the surface. The integrand is the modulus
squared of a function called conformal block: its structure is encoded by the
commutation relations of an algebra of operators called the Virasoro algebra

learning, have been recently proposed for the Statistical Process Control (SPC)
of a sequence of manufactured parts, whose 3-dimensional metrology is acquired
with non-contact sensors. These techniques provide an {\em intrinsic} solution
to the SPC problem, that is, a solution exclusively based on measurements on
the scanned surfaces or 2-manifolds without making reference to their ambient
space. These methods, therefore, avoid the computationally expensive,
non-convex registration step needed to align the parts, as required by previous
methods for SPC based on 3-dimensional measurements. Once a SPC mechanism
triggers and out-of-control alarm, however, an additional problem remains: that
of locating where on the surface of the part that triggered the SPC alarm there
is a significant shape difference with respect to either an in-control part or
its nominal (CAD) design. In the past, only registration-based solutions
existed for this problem. In this paper, we present a new registration-free
solution to the part localization problem. Our approach uses a functional map
between the manifolds to be compared, that is, a map between functions defined
on each manifold based on intrinsic differential operators, in particular, the
Laplace-Beltrami operator, in order to construct a point to point mapping
between the two manifolds and be able to locate defects on the suspected part.
A recursive partitioning algorithm is presented to define a region of interest
on the surface of the part where defects are likely to occur, which results in
considerable computational advantages. The functional map method involves a
very large number of point-to-point comparisons based on noisy measurements,
and a statistical thresholding method is presented to filter the false
positives in the underlying massive multiple comparisons problem.

social networks, communication networks, and financial transaction networks. In
such networks, temporal motifs, which are repeated sequences of time-stamped
edges/transactions, offer valuable information about the networks' evolution
and function. However, currently no analytical models for temporal graphs exist
and there are no models that would allow for scalable modeling of temporal
motif frequencies over time. Here, we develop the Temporal Activity State Block
Model (TASBM), to model temporal motifs in temporal graphs. We develop
efficient model fitting methods and derive closed-form expressions for the
expected motif frequencies and their variances in a given temporal network,
thus enabling the discovery of statistically significant temporal motifs. Our
TASMB framework can accurately track the changes in the expected motif
frequencies over time, and also scales well to networks with tens of millions
of edges/transactions as it does not require time-consuming generation of many
random temporal networks and then computing motif counts for each one of them.
We show that TASBM is able to model changes in temporal activity over time in a
network of financial transactions, a phone call, and an email network.
Additionally, we show that deviations from the expected motif counts calculated
by our analytical framework correspond to anomalies in the financial
transactions and phone call networks.

complicated tasks or functions is their universal property. Though the past few
decades have seen tremendous advances in theories of neural networks, a single
constructive framework for neural network universality remains unavailable.
This paper is the first effort to provide a unified and constructive framework
for the universality of a large class of activation functions including most of
existing ones. At the heart of the framework is the concept of neural network
approximate identity (nAI). The main result is: {\em any nAI activation
function is universal}. It turns out that most of existing activation functions
are nAI, and thus universal in the space of continuous functions on compacta.
The framework induces {\bf several advantages} over the contemporary
counterparts. First, it is constructive with elementary means from functional
analysis, probability theory, and numerical analysis. Second, it is the first
unified attempt that is valid for most of existing activation functions. Third,
as a by product, the framework provides the first universality proof for some
of the existing activation functions including Mish, SiLU, ELU, GELU, and etc.
Fourth, it provides new proofs for most activation functions. Fifth, it
discovers new activation functions with guaranteed universality property.
Sixth, for a given activation and error tolerance, the framework provides
precisely the architecture of the corresponding one-hidden neural network with
predetermined number of neurons, and the values of weights/biases. Seventh, the
framework allows us to abstractly present the first universal approximation
with favorable non-asymptotic rate.

transport (MFT) has been developed to identify reconnection activity in
turbulent plasmas. This method is applied to a gyrokinetic simulation of
two-dimensional (2D) plasma turbulence. Results on the identification of three
active reconnection X-points are reported. The first two X-points have
developed bi-directional electron outflow jets. Beyond the category of
electron-only reconnection, the third X-point does not have bi-directional
electron outflow jets because the flow is modified by turbulence. In all cases,
this method successfully identifies active reconnection through clear inward
and outward flux transport around the X-points. This transport pattern defines
reconnection and produces a new quadrupolar structure in the divergence of MFT.
This method is expected to be applicable to spacecraft missions such as MMS,
Parker Solar Probe, and Solar Orbiter.

against unknown pathogens by discriminating between host and foreign material.
This discriminatory capability is achieved by the creation of a repertoire of
cells each carrying a T cell receptor (TCR) specific to non-self antigens

understanding of the dynamics of the adaptive immune system at a repertoire
level is complex, due to both the nuanced interaction of a TCR-pMHC pair and to
the number of different possible TCR-pMHC pairings, making computationally
exact solutions currently unfeasible. To gain some insight into this problem,
we study an affinity-based model for TCR-pMHC binding in which a crystal
structure is used to generate a distance-based contact map that weights the
pairwise amino acid interactions. We find that the TCR-pMHC binding energy
distribution strongly depends both on the number of contacts and the repeat
structure allowed by the topology of the contact map of choice; this in turn
influences T cell recognition probability during negative selection, with
higher variances leading to higher survival probabilities. In addition, we
quantify the degree to which neoantigens with mutations in sites with higher

However,
quantifying its value is difficult. Various types of exoskeleton robots have
already been developed and tested for upper limb rehabilitation but,
evaluations are not standardized, particularly in pediatric rehabilitation.
This paper proposes a methodology for the quantitative evaluation of upper limb
exoskeletons that, like a test bench, would serve for replicable testing. We
determined the range of motion (ROM) and joint torques using both kinematic
modeling and experimental measurements (using sensors integrated into Dynamixel
actuators). The proposed test bench can provide an accurate range of motion
(ROM) and joint torques during the pronation-supination (PS) task. The range of
motion obtained with the physical prototype was approximately 156.26 +-
4.71{\deg} during the PS task, while it was approximately 146.84 +- 14.32{\deg}
for the multibody model. The results show that the average range of
experimental torques (0.28 +- 0.06 N.m) was overestimated by 40% and just 3.4%,
respectively, when compared to the average range of simulated torques (0.2 +-
0.05 N.m) and to the highest range of simulated torques (0.29 N.m). For the
experimental measurements, test-retest reliability was excellent (0.96-0.98)
within sessions and excellent (0.93) or good (0.81-0.86) between sessions.
Finally, the suggested approach provides a ROM close to the normal ROM
necessary during PS tasks. These results validate the measurements' accuracy
and underline the proposed methodology's relevance. The proposed test bench
could become a reference standard for evaluating exoskeletons. This study also
addresses a methodological aspect on the accurate assessment of joint torques
that can serve in applications such as the sizing of actuators in exoskeletons
or the non-invasive evaluation of muscle forces in the human body.

minimum of solar activity between cycles 23 and 24. In this period, more than
200 billion showers were recorded with energies between 1 and 30 TeV. The
observed two-dimensional distribution of cosmic rays is characterized by two
wide regions of excess and deficit, respectively, both of relative intensity
0.001 with respect to a uniform flux, superimposed on smaller size structures.
The harmonic analysis shows that the large-scale cosmic-ray relative intensity
as a function of R.A. can be described by the first and second terms of a
Fouries series. The high event statistics allow the study of the energy
dependence of the anistropy, showing that the amplitude increases with energy,
with a maximum intensity at 10 TeV, and then decreases while the phase slowly
shifts toward lower values of R.A. with increasing energy. The ARGO-YBJ data
provide accurate observations over more than a decade of energy around this
feature of the anisotropy spectrum.

intra-domain experiments, their effects drop severely in cross-domain scenarios
because of poor generalization. Recently, multifarious techniques have been
explored, such as domain generalization and representation disentanglement.
However, the improvement is still limited by two issues: 1) It is difficult to
perfectly map all faces to a shared feature space. If faces from unknown
domains are not mapped to the known region in the shared feature space,
accidentally inaccurate predictions will be obtained. 2) It is hard to
completely consider various spoof traces for disentanglement. In this paper, we
propose a Feature Generation and Hypothesis Verification framework to alleviate
the two issues. Above all, feature generation networks which generate
hypotheses of real faces and known attacks are introduced for the first time in
the FAS task. Subsequently, two hypothesis verification modules are applied to
judge whether the input face comes from the real-face space and the real-face
distribution respectively. Furthermore, some analyses of the relationship
between our framework and Bayesian uncertainty estimation are given, which
provides theoretical support for reliable defense in unknown domains.
Experimental results show our framework achieves promising results and
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on extensive public datasets.

emerge in many important applications. These applications can often be cast
into standard graph learning tasks, in which a crucial step is to learn
low-dimensional graph representations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are
currently the most popular model in graph embedding approaches. However,
standard GNNs in the neighborhood aggregation paradigm suffer from limited
discriminative power in distinguishing \emph{high-order} graph structures as
opposed to \emph{low-order} structures. To capture high-order structures,
researchers have resorted to motifs and developed motif-based GNNs. However,
existing motif-based GNNs still often suffer from less discriminative power on
high-order structures. To overcome the above limitations, we propose Motif
Graph Neural Network (MGNN), a novel framework to better capture high-order
structures, hinging on our proposed motif redundancy minimization operator and
injective motif combination. First, MGNN produces a set of node representations
w.r.t. each motif. The next phase is our proposed redundancy minimization among
motifs which compares the motifs with each other and distills the features
unique to each motif. Finally, MGNN performs the updating of node
representations by combining multiple representations from different motifs. In
particular, to enhance the discriminative power, MGNN utilizes an injective
function to combine the representations w.r.t. different motifs. We further
show that our proposed architecture increases the expressive power of GNNs with
a theoretical analysis. We demonstrate that MGNN outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on seven public benchmarks on both node classification and graph
classification tasks.

online when the offline information is neither accessible nor time-invariant.
Stability and convergence of these adaptive regulators are challenging,

dressed, fully field-dependent Kobayashi-Maskawa--'t Hooft (KMT) anomaly
coupling is computed. It is found that mesonic fluctuations strengthen this
signature of the $U_A(1)$ breaking as the temperature increases. On the other
hand, when instanton effects are included by parametrizing the explicit
temperature dependence of the bare anomaly parameter in consistency with the
semiclassical result for the tunneling amplitude, a natural tendency appears
diminishing the anomaly at high temperatures. As a result of the two competing
effects, the dressed KMT coupling shows a well-defined intermediate
strengthening behavior around the chiral (pseudo)transition temperature before
the axial anomaly gets fully suppressed at high temperature. As a consequence,
we conclude that below $T \sim 200 \MeV$ the $U_A(1)$ anomaly is unlikely to be
effectively restored. Robustness of the conclusions against different
assumptions for the temperature dependence of the bare anomaly coefficient is
investigated in detail.

reaction systems possess various structures, which can be utilized to
characterize important physical properties of the systems. In this work, we
reveal the Hessian geometry which underlies chemical reaction systems and
demonstrate how it originates from the interplay of stoichiometric and
thermodynamic constraints. Our derivation is based on kinetics, we assume the
law of mass action and characterize the equilibrium states by the detailed
balance condition. The obtained geometric structure is then related to
thermodynamics via the Hessian geometry appearing in a pure thermodynamic
derivation. We demonstrate, based on the fact that both equilibrium and complex
balanced states form toric varieties, how the Hessian geometric framework can
be extended to nonequilibrium complex balanced steady states. We conclude that
Hessian geometry provides a natural framework to capture the thermodynamic

intervals on the filtering errors. Then, we account for filtering errors and
derive sufficient conditions on the control input based on the estimated states
to bound the probability that the real states of the system enter an unsafe

are linear constraints on the control input, and, hence, they can be used in
tractable optimization problems to achieve safety, in addition to other

necessary to make a clean-slate design for the satellite transport layer. This
paper introduces a novel Information-centric Hop-by-Hop transport layer design,
INTCP. It carries out hop-by-hop packets retransmission and hop-by-hop
congestion control with the help of cache and request-response model.
Hop-by-hop retransmission recovers lost packets on hop, reduces retransmission
delay. INTCP controls traffic and congestion also by hop. Each hop tries its
best to maximize its bandwidth utilization and improves end-to-end throughput.
The capability of caching enables asynchronous multicast in transport layer.
This would save precious spectrum resources in the satellite network. The
performance of INTCP is evaluated with the simulated Starlink constellation.
Long-distance communication with more than 1000km is carried out. The results
demonstrate that, for the unicast scenario INTCP could reduce 42% one-way

galaxies depends on galaxy morphology and azimuthal angle using mock
observations generated from the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. By
creating mock stacks of {\it eROSITA}-observed galaxies oriented to be edge-on,
we make several observationally-testable predictions for galaxies in the
stellar mass range $M_\star=10^{10.7-11.2}\;$M$_{\odot}$. The soft X-ray CGM of
disc galaxies is between 60 and 100\% brighter along the semi-major axis
compared to the semi-minor axis, between 10-30 kpc. This azimuthal dependence
is a consequence of the hot ($T>10^6$ K) CGM being non-spherical: specifically
it is flattened along the minor axis such that denser and more luminous gas
resides in the disc plane and co-rotates with the galaxy. Outflows enrich and
heat the CGM preferentially perpendicular to the disc, but we do not find an
observationally-detectable signature along the semi-minor axis. Spheroidal
galaxies have hotter CGMs than disc galaxies related to spheroids residing at
higher halos masses, which may be measurable through hardness ratios spanning
the $0.2-1.5$ keV band. While spheroids appear to have brighter CGMs than discs
for the selected fixed $M_\star$ bin, this owes to spheroids having higher
stellar and halo masses within that $M_\star$ bin, and obscures the fact that
both simulated populations have similar total CGM luminosities at the exact
same $M_\star$. Discs have brighter emission inside 20 kpc and more steeply
declining profiles with radius than spheroids. We predict that the {\it
eROSITA} 4-year all-sky survey should detect many of the signatures we predict
here, although targeted follow-up observations of highly inclined nearby discs
after the survey may be necessary to observe some of our azimuthally-dependent
predictions.

propose a method based on statistics and machine learning for the spatial
prediction of extreme wildfire frequencies and sizes. This method is tailored
to handle large datasets, including missing observations. Our approach relies
on a four-stage high-dimensional bivariate sparse spatial model for
zero-inflated data, which is developed using stochastic partial differential
equations(SPDE). In Stage 1, the observations are categorized in zero/nonzero
categories and are modeled using a two-layered hierarchical Bayesian sparse
spatial model to estimate the probabilities of these two categories. In Stage
2, before modeling the positive observations using spatially-varying
coefficients, smoothed parameter surfaces are obtained from empirical estimates
using fixed rank kriging. This approximate Bayesian method inference was
employed to avoid the high computational burden of large spatial data modeling
using spatially-varying coefficients. In Stage 3, the standardized
log-transformed positive observations from the second stage are further modeled
using a sparse bivariate spatial Gaussian process. The Gaussian distribution
assumption for wildfire counts developed in the third stage is computationally
effective but erroneous. Thus in Stage 4, the predicted values are rectified
using Random Forests. The posterior inference is drawn for Stages 1 and 3 using
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. A cross-validation scheme is then
created for the artificially generated gaps, and the EVA 2021 prediction scores
of the proposed model are compared to those obtained using certain natural
competitors.

Specifically, we consider how users with limited access to an image database
can retrieve images using their own black-box functions. This formulation
enables a flexible and finer-grained image search defined by each user. We
assume the user can access the database through a search query with tight API
limits. Therefore, a user needs to efficiently retrieve optimal images in terms

For the Crab Nebula, our results reveal that the observed multi-band photon

reformulate the online traffic shaping problem as linear programming where
these piece-wise linear functions are embedded into both the objective and

stochastic strategy to fulfill the optimized objective and the constraints in

correlation is incorporated by introducing the conditional initial condition.
In the double-scaling limit of this urn process, the self-exciting negative
binomial distribution (SE-NBD) process, which is a marked Hawkes process, is
obtained. In the standard continuous limit, this process becomes the Hawkes
process, which has no correlation in the same term. The difference is the
variance of the intensity function in that the phase transition from the steady

law distribution is obtained, is the same for the Hawkes and the urn processes.
These two processes are used to analyze empirical data of financial default to
estimate the parameters of the model. For the default portfolio, the results
produced by the urn process are superior to those obtained with the Hawkes
process and confirm self-excitation.

optimizing visual aesthetics. However, existing node distance measures yield
sub-par visualization quality as they fall short of these requirements.
Moreover, most existing measures are computationally inefficient, incurring a

flexible models are used to regress both the exposure and outcome variables on
confounders to arrive at a causal estimator with favorable robustness

and asymptotically normal under spatial dependence. As far as we are aware,
this is the first approach to spatial confounding that does not rely on
restrictive parametric assumptions (such as linearity, effect homogeneity, or
Gaussianity) for both identification and estimation. We demonstrate the
advantages of the DML approach analytically and in simulations. We apply our
methods and reasoning to a study of the effect of fine particulate matter

Stiefel manifold, which is defined on a connected network of $d$ agents. The
objective is an average of $d$ local functions, and each function is privately
held by an agent and encodes its data. The agents can only communicate with
their neighbors in a collaborative effort to solve this problem. In existing
methods, multiple rounds of communications are required to guarantee the
convergence, giving rise to high communication costs. In contrast, this paper
proposes a decentralized algorithm, called DESTINY, which only invokes a single
round of communications per iteration. DESTINY combines gradient tracking
techniques with a novel approximate augmented Lagrangian function. The global
convergence to stationary points is rigorously established. Comprehensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that DESTINY has a strong potential to
deliver a cutting-edge performance in solving a variety of testing problems.

Kink waves are routinely observed in coronal loops. Resonant
absorption is a well-accepted mechanism that extracts energy from kink waves.
Nonlinear kink waves are know to be affected by the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. However, all previous numerical studies consider linearly
polarized kink waves. Aims. We study the properties of circularly polarized
kink waves on straight plasma cylinders, for both standing and propagating
waves, and compare them to the properties of linearly polarized kink waves.
Methods. We use the code MPI-AMRVAC to solve the full 3D Magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) equations for a straight magnetic cylinder, excited by both standing and
propagating circularly polarized kink (m = 1) modes. Results. The damping due
to resonant absorption is independent of the polarization state. The morphology
or appearance of the induced resonant flow is different for the two
polarizations, however, there are essentially no differences in the
forward-modeled Doppler signals. For nonlinear oscillations, the growth rate of
small scales is determined by the total energy of the oscillation rather than
the perturbation amplitude. We discuss possible implications and seismological
relevance.

However, it still cannot infer a global optimum of the nonconvex problem,

then integrates the adaptive stochastic trajectory optimization (ASTO) in the
L-reestimation process to learn the GP-prior rewarded by the important samples

optimal motion planning (iOMP) to upgrade AGP-STO to iAGP-STO. It interpolates
the trajectory incrementally among the previously optimized waypoints to ensure
time-continuous safety. Finally, we benchmark iAGP-STO against the numerical

the tuning experiment of key parameters to show how the integration of L-reAGD,

decade, thanks to the full-disk, high spatiotemporal resolution, and
wide-temperature coverage observations taken by the SDO/AIA. In AIA
observations, QFP wave trains are seen to consist of multiple coherent and
concentric wavefronts emanating successively near the epicenter of the
accompanying flares; they propagate outwardly either along or across coronal
loops at fast-mode magnetosonic speeds from several hundred to more than 2000
km/s, and their periods are in the range of tens of seconds to several minutes.
Based on the distinct different properties of QFP wave trains, they might be
divided into two distinct categories including narrow and broad ones. For most
QFP wave trains, some of their periods are similar to those of quasi-periodic
pulsations (QPPs) in the accompanying flares, indicating that they are probably
different manifestations of the same physical process. Currently, candidate
generation mechanisms for QFP wave trains include two main categories: pulsed
energy excitation mechanism in association with magnetic reconnection and
dispersion evolution mechanism related to the dispersive evolution of
impulsively generated broadband perturbations. In addition, the generation of
some QFP wave trains might be driven by the leakage of three and five minute
oscillations from the lower atmosphere. As one of the new discoveries of SDO,
QFP wave trains provide a new tool for coronal seismology to probe the corona
parameters, and they are also useful for diagnosing the generation of QPPs,
flare processes including energy release and particle accelerations. This
review aims to summarize the main observational and theoretical results of the
spatially-resolved QFP wave trains in extreme ultraviolet observations, and
states briefly a number of questions that deserve further investigations.

generation in a coarse-to-fine manner in which earlier layers learn an overall

stacking up multiple residual blocks. Although the residual block can produce
the high-quality image as well as be trained stably, it often impedes the

introduces a novel generator architecture that produces the image by combining
features obtained through two different branches: the main and auxiliary

through the multiple residual blocks, whereas the auxiliary branch is to convey
the coarse information in the earlier layer to the later one. To combine the

extensive experiments using various standard datasets including CIFAR-10,

of the cohomology ring of toric variety as a quotient of the ring of
differential operators with constant coefficients by the annihilator of an
explicit polynomial.
  In this paper we generalize this construction to the case of quasitoric
bundles. These are fiber bundles with generalized quasitoric manifolds as
fibers. First we obtain a generalization of the BKK theorem to this case. Then
we use recently obtained descriptions of the graded-commutative algebras which
satisfy Poincar\'e duality to give a description of cohomology rings of
quasitoric bundles.

power of InfoGAN with contrastive learning. We aim to learn feature
representations that encourage a dataset to form distinct cluster boundaries in
the embedding space, while also maximizing the mutual information between the
latent code and its image observation. Our approach is to train a
discriminator, which is also used for inferring clusters, to optimize the
contrastive loss, where image-latent pairs that maximize the mutual information
are considered as positive pairs and the rest as negative pairs. Specifically,
we map the input of a generator, which was sampled from the categorical
distribution, to the embedding space of the discriminator and let them act as a
cluster centroid. In this way, C3-GAN succeeded in learning a
clustering-friendly embedding space where each cluster is distinctively
separable. Experimental results show that C3-GAN achieved the state-of-the-art

alleviating the mode collapse phenomenon. Code is available at

can strongly impact isotope signals imprinted into the calcite of these
speleothems. Here, we show that in all the variety of conditions occurring in
nature only two distinct types of degassing exist. First, when a thin film of
calcareous solution comes in contact to cave air lower pCO2 value than that of
the aqueous CO2 in the water, molecular CO2 escapes by physical diffusion in
several seconds. In a next step lasting several ten seconds, pH and DIC in the
solution achieve chemical equilibrium with respect to the CO2 in the cave
atmosphere. This solution becomes supersaturated with respect to calcite.
During precipitation for each unit CaCO3 deposited one molecule of CO2 is
generated and escapes from the solution. This precipitation driven degassing is
active during precipitation only. We show that all variations of out gassing
proposed in the literature are either diffusive outgassing or precipitation
driven degassing and that diffusive outgassing has no influence on the isotope
composition of the HCO3 - pool and consequently on that of calcite. Its isotope
imprint is determined solely by precipitation driven degassing in contrast to
most explanations in the literature. We present a theoretical model of d13C and
d18O that explains the contributions of various parameters such as changes in
temperature, changes of pCO2 in the cave atmosphere, and changes in the drip
intervals to the isotope composition of calcite precipitated to the apex of the
stalagmite. We use this model to calculate quantitatively changes of d13C and
d18O observed in field experiments (Carlson et al., 2020) in agreement to their
experimental data. We also apply our model to prior calcite precipitation (PCP)
in the field as reported by Mickler et al. (2019). We discuss how PCP
influences isotope composition signals. ...

the lattice parameters and cell volume. However, both ceramics processes a
similar monoclinic structure with the C2/c space group. Detailed
characterization using XPS, Raman, and FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the

microstructure and strain/distortion in CuO lattice after La doping.
Additionally, the band-gap of Cu0.995La0.005 ceramics decreases which is

strongly indicate that both Antarctic and tropical O3 holes must arise from an

the presence of the tropical and polar O3 holes is equivalent to the formation

  The basic tool that we use to derive the lower bounds is a good partition of

bounded from above and have volumes that are uniformly bounded from below. We
show that if $E^c$, the complement of $E$, has positive reach then we can
construct a good partition of $E$. This partition is motivated by the Whitney

do have good partitions.
  In 2D when $E^c\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ does not have positive reach, we show
that the mutliscale flat norm can be used to approximate $E$ with a set that
has a good partition under certain conditions. In this case, we provide a lower
bound on the probability that the union of the balls \emph{almost} covers $E$.

up to 90% in ensembles of particles in a broad MIR range. Finally, we show that
ultra-high-Q resonances arise in the case where Se Mie-resonators are coupled

largely employed. A quadrilateral mesh is assumed for their classical
definition, and different types of grids are identified depending on the
location of the discretized quantities. The B-grid has both velocity components
at the center of a cell, the C-grid places the velocity components on the edges
in a staggered fashion, and the D-grid is a ninety-degree rotation of a C-grid.
Historically, B-grid formulations of sea ice dynamics have been dominant
because they have matched the grid type used by ocean models. In recent years,
as ocean models have increasingly progressed to C-grids, sea ice models have
followed suit on quadrilateral meshes, but few if any implementations of
unstructured C-grid sea ice models have been developed. In this work, we
present an unstructured CD-grid type formulation of the elastic-viscous-plastic
rheology, where the velocity unknowns are located at the edges, rather than at
the vertices, as in the B-grid. The notion of a CD-grid has been recently
introduced and assumes that the velocity components are co-located at the
edges. The mesh cells in our analysis have $n$ sides, with $n$ greater than or
equal to four. Numerical results are included to investigate the features of
the proposed method. Our framework of choice is the Model for Prediction Across
Scales (MPAS) within E3SM, the climate model of the U.S. Department of Energy,
although our approach is general and could be applied to other models as well.
While MPAS-Seaice is currently defined on a B-grid, MPAS-Ocean runs on a
C-grid, hence interpolation operators are heavily used when coupled simulations
are performed. The discretization introduced here aims at transitioning the
dynamics of MPAS-Seaice to a CD-grid, to ultimately facilitate improved
coupling with MPAS-Ocean and reduce numerical errors associated with this

The characteristics of this planet will be added into a future extended
statistical analysis of the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA)
collaboration. The planetary anomaly of the light curve is characterized by MOA
and OGLE survey observations and results in three degenerate models with
different planetary mass-ratios of $q=(10.3,6.6,4.5)\times10^{-4}$,
respectively. We find that the last two models require unreasonably small
lens-source relative proper motions of $\mu_{\rm rel}\sim1\;{\rm mas/yr}$.
Considering Galactic prior probabilities, we rule out these two models from the
final result. We conduct a Bayesian analysis to estimate physical properties of
the lens system using a Galactic model and find that the lens system is
composed of a $0.49^{+0.35}_{-0.27}\;M_{\rm Jup}$ sub-Jovian planet orbiting a
$0.47^{+0.33}_{-0.25}\; M_{\odot}$ M-dwarf near the Galactic bulge. This
analysis demonstrates that Galactic priors are useful to resolve this type of
model degeneracy. This is important for estimating the mass ratio function
statistically. However, this method would be unlikely successful in shorter
timescale events, which are mostly due to low-mass objects, like brown dwarfs
or free-floating planets. Therefore, careful treatment is needed for estimating
the mass ratio function of the companions around such low-mass hosts which only
the microlensing can probe.

MPC on arbitrary functions. Yet, using today's MPC compilers requires
substantial programming effort and skill on the user's side, among other things
because nearly all compilers translate the code of the computation into a

Small-amplitude vibration is often assumed, leading to simplified physical
models that can be simulated efficiently. However, the inclusion of nonlinear
phenomena due to larger string stretchings is necessary to capture important
features, and efficient numerical algorithms are currently lacking in this
context. Of the available techniques, many lead to schemes which may only be
solved iteratively, resulting in high computational cost, and the additional
concerns of existence and uniqueness of solutions. Slow and fast waves are
present concurrently in the transverse and longitudinal directions of motion,
adding further complications concerning numerical dispersion. This work
presents a linearly-implicit scheme for the simulation of the geometrically
exact nonlinear string model. The scheme conserves a numerical energy,
expressed as the sum of quadratic terms only, and including an auxiliary state
variable yielding the nonlinear effects. This scheme allows to treat the
transverse and longitudinal waves separately, using a mixed finite
difference/modal scheme for the two directions of motion, thus allowing to

relieve experienced radiologists from the heavy workload and remind
inexperienced radiologists of misdiagnosis or missed diagnose. Existing
approaches mainly formulate radiology report generation as an image captioning
task and adopt the encoder-decoder framework. However, in the medical domain,
such pure data-driven approaches suffer from the following problems: 1) visual
and textual bias problem; 2) lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we
propose a knowledge-enhanced radiology report generation approach introduces
two types of medical knowledge: 1) General knowledge, which is input
independent and provides the broad knowledge for report generation; 2) Specific
knowledge, which is input dependent and provides the fine-grained knowledge for
report generation. To fully utilize both the general and specific knowledge, we
also propose a knowledge-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism. By merging
the visual features of the radiology image with general knowledge and specific
knowledge, the proposed model can improve the quality of generated reports.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR
show that the proposed knowledge enhanced approach outperforms state-of-the-art
image captioning based methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate that both
general and specific knowledge can help to improve the performance of radiology
report generation.

absorb the knowledge embedded in the radiology reports, we build a knowledge
base that can automatically distil and restore medical knowledge from textual

semantic alignment among reports, disease labels, and images, we explicitly
utilize textual embedding to guide the learning of the visual feature space. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed model using metrics from both natural
language generation and clinic efficacy on the public IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR

high temperature region of study, the conduction mechanism is governed by the
Arrhenius model. In the intermediate temperature range, variable range
hopping(VRH) and Arrhenius models govern the transport in the as-prepared and

occurs through Efros-Shklovskii-VRH and VRH mechanisms for the as-prepared and

indicate higher negative magneto resistance in the annealed sample at all

co-existing glassy magnetic phase along with the canted antiferromagnetic

to various factors, including skin thickness, body fat percentage, and
electrode placement. Therefore, obtaining high generalization quality of a

decoders are either trained on subject-specific data, or at least recalibrated
for each user, individually. Even though, deep learning algorithms produced
several state of the art results for sEMG decoding,however, due to the limited
amount of availability of sEMG data, the deep learning models are prone to
overfitting. Recently, transfer learning for domain adaptation improved
generalization quality with reduced training time on various machine learning
tasks. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning
using weight initialization for recalibration of two different pretrained deep
learning models on a new subjects data, and compare their performance to
subject-specific models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that thoroughly investigated weight-initialization based transfer learning for

leading to topological Hall effect (THE). However, several recent reports have
emphasized in context of ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ based heterostructures that
the sample inhomogeneity can also result in THE-like features. In order to
investigate this issue in general for any ferromagnetic heterostructure, we
have considered a phenomenological model to calculate the changes in the shape
of hysteresis loop due to various interfacial effects. These changes in the
magnetization have been accounted for by considering that the interdomain
magnetic coupling parameter ($\alpha$) varies exponentially with the distance
from the interface along the growth direction of the heterostructure. In case
of symmetric interfaces on both sides of a ferromagnet, we have considered the
variation of $\alpha$ as a Gaussian function. We have found that the additional
AHE contribution due to the net change in magnetization in such cases are akin
to experimentally observed THE, even though we have not considered any
topological quantity explicitly in our model. Thus, we propose another
situation with nonuniform magnetization profile that may be used to explain
additional features in AHE, which might not necessarily be intrinsic THE.

rewards for all tasks of interest are assumed to be expressible as a linear
combination of a fixed set of features. We show theoretically that, under
certain assumptions, having access to a specific set of diverse policies, which
we call a set of independent policies, can allow for instantaneously achieving
high-level performance on all possible downstream tasks which are typically
more complex than the ones on which the agent was trained. Based on this
theoretical analysis, we propose a simple algorithm that iteratively constructs
this set of policies. In addition to empirically validating our theoretical
results, we compare our approach with recently proposed diverse policy set
construction methods and show that, while others fail, our approach is able to
build a behavior basis that enables instantaneous transfer to all possible
downstream tasks. We also show empirically that having access to a set of
independent policies can better bootstrap the learning process on downstream
tasks where the new reward function cannot be described as a linear combination

technologies for detecting face masks have not been deployed at a large scale

present a two-step face mask detection approach consisting of two separate
modules: 1) face detection and alignment and 2) face mask classification. This
approach allowed us to experiment with different combinations of face detection
and face mask classification modules. More specifically, we experimented with
PyramidKey and RetinaFace as face detectors while maintaining a lightweight
backbone for the face mask classification module. Moreover, we also provide a
relabeled annotation of the test set of the AIZOO dataset, where we rectified
the incorrect labels for some face images. The evaluation results on the AIZOO
and Moxa 3K datasets showed that the proposed face mask detection pipeline
surpassed the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed pipeline also yielded a
higher mAP on the relabeled test set of the AIZOO dataset than the original
test set. Since we trained the proposed model using in-the-wild face images, we
can successfully deploy our model to monitor the mask-wearing rate using public
CCTV images.

exchange interactions by studying its dynamics. Specifically, we consider
two-time correlations for the Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) Hamiltonian close to the
so-called Kitaev critical point. Here, the model coincides with a phase
boundary of two uncoupled instances of Kitaev's model for p-wave
superconductors, together supporting a degenerate ground state characterized by
multiple Majorana modes. In this regime, the real-time dynamics of local spins
reveal a set of strong zero modes, corresponding to a set of protruding
frequencies in the two-time correlation function. We derive perturbative
interactions that map the KH spin chain onto the topological regime of Kitaev's
fermionic model, thus opening up a bulk gap whilst retaining almost degenerate
modes in the mesoscopic regime, i.e., for finite system sizes. This showcases
the emergence of Majorana modes in a chain of effective dimers. Here, the
binding energy within each unit cell competes with the inter-dimer coupling to
generate a finite size energy gap, in analogy with local energy terms in the
transverse-field Ising model. These modes give rise to long coherence times of
local spins located at the system edges. By breaking the local symmetry in each
dimer, one can also observe a second class of Majorana modes in terms of a
beating frequency in the two-time correlations function of the edge spin.
Furthermore, we develop a scenario for realizing these model predictions in
ion-trap quantum simulators with collective addressing of the ions.

investigate asymptotically de Sitter rotating black holes wherein interpreting
the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as the vacuum energy leads to a deformation

then visualize the shadow of black holes for various parameters for an observer

estimate the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ from its shadow observables. The
shadow observables of the new Kerr--de Sitter black holes significantly deviate

with optimal order on polygonal/polyhedral domains. On smooth two/three

to the one of [31]. We prove that, given a polygonal/polyhedral approximation
$\Omega_h$ of the domain $\Omega$, an optimal convergence rate can be achieved
by using a suitable correction depending on high order derivatives of the
discrete solution along outward directions (not necessarily orthogonal) at the
boundary facets of $\Omega_h$. Numerical experiments validate the theory.

in cavitation or the formation of small bubbles. Cavitation bubbles are
generated in real solutions without the use of optical traps making our system
as close to real conditions as possible. Under the action of the ultrasound,
bubbles can grow, oscillate, and eventually, they collapse or decompose. We
apply the mathematical method of separation of motions to interpret the
acoustic effect on the bubbles. While in most situations, the spherical shape
of a bubble is the most energetically profitable as it minimizes the surface
energy, when the acoustic frequency is in resonance with the natural frequency
of the bubble, shapes with the dihedral symmetry emerge. Some of these
resonance shapes turn unstable, so the bubble decomposes. It turns out that
bubbles in the solutions of different concentrations (with different surface
energies and densities) attain different evolution paths. While it is difficult
to obtain a deterministic description of how the solution concentration affects
bubble dynamics, it is possible to separate images with different
concentrations by applying the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm. An
ANN was trained to detect the concentration of alcohol in a water solution
based on the bubble images. This indicates that Artificial Intelligence (AI)
methods can complement deterministic analysis in non-equilibrium, near-unstable

be abundantly generated in a cosmic era dominated by ultralight primordial
black holes, with masses $m_\mathrm{PBH}<10^{9}\mathrm{g}$. In this work, we
consider $f(R)$ gravity as the underlying gravitational theory and we study its
effect at the level of the gravitational potential of Poisson distributed

model. In particular, by requiring that the scalar induced GWs (SIGWs) are not
overproduced, we find an upper bound on the abundance of PBHs at formation time
$\Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}$ as a function of their mass, namely that
$\Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}<5.5\times
10^{-5}\left(\frac{10^9\mathrm{g}}{m_\mathrm{PBH}}\right)^{1/4}$, which is
$45\%$ tighter than the respective upper bound in general relativity.
Afterwards, by considering $R^2$ gravity as an illustrative case study of an
$f(R)$ gravity model, we also set upper bound constraints on its mass parameter
$M$. These mass parameter constraints, however, should not be regarded as
physical given the fact that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints
on $R^2$ gravity are quite tight. Finally, we conclude that the portal of SIGWs

communications, studies have shown that it is too congested to provide reliable
transmission for the platoons. Additional spectrum resources, i.e., secondary
spectrum channels, can be utilized when these are not occupied by other users.
Characteristics of interference in these channels are usually
location-dependent and can be stored in the so-called Radio Environment Maps

secondary spectrum channel for intra-platoon communications. We propose to
assess the channel's quality in terms of outage probability computed, with the
use of estimated interference distributions stored in REM. A frequency
selection algorithm that minimizes the number of channel switches along the
planned platoon route is proposed. Additionally, the REM creation procedure is
shown that reduces the number of database entries using (Density-Based Spatial

tested using real IQ samples captured on a real road. Application of the DBSCAN
clustering to the constructed REM provided 7% reduction in its size.
Utilization of the proposed channel selection algorithm resulted in a 35 times

a protein sensor. We investigate the distribution of the reaction time, i.e.,
the first instance when all independently diffusing particles are bound to the
target. When each particle binds irreversibly, this is equivalent to the
first-passage time of the slowest (last) particle. In turn, reversible binding
to the target renders the problem much more challenging and drastically changes
the distribution of the reaction time. We derive the exact solution of this
problem and investigate the short-time and long-time asymptotic behaviors of
the reaction time probability density. We also analyze how the mean reaction
time depends on the unbinding rate and the number of particles. Our exact and
asymptotic solutions are compared to Monte Carlo simulations.

  Pb$_2$Ir$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$",,,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-Fermi liquid behavior in some fermionic systems have attracted
significant interest in last few decades. Certain pyrochlore iridates with
stronger spin-orbit coupling strength have recently been added to the list.
Here, we provide evidence of such a non-Fermi liquid ground state in another
mixed valent metallic pyrochlore iridate Pb$_2$Ir$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, through
the combined investigation of electronic, magnetic and thermodynamic properties
as a function of temperature ($T$) and applied magnetic field ($H$).
Resistivity measurement showed a linear temperature dependence down to 15~K
below which it shows $\rho \sim T^{3/2}$ dependence while magnetic
susceptibility diverges as $\chi$(T) $\sim$ $T^{-\alpha}$ ($\alpha < 1$) below
10~K. While a strong negative $\Theta_{CW}$ has been observed from Curie-Weiss
fitting, absence of any long range order down to 80~mK only indicates presence
of strong inherent geometric frustration in the system. Heat capacity data
showed $C_p$ $\sim$ $T\ln(T_0/T)$ + ${\beta}T^3$ dependence below 15~K down to
1.8~K. More importantly spin-orbit coupling strength by x-ray absorption
spectroscopy was found to be weaker in Pb$_2$Ir$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ compared to
other pyrochlore iridates. In absence of any large moment rare earth magnetic
ion, Pb$_2$Ir$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ presents a rare example of an irirdate system
showing non-Fermi liquid behaviour due to disordered distribution of Ir$^{4+}$
and Ir$^{5+}$ having markedly different strengths of spin-orbit coupling which
might offer a prescription for achieving new non-Fermi liquid systems.

show that our GLSL implementation easily outperforms a multicore CPU

models with openly available and widely-used data sets, and with a novel data
set of students learning to program. The evaluated knowledge tracing models
include Vanilla-DKT, two Long Short-Term Memory Deep Knowledge Tracing
(LSTM-DKT) variants, two Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) variants, and
Self-Attentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT). As baselines, we evaluate simple
non-learning models, logistic regression and Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT).
To evaluate how different aspects of DLKT models influence model performance,
we test input and output layer variations found in the compared models that are
independent of the main architectures. We study maximum attempt count options,
including filtering out long attempt sequences, that have been implicitly and
explicitly used in prior studies. We contrast the observed performance
variations against variations from non-model properties such as randomness and
hardware. Performance of models is assessed using multiple metrics, whereby we
also contrast the impact of the choice of metric on model performance. The key
contributions of this work are: Evidence that DLKT models generally outperform
more traditional models, but not necessarily by much and not always; Evidence
that even simple baselines with little to no predictive value may outperform
DLKT models, especially in terms of accuracy -- highlighting importance of
selecting proper baselines for comparison; Disambiguation of properties that
affect performance in DLKT models including metric choice, input and output
layer variations, common hyperparameters, random seeding and hardware;
Discussion of issues in replicability when evaluating DLKT models, including
discrepancies in prior reported results and methodology. Model implementations,

objects from a single RGB or RGB-D input image, assuming that 3D models of the
objects are available. This problem is of great importance to many application
fields such as robotic manipulation, augmented reality, and autonomous driving.
First, we propose EPOS, a method for 6D object pose estimation from an RGB
image. The key idea is to represent an object by compact surface fragments and
predict the probability distribution of corresponding fragments at each pixel
of the input image by a neural network. Each pixel is linked with a
data-dependent number of fragments, which allows systematic handling of
symmetries, and the 6D poses are estimated from the links by a RANSAC-based
fitting method. EPOS outperformed all RGB and most RGB-D and D methods on
several standard datasets. Second, we present HashMatch, an RGB-D method that
slides a window over the input image and searches for a match against
templates, which are pre-generated by rendering 3D object models in different
orientations. The method applies a cascade of evaluation stages to each window
location, which avoids exhaustive matching against all templates. Third, we
propose ObjectSynth, an approach to synthesize photorealistic images of 3D
object models for training methods based on neural networks. The images yield
substantial improvements compared to commonly used images of objects rendered
on top of random photographs. Fourth, we introduce T-LESS, the first dataset
for 6D object pose estimation that includes 3D models and RGB-D images of
industry-relevant objects. Fifth, we define BOP, a benchmark that captures the
status quo in the field. BOP comprises eleven datasets in a unified format, an
evaluation methodology, an online evaluation system, and public challenges held
at international workshops organized at the ICCV and ECCV conferences.

considering non-extensive statistical mechanics. The heat capacity, free energy
and pressure of the universe are obtained. For the Tsallis entropy model, we
obtained the constraint for $\beta$, namely, $1/2 < \beta < 2$. The free energy
of a thermal equilibrium universe must be less than zero. We suggest that the
reason for the accelerated expansion of the universe is not due to Tsallis
entropy. Similar results are obtained for loop quantum gravity. However, since
the values of $\Lambda(\gamma)$ and $q$ cannot be determined in this model, the
results become more subtle than that in the Tsallis entropy model. In addition,
we compare the results for the universe with those for a Schwarzschild black

derivative) on a closed surface $M\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ and includes extrinsic
effects via the shape operator $\mathscr{S}$ induced by the Euclidean embedding
of~$M$. The functional depends on the small parameter $\varepsilon>0$. When
$\varepsilon$ is small it is clear from the structure of the Ginzburg-Landau
functional that $\left|u\right|_g$ ''prefers'' to be close to $1$. However, due
to the incompatibility for vector fields on $M$ between the Sobolev regularity
and the unit norm constraint, when $\varepsilon$ is close to $0$, it is
expected that a finite number of singular points (called vortices) having
non-zero index emerges (when the Euler characteristic is non-zero). This
intuitive picture has been made precise in the recent work by R. Ignat \& R.
Jerrard [7]. In this paper we are interested the dynamics of vortices generated
by $F_\varepsilon^{\mathrm{extr}}$. To this end we study the behavior when

superiority of quantum computers over classical supercomputers. While quantum

Specifically, our algorithm performs rejection sampling after the introduced
very recently multi-tensor contraction algorithm. We show that the fidelity can
be controlled by partially contracting the dominant paths in the tensor network

demonstration, we classically produced 1 million samples with the fidelity

optically levitated nano-particle in a bichromatic cavity, in which two cavity
modes could be excited by the scattering photons of the dual-tweezers

coupling between the cavity field and torsional motion of nano-particle could
be achieved for the current experimental conditions. With the back-action of
the optically levtiated nano-particle, the broad single-mode squeezing light
can be realized in the bad cavity regime. Even at room temperature, the
single-mode light can be squeezed for more than 17 dB, which is far beyond the
3 dB limit. The two-mode squeezing lights can also be generated, if the optical
tweezers contain two frequencies, one is on the red sideband of the cavity

Long sequential data traps local information such as seasonality and
fluctuations in short data sequences. In addition, the original Transformer
consumes more resources by carrying the entire attention matrix during the
training course. To overcome these challenges, ChunkFormer splits the long
sequences into smaller sequence chunks for the attention calculation,
progressively applying different chunk sizes in each stage. In this way, the
proposed model gradually learns both local and global information without
changing the total length of the input sequences. We have extensively tested
the effectiveness of this new architecture on different business domains and
have proved the advantage of such a model over the existing Transformer-based

ATP by cycling through a sequence of chemical states. These cytoplasmic motors
are dimers made up of two linked identical monomeric globular proteins. Fueled
by the free energy generated by ATP hydrolysis, the motors walk on polar tracks
(microtubule or filamentous actin) processively, which means that only one head
detaches and executes a mechanical step while the other stays bound to the
track. Thus, the one motor head must regulate chemical state of the other,
referred to as ""gating"", a concept that is not fully understood. Inspired by
experiments, showing that only a fraction of the energy from ATP hydrolysis is
used to advance the kinesin motors against load, we demonstrate that additional
energy is used for coordinating the chemical cycles of the two heads in the
dimer - a feature that characterizes gating. To this end, we develop a general
framework based on information theory and stochastic thermodynamics, and
establish that gating could be quantified in terms of information flow between
the motor heads. Applications of the theory to kinesin-1 and Myosin V show that
information flow occurs, with positive cooperativity, at external resistive
loads that are less than a critical value, $F_c$. When force exceeds $F_c$,
effective information flow ceases. Interestingly, $F_c$, which is independent
of the input energy generated through ATP hydrolysis, coincides with force at
which the probability of backward steps starts to increase. Our findings
suggest that transport efficiency is optimal only at forces less than $F_c$,
which implies that these motors must operate at low loads under $\textit{in

(GNNs) prevail to extract the critical features from the input graph and
support the prediction. They mostly follow the paradigm of learning to attend,
which maximizes the mutual information between the attended graph and the
ground-truth label. However, this paradigm makes GNN classifiers recklessly
absorb all the statistical correlations between input features and labels in
the training data, without distinguishing the causal and noncausal effects of
features. Instead of underscoring the causal features, the attended graphs are
prone to visit the noncausal features as the shortcut to predictions. Such
shortcut features might easily change outside the training distribution,
thereby making the GNN classifiers suffer from poor generalization. In this
work, we take a causal look at the GNN modeling for graph classification. With
our causal assumption, the shortcut feature serves as a confounder between the
causal feature and prediction. It tricks the classifier to learn spurious
correlations that facilitate the prediction in in-distribution (ID) test
evaluation, while causing the performance drop in out-of-distribution (OOD)
test data. To endow the classifier with better interpretation and
generalization, we propose the Causal Attention Learning (CAL) strategy, which
discovers the causal patterns and mitigates the confounding effect of
shortcuts. Specifically, we employ attention modules to estimate the causal and
shortcut features of the input graph. We then parameterize the backdoor
adjustment of causal theory -- combine each causal feature with various
shortcut features. It encourages the stable relationships between the causal
estimation and prediction, regardless of the changes in shortcut parts and
distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of CAL.

familiar than the other, and offers in-domain prior knowledge, such as semantic
segmentation. We argue that for complex scenes, figuring out the semantic
structure of the domain is hard, especially with no supervision, but is an
important part of a successful I2I operation. We hence introduce two techniques
to incorporate this invaluable in-domain prior knowledge for the benefit of
translation quality: through a novel Multi-Stream generator architecture, and
through a semantic segmentation-based regularization loss term. In essence, we
propose splitting the input data according to semantic masks, explicitly
guiding the network to different behavior for the different regions of the
image. In addition, we propose training a semantic segmentation network along
with the translation task, and to leverage this output as a loss term that
improves robustness. We validate our approach on urban data, demonstrating
superior quality in the challenging UI2I tasks of converting day images to
night ones. In addition, we also demonstrate how reinforcing the target dataset

waves has not been reported in the literature. Here, we present the first
unambiguous observational evidence of the total reflection of a quasi-periodic
EUV wave train during its interaction with a polar CH. The event occurred in
NOAA AR 12473, located close to the southeast limb of the solar disk, and was
characterized by a jet-like CME. In this study, we focus in particular on the
driving mechanism s of the quasi-periodic wave train and the total reflection
effect at the CH boundary. We find that the periods of the incident and the
reflected wave trains are both about 100 seconds. The excitation of the
quasi-periodic wave train was possibly due to the intermittent energy release
in the associated flare since its period is similar to that of the
quasi-periodic pulsations in the associated flare. Our observational results
showed that the reflection of the wave train at the boundary of the CH was a
total reflection because the measured incidence and critical angles satisfy the

double twisted trilayer graphene (TLG), where three monolayer graphene (MLG)
are stacked on top of each other with two twist angles [J. M. Park, et al.,
Nature 590, 249 (2021); Z. Hao, et al., Science 371, 1133 (2021); X. Zhang, et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett.127, 166802 (2021)]. When some of MLGs in the double
twisted TLG are replaced by bilayer graphene (BLG), we get a new family of
double twisted moire heterostructure, namely double twisted few layer graphene
(DTFLG). In this work, we theoretically investigate the moire band structures
of the DTFLGs with diverse arrangements of MLG and BLG. We find that, depending
on the relative rotation direction of the two twist angles (alternate or chiral
twist) and the middle van der Waals (vdW) layer (MLG or BLG), a general
(X+Y+Z)-DTFLG can be classified into four categories, i.e. (X+1+Z)-ATFLG,
(X+2+Z)-ATFLG, (X+1+Z)-CTFLG and (X+2+Z)-CTFLG, each of which has its own
unique band structure. Here, X, Y, Z denote the three vdW layers, i.e. MLG or
BLG. Interestingly, the (X+1+Z)-ATFLGs have a pair of perfect flat bands at the
magic angle about $1.54^\circ$ coexisting with a pair of linear or parabolic
bands, which is quite like the double twisted TLG. Meanwhile, when the twist
angle is smaller than a ""magic angle"" $1.70^\circ$, the (X+2+Z)-CTFLGs can have
two isolated narrow bands at $E_f$ with band width less than 5 meV. The
influence of electric field and the topological features of the moire bands
have been studied as well. Our work indicates that the DTFLGs, especially the
(X+1+Z)-ATFLG and (X+2+Z)-CTFLG, are promising platforms to study the moire
flat band induced novel correlation and topological effects.

formulates colour alignment as a three-step process: camera response
calibration, response linearisation, and colour matching. The proposed model
works with non-standard colour references, i.e., colour patches without knowing
the true colour values, by utilising a novel balance-of-linear-distances
feature. It is equivalent to determining the camera parameters through an
unsupervised process. It also works with a minimum number of corresponding
colour patches across the images to be colour aligned to deliver the applicable

various illumination and exposure conditions were used to evaluate the model.
Performance benchmarks demonstrated that our model achieved superior
performance compared to other popular and state-of-the-art methods.

of mean and standard deviation of a quantity of interest, while reliability is
employed through a probabilistic constraint. The Smolyak-type sparse grid and
the stochastic response surface method are applied to reduce computational
cost. Furthermore, an efficient inverse-reliability algorithm is utilized to
decouple the double-loop structure of reliability analysis. The proposed

propose a novel RL-based model AttentionLight base on QL-XLight that uses a

particularly focus on the neutron star models, in which the direct Urca (rapid

superconductivity. For such models, the cooling curve hardly depends on the
equation of state (EOS) as well as the mass of neutron star, while we show that
the gravitational wave frequencies strongly depend on the both properties.
Then, we find that the frequencies of the fundamental and the 1st pressure mode
multiplied with the stellar mass are well expressed as a function of the
stellar compactness almost independently of the EOS. We also find that the
frequency of the 1st gravity mode in later phase of the thermal evolution is
strongly correlated with the stellar compactness. In addition, we derive the
empirical formula estimating the threshold mass for the onset of the direct
Urca inside the neutron star as a function of the nuclear saturation parameter.
This formula will give us a constraint on the neutron star properties, if it

  multivariate statistical power trade-offs","Submitted to AI4Science (ICML workshop). Not published yet",,,,"stat.ME cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Statistical power estimation for studies with multiple model parameters is
inherently a multivariate problem. Power for individual parameters of interest
cannot be reliably estimated univariately since correlation and variance
explained relative to one parameter will impact the power for another
parameter, all usual univariate considerations being equal. Explicit solutions
in such cases, especially for models with many parameters, are either
impractical or impossible to solve, leaving researchers to the prevailing
method of simulating power. However, the point estimates for a vector of model
parameters are uncertain, and the impact of inaccuracy is unknown. In such
cases, sensitivity analysis is recommended such that multiple combinations of
possible observable parameter vectors are simulated to understand power
trade-offs. A limitation to this approach is that it is computationally
expensive to generate sufficient sensitivity combinations to accurately map the
power trade-off function in increasingly high-dimensional spaces for the models
that social scientists estimate. This paper explores the efficient estimation
and graphing of statistical power for a study over varying model parameter
combinations. We propose a simple and generalizable machine learning inspired
solution to cut the computational cost to less than 10% of the brute force
method while providing F1 scores above 90%. We further motivate the impact of
transfer learning in learning power manifolds across varying distributions.

collected training data, which easily leads to over-fitting of deep neural
networks (DNNs). Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a
sample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing
weighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing
only either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with
corrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How
to handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this
paper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar
transient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves,
which could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by
this, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate
training strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole
biased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each
sample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the
resulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named
CurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper
weights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning
also blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer
meta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom
layers. Extensive synthetic and real experiments well validate the proposed
method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging

compare it with results from the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Both
these methods lead to a rich phase diagram, where both power-law BKT scaling
and spontaneous symmetry breaking appear for the same (intermediate) decay
rates of long-range interactions. The method is also applied to the long-range
quantum $XXZ$ spin chain at zero temperature. We discuss the relation between
the phase diagrams of the two models and we give predictions about the scaling
of the order parameter of the quantum chain close to the transition. Finally,

of nodes that share (or differ in) certain attributes to be linked; we consider
dynamic networks in which nodes can be added over time but not removed. Our
application is to HIV genetic linkage analysis that has been used to
investigate HIV transmission dynamics. In this setting, two HIV sequences from
different persons with HIV (PWH) are said to be linked if the genetic distance
between these sequences is less than a given threshold. Such linkage suggests
that that the nodes representing the two infected PWH, are close to each other
in a transmission network; such proximity would imply that either one of the
infected people directly transmitted the virus to the other or indirectly
transmitted it through a small number of intermediaries. These viral genetic
linkage networks are dynamic in the sense that, over time, a group or cluster
of genetically linked viral sequences may increase in size as new people are
infected by those in the cluster either directly or through intermediaries. Our
approach makes use of a logistic model to describe homophily with regard to
demographic and behavioral characteristics that is we investigate whether
similarities (or differences) between PWH in these characteristics impacts the
probability that their sequences are be linked. Such analyses provide
information about HIV transmission dynamics within a population.

conducted. Soil water was represented by a point cloud through the
center-of-mass method. Water-air interface area was measured numerically by the
alpha shape method. The soil-water retention mechanism at the nanoscale was
analyzed by distinguishing adsorptive pressure and capillary pressure at
different mass water content (degree of saturation) and considering apparent
capillary interface area (water-air interface area per unit water volume).
Water number density profile that distinguishes adsorptive water and capillary
water was used to quantify adsorption effect. Machine learning based curve
fitting technique was utilized to construct function relationships among mass
water content, adsorptive pressure, capillary pressure and apparent soil-water
interface area. It has been demonstrated from the numerical results that the
adsorption effect is dominated by van der Waals force between clay and water at
the nanoscale. With the increase of degree of saturation, the impact of
adsorption decreases and capillarity becomes a dominant effect in the
soil-water retention mechanism at the nanoscale.

opens a new avenue toward modulating elastic waves in solids. However, because
of the full-vector feature, and the complicated couplings of the longitudinal
and transverse components of elastic waves, manipulating elastic waves is
generally difficult, compared with manipulating acoustic waves (scalar waves)
and electromagnetic waves (vectorial waves but transverse only). Up to date,
topological materials, including insulators and semimetals, have been realized
for acoustic and electromagnetic waves. Although topological materials of
elastic waves have also been reported, the topological edge modes observed all
lie on the domain wall. A natural question can be asked: whether there exists
an elastic metamaterial with the topological edge modes on its own boundary
only? Here, we report a 3D metal-printed bilayer metamaterial, insulating
topologically the elastic waves. By introducing the chiral interlayer
couplings, the spin-orbit couplings for elastic waves are induced, which give
rise to nontrivial topological properties. The helical edge states with the
vortex feature are demonstrated on the boundary of the single topological
phase. We further show a heterostructure of the metamaterial, which exhibits
tunable edge transport. Our work may have potential in devices based on elastic
