permeation and desorption methods. Electrochemical charging, electro-permeation
and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) experiments are conducted. Firstly,
the relation between the charging current and the hydrogen concentration is
established. Secondly, permeation experiments are conducted at 22, 40 and
67{\deg}C to quantify the diffusivity dependence on temperature. Finally, the
diffusivity is estimated by using two types of desorption experiments and
Fick's law: (i) a `rest time' method, by which we measure the hydrogen content
of samples held at room temperature for different times, and (ii) isothermal
desorption experiments at temperatures ranging from 22 to 80{\deg}C, fitting
the resulting desorption rate versus time curves. Good agreement is obtained
between the isothermal desorption and permeation approaches, with observed
differences discussed and rationalised. Moreover, measured diffusivity values
for cold-rolled pure iron are also found to be comparable to those reported in
the literature. This work demonstrates that isothermal desorption experiments
are a convenient approach to determine hydrogen diffusivity over a wide range
of temperatures, as facilitated by new TDS systems with fast heating rates.

When available, large sets of demonstrations can guide agent exploration.
Hindsight relabelling on the other hand does not require additional sources of

In this work, we extend hindsight relabelling mechanisms to guide exploration

platforms is the policy directing sequential experiments, namely, to decide
where to conduct the next experiment based on what has been done thus far. Such
policy inevitably trades off exploitation versus exploration and the current
practice is under the Bayesian optimization framework using the expected

trade off exploitation versus exploration by measuring the element and degree
of surprise associated with the immediate past observation. We devise a
surprise-reacting policy using two existing surprise metrics, known as the
Shannon surprise and Bayesian surprise. Our analysis shows that the
surprise-reacting policy appears to be better suited for quickly characterizing
the overall landscape of a response surface or a design place under resource
constraints. We argue that such capability is much needed for futuristic
autonomous experimentation platforms. We do not claim that we have a fully

simpler and more efficient than previous ones. In particular, it allows us to
tackle the $(\operatorname{deg}+1)$-list-coloring (D1LC) problem, where each
node $v$ of degree $d_v$ is assigned a palette of $d_v+1$ colors, and the
objective is to find a proper coloring using these palettes. While for
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring (where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree), there is a fast
randomized distributed $O(\log^3\log n)$-round algorithm (Chang, Li, and Pettie
[SIAM J. Comp. 2020]), no $o(\log n)$-round algorithms are known for the D1LC
problem.
  We give a randomized distributed algorithm for D1LC that is optimal under
plausible assumptions about the deterministic complexity of the problem. Using
the recent deterministic algorithm of Ghaffari and Kuhn [FOCS2021], our
algorithm runs in $O(\log^3 \log n)$ time, matching the best bound known for
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring. In addition, it colors all nodes of degree
$\Omega(\log^7 n)$ in $O(\log^* n)$ rounds.
  A key contribution is a subroutine to generate slack for D1LC. When placed
into the framework of Assadi, Chen, and Khanna [SODA2019] and Alon and Assadi
[APPROX/RANDOM2020], this almost immediately leads to a palette sparsification
theorem for D1LC, generalizing previous results. That gives fast algorithms for
D1LC in three different models: an $O(1)$-round algorithm in the MPC model with

many-body systems far from the ground state, the varied family of Loschmidt
echoes (LEs) became an invaluable tool in several experimental techniques. A LE
involves a time-reversal procedure to assess the effect of perturbations in a
quantum excitation dynamics. However, when addressing macroscopic systems one
is repeatedly confronted with limitations that seem insurmountable. This led to
formulate the \textit{central hypothesis of irreversibility} stating that the
time-scale of decoherence, $T_3$, is proportional to the time-scale of the
many-body interactions we reversed, $T_2$. We test this by implementing two
experimental schemes based on Floquet Hamiltonians where the effective strength
of the dipolar spin-spin coupling, i.e. $1/T_2$, is reduced by a variable scale
factor $k$. This extends the perturbations time scale, $T_\Sigma$, in relation
to $T_2$. Strikingly, we observe the superposition of the normalized Loschmidt
echoes for the bigger values of $k$. This manifests the dominance of the
intrinsic dynamics over the perturbation factors, even when the Loschmidt echo
is devised to reverse that intrinsic dynamics. Thus, in the limit where the
reversible interactions dominate over perturbations, the LE decays within a
time-scale, $T_3\approx T_2/R$ with $R=(0.15 \pm 0.01)$, confirming the
emergence of a perturbation independent regime. These results support the
central hypothesis of irreversibility.

thermonuclear explosions of the accreted plasma which are markedly different
from those observed in non-pulsating low mass X-ray binaries. The AMXP XTE
J1814-338 is known for having burst oscillations that are phase locked
(constant phase difference) and coincident with the accretion powered
pulsations during all its thermonuclear bursts but the last one. In this work
we use a coherent timing analysis to investigate this phenomenon in more detail
and with higher time resolution than was done in the past. We confirm that the
burst oscillation phases are, on average, phase locked to the accretion powered
pulsations. However, they also display moderate (<~ 0.1 cycles) drifts during
each individual burst, showing a repeating pattern that is consistently
observed according to the thermonuclear burst phase (rise, peak, tail). Despite
the existence of these drifting patterns, the burst oscillation phases somehow
are able to average out at almost the exact position of the accretion powered
pulsations. We provide a kinematic description of the phenomenon and review the
existing models in the literature. The phenomenon remains without a clear
explanation, but we can place important constraints on the thermonuclear burst
mechanism. In particular, the observations imply that the ignition point of the
thermonuclear burst occurs close to the foot of the accretion column. We
speculate that the burning fluid expands in a backward tilted accretion column
trapped by the magnetic field, while at the same time the burning flame covers
the surface.

be exhibited in the appropriate reduced density matrices when the relevant

sufficiently far apart from each other. This concept is usually exploited to
identify the value of the condensate density, without explicit concern,
however, on the spatial range over which this asymptotic condition can
effectively be achieved. Here, based on a diagrammatic approach that includes
beyond-mean-field pairing fluctuations in the broken-symmetry phase at the
level of the $t$-matrix also with the inclusion of the Gorkov-Melik-Barkhudarov
(GMB) correction, we present a systematic study of the two-particle reduced
density matrix for a superfluid fermionic system undergoing the BCS-BEC
crossover, when the entities to recede far apart from each other evolve with
continuity from largely overlapping Cooper pairs in the BCS limit to dilute
composite bosons in the BEC limit. By this approach, we not only provide the
coupling and temperature dependence of the condensate density at the level of
our diagrammatic approach which includes the GMB correction, but we also obtain
the evolution of the spatial dependence of the two-particle reduced density
matrix, from a power-law at low temperature to an exponential dependence at
high temperature in the superfluid phase, when the inter-particle coupling
spans the BCS-BEC crossover. Our results put limitations on the minimum spatial
extent of a finite-size system for which superfluid correlations can

as they directly contribute to the evolution of the social network structure,
affecting the information and the opinions users are exposed to.
  In this paper, we propose a framework to assess the effect of people
recommenders on the evolution of opinions. Our proposal is based on Monte Carlo
simulations combining link recommendation and opinion-dynamics models. In order
to control initial conditions, we define a random network model to generate
graphs with opinions, with tunable amounts of modularity and homophily. We join
these elements into a methodology to study the effects of the recommender
system on echo chambers and polarization. We also show how to use our framework
to measure, by means of simulations, the impact of different intervention
strategies.
  Our thorough experimentation shows that people recommenders can in fact lead
to a significant increase in echo chambers. However, this happens only if there
is considerable initial homophily in the network. Also, we find that if the
network already contains echo chambers, the effect of the recommendation
algorithm is negligible. Such findings are robust to two very different opinion
dynamics models, a bounded confidence model and an epistemological model.

Those problems are of high interest in automated sports analytics, production,

multiplication of single-task models, the use of the off-the-shelf models also
impedes the performance due to the complexity and specificity of the team

limitations, our paper proposes to train a single model that simultaneously
predicts the ball and the player mask and pose by combining the part intensity
fields and the spatial embeddings principles. Part intensity fields provide the
ball and player location, as well as player joints location. Spatial embeddings
are then exploited to associate player instance pixels to their respective

interval, chordal, and bipartite graphs, can be characterized by the existence
of an ordering of the vertices avoiding some ordered subgraphs, called
patterns. Very recently, all the classes corresponding to patterns on three
vertices (including the ones mentioned above) have been listed, and proved to
be efficiently recognizable. In contrast, very little is known about patterns
on four vertices.
  One of the few graph classes characterized by a pattern on four vertices is
the class of intersection graphs of rectangles that are said to be grounded on
a line. This class appears naturally in the study of intersection graphs, and
similar grounded classes have recently attracted a lot of attention.
  This paper contains three parts. First, we make a survey of grounded
intersection graph classes, summarizing all the known inclusions between these
various classes. Second, we show that the correspondence between a pattern on
four vertices and grounded rectangle graphs is not an isolated phenomenon. We
establish several other pattern characterizations for geometric classes, and
show that the hierarchy of grounded intersection graph classes is tightly
interleaved with the classes defined patterns on four vertices. We claim that
forbidden patterns are a useful tool to classify grounded intersection graphs.
Finally, we give an overview of the complexity of the recognition of classes
defined by forbidden patterns on four vertices and list several interesting
open problems.

bringing multimedia content closer to the users. Although massive connectivity
enabled by MEC networks will significantly increase the quality of
communications, there are several key challenges ahead. The limited storage of
edge nodes, the large size of multimedia content, and the time-variant users'
preferences make it critical to efficiently and dynamically predict the
popularity of content to store the most upcoming requested ones before being

a kinetic impactor as a means of planetary defense. In late 2022, DART will
collide with Dimorphos, the secondary in the Didymos binary asteroid system.
The impact will cause a momentum transfer from the spacecraft to the binary
asteroid, changing the orbit period of Dimorphos and forcing it to librate in
its orbit. Owing to the coupled dynamics in binary asteroid systems, the orbit
and libration state of Dimorphos are intertwined. Thus, as the secondary
librates, it also experiences fluctuations in its orbit period. These
variations in the orbit period are dependent on the magnitude of the impact
perturbation, as well as the system's state at impact and the moments of
inertia of the secondary. In general, any binary asteroid system whose
secondary is librating will have a non-constant orbit period on account of the
secondary's fluctuating spin rate. The orbit period variations are typically
driven by two modes: a long-period and short-period, each with significant
amplitudes on the order of tens of seconds to several minutes. The fluctuating
orbit period offers both a challenge and an opportunity in the context of the
DART mission. Orbit period oscillations will make determining the post-impact
orbit period more difficult, but can also provide information about the

evolve the channels operate on still smaller spatial scales and much longer
time scales, culminating in a vast separation of characteristic lengths and
times that govern these explosive phenomena. In this article, we describe
implementation and tests of an efficient subgrid-scale model for generating
eruptive structures in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) coronal simulations. STITCH
-- STatistical InjecTion of Condensed Helicity -- is a physics-based, reduced
representation of helicity condensation: a process wherein small-scale vortical
surface convection forms ubiquitous current sheets, and pervasive reconnection
across the sheets mediates an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity and free
energy, thereby forming the filament channels. STITCH abstracts these complex
processes into a single new term, in the MHD Ohm's law and induction equation,
which directly injects tangential magnetic flux into the low corona. We show
that this approach is in very good agreement with a full helicity-condensation
calculation that treats all of the dynamics explicitly, while enabling
substantial reductions in temporal duration especially, but also in spatial
resolution. In addition, we illustrate the flexibility of STITCH at forming
localized filament channels and at energizing complex surface flux
distributions that have sinuous boundaries. STITCH is simple to implement and
computationally efficient, making it a powerful new technique for event-based,

ingredient in the theory of planet formation, is driven by viscous turbulence
or magnetic disk winds. As viscously evolving disks expand outward over time,
the evolution of disk sizes is a discriminant test for studying disk evolution.
However, it is unclear how the observed disk size changes over time if disk
evolution is driven by magnetic disk winds. Combining the thermochemical code
DALI with the analytical wind-driven disk evolution model presented in Tabone
et al. (2021a), we study the time evolution of the observed gas outer radius as
measured from CO rotational emission ($R_{\rm CO, 90\%}$). The evolution of
$R_{\rm CO, 90\%}$ is driven by the evolution of the disk mass, as the physical
radius stays constant over time. For a constant $\alpha_{\rm DW}$, an extension
of the $\alpha-$Shakura-Sunyaev parameter to wind-driven accretion, $R_{\rm CO,
90\%}$ decreases linearly with time. Its initial size is set by the disk mass
and the characteristic radius $R_c$, but only $R_c$ affects the evolution of
$R_{\rm CO, 90\%}$, with a larger $R_c$ resulting in a steeper decrease of
$R_{\rm CO, 90\%}$. For a time-dependent $\alpha_{\rm DW}$ $R_{\rm CO, 90\%}$
stays approximately constant during most of the disk lifetime until $R_{\rm CO,
90\%}$ rapidly shrinks as the disk dissipates. The constant $\alpha_{\rm
DW}$-models are able to reproduce the observed gas disk sizes in the $\sim1-3$
Lupus and $\sim5-11$ Myr old Upper Sco star-forming regions. However, they
likely overpredict the gas disk size of younger $(\lessapprox0.7\

analysis. Commonly employed strategies include the use of simulated events of
the background processes, and the fitting of parametric background models to
the observed data. However, reliable simulations are not always available or
may be extremely costly to produce. As a result, in many cases, uncertainties
associated with the accuracy or sample size of the simulation are the limiting
factor in the analysis sensitivity. At the same time, parametric models are
limited by the a priori unknown functional form and parameter values of the
background distribution. These issues become ever more pressing when large
datasets become available, as it is already the case at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider, and when studying exclusive signatures involving hadronic
backgrounds.
  Two novel and widely applicable non-parametric data-driven background
modelling techniques are presented, which address these issues for a broad
class of searches and measurements. The first, relying on ancestral sampling,
uses data from a relaxed event selection to estimate a graph of conditional
probability density functions of the variables used in the analysis, accounting
for significant correlations. A background model is then generated by sampling
events from this graph, before the full event selection is applied. In the
second, a generative adversarial network is trained to estimate the joint
probability density function of the variables used in the analysis. The
training is performed on a relaxed event selection which excludes the signal
region, and the network is conditioned on a blinding variable. Subsequently,
the conditional probability density function is interpolated into the signal
region to model the background. The application of each method on a benchmark
analysis is presented in detail, and the performance is discussed.

Furthermore, we propose a new regularizer that encourages consistent

establishes the superiority of FourierMix trained models at achieving
better-certified robustness guarantees under OOD shifts over the entire

The methods have evolved from image-intrinsic to object-inspired
(deep-learning-based) models. When a model fail, however, there is no
alternative to enhance its saliency map. We fill this gap by introducing a
hybrid approach, named \textit{Iterative Saliency Enhancement over Superpixel
Similarity} (ISESS), that iteratively generates enhanced saliency maps by
executing two operations alternately: object-based superpixel segmentation and
superpixel-based saliency estimation -- cycling operations never exploited.
ISESS estimates seeds for superpixel delineation from a given saliency map and
defines superpixel queries in the foreground and background. A new saliency map
results from color similarities between queries and superpixels at each
iteration. The process repeats and, after a given number of iterations, the
generated saliency maps are combined into one by cellular automata. Finally,
the resulting map is merged with the initial one by the maximum bewteen their
average values per superpixel. We demonstrate that our hybrid model can
consistently outperform three state-of-the-art deep-learning-based methods on
five image datasets.

task when the number of samples is insufficient to reliably estimate the
probability distribution. The Bayesian estimator of the property of interest
requires the knowledge of the prior distribution, and in many situations, it is
not clear which prior should be used. Several estimators have been developed so
far, in which the proposed prior was individually tailored for each property of
interest; such is the case, for example, for the entropy, the amount of mutual
information, or the correlation between pairs of variables. In this paper we
propose a general framework to select priors, valid for arbitrary properties.
We first demonstrate that only certain aspects of the prior distribution
actually affect the inference process. We then expand the sought prior as a
linear combination of a one-dimensional family of indexed priors, each of which
is obtained through a maximum entropy approach with constrained mean value of
the property under study. In many cases of interest, only one or very few
components of the expansion turn out to contribute to the Bayesian estimator,
so it is often valid to only keep a single component. The relevant component is
selected by the data, so no handcrafted priors are required. We test the
performance of this approximation with a few paradigmatic examples, and show
that it performs well in comparison to the ad-hoc methods previously proposed
in the literature. Our method highlights the connection between Bayesian
inference and equilibrium statistical mechanics, since the most relevant
component of the expansion can be argued to be the one with the right
temperature.

members of subpopulations. This problem arises in the analysis of randomized
controlled trials, in the analysis of A/B tests, and in the assessment of
fairness and bias in the treatment of sensitive subpopulations, especially when
measuring the effects of algorithms and machine learning. Often the comparison
makes the most sense when performed separately for individuals who are similar
according to certain characteristics given by the values of covariates of
interest; the separate comparisons can also be aggregated in various ways to
compare across all values of the covariates. Separating, segmenting, or
stratifying into those with similar values of the covariates is also known as
""conditioning on"" or ""controlling for"" those covariates; controlling for age or
annual income is common.
  Two standard methods of controlling for covariates are (1) binning and (2)
regression modeling. Binning requires making fairly arbitrary, yet frequently
highly influential choices, and is unsatisfactorily temperamental in multiple
dimensions, with multiple covariates. Regression analysis works wonderfully
when there is good reason to believe in a particular parameterized regression
model or classifier (such as logistic regression). Thus, there appears to be no
extant canonical fully non-parametric regression for the comparison of
subpopulations, not while conditioning on multiple specified covariates.
Existing methods rely on analysts to make choices, and those choices can be
debatable; analysts can deceive others or even themselves. The present paper
aims to fill the gap, combining two ingredients: (1) recently developed
methodologies for such comparisons that already exist when conditioning on a
single scalar covariate and (2) the Hilbert space-filling curve that maps
continuously from one dimension to multiple dimensions.

permutation $\pi:V\to V$ is proportional to the number of non-fixed-points of

utility of robustly self-ordered graphs.
  We show that robustly self-ordered bounded-degree graphs exist (in
abundance), and that they can be constructed efficiently, in a strong sense.
Specifically, given the index of a vertex in such a graph, it is possible to
find all its neighbors in polynomial-time (i.e., in time that is
poly-logarithmic in the size of the graph).
  We also consider graphs of unbounded degree, seeking correspondingly
unbounded robustness parameters. We again demonstrate that such graphs (of
linear degree) exist (in abundance), and that they can be constructed
efficiently, in a strong sense. This turns out to require very different tools.
Specifically, we show that the construction of such graphs reduces to the
construction of non-malleable two-source extractors (with very weak parameters
but with some additional natural features).
  We demonstrate that robustly self-ordered bounded-degree graphs are useful
towards obtaining lower bounds on the query complexity of testing graph
properties both in the bounded-degree and the dense graph models. One of the
results that we obtain, via such a reduction, is a subexponential separation
between the query complexities of testing and tolerant testing of graph
properties in the bounded-degree graph model.

all their types. However, observational data suggests that the SNe could be not
spherically-symmetric. Modern multi-dimensional simulations of SNe demonstrate
development of hydrodynamical instabilities during the explosion phase. But the
configuration of a star and inhomogeneities prior to explosion could strongly
affect how the SNe develops. In a number of papers on numerical modeling of
pair-instability supernovae explosion (PISNe) considered the case when
thermonuclear energy in the central region of a massive star is introduced by
the series of several hot spots. It leads to the appearance of many fragments
of hot matter behind the divergence shock wave. An observable manifestation of
this may be the presence of peaks on light curves of gamma-ray burst associated
with explosions of massive stars.
  The physical nature of such inhomogeneities is not evident and the number and
size of spots is a conjecture. In this work, we study the possibility of
formation of these inhomogeneities at the stage of the core-collapse (CC) in a
massive star. To check this assumption, we chose analytic self-similar model of
CC and investigated stability of solutions obtained from it with respect to
small multidimensional perturbations. It shows there are no conditions where
the collapse of a very massive star may remain stable, although, for a less
massive star, it is possible. Using obtained relations, we found characteristic
features of developing instability, thereby making it possible to estimate the
amount and characteristic size of the inhomogeneities.

serve as a photoswitchable aligning surface for preorientation of low molecular
weight liquid crystals in a bulk. The brush is built by grafting the polymer
chains of a side-chain molecular architecture, with the side chains terminated
by a chromophore unit mimicking the azobenzene unit, to a substrate. When
irradiated with ultraviolet light, the chromophores photoisomerize into a
non-mesogenic cis state and the whole system turns into an ordinary polymer
brush with no orientational order and two states: the collapsed and
straightened one, depending on the grafting density. When irradiated with
visible light, the chromophores photoisomerize into a mesogenic trans state,
resulting in formation of a transient network between chains because of a
strong attraction between chromophores. Spontaneous self-assembly of the brush
in these conditions results in an orientationally isotropic polydomain
structure. The desired uniaxial planar ordering of chromophores within a brush
can be achieved at certain temperature and grafting density intervals, as the
result of a two-stage preparation protocol. An external stimulus orients
chromophores uniaxially at the first stage. The system is equilibrated at the
second stage at a given temperature and with the external stimulus switched
off. The preoriented chromophores either keep or loose their orientations
depending on the strength of the memory effect inherent to a transient network
of chains that are formed during the first stage, similarly to the case of the
liquid crystalline elastomers, where such effects are caused by the covalent

energy loss of high-energy jets traversing hot QCD medium on a jet-by-jet
basis. The average amount of quenching of quark and gluon jets in hot QCD
medium actually have different characteristics, such as their dependence on the
in-medium traversed length and the early-developed jet substructures in the
evolution. These observations motivate us to consider these two types of jets
separately and classify them from jet images with deep learning techniques. We
find that the classification performance gradually decreases with increasing
degree of jet modification. In addition, we discuss the predictive power of
different jet observables, such as the jet shape, jet fragmentation function,
jet substructures as well as their combinations, in order to address the
interpretability of the classification task.

controversial. YbMnBi2 is regarded as a candidate of Type-II Weyl semimetals
with magnetic moments of Mn atoms canting about 10{\deg} in some studies but as
a Dirac semimetal without canting in others. By means of systematical density
functional theory calculations, we show the perfect YbMnBi2 bulk has a
collinear antiferromagnetic ordering and, naturally, it is a Dirac semimetal.
Considering the vital role of magnetic moment canting in generating the Type-II
Weyl state, we artificially cant the magnetic moments of Mn atoms and find that
YbMnBi2 enters into the Type-II Weyl state from about 2{\deg}. Inspired by this
and taking into account the possible defects in experiments, we suggest that Bi
vacancies in Mn-Bi-Mn bonds, which produce sizable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions and thereby cant the magnetic moments of Mn atoms, can tune the
topological nature of YbMnBi2 from Dirac semimetals to Type-II Weyl semimetals.
Our work unveils the possible underlying mechanism for the Type-II Weyl state
in YbMnBi2, providing insights into the Weyl state in other magnetic

Brain Oversight to Raise Generalization (CYBORG). This new approach
incorporates human-annotated saliency maps into a loss function that guides the

unseen samples consisting of face images generated from six Generative

also show that scaling to even seven times the training data, or using
non-human-saliency auxiliary information, such as segmentation masks, and
standard loss cannot beat the performance of CYBORG-trained models. As a side
effect of this work, we observe that the addition of explicit region annotation

$x_{\max}$ in a $N$-particle Riesz gas in one dimension confined in a harmonic
trap. The particles interact via long-range repulsive potential, of the form
$r^{-k}$ with $-2<k<\infty$ where $r$ is the inter-particle distance. In
equilibrium at temperature $O(1)$, the gas settles on a finite length scale
$L_N$ that depends on $N$ and $k$. We numerically observe that the typical
fluctuation of $y_{\max} = x_{\max}/L_N$ around its mean is of
$O(N^{-\eta_k})$. Over this length scale, the distribution of the typical

challenge. In this work, we intend to address the question: can we leverage
semi-supervised learning techniques on music emotion recognition? With that, we
experiment with noisy student training, which has improved model performance in
the image classification domain. As the noisy student method requires a strong
teacher model, we further delve into the factors including (i) input training
length and (ii) complementary music representations to further boost the
performance of the teacher model. For (i), we find that models trained with
short input length perform better in PR-AUC, whereas those trained with long
input length perform better in ROC-AUC. For (ii), we find that using harmonic
pitch class profiles (HPCP) consistently improve tagging performance, which
suggests that harmonic representation is useful for music emotion tagging.
Finally, we find that noisy student method only improves tagging results for
the case of long training length. Additionally, we find that ensembling
representations trained with different training lengths can improve tagging
results significantly, which suggest a possible direction to explore
incorporating multiple temporal resolutions in the network architecture for
future work.

high dimensions. We are given samples from a mixture of $k$ identity covariance
Gaussians, so that the minimum pairwise distance between any two pairs of means
is at least $\Delta$, for some parameter $\Delta > 0$, and the goal is to
recover the ground truth clustering of these samples. It is folklore that
separation $\Delta = \Theta (\sqrt{\log k})$ is both necessary and sufficient
to recover a good clustering, at least information theoretically. However, the
estimators which achieve this guarantee are inefficient. We give the first
algorithm which runs in polynomial time, and which almost matches this
guarantee. More precisely, we give an algorithm which takes polynomially many
samples and time, and which can successfully recover a good clustering, so long
as the separation is $\Delta = \Omega (\log^{1/2 + c} k)$, for any $c > 0$.
Previously, polynomial time algorithms were only known for this problem when
the separation was polynomial in $k$, and all algorithms which could tolerate
$\textsf{poly}( \log k )$ separation required quasipolynomial time. We also
extend our result to mixtures of translations of a distribution which satisfies
the Poincar\'{e} inequality, under additional mild assumptions. Our main

  Dewar experiment","21 pages, 9 figures",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dark matter which scatters off ordinary matter with a relatively large cross
section cannot be constrained by deep underground WIMP experiments, due to the
energy loss of DM along its path. However, for a sufficiently large cross
section, DM particles in the GeV mass range can be captured and thermalized
within Earth, resulting in the accumulation of a DM atmosphere whose number
density can be as large as $10^{14} \text{ cm}^{-3}$ at Earth's surface. (If
the DM-nucleon interaction is attractive and bound states can be formed, most
DM bind to nuclei and the density is much lower.)
  Neufeld and Brach-Neufeld performed experiments to constrain the DM-baryon
scattering cross section of DM atmosphere around Earth, by measuring the
evaporation rate of liquid nitrogen in a storage dewar within which various
materials are immersed. If the DM-nitrogen cross section is in an appropriate
range, room temperature DM would penetrate the dewar walls and scatter on the
cold nitrogen, increasing its evaporation rate beyond the observed level.
Limits on the cross section of DM with other materials than nitrogen are
obtained by adding known amounts of different materials; if the material is
heated by interactions with DM, that heats and evaporates the liquid nitrogen.
  Because Born approximation is in general invalid in much of the relevant
cross section regime, it is non-trivial to interpret such experimental results
as a limit on the DM-nucleon cross section. In this paper we derive the
constraints on DM-baryon scattering, with the interaction modeled as a Yukawa
potential sourced by the finite sized nucleus. Combining the dewar constraints
with BBN, we exclude for the first time a cross section above $10^{-26} \text{
cm}^{2}$ for DM mass 0.8-5.5 GeV, for any sign interaction. One DM model that
is constrained is sexaquark $(uuddss)$ DM with mass $m_X \sim 2$ GeV; it
remains viable.

limiting magnitude $M_r$=-11.5 mag, and at the mean effective surface

scaling relations for dwarf galaxies and compare them with other nearby
clusters. We find that there are no observational differences for dwarfs
scaling relations in clusters of different sizes. We study the spatial
distribution of galaxies, finding evidence for the presence of substructures
within half the virial radius. We also find that mid- and high-luminosity
dwarfs ($M_r$<-14.5 mag) become on average redder toward the cluster center,
and that they have a mild increase in $R_e$ with increasing clustercentric
distance, similar to what is observed for the Fornax cluster. No clear

with mathematical models to quantify the uncertainty in the solution of the
inverse problem. However, the solution of Bayesian inverse problems governed by
complex forward models described by partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains prohibitive with black-box Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
present hIPPYlib-MUQ, an extensible and scalable software framework that
contains implementations of state-of-the art algorithms aimed to overcome the
challenges of high-dimensional, PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems.
These algorithms accelerate MCMC sampling by exploiting the geometry and
intrinsic low-dimensionality of parameter space via derivative information and
low rank approximation. The software integrates two complementary open-source
software packages, hIPPYlib and MUQ. hIPPYlib solves PDE-constrained inverse
problems using automatically-generated adjoint-based derivatives, but it lacks
full Bayesian capabilities. MUQ provides a spectrum of powerful Bayesian
inversion models and algorithms, but expects forward models to come equipped
with gradients and Hessians to permit large-scale solution. By combining these
two libraries, we created a robust, scalable, and efficient software framework
that realizes the benefits of each and allows us to tackle complex large-scale
Bayesian inverse problems. To illustrate the capabilities of hIPPYlib-MUQ, we
present a comparison of a number of MCMC methods on several inverse problems.
These include problems with linear and nonlinear PDEs, various noise models,
and different parameter dimensions. The results demonstrate that large ($\sim
50\times$) speedups over conventional black box and gradient-based MCMC
algorithms can be obtained by exploiting Hessian information (from the log
posterior), underscoring the power of the integrated hIPPYlib-MUQ framework.

the adversarial training between a generator (G) and a discriminator (D). They
are expected to reach a certain equilibrium where D cannot distinguish the
generated images from the real ones. However, such an equilibrium is rarely
achieved in practical GAN training, instead, D almost always surpasses G. We
attribute one of its sources to the information asymmetry between D and G. We
observe that D learns its own visual attention when determining whether an
image is real or fake, but G has no explicit clue on which regions to focus on
for a particular synthesis. To alleviate the issue of D dominating the
competition in GANs, we aim to raise the spatial awareness of G. Randomly
sampled multi-level heatmaps are encoded into the intermediate layers of G as
an inductive bias. Thus G can purposefully improve the synthesis of certain
image regions. We further propose to align the spatial awareness of G with the
attention map induced from D. Through this way we effectively lessen the
information gap between D and G. Extensive results show that our method pushes
the two-player game in GANs closer to the equilibrium, leading to a better
synthesis performance. As a byproduct, the introduced spatial awareness
facilitates interactive editing over the output synthesis. Demo video and code

radio emission poses crucial challenges in experiments aiming to measure the
21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of
Reionization. If not included in calibration, this diffuse emission can
severely impact the analysis and signal extraction in 21-cm experiments. We
examine large-scale diffuse Galactic emission at 122~MHz, around the North
Celestial Pole, using the AARTFAAC-HBA system. Methods: In this pilot project,
we present the first-ever wide-field image produced with a single sub-band of
the data recorded with the AARTFAAC-HBA. We demonstrate two methods: multiscale
CLEAN and shapelet decomposition, to model the diffuse emission revealed in the
image. We use angular power spectrum metrics to quantify different components
of the emission and compare the performance of the two diffuse structure
modelling approaches. Results: We observe that the point sources dominate the
angular power spectrum ($\ell(\ell+1)C_{\ell}/2\pi\equiv \Delta^2(\ell)$) of
the emission in the field on scales $\ell\gtrsim 60$ ($\lesssim 3$~degree). The
angular power spectrum after subtraction of compact sources is flat within
$20\lesssim \ell \lesssim200$ range, suggesting that the residual power is
dominated by the diffuse emission on scales $\ell\lesssim200$. The residual
diffuse emission has a brightness temperature variance of $\Delta^2_{\ell=180}
= (145.64 \pm 13.61)~{\rm K}^2$ at 122~MHz on angular scales of 1~degree, and
is consistent with a power-law following $C_{\ell}\propto \ell^{-2.0}$ in
$20\lesssim \ell \lesssim200$ range. We also find that, in the current setup,
the multiscale CLEAN is suitable to model the compact and diffuse structures on
a wide range of angular scales, whereas the shapelet decomposition method
better models the large scales, which are of the order of a few degrees and
wider.

contributing to the performance differences while separating the contributions
from hardware upgrades, support for shorter anneal times, and possible
optimization of ferromagnetic couplings. While shorter anneal times can improve
the time to solution (TTS) at any given problem size, the scaling of TTS with
respect to the problem size worsens for shorter anneal times. In contrast,
optimizing the ferromagnetic coupling improves both the absolute TTS and the
scaling. There is a statistically significant improvement in performance
between D-Wave Two and 2X and from all older generation annealers to Advantage,
even when operated under identical anneal time and ferromagnetic couplings.
However, the performance improvement from 2X to 2000Q requires the anneal time

identical to those of the well-studied $2+1$d XY transition. Our formalism
predicts a ""level-shift"" symmetry: in the absence of an applied gauge field,
the bulk correlation functions of all local operators are identical for models
differing by the topological term. %, for example, near the SF-MI and SF-tMI
transitions, and hence the extremely well-studied critical exponents of the

the phase transition into the SF phase. Our formalism paves the way for other
exact lattice descriptions of symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) phases, and
mappings of critical exponents between transitions from symmetry-breaking to
trivial states and transitions from symmetry-breaking to SPT states. A similar

evaporation efficiency to plummet with increasing $\phi_p$,. Whether or not
planets with $\phi_p\lesssim \phi_p^{\rm thr}$ exhibit energy-limited outflows

low-gravity planets, above $F_{\rm XUV}\simeq 10^{4-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$

efficiency of low-gravity planets drops below the energy-limited approximation,

$\eta$ increases as $F_{\rm XUV}$ increases for planets above $\phi^{\rm

understood by examining the relative fractional contributions of advective and
radiative losses as a function of atmospheric temperature. This novel framework
enables a reliable, physically motivated prediction of the expected evaporation
efficiency for a given planetary system; an analytical approximation of the
best-fitting $\eta$ is given in the appendix.

emitted from the boundary in a warped background. We also derive a formula for
the Casimir pressure on a $(d-1)$-brane depending only on the boundary-to-bulk

holographic basis, we evaluate the one-loop boundary effective action in AdS by
means of the heat kernel expansion. We extract anomalous dimensions of single

nonabelian vectors, up to third order in the large squared mass expansion. From
the boundary heat kernel coefficients we identify CFT operator mixing and
corrections to OPE data, in addition to the radiative generation of local

dS$_4$ effective action which renormalizes the cosmological correlators. We
find that bulk masses and wavefunction can logarithmically run as a result of

explore the broader question of how systems like Kepler-167 form in the pebble
accretion framework for giant planet core formation. We utilize simple disk
evolution models to demonstrate that more massive and metal-rich disks, which
are the most favorable sites for giant planet formation, can also deliver
enough solids to the inner disk to form systems of super-Earths. We use these
same models to constrain the nature of Kepler-167's protoplanetary disk, and
find that it likely contained $\gtrsim 300$ M$_{\oplus}$ of dust and was
$\gtrsim 40$ au in size. These values overlap with the upper end of the
observed dust mass and size distributions of Class 0 and I disks, and are also

field theories (CFTs) has a long history, ranging from the description of
impurities in one-dimensional quantum chains to the formulation of D-branes in
string theory. Nevertheless, the landscape of conformal boundaries is largely
unknown, including in rational CFTs, where the local operator data is
completely determined. We initiate a systematic bootstrap study of conformal
boundaries in 2d CFTs by investigating the bootstrap equation that arises from
the open-closed consistency condition of the annulus partition function with
identical boundaries. We find that this deceivingly simple bootstrap equation,
when combined with unitarity, leads to surprisingly strong constraints on
admissible boundary states. In particular, we derive universal bounds on the
tension (boundary entropy) of stable boundary conditions, which provide a
rigorous diagnostic for potential D-brane decays. We also find unique solutions
to the bootstrap problem of stable branes in a number of rational CFTs. Along
the way, we observe a curious connection between the annulus bootstrap and the
sphere packing problem, which is a natural extension of previous work on the
modular bootstrap. We also derive bounds on the boundary entropy at large
central charge. These potentially have implications for end-of-the-world branes
in pure gravity on AdS$_3$.

by RDI-excited Alfv{\'e}n waves, with the growth rate of the CR perpendicular

These rates are well-predicted by analytic linear theory. CRs finally become
isotropized and drift at least at $\sim v_\mathrm{A}$ by unidirectional
Alfv\'{e}n waves excited by the RDIs, with a uniform distribution of the pitch

Way is significantly lower compared to its prograde counterpart. Chemical and
dynamical evidence suggests that the retrograde stellar population originates
from $\omega$ Centauri, which is either the most massive globular cluster (GC)
of the Milky Way or the putative core of a former dwarf galaxy. Aims. Star
formation conditions required to produce the retrograde binary population are
constrained assuming that the retrograde stellar population originates from
$\omega$ Centauri's progenitor. Methods. We match the observed low binary
fraction with dynamical population synthesis models, including a universal
initial binary population and dynamical processing in star clusters, making use
of the publicly available binary population synthesis tool BiPoS1. Results. It
is found that either the GC progenitor of $\omega$ Centauri must have formed
with a stellar density of $\approx 10^8 \; M_{sun} \; pc^{-3}$ or the $\omega$
Centauri dwarf galaxy's progenitor star cluster population must have formed in
an extreme starburst with a star formation rate exceeding $1000 \; M_{sun} \;

suppressed low-mass cluster formation. The separation and mass ratio

In this paper we present follow-up Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) observations of one source, NGC3100, targeting the $^{12}$CO(1-0),
$^{12}$CO(3-2), HCO$^{+}$(4-3), SiO(3-2) and HNCO(6-5) molecular transitions.
$^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(3-2) lines are nicely detected and complement our
previous $^{12}$CO(2-1) data. By comparing the relative strength of these three
CO transitions, we find extreme gas excitation conditions (i.e. $T_{\rm
ex}\gtrsim50$ K) in regions that are spatially correlated with the radio lobes,
supporting the case for a jet-ISM interaction. An accurate study of the CO
kinematics demonstrates that, although the bulk of the gas is regularly
rotating, two distinct non-rotational kinematic components can be identified in
the inner gas regions: one can be associated to inflow/outflow streaming
motions induced by a two-armed spiral perturbation; the second one is
consistent with a jet-induced outflow with $v_{\rm max}\approx 200$ km s$^{-1}$
and $\dot{M}\lesssim 0.12$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. These values indicate that
the jet-CO coupling ongoing in NGC3100 is only mildly affecting the gas
kinematics, as opposed to what expected from existing simulations and other
observational studies of (sub-)kpc scale jet-cold gas interactions.
HCO$^{+}$(4-3) emission is tentatively detected in a small area adjacent to the
base of the northern radio lobe, possibly tracing a region of jet-induced gas
compression. The SiO(3-2) and HNCO(6-5) shock tracers are undetected: this -
along with the tentative HCO$^{+}$(4-3) detection - may be consistent with a
deficiency of very dense (i.e. $n_{\rm crit} > 10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) cold gas in
the central regions of NGC3100.

Majorana nanowires setups have similar experimental signatures which make them
hard to distinguishing one from the other. Here, we characterize the continuous
Majorana/Andreev crossover interpolating between fully-separated,
partially-separated, and fully-overlapping Majorana modes, in terms of global
and local topological invariants, fermion parity, quasiparticle densities,
Majorana pseudospin and spin polarizations, density overlaps and transition
probabilities between opposite Majorana components. We found that in
inhomogeneous wires, the transition between fully-overlapping trivial ABS and
nontrivial MBS does not necessarily mandate the closing of the bulk gap of
quasiparticle excitations, but a simple parity crossing of partially-separated
Majorana modes (ps-MM) from trivial to nontrivial regimes. We demonstrate that
fully-separated and fully-overlapping Majorana modes correspond to the two
limiting cases at the opposite sides of a continuous crossover: the only
distinction between the two can be obtained by estimating the degree of
separations of the Majorana components. This result does not contradict the
bulk-edge correspondence: Indeed, the field inhomogeneities driving the
Majorana/Andreev crossover have a length scale comparable with the nanowire
length, and therefore correspond to a nonlocal perturbation which breaks the
topological protection of the MBS.

complex substructures. Most of the previous studies use static potentials to
investigate their origins. Instead we use a self-consistent $N$-body model of
the Milky Way, whose potential is asymmetric and evolves with time. In this
paper, we quantitatively evaluate the similarities of the velocity-space
distributions in the $N$-body model and that of the solar neighbourhood, using
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). The KLD analysis shows the time evolution
and spatial variation of the velocity-space distribution. The KLD fluctuates
with time, which indicates the velocity-space distribution at a fixed position
is not always similar to that of the solar neighbourhood. Some positions show
velocity-space distributions with small KLDs (high similarities) more
frequently than others. One of them locates at $(R,\phi)=(8.2\;\mathrm{kpc},
30^{\circ})$, where $R$ and $\phi$ are the distance from the galactic centre
and the angle with respect to the bar's major axis, respectively. The detection
frequency is higher in the inter-arm regions than in the arm regions. In the
velocity maps with small KLDs, we identify the velocity-space substructures,
which consist of particles trapped in bar resonances. The bar resonances have
significant impact on the stellar velocity-space distribution even though the
galactic potential is not static.

expansion to define non-perturbative physics. It is offered as a simple and
(hopefully) clear framework within which any proposed non-perturbative
definition should fit, and hence be readily compared to others. Some minimal
requirements for constructing consistent non-perturbative formulations are
emphasized. A family of non-perturbative completions emerges from this, which
includes an earlier construction. End-of-the-World branes, or simply D-branes,
emerge straightforwardly in this framework and play a natural role. The
many-body fermion picture of the matrix model is a key organizing motif, with
many features highly analogous to a quantum black hole system, including a size
that grows with the number of its microscopic constituents and a locus (the
Fermi surface) beyond which quantities are traced over in order to define the
physics. A formula for the thermal density matrix is proposed that allows a von
Neumann form for the entropy to be written in matrix model terms.

of a vacuum first-order phase transition that is triggered by a subdominant
scalar field at zero temperature. With hot NEDE, we introduce a new mechanism
to trigger the phase transition. It relies on thermal corrections that subside
as a subdominant radiation fluid in a dark gauge sector cools. We explore the
phenomenology of hot NEDE and identify the strong supercooled regime as the
scenario favored by phenomenology. In a second step, we propose different
microscopic embeddings of hot NEDE. This includes the (non-)Abelian dark matter

interactions with the dark radiation fluid. We also address the coincidence
problem generically present in EDE models by relating NEDE to the mass
generation of neutrinos via the inverse seesaw mechanism. We finally propose a
more complete dark sector model, which embeds the NEDE field in a larger
symmetry group and discuss the possibility that the hot NEDE field is central
for spontaneously breaking lepton number symmetry.

driven by several processes, such as mergers, accretion and feedback from
active galactic nuclei. X-ray surface brightness fluctuations have been used to
constrain turbulence in galaxy clusters. Here, we use simulations to further
investigate the relation between gas density and turbulent velocity
fluctuations, with a focus on the effect of the stratification of the ICM. In
this work, we studied the turbulence driven by hierarchical accretion by
analysing a sample of galaxy clusters simulated with the cosmological code
ENZO. We used a fixed scale filtering approach to disentangle laminar from
turbulent flows. In dynamically perturbed galaxy clusters, we found a relation
between the root mean square of density and velocity fluctuations, albeit with
a different slope than previously reported. The Richardson number is a
parameter that represents the ratio between turbulence and buoyancy, and we
found that this variable has a strong dependence on the filtering scale.
However, we could not detect any strong relation between the Richardson number
and the logarithmic density fluctuations, in contrast to results by recent and
more idealised simulations. In particular, we find a strong effect from radial
accretion, which appears to be the main driver for the gas fluctuations. The
ubiquitous radial bias in the dynamics of the ICM suggests that homogeneity and
isotropy are not always valid assumptions, even if the turbulent spectra follow
Kolmogorov's scaling. Finally, we find that the slope of the velocity and
density spectra are independent of cluster-centric radii.

allows for training neural architectures based on different modalities such as

need to jointly learn semantic concepts and their relationships across
different input representations. Capsule networks have been shown to perform
well in context of capturing the relation between low-level input features and
higher-level concepts. However, capsules have so far mainly been used only in
small-scale fully supervised settings due to the resource demand of
conventional routing algorithms. We present a new multimodal capsule network
that allows us to leverage the strength of capsules in the context of a
multimodal learning framework on large amounts of video data. To adapt the
capsules to large-scale input data, we propose a novel routing by
self-attention mechanism that selects relevant capsules which are then used to
generate a final joint multimodal feature representation. This allows not only
for robust training with noisy video data, but also to scale up the size of the
capsule network compared to traditional routing methods while still being
computationally efficient. We evaluate the proposed architecture by pretraining
it on a large-scale multimodal video dataset and applying it on four datasets
in two challenging downstream tasks. Results show that the proposed multimodal
capsule network is not only able to improve results compared to other routing
techniques, but also achieves competitive performance on the task of multimodal

observational biases may account for this dearth of small planets, in this
paper we propose a theoretical explanation. Most of the known planets are near
the stability limit, interspersed between potentially unstable 5 : 1, 6 : 1 and
7 : 1 mean motion resonances with the binary. It is believed that these planets
did not form in situ, but rather migrated from farther out in the disc, and
hence passed through these resonances. Planets are expected to migrate at a
speed proportional to their mass, and a slower rate makes resonant capture and
subsequent ejection more likely. Therefore, whilst large planets may be able to
successfully ""run the gauntlet"", small planets may be imperiled. This
hypothesis is tested using N-body integrations of migration in a truncated and
turbulent disc. We discover that surprisingly none of the known planets exist
interior to a fully unstable resonance. We demonstrate that resonant ejection
of migrating planets may occur in nature, and that it does indeed
disproportionately affect small planets, but it requires a highly turbulent
disc and its efficiency is likely too low to fully explain a dearth of < 3
Earth radii planets.

the contribution of thermal emission from the accretion disc for FSRQs. In
analysing the colour behaviour on shorter time windows, we find many blazars
evince shorter partial trends of BWB or RWB nature (or occasionally both). Some
of such complex colour behaviours observed in the colour-magnitude diagrams of

the determinant. For any nonzero polynomial $f$ in this ideal, we construct a
small depth-three $f$-oracle circuit that approximates the determinant of size
$\Theta(r^{1/3})$ in the sense of border complexity. For many classes of
algebraic circuits, this implies that every nonzero polynomial in the ideal
generated by $r \times r$ minors is at least as hard to approximately compute
as the determinant of size $\Theta(r^{1/3})$. We also prove an analogous result
for the Pfaffian of a $2n \times 2n$ skew-symmetric matrix and the ideal
generated by Pfaffians of $2r \times 2r$ principal submatrices.
  This answers a recent question of Grochow about complexity in polynomial

result, two of which are highlighted below.
  $\bullet$ We prove super-polynomial lower bounds for Ideal Proof System

breakthrough low-depth circuit lower bounds of Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas

that the approximative proof complexity of our hard instance is governed by the
approximative circuit complexity of the determinant.
  $\bullet$ We construct new hitting set generators for polynomial-size
low-depth circuits. For any $\varepsilon > 0$, we construct generators with
seed length $O(n^\varepsilon)$ that attain a near-optimal tradeoff between
their seed length and degree, and are computable by low-depth circuits of
near-linear size (with respect to the size of their output). This matches the
seed length of the generators recently obtained by Limaye, Srinivasan, and
Tavenas, but improves on the generator's degree and circuit complexity.

problems in AI since its inception and is a challenge at the core of

computationally hard, and despite steady effort since the 1960's, breakthroughs
have only been made on the problem within the past few years, primarily on the
problem of finding optimal sparse decision trees. However, current
state-of-the-art algorithms often require impractical amounts of computation
time and memory to find optimal or near-optimal trees for some real-world

that the search spaces of these decision tree optimization problems are
massive, can we practically hope to find a sparse decision tree that competes

via smart guessing strategies that can be applied to any optimal
branch-and-bound-based decision tree algorithm. We show that by using these
guesses, we can reduce the run time by multiple orders of magnitude, while
providing bounds on how far the resulting trees can deviate from the black
box's accuracy and expressive power. Our approach enables guesses about how to
bin continuous features, the size of the tree, and lower bounds on the error
for the optimal decision tree. Our experiments show that in many cases we can
rapidly construct sparse decision trees that match the accuracy of black box
models. To summarize: when you are having trouble optimizing, just guess.

also reveals deviations from this well-established model manifested in an
asymmetric level spectrum and energy shifts of the boundary states. The
deviations arise because the dots are charged and hence lead to an onsite

mitigated by electrostatic gating using auxiliary charged adatoms, enabling
fine-tuning of the boundary states and control of their quantum superposition.

under a sustained treatment strategy. When treatment strategies are
deterministic, estimators derived from the so-called efficient influence
function (EIF) for the g-formula will be doubly robust to model
misspecification. In recent years, several practical applications have
motivated estimation of the g-formula under non-deterministic treatment
strategies where treatment assignment at each time point depends on the
observed treatment process. In this case, EIF-based estimators may or may not
be doubly robust. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions to ensure
existence of doubly robust estimators for intervention treatment distributions
that depend on the observed treatment process for point treatment
interventions, and give a class of intervention treatment distributions
dependent on the observed treatment process that guarantee model doubly and
multiply robust estimators in longitudinal settings. Motivated by an
application to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation studies, we propose a
new treatment intervention dependent on the observed treatment process. We show
there exist 1) estimators that are doubly and multiply robust to model
misspecification, and 2) estimators that when used with machine learning
algorithms can attain fast convergence rates for our proposed intervention.
Theoretical results are confirmed via simulation studies.

of first-order phase transitions at temperatures below the critical. We
analyzed the mechanism of these transitions based on the behavior of the
chemical potential as a function of density. Thus we found the points of phase
coexistence without going beyond the microscopic approach. We also proposed a
mathematically strict definition of the critical temperature as a function of
the microscopic parameters of the model. We determined the parameters of the

on dequantization compare quantum algorithms which take copies of an n-qubit
quantum state $|x\rangle = \sum_{i} x_i |i\rangle$ as input to classical
algorithms which have sample and query (SQ) access to the vector $x$. In this
note, we prove that classical algorithms with SQ access can accomplish some
learning tasks exponentially faster than quantum algorithms with quantum state
inputs. Because classical algorithms are a subset of quantum algorithms, this
demonstrates that SQ access can sometimes be significantly more powerful than
quantum state inputs. Our findings suggest that the absence of exponential
quantum advantage in some learning tasks may be due to SQ access being too
powerful relative to quantum state inputs. If we compare quantum algorithms
with quantum state inputs to classical algorithms with access to measurement
data on quantum states, the landscape of quantum advantage can be dramatically
different. We remark that when the quantum states are constructed from
exponential-size classical data, comparing SQ access and quantum state inputs
is appropriate since both require exponential time to prepare.

fairness: to what extent can the error experienced by one agent be

appropriate in different circumstances: ""egalitarian fairness"" (which aims to
bound how dissimilar error rates can be) and ""proportional fairness"" (which
aims to reward players for contributing more data). We similarly consider two
common methods of model aggregation, one where a single model is created for
all agents (uniform), and one where an individualized model is created for each
agent. For egalitarian fairness, we obtain a tight multiplicative bound on how
widely error rates can diverge between agents collaborating (which holds for
both aggregation methods). For proportional fairness, we show that the
individualized aggregation method always gives a small player error that is
upper bounded by proportionality. For uniform aggregation, we show that this
upper bound is guaranteed for any individually rational coalition (where no
player wishes to leave to do local learning).

efficiently process large scene depths which are inherent to oblique imagery
captured by low-flying UAVs. The actual depth estimation employs a plane-sweep
algorithm for dense multi-image matching to produce depth hypotheses from which
the actual depth map is extracted by means of a surface-aware semi-global
optimization, reducing the fronto-parallel bias of SGM. Given the estimated
depth map, the pixel-wise surface normal information is then computed by
reprojecting the depth map into a point cloud and calculating the normal
vectors within a confined local neighborhood. In a thorough quantitative and
ablative study we show that the accuracies of the 3D information calculated by
FaSS-MVS is close to that of state-of-the-art approaches for offline multi-view
stereo, with the error not even being one magnitude higher than that of COLMAP.
At the same time, however, the average run-time of FaSS-MVS to estimate a

Starobinsky $f(R)$ model \cite{Starobinsky2007}, using updated measurements
from the dynamics of the expansion of the universe, $H(z)$; and the growth rate
of cosmic structures, $[f\sigma_8](z)$, where the distinction between the
concordance $\Lambda $CDM model and modified gravity models $f(R)$ becomes
clearer. We use MCMC likelihood analyses to explore the parameters space of the
$f(R)$ model using $H(z)$ and $[f\sigma_8](z)$ data, both individually and
jointly, and further, examine which of the models best fits the joint data. To
further test the Starobinsky model, we use a method proposed by Linder
\cite{Linder2017}, where the data from the observables is jointly binned in
redshift space. This allows to further explore the model's parameter that
better fits the data in comparison to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The joint
analysis of $H(z)$ and $[f\sigma_8](z)$ show that the $n=2$--Starobinsky $f(R)$
model fits well the observational data. In the end, we confirm that this joint
analysis is able to break the degenerescence between modified gravity models as
proposed in the original work \cite{Starobinsky2007}. Our results indicate that
the $f(R)$ Starobinsky model provides a good fit to the currently available
data for a set of values of its parameters, being, therefore, a possible
alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM model.

  precursors of extreme events",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many scientific and engineering problems require accurate models of dynamical
systems with rare and extreme events. Such problems present a challenging task
for data-driven modelling, with many naive machine learning methods failing to
predict or accurately quantify such events. One cause for this difficulty is
that systems with extreme events, by definition, yield imbalanced datasets and
that standard loss functions easily ignore rare events. That is, metrics for
goodness of fit used to train models are not designed to ensure accuracy on
rare events. This work seeks to improve the performance of regression models
for extreme events by considering loss functions designed to highlight
outliers. We propose a novel loss function, the adjusted output weighted loss,
and extend the applicability of relative entropy based loss functions to
systems with low dimensional output. The proposed functions are tested using
several cases of dynamical systems exhibiting extreme events and shown to
significantly improve accuracy in predictions of extreme events.

would be useful to bring into our trained models while still allowing them to
learn in a data-driven fashion. To achieve this, we present the new method of
interchange intervention training (IIT). In IIT, we (1) align variables in a
causal model (e.g., a deterministic program or Bayesian network) with
representations in a neural model and (2) train the neural model to match the
counterfactual behavior of the causal model on a base input when aligned
representations in both models are set to be the value they would be for a
source input. IIT is fully differentiable, flexibly combines with other
objectives, and guarantees that the target causal model is a causal abstraction
of the neural model when its loss is zero. We evaluate IIT on a structural
vision task (MNIST-PVR), a navigational language task (ReaSCAN), and a natural
language inference task (MQNLI). We compare IIT against multi-task training
objectives and data augmentation. In all our experiments, IIT achieves the best
results and produces neural models that are more interpretable in the sense
that they more successfully realize the target causal model.

  We provide the first strong lower bounds on the error of continual release
mechanisms. In particular, for two fundamental problems that are widely studied
and used in the batch model, we show that the worst case error of every
continual release algorithm is $\tilde \Omega(T^{1/3})$ times larger than that
of the best batch algorithm. Previous work shows only a polylogarithimic (in
$T$) gap between the worst case error achievable in these two models; further,
for many problems, including the summation of binary attributes, the
polylogarithmic gap is tight (Dwork et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2010). Our
results show that problems closely related to summation -- specifically, those
that require selecting the largest of a set of sums -- are fundamentally harder
in the continual release model than in the batch model.
  Our lower bounds assume only that privacy holds for streams fixed in advance

hold in a model where privacy is required even for adaptively selected streams.

While SBS has recently been studied extensively in integrated waveguides, many
implementations rely on complicated fabrication schemes, using suspended
waveguides, or non-standard materials such as As$_2$S$_3$. The absence of SBS
in standard and mature fabrication platforms prevents large-scale circuit
integration and severely limits the potential of this technology. Notably, SBS
in standard silicon nitride integration platform is currently rendered out of
reach due to the lack of acoustic guiding and the infinitesimal photo-elastic
response of the material. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate advanced
control of backward SBS in multilayer silicon nitride waveguides. By optimizing
the separation between two silicon nitride layers, we unlock gigahertz acoustic
waveguiding in this platform for the first time, leading up to 15 $\times$
higher SBS gain coefficient than previously possible in silicon nitride
waveguides. Using the same principle, we experimentally demonstrate on-demand
inhibition of SBS by preventing acoustic guiding in the waveguide platform. We
utilize the enhanced SBS gain to demonstrate a microwave photonic notch filter
with high rejection (30 dB). We accomplish this in a low-loss, standard, and
versatile silicon nitride integration platform without the need of suspending
the SBS-active waveguide or hybrid integration with other materials.

stringent assumptions, including normality, linearity, and a compound symmetric
correlation structure, which may be challenging to verify and may not hold in

efficiency of the model-based inference for the average treatment effect are

normal under arbitrary misspecification of its working model. Under equal
randomization, we further show that the model-based variance estimator for the

interval given by standard software is asymptotically valid even under model
misspecification. Beyond robustness, we also provide a caveat that covariate
adjustment via mixed-model ANCOVA may lead to precision loss compared to no
adjustment when the covariance structure is misspecified, and describe when a
cluster-level ANCOVA becomes more efficient. These results hold under both
simple and stratified randomization, and are further illustrated via

found on Earth and other planetary environments. In the great majority of
cases, barchans are organized in large fields in which corridors of
size-selected barchans are observed, and where barchan-barchan interactions
play an important role in size regulation. Previous studies shed light on the
interactions between barchans by making use of monodisperse particles, but
dunes in nature consist, however, of polydisperse grains. In this paper, we
investigate the binary interactions of barchans consisting of (i) bidisperse
mixtures of grains and (ii) different monodisperse grains (one type for each
barchan). We performed experiments in a water channel where grains of different
sizes were poured inside forming two barchans that interacted with each other
while filmed by a camera, and we obtained their morphology from image
processing. We observed that a transient stripe appears over the dunes in cases
of bidisperse mixtures, that interaction patterns vary with concentrations, and
that different interactions exist when each barchan consists of different
monodisperse grains. Interestingly, we found the conditions for a collision in
which the upstream barchan is larger than the downstream one, and we propose a
timescale for the interactions of both monodisperse and bidisperse barchans.
Our results represent a new step toward understanding complex barchanoid
structures found on Earth, Mars and other celestial bodies.

NMR spectra were shifted to lower fields for both magnetic fields $H$ $||$ $c$

at the As site produced by the Mn ordered moments are nearly perpendicular to
the external magnetic field direction. No obvious distribution of $B_{\rm int}$
was observed in SrMn$_2$As$_2$, which clearly indicates a commensurate AFM
state. In sharp contrast to SrMn$_2$As$_2$, broad and complex NMR spectra were
observed in CaMn$_2$As$_2$ in the AFM state, which clearly shows a distribution
of $B_{\rm int}$ at the As site, indicating an incommensurate state. From the

Displaying ads to the right users benefits both the platform (e.g., via

not all users click on displayed ads, while the platform's algorithm may miss
the users most disposed to do so. This mismatch decreases the platform's
revenue and the advertiser's chances to reach the right customers. With this
motivation, we propose a secretary problem where a candidate may or may not
accept an offer according to a known probability $p$. Because we do not know
the top candidate willing to accept an offer, the goal is to maximize a robust
objective defined as the minimum over integers $k$ of the probability of
choosing one of the top $k$ candidates, given that one of these candidates will
accept an offer. Using Markov decision process theory, we derive a linear
program for this max-min objective whose solution encodes an optimal policy.
The derivation may be of independent interest, as it is generalizable and can
be used to obtain linear programs for many online selection models. We further
relax this linear program into an infinite counterpart, which we use to provide
bounds for the objective and closed-form policies. For $p \geq p^* \approx

adopted in deep learning to provide rigorously defined privacy, which requires
gradient clipping to bound the maximum norm of individual gradients and
additive isotropic Gaussian noise. With analysis of the convergence rate of
DP-SGD in a non-convex setting, we reveal that randomly sparsifying gradients
before clipping and noisification adjusts a trade-off between internal
components of the convergence bound and leads to a smaller upper bound when the
noise is dominant. Additionally, our theoretical analysis and extensive
empirical evaluations show that the trade-off is not trivial but possibly a
unique property of DP-SGD, as either canceling noisification or gradient
clipping removes the trade-off in the bound. Based on the analysis, we propose
an efficient and lightweight approach of random sparsification (RS) for DP-SGD.
Applying RS across various DP-SGD frameworks improves performance, while the
produced sparse gradients of RS exhibit advantages in reducing communication
cost and strengthening security against reconstruction attacks, which are also
key problems in private machine learning.

ultranarrow linewidth lasers in a compact form factor. Owing to their small

integrated stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) laser based on a large

thermal-noise-limited linewidth of 270 Hz. In practice, yet narrower linewidths
are required before integrated lasers can be truly useful for applications such

precision spectroscopy. To this end, we employ a thermorefractive noise
suppression technique utilizing an auxiliary laser to reduce our SBS laser
linewidth to 70 Hz. This demonstration showcases the possibility of stabilizing
the thermal motion of even the narrowest linewidth chip lasers to below 100 Hz,

long-standing problem in computer vision. Recent advances in self-supervised

SimCLR, which applies a composition of augmentations to an image, and minimizes
a contrastive loss between the two augmented images. In this paper, we present
CLAWS, an annotation-efficient learning framework, addressing the problem of
manually labeling large-scale agricultural datasets along with potential
applications such as anomaly detection and plant growth analytics. CLAWS uses a
network backbone inspired by SimCLR and weak supervision to investigate the
effect of contrastive learning within class clusters. In addition, we inject a
hard attention mask to the cropped input image before maximizing agreement
between the image pairs using a contrastive loss function. This mask forces the
network to focus on pertinent object features and ignore background features.
We compare results between a supervised SimCLR and CLAWS using an agricultural
dataset with 227,060 samples consisting of 11 different crop classes. Our
experiments and extensive evaluations show that CLAWS achieves a competitive
NMI score of 0.7325. Furthermore, CLAWS engenders the creation of low
dimensional representations of very large datasets with minimal parameter
tuning and forming well-defined clusters, which lends themselves to using

for selecting the nonprobability units and for weighting them. This approach
has been employed in the past to select subsamples of persons from a large
panel of volunteers. One method of weighting, introduced here, is to assign a
unit in the nonprobability sample the weight from its matched case in the
probability sample. The properties of resulting estimators depend on whether
the probability sample weights are inverses of selection probabilities or are
calibrated. In addition, imperfect matching can cause estimates from the
matched sample to be biased so that its weights need to be adjusted, especially
when the size of the volunteer panel is small. Calibration weighting combined
with matching is one approach to correcting bias and reducing variances. We
explore the theoretical properties of the matched and matched, calibrated
estimators with respect to a quasirandomization distribution that is assumed to
describe how units in the nonprobability sample are observed, a superpopulation
model for analysis variables collected in the nonprobability sample, and the
randomization distribution for the probability sample. Numerical studies using
simulated and real data from the 2015 US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance

For startup founders, it is therefore crucial to know whether investors have a

picture of gender bias in early-stage startup funding. We examine European
startups listed on Crunchbase using Semantic Web technologies and analyze how
the share of female founders in a founding team affects the funding amount. We
find that the relative amount of female founders has a negative impact on the
funding raised. Furthermore, we observe that founder characteristics have an
effect on the funding raised based on the founders' gender. Moreover, we find
that gender bias in early-stage funding is less prevalent for serial founders
with entrepreneurial experience as female founders benefit three times more
than male founders from already having founded a startup. Overall, our study
suggests that gender bias exists and is worth to be considered in the context

that charge carriers are described by the Dirac equation in curved-space and
exploiting the fact that wave propagation can be described by ray-optics in
this regime, a general computational strategy is proposed in order to find
strain fields associated with a desired effective refractive index profile. The
latter is first determined by solving semi-classical trajectories and by
optimizing a chosen objective functional using a genetic algorithm. Then, the
graded refractive index corresponding to the strain field is obtained by using
its connection to the metric component in isothermal coordinates. These
coordinates are evaluated via numerical quasiconformal transformations by
solving the Beltrami equation with a finite volume method. The graphene surface
deformation is finally optimized, also using a genetic algorithm, to reproduce
the desired index of refraction. Some analytical results and numerical

m_2})$-approximation algorithm for this problem where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the
number of packing constraints in $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ respectively.
In particular, we show that there exists a near-optimal solution
$(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}, \tilde{\mathbf{y}})$ such that $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ and
$\tilde{\mathbf{y}}$ are ``near-integral"". We give an LP relaxation of the
problem from which we obtain the near-optimal near-integral solution via
randomized rounding. We show that our relaxation is tightly related to the
widely used reformulation linearization technique (RLT). As an application of
our techniques, we present a tight approximation for the two-stage adjustable
robust optimization problem with covering constraints and right-hand side
uncertainty where the separation problem is a bilinear optimization problem. In
particular, based on the ideas above, we give an LP restriction of the
two-stage problem that is an $O(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n} \frac{\log L}{\log
\log L})$-approximation where $L$ is the number of constraints in the
uncertainty set. This significantly improves over state-of-the-art
approximation bounds known for this problem. Furthermore, we show that our LP
restriction gives a feasible affine policy for the two-stage robust problem
with the same (or better) objective value. As a consequence, affine policies
give an $O(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n} \frac{\log L}{\log \log
L})$-approximation of the two-stage problem, significantly generalizing the
previously known bounds on their performance.

to obtain a range of options in terms of size, renewable generation
technologies, and electrical network configuration. The scenarios were studied
in the context of the POSYTYF project and were quantified through an
optimization-based algorithm, using specific locations in Europe, and real data
related to the availability of different RES, as well as the demand. It has
been shown that photovoltaic (PV) and wind generation can provide the renewable

become important to cover the last range of integration, as they provide a high

prominent role in the field, with more and more groups attempting to understand
the uncertainties on their calculations. However, recent studies have shown
that the uncertainties on the optical potentials are too large for the theory
to be useful. Purpose: The purpose of this work is to explore possible
experimental conditions that may reduced the uncertainties on elastic
scattering and single-nucleon transfer cross sections that come from the
fitting of the optical model parameters to experimental data. Method: Using
Bayesian methods, we explore the effect of the uncertainties of optical model
parameters on the angular grid of the differential cross section, including
cross section data at nearby energies, and changes in the experimental error
bars. We also study the effect on the resulting uncertainty when other
observables are included in the fitting procedure, particularly the total
(reaction) cross sections. Results: We study proton and neutron elastic
scattering on 48Ca and 208Pb. We explore the parameter space with Markov- Chain
Monte Carlo, produce posterior distributions for the optical model parameters,
and construct the corresponding 95% confidence intervals on the
elastic-scattering cross sections. We also propagate the uncertainties on the
optical potentials to the 48Ca(d,p)49Ca(g.s.) and 208Pb(d,p)209Pb(g.s.) cross
sections. Conclusions: We find little sensitivity to the angular grid and an
improvement of up to a factor of 2 on the uncertainties by including data at a
nearby energy. Although reducing the error bars on the data does reduce the
uncertainty, the gain is often considerably smaller than one would naively
expect.

systematically eliminate possible causes for this discrepancy, including errors
in the structural model and finite size effects in periodic boundary
conditions. By analysis of the electronic structure in the ground-state and the
core-hole excited-state, we are able to trace the error back to artificial
charge transfer between adsorbed molecule and metal surface. This is caused by
the self-interaction error of common exchange-correlation functionals. This
error is not remedied by standard hybrid or range-separated hybrid functionals.
We employ an ad hoc self-interaction error correction based on molecular
orbital projection, that exposes this issue and is able to recover the correct
experimental behaviour. The charge transfer artefact also negatively affects
the prediction of X-ray absorption spectra for this system. Both the simulated
photoemisson and x-ray absorption spectra show a better agreement with

probabilistically generated based on value function evaluations at two
consecutive states. Capitalizing on a random feature-based approximant of the

estimate the value function for a given policy by observing a sequence of

adversarial setting, where the modeling assumptions are violated, complementary
worst-case analyses are performed by upper-bounding the cumulative Bellman
error as well as the long-term reward prediction error, relative to their
counterparts from a fixed value function estimator with the entire state-reward
trajectory in hindsight. Moreover, to alleviate the limited expressiveness
associated with a single fixed kernel, a weighted ensemble (E) of GP priors is
employed to yield an alternative scheme, termed OS-EGPTD, that can jointly
infer the value function, and select interactively the EGP kernel on-the-fly.
Finally, performances of the novel OS-(E)GPTD schemes are evaluated on two

as borophene or graphene is analyzed in a continuous wave regime for an

transformation, the wave function evolution is shown to be governed by a
spinor-component decoupled Whittaker-Hill equation. The numerical solution of
these equations enables to find the quasienergy spectrum. For borophene it
reveals a strong anisotropic response. By applying an extra unitary
transformation, the wave functions are proven to follow an Ince equation. The
evolution of the real and imaginary parts of the wave function is interpreted
as the trajectory of a classical charged particle under oscillating electric
and magnetic field. The topological properties of this forced quantum system
are studied using this analogy. In particular, in the adiabatic driving regime,
the system is described with an effective Matthieu equation while in the
non-adiabatic regime the full Whittaker-Hill equation is needed. From there, it
is possible to separate the dynamical and Berry phase contributions to obtain
the topological phase diagram due to the driving. Therefore, a different path
to perturbation theory is developed to obtain time-driven topological phases.

human intention inference in this domain using Bayesian inverse planning and
inverse body kinematics. We compare our model to three heuristics, which
formalize the principle of least effort using simple assumptions about the

the receiver and needs accurate channel estimation to guarantee its
performance. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we design a deep

formulate the detection process as a sparse reconstruction problem by utilizing
the inherent attributes of IM. Then, based on greedy strategy, we design a DL

process. Different from the general neural networks, we introduce complex value
operations to adapt the complex signals in communication systems. To the best

verify the adaptability and robustness of the proposed detector, simulations
are carried out with consideration of inaccurate channel state information
(CSI) and correlated MIMO channels. The simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed detector outperforms existing algorithms in terms of antenna
recognition accuracy and bit error rate under various scenarios.

to the $I=2$ $\pi\pi$ system to calculate the corresponding potential in the

considers polarization reconfigurable multiple input multiple output (PR-MIMO)

introduce joint polarization pre-post coding to maximize bounds on the capacity
and the maximum eigenvalue of the channel matrix. For this we first derive
approximate closed form equations of optimal polarization vectors at one link
end, and then use iterative joint polarization pre-post coding to pursue joint
optimal polarization vectors at both link ends. Next we investigate the
combination of PR-MIMO with hybrid antenna selection / maximum ratio
transmission (PR-HS/MRT), which can achieve a remarkable improvement of channel
capacity and symbol error rate (SER). Further, two novel schemes of element
wise and global polarization reconfiguration are presented for PR-HS/MRT.
Comprehensive simulation results indicate that the proposed schemes provide 3
to 5 dB SNR gain in PR-MIMO spatial multiplexing and approximately 3 dB SNR
gain in PRHS/ MRT, with concomitant improvements of channel capacity and SER.

kinetic equations represents a challenge due to the high dimensionality of the
models: often the computational costs involved become prohibitive. On the other

simplified models capable of providing approximate solutions at a
computationally reduced cost has always represented one of the main research
strands in the field of kinetic equations. Approximations based on suitable
closures of the moment equations or on simplified collisional models have been
studied by many authors. In the context of uncertainty quantification, it is
therefore natural to take advantage of such models in a multi-fidelity setting
where the original kinetic equation represents the high-fidelity model, and the
simplified models define the low-fidelity surrogate models. The scope of this
article is to survey some recent results about multi-fidelity methods for
kinetic equations that are able to accelerate the solution of the uncertainty

and volume that gives rise to the van der Waals type phase transition for black
holes. For Einstein's GR, the expressions of these quantities are unanimously
accepted. Of late, the van der Waals phase transition in black holes has been
found in modified theories of gravity as well, such as the $f(R)$ gravity and
the scalar-tensor gravity. However, in the case of these modified theories of
gravity, the expression of pressure (and, hence, volume) is not uniquely
determined. In addition, for these modified theories, the extended phase space
thermodynamics has not been studied extensively, especially in a covariant way.
Since both the scalar-tensor and the $f(R)$ gravity can be discussed in the two
conformally connected frames (the Jordan and the Einstein frame respectively),
the arbitrariness in the expression of pressure, will act upon the equivalence
of the thermodynamic parameters in the two frames. We highlight these issues in
the paper. Before that, in Einstein's gravity (GR), we obtain a general
expression of the equilibrium state version of first law and the Smarr-like
formula from the Einstein's equation for a general static and spherically
symmetric (SSS) metric. Here we directly obtain the first law as well as the
Smarr-like formula in GR in terms of the parameters present in the metric (such
as mass, charge \textit{etc.}). This study also shows how the extended phase
space is formulated (by considering the cosmological constant as variable) and,
also shows why the cosmological constant plays the role of thermodynamic
pressure in GR in extended phase space. Moreover, obtaining the Smarr formula
from the Einstein's equation for the SSS metric suggests that this dynamical
equation encodes more information on BH thermodynamics than what has been
anticipated before.

is generally not obfuscated, which implies it may be extracted simply by
passively observing the victim. We provide such a strategy in the form of a
reward-free exploration algorithm that maximizes the attacker's entropy during
the exploration phase, and then maximizes the victim's empirical entropy during
the planning phase. In our experiments, the victim agents are subverted through
policy entropy maximization, implying an attacker might not need access to the
victim's reward to succeed. Hence, reward-free attacks, which are based only on
observing behavior, show the feasibility of an attacker to act strategically

the cost function or the target image have to be interpolated. While cost-based
interpolation is the easiest to implement, multiple works have shown that image
based interpolation can increase the accuracy of the subpixel matching, but
usually at the cost of expensive search procedures. This, however, is
problematic, especially for very computation intensive applications such as
stereo matching or optical flow computation. In this paper, we show that closed

dimensional matching, e.g., in the case of rectified stereo images where the
search space is of one dimension, exists when using the standard NCC, SSD and

unrectified stereo matching and optical flow extraction. We also compare our
results with traditional cost volume interpolation formulae as well as with
state-of-the-art cost-based refinement methods, and show that the proposed

work, we propose to model semantic and visual information jointly with a
Visual-Semantic Transformer (VST). The VST first explicitly extracts primary
semantic information from visual feature maps with a transformer module and a
primary visual-semantic alignment module. The semantic information is then
joined with the visual feature maps (viewed as a sequence) to form a pseudo
multi-domain sequence combining visual and semantic information, which is
subsequently fed into an transformer-based interaction module to enable
learning of interactions between visual and semantic features. In this way, the
visual features can be enhanced by the semantic information and vice versus.
The enhanced version of visual features are further decoded by a secondary
visual-semantic alignment module which shares weights with the primary one.
Finally, the decoded visual features and the enhanced semantic features are
jointly processed by the third transformer module obtaining the final text
prediction. Experiments on seven public benchmarks including regular/ irregular
text recognition datasets verifies the effectiveness our proposed model,
reaching state of the art on four of the seven benchmarks.

pre-process raw data in the presence of outliers. Maximisation of Consensus

(Tennakoon et al. CVPR2021), a connection has been made between MaxCon and
estimation of influences of a Monotone Boolean function. Equipping the Boolean
cube with different measures and adopting different sampling strategies (two
sides of the same coin) can have differing effects: which leads to the current
study. This paper studies the concept of weighted influences for solving
MaxCon. In particular, we study endowing the Boolean cube with the Bernoulli
measure and performing biased (as opposed to uniform) sampling. Theoretically,
we prove the weighted influences, under this measure, of points belonging to
larger structures are smaller than those of points belonging to smaller
structures in general. We also consider another ""natural"" family of
sampling/weighting strategies, sampling with uniform measure concentrated on a
particular (Hamming) level of the cube.
  Based on weighted sampling, we modify the algorithm of Tennakoon et al., and
test on both synthetic and real datasets. This paper is not promoting a new
approach per se, but rather studying the issue of weighted sampling.
Accordingly, we are not claiming to have produced a superior algorithm: rather
we show some modest gains of Bernoulli sampling, and we illuminate some of the
interactions between structure in data and weighted sampling.

novel training strategy named Temporally Resolution Decrement. Wherein, we
randomly reduce the training images to a smaller resolution in the time domain.
During the alternate training with the reduced images and the original images,
the unstable texture information in the images results in a weaker correlation
between the texture-related patterns and the correct label, naturally enforcing
the model to rely more on shape properties that are robust and conform to the

tasks with graph-structural data, among which node classification is an
essential one. Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) shows its practical
value of reducing the labeling cost for node classification. It leverages
knowledge from a labeled graph (i.e., source domain) to tackle the same task on
another unlabeled graph (i.e., target domain). Most existing UGDA methods
heavily rely on the labeled graph in the source domain. They utilize labels
from the source domain as the supervision signal and are jointly trained on
both the source graph and the target graph. However, in some real-world
scenarios, the source graph is inaccessible because of either unavailability or
privacy issues. Therefore, we propose a novel scenario named Source Free
Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (SFUGDA). In this scenario, the only
information we can leverage from the source domain is the well-trained source
model, without any exposure to the source graph and its labels. As a result,
existing UGDA methods are not feasible anymore. To address the non-trivial
adaptation challenges in this practical scenario, we propose a model-agnostic
algorithm for domain adaptation to fully exploit the discriminative ability of
the source model while preserving the consistency of structural proximity on
the target graph. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm both
theoretically and empirically. The experimental results on four cross-domain
tasks show consistent improvements of the Macro-F1 score up to 0.17.

planets form in a diverse range of conditions across the cosmos. Transiting
circumbinary planets yield especially important insights and many examples are
now known, in broadly coplanar obits with respect to their binary. Studies of
circumbinary disks suggest misaligned transiting examples could also plausibly
exist, but their existence would exacerbate the already challenging feat of
automatic detection. In this work, we synthesize populations of such planets
and consider the number of transits per epoch they produce, forming integer
sequences. For isotropic distributions, such sequences will appear foreign to
conventional expectation, rarely (~1%) producing the signature double-transits
we have come to expect for circumbinaries, instead producing sparse sequences
dominated by zero-transit epochs (~80%). Despite their strangeness, we
demonstrate that these sequences will be non-random and that the two preceding
epochs predict the next to high accuracy. Additionally, we show that even when
clustering the transits into grouped epochs, they often appear unphysical if
erroneously assuming a single star, due to the missing epochs. Crucially,
missing epochs mean highly isotropic populations can trick the observer into
assigning the wrong period in up to a quarter of cases, adding further
confusion. Finally, we show that the transit sequences encode the inclination
distribution and demonstrate a simple inference method that successfully
matches the injected truth. Our work highlights how the simple act of flagging
transits can be used to provide an initial, vetting-level analysis of
misaligned transiting circumbinary planets.

However, such design mainly focuses on object word generation and thus may

Moreover, relational words (e.g., ""jump left or right"") are usual
spatio-temporal inference results, i.e., these words cannot be grounded on
certain spatial regions. To tackle the above limitations, we design a novel
relational graph learning framework for GVD, in which a language-refined scene
graph representation is designed to explore fine-grained visual concepts.
Furthermore, the refined graph can be regarded as relational inductive
knowledge to assist captioning models in selecting the relevant information it

and natural language processing. To date, researchers have produced impressive
state-of-the-art performance in the age of deep learning. Most of these
state-of-the-art, however, requires large volume of annotated image-caption
pairs in order to train their models. When given an image dataset of interests,
practitioner needs to annotate the caption for each image in the training set
and this process needs to happen for each newly collected image dataset. In
this paper, we explore the task of unsupervised image captioning which utilizes
unpaired images and texts to train the model so that the texts can come from
different sources than the images. A main school of research on this topic that
has been shown to be effective is to construct pairs from the images and texts
in the training set according to their overlap of objects. Unlike in the
supervised setting, these constructed pairings are however not guaranteed to
have fully overlapping set of objects. Our work in this paper overcomes this by
harvesting objects corresponding to a given sentence from the training set,
even if they don't belong to the same image. When used as input to a
transformer, such mixture of objects enables larger if not full object
coverage, and when supervised by the corresponding sentence, produced results
that outperform current state of the art unsupervised methods by a significant
margin. Building upon this finding, we further show that (1) additional
information on relationship between objects and attributes of objects also
helps in boosting performance; and (2) our method also extends well to

challenges, in this paper, we propose the idea of narrative cartography with
knowledge graphs (KGs). Firstly, to tackle the data acquisition & integration
challenge, we develop a set of KG-based GeoEnrichment toolboxes to allow users
to search and retrieve relevant data from integrated cross-domain knowledge
graphs for narrative mapping from within a GISystem. With the help of this
tool, the retrieved data from KGs are directly materialized in a GIS format
which is ready for spatial analysis and mapping. Two use cases - Magellan's
expedition and World War II - are presented to show the effectiveness of this
approach. In the meantime, several limitations are identified from this
approach, such as data incompleteness, semantic incompatibility, and the
semantic challenge in geovisualization. For the later two limitations, we
propose a modular ontology for narrative cartography, which formalizes both the
map content (Map Content Module) and the geovisualization process (Cartography
Module). We demonstrate that, by representing both the map content and the
geovisualization process in KGs (an ontology), we can realize both data
reusability and map reproducibility for narrative cartography.

people with different sensitivities to temperature, for instance due to age and
physiological factors. Thus, a smart home with a single optimal policy may fail

perform these experiments with up to 5 simulated human models each based on

intervening on the casual factors. Then, we augment recommendation systems by
detecting potential attacks with a deep learning-based classifier based on the
crafted data. Finally, we study the attack strength and frequency of
adversarial examples and evaluate our model on standard datasets with multiple
crafting methods. Our extensive experiments show that most adversarial attacks
are effective, and both attack strength and attack frequency impact the attack

are not actually in a scene, due to the visual misclassification or
over-reliance on priors that resulting in the semantic inconsistency between
the visual information and the target lexical words. The most common way is to
encourage the captioning model to dynamically link generated object words or
phrases to appropriate regions of the image, i.e., the grounded image
captioning (GIC). However, GIC utilizes an auxiliary task (grounding objects)
that has not solved the key issue of object hallucination, i.e., the semantic
inconsistency. In this paper, we take a novel perspective on the issue above -
exploiting the semantic coherency between the visual and language modalities.
Specifically, we propose the Consensus Rraph Representation Learning framework
(CGRL) for GIC that incorporates a consensus representation into the grounded
captioning pipeline. The consensus is learned by aligning the visual graph
(e.g., scene graph) to the language graph that consider both the nodes and
edges in a graph. With the aligned consensus, the captioning model can capture
both the correct linguistic characteristics and visual relevance, and then
grounding appropriate image regions further. We validate the effectiveness of
our model, with a significant decline in object hallucination (-9% CHAIRi) on
the Flickr30k Entities dataset. Besides, our CGRL also evaluated by several
automatic metrics and human evaluation, the results indicate that the proposed
approach can simultaneously improve the performance of image captioning (+2.9

data-driven manner, and learn meaningful feature and label embeddings which
capture the label correlations and enhance the predictive power. Our method
also adopts the idea of learning and aligning latent spaces for both features

imposes a Gaussian mixture structure on the latent space, to alleviate the
posterior collapse and over-regularization issues. C-GMVAE outperforms existing

services, which contain no sensitive information by nature. Specifically, we
introduce a contextual multi-armed bandit recommendation framework where the
agent has access to recommendations for other services. In our setting, the
user's (potentially sensitive) information belongs to a high-dimensional latent

components that can be derived from the source recommendations, and
idiosyncratic components that are user-specific and cannot be derived from the

Various methods have been developed to eliminate or weaken the influence of

we propose an deep learning framework to separate neural signal and artifacts
in the embedding space and reconstruct the denoised signal, which is called
DeepSeparator. DeepSeparator employs an encoder to extract and amplify the
features in the raw EEG, a module called decomposer to extract the trend,
detect and suppress artifact and a decoder to reconstruct the denoised signal.
Besides, DeepSeparator can extract the artifact, which largely increases the
model interpretability. The proposed method is tested with a semi-synthetic EEG
dataset and a real task-related EEG dataset, suggesting that DeepSeparator
outperforms the conventional models in both EOG and EMG artifact removal.
DeepSeparator can be extended to multi-channel EEG and data of any length. It
may motivate future developments and application of deep learning-based EEG
denoising. The code for DeepSeparator is available at

motivated the mining of biochemical libraries to identify molecular features

cryopreservation. By probing the biochemical space using solvation-associated
molecular topology and partition-distribution measures we developed an analytic
formalism for ice crystal inhibition. By probing the union between a heat-shock

process generated distinct regions of interest for anti-freeze glycoprotein and
proved robust across different classes of proteins. These results confirm that
there is a chemical space within which efficacious Ice Crystal Inhibitor
molecular libraries can be constructed. These spaces contain latent projections
drawn from solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding capacity and molecular
geometry. They also showed that molecular design can be a useful tool in the
development of new-age cryoactive matrices to enable the smooth transition
across culture, preservation and expansion. These chemical spaces provide low
cytotoxicity since such amphipathic molecules occupy a continuum between
solubizing and membrane stabilizing regions as shown by the free energy of
translocation calculations. These biochemical design spaces are fundamentally
the solution to efficient scale-up and deployment of cell therapies.

two types: individual-based (Agent-based), or compartmental models. While
compartmental models can be structured to separate distinct sectors of a
population, they are conceptually distinct from individual-based models in
which population structure emerges from micro-scale interactions. While the
conceptual distinction is straightforward, a fair comparison of the approaches
is difficult to achieve. Here, we carry out such a comparison by building a set
of compartmental metapopulation models from an agent-based representation of a
real population. By adjusting the compartmental model to approximately match
the dynamics of the Agent-based model, we identify two key qualitative
properties of the individual-based dynamics which are lost upon aggregation
into metapopulations. These are (1) the local depletion of susceptibility to
infection, and (2) decoupling of different regional groups due to correlation
between commuting behaviors and contact rates. The first of these effects is a
general consequence of aggregating small, closely connected groups (i.e.,
families) into larger homogeneous metapopulations. The second can be
interpreted as a consequence of aggregating two distinct types of individuals:
school children, who travel short distances but have many potentially
infectious contacts, and adults, who travel further but tend to have fewer
contacts capable of transmitting infection. Our results could be generalised to
other types of correlations between the characteristics of individuals and the
behaviors that distinguish them.

challenging applications. The main task for any robot is to reach the
destination while keeping a safe separation from other robots and obstacles. In
many scenarios, robots need to move within a narrow corridor, through a window
or a doorframe. In order to guide all robots to move in a cluttered
environment, a curve virtual tube with no obstacle inside is carefully designed
in this paper. There is no obstacle inside the tube, namely the area inside the
tube can be seen as a safety zone. Then, a distributed swarm controller is
proposed with three elaborate control terms: a line approaching term, a robot
avoidance term and a tube keeping term. Formal analysis and proofs are made to
show that the curve virtual tube passing problem can be solved in a finite
time. For the convenience in practical use, a modified controller with an
approximate control performance is put forward. Finally, the effectiveness of
the proposed method is validated by numerical simulations and real experiments.
To show the advantages of the proposed method, the comparison between our
method and the control barrier function method is also presented in terms of
calculation speed.

odd-frequency pair amplitude as increasing the system size. The system size

the Majorana fermions at the edge, the number of low-energy modes corresponding
to the Majorana fermions with different localization lengths, and the
fingerprints of the Majorana fermions. Also, we present the spatial dependence

some traditional wisdoms are integrated. Firstly, we introduce a pairwise

rich structural information, which can be leveraged to aid CF for more

deep neural networks often learn to abuse spurious biases in the data instead
of using the actual task-related information. Since such shortcuts are only
effective within the collected dataset, the resulting biased model
underperforms on real-world inputs, or cause unintended social repercussions
such as gender discrimination. To counteract the influence of bias, existing
methods either exploit auxiliary information which is rarely obtainable in
practice, or sift for bias-free samples in the training data, hoping for the
sufficient existence of clean samples. However, such presumptions about the
data are not always guaranteed. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Debiasing
via Generative Bias-transformation~(CDvG) which is capable of operating in more
general environments where existing methods break down due to unmet
presumptions such as insufficient bias-free samples. Motivated by our
observation that not only discriminative models, as previously known, but also
generative models tend to focus on the bias when possible, CDvG uses a
translation model to transform the bias in the sample to another mode of bias
while preserving task-relevant information. Through contrastive learning, we
set transformed biased views against another, learning bias-invariant
representations. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-arts, and
effectively prevents the models from being biased even when bias-free samples

the conventional layers, such as fully connected layers in DNN-HMM and memory

pre-defined broad phonetic classes and the second layer operating at the

natural speech, overlap in distribution across different acoustic classes is
inevitable, which leads to inter-class mis-classification. The ASR accuracy is
expected to improve if the conventional architecture of acoustic model is
modified to make them more suitable to account for such overlaps. MixNet is
developed keeping this in mind. Analysis conducted by means of scatter diagram
verifies that MoE indeed improves the separation between classes that
translates to better ASR accuracy. Experiments are conducted on a large

and degree twelve in real projective space of dimension 15, and it generalizes
the well-known Study quadric model of rigid body kinematics. Despite its high
dimension, co-dimension, and degree it is amenable to concrete calculations via
conformal geometric algebra (CGA) associated to three-dimensional Euclidean
space. Calculations are facilitated by a four quaternion representation which
extends the dual quaternion description of rigid body kinematics. In
particular, we study straight lines on the Study variety. It turns out that
they are related to a class of one-parametric conformal motions introduced by
L. Dorst in 2016. Similar to rigid body kinematics, straight lines (that is,
Dorst's motions) are important for the decomposition of rational conformal
motions into lower degree motions via the factorization of certain polynomials
with coefficients in CGA.

simultaneous near-ground-state cooling for all motional modes with best average

imitate a broadband motional mode spectrum, we can still reach almost the same
cooling limit for all the modes while standard EIT cooling shows limited
cooling range. Our method has a simple experimental configuration, requiring
only appropriate modulation of the probe beam of standard EIT cooling, and can
be applied to various types of ions (e.g., 171Yb+, 40Ca+). This cooling scheme
provides a powerful tool for the initialization of the trapped-ion quantum

the interpretation of data and offers the ability to probe new parameter
spaces. The amplitudes of the trigger threshold are limited by the rate of
triggering on unavoidable thermal noise fluctuations. We present a real-time

a modified version of a multi-head attention layer to simulate the human visual

backbones, and the framework can be used for multiple medical image analysis
tasks when equipped with task-specific heads. Our method is demonstrated to

often have multiple labels, which typically refer to different regions of the

important to determine which regions are relevant for which labels, but the

in this paper we propose to use word embeddings as a form of prior knowledge
about the meaning of the labels. In particular, visual prototypes are obtained
by aggregating the local feature maps of the support images, using an attention
mechanism that relies on the label embeddings. As an important advantage, our
model can infer prototypes for unseen labels without the need for fine-tuning
any model parameters, which demonstrates its strong generalization abilities.
Experiments on COCO and PASCAL VOC furthermore show that our model

Because of strong ego-motion and a limited field of view, many backgrounds or
noisy frames in a first-person video can distract an action recognition model
during its learning process. To encode more discriminative features, the model
needs to have the ability to focus on the most relevant part of the video for
action recognition. Previous works explored to address this problem by applying
temporal attention but failed to consider the global context of the full video,
which is critical for determining the relatively significant parts. In this
work, we propose a simple yet effective Stacked Temporal Attention Module
(STAM) to compute temporal attention based on the global knowledge across clips
for emphasizing the most discriminative features. We achieve this by stacking
multiple self-attention layers. Instead of naive stacking, which is
experimentally proven to be ineffective, we carefully design the input to each
self-attention layer so that both the local and global context of the video is
considered during generating the temporal attention weights. Experiments
demonstrate that our proposed STAM can be built on top of most existing

that jointly train a model with distributed data sets in IoT while avoiding the
need for central data collection. Due to the limited observation range, such
data sets can only reflect local information, which limits the quality of
trained models. In practice, the global information and local observations
would require a joint consideration for learning to make a reasonable policy.
However, in horizontal FL, the central agency only acts as a model aggregator
without utilizing its global observation to further improve the model. This
could significantly degrade the performance in some missions such as traffic
flow prediction in network systems, where the global information may enhance
the accuracy. Meanwhile, the global feature may not be directly transmitted to
agents for data security. How to utilize the global observation residing in the
central agency while protecting its safety thus rises up as an important
problem in FL. In this paper, we develop a vertical-horizontal federated
learning (VHFL) process, where the global feature is shared with the agents in
a procedure similar to that of vertical FL without any extra communication
rounds. By considering the delay and packet loss, we will analyze VHFL
convergence and validate its performance by experiments. It is shown that the
proposed VHFL could enhance the accuracy compared with horizontal FL while
still protecting the security of global data.

unnatural, singular behavior of the effective potential in the region, where
the imaginary part sets in. Our conclusion is that one has to go beyond the

the minimum of the effective action as a function of $A_0$ and chromomagnetic

quark confinement. To investigate this picture in a gauge-invariant manner, we
have proposed a new formulation of Yang-Mills theory, named the decomposition
method, on the lattice. The so-called restricted field obtained from the
gauge-covariant decomposition plays the dominant role in quark confinement. It
has been known by preceding works that the restricted-field dominance is not
observed for the Wilson loop in higher representations if the restricted part
of the Wilson loop is obtained by adopting the Abelian projection or the field
decomposition naively in the same way as done in the fundamental
representation. Recently, through the non-Abelian Stokes theorem (NAST) for the
Wilson loop operator, we have proposed suitable gauge-invariant operators
constructed from the restricted field to reproduce the correct behavior of the
original Wilson loop averages for higher representations. We have demonstrated
the numerical evidence for the restricted-field dominance in the string
tension.
  In this talk, we focus on the magnetic monopole. According to this picture,
magnetic monopoles causing the dual superconductivity are the dominant degrees
of freedom responsible for confinement. With the help of the NAST, we define
the magnetic monopole and the string tension extracted from the
magnetic-monopole part of the Wilson loop in a gauge-invariant manner. We will
further perform lattice simulations to measure the static potential for quarks
in higher representations using the proposed operators and examine the magnetic
monopole dominance in the string tension, which means that the string tension
extracted from the magnetic-monopole part of the Wilson loop reproduces the
proper string tension obtained from the original Wilson loop.

mitigate possible endogeneity, this paper controls for cohort effects while
also attenuating dynamic bias in the estimation from a dynamic perspective and
provides robust estimates based on multi-model regression. The results show
that (1) education can give positive returns on health needs to the mobile
population under the static perspective, and such returns are underestimated
when cohort effects are ignored; (2) there is a significant cumulative effect
of file completion rate under the dynamic perspective, and file completion in
previous years will have a positive effect on the current year. (3)The positive
relationship between education and willingness to make health decisions is also
characterized by heterogeneity by gender, generation, and education level
itself. Among them, education is more likely to promote decision-making
intentions among men and younger groups, and this motivational effect is more
significant among those who received basic education.

Semi-supervised relation extraction (SSRE) has been proven to be a promising
way for this problem through annotating unlabeled samples as additional
training data. Almost all prior researches along this line adopt multiple
models to make the annotations more reliable by taking the intersection set of
predicted results from these models. However, the difference set, which
contains rich information about unlabeled data, has been long neglected by
prior studies.
  In this paper, we propose to learn not only from the consensus but also the
disagreement among different models in SSRE. To this end, we develop a simple
and general multi-teacher distillation (MTD) framework, which can be easily
integrated into any existing SSRE methods. Specifically, we first let the
teachers correspond to the multiple models and select the samples in the
intersection set of the last iteration in SSRE methods to augment labeled data
as usual. We then transfer the class distributions for samples in the
difference set as soft labels to guide the student. We finally perform
prediction using the trained student model. Experimental results on two public
datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly promotes the performance
of the base SSRE methods with pretty low computational cost.

$M_{\pi^{+}}-M_{\pi^{0}} = 4.622~(95)~{\rm MeV}$, that is in good agreement

studies of the physics and chemistry of star-forming regions. Sulfur is an
important species because its low ionization potential may possibly make it an
important charge carrier. The observed sulfur-bearing species in the gas-phase
of dense clouds represent only a minor fraction of the cosmic sulfur abundance,
which has been interpreted as a signature of sulfur depletion into ices at the
surface of dust grains. However, atomic sulfur, which could be the main
gas-phase carrier, cannot be observed directly in cold cores. We present
measurements of the nitrogen sulfide (NS) radical toward four dense cores
performed with the IRAM-30m telescope. Analytical chemical considerations and
chemical models over a wide parameter space show that the NS:N2H+ abundance
ratio provides a direct constraint on the abundance of gas-phase atomic sulfur.
Toward early-type cores, we find that $n(\rm S)/n_{\rm H}$ is close, or even
equal, to the cosmic abundance of sulfur, 14$\times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating
that sulfur is not depleted and is atomic, which is in agreement with chemical
models. More chemically evolved cores show sulfur depletion by factors up to
100 in their densest parts. In L1544, atomic sulfur depletion is shown to
increase with increasing density. Future observations are needed to discover
the solid-phase carrier of sulfur. The initial steps of the collapse of
pre-stellar cores in the high sulfur abundance regime also need to be explored
from their chemical and dynamical perspectives.

anomalous dimensions are computed. At the order considered, the cubic theories
enjoy a one loop non renormalization of the vertex, so that the beta function
depends non trivially only on the anomalous dimension. The trace of the energy
momentum tensor is also investigated and it is shown that these two families of
QFTs are conformally invariant at the fixed point of the RG flow.

network (RNN) are widely used to generate radar echo frames, they suffer from
inductive bias (i.e., translation invariance and locality) and seriality,
respectively. Recently, Transformer-based methods also gain much attention due
to the great potential of Transformer structure, whereas short-term
dependencies and autoregressive characteristic are ignored. In this paper, we
propose a variant of Transformer named patches with 3D-temporal convolutional
Transformer network (PTCT), where original frames are split into multiple
patches to remove the constraint of inductive bias and 3D-temporal convolution
is employed to capture short-term dependencies efficiently. After training, the
inference of PTCT is performed in an autoregressive way to ensure the quality
of generated radar echo frames. To validate our algorithm, we conduct
experiments on two radar echo dataset: Radar Echo Guangzhou and HKO-7. The
experimental results show that PTCT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)

phases without static counterparts, while conventionally the realization may
rely on the manipulation of complex temporal evolution. Here we propose a
systematic and high-precision scheme to realize unconventional Floquet
topological phases by engineering local band structures in particular momentum
subspace called band inversion surfaces (BISs). This scheme is based on a new
bulk-boundary correspondence that for a class of generic $d$-dimensional
periodically driven systems, the local topological structure formed in each BIS
uniquely determines the features of gapless boundary modes. By engineering the
BIS configuration we demonstrate a highly efficient approach to realize,
manipulate, and detect novel Floquet topological phases. In particular, we
predict a two-dimensional (2D) anomalous Floquet valley-Hall phase which
carries trivial global bulk topological invariants but features protected
counter-propagating edge states in each quasienergy gap. The unconventional
nature of this novel 2D phase is further illustrated by the examination of edge
geometry dependence and its robustness to disorder scattering. Anomalous chiral
topological phases with valley protection in higher dimension are also
predicted and studied. Our systematic and highly feasible scheme opens a new
route to realize and engineer unconventional Floquet topological phases for
ultracold atoms and other quantum simulators.

crucially on the hypotheses on the putative location of the seizure onset zone.
This information is derived from non-invasive data either based on visual
analysis or advanced source localization algorithms. While source localization
applied to interictal spikes recorded on scalp is the classical method, it does
not provide unequivocal information regarding the seizure onset zone. Raw ictal
activity contains a mixture of signals originating from several regions of the
brain as well as EMG artifacts, hampering direct input to the source
localization algorithms. We therefore introduce a methodology that disentangles
the various sources contributing to the scalp ictal activity using independent
component analysis and uses equivalent current dipole localization as putative
locus of ictal sources. We validated the results of our analysis pipeline by
performing long-term simultaneous scalp -- intracerebral (SEEG) recordings in
14 patients and analyzing the wavelet coherence between the independent
component encoding the ictal discharge and the SEEG signals in 8 patients
passing the inclusion criteria. Our results show that invasively recorded ictal
onset patterns, including low-voltage fast activity, can be captured by the
independent component analysis of scalp EEG. The visibility of the ictal
activity strongly depends on the depth of the sources. The equivalent current
dipole localization can point to the seizure onset zone (SOZ) with an accuracy
that can be as high as 10mm for superficially located sources, that gradually
decreases for deeper seizure generators, averaging at 47 mm in the 8 analyzed
patients. Independent component analysis is therefore shown to have a promising
SOZ localizing value, indicating whether the seizure onset zone is neocortical,
and its approximate location, or located in mesial structures. That may
contribute to a better crafting of the hypotheses used as basis of the
stereo-EEG implantations.

$\text{MultC}(G,S)=\text{MultC}^\square (G,S)+\mathbb{R}^E$. The latter is the

guard is a point and can see another point $q$ when $\overline{pq}$ does not
cross the edges of $\cal P$.
  This paper studies a variant of the Art Gallery problem in which guards are
restricted to lie on a dense grid inside $\cal P$. In the general problem,
guards can be anywhere inside or on the boundary of $\cal P$. The general
problem is called the \emph{point} guarding problem. It was proved that the
point guarding problem is APX-complete, meaning that we cannot do better than a
constant-factor approximation algorithm unless $P = NP$.
  A huge amount of research is committed to the studies of combinatorial and
algorithmic aspects of this problem, and as of this time, we could not find a
constant factor approximation for simple polygons. The last best-known
approximation factor for point guarding a simple polygon was $\mathcal{O}(\log
(|OPT|))$ introduced by E. Bonnet and T. Miltzow in 2020, where $|OPT|$ is the
size of the optimal solution. Here, we propose an algorithm with a constant
approximation factor for the point guarding problem where the location of
guards is restricted to a grid. The running time of the proposed algorithm
depends on the number of cells of the grid. The approximation factor is
constant regardless of the grid we use, the running time could be
super-polynomial if the grid size becomes exponential.

The objective of this work is to show that communication can be used to
implement cooperative local feedback controllers in the robots to improve
disturbance rejection and reduce structural stress in the object. In particular
we consider the realistic scenario where measurements are sampled and
transmitted over wireless, and the sampling period is comparable with the
system dynamics time constants. We first propose a kinematic model which is
consistent with the overall systems dynamics under high-gain control and then
we provide sufficient conditions for the exponential stability and monotonic
decrease of the configuration error under different norms. Finally, we test the
proposed controllers on the full dynamical systems showing the benefit of local

data by extracting and propagating structure-aware features. Existing GNN
research designs various propagation schemes to guide the aggregation of
neighbor information. Recently the field has advanced from local propagation
schemes that focus on local neighbors towards extended propagation schemes that
can directly deal with extended neighbors consisting of both local and
high-order neighbors. Despite the impressive performance, existing approaches
are still insufficient to build an efficient and learnable extended propagation
scheme that can adaptively adjust the influence of local and high-order
neighbors. This paper proposes an efficient yet effective end-to-end framework,
namely Contrastive Adaptive Propagation Graph Neural Networks (CAPGNN), to
address these issues by combining Personalized PageRank and attention
techniques. CAPGNN models the learnable extended propagation scheme with a
polynomial of a sparse local affinity matrix, where the polynomial relies on
Personalized PageRank to provide superior initial coefficients. In order to
adaptively adjust the influence of both local and high-order neighbors, a
coefficient-attention model is introduced to learn to adjust the coefficients
of the polynomial. In addition, we leverage self-supervised learning techniques
and design a negative-free entropy-aware contrastive loss to explicitly take
advantage of unlabeled data for training. We implement CAPGNN as two different
versions named CAPGCN and CAPGAT, which use static and dynamic sparse local
affinity matrices, respectively. Experiments on graph benchmark datasets
suggest that CAPGNN can consistently outperform or match state-of-the-art
baselines. The source code is publicly available at

layer to the non-magnetic metal at its interface. The polarization of the
pumped spin current $\textbf{J}_s \propto \textbf{m}\times \dot{\textbf{m}}$
depends on the dynamics of the magnetic moment $\textbf{m}$. When the materials
are based on light transition metals, mechanism behind the spin current
transfer is dominated by the exchange interaction between spin of localized
d-electrons and itinerant conduction electrons. In heavier transition metals,
however, the interaction is not limited to the exchange interaction. The spin
of the conduction electron can interact to its nuclear spin by means of
hyperfine interaction, as observed in the shift of NMR frequency. By studying
the spin polarization of conduction electron of the non-magnetic metallic layer
due to a nuclear magnetic moment $\textbf{I}$ of the ferromagnetic layer, we
show that the hyperfine interaction can mediate the spin pumping. The

to understand the evolution of temperature and density structures on the
intermediate-scale ($\lesssim$0.1-1 pc) extended gas of massive clumps. We
performed $\sim$0.1 pc resolution observations (SMA+APEX) of multiple molecular
line tracers (e.g., CH$_{3}$CCH, H$_{2}$CS, CH$_{3}$CN, CH$_{3}$OH) which cover
a wide range of excitation conditions, towards a sample of eight massive
clumps. Based on various radiative transfer models, we constrain the gas
temperature and density structures and establish an evolutionary picture, aided
by a spatially-dependent virial analysis and abundance ratios of multiple
species. We determine temperature radial profiles varying between 30-200 K over
a continuous scale, from the center of the clumps out to 0.3-0.4 pc radii. The
clumps' radial gas density profiles, described by radial power-laws with slopes
between -0.6 and $\sim$-1.5, are steeper for more evolved sources, as suggested
by results based on both dust continuum, representing the bulk of the gas
($\sim$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$), and CH$_{3}$OH lines probing the dense gas
($\gtrsim$10$^{6}$-10$^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$) regime. The density contrast between the
dense gas and the bulk gas increases with evolution, and may be indicative of
spatially and temporally varying star formation efficiencies. The radial
profiles of the virial parameter show a global variation towards a sub-virial
state as the clump evolves. The line-widths decline with increasing radius
around the central core region and increase in the outer envelope, with a slope
shallower than the case of the supersonic turbulence ($\,\propto\,$$r^{0.5}$)
and the subsonic Kolmogorov scaling ($\,\propto\,$$r^{0.33}$). In the context
of clump evolution, we also find that the abundance ratios of
[CCH]/[CH$_{3}$OH] and [CH$_{3}$CN]/[CH$_{3}$OH] show correlations with clump
$L/M$.

introduced in 2015. The final stage is presented, a
next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) analysis of the HERA data on inclusive
deep inelastic $ep$ scattering together with jet data as published by the H1
and ZEUS collaborations. A perturbative QCD fit, simultaneously of
$\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$ and and the PDFs, was performed with the result
$\alpha_s(M_Z^2) = 0.1156 \pm 0.0011~{\rm (exp)}~ ^{+0.0001}_{-0.0002}~ {\rm
(model}$ ${\rm +~parameterisation)}~ \pm 0.0029~{\rm (scale)}$. The PDF sets of
HERAPDF2.0Jets NNLO were determined with separate fits using two fixed values
of $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$, $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.1155$ and $0.118$, since the latter
value was already chosen for the published HERAPDF2.0 NNLO analysis based on
HERA inclusive DIS data only. The different sets of PDFs are presented,
evaluated and compared. The consistency of the PDFs determined with and without
the jet data demonstrates the consistency of HERA inclusive and jet-production
cross-section data. The inclusion of the jet data reduced the uncertainty on
the gluon PDF. Predictions based on the PDFs of HERAPDF2.0Jets NNLO give an
excellent description of the jet-production data used as input.

seminal deep learning networks champion increased accuracy above all else. In
this paper, we attempt to alleviate biases encountered by semantic segmentation
models in urban driving scenes, via an iteratively trained unlearning
algorithm. Convolutional neural networks have been shown to rely on colour and
texture rather than geometry. This raises issues when safety-critical
applications, such as self-driving cars, encounter images with covariate shift
at test time - induced by variations such as lighting changes or seasonality.
Conceptual proof of bias unlearning has been shown on simple datasets such as
MNIST. However, the strategy has never been applied to the safety-critical
domain of pixel-wise semantic segmentation of highly variable training data -
such as urban scenes. Trained models for both the baseline and bias unlearning
scheme have been tested for performance on colour-manipulated validation sets
showing a disparity of up to 85.50% in mIoU from the original RGB images -
confirming segmentation networks strongly depend on the colour information in
the training data to make their classification. The bias unlearning scheme
shows improvements of handling this covariate shift of up to 61% in the best
observed case - and performs consistently better at classifying the ""human"" and
""vehicle"" classes compared to the baseline model.

dynamics of an electron that can be trapped to a localized state and detrapped
to an extended band state of a small quantum dot (QD) using a simple model
system. In spite of its simplicity the time dependent model has no analytical
solution but a numerically exact one can be found producing a rich dynamics.
The electronic motion is quasi-periodic in time, with oscillations around a
mean value that are basic characteristics of the weak and strong coupling
regimes of electron-phonon interaction and set the time scales of the system.
Using values of the parameters appropriate for defects in semiconductor QDs, we
find these time scales to range typically from tenths of picoseconds to a few
picoseconds. The values of the time averaged trap occupancy strongly depend on
the the strength of the electron-phonon interaction and can be as large as
40$\%$ when the coupling is most efficient, independently of other parameters.
An interesting result of the present work is the formation of resonances at
specific values of the electron-phonon coupling parameter that only exist when
several levels are allowed to coherently cooperate in the filling of the trap.
They are characterized by a trap occupancy that is a periodic function of time
with large amplitude and period picturing an electron that is periodically
trapped and detrapped. We conclude that the formation of these resonances is a
robust consequence of electron-phonon interaction in small systems.
Electron-phonon interaction is an efficient mechanism that can provide ca.
50$\%$ filling of a deep trap state on a subpicoseconds to picoseconds time
scale, much faster than radiative decay occurring in time scales of tens of
picoseconds to nanoseconds, while the occupancy of this state will be smaller
than ca. 1$\%$ in the absence of electron-phonon coupling.

constraining the stellar XUV flux and He abundance at ~10 erg cm2/s (at 1 a.u.)

components in the OCT catheter tip causes rotational distortion in OCT
volumetric scanning. By improving the scanning process, this instability can be
partially reduced. To further correct the rotational distortion in the OCT
image, a volumetric data stabilization algorithm is proposed. The algorithm
first estimates the Non-Uniform Rotational Distortion (NURD) for each B-scan by
using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A correlation map between two
successive B-scans is computed and provided as input to the CNN. To solve the
problem of accumulative error in iterative frame stream processing, we deploy
an overall rotation estimation between reference orientation and actual OCT
image orientation. We train the network with synthetic OCT videos by
intentionally adding rotational distortion into real OCT images. As part of
this article we discuss the proposed method in two different scanning modes:
the first is a conventional pullback mode where the optical components move
along the protection sheath, and the second is a self-designed scanning mode
where the catheter is globally translated by using an external actuator. The
efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are evaluated with synthetic

practical use, as it will identify unknown objects as known by mistake.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose an open-set 3D object detector, which aims
to (1) identify known objects, like the closed-set detection, and (2) identify
unknown objects and give their accurate bounding boxes. Specifically, we divide
the open-set 3D object detection problem into two steps: (1) finding out the
regions containing the unknown objects with high probability and (2) enclosing
the points of these regions with proper bounding boxes. The first step is
solved by the finding that unknown objects are often classified as known
objects with low confidence, and we show that the Euclidean distance sum based
on metric learning is a better confidence score than the naive softmax
probability to differentiate unknown objects from known objects. On this basis,
unsupervised clustering is used to refine the bounding boxes of unknown
objects. The proposed method combining metric learning and unsupervised
clustering is called the MLUC network. Our experiments show that our MLUC

outer wall, in black-blood magnetic resonance (MR) images. Commonly used
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semantic segmentation are suboptimal
for this task as their use does not guarantee a contiguous ring-shaped
segmentation. Instead, in this work, we cast vessel wall segmentation as a
multi-task regression problem in a polar coordinate system. For each carotid
artery in each axial image slice, we aim to simultaneously find two
non-intersecting nested contours that together delineate the vessel wall. CNNs
applied to this problem enable an inductive bias that guarantees ring-shaped
vessel walls. Moreover, we identify a problem-specific training data
augmentation technique that substantially affects segmentation performance. We
apply our method to segmentation of the internal and external carotid artery
wall, and achieve top-ranking quantitative results in a public challenge, i.e.,
a median Dice similarity coefficient of 0.813 for the vessel wall and median
Hausdorff distances of 0.552 mm and 0.776 mm for lumen and outer wall,
respectively. Moreover, we show how the method improves over a conventional
semantic segmentation approach. These results show that it is feasible to
automatically obtain anatomically plausible segmentations of the carotid vessel
wall with high accuracy.

some fraction of CN counterparts detected in X-rays. This hypothesis will be
further tested in the course of the following SRG/eROSITA sky surveys. The CN
counterparts represent a bona fide sample of accreting WDs with unstable
hydrogen burning on their surface, while their X-ray luminosity in quiescence
is a reasonable proxy for the accretion rate in the binary system. Using this
fact, we have constructed the accretion rate distribution of WDs with unstable
hydrogen burning and compared it with the accretion rate distribution of known
steady supersoft X-ray sources in our Galaxy and nearby external galaxies.
There is a pronounced dichotomy between these two distributions with the CN
counterparts and the steady supersoft sources occupying different domains along
the mass accretion rate axis, in accordance with the predictions of the theory
of hydrogen burning on the WD surface.

attention, especially in the medical imaging realm. To develop a secure medical
image analysis (MIA) system, it is a must to study possible backdoor attacks
(BAs), which can embed hidden malicious behaviors into the system. However,
designing a unified BA method that can be applied to various MIA systems is
challenging due to the diversity of imaging modalities (e.g., X-Ray, CT, and
MRI) and analysis tasks (e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation).
Most existing BA methods are designed to attack natural image classification
models, which apply spatial triggers to training images and inevitably corrupt
the semantics of poisoned pixels, leading to the failures of attacking dense
prediction models. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Frequency-Injection based Backdoor Attack method (FIBA) that is capable of
delivering attacks in various MIA tasks. Specifically, FIBA leverages a trigger
function in the frequency domain that can inject the low-frequency information
of a trigger image into the poisoned image by linearly combining the spectral
amplitude of both images. Since it preserves the semantics of the poisoned
image pixels, FIBA can perform attacks on both classification and dense
prediction models. Experiments on three benchmarks in MIA (i.e., ISIC-2019 for
skin lesion classification, KiTS-19 for kidney tumor segmentation, and EAD-2019
for endoscopic artifact detection), validate the effectiveness of FIBA and its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in attacking MIA models as well as
bypassing backdoor defense. Source code will be available at

recommender systems. However, it does not actually reflect the actual
satisfaction of users. For example, in E-commerce, a large portion of clicks do
not translate to purchases, and many purchases end up with negative reviews. As
such, it is of importance to account for the inevitable noises in implicit
feedback. However, little work on recommendation has taken the noisy nature of
implicit feedback into consideration. In this work, we explore the central
theme of denoising implicit feedback for recommender learning, including
training and inference. By observing the process of normal recommender
training, we find that noisy feedback typically has large loss values in the
early stages. Inspired by this observation, we propose a new training strategy
named Adaptive Denoising Training (ADT), which adaptively prunes the noisy
interactions by two paradigms (i.e., Truncated Loss and Reweighted Loss).
Furthermore, we consider extra feedback (e.g., rating) as auxiliary signal and
propose three strategies to incorporate extra feedback into ADT: finetuning,
warm-up training, and colliding inference. We instantiate the two paradigms on
the widely used binary cross-entropy loss and test them on three representative
recommender models. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that
ADT significantly improves the quality of recommendation over normal training
without using extra feedback. Besides, the proposed three strategies for using
extra feedback largely enhance the denoising ability of ADT.

frames in a video sequence, is an important research topic in computer vision.
Existing video frame interpolation methods have achieved remarkable results
under specific assumptions, such as instant or known exposure time. However, in
complicated real-world situations, the temporal priors of videos, i.e. frames
per second (FPS) and frame exposure time, may vary from different camera
sensors. When test videos are taken under different exposure settings from
training ones, the interpolated frames will suffer significant misalignment
problems. In this work, we solve the video frame interpolation problem in a
general situation, where input frames can be acquired under uncertain exposure
(and interval) time. Unlike previous methods that can only be applied to a
specific temporal prior, we derive a general curvilinear motion trajectory
formula from four consecutive sharp frames or two consecutive blurry frames
without temporal priors. Moreover, utilizing constraints within adjacent motion
trajectories, we devise a novel optical flow refinement strategy for better
interpolation results. Finally, experiments demonstrate that one well-trained

solving graph analytics tasks. It can effectively convert discrete graph data
into a low-dimensional space where the graph structural information and graph
properties are maximumly preserved. While there is rich literature on node and
whole-graph representation learning, GRL for link is relatively less studied
and less understood. One common practice in previous works is to generate link
representations by directly aggregating the representations of their incident
nodes, which is not capable of capturing effective link features. Moreover,
common GRL methods usually rely on full-graph training, suffering from poor
scalability and high resource consumption on large-scale graphs. In this paper,
we design Subgraph Contrastive Link Representation Learning (SCLRL) -- a

between central links and their neighborhood subgraphs to characterize links.
We extract the ""link-centric induced subgraphs"" as input, with a subgraph-level
contrastive discrimination as pretext task, to learn the intrinsic and
structural link features via subgraph mini-batch training. Extensive
experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate that SCLRL has significant
performance advantages in link representation learning on benchmark datasets

epidemic models mainly fall in two approaches: compartmental models, divide the

of differential equations to give a macroscopic view of the epidemical
dynamics, allowing to evaluate its spread a posteriori; agent-based models are
computer models that give a microscopic view of the situation, since each human
is modelled as one autonomous agent, allowing to study the epidemical dynamics
in relation to (heterogeneous) individual behaviours. In this work, we compared
both methodologies and combined them to try and take advantage of the benefits
of each, and to overcome their limits. In particular, agent-based simulation
can be used to refine the values of the parameters of a compartmental model, or
to predict how these values evolve depending on sanitary policies applied. In

within the Cowling approximation, we derive the general equations, governing
the dynamics of discrete relativistic $r$-modes for both barotropic
(isentropic) and nonbarotropic stars. A detailed analysis of the obtained
equations in the limit of extremely slow stellar rotation rate reveals that,
because of the effect of inertial reference frame-dragging, the relativistic
$r$-mode eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies become {\it non-analytic}
functions of the stellar angular velocity, $\Omega$. We also derive the
explicit expressions for the $r$-mode eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies for
very small values of $\Omega$. These expressions explain the asymptotic
behavior of the numerically calculated eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions in
the limit $\Omega\to 0$. All the obtained $r$-mode eigenfrequencies take
discrete values in the frequency range, usually associated with the continuous
part of the spectrum. No indications of the continuous spectrum, at least in
the vicinity of the Newtonian $l=m=2$ $r$-mode frequency $\sigma=-4/3 \

pre-text tasks to capture different levels of similarities in graphs. The
feature extraction process is encouraged to capture more complex proximity by
jointly optimizing the pre-text task and the target task. Consequently, the
local feature aggregations are improved from the structure side. Second,
self-distillation uses soft labels of the model itself as additional
supervision, which has similar effects as label smoothing. The knowledge from
the classification pipeline and the self-supervision pipeline is collectively
distilled to improve the generalization ability of the model from the label
side. Experiment results show that the proposed method obtains remarkable

identifies different spectral types in order to describe a consistent picture
of QSOs. In this work we present a spectroscopic analysis focused on the
comparison between two sources, one radio-loud (PKS2000-330, z = 3.7899) and
one radio-quiet (Q1410+096, z = 3.3240), both showing Population A quasar
spectral properties. Optical spectra were observed in the infrared with
VLT/ESO, and the additional measures in UV were obtained through the fitting of
archive spectra. The analysis was performed through a non-linear
multi-component decomposition of the emission line profiles. Results are shown
in order to highlight the effects of the radio-loudness on their emission line
properties. The two quasars share similar optical spectroscopic properties and
are very close on the MS classification while presenting significant
differences on the UV data. Both sources show significant blueshifts in the UV
lines but important differences in their UV general behaviour. While the
radio-quiet source Q1410+096 shows a typical Pop A UV spectrum with similar

their technical potential, defined as the maximum energy that can be exchanged

a seasonal regeneration of the ground. This paper proposes a new approach to
quantify the technical potential of GSHPs, accounting for effects of seasonal

climate change and market penetration levels of cooling systems. The case study
in western Switzerland suggests that seasonal regeneration allows for annual
maximum heat extraction densities above 300 kWh/m$^2$ at heat injection
densities above 330 kWh/m$^2$. Results also show that GSHPs may cover up to 55%

resources (DERs) for the transmission-level operation. A challenge in operating
a VPP is to characterize the cost function over its feasible power transfer
region under DERs' uncertainties. To address this challenge, a characterization
method is presented in this paper for the intraday operation of a VPP based on
the concepts of nonanticipativity and robustness to DERs' uncertainties. The
characterization stems from designing a second-order cone programming (SOCP)
problem, based on which a feasible power transfer region across all time
periods is constructed by exploring boundary points at each time period and
establishing time coupling constraints. Furthermore, a cost function over the
feasible power transfer region is formulated as a convex piecewise surface
whose breakpoints are obtained by solving SOCP problems, together with a
constant compensation cost from a linear programming problem. Finally, to
alleviate the heavy computational burden brought by numerous DERs, an
approximation method is presented by identifying the critical DERs whose
uncertainties have dominant impacts. The effectiveness of the presented methods
is verified by the numerical experiments in a 3-bus system and the IEEE 136-bus

switches at predefined rates between two interaction states with different

dynamics of inhomogeneous liquids to study the influence of the switching
activity on the self and distinct part of the Van Hove function in bulk
solution, and determine the corresponding mean squared displacement of the
switching particles. Our results demonstrate that, even though the average
diffusion coefficient is not affected by the switching activity, it
significantly modifies the non-equilibrium dynamics and diffusion coefficients
of the individual particles, leading to a crossover from short to long times,
with a regime for intermediate times showing anomalous diffusion. In addition,
the self-part of the van Hove function has a Gaussian form at short and long
times, but becomes non-Gaussian at intermediates ones, having a crossover
between short and large displacements. The corresponding self-intermediate
scattering function shows the two-step relaxation patters typically observed in
soft materials with heterogeneous dynamics such as glasses and gels. We also
introduce a phenomenological Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) theory to
understand the heterogeneous diffusion of this system. R-DDFT results are in
excellent agreement with R-BD simulations and the analytical predictions of
CTRW theory, thus confirming that R-DDFT constitutes a powerful method to
investigate not only the structure and phase behavior, but also the dynamical

precise QCD predictions. By using the well measured effective coupling
$\alpha^{g_1}_{s}(Q)$ defined from the Bjorken sum rules as a basis, we suggest
a novel and self-consistency way to fix the $\alpha_s$ at all scales: The QCD
light-front holographic model is adopted for its infrared behavior, and the
fixed-order pQCD prediction under the principle of maximum conformality (PMC)
is used for its high-energy behavior. Using the PMC scheme-and-scale
independent perturbative series, and by transforming it into the one under the
physical $V$-scheme, we observe that a precise $\alpha_s$ running behavior in
both the perturbative and nonperturbative domains with a smooth transition from
small to large scales can be achieved.

visible decay searches at fixed-target experiments have been exploring dark
sector. Composite asymmetric dark matter with dark photon portal is a promising
framework explaining the coincidence problem between dark matter and visible
matter. Dark strong dynamics provides rich structure in the dark sector: the
lightest dark nucleon is the dark matter, while strong annihilation into dark
pions depletes the symmetric components of the dark matter. Dark photons
alleviate cosmological problems. Meanwhile, dark photons make dark hadrons
long-lived in terrestrial experiments. Moreover, the dark hadrons are produced
through the very same dark photon. In this study, we discuss the visible decay
searches for composite asymmetric dark matter models. For a few GeV dark
nucleons, the LHC lifetime frontier, MATHUSLA and FASER, has a potential to
discover their decay when kinetic mixing angle of dark photon is $\epsilon
\gtrsim 10^{-4}$. On the other hand, fixed-target experiments, in particular
SeaQuest, will have a great sensitivity to dark pions with a mass below GeV and
with kinetic mixing $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-4}$ in addition to the LHC lifetime
frontier. These projected sensitivities to dark hadrons in dark photon
parameter space are comparable with the future sensitivities of dark photon
searches, such as Belle-II and LHCb.

balance the tradeoff between speed and accuracy of citation recommendation in

prefetch a limited number of relevant documents using efficient ranking methods
and then to perform a fine-grained reranking using more sophisticated models.
In that vein, BM25 has been found to be a tough-to-beat approach to
prefetching, which is why recent work has focused mainly on the reranking step.
Even so, we explore prefetching with nearest neighbor search among text
embeddings constructed by a hierarchical attention network. When coupled with a
SciBERT reranker fine-tuned on local citation recommendation tasks, our
hierarchical Attention encoder (HAtten) achieves high prefetch recall for a
given number of candidates to be reranked. Consequently, our reranker requires
fewer prefetch candidates to rerank, yet still achieves state-of-the-art

performance of different set-ups, the ground-state energy of hydrogen molecule
has been chosen as a benchmark for which the exact solution exists in
literature. Applying variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to a qubit
Hamiltonian obtained by the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation we have analyzed the
impact of various computational technicalities. These include (i) the choice of
optimization methods, (ii) the architecture of quantum circuits, as well as
(iii) different types of noise when simulating real quantum processors. On
these we eventually performed a series of experimental runs as a complement to
our simulations. The SPSA and COBYLA optimization methods have clearly
outperformed the Nelder-Mead and Powell methods. The results obtained when
using the $R_{\mathrm{y}}$ variational form were better than those obtained
when the $R_{\mathrm{y}}R_{\mathrm{z}}$ form was used. The choice of an optimum
{entangling layer} was sensitively interlinked with the choice of the
optimization method. The circular {entangling layer} has been found to worsen
the performance of the COBYLA method while the full {entangling layer} improved
it. All four optimization methods sometimes lead to an energy that corresponds
to an excited state rather than the ground state. We also show that a
similarity analysis of measured probabilities can provide a useful insight.

continuously understand the current actions of others and quickly adapt their

coordination processes at the level of mental states (intentions, goals), which
we call belief resonance, can lead to collaborative situated problem-solving.
We present a model of hierarchical active inference for collaborative agents
(HAICA). It combines efficient Bayesian Theory of Mind processes with a
perception-action system based on predictive processing and active inference.
Belief resonance is realized by letting the inferred mental states of one agent
influence another agent's predictive beliefs about its own goals and
intentions. This way, the inferred mental states influence the agent's own task
behavior without explicit collaborative reasoning. We implement and evaluate
this model in the Overcooked domain, in which two agents with varying degrees
of belief resonance team up to fulfill meal orders. Our results demonstrate
that agents based on HAICA achieve a team performance comparable to recent
state of the art approaches, while incurring much lower computational costs. We
also show that belief resonance is especially beneficial in settings were the
agents have asymmetric knowledge about the environment. The results indicate
that belief resonance and active inference allow for quick and efficient agent
coordination, and thus can serve as a building block for collaborative
cognitive agents.

able to reproduce the stable and non-expanding disk structures at the
simulation end times of $\sim10^9$ years, with no halo inclusion. Although the

placement and content of logging statements remain as challenges. To overcome
these challenges, methods that aim to automate log placement and predict its
content, i.e., 'where and what to log', are of high interest. Thus, we focus on
predicting the location (i.e., where) and description (i.e., what) for log
statements by utilizing source code clones and natural language processing
(NLP), as these approaches provide additional context and advantage for log
prediction. Specifically, we guide our research with three research questions
(RQs): (RQ1) how similar code snippets, i.e., code clones, can be leveraged for
log statements prediction? (RQ2) how the approach can be extended to automate
log statements' descriptions? and (RQ3) how effective the proposed methods are
for log location and description prediction? To pursue our RQs, we perform an
experimental study on seven open-source Java projects. We introduce an updated
and improved log-aware code-clone detection method to predict the location of
logging statements (RQ1). Then, we incorporate natural language processing
(NLP) and deep learning methods to automate the log statements' description
prediction (RQ2). Our analysis shows that our hybrid NLP and code-clone

finding log statement locations on average by 15.60% and achieves 40.86% higher
performance on BLEU and ROUGE scores for predicting the description of logging

survival of low-mass subhalos requires stringent limits on the photon-mediated
soft scattering. The current stringent direct detection limits indicate for a
small dipole moment, which lets DM decouple early and allows small subhalos to
form. We calculate the DM kinetic decoupling temperature in the Early Universe
and evaluate the smallest protohalo mass. In the late Universe, low-mass
subhalos can be evaporated via soft collision by ionizied gas and accelerated
cosmic rays. We calculate the subhalo evaporation rate and show that subhalos
lighter than $10^{-5}M_{\odot}$ in the gaseous inner galactic region are
subject to evaporation via dark matter's effective electric and magnetic dipole
moments below current direct detection limits, which potentially affects the
low-mass subhalo distribution in the galactic center.

cost, while unsupervised approaches often have unsatisfactory accuracy.
Besides, the spatial and temporal information is often ignored or not well
exploited by those methods. This motivates us to propose a robust
weakly-supervised method, called ViF-SD2E, for neural decoding. In particular,
it consists of a space-division (SD) module and a exploration--exploitation
(2E) strategy, to effectively exploit both the spatial information of the
outside world and the temporal information of neural activity, where the SD2E
output is analogized with the weak 0/1 vision-feedback (ViF) label for
training. It is worth noting that the designed ViF-SD2E is based on a symmetric
phenomenon between the unsupervised decoding trajectory and the real trajectory

simulations on GPU of GCs with and without a DM mini-halo, orbiting a
Fornax-like dwarf galaxy. For GCs with DM, we observe that this dark extra mass
triggers a tidal radius growth that allows the mini-halo to act as a protective
shield against tidal stripping, being itself stripped beforehand the stars. We
demonstrate that this shielding effect becomes negligible when the tidal radius
is smaller than the half-mass radius of the mini-halo. Contrary to previous
predictions, we found that the inflation of outer stellar velocity dispersion
profiles is expected for GCs with and without a mini-halo, as a result of the
host's tidal field. Moreover, we observe that GCs with a DM mini-halo should
have, in general, relatively more radial outer velocity anisotropy profiles
throughout all their orbits, smaller degrees of internal rotation, and as a
consequence of the latter, smaller ellipticities for their stellar
distribution. Due to dynamical friction, we observe a clear bimodal
evolutionary distribution of GCs with and without DM in the integrals of motion

address this gap by conducting a comparative algorithm audit to examine the

conspiracy theory-related queries (flat earth, new world order, qanon, 9/11,

returned links to conspiracy-dedicated websites in their top results, although
the share of such content varied across queries. Most conspiracy-promoting
results came from social media and conspiracy-dedicated websites while
conspiracy-debunking information was shared by scientific websites and, to a
lesser extent, legacy media. The fact that these observations are consistent
across different locations and time periods highlight the possibility of some
search engines systematically prioritizing conspiracy-promoting content and,
thus, amplifying their distribution in the online environments.

a severe problem for high resolution imaging instruments, if an atmospheric

chromatic elongation caused by the atmosphere and thus make it easier to

measurements consistent with atmospheric dispersion models to within 0.5
arcsec. Direct measurements of the elongation do not prove suitable for the
characterisation of atmospheric dispersion. We conclude that the addition of
this type of diffraction mask can be valuable for measurements of PSF
elongation. This can enable high precision correction of atmospheric dispersion

half-space oscillates in time, which results in a decaying solubility wave
propagating deep into the porous medium. In such a system, the zones of

idea that a magnet near equilibrium can be described by two magnetic variables.
One is the usual magnetization $\vec{M}$. The other is the non-equilibrium
quantity $\vec{m}$, called the spin accumulation, by which the non-equilibrium
spin current can be transported. $\vec{M}$ represents a correlated distribution
of a very large number of degrees of freedom, as expressed in some equilibrium
distribution function for the excitations; we therefore forbid $\vec{M}$ to
diffuse, but we permit $\vec{M}$ to decay. On the other hand, we permit
$\vec{m}$, due to spin excitations, to both diffuse and decay. For this
physical picture, diffusion from a given region occurs by decay of $\vec{M}$ to
$\vec{m}$, then by diffusion of $\vec{m}$, and finally by decay of $\vec{m}$ to
$\vec{M}$ in another region. This somewhat slows down the diffusion process.
Restricting ourselves to the longitudinal variables $M$ and $m$ with
equilibrium properties $M_{eq}=M_{0}+\chi_{M\parallel}H$ and $m_{eq}=0$, we
argue that the effective energy density must include a new, thermodynamically
required exchange constant $\lambda_{M}=-1/\chi_{M\parallel}$. We then develop
the macroscopic equations by applying Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics,
and use the resulting equations to study the space and time response. At fixed
real frequency $\omega$ there is, as usual, a single pair of complex
wavevectors $\pm k$ but with an unusual dependence on $\omega$. At fixed real
wavevector, there are two decay constants, as opposed to one in the usual case.
Extending the idea that non-equilibrium diffusion in other ordered systems
involves a non-equilibrium quantity, this work suggests that in a
superconductor the order parameter $\Delta$ can decay but not diffuse, but a
non-equilibrium gap-like $\delta$, due to pair excitations, can both decay and
diffuse.

Inference. Empirically, well-chosen regularization schemes often dramatically
improve the quality of the inferred models by avoiding overfitting of the
training data. We consider here the particular case of L 2 and L 1
regularizations in the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of generative
pairwise graphical models. Based on analytical calculations on Gaussian
multivariate distributions and numerical experiments on Gaussian and Potts
models we study the likelihoods of the training, test, and 'generated data'
(with the inferred models) sets as functions of the regularization strengths.
We show in particular that, at its maximum, the test likelihood and the
'generated' likelihood, which quantifies the quality of the generated samples,
have remarkably close values. The optimal value for the regularization strength
is found to be approximately equal to the inverse sum of the squared couplings
incoming on sites on the underlying network of interactions. Our results seem
largely independent of the structure of the true underlying interactions that
generated the data, of the regularization scheme considered, and are valid when
small fluctuations of the posterior distribution around the MAP estimator are
taken into account. Connections with empirical works on protein models learned

quark, a gluon and an up or charm quark. Two production processes are
considered: $u+g\rightarrow t$ and $c+g\rightarrow t$. The analysis is based on
proton-proton collision data taken at a centre-of-mass energy of 13$\,$TeV with
the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The data set corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. Events with exactly one electron or muon, exactly
one $b$-tagged jet and missing transverse momentum are selected, resembling the
decay products of a singly produced top quark. Neural networks based on
kinematic variables differentiate between events from the two signal processes
and events from background processes. The measured data are consistent with the
background-only hypothesis, and limits are set on the production cross-sections
of the signal processes: $\sigma(u+g\rightarrow
t)\times\mathcal{B}(t\rightarrow Wb)\times\mathcal{B}(W\rightarrow
\ell\nu)<3.0\,$pb and $\sigma(c+g\rightarrow t)\times\mathcal{B}(t\rightarrow
Wb)\times\mathcal{B}(W\rightarrow \ell\nu)<4.7\,$pb at the 95% confidence
level, with $\mathcal{B}(W\rightarrow \ell\nu)=0.325$ being the sum of
branching ratios of all three leptonic decay modes of the $W$ boson. Based on
the framework of an effective field theory, the cross-section limits are
translated into limits on the strengths of the $tug$ and $tcg$ couplings
occurring in the theory: $|C^{\,ut}_{uG}|/\Lambda^2 < 0.057\,$TeV$^{-2}$ and
$|C^{\,ct}_{uG}|/\Lambda^2 < 0.14\,$TeV$^{-2}$. These bounds correspond to
limits on the branching ratios of FCNC-induced top-quark decays:
$\mathcal{B}(t\rightarrow u+g)< 0.61\times 10^{-4}$ and
$\mathcal{B}(t\rightarrow c+g)< 3.7\times 10^{-4}$.

characterized by a change of the spin Chern numbers and their corresponding

investigated on a sample close to the transition line between the phases with

gapless spectrum with low energy bulk conduction bands given by one parabolic

measurements, for the wave equation, is revisited. We propose a novel approach
to recover the unknown source through measuring the wave fields after injecting
small particles, enjoying a high contrast, into the medium. For this purpose,
we first derive the asymptotic expansion of the wave field, based on the
time-domain Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The dominant term in the asymptotic
expansion is expressed as an infinite series in terms of the eigenvalues
$\{\lambda_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of the Newtonian operator (for the pure
Laplacian). Such expansions are useful under a certain scale between the size
of the particles and their contrast. Second, we observe that the relevant
eigenvalues appearing in the expansion have non-zero averaged eigenfunctions.
We prove that the family $\{\sin(\frac{c_1}{\sqrt{\lambda_n}}\, t),\,
\cos(\frac{c_1}{\sqrt{\lambda_n}}\, t)\}$, for those relevant eigenvalues, with
$c_1$ as the contrast of the small particle, defines a Riesz basis (contrary to
the family corresponding to the whole sequence of eigenvalues). Then, using the
Riesz theory, we reconstruct the wave field, generated before injecting the
particles, on the center of the particles. Finally, from these (internal values
of these) last fields, we reconstruct the source term (by numerical
differentiation for instance). A significant advantage of our approach is that
we only need the measurements on $\{x\}\times(0, T)$ for a single point $x$
away from $\Omega$, i.e., the support of the source, and large enough $T$.

crystals and metamaterials to the time domain. However, despite the necessity
arising from the presence of non-reciprocal coupling between states in a
photonic Floquet medium, a unified non-Hermitian band structure description
remains elusive. Here, we experimentally reveal the unique Bloch-Floquet and
non-Bloch band structures of a photonic Floquet medium emulated in the
microwave regime with a one-dimensional array of time-periodically driven
resonators. Specifically, these non-Hermitian band structures are shown to be
two measurable distinct subsets of complex eigenfrequency surfaces of the
photonic Floquet medium defined in complex momentum space. In the Bloch-Floquet
band structure, the driving-induced non-reciprocal coupling between oppositely
signed frequency states leads to opening of momentum gaps along the real
momentum axis, at the edges of which exceptional phase transitions occur. More
interestingly, we show that the non-Bloch band structure defined in the complex
Brillouin zone supplements the information on the morphology of complex
eigenfrequency surfaces of the photonic Floquet medium. Our work paves the way
for a comprehensive understanding of photonic Floquet media in complex

energy~(${\cal E}_{r}^{\pm}$) and electromagnetic energy~(${\cal
E}_{em}^{\pm}$)} for a \emph{Kerr-Sen black hole~(BH)} having the event
horizon~(${\cal H}^{+}$) and the Cauchy horizon~(${\cal H}^{-}$).
Interestingly, we find that the \emph{sum of these three energies is equal to
the mass parameter i.e. ${\cal E}_{s}^{\pm}+{\cal E}_{r}^{\pm}+{\cal
E}_{em}^{\pm}={\cal M}$}. Moreover in terms of the \emph{ scale parameter
~$(\zeta_{\pm})$, the distortion parameter~($\xi_{\pm}$) and a new
parameter~$(\sigma_{\pm})$} which corresponds to the area~(${\cal A}_{\pm}$),
the angular momentum ~$(J)$ and the charge parameter~($Q$), we find that the
\emph{mass parameter in a compact form} ${\cal E}_{s}^{\pm}+{\cal
E}_{r}^{\pm}+{\cal E}_{em}^{\pm}={\cal M} =\frac{\zeta_{\pm} }{2}
\sqrt{\frac{1+2\,\sigma_{\pm}^2}{1-\xi_{\pm}^2}}$ %\begin{eqnarray} %{\cal

}{2} %\sqrt{\frac{1+2\,\sigma_{\pm}^2}{1-\xi_{\pm}^2}} \nonumber
%\end{eqnarray} which is valid {through all the horizons} (${\cal H}^{\pm}$).
We also compute the \emph{equatorial circumference and polar circumference}
which is a gross measure of the BH surface deformation. It is shown that when
the spinning rate of the BH increases, the \emph{equatorial circumference
increases} while the \emph{polar circumference decreases}. Furthermore, we
compute the exact expression of \emph{rotational energy that should be
extracted from the BH via the Penrose process}. The maximum value of rotational
energy which is extractable should occur for \emph{extremal Kerr-Sen BH} i.e.
${\cal E}_{r}^{+}%=\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{2}\right)\sqrt{2{\cal M}^2-Q^2}
=\left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)\sqrt{\frac{J}{2}}$.

detection is commonly caused by the tumor being obscured by its surrounding
breast tissues, a phenomenon called masking. To study and benchmark
mammographic masking of cancer, in this work we introduce CSAW-M, the largest
public mammographic dataset, collected from over 10,000 individuals and
annotated with potential masking. In contrast to the previous approaches which
measure breast image density as a proxy, our dataset directly provides
annotations of masking potential assessments from five specialists. We also
trained deep learning models on CSAW-M to estimate the masking level and showed
that the estimated masking is significantly more predictive of screening
participants diagnosed with interval and large invasive cancers -- without
being explicitly trained for these tasks -- than its breast density

incompressible near-equilibrium adverse-pressure-gradient (APG) turbulent
boundary layer (TBL) over a flat plate is presented. In this simulation, we
have established a near-equilibrium APG over a wide Reynolds-number range. In
this so-called region of interest (ROI), the Clauser--Rotta pressure-gradient
parameter $\beta$ exhibits an approximately constant value of around 1.4, and
the Reynolds number based on momentum thickness reaches $Re_{\theta}=8700$. To
the authors' knowledge, this is to date the highest $Re_{\theta}$ achieved for
a near-equilibrium APG TBL under an approximately constant moderate APG. We
evaluated the self-similarity of the outer region using two scalings, namely
the Zagarola--Smits and an alternative one based on edge velocity and
displacement thickness. Our results reveal that outer-layer similarity is
achieved, and the viscous scaling collapses the near-wall region of the mean
flow in agreement with classical theory. Spectral analysis reveals that the APG
displaces some small-scale energy from the near-wall to the outer region, an
effect observed for all the components of the Reynolds-stress tensor, which
becomes more evident at higher Reynolds numbers. Generally, the effects of the
APG are more noticeable at lower Reynolds numbers. For instance, the outer peak
of turbulent-kinetic-energy (TKE) production is less prominent at higher $Re$.
While the scale separation increases with $Re$ in zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG)
TBLs, this effect becomes accentuated by the APG. Despite the reduction of the
outer TKE production at higher Reynolds numbers, the mechanisms of energization
of large scales are still present.

design the Stationary Diffusion State Neural Estimation (SDSNE) to exploit
multiview structural graph information for co-supervised learning. We explore
how to design a graph neural network specially for unsupervised multiview
learning and integrate multiple graphs into a unified consensus graph by a
shared self-attentional module. The view-shared self-attentional module
utilizes the graph structure to learn a view-consistent global graph.
Meanwhile, instead of using auto-encoder in most unsupervised learning graph
neural networks, SDSNE uses a co-supervised strategy with structure information
to supervise the model learning. The co-supervised strategy as the loss
function guides SDSNE in achieving the stationary state. With the help of the
loss and the self-attentional module, we learn to obtain a graph in which nodes
in each connected component fully connect by the same weight. Experiments on
several multiview datasets demonstrate effectiveness of SDSNE in terms of six
clustering evaluation metrics.

accuracy of the theoretical analyses and demonstrate that: 1) The outage
probability of STAR-RIS-NOMA outperforms that of STAR-RIS assisted orthogonal
multiple access (OMA) and conventional cooperative communication systems; 2)
With the increasing of reflecting elements $K$ and Rician factor $\kappa $, the
STAR-RIS-NOMA networks are capable of attaining the enhanced performance; and
3) The ergodic rates of STAR-RIS-NOMA are superior to that of STAR-RIS-OMA.

much larger domain N, using the shortest-possible sequence of queries Q. A
feedback to a query provides some information about the intersection between
the query and subset K. Several specific feedbacks have been studied in the
literature, often proving different formulas for the estimate of the query
complexity of the problem, defined as the shortest length of queries' sequence
solving Group Testing problem with specific feedback. In this paper we study
what are the properties of the feedback that influence the query complexity of
Group Testing and what is their measurable impact. We propose a generic
framework that covers a vast majority of relevant settings considered in the
literature, which depends on two fundamental parameters of the feedback: input
capacity $\alpha$ and output expressiveness $\beta$. They upper bound the
logarithm of the size of the feedback function domain and image, respectively.
To justify the value of the framework, we prove upper bounds on query
complexity of non adaptive, deterministic Group Testing under some ""efficient""
feedbacks, for minimum, maximum and general expressiveness, and complement them
with a lower bound on all feedbacks with given parameters $\alpha,\beta$. Our
upper bounds also hold if the feedback function could get an input twisted by a
malicious adversary, in case the intersection of a query and the hidden set is
bigger than the feedback capacity $\alpha$. We also show that slight change in
the feedback function may result in substantial worsening of the query
complexity. Additionally, we analyze explicitly constructed randomized
counterparts of the deterministic results. Our results provide some insights to
what are the most useful bits of information an output-restricted feedback

collection of bi-disperse soft core frictionless disks in two dimensions - with
the aim to explore the finite size dependence of different quantities, both the
relaxation time obtained from the relaxation of the energy and the
pressure-equivalent of the shear viscosity. The motivation for the paper is the
observation [Nishikawa et al., J. Stat. Phys, 182, 37 (2021)] that there are
finite size effects in the relaxation time, $\tau$, that give problems in the
determination of the critical divergence, and the claim that this is due to a
finite size dependence, $\tau\sim\ln N$, which makes $\tau$ an ill-defined
quantity. Beside analyses to determine the relaxation time for the whole system
we determine particle relaxation times which allow us to determine both
histograms of particle relaxation times and the average particle relaxation
times - two quantities that are very useful for the analyses. The starting
configurations for the relaxation simulations are of two different kinds:
completely random or taken from steady shearing simulations, and we find that
the difference between these two cases are bigger than previously noted and
that the observed problems in the determination of the critical divergence
obtained when starting from random configurations are not present when instead
starting the relaxations from shearing configurations. We also argue that the
the effect that causes the $\ln N$-dependence is not as problematic as
asserted. When it comes to the finite size dependence of the
pressure-equivalent of the shear viscosity we find that our data don't give
support for the claimed strong finite size dependence, but also that it is at
odds with what one would normally expect for a system with a diverging
correlation length, and that this calls for a novel understanding of the

paper, we propose MegBA, a GPU-based distributed BA library. MegBA can provide
massive aggregated memory by automatically partitioning large BA problems, and
assigning the solvers of sub-problems to parallel nodes. The parallel solvers
adopt distributed Precondition Conjugate Gradient and distributed Schur
Elimination, so that an effective solution, which can match the precision of
those computed by a single node, can be efficiently computed. To accelerate BA
computation, we implement end-to-end BA computation using high-performance
primitives available on commodity GPUs. MegBA exposes easy-to-use APIs that are
compatible with existing popular BA libraries. Experiments show that MegBA can
significantly outperform state-of-the-art BA libraries: Ceres (41.45$\times$),
RootBA (64.576$\times$) and DeepLM (6.769$\times$) in several large-scale BA
benchmarks. The code of MegBA is available at

effect that provides the time evolution of magnetic vectors of a magnetic
system during its interaction with a laser pulse. We obtain a time-dependent
effective magnetic operator acting in the Hilbert space of the total angular
momentum that describes a process of nonthermal excitation of magnetic
precessions in an electronic system by a circularly polarized laser pulse. The
magnetic operator separates the effect of the laser pulse on the magnetic
system from other magnetic interactions. The effective magnetic operator
provides the equations of motion of magnetic vectors during the excitation by
the laser. We show that magnetization dynamics calculated with these equations
is equivalent to magnetization dynamics calculated with the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation, which takes into account the interaction of an
electronic system with the electric field of light. We model and compare
laser-induced precessions of magnetic sublattices of an easy-plane and an
easy-axis antiferromagnetic systems. Using these models, we show how the
ultrafast inverse Faraday effect induces a net magnetic moment in
antiferromagnets and demonstrate that a crystal field environment and the
exchange interaction play essential roles for laser-induced magnetization
dynamics even during the action of a pump pulse. Using our approach, we show
that light-induced precessions can start even during the action of the pump
pulse with a duration several tens times shorter than the period of induced
precessions and affect the position of magnetic vectors after the action of the
pump pulse.

aim to investigate the source of sunspot supersonic downflows (SSDs) in AR
12740 using simultaneous spectroscopic and imaging observations. We identified
SSD events from multiple raster scans of a sunspot by the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph, and calculated the electron densities, mass fluxes and
velocities of these SSDs. The EUV images provided by the AIA onboard the SDO
and the EUVI onboard the STEREO were employed to investigate the origin of
these SSDs and their associated coronal rain. Almost all the identified SSDs
appear at the footpoints of sunspot plumes and are temporally associated with
appearance of chromospheric bright dots inside the sunspot umbra.
Dual-perspective EUV imaging observations reveal a large-scale closed magnetic
loop system spanning the sunspot region and a remote region. We observed that
the SSDs are caused by repeated coronal rain that forms and flows along these
closed magnetic loops toward the sunspot. One episode of coronal rain clearly
indicates that reconnection near a coronal X-shaped structure first leads to
the formation of a magnetic dip. Subsequently, hot coronal plasma
catastrophically cools from 2 MK in the dip region via thermal instability.
This results in the formation of a transient prominence in the dip, from which
the cool gas mostly slides into the sunspot along inclined magnetic fields
under the gravity. This drainage process manifests as a continuous rain flow,
which lasts for around 2 hrs and concurrently results in a nearly steady SSD
event. Our results demonstrate that coronal condensation in magnetic dips can
result in the quasi-steady sunspot supersonic downflows.

every 1.2 T that are metastable with very slow dynamics. This has puzzled the
community for many years and given rise to numerous potential theories. Here we
approach the problem by seeking the elusive magnetic equilibrium state at T = 2
K. To this end, we explore two approaches: (1) bypassing the slow dynamics
produced by changing fields by instead field-cooling directly to the target
temperature, and (2) quantum annealing in transverse magnetic fields. While we
observe no measurable effect of the quantum annealing in fields up to 7 T,
which is likely due to the large Ising anisotropy of Co spins in this material,
we find that for the field cooling in longitudinal fields we achieve the
predicted equilibrium 1/3 magnetization. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of
the ground state phase diagram and we also simulate the quantum annealing
process and find good agreement between experiment and theory. Thus we present
an investigation of the elusive ground state properties of the canonical

softwares require human input and manual tuning of parameters. Expert operators
must navigate low- and medium-magnification images to find good
high-magnification collection locations. Automating this is non-trivial: the

salient object detection from natural scene images (NSI-SOD); by contrast,
salient object detection in optical remote sensing images (RSI-SOD) remains to
be a challenging emerging topic. The unique characteristics of optical RSIs,
such as scales, illuminations and imaging orientations, bring significant
differences between NSI-SOD and RSI-SOD. In this paper, we propose a novel
Multi-Content Complementation Network (MCCNet) to explore the complementarity
of multiple content for RSI-SOD. Specifically, MCCNet is based on the general
encoder-decoder architecture, and contains a novel key component named
Multi-Content Complementation Module (MCCM), which bridges the encoder and the
decoder. In MCCM, we consider multiple types of features that are critical to
RSI-SOD, including foreground features, edge features, background features, and
global image-level features, and exploit the content complementarity between
them to highlight salient regions over various scales in RSI features through
the attention mechanism. Besides, we comprehensively introduce pixel-level,
map-level and metric-aware losses in the training phase. Extensive experiments
on two popular datasets demonstrate that the proposed MCCNet outperforms 23
state-of-the-art methods, including both NSI-SOD and RSI-SOD methods. The code

Processing (NLP) that uses intelligent computer software to understand texts
that encode human knowledge. Recent years have witnessed notable progress
across various NLU tasks with deep learning techniques, especially with
pretrained language models. Besides proposing more advanced model
architectures, constructing more reliable and trustworthy datasets also plays a
huge role in improving NLU systems, without which it would be impossible to
train a decent NLU model. It's worth noting that the human ability of
understanding natural language is flexible and robust. On the contrary, most of
existing NLU systems fail to achieve desirable performance on out-of-domain
data or struggle on handling challenging items (e.g., inherently ambiguous
items, adversarial items) in the real world. Therefore, in order to have NLU
models understand human language more effectively, it is expected to prioritize
the study on robust natural language understanding. In this thesis, we deem
that NLU systems are consisting of two components: NLU models and NLU datasets.
As such, we argue that, to achieve robust NLU, the model architecture/training
and the dataset are equally important. Specifically, we will focus on three NLU
tasks to illustrate the robustness problem in different NLU tasks and our
contributions (i.e., novel models and new datasets) to help achieve more robust
natural language understanding. Moving forward, the ultimate goal for robust
natural language understanding is to build NLU models which can behave humanly.
That is, it's expected that robust NLU systems are capable to transfer the
knowledge from training corpus to unseen documents more reliably and survive
when encountering challenging items even if the system doesn't know a priori of
users' inputs.

based on the concepts of model order reduction and domain decomposition to
construct a multi-block approach. A generic block model is built to represent a
group of interconnect blocks that are used to wire standard cells in the
integrated circuits (ICs). The blocks in this group possess identical geometry
with various metal/via routings. The data-driven model reduction method is thus
applied to learn material property variations induced by different metal/via
routings in the blocks, in addition to the variations of heat sources and BCs.
The approach is investigated in two very different settings. It is first
applied to thermal simulation of a single interconnect block with similar BCs
to those in the training of the generic block. It is then implemented in
multi-block thermal simulation of a FinFET IC, where the interconnect structure
is partitioned into several blocks each modeled by the generic block model.
Accuracy of the generic block model is examined in terms of the metal/via
routings, BCs and thermal discontinuities at the block interfaces.

for the coordination of electric power generation. These markets rely evermore
on short-term trading to facilitate the balancing of power generation and
demand and to enable systems integration of small producers. Electricity prices
in these spot markets show pronounced fluctuations, featuring extreme peaks as
well as occasional negative prices. In this article, we analyse electricity
price time series from the European EPEX market, in particular the hourly
day-ahead, hourly intraday, and 15-min intraday market prices. We quantify the
fluctuations, correlations, and extreme events and reveal different time scales
in the dynamics of the market. The short-term fluctuations show remarkably
different characteristics for time scales below and above 12 hours.
Fluctuations are strongly correlated and persistent below 12 hours, which
contributes to extreme price events and a strong multifractal behaviour. On
longer time scales, they get anti-correlated and price time series revert to
their mean, witnessed by a stark decrease of the Hurst coefficient after 12
hours. The long-term behaviour is strongly influenced by the evolution of a
large-scale weather patterns with a typical time scale of four days. We
elucidate this dependence in detail using a classification into circulation
weather types. The separation in time scales enables a superstatistical
treatment, which confirms the characteristic time scale of four days, and
motivates the use of $q$-Gaussian distributions as the best fit to the empiric
distribution of electricity prices.

covariance function is utilized as the kernel for the $\mathcal{GP}$. The
ground surface behavior is assumed to only demonstrate local-smoothness. Thus,
point estimates of the kernel's length-scales are obtained. Thus, two Gaussian
processes are introduced to separately model the observation and local
characteristics of the data. While, the \textit{observation process} is used to
model the ground, the \textit{latent process} is put on length-scale values to
estimate point values of length-scales at each input location. Input locations
for this latent process are chosen in a physically-motivated procedure to
represent an intuition about ground condition. Furthermore, an intuitive guess
of length-scale value is represented by assuming the existence of hypothetical
surfaces in the environment that every bunch of data points may be assumed to
be resulted from measurements from this surfaces. Bayesian inference is
implemented using \textit{maximum a Posteriori} criterion. The log-marginal
likelihood function is assumed to be a multi-task objective function, to
represent a whole-frame unbiased view of the ground at each frame. Simulation
results shows the effectiveness of the proposed method even in an uneven, rough
scene which outperforms similar Gaussian process based ground segmentation
methods. While adjacent segments do not have similar ground structure in an

with Reinforcement Learning (NEORL) developed at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. NEORL offers a global optimization interface of state-of-the-art
algorithms in the field of evolutionary computation, neural networks through
reinforcement learning, and hybrid neuroevolution algorithms. NEORL features
diverse set of algorithms, user-friendly interface, parallel computing support,
automatic hyperparameter tuning, detailed documentation, and demonstration of
applications in mathematical and real-world engineering optimization. NEORL
encompasses various optimization problems from combinatorial, continuous, mixed
discrete/continuous, to high-dimensional, expensive, and constrained
engineering optimization. NEORL is tested in variety of engineering
applications relevant to low carbon energy research in addressing solutions to
climate change. The examples include nuclear reactor control and fuel cell
power production. The results demonstrate NEORL competitiveness against other
algorithms and optimization frameworks in the literature, and a potential tool
to solve large-scale optimization problems. More examples and benchmarking of
NEORL can be found here: https://neorl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
