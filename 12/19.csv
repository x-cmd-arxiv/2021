of circularly and linearly polarization, on the emergence of quantum phases on
thin topological insulators. Simultaneously, the influence of the system
parameters (such as magnetic impurity, thickness engineering and structural
inversion asymmetry of the potential) on emergence of topological phases is
studied. We take our attention to the high frequency regime in which it is
possible to consider an expansion for the Floquet Hamiltonian in terms of
orders of 1/\Omega. The topological invariants are determined and it is
demonstrated that some phase transitions between quantum anomalous Hall
insulator, quantum pseudospin Hall insulator, quantum spin Hall insulator and
normal insulator can be induced by altering the aforementioned parameters of
the system. To avoid heating process, tuning of the system parameters gives us
the opportunity to observe these phase transitions at small intensities of
light.

  Dimensionality When Approximating High Dimensional Functions",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explain how to use Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST) to break the
curse of dimension when approximating continuous multivariate functions. We
first show that there is a class of functions called $K$-Lipschitz continuous
and can be approximated by a ReLU neural network of two layers to have an
approximation order $O(d^2/n)$, and then we introduce the K-modulus of
continuity of multivariate functions and derive the approximation rate for any
continuous function $f\in C([0,1]^d)$ based on KST. Next we introduce
KB-splines by using uniform B-splines to replace the K-outer function and their
smooth version called LKB-splines to approximate high dimensional functions.
Our numerical evidence shows that the curse of dimension is broken in the
following sense. When using the standard discrete least squares method (DLS) to
approximate a continuous function $f$ over $[0, 1]^d$, one expects to use a
dense data set $P$, a large number of data locations and function values over
the locations. Based on the LKB splines, the structure of K-inner functions
leads to a sparse solution of the linear system associated with the DLS.
Furthermore, there exists a magic set of points from $P$ with much small in
size such that the rooted mean squares error (RMSE) from the DLS based on the
magic set is similar to the RMSE of the DLS based on the original set $P$. In
addition, the number of LKB-splines used for approximation is the same as the
size of the magic data set. Hence we not need a lot of basis functions and a
lot of data locations and function values to approximate a high dimensional
continuous function $f$ when $f$ is not very oscillated.

neural networks more effective, the scientific community developed strategies
to order the examples according to their estimated complexity, to distil
knowledge from larger networks, or to exploit the principles behind adversarial
machine learning. A different idea has been recently proposed, named Friendly
Training, which consists in altering the input data by adding an automatically
estimated perturbation, with the goal of facilitating the learning process of a
neural classifier. The transformation progressively fades-out as long as
training proceeds, until it completely vanishes. In this work we revisit and
extend this idea, introducing a radically different and novel approach inspired
by the effectiveness of neural generators in the context of Adversarial Machine
Learning. We propose an auxiliary multi-layer network that is responsible of
altering the input data to make them easier to be handled by the classifier at
the current stage of the training procedure. The auxiliary network is trained
jointly with the neural classifier, thus intrinsically increasing the 'depth'
of the classifier, and it is expected to spot general regularities in the data
alteration process. The effect of the auxiliary network is progressively
reduced up to the end of training, when it is fully dropped and the classifier
is deployed for applications. We refer to this approach as Neural Friendly
Training. An extended experimental procedure involving several datasets and
different neural architectures shows that Neural Friendly Training overcomes
the originally proposed Friendly Training technique, improving the
generalization of the classifier, especially in the case of noisy data.

too low. To address this ""open flux problem,'' we reanalyze the magnetograph
measurements from different observatories, with particular focus on those made
in the saturation-prone Fe I 525.0 nm line by the Mount Wilson Observatory
(MWO) and the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO). The total dipole strengths, which
determine the total open flux, generally show large variations among
observatories, even when their total photospheric fluxes are in agreement.
However, the MWO and WSO dipole strengths, as well as their total fluxes, agree
remarkably well with each other, suggesting that the two data sets require the
same scaling factor. As shown earlier by Ulrich et al., the saturation
correction $\delta^{-1}$ derived by comparing MWO measurements in the 525.0 nm
line with those in the nonsaturating Fe I 523.3 nm line depends sensitively on
where along the irregularly shaped 523.3 nm line wings the exit slits are
placed. If the slits are positioned so that the 523.3 and 525.0 nm signals
originate from the same height, $\delta^{-1}$ ~ 4.5 at disk center, falling to
~2 near the limb. When this correction is applied to either the MWO or WSO
maps, the derived open fluxes are consistent with the observed IMF magnitude.
Other investigators obtained scaling factors only one-half as large because
they sampled the 523.3 nm line farther out in the wings, where the shift
between the right- and left-circularly polarized components is substantially
smaller.

  It was a cross-sectional comparative study with confirmed ODD (105 eyes),
papilledema due to high intracranial pressure (51 eyes), and healthy controls
(100 eyes). 3D scans of the ONHs were acquired using OCT, then processed to
improve deep-tissue visibility. At first, a deep learning algorithm was
developed using 984 B-scans (from 130 eyes) in order to identify: major
neural/connective tissues, and ODD regions. The performance of our algorithm
was assessed using the Dice coefficient (DC). In a 2nd step, a classification
algorithm (random forest) was designed using 150 OCT volumes to perform 3-class

and prelamina swelling scores (derived from the segmentations). To assess
performance, we reported the area under the receiver operating characteristic

  Our segmentation algorithm was able to isolate neural and connective tissues,
and ODD regions whenever present. This was confirmed by an average DC of
0.93$\pm$0.03 on the test set, corresponding to good performance.
Classification was achieved with high AUCs, i.e. 0.99$\pm$0.01 for the
detection of ODD, 0.99 $\pm$ 0.01 for the detection of papilledema, and
0.98$\pm$0.02 for the detection of healthy ONHs.
  Our AI approach accurately discriminated ODD from papilledema, using a single
OCT scan. Our classification performance was excellent, with the caveat that
validation in a much larger population is warranted. Our approach may have the
potential to establish OCT as the mainstay of diagnostic imaging in

  natural language descriptions",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, several approaches have explored the detection and classification
of objects in videos to perform Zero-Shot Action Recognition with remarkable
results. In these methods, class-object relationships are used to associate
visual patterns with the semantic side information because these relationships
also tend to appear in texts. Therefore, word vector methods would reflect them
in their latent representations. Inspired by these methods and by video
captioning's ability to describe events not only with a set of objects but with
contextual information, we propose a method in which video captioning models,
called observers, provide different and complementary descriptive sentences. We
demonstrate that representing videos with descriptive sentences instead of deep
features, in ZSAR, is viable and naturally alleviates the domain adaptation
problem, as we reached state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the UCF101
dataset and competitive performance on HMDB51 without their training sets. We
also demonstrate that word vectors are unsuitable for building the semantic
embedding space of our descriptions. Thus, we propose to represent the classes
with sentences extracted from documents acquired with search engines on the
Internet, without any human evaluation on the quality of descriptions. Lastly,
we build a shared semantic space employing BERT-based embedders pre-trained in
the paraphrasing task on multiple text datasets. We show that this pre-training
is essential for bridging the semantic gap. The projection onto this space is
straightforward for both types of information, visual and semantic, because
they are sentences, enabling the classification with nearest neighbour rule in
this shared space. Our code is available at

for two classes of signatures; ALPs coupled primarily to photons can be
produced in the tungsten target via the Primakoff process, and then produce a
gamma-ray signal in the Liquid Argon (LAr) CCM detector either via inverse
Primakoff scattering or decay to a photon pair. ALPs with significant electron
couplings have several additional production mechanisms (Compton scattering,
$e^+e^-$ annihilation, ALP-bremsstrahlung) and detection modes (inverse Compton
scattering, external $e^+e^-$ pair conversion, and decay to $e^+e^-$). In some
regions, the constraint is marginally better than both astrophysical and
terrestrial constraints. With the beginning of a three year run, CCM will be
more sensitive to this parameter space by up to an order of magnitude for both
ALP-photon and ALP-electron couplings. The CCM experiment will also have
sensitivity to well-motivated parameter space of QCD axion models. It is only a
recent realization that accelerator-based large volume liquid argon detectors
designed for low energy coherent neutrino and dark matter scattering searches

polarization dependence of the probed XANES spectra, which concerns mainly an
increase of the intensity of electronic transitions when the beam polarization
is set out of the sample's $ab$ crystallographic plane. The results show that
states with $p_{z}$-orbital character dominate the density of unoccupied states
close to the Fermi level. Partial substitution of Fe by Co is shown to decrease
the intensity anisotropy, suggesting that Co promotes electronic transfer
preferentially to states with $p_{z}$-orbital character. On the other hand, Mn
substitution causes the increase of the spectra $p_{z}$-orbital anisotropy,
which is proposed to take place by means of an enhanced local Fe $3d4p$ mixing,
unveiling the role of Fe $4p$ states in the localization of the Fe $3d$

identify the relative mixing between Fe and the pnictide $4p_{x,y,z}$ orbitals

  Higher Precision",,,,,"cs.NI cs.DB cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key-value cache is a key component of many services to provide low-latency
and high-throughput data accesses to a huge amount of data. To improve the
end-to-end performance of such services, a key-value cache must achieve a high
cache hit ratio with high throughput. In this paper, we propose a new cache
replacement algorithm, multi-step LRU, which achieves high throughput by
efficiently exploiting SIMD instructions without using per-item additional
memory (LRU metadata) to record information such as the last access timestamp.
For a small set of items that can fit within a vector register, SIMD-based LRU
management without LRU metadata is known (in-vector LRU). It remembers the
access history by reordering items in one vector using vector shuffle
instruction. In-vector LRU alone cannot be used for a caching system since it
can manage only few items. Set-associative cache is a straightforward way to
build a large cache using in-vector LRU as a building block. However, a naive
set-associative cache based on in-vector LRU has a poorer cache hit ratio than
the original LRU although it can achieve a high throughput. Our multi-step LRU
enhances naive set-associative cache based on in-vector LRU for improving cache
accuracy by taking both access frequency and access recency of items into
account while keeping the efficiency by SIMD instructions. Our results indicate
that multi-step LRU outperforms the original LRU and GCLOCK algorithms in terms
of both execution speed and cache hit ratio. Multi-step LRU improves the cache
hit ratios over the original LRU by implicitly taking access frequency of items
as well as access recency into account. The cache hit ratios of multi-step LRU
are similar to those of ARC, which achieves a higher a cache hit ratio in a
tradeoff for using more LRU metadata.

can cause their surface composition to change radically as they cool, a
phenomenon known as spectral evolution. In this paper, we undertake a
comprehensive theoretical investigation of the spectral evolution of white
dwarfs. First, we introduce STELUM, a new implementation of the stellar
evolutionary code developed at the Universit\'e de Montr\'eal. We provide a
thorough description of the physical content and numerical techniques of the
code, covering the treatment of both stellar evolution and chemical transport.
Then, we present two state-of-the-art numerical simulations of element
transport in evolving white dwarfs. Atomic diffusion, convective mixing, and
mass loss are considered simultaneously as time-dependent diffusive processes
and are fully coupled to the cooling. We first model the PG 1159$-$DO$-$DB$-$DQ
evolutionary channel: a helium-, carbon-, and oxygen-rich PG 1159 star
transforms into a pure-helium DB white dwarf due to gravitational settling, and
then into a helium-dominated, carbon-polluted DQ white dwarf through convective
dredge-up. We also compute for the first time the full DO$-$DA$-$DC
evolutionary channel: a helium-rich DO white dwarf harboring residual hydrogen
becomes a pure-hydrogen DA star through the float-up process, and then a
helium-dominated, hydrogen-bearing DC star due to convective mixing. We
demonstrate that our results are in excellent agreement with available
empirical constraints. In particular, our DO$-$DA$-$DC simulation perfectly
reproduces the lower branch of the bifurcation observed in the Gaia
color-magnitude diagram, which can therefore be interpreted as a signature of
spectral evolution.

consideration may be composed of a varying number of nodes. Therefore, it is
necessary to design pooling methods that aggregate the graph representations of
varying size to representations of fixed size which can be used in downstream
tasks, such as graph classification. Existing graph pooling methods offer no
guarantee with regards to the similarity of a graph representation and its
pooled version. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing FlowPool,
a pooling method that optimally preserves the statistics of a graph
representation to its pooled counterpart by minimising their Wasserstein
distance. This is achieved by performing a Wasserstein gradient flow with
respect to the pooled graph representation. Our method relies on a versatile
implementation which can take into account the geometry of the representation
space through any ground cost and computes the gradient of the Wasserstein
distance with automatic differentiation. We propose the differentiation of the
Wasserstein flow layer using an implicit differentiation scheme. Therefore, our
pooling method is amenable to automatic differentiation and can be integrated
in end-to-end deep learning architectures. Further, FlowPool is invariant to
permutations and can therefore be combined with permutation equivariant feature
extraction layers in GNNs in order to obtain predictions that are independent
of the ordering of the nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
leads to an increase in performance compared to existing pooling methods when
evaluated on graph classification.

platforms rely heavily on geospatial technologies, most critically predictions
of the time required for a vehicle to traverse a particular route, or the
so-called estimated time of arrival (ETA). There are various methods used in
practice, which differ in terms of the geographic granularity at which the
predictive model is trained -- e.g., segment-based methods predict travel time
at the level of road segments (or a combination of several adjacent road
segments) and then aggregate across the route, whereas route-based methods use
generic information about the trip, such as origin and destination, to predict
travel time. Though various forms of these methods have been developed, there
has been no rigorous theoretical comparison regarding their accuracies, and
empirical studies have, in many cases, drawn opposite conclusions.
  We provide the first theoretical analysis of the predictive accuracy of
various ETA prediction methods. In a finite-sample setting, we give mild
conditions under which a segment-based method is more accurate than a wide
variety of route-based methods. Then we analyze an asymptotic setting in which
the number of trip observations grows with the size of the road network. Under
a broad range of trip-generating processes on a grid network, we show that a
class of very simple segment-based methods is at least as good, up to a
logarithmic factor, as any possible predictor. In other words, segment-based
methods are asymptotically optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Our work
highlights that the accuracy of ETA prediction is driven not just by the
sophistication of the model but also by the spatial granularity at which those
methods are applied.

functions are known to provide good approximations to the support of
probability distributions. In addition to reachability analysis, the same
approach can be applied to general problems of estimating the support of a
random variable, which has applications in data science towards detection of
novelties and outliers in data sets. In applications where safety is a concern,
having a guarantee of accuracy that holds on finite data sets is critical. In
this paper, we prove such bounds for our algorithms under the Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) framework. In addition to applying classical
Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension bound arguments, we apply the PAC-Bayes
theorem by leveraging a formal connection between kernelized empirical inverse
Christoffel functions and Gaussian process regression models. The bound based
on PAC-Bayes applies to a more general class of Christoffel functions than the
VC dimension argument, and achieves greater sample efficiency in experiments.

integrated into reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks to effectively learn
agents that control the grid's topology to prevent thermal cascading. Typical
RL-based topology controllers fail to perform well due to the large
search/optimization space. Here, we propose an actor-critic-based agent to
address the problem's combinatorial nature and train the agent using the RL
environment developed by RTE, the French TSO. To address the challenge of the
large optimization space, a curriculum-based approach with reward tuning is
incorporated into the training procedure by modifying the environment using
network physics for enhanced agent learning. Further, a parallel training
approach on multiple scenarios is employed to avoid biasing the agent to a few
scenarios and make it robust to the natural variability in grid operations.
Without these modifications to the training procedure, the RL agent failed for
most test scenarios, illustrating the importance of properly integrating domain
knowledge of physical systems for real-world RL learning. The agent was tested
by RTE for the 2019 learning to run the power network challenge and was awarded
the 2nd place in accuracy and 1st place in speed. The developed code is

become inaccurate near the surface of the small body or have high computational
costs, especially for binary or heterogeneous small bodies. New learning-based
techniques do not encode a predefined structure and are more versatile. In
exchange for versatility, learning-based techniques can be less robust outside
the training data domain. In deployment, the spacecraft trajectory is the
primary source of dynamics data. Therefore, the training data domain should
include spacecraft trajectories to accurately evaluate the learned model's
safety and robustness. We have developed a novel method for learning-based
gravity models that directly uses the spacecraft's past trajectories. We
further introduce a method to evaluate the safety and robustness of

displacements in two-dimensional (2D) materials under electron beam
irradiation. However, these models often drastically underestimate the
displacement rates in 2D insulators, in which beam-induced electronic
excitations can reduce the binding energies of the irradiated atoms. This bond
softening leads to a qualitative disagreement between theory and experiment, in
that substantial sputtering is experimentally observed at beam energies deemed
far to small to drive atomic dislocation by many current models. To address
these theoretical shortcomings, this paper develops a first-principles method
to calculate the probability of beam-induced electronic excitations by coupling
quantum electrodynamics (QED) scattering amplitudes to density functional
theory (DFT) single-particle orbitals. The presented theory then explicitly
considers the effect of these electronic excitations on the sputtering cross
section. Applying this method to 2D hexagonal BN and MoS$_2$ significantly
increases their calculated sputtering cross sections and correctly yields
appreciable sputtering rates at beam energies previously predicted to leave the

describe a rich variety of beam-driven phenomena in any crystalline material.

nonorthogonal quantum states lies at the core of quantum theory and constitutes
a primitive for secure quantum communication. Demanding determinism leads to
errors, while demanding certainty leads to some inconclusiveness. One of the
most fundamental strategies developed for this task is the optimal unambiguous
measurement. It encompasses conclusive results, which allow for error-free
state retrodictions with the maximum success probability, and inconclusive
results, which are discarded for not allowing perfect identifications.
Interestingly, in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces the inconclusive results may
contain valuable information about the input states. Here, we theoretically
describe and experimentally demonstrate the discrimination of nonorthogonal
states from both conclusive and inconclusive results in the optimal unambiguous
strategy, by concatenating a minimum-error measurement at its inconclusive
space. Our implementation comprises 4- and 9-dimensional spatially encoded
photonic states. By accessing the inconclusive space to retrieve the
information that is wasted in the conventional protocol, we achieve significant
increases of up to a factor of 2.07 and 3.73, respectively, in the overall
probabilities of correct retrodictions. The concept of concatenated optimal
measurements demonstrated here can be extended to other strategies and will
enable one to explore the full potential of high-dimensional nonorthogonal

efficiently-computable quantum states that are computationally
indistinguishable from Haar-random states. One-way functions imply the
existence of pseudorandom states, but Kretschmer (TQC'20) recently constructed
an oracle relative to which there are no one-way functions but pseudorandom
states still exist. Motivated by this, we study the intriguing possibility of
basing interesting cryptographic tasks on pseudorandom states.
  We construct, assuming the existence of pseudorandom state generators that
map a $\lambda$-bit seed to a $\omega(\log\lambda)$-qubit state, (a)
statistically binding and computationally hiding commitments and (b) pseudo
one-time encryption schemes. A consequence of (a) is that pseudorandom states
are sufficient to construct maliciously secure multiparty computation protocols
in the dishonest majority setting.
  Our constructions are derived via a new notion called pseudorandom
function-like states (PRFS), a generalization of pseudorandom states that
parallels the classical notion of pseudorandom functions. Beyond the above two
applications, we believe our notion can effectively replace pseudorandom
functions in many other cryptographic applications.

de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, this version allowing the spacelike nonlocality
and the configuration space ontology of the original model to be avoided via
the addition of retrocausality. Two different features of this alternative
formulation are considered here. With regard to probabilities, it is shown that
the model provides a derivation of the Born rule identical to that in Bohm's
original formulation. This derivation holds just as well for a many-particle,
entangled state as for a single particle. With regard to ""certainties"", the
description of a particles spin is examined within the model and it is seen
that a statistical description is no longer necessary once final boundary
conditions are specified in addition to the usual initial state, with the
particle then possessing a definite (but hidden) value for every spin component
at intermediate times. These values are consistent with being the components of
a single, underlying spin vector. The case of a two-particle entangled spin
state is also examined and it is found that, due to the retrocausal aspect,
each particle possesses its own definite spin during the entanglement,
independent of the other particle. In formulating this picture, it is
demonstrated how such a realistic model can preserve Lorentz invariance in the
face of Bell's theorem and avoid the need for a preferred reference frame.

considered as valuable resources for fuelling quantum information-theoretic
protocols. EPR-steering is a property that is more general than
Bell-nonlocality and yet more restrictive than entanglement. Quantum discord on
the other hand, captures non-classical behaviour beyond that of entanglement,
and its study has remained of active research interest during the past two
decades. Exploring the behaviour of these quantum properties in different
physical scenarios, like those simulated by open quantum systems, is therefore
of crucial importance for understanding their viability for quantum
technologies. In this work, we analyse the behaviour of EPR-steering,
entanglement, and quantum discord, for two-qubit states under various quantum
processes. First, we consider the three noisy channel scenarios of; phase
damping, generalised amplitude damping and stochastic dephasing channel.
Second, we explore the behaviour of these quantum properties in an entanglement
swapping scenario. We quantify EPR-steering by means of an inequality with
three-input two-output measurement settings, and address quantum discord as the
interferometric power of quantum states. Our findings are the following. First,
we show that some of the relatively straightforward noisy channels here
considered, can induce non-trivial dynamics such as sudden death as well as
death and revival of EPR-steering and entanglement. Second, we find that
although noisy channels in general reduce the amount of correlations present in
the system, the swapping protocol on the other hand displays scenarios where
these quantum correlations can be enhanced. These results therefore illustrate
that quantum processes do not exclusively affect the quantum properties of
physical systems in a negative manner, but that they can also have positive
effects on such properties.

Android malware, which are from network traffic and code graph structure. In
hybrid-Flacon, we treat network traffic as a dynamic feature and process it as
a 2D image sequence. Meanwhile, hybrid-Flacon handles each network flow in the
packet as a 2D image and uses a bidirectional LSTM network to process those

has significantly exploded. It is arguably one of the most viral problems on
mobile platforms. Recently, various approaches have been introduced to detect
Android malware, the majority of these are either based on the Manifest File
features or the structural information, such as control flow graph and API
calls. Among those methods, nearly all of them only consider the Java byte-code
as the target to detect malicious behaviors. However, Recent research and our
own statistics show that native payloads are commonly used in both benign and
malicious apps. Current state-of-the-art Android static analysis tools avoid
handling native method invocation. None of those tools have the capability to
capture the inter-language behaviors.
  In this work, we explore an ensemble mechanism, which presents how the
combination of byte-code and native-code analysis of Android applications can
be efficiently used to cope with the advanced sophistication of Android
malware. We, therefore, present a multi-layer approach that utilizes deep
learning, natural language processing (NLP), as well as graph embedding
techniques to handle the threats of Android malware, both from the Java
byte-code and native code. After that, we design an ensemble algorithm to get
the final result of malware detection system. To be specific, the first layer
of our detection approach operates on the byte-code of application and the
native code level, whereas the second layer focuses on the ensemble algorithm.
Large-scale experiments on 100,113 samples (35,113 malware and 65,000 benign)
show that only byte-code sub-system yields 99.8% accuracy and native-code
sub-system yields an accuracy of 96.6%, whereas the Android-COCO method attains
an accuracy of 99.86% which outperforms various related works.

matching a joint distribution involving the conditional generator and the

propagation environments. Due to its feature of controlling the wireless
environment, reconfigurable intelligent surface~(RIS) is appealing to be
applied in PKG. In this paper, in contrast to the existing literature, we
investigate both the constructive and destructive effects of RIS on the PKG

wave-blockage environments as two RIS-empowered-PKG applications in future
wireless systems. In particular, our experimental results in a static
environment showed that RIS can enhance the entropy of the secret key,
achieving a key generation rate (KGR) of 97.39 bit/s with a bit disagreement
rate (BDR) of 0.083. In multi-user systems where some remote users are in worse
channel conditions, the proposed RIS-assisted PKG algorithm improves the sum
secret key rate by more than 2 dB, compared to the literature. Furthermore, we
point out that RIS could be utilized by an attacker to perform new jamming and

future research directions for PKG systems in light of the RIS.

Recent work has largely focused on adopting more complicated degradation models
to emulate real-world degradations. The resulting models have made
breakthroughs in perceptual loss and yield perceptually convincing results.
However, the limitation brought by current generative adversarial network
structures is still significant: treating pixels equally leads to the ignorance
of the image's structural features, and results in performance drawbacks such
as twisted lines and background over-sharpening or blurring. In this paper, we
present A-ESRGAN, a GAN model for blind SR tasks featuring an attention U-Net

generators. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce attention
U-Net structure as the discriminator of GAN to solve blind SR problems. And the
paper also gives an interpretation for the mechanism behind multi-scale
attention U-Net that brings performance breakthrough to the model. Through
comparison experiments with prior works, our model presents state-of-the-art
level performance on the non-reference natural image quality evaluator metric.
And our ablation studies have shown that with our discriminator, the RRDB based

quality of distillation. The reason for the suboptimal distillation of a large
network (teacher) to a smaller network (student) is largely attributed to the
gap in the learning capacities of given teacher-student pair. While it is hard
to distill all the knowledge of a teacher, the quality of distillation can be
controlled to a large extent to achieve better performance. Our experiments
show that the quality of distillation is largely governed by the quality of
teacher's response, which in turn is heavily affected by the presence of
similarity information in its response. A well-trained large capacity teacher
loses similarity information between classes in the process of learning
fine-grained discriminative properties for classification. The absence of
similarity information causes the distillation process to be reduced from one
example-many class learning to one example-one class learning, thereby
throttling the flow of diverse knowledge from the teacher. With the implicit
assumption that only the instilled knowledge can be distilled, instead of
focusing only on the knowledge distilling process, we scrutinize the knowledge
inculcation process. We argue that for a given teacher-student pair, the
quality of distillation can be improved by finding the sweet spot between batch
size and number of epochs while training the teacher. We discuss the steps to
find this sweet spot for better distillation. We also propose the distillation
hypothesis to differentiate the behavior of the distillation process between
knowledge distillation and regularization effect. We conduct all our
experiments on three different datasets.

dynamics of a blunted flat plate at Mach~$4$ are numerically investigated
through linear and nonlinear approaches. Linear wavepacket analysis reveals
amplifying oblique first-modes as well as planar and oblique entropy-layer
disturbances. The receptivity of entropic-instabilities is found to be largest
for actuation seeded in the entropy-layer; the corresponding linear evolution
is characterized by an intensification in the wall-normal plane, coupled with
streamwise tilting. The transition process that arises from entropy-layer wave
interactions via the oblique breakdown mechanism is examined in detail. Oblique
entropy-layer disturbances interact non-linearly with each other and induce
streamwise streaks in the boundary-layer. These undergo further destabilization
downstream, through a combination of lift-up and Orr-like mechanisms, leading
to turbulence onset. Sinuous subharmonic oscillations induced by the
entropic-disturbances are the dominant streak instabilities. Slanted
hook-shaped structures are observed in the temperature perturbations, and are
attributed to an Orr-like mechanism in the entropy-layer. Further, temperature
perturbations amplify on the crests of the low-speed streaks in the
entropy-layer and generate disturbances through triadic interactions. These
disturbances aid in the transfer of perturbation energy into the
boundary-layer, eventually leading to spanwise homogenization and near-wall
streak generation. Towards the end of the breakdown region, spectral broadening
accompanied by the appearance of an inertial sub-range in the boundary-layer
indicates the approach of the flow towards turbulence.

given code segments when they attempt to answer the questions. Unfortunately,
such code segments could not always reproduce the issues due to several unmet
challenges (e.g., external library not found) that might prevent questions from
receiving prompt and appropriate solutions. A previous study produced a catalog
of potential challenges that hinder the reproducibility of issues reported at
SO questions. However, it is unknown how the practitioners (i.e., developers)
perceive the challenge catalog. Understanding the developers' perspective is
inevitable to introduce interactive tool support that promotes reproducibility.
We thus attempt to understand developers' perspectives by surveying 53 users of
SO. In particular, we attempt to -- (1) see developers' viewpoints on the
agreement to those challenges, (2) find the potential impact of those
challenges, (3) see how developers address them, and (4) determine and

additional challenges (e.g., error log missing) that might prevent
reproducibility. According to the participants, too short code segment and
absence of required Class/Interface/Method from code segments severely prevent
reproducibility, followed by missing important part of code. To promote

efficiency of this framework with adaptive strategies. The adaptive strategies
are based on the magnitude of radiation and the electric field during the
streamer propagation, and are applied to the selection of the source and target
points. The accuracy and efficiency of this adaptive FMM are studied
quantitatively for different domain sizes, pressures and adaptive criteria, in
comparison with some existing efficient approaches to compute the
photoionization. It is shown that appropriate adaptive strategies reduce the
calculation time of the FMM greatly, and maintain the high accuracy that the
numerical error is still much smaller than other models based on partial

large GPU clusters to train DNNs is becoming an essential requirement to
achieving acceptable training times. In this paper, we consider the case where
future increases in cluster size will cause the global batch size that can be
used to train models to reach a fundamental limit: beyond a certain point,
larger global batch sizes cause sample efficiency to degrade, increasing
overall time to accuracy. As a result, to achieve further improvements in
training performance, we must instead consider ""strong scaling"" strategies that
hold the global batch size constant and allocate smaller batches to each GPU.
Unfortunately, this makes it significantly more difficult to use cluster
resources efficiently. We present DeepPool, a system that addresses this
efficiency challenge through two key ideas. First, burst parallelism allocates
large numbers of GPUs to foreground jobs in bursts to exploit the unevenness in
parallelism across layers. Second, GPU multiplexing prioritizes throughput for
foreground training jobs, while packing in background training jobs to reclaim
underutilized GPU resources, thereby improving cluster-wide utilization.
Together, these two ideas enable DeepPool to deliver a 1.2 - 2.3x improvement
in total cluster throughput over standard data parallelism with a single task

necessary for downstream applications. EC tools need to be manually configured
for optimal performance. We find that the optimal parameters (e.g., k-mer size)
are both tool- and dataset-dependent. Moreover, evaluating the performance
(i.e., Alignment-rate or Gain) of a given tool usually relies on a reference
genome, but quality reference genomes are not always available. We introduce
Lerna for the automated configuration of k-mer-based EC tools. Lerna first
creates a language model (LM) of the uncorrected genomic reads; then,
calculates the perplexity metric to evaluate the corrected reads for different
parameter choices. Next, it finds the one that produces the highest alignment
rate without using a reference genome. The fundamental intuition of our
approach is that the perplexity metric is inversely correlated with the quality
of the assembly after error correction. Results: First, we show that the best
k-mer value can vary for different datasets, even for the same EC tool. Second,
we show the gains of our LM using its component attention-based transformers.
We show the model's estimation of the perplexity metric before and after error
correction. The lower the perplexity after correction, the better the k-mer
size. We also show that the alignment rate and assembly quality computed for
the corrected reads are strongly negatively correlated with the perplexity,
enabling the automated selection of k-mer values for better error correction,
and hence, improved assembly quality. Additionally, we show that our
attention-based models have significant runtime improvement for the entire
pipeline -- 18X faster than previous works, due to parallelizing the attention
mechanism and the use of JIT compilation for GPU inferencing.

types, including flat, overlapped (aka. nested), and discontinuous NER, which
have mostly been studied individually. Recently, a growing interest has been
built for unified NER, tackling the above three jobs concurrently with one
single model. Current best-performing methods mainly include span-based and
sequence-to-sequence models, where unfortunately the former merely focus on
boundary identification and the latter may suffer from exposure bias. In this
work, we present a novel alternative by modeling the unified NER as word-word
relation classification, namely W^2NER. The architecture resolves the kernel
bottleneck of unified NER by effectively modeling the neighboring relations
between entity words with Next-Neighboring-Word (NNW) and Tail-Head-Word-*
(THW-*) relations. Based on the W^2NER scheme we develop a neural framework, in
which the unified NER is modeled as a 2D grid of word pairs. We then propose
multi-granularity 2D convolutions for better refining the grid representations.
Finally, a co-predictor is used to sufficiently reason the word-word relations.
We perform extensive experiments on 14 widely-used benchmark datasets for flat,
overlapped, and discontinuous NER (8 English and 6 Chinese datasets), where our
model beats all the current top-performing baselines, pushing the

images and videos, are produced in our daily work and life. These visual data
are not only used for human viewing or understanding but also for machine
analysis or decision-making, e.g., intelligent surveillance, automated
vehicles, and many other smart city applications. To this end, a new image
codec paradigm for both human and machine uses is proposed in this work.
Firstly, the high-level instance segmentation map and the low-level signal
features are extracted with neural networks. Then, the instance segmentation
map is further represented as a profile with the proposed 16-bit gray-scale
representation. After that, both 16-bit gray-scale profile and signal features
are encoded with a lossless codec. Meanwhile, an image predictor is designed
and trained to achieve the general-quality image reconstruction with the 16-bit
gray-scale profile and signal features. Finally, the residual map between the
original image and the predicted one is compressed with a lossy codec, used for
high-quality image reconstruction. With such designs, on the one hand, we can
achieve scalable image compression to meet the requirements of different human
consumption; on the other hand, we can directly achieve several machine vision
tasks at the decoder side with the decoded 16-bit gray-scale profile, e.g.,
object classification, detection, and segmentation. Experimental results show
that the proposed codec achieves comparable results as most learning-based
codecs and outperforms the traditional codecs (e.g., BPG and JPEG2000) in terms
of PSNR and MS-SSIM for image reconstruction. At the same time, it outperforms
the existing codecs in terms of the mAP for object detection and segmentation.

various medical imaging benchmarking challenges, including the Brain Tumor

multi-compartment segmentation (e.g., tumor and lesion sub-regions) is
particularly challenging, and potential errors hinder translating DL models
into clinical workflows. Quantifying the reliability of DL model predictions in
the form of uncertainties could enable clinical review of the most uncertain
regions, thereby building trust and paving the way toward clinical translation.
Several uncertainty estimation methods have recently been introduced for DL
medical image segmentation tasks. Developing scores to evaluate and compare the
performance of uncertainty measures will assist the end-user in making more
informed decisions. In this study, we explore and evaluate a score developed
during the BraTS 2019 and BraTS 2020 task on uncertainty quantification
(QU-BraTS) and designed to assess and rank uncertainty estimates for brain
tumor multi-compartment segmentation. This score (1) rewards uncertainty
estimates that produce high confidence in correct assertions and those that
assign low confidence levels at incorrect assertions, and (2) penalizes
uncertainty measures that lead to a higher percentage of under-confident
correct assertions. We further benchmark the segmentation uncertainties
generated by 14 independent participating teams of QU-BraTS 2020, all of which
also participated in the main BraTS segmentation task. Overall, our findings
confirm the importance and complementary value that uncertainty estimates
provide to segmentation algorithms, highlighting the need for uncertainty

local, and consistency constraint sets of the nominal subsystems. In the

neighborhood sets are assumed to be known in prior. In the second and third
cases, both of them are supposed to be unknown in prior. The simulation results
show that the input and state constraints are satisfied by the proposed DSwMPC
at all times. They also validate that the closed-loop system converges to the
origin. Also, a comparison of the DSwMPC with a centralized SwMPC (CSwMPC) and
a decentralized SwMPC (DeSwMPC) shows that the DSwMPC outperforms the DecSwMPC

between the distribution of training data and the data that actually needs to
be predicted is likely to cause poor model performance. However, most of the
current studies do not take this into account, and they directly mix data from
different time periods when training the models. This brings about two
problems. Firstly, there is a risk of data leakage, i.e., using future data to
predict the past. This can result in inflated results in offline validation,
but unsatisfactory results in practical applications. Secondly, the
macroeconomic environment and risk control strategies are likely to be
different in different time periods, and the behavior patterns of borrowers may
also change. The model trained with past data may not be applicable to the
recent stage. Therefore, we propose a method based on adversarial validation to
alleviate the dataset shift problem in credit scoring scenarios. In this
method, partial training set samples with the closest distribution to the
predicted data are selected for cross-validation by adversarial validation to
ensure the generalization performance of the trained model on the predicted
samples. In addition, through a simple splicing method, samples in the training
data that are inconsistent with the test data distribution are also involved in
the training process of cross-validation, which makes full use of all the data
and further improves the model performance. To verify the effectiveness of the

from observations of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) at the dual
$S/X$-band (2.3/8.4~GHz) between August 1979 and December 2020. We measured the

(i) we estimate the global spin of the ICRF3 axes based on the apparent proper
motion (slope of the position time series) of the ICRF3 defining sources; (ii)
we also construct the yearly representations of the ICRF3 through annually
averaged positions of the ICRF3 defining sources and estimate the dispersion in
the axis orientation of these yearly frames. The global spin is no higher than
$\mathrm{0.8\,\mu as\,yr^{-1}}$ for each ICRF3 axis with an uncertainty of
$\mathrm{0.3\,\mu as\,yr^{-1}}$, corresponding to an accumulated deformation
smaller than $\mathrm{30\,\mu as}$ for the celestial frame axes during

first-principles calculations. For the SHG at zero frequency limit of both

the intensities of interlayer optical transitions (IOT), the increased band

the tint, the smaller the SHG response. For the SHG spectra of $MoS_2/MoSe_2$
in the low photon-energy region, opposite to the $MoS_2/MoS_2$, their peak
values are very sensitive to the variable tint, due to the strong
$t_{int}$-dependent IOT dominating in the band edge; the larger the tint, the
larger the SHG. For the SHG of $MoS_2/MoS_2$ in the high photon-energy region,
comparing to the $MoS_2/MoSe_2$, their peak values will decrease in a much more
noticeable way as the $t_{int}$ increases, due to the larger reduction of band

experimental observations for the different SHG responses in different bilayer

modern society. While recent years have witnessed many promising news
recommendation models, they mostly capture the user-news interactions on the

can be quite complex and diverse, blindly squeezing all the contents into an
embedding vector can be less effective in extracting information compatible
with the personalized preference of the users. In addition, user preferences in
the news recommendation scenario can be highly dynamic, and a tailored dynamic

paper, we propose a novel dynamic news recommender model. For better
understanding the news content, we leverage the attention mechanism to

respectively. For capturing users' dynamic preferences, the continuous time
information is seamlessly incorporated into the computing of the attention
weights. More specifically, we design a hierarchical attention network, where
the lower layer learns the importance of different sentences and elements, and
the upper layer captures the correlations between the previously interacted and

enhance the traditional attention mechanism by incorporating both absolute and

random access phase is device activity detection, which is to detect the active
devices from a large number of potential devices based on the received signal
at the access point. By utilizing the statistical properties of the channel,
state-of-the-art covariance based methods have been demonstrated to achieve
better activity detection performance than compressed sensing based methods.
However, covariance based methods require to solve a high dimensional nonconvex
optimization problem by updating the estimate of the activity status of each
device sequentially. Since the number of updates is proportional to the device
number, the computational complexity and delay make the iterative updates
difficult for real-time implementation especially when the device number scales
up. Inspired by the success of deep learning for real-time inference, this
paper proposes a learning based method with a customized heterogeneous

attention mechanism in the architecture design, the proposed method is able to
extract the relevance between device pilots and received signal, is permutation

  Localization","Accepted by Pattern recognition",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In facial landmark localization tasks, various occlusions heavily degrade the
localization accuracy due to the partial observability of facial features. This
paper proposes a structural relation network (SRN) for occlusion-robust
landmark localization. Unlike most existing methods that simply exploit the
shape constraint, the proposed SRN aims to capture the structural relations
among different facial components. These relations can be considered a more
powerful shape constraint against occlusion. To achieve this, a hierarchical
structural relation module (HSRM) is designed to hierarchically reason the
structural relations that represent both long- and short-distance spatial
dependencies. Compared with existing network architectures, HSRM can
efficiently model the spatial relations by leveraging its geometry-aware
network architecture, which reduces the semantic ambiguity caused by occlusion.
Moreover, the SRN augments the training data by synthesizing occluded faces. To
further extend our SRN for occluded video data, we formulate the occluded face
synthesis as a Markov decision process (MDP). Specifically, it plans the
movement of the dynamic occlusion based on an accumulated reward associated
with the performance degradation of the pre-trained SRN. This procedure
augments hard samples for robust facial landmark tracking. Extensive
experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves outstanding
performance on occluded and masked faces. Code is available at

presented and discussed, as a function of the electron- and hole-doping content
as well as applied pressure. The study was performed within the density
functional perturbation theory, taking into account the effects of zero-point

implemented by means of the construction of the Sc$_{1-x}$M$_{x}$H$_{3}$

properties under hole-doping (M=Ca,Sr) and at pressure values close to
dynamical instabilities. Instead, by electron-doping (M=Ti,Zr), the systems do
not improve such properties, whatever value of applied pressure is considered.
Then, as a result, $T_c$ rapidly increases as a function of $x$ on the
hole-doping region, reaching its maximum value of $92.7(67.9)$~K and
$84.5(60.2)$~K at $x=0.3$ for Sc$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$H$_{3}$ at $10.8$~GPa and

while for both, electron- and hole-doping, $T_c$ decreases as a function of the

potential impact on the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus as well
as the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Here, we predict the mutability
of all positions in SARS-CoV-2 protein domains to forecast the appearance of
unseen variants. Using sequence data from other coronaviruses, pre-existing to
SARS-CoV-2, we build statistical models that do not only capture amino-acid
conservation but more complex patterns resulting from epistasis. We show that
these models are notably superior to conservation profiles in estimating the
already observable SARS-CoV-2 variability. In the receptor binding domain of
the spike protein, we observe that the predicted mutability correlates well
with experimental measures of protein stability and that both are reliable
mutability predictors (ROC AUC ~0.8). Most interestingly, we observe an
increasing agreement between our model and the observed variability as more
data become available over time, proving the anticipatory capacity of our
model. When combined with data concerning the immune response, our approach
identifies positions where current variants of concern are highly
overrepresented. These results could assist studies on viral evolution, future
viral outbreaks and, in particular, guide the exploration and anticipation of
potentially harmful future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

in computational geometry. These lower bounds hold in the Word-RAM model,
conditioned on the hardness of either 3SUM, APSP, or the Online Matrix-Vector
Multiplication problem [Henzinger et al., STOC 2015]. In particular we get
lower bounds in the incremental and fully-dynamic settings for counting maximal
or extremal points in R^3, different variants of Klee's Measure Problem,
problems related to finding the largest empty disk in a set of points, and
querying the size of the i'th convex layer in a planar set of points. We also
answer a question of Chan et al. [SODA 2022] by giving a conditional lower
bound for dynamic approximate square set cover. While many conditional lower
bounds for dynamic data structures have been proven since the seminal work of
Patrascu [STOC 2010], few of them relate to computational geometry problems.
This is the first paper focusing on this topic. Most problems we consider can
be solved in O(n log n) time in the static case and their dynamic versions have
only been approached from the perspective of improving known upper bounds. One
exception to this is Klee's measure problem in R^2, for which Chan [CGTA 2010]
gave an unconditional ${\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound on the worst-case update

important special case of Klee's measure problem in R^3 known as the

facial manipulation has achieved significant progress in both academia and
industry recently. It inspires an increasing number of entertainment
applications but also incurs severe threats to individual privacy and even
political security meanwhile. To mitigate such risks, many countermeasures have
been proposed. However, the great majority methods are designed in a passive
manner, which is to detect whether the facial images or videos are tampered
after their wide propagation. These detection-based methods have a fatal
limitation, that is, they only work for ex-post forensics but can not prevent
the engendering of malicious behavior. To address the limitation, in this
paper, we propose a novel framework of initiative defense to degrade the
performance of facial manipulation models controlled by malicious users. The
basic idea is to actively inject imperceptible venom into target facial data
before manipulation. To this end, we first imitate the target manipulation
model with a surrogate model, and then devise a poison perturbation generator
to obtain the desired venom. An alternating training strategy are further
leveraged to train both the surrogate model and the perturbation generator. Two
typical facial manipulation tasks: face attribute editing and face reenactment,
are considered in our initiative defense framework. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework in different
settings. Finally, we hope this work can shed some light on initiative
countermeasures against more adversarial scenarios.

faithfully demonstrated by the calculations of the optical responses from gold

vulnerabilities in any application. Fuzzers are fast enough, but they still
spend a good portion of time to restart a crashed application and then fuzz it
from the beginning. Fuzzing an application from a point deeper in the execution
is also important. To do this, a user needs to take a snapshot of the program
while fuzzing it on top of an emulator, virtual machine, or by utilizing a
special kernel module to enable checkpointing. Even with this ability, it can
be difficult to attach a fuzzer after restoring a checkpoint. As a result, most
fuzzers leverage a form of fork-server design.
  We propose a novel testing architecture that allows users to attach a fuzzer
after the program has started running. We do this by natively checkpointing the
target application at a point of interest, and attaching the fuzzer after
restoring the checkpoint. A fork-server may even be engaged at the point of
restoration. This not only improves the throughput of the fuzzing campaign by
minimizing startup time, but opens up a new way to fuzz applications. With this
architecture, a user can take a series of checkpoints at points of interest,
and run parallel tests to reduce the overall state-complexity of an individual
test. Checkpoints allow us to begin fuzzing from a deeper point in the
execution path, omitting prior execution from the required coverage path. This
and other checkpointing techniques are described in the paper to help improve
fuzzing.

both whole-body dynamics and dexterous finger movements. To this end, we
propose SAGA (StochAstic whole-body Grasping with contAct), a framework which
consists of two key components: (a) Static whole-body grasping pose generation.
Specifically, we propose a multi-task generative model, to jointly learn static
whole-body grasping poses and human-object contacts. (b) Grasping motion
infilling. Given an initial pose and the generated whole-body grasping pose as
the start and end of the motion respectively, we design a novel contact-aware
generative motion infilling module to generate a diverse set of grasp-oriented

properties in glasses and has been found to be almost depleted in ultrastable
glasses. While this depletion of TLS is thought to have a close relationship
with the dramatic decrease of quasi-localized modes (QLMs), it has yet to be
clearly formalized. In this work, we argue, based on the
\textit{soft-potential} model, that TLS correspond to QLMs with typical
frequency $\omega_0$. The density $n_0$ of TLS is proportional to both the
density of QLMs $D_L(\omega_0)$, and the fraction of symmetric double-wells
$f(\omega_0)$ at $\omega_0$, i.e., $n_0 \propto D_L(\omega_0)f(\omega_0)$. We
numerically estimate $\omega_0$ and $n_0$ in computer glasses at different
levels of stabilities, and find that $\omega_0$ is about $5\%$ to $10\%$ of the
Debye frequency. $n_0$ in ultrastable glasses is over $1000$ times smaller than
that in poorly prepared glasses, with both $D_L(\omega_0)$ and $f(\omega_0)$
decreasing significantly. Remarkably, the order of magnitude of estimations for
$n_0$ agrees with that found in experiments in amorphous silicon. Our study
paves the way to understanding the depletion of TLS through the rarefaction of
QLMs.

of magnitude lower than the expected precision of 10^-9 set by photon-photon

that for a near-resonant chain of three planets, where the two super-periods
are close to each other, the TTVs of the pair-wise interactions cannot be

Depending on the maximal order of expansion terms kept, AnalyticLC computation
time can be up to an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art published

advantage increases for long-term observations as our approach's computation

system costs. However, managed Hadoop systems do present a black-box behavior
to the end-users who cannot be clear on the inner performance dynamics, hence,
on the benefits of leveraging them. In the study, we aimed to understand
managed Hadoop context in terms of resource utilization. We utilized three
experimental Hadoop-on-PaaS proposals as they come out-of-the-box and conducted
Hadoop specific workloads of the HiBench Benchmark Suite. During the benchmark
executions, we collected system resource utilization data on the worker nodes.
The results indicated that the same property specifications among cloud
services do not guarantee nearby performance outputs, nor consistent results
within themselves. We assume that the managed systems' architectures and
pre-configurations play a significant role in the performance.

  Organic Frameworks: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sorption of gases in micro- and mesoporous materials is typically interpreted
on the basis of idealized structural models where real structure effects such
as defects and disorder are absent. For covalent organic frameworks (COFs)
significant discrepancies between measured and simulated adsorption isotherms
are often reported but rarely traced back to their origins. This is because
little is known about the real structure of COFs and its effect on the sorption
properties of these materials. In the present work molecular simulations are
used to obtain adsorption isotherms of argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in
the COF-LZU1 at various temperatures. The (perfect) model COF has a BET surface
that is higher than the experimental BET surface by a factor of approximately
1.33, suggesting defects or inclusions are present in the real structure. We
find that the saturation adsorption loading of small gaseous species in
COF-LZU1, as determined from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, is also
higher by approximately the same factor compared to the experimental saturation
loading. The influence of interlayer slipping on the shape of the adsorption
isotherm and the adsorption capacity is studied. Comparison between simulation
and experiment at lower loadings suggests the layers to be shifted instead of
perfectly eclipsed. The sensitivity of the adsorption isotherms in this regime
towards the underlying framework topology shows that real structure effects
have significant influence on the gas uptake. Accounting for layer slipping is
important to applications such as catalysis, gas storage and separation.

organisation of traditional systemic trading from quote-driven markets into
order-driven markets. Its convenience led to an exponentially increasing amount
of financial data, which is however hard to use for the prediction of future
prices, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the non-stationarity of
financial time series. Simpler classification tasks -- where the goal is to
predict the directions of future price movement -- via supervised learning
algorithms, need sufficiently reliable labels to generalise well. Labelling
financial data is however less well defined than other domains: did the price
go up because of noise or because of signal? The existing labelling methods
have limited countermeasures against noise and limited effects in improving
learning algorithms. This work takes inspiration from image classification in
trading and success in self-supervised learning. We investigate the idea of
applying computer vision techniques to financial time-series to reduce the
noise exposure and hence generate correct labels. We look at the label
generation as the pretext task of a self-supervised learning approach and
compare the naive (and noisy) labels, commonly used in the literature, with the
labels generated by a denoising autoencoder for the same downstream
classification task. Our results show that our denoised labels improve the
performances of the downstream learning algorithm, for both small and large
datasets. We further show that the signals we obtain can be used to effectively
trade with binary strategies. We suggest that with proposed techniques,
self-supervised learning constitutes a powerful framework for generating
""better"" financial labels that are useful for studying the underlying patterns

[15] has been recently extended by Mao and Cai [29] to cumulative prospect
theory (CPT) based SR in order to better capture a decision maker's
utility/risk preference. In this paper, we consider a situation where
information on the value function and/or the weighting functions in the CPT
based SR is incomplete. Instead of using partially available information to
construct an approximate value function and weighting functions, we propose a
robust approach to define a generalized shortfall risk which is based on a
tuple of the worst case value/weighting functions from ambiguity sets of
plausible value/weighting functions identified via available information. The
ambiguity set may be constructed with elicited preference information (e.g.
pairwise comparison questionnaires) and subjective judgement, and the ambiguity
reduces as more and more preference information is obtained. Under some
moderate conditions, we demonstrate how the subproblem of the robust shortfall
risk measure can be calculated by solving a linear programming problem. To
examine the performance of the proposed robust model and computational scheme,
we carry out some numerical experiments and report preliminary test results.
This work may be viewed as an extension of recent research of preference robust
optimization models to the CPT based SR.

from the grand partition function. However, if the Z3 center symmetry, which is
important for understanding the finite temperature phase transition of SU(3)

dependence structure underlying this dimension-reduction principle, provide a

For that purpose, we define a bivariate copula capturing the scale-invariant
extent of dependence of an endogenous random variable $Y$ on a set of $d \geq
1$ exogenous random variables ${\bf X} = (X_1, \dots, X_d)$, and containing the
information whether $Y$ is completely dependent on ${\bf X}$, and whether $Y$

apparent insofar as the introduced bivariate copula can be viewed as the
distribution function of two random variables $Y$ and $Y^\prime$ sharing the
same conditional distribution and being conditionally independent given ${\bf
X}$. Evaluating this copula uniformly along the diagonal, i.e. calculating
Spearman's footrule, leads to Azadkia and Chatterjee's `simple measure of

a coherence approach based on the wave nature of quantum mechanics to
understand the mysterious quantum feature of nonlocal fringes. For this, a

for both local and nonlocal correlations, where the local intensities are due
to many-wave interference between measured photos. For the nonlocal fringe,
however, coincidence detection results in selective measurements, resulting in
second-order amplitude superposition between locally measured photon basis
products. Due to the intrinsic property of a fixed sum-phase relation between
entangled photons in each pair, the joint-phase relation of the nonlocal fringe
is immune to the random spectral detuning of photon pairs. As in the

data released via jittering (Karwa, Krivitsky and Slavkovi\'c, 2017). Unlike
most previous approaches based on maximum likelihood estimation for this

exploration of a substantially broader range of privacy levels -- corresponding
to stricter privacy -- than has been to date. Over this new range we discover
our proposed estimator for the parameters exhibits an interesting phase

one of three different regimes of behavior depending on the level of privacy.
Because identification of the operable regime is difficult to impossible in

knowledge learned from the source domain with the data in the target domain to
cluster the target data. Subsequently, an alternate optimization scheme is
developed to solve the constraint objective function of the TECM algorithm. The
proposed TECM algorithm is applicable to cases where the source and target

signal by the selective auditory attention, however, such functionality was
hardly ever explored in machine hearing. This paper addresses the target sound
detection (TSD) task, which aims to detect the target sound signal from a
mixture audio when a target sound's reference audio is given. We present a
novel target sound detection network (TSDNet) which consists of two main parts:
A conditional network which aims at generating a sound-discriminative
conditional embedding vector representing the target sound, and a detection
network which takes both the mixture audio and the conditional embedding vector
as inputs and produces the detection result of the target sound. These two
networks can be jointly optimized with a multi-task learning approach to
further improve the performance. In addition, we study both strong-supervised
and weakly-supervised strategies to train TSDNet and propose a data
augmentation method by mixing two samples. To facilitate this research, we
build a target sound detection dataset (\textit{i.e.} URBAN-TSD) based on
URBAN-SED and UrbanSound8K datasets, and experimental results indicate our

social networks led to enormous research activity to develop methods that can
extract meaningful information from interaction data. Commonly, interactions
are represented by edges in a network or a graph, which implicitly assumes that
the interactions are pairwise and static. However, real-world interactions
deviate from these assumptions: (i) interactions can be multi-way, involving
more than two nodes or individuals (e.g., family relationships, protein
interactions), and (ii) interactions can change over a period of time (e.g.,
change of opinions and friendship status). While pairwise interactions have
been studied in a dynamic network setting and multi-way interactions have been
studied using hypergraphs in static networks, there exists no method, at
present, that can predict multi-way interactions or hyperedges in dynamic
settings. Existing related methods cannot answer temporal queries like what
type of interaction will occur next and when it will occur. This paper proposes
a temporal point process model for hyperedge prediction to address these
problems. Our proposed model uses dynamic representation learning techniques
for nodes in a neural point process framework to forecast hyperedges. We
present several experimental results and set benchmark results. As far as our
knowledge, this is the first work that uses the temporal point process to
forecast hyperedges in dynamic networks.

explored in part. Furthermore, it needs to refer to the ground plane, where
also the driving actions are taken. This paper aims at extracting the local
road network topology, directly in the bird's-eye-view (BEV), all in a complex
urban setting. The only input consists of a single onboard, forward looking
camera image. We represent the road topology using a set of directed lane
curves and their interactions, which are captured using their intersection
points. To better capture topology, we introduce the concept of \emph{minimal
cycles} and their covers. A minimal cycle is the smallest cycle formed by the
directed curve segments (between two intersections). The cover is a set of
curves whose segments are involved in forming a minimal cycle. We first show
that the covers suffice to uniquely represent the road topology. The covers are
then used to supervise deep neural networks, along with the lane curve
supervision. These learn to predict the road topology from a single input
image. The results on the NuScenes and Argoverse benchmarks are significantly
better than those obtained with baselines. Code:

the same probability distribution. However, this fundamental assumption is not
always satisfied in practice, e.g., due to changing environments, sample
selection bias, privacy concerns, or high labeling costs. Transfer learning
(TL) relaxes this assumption and allows us to learn under distribution shift.
Classical TL methods typically rely on importance-weighting -- a predictor is
trained based on the training losses weighted according to the importance
(i.e., the test-over-training density ratio). However, as real-world machine
learning tasks are becoming increasingly complex, high-dimensional, and
dynamical, novel approaches are explored to cope with such challenges recently.
In this article, after introducing the foundation of TL based on

recent works on face-based age estimation employ these networks as the

equally, thus entirely ignoring the importance of some facial patches that may
contain rich age-specific information. In this paper, we propose a face-based
age estimation framework, called Attention-based Dynamic Patch Fusion (ADPF).
In ADPF, two separate CNNs are implemented, namely the AttentionNet and the
FusionNet. The AttentionNet dynamically locates and ranks age-specific patches
by employing a novel Ranking-guided Multi-Head Hybrid Attention (RMHHA)
mechanism. The FusionNet uses the discovered patches along with the facial
image to predict the age of the subject. Since the proposed RMHHA mechanism
ranks the discovered patches based on their importance, the length of the
learning path of each patch in the FusionNet is proportional to the amount of
information it carries (the longer, the more important). ADPF also introduces a
novel diversity loss to guide the training of the AttentionNet and reduce the
overlap among patches so that the diverse and important patches are discovered.
Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on several age estimation benchmark datasets.

pre-training regimes that boost various low-level tasks. To comprehensively
diagnose the influence of pre-training, we design a whole set of principled

observations demonstrate that pre-training plays strikingly different roles in
low-level tasks. For example, pre-training introduces more local information to
higher layers in super-resolution (SR), yielding significant performance gains,
while pre-training hardly affects internal feature representations in
denoising, resulting in limited gains. Further, we explore different methods of
pre-training, revealing that multi-related-task pre-training is more effective
and data-efficient than other alternatives. Finally, we extend our study to
varying data scales and model sizes, as well as comparisons between

rely on hBN crystals isotopically enriched with either $^{10}$B or $^{11}$B to
investigate the isotope-dependent properties of a spin defect featuring a
broadband photoluminescence signal in the near infrared. By analyzing the
hyperfine structure of the spin defect while changing the boron isotope, we
first unambiguously confirm that it corresponds to the negatively-charged
boron-vacancy center (${\rm V}_{\rm B}^-$). We then show that its spin
coherence properties are slightly improved in $^{10}$B-enriched samples. This
is supported by numerical simulations employing cluster correlation expansion
methods, which reveal the importance of the hyperfine Fermi contact term for
calculating the coherence time of point defects in hBN. Using cross-relaxation

additional source of decoherence. This work provides new insights into the
properties of ${\rm V}_{\rm B}^-$ spin defects, which are valuable for the
future development of hBN-based quantum sensing foils.

Technology, they are highly prone to cyber-attacks. With time more advanced and

Therefore, for having an autonomous and reliable operation of unmanned aerial

  Approach",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the advent of intelligent jammers, jamming attacks have become a more
severe threat to the performance of wireless systems. An intelligent jammer is
able to change its policy to minimize the probability of being traced by
legitimate nodes. Thus, an anti-jamming mechanism capable of constantly
adjusting to the jamming policy is required to combat such a jammer.
Remarkably, existing anti-jamming methods are not applicable here because they
mainly focus on mitigating jamming attacks with an invariant jamming policy,
and they rarely consider an intelligent jammer as an adversary. Therefore, in
this paper, to employ a jamming type recognition technique working alongside an
anti-jamming technique is proposed. The proposed recognition method employs a
recurrent neural network that takes the jammer's occupied channels as inputs
and outputs the jammer type. Under this scheme, the real-time jammer policy is
first identified, and, then, the most appropriate countermeasure is chosen.
Consequently, any changes to the jammer policy can be instantly detected with
the proposed recognition technique allowing for a rapid switch to a new
anti-jamming method fitted to the new jamming policy. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed recognition method, the accuracy of the detection
is derived as a function of the jammer policy switching time. Simulation
results show the detection accuracy for all the considered users numbers is
greater than 70% when the jammer switches its policy every 5 time slots and the
accuracy raises to 90% when the jammer policy switching time is 45.

We study decaying acoustic turbulence using numerical simulations of a
relativistic fluid in two dimensions. Working in the limit of non-relativistic
bulk velocities, with an ultra-relativistic equation of state, we find that the
energy spectrum evolves towards a self-similar broken power law, with a
high-wavenumber behaviour of $k^{-2.08 \pm 0.08}$, cut off at very high $k$ by
the inverse width of the shock waves. Our model for the decay of acoustic
turbulence can be extended to three dimensions using the universality of the
high-$k$ power law and the evolution laws for the kinetic energy and the
integral length scale. It is used to build an estimate for the gravitational
wave power spectrum resulting from a collection of shock waves, as might be
found in the aftermath of a strong first order phase transition in the early
universe. The power spectrum has a peak wavenumber set by the initial length
scale of the acoustic waves, and a new secondary scale at a lower wavenumber
set by the integral scale after a Hubble time. Between these scales a
distinctive new power law appears. Our results allow more accurate predictions
of the gravitational wave power spectrum for a wide range of early universe
phase transition scenarios.

for the realization of a broad range of novel magnonic devices. Here we study
experimentally the spin wave resonance in thick ferromagnetic rings (100 nm)
using perpendicular ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Different from what
was observed for the continuous film of the same thickness, or from ring with
similar lateral dimensions but with lower thicknesses, the spectra of thick
patterned rings show a non-monotonic dependence of the mode intensity on the
resonance field for a fixed frequency. To explain this effect, the theoretical
approach by considering the dependence of the mode profiles on both the radial
and axial coordinates was developed. It was demonstrated that such unusual
behavior is a result of the competition between exchange and dipolar fields
acting at the spin excitations in the structure under study. The calculations
are in a good agreement with the experimental results.

systems with a continuous translation symmetry may have an ill-defined
topology. The topological classification of such systems is only feasible when
the material response is regularized with a spatial-frequency cutoff. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate that inserting a small air gap in between two
materials may effectively imitate an idealized spatial cutoff that suppresses
the nonreciprocal response for short wavelengths and regularizes the topology.
Furthermore, it is experimentally verified that nonreciprocal systems with an
ill-defined topology may be used to abruptly halt the energy flow in a
unidirectional waveguide due to the violation of the bulk-edge correspondence.
In particular, we report the formation of an energy sink that absorbs the
incoming electromagnetic waves with a large field enhancement at the
singularity.

well-calibrated and synchronized, and their data were recorded simultaneously.
The ground truth trajectories were obtained by the motion capture device, a
laser 3D tracker, and an RTK receiver. The dataset comprises 36 sequences

  lithium niobate-chalcogenide hybrid waveguides",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A highly efficient on-chip acousto-optic modulator, as a key component,
occupies an exceptional position in microwave-to-optical conversion.
Homogeneous thin-film lithium niobate is preferentially employed to build the
suspended configuration forming the acoustic resonant cavity to improve the
modulation efficiency of the device. However, the limited cavity length and
complex fabrication recipe of the suspended prototype restrain further
breakthrough in the modulation efficiency and impose challenges for waveguide
fabrication. In this work, based on a nonsuspended thin-film lithium
niobate-chalcogenide glass hybrid Mach-Zehnder interferometer waveguide
platform, we propose and demonstrate a built-in push-pull acousto-optic
modulator with a half-wave-voltage-length product as low as 0.03 V cm,
presenting a modulation efficiency comparable to that of the state-of-the-art
suspended counterpart. Based on the advantage of low power consumption, a
microwave modulation link is demonstrated using our developed built-in
push-pull acousto-optic modulator. The nontrivial acousto-optic modulation
performance benefits from the superior photoelastic property of the
chalcogenide membrane and the completely bidirectional participation of the
antisymmetric Rayleigh surface acoustic wave mode excited by the
impedance-matched interdigital transducer, overcoming the issue of amplitude
differences of surface acoustic waves applied to the Mach-Zehnder
interferometer two arms in traditional push-pull acousto-optic modulators.

condition is imposed on one boundary and a third type (Robin) condition is
considered at the other one. The parameter is estimated by minimizing the
squared errors where noisy observations are numerically simulated at different
positions and instants. The results are evaluated by means of the relative
errors for different levels of noise. In order to enhance the estimation
performance, an optimal design technique is chosen to select the most

  Graph Enhanced Multiview Graph Convolution","SIGIR 2021",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) readmission rate is an important metric
for evaluating the quality of hospital care. Efficient and accurate prediction
of ICU readmission risk can not only help prevent patients from inappropriate
discharge and potential dangers, but also reduce associated costs of
healthcare. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses medical text of
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for prediction, which provides an alternative
perspective to previous studies that heavily depend on numerical and
time-series features of patients. More specifically, we extract discharge
summaries of patients from their EHRs, and represent them with multiview graphs
enhanced by an external knowledge graph. Graph convolutional networks are then
used for representation learning. Experimental results prove the effectiveness
of our method, yielding state-of-the-art performance for this task.

blocking was assessed in $>$ 200 boundaries and was related with geometrical
criteria that establish the alignment between the active slip systems across
the boundaries. It was found that slip transfer mainly occurs at low-angle
regular grain boundaries and that a Luster-Morris parameter $>$ 0.8 stands for
the best criterion to assess slip transfer. In the case of coherent or
incoherent twin boundaries, slip transfer occurs when the residual Burgers
vector is close to zero through dislocation cross-slip.

uncertainty relation for arbitrary two operators. Consideration is made in
spherical coordinates, where the distant variable is restricted from one side,
. By this reason accounting of suitable boundary condition at the origin for
radial wave functions and operators is necessary. Therefore, there arise extra
surface terms in comparison with traditional approaches. These extra terms are
calculated for various solvable potentials and their influence is investigated.
At last, the time-energy uncertainty relations are also analysed. Some
differences between our approach and that, in which a direct product for
separate variances were considered are discussed.
