nonlinear $U(1)$ gauge-invariant modifications of Maxwell's classical
electrodynamics (also known as BI-type nonlinear electrodynamics) and bring
some new perspectives on these theories. First, within the framework of
exponential $U(1)$ gauge theory, it is explicitly proved that although the
electric field at the location of the elementary point charges is not finite,
but the total electrostatic field energy is finite. Motivated by this
observation together with a wealth of evidence, we conjecture that all theories
in 4-dimensional spacetime that belong to the BI family result in finite
self-energy for elementary charged particles. In higher dimensions, it is found
that the weak-field coupling limit of BI-type theories, which is identified as
the weak field limit of effective Euler-Heisenberg (EH) theory, does not
possess a regularizing ability to make the self-energy of a point charge
finite, which implies that the conjecture may not hold for some BI-type
theories. However, we explicitly prove that BI, logarithmic and exponential
$U(1)$ gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions result in finite self-energy as
well. Next, we classically study the problem of vacuum polarization effects and
then systematically make a connection between all BI-type theories and QED. It
is shown that all the BI-type theories classically predict the vacuum
polarization effects, in which the final results are exactly in one-to-one
correspondence with QED and the effective EH theory up to the leading order of
corrections. Finally, we present a new, simple proof indicating that ...

Galactic plane, and they both have prograde motions with only a small
difference in their velocities (Collinder 350 moves ~5 km/s faster than IC
4665); as inferred from ESA/Gaia based catalogue. Interestingly, the two
clusters are physically separated by only 36 pc in space; a distance that is
smaller than the sum of their respective radii. Furthermore, the clusters
exhibit signatures of elongated stellar density distributions, and we also
detect an onset of an inter-cluster stellar bridge. Moreover, the orbit
analysis suggests that the younger cluster IC 4665 (age=53 Myr) must have
formed at a distance > 500 pc away from Collinder 350 (age=617 Myr). These

objects in a binary system, rather, what we are witnessing is an actual
collision between two independently formed star clusters. This collision
phenomenon provides a unique opportunity to explore new aspects of formation

The aim is to minimize the used space depending on the specific problem at

  We draw interesting connections to the following online sorting problem
\OnlineSorting{}$[\gamma,n]$: We receive a stream of real numbers
$s_1,\ldots,s_n$, $s_i\in[0,1]$, one by one. Each real must be placed in an

at most $1$. We show that for any $\Delta$-competitive online algorithm of

  We use this lower bound to prove the non-existence of competitive algorithms

them strip packing, bin packing and perimeter packing. This also implies that
there exists no online algorithm that can pack all streams of pieces of

performance and the rate adaptivity of optical communication systems. In
principle, it could also be used to mitigate the impact of nonlinear effects,
possibly increasing the information rate beyond the current limit dictated by
fiber nonlinearity. However, this appealing idea is frustrated by the
difficulty of designing an effective shaping strategy that takes into account
the nonlinearity and long memory of the fiber channel, as well as the possible
interplay with other nonlinearity mitigation strategies. As a result, only
little progress has been made so far, while the optimal shaping distribution
and the ultimate channel capacity remain unknown. In this work, we describe a
novel technique to optimize the shaping distribution in a very general setting
and high-dimensional space. For a simplified block-memoryless nonlinear optical
channel, the capacity lower bound obtained by the proposed technique can be
expressed analytically, establishing the conditions for an unbounded growth of
capacity with power. In a more realistic scenario, the technique can be
implemented by a rejection sampling algorithm driven by a suitable cost
function, and the corresponding achievable information rate estimated
numerically. The combination of the proposed technique with an improved

first encoded to obtain latent variables under standard normal distribution via
normalizing flows. By modelling static factors in a video as a random variable,
the conditional distribution of each latent variable becomes shifted and scaled
normal. Then, the less-varying latent variables along time are selected as
static cues and suppressed to generate motion-preserved videos. Finally,
positive pairs are constructed by motion-preserved videos for contrastive
learning to alleviate the problem of representation bias to static cues. The
less-biased video representation can be better generalized to various
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art when only

  Extensive-Form Games","To appear at AAAI'22",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The practical scalability of many optimization algorithms for large
extensive-form games is often limited by the games' huge payoff matrices. To
ameliorate the issue, Zhang and Sandholm (2020) recently proposed a
sparsification technique that factorizes the payoff matrix $\mathbf{A}$ into a
sparser object $\mathbf{A} = \hat{\mathbf{A}} + \mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^\top$,
where the total combined number of nonzeros of $\hat{\mathbf{A}}$,
$\mathbf{U}$, and $\mathbf{V}$ is significantly smaller. Such a factorization
can be used in place of the original payoff matrix in many optimization
algorithm, such as interior-point and second-order methods, thus increasing the
size of games that can be handled. Their technique significantly sparsifies
poker (end)games, standard benchmarks used in computational game theory, AI,
and more broadly. We show that the existence of extremely sparse factorizations
in poker games can be tied to their particular \emph{Kronecker-product}
structure. We clarify how such structure arises and introduce the connection
between that structure and sparsification. By leveraging such structure, we
give two ways of computing strong sparsifications of poker games (as well as
any other game with a similar structure) that are i) orders of magnitude faster
to compute, ii) more numerically stable, and iii) produce a dramatically
smaller number of nonzeros than the prior technique. Our techniques enable --
for the first time -- effective computation of high-precision Nash equilibria
and strategies subject to constraints on the amount of allowed randomization.
Furthermore, they significantly speed up parallel first-order game-solving
algorithms; we show state-of-the-art speed on a GPU.

between relevant and irrelevant graph representations through iteratively
optimizing the sample graph weights and graph encoder. We further present a
global weight estimator to learn weights for training graphs such that
variables in graph representations are forced to be independent. The learned
weights help the graph encoder to get rid of spurious correlations and, in
turn, concentrate more on the true connection between learned discriminative
graph representations and their ground-truth labels. We conduct extensive

for its applications in various domains. Researchers have paid much attention
on its partially observable and cooperative settings for meeting real-world
requirements. For testing performance of different algorithms, standardized
environments are designed such as the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which is
one of the most successful MARL benchmarks. To our best knowledge, most of
current environments are synchronous, where agents execute actions in the same
pace. However, heterogeneous agents usually have their own action spaces and
there is no guarantee for actions from different agents to have the same
executed cycle, which leads to asynchronous multi-agent cooperation. Inspired
from the Wargame, a confrontation game between two armies abstracted from real
world environment, we propose the first Partially Observable Asynchronous
multi-agent Cooperation challenge (POAC) for the MARL community. Specifically,
POAC supports two teams of heterogeneous agents to fight with each other, where
an agent selects actions based on its own observations and cooperates
asynchronously with its allies. Moreover, POAC is a light weight, flexible and
easy to use environment, which can be configured by users to meet different
experimental requirements such as self-play model, human-AI model and so on.
Along with our benchmark, we offer six game scenarios of varying difficulties
with the built-in rule-based AI as opponents. Finally, since most MARL
algorithms are designed for synchronous agents, we revise several
representatives to meet the asynchronous setting, and the relatively poor
experimental results validate the challenge of POAC. Source code is released in

several techniques have been proposed to mitigate this problem for image

exploiting a peculiar feature that differentiates it from natural images,

however typically conflating the effects of different sources contributing to
the water motion. Time-varying magnetic field gradients have recently been
considered for disentangling such effects during the data encoding phase,
opening to the possibility of adding specificity to the recovered information

time-varying magnetic field gradients. Then, we provide the basis for
incorporating this model into two multidimensional dMRI methods, and attempt to

dependence of these phase transitions. Herein we present the results of a

transition between polar $A2_{1}am$ and non-polar $Acaa$ structures.
Interestingly, we show that while the application of pressure ultimately
favours a non-polar phase -- as is commonly observed for proper ferroelectrics
-- regions of response exist where pressure actually acts to increase the polar
mode amplitudes. The reason for this can be untangled by considering the varied
response of octahedral tilts and rotations to hydrostatic pressure and their
trilinear coupling with the polar instability.

conceal the effects of their new degrees of freedom from the scrutiny of
terrestrial and solar system experiments. However, extreme properties of
nuclear matter may lead to a partial failure of screening mechanisms inside the
most massive neutron stars observed in Nature, opening up the possibility of
probing these theories with neutron star observations. In this work we explore
equilibrium and stability properties of neutron stars in two variants of the
symmetron model. We show that around sufficiently compact neutron stars, the
symmetron is amplified with respect to its background, cosmological value by
several orders of magnitude, and that properties of such unscreened stars are
sensitive to corrections to the leading linear coupling between the symmetron

Most of the studies about sarin are theoretical/computational due to its high
lethality and are concentrated in its detection and degradation. Few studies
are about air filtration from sarin gas. Here, the potential of graphene
oxide-based membranes to filter air from sarin/air mixtures is investigated by
classical molecular dynamics simulations. Membranes formed by one and two
nanosheets of porous reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were considered. The passage
of sarin and air molecules through these membranes from a highly concentrated

relative concentration. Sarin molecules are shown to be trapped by hydroxyl and
carboxyl chemical groups in the nanosheet, while a considerable passage of air
molecules (N$_2$, O$_2$ and Ar) through the membranes was verified. The results
show the capacity of the rGO membranes to retain sarin from passing through,
even at high temperatures, thus indicating their potential to be used as a
filter for sarin gas.

should be properly distributed among edge devices to ensure fair resources
utilization and guarantee seamless execution. This article investigates the use
of deep learning to fairly distribute the tasks. An attention-based neural
network model is proposed to generate efficient load balancing solutions under
different scenarios. The proposed model is based on the Transformer and Pointer
Network architectures, and is trained by an advantage actor-critic
reinforcement learning algorithm. The model is designed to scale to the number
of event processing tasks and the number of edge devices, with no need for
hyperparameters re-tuning or even retraining. Extensive experimental results
show that the proposed model outperforms conventional heuristics in many key
performance indicators. The generic design and the obtained results show that
the proposed model can potentially be applied to several other load balancing
problem variations, which makes the proposal an attractive option to be used in
real-world scenarios due to its scalability and efficiency.

critical magnetic Reynolds number of about 25 above which the work done against

two-thirds go first into kinetic energy of the turbulence before a fraction of
it is converted further into magnetic and finally thermal energies. Close to
the collapse, however, these fractions change toward 1/4 and 3/4 for
compressional heating and kinetic energy, respectively. When the magnetic field
is strong, the compressional heating fraction is unchanged. Out of the
remaining kinetic energy, one quarter goes directly into magnetic energy via
work against the Lorentz force. The fraction of vortical motions diminishes in
favor of compressive motions that are almost exclusively driven by the Jeans
instability. For an initially uniform magnetic field, field amplification at

the clinical setting. We have generalized the iVFM for a three-dimensional

vector fields in a full intraventricular volume by using a clinical
echocardiographic triplane mode. As with the 2-D version, the method is based
on the mass conservation, and free-slip boundary conditions on the endocardial
wall. These mechanical constraints were imposed in a least-squares minimization
problem that was solved through the method of Lagrange multipliers. We
validated 3D-iVFM in silico in a patient-specific CFD (computational fluid
dynamics) model of cardiac flow, and tested its feasibility in vivo on
volunteers. In both in silico and in vivo investigations, the dynamics of the
intraventricular vortex that forms during diastole was deciphered by 3D-iVFM.
Our results tend to indicate that 3D-iVFM could provide full-volume

methods that meet the physical requirements of the models under study. We
develop a new procedure for applying Constrained Implicit Regularization which
simplifies the calculation of amplitudes, including finite parts. The algebraic
identities to separate the divergent parts free from the external momenta are
used after the Feynman parametrization. These algebraic identities establish a
set of scale relations which are always the same and do not need to be
calculated in each situation. This procedure unifies the calculations in
massive and non-massive models in an unique procedure. We establish a
systematization of the calculation of one-loop amplitudes and extend the

Bakkali-Hassan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 023603 (2021)]. Here, we use a
similar multicomponent platform to exemplify theoretically and numerically,
within the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii framework, the potential toward the
experimental realization of a different fundamental wave structure, namely the
Peregrine soliton. Leveraging the effective attractive interaction produced
within the mixture's minority species in the immiscible regime, we illustrate
how initialization of the condensate with a suitable power-law decaying spatial
density pattern yields the robust emergence of the Peregrine wave in the
absence and in the presence of a parabolic trap. We then showcase the
spontaneous emergence of the Peregrine soliton via a suitably crafted wide
Gaussian initialization, again both in the homogeneous case and in the trap
scenario. It is also found that narrower wave packets may result in periodic
revivals of the Peregrine soliton, while broader ones give rise to a cascade of
Peregrine solitons arranged in a so-called Christmas-tree structure.
Strikingly, the persistence of these rogue-wave structures is demonstrated in
certain temperature regimes as well as in the presence of transversal
excitations through three-dimensional computations in a quasi-one-dimensional
regime. This proof-of-principle illustration is expected to represent a
practically feasible way to generate and observe this rogue wave in realistic
current ultracold atom experimental settings.

three quantum error correcting codes in the context of the rare-earth-ion-doped
crystal (RE) platform for quantum computing. We analyze pseudothresholds for
these codes when parallel operations are not available, and examine the
behavior both with and without resting errors. In RE systems, resting errors
can be mitigated by extending the system's ground state coherence time. For the
codes we study, we find that if the ground state coherence time is roughly 100
times larger than the excited state coherence time, resting errors become small
enough to be negligible compared to other error sources. This leads us to the
conclusion that beneficial QEC could be achieved in the RE system with the
expected gate fidelities available in the NISQ regime. However, for codes using
more qubits and operations, a factor of more than 100 would be required.
Furthermore, we investigate how often QEC should be performed in a circuit. We
find that for early experiments in RE systems, the minimal $[\![5,1,3]\!]$
would be most suitable as it has a high threshold error and uses few qubits.
However, when more qubits are available the $[\![9,1,3]\!]$ surface code might
be a better option due to its higher circuit performance. Our findings are
important for steering experiments to an efficient path for realizing
beneficial quantum error correcting codes in early RE systems where resources
are limited.

includes a scalar (dilaton) field we address the important question of how the
classical black hole geometry is modified in a semiclassical gravitational
theory. It is the principle goal of this paper to analyze what is the
back-reacted geometry that corresponds to a given quantum state. The story is
shown to be dramatically different for the Hartle-Hawking state (HH) and for
the Boulware state. In the HH case the back-reacted geometry is a modification
of the classical black hole metric that still has a smooth horizon with a
regular curvature. On the other hand, for the Boulware state the classical
horizon is replaced by a throat in which the $(tt)$ component of the metric
(while non-zero) is extremely small. The value of the metric at the throat is
bounded by the inverse of the classical black hole entropy. On the other side
of the throat the spacetime is ended at a null singularity. More generally, we
identify a family of quantum states and their respective back-reacted
geometries. We also identify a certain duality in the space of states. Finally,
we study a hybrid set-up where both physical and non-physical fields, such as
the ghosts, could be present. We suggest that it is natural to associate ghosts
with the Boulware state, while the physical fields can be in any quantum state.
In particular, if the physical fields are in the HH state, then the
corresponding semiclassical geometry is horizonless. Depending on the balance
between the number of physical fields and ghosts, it generically has a throat
that may join with another asymptotically flat region on the other side of the
throat.

isomorphic to a torus knot group. The reflection group is obtained from the
torus knot group by declaring meridians to have order $k$ for some $k\geq 2$,
and meridians are mapped to reflections. We study all possible quotients of
torus knot groups obtained by requiring meridians to have finite order. Using
the theory of $J$-groups of Achar and Aubert, we show that these groups behave
like (in general infinite) complex reflection groups of rank two. The large
family of ""toric reflection groups"" which we obtain includes, among others, all
finite complex reflection groups of rank two with a single conjugacy class of
reflecting hyperplanes, as well as Coxeter's truncations of the $3$-strand
braid group. We classify these toric reflection groups and explain why the
corresponding torus knot group can be naturally considered as its braid group.
In particular, this yields a new infinite family of reflection-like groups
admitting a braid group which is a Garside group. Moreover, we show that a
toric reflection group has cyclic center by showing that the quotient by the
center is isomorphic to the alternating subgroup of a Coxeter group of rank
three. To this end we use the fact that the center of the alternating subgroup
of an irreducible, infinite Coxeter group of rank at least three is trivial.
Several ingredients of the proofs are purely Coxeter-theoretic, and might be of
independent interest.

supernovae (SNe Ia) that will be used to infer cosmological parameters as part
of the Pantheon+ SN analysis and the SH0ES (Supernovae and H0 for the Equation
of State of dark energy) distance-ladder analysis. This effort is one part of a
series of works that perform an extensive review of redshifts, peculiar
velocities, photometric calibration, and intrinsic-scatter models of SNe Ia.
The total number of light curves, which are compiled across 18 different
surveys, is a significant increase from the first Pantheon analysis (1048 SNe),
particularly at low redshift ($z$). Furthermore, unlike in the Pantheon
analysis, we include light curves for SNe with $z<0.01$ such that SN systematic
covariance can be included in a joint measurement of the Hubble constant
(H$_0$) and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter ($w$). We use the large
sample to compare properties of 151 SNe Ia observed by multiple surveys and 12
pairs/triplets of ""SN siblings"" - SNe found in the same host galaxy. Distance
measurements, application of bias corrections, and inference of cosmological
parameters are discussed in the companion paper by Brout et al. (2022b), and
the determination of H$_0$ is discussed by Riess et al. (2022). These analyses
will measure w with $\sim3\%$ precision and H$_0$ with 1 km/s/Mpc precision.

Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) including those used for the
SH0ES distance-ladder measurement of H$_0$. We utilize the large and uniform
sky coverage of the public Pan-STARRS stellar photometry catalog to
cross-calibrate against tertiary standards released by individual SN Ia
surveys. The most significant updates over the `SuperCal' cross-calibration
used for the previous Pantheon and SH0ES analyses are: 1) expansion of the
number of photometric systems (now 25) and filters (now 105), 2) solving for
all filter offsets in all systems simultaneously in order to produce a
calibration uncertainty covariance matrix that can be used in
cosmological-model constraints, and 3) accounting for the change in the
fundamental flux calibration of the HST CALSPEC standards from previous
versions on the order of $1.5\%$ over a $\Delta \lambda$ of 4000~\AA. The
re-calibration of samples used for light-curve fitting has historically been
decoupled from the retraining of the light-curve model. Here, we are able to
retrain the SALT2 model using this new calibration and find the change in the
model coupled with the change to the calibration of the light-curves themselves
causes a net distance modulus change ($d\mu/dz$) of 0.04 mag over the redshift
range $0<z<1$. We introduce a new formalism to determine the systematic impact
on cosmological inference by propagating the covariance in fitted calibration
offsets through retraining simultaneously with light-curve fitting and find a
total calibration uncertainty impact of $\sigma_w=0.013$, which is roughly half
the size of the sample statistical uncertainty. Similarly, we find a systematic
SN calibration contribution to the SH0ES H$_0$ uncertainty is less than
0.2~km/s/Mpc, suggesting that SN Ia calibration cannot resolve the current
level of the `Hubble Tension'.

large datasets for training data-hungry models. These approaches synthesize

supervision over any label type while still offering desirable properties,
including practical flexibility, computational efficiency, and theoretical

tackled by WS frameworks including learning to rank, regression, and learning
in hyperbolic space. Theoretically, our synthesis approach produces a
consistent estimators for learning some challenging but important

real-world learning-to-rank and regression problems along with learning on

theoretical and experimental evidence that heterogeneities can generate

derive a minimal theoretical model describing the growth of localised Faraday

decay. The observations support the conjecture that such radiation is either

the allowed range of parameters for sGB gravity. We also transfer the derived

Monte Carlo calculations are performed on the three different computational

Simplified proton beam to the pregnant women brain was modelled, and the total

Between MCNPX and MCNP6.2 code versions we observed up to 6% difference. In
this work 3 groups participated and the variation between the groups was 8% and
12% for MCNPX and MCNP6.2, respectively. Depending on the phantom used in the
calculations the fetal dose was between 0.4 and 0.8 {\mu}Sv/Gy. Major
contribution to the total dose came from the neutrons, with only 20% of the

Results of the total dose equivalent differ by factor of two, when different

In addition, these models are trained on generic datasets that are not
exhaustive in capturing user-specific characteristics. Recently, on-device
personalization techniques have been making strides in mitigating the problem.
Although many current works have already explored the effectiveness of
on-device personalization, the majority of their findings are limited to
simulation settings or a specific smartphone. In this paper, we develop and
provide a detailed explanation of our framework to train end-to-end models in
mobile phones. To make it simple, we considered a model based on connectionist
temporal classification (CTC) loss. We evaluated the framework on various
mobile phones from different brands and reported the results. We provide enough
evidence that fine-tuning the models and choosing the right hyperparameter
values is a trade-off between the lowest WER achievable, training time
on-device, and memory consumption. Hence, this is vital for a successful
deployment of on-device training onto a resource-limited environment like
mobile phones. We use training sets from speakers with different accents and
record a 7.6% decrease in average word error rate (WER). We also report the
associated computational cost measurements with respect to time, memory usage,
and cpu utilization in mobile phones in real-time.

become ubiquitous and their applications expand, users turn to them for not
just routine tasks, but also intelligent conversations. In this study, we
measure the emotional intelligence (EI) displayed by IPAs in the English and
Hindi languages; to our knowledge, this is a pioneering effort in probing the
emotional intelligence of IPAs in Indian languages. We pose utterances that
convey the Sadness or Humor emotion and evaluate IPA responses. We build on
previous research to propose a quantitative and qualitative evaluation scheme
encompassing new criteria from social science perspectives (display of empathy,
wit, understanding) and IPA-specific features (voice modulation, search
redirects).
  We find EI displayed by Google Assistant in Hindi is comparable to EI
displayed in English, with the assistant employing both voice modulation and
emojis in text. However, we do find that IPAs are unable to understand and
respond intelligently to all queries, sometimes even offering
counter-productive and problematic responses. Our experiment offers evidence
and directions to augment the potential for EI in IPAs.

partons traversing the boost-invariant, non-perturbative glasma as created at
the early stages of collisions at RHIC and LHC. Since these highly energetic
partons are produced from hard scatterings during heavy-ion collisions, they
are already affected by the first stage of the medium's time evolution, the
glasma, which is the pre-equilibrium precursor state of the quark-gluon plasma.
We find that partons quickly accumulate transverse momentum up to the
saturation momentum during the glasma stage. Moreover, we observe an
interesting anisotropy in transverse momentum broadening of partons with larger
broadening in the rapidity than in the azimuthal direction. Its origin can be
related to correlations among the longitudinal color-electric and
color-magnetic flux tubes in the initial state of the glasma. We compare these
observations to the semi-analytic results obtained by a weak-field
approximation, where we also find such an anisotropy in a parton's transverse
momentum broadening.

also solids with Platonic properties (also known as regular polyhedra) in four
and higher dimensions. The concept of Platonic Bell inequalities in the
three-dimensional Euclidean space was introduced by Tavakoli and Gisin [Quantum
4, 293 (2020)]. For any three-dimensional Platonic solid, an arrangement of
projective measurements is associated where the measurement directions point
toward the vertices of the solids. For the higher dimensional regular
polyhedra, we use the correspondence of the vertices to the measurements in the
abstract Tsirelson space. We give a remarkably simple formula for the quantum
violation of all the Platonic Bell inequalities, which we prove to attain the
maximum possible quantum violation of the Bell inequalities, i.e. the Tsirelson
bound. To construct Bell inequalities with a large number of settings, it is
crucial to compute the local bound efficiently. In general, the computation
time required to compute the local bound grows exponentially with the number of
measurement settings. We find a method to compute the local bound exactly for
any bipartite two-outcome Bell inequality, where the dependence becomes
polynomial whose degree is the rank of the Bell matrix. To show that this
algorithm can be used in practice, we compute the local bound of a 300-setting
Platonic Bell inequality based on the halved dodecaplex. In addition, we use a
diagonal modification of the original Platonic Bell matrix to increase the
ratio of quantum to local bound. In this way, we obtain a four-dimensional
60-setting Platonic Bell inequality based on the halved tetraplex for which the
quantum violation exceeds the $\sqrt 2$ ratio.

show that fermion rephasing invariance imposes that several coefficients

against the class of low-degree polynomial methods and the sum-of-squares (SoS)
hierarchy for recovering certain hidden structures planted in Gaussian
clustering instances. Prior work on many similar inference tasks portends that
such lower bounds strongly suggest the presence of an inherent
statistical-to-computational gap for clustering, that is, a parameter regime
where the clustering task is statistically possible but no polynomial-time
algorithm succeeds.
  One special case of the clustering task we consider is equivalent to the
problem of finding a planted hypercube vector in an otherwise random subspace.
We show that, perhaps surprisingly, this particular clustering model does not
exhibit a statistical-to-computational gap, even though the aforementioned
low-degree and SoS lower bounds continue to apply in this case. To achieve
this, we give a polynomial-time algorithm based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lovasz

complexity of d+1 samples. This result extends the class of problems whose

with binding energies in the range of ~0.1 - 0.6 eV/atom. Upon examining the
$z$-separation, the charge transfer, and the electronic density of states at

debris is stretched into an elongated stream. The longitudinal motion of the
stream follows geodesics in the Kerr spacetime and the evolution in the
transverse dimensions is decoupled from the longitudinal motion. Using an
approximate tidal equation, we calculate the evolution of the stream thickness
along the geodesic, during which we treat the effect of nozzle shocks as a
perfect bounce. Intersection occurs when the thickness exceeds the closest
approach separation. This algorithm allows us to explore a wide parameter space
of orbital angular momenta, inclinations, and BH spins to obtain the properties
of stream intersection. We identify two collision modes, split evenly among all
cases: ""rear-end"" collisions near the pericenter at an angle close to $0$ and
""head-on"" collisions far from the pericenter at an angle close to $\pi$. The
intersection typically occurs between consecutive half-orbits with a delay time
that spans a wide range (from months up to a decade). The intersection radius
generally increases with the orbital angular momentum and depends less strongly
on the inclination and BH spin. The thickness ratio of the colliding ends is of
order unity. The transverse separation is a small fraction of the sum of the
two thicknesses, so a large fraction of the stream is shock-heated in an offset
collision. Many of the numerical results can be analytically understood in a
post-Newtonian picture, where the orientation of an elliptical orbit undergoes
apsidal and Lense-Thirring precessions. Instead of thickness inflation due to
energy dissipation at nozzle shocks as invoked in earlier works, we find the
physical reason for stream collision to be a geometric one. After the
collision, we expect the gas to undergo secondary shocks and form an accretion
disk, generating bright electromagnetic emission.

fundamental physics, and cosmology, but some of the most promising signals
reside near or beyond the virial radius. While these scales have recently
become observable, the profiles at large radii are still poorly understood
theoretically, chiefly because the distribution of orbiting matter (the
one-halo term) is partially concealed by particles falling into halos for the
first time. We present an algorithm to dynamically disentangle the orbiting and
infalling contributions by counting the pericentric passages of billions of
simulation particles. We analyse dynamically split profiles out to 10 R200m
across a wide range of halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. We show that the
orbiting term experiences a sharp truncation at the edge of the orbit
distribution. Its sharpness and position are mostly determined by the mass
accretion rate, confirming that the entire profile shape primarily depends on
halo dynamics and secondarily on mass, redshift, and cosmology. The infalling
term also depends on the accretion rate for fast-accreting haloes but is mostly
set by the environment for slowly accreting haloes, leading to a diverse array
of shapes that does not conform to simple theoretical models. While the
resulting scatter in the infalling term reaches 1 dex, the scatter in the
orbiting term is only between 0.1 and 0.4 dex and almost independent of radius.

this problem with a number of product measurements much smaller than what is

classical computational resources. Digital quantum computers provide a possible
way forward but noise limits their use in the near-term. We propose a scheme to

phases that operates with a shallow depth circuit. Starting from a ""clean""
periodic circuit that simulates the dynamical evolution of a Floquet system, we
introduce quasi-periodicity to the circuit parameters to prevent thermalization
by introducing many-body localization. By inspecting the time averaged
properties of the many-body integrals of motion, the phase structure can then
be probed using random measurements. This approach avoids the need to compute
the ground state and operates at finite energy density. We numerically
demonstrate this scheme with a simulation of the Floquet Ising model of
time-crystals and present results clearly distinguishing different Floquet
phases in the absence of quasi-periodicity in the circuit parameters. Our
results pave the way for mapping phase diagrams of exotic systems on near-term
quantum devices.

results show that there is more information available in the

between parameters of the cosmological model such as
$M_\nu$--$\sigma_\mathrm{8}$ or $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$--$\sigma_8$, the power
spectra computed in identified environments improve the constraints on
cosmological parameters by factors $\sim 15$ for the summed neutrino mass
$M_\nu$ and $\sim 8$ for the matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ over those
derived from the matter power spectrum. We show that these tighter constraints
are obtained for a wide range of the maximum scale, from $k_\mathrm{max} = 0.1$

also report an eight times higher value of the signal-to-noise ratio for the
combination of spectra compared to the matter one. Importantly, we show that
all the presented results are robust to variations of the parameters defining
the environments hence suggesting a robustness to the definition we chose to

By combining information on stellar elemental abundances and kinematics, we
constructed separate samples of Kepler stars according to their affiliation to
the Galactic components of thin disk, thick disk and stellar halo. Using a
Bayesian analysis with conjugate priors, we then investigated how planet
occurrence rates differ in different regions of planet properties. We find that
young, slow and metal-rich stars, associated mainly with the thin disk, host on
average more planets (especially close-in super Earths) compared to the old,
fast and metal-poor thick disk stars. We further assess the dependence between
stellar properties such as spectral type and metallicity, and planet occurrence
rates. The trends we find agree with those found by other authors as well. We

of classifying the integrable bosonic 2d $\sigma$-models. We include
non-conformal $\sigma$-models, which have historically been a good arena for
discovering integrable models that were later generalized to Weyl-invariant
ones. General $\sigma$-models feature a quantum RG flow, given by a
'generalized Ricci flow' of the target-space geometry.
  This thesis is based on the conjecture that integrable $\sigma$-models are
renormalizable, or stable under the RG flow. It is widely understood that
classically integrable theories are stable at the leading 1-loop order with
only a few parameters running. Here we address what happens at higher-loop
orders. We find that integrable $\sigma$-models generally remain RG-stable at
higher-loops provided they receive a particular choice of finite counterterms,
or quantum ($\alpha'$) corrections to the target-space geometry.
  We explicitly construct these quantum corrections for examples of integrable
$\eta$- and $\lambda$-deformed $\sigma$-models. We then reformulate the
$\lambda$-models as $\sigma$-models on a ""tripled"" $G \times G \times G$
configuration space, where they become automatically renormalizable due to
manifest symmetries and a decoupling of some fields. We also consider the
integrable $G \times G$ and $G \times G/H$ models and construct a new class of
integrable $G \times G/H$ models with abelian $H$.
  We then present a new and different link between integrability and the RG
flow in the context of $\sigma$-models with 'local couplings' depending
explicitly on 2d time. Such models are naturally obtained in the light-cone
gauge in string theory, pointing to the possibility of a large, new class of
solvable string models.

galaxies is often considered to be perfectly elliptical. Potential angular
structures are generally ignored, except to explain flux ratios anomalies.
Surprisingly, the impact of azimuthal structures on extended images of the
source has not been characterized, nor its impact on the H0 inference. We
address this task by creating mock images of a point source embedded in an
extended source, lensed by an elliptical galaxy on which multipolar components
are added to emulate boxy/discy isodensity contours. Modeling such images with
a density profile free of angular structure allow us to explore the
detectability of image deformation induced by the multipoles in the residual
frame. Multipole deformations are almost always detectable for our highest
signal-to-noise mock data. However the detectability depends on the lens
ellipticity and Einstein radius, on the S/N of the data, and on the specific
lens modeling strategy. Multipoles also introduce small changes to the time
delays. We therefore quantify how undetected multipoles would impact H0
inference. When no multipoles are detected in the residuals, the impact on H0
for a given lens is in general less than a few km/s/Mpc, but in the worst case
scenario, combining low S/N in the ring and large intrinsic boxyness/discyness,
the bias on H0 can reach 10-12 km/s/Mpc. If we now look at the inference on H0
from a population of lensing galaxies, having a distribution of multipoles
representative of what is found in the light-profile of elliptical galaxies, we
then find a systematic bias on H0 < 1%. The comparison of our mock systems to
the state-of-the-art time delay lens sample studied by the H0LiCOW and TDCOSMO
collaborations, indicates that multipoles are currently unlikely to be a source
of substantial systematic bias on the inferred value of H0 from time-delay
lenses.

plasma threaded by a poloidal magnetic field. Non-thermal flares and high
energy components could originate from a hot, collisionless and nearly
force-free corona. The jets we often observe from these systems are believed to
be rotation-powered and magnetically-driven.
  Aims: We study axisymmetric BH magnetospheres where some magnetic field lines
anchored in a surrounding disk can connect to the event horizon of a rotating
BH. We identify the sites of magnetic reconnection within 30 gravitational
radii depending on the BH spin.
  Methods: With the fully general relativistic particle-in-cell code GRZeltron,
we solve the time-dependent dynamics of the electron-positron pair plasma and
of the electromagnetic fields around the BH. The disk is represented by a
steady plasma in Keplerian rotation, threaded by a frozen dipolar field.
  Results: For prograde disks, twisted open magnetic field lines crossing the
horizon power a Blandford-Znajek jet while beyond a critical distance, open
field lines on the disk are open. In the innermost regions, coupling field
lines ensure the transfer of significant amounts of angular momentum and energy
between the BH and the disk. From the Y-point at the intersection, a current
sheet forms where particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection takes place.
We compute the synchrotron images of the current sheet emission.
  Conclusions: Our estimates for jet power and BH-disk exchanges match those
derived from purely force-free models. Dissipation at the Y-point heats the
corona and provides a physically motivated source of hard X-rays above the disk
for reflection models. Episodic plasmoid ejection might explain millisecond
flares observed in Cyg X-1. Particles flowing from the Y-point down to the disk
could produce a hot spot at the footpoint of the outermost closed field line.

that follows the dark matter distribution measured from weak lensing, and an
intriguing transitional component between 70 and 200 kpc. To investigate the
origin of this transition, we split the clusters into two subsamples by their
BCG stellar mass $M_*^{\mathrm{BCG}}$ (mass enclosed roughly within 50 kpc)
while making sure they have the same distribution of satellite richness. The
$\Sigma_{*}^{\texttt{B+I}}$ profiles of the two subsamples differ by more than
a factor of two at $R{<}50\,\mathrm{kpc}$, consistent with their 0.34 dex
difference in $M_*^{\mathrm{BCG}}$, whereas on scales beyond 400 kpc the two
profiles converge to the same amplitudes, suggesting a satellite-stripping
origin of the outer ICL. Remarkably, however, the discrepancy between the two
$\Sigma_{*}^{\texttt{B+I}}$ profiles persist at above $50\%$ level on all
scales below 200 kpc, thereby revealing the BCG sphere of influence with radius
$R_{\mathrm{SOI}}{\simeq}$ 200 kpc. Finally, we speculate that the surprisingly
large sphere of influence of the BCG is tied to the elevated escape velocity
profile within $r_s$, the characteristic radius of the dark matter haloes.

possible thanks to the joint analysis of blank non-lensed fields (COSMOS/SMUVS)
and cluster lensing fields (Hubble Frontier Fields) which allow us to reach
very low stellar masses. Previous works have revealed the existence of a clear
bimodality in the SFR-M* plane with a star-formation Main Sequence and a
starburst cloud at z ~ 4-5. Here we show that this bimodality extends to all
star-forming galaxies and is valid in the whole redshift range z ~ 3-6.5. We
find that starbursts constitute at least 20% of all star-forming galaxies with
M* >~ 10^9 Msun at these redshifts and reach a peak of 40% at z=4-5. More
importantly, 60% to 90% of the total SFR budget at these redshifts is contained

dominant at high redshifts. Almost all the low stellar-mass starbursts with
log10(M*/Msun) <~ 8.5 have ages comparable to the typical timescales of a
starburst event, suggesting that these galaxies are being caught in the process

gas that might have been missed in studies of other galaxies. We have estimated
the mass of the ISM using four different tracers, always obtaining an estimate

mass estimate of (0.8-1.3) x 10^{11} M_sol. We suggest that this conflict and
other similar conflicts reported in the literature is because the gas-to-tracer
ratios are ~4 times lower than the Galactic values used to calibrate the ISM in

properties are also severely impacted. Most importantly, we arrive at a variety
of mass-radius relations of white dwarfs which accommodate sub- to
super-Chandrasekhar mass limits. This urges caution when using white dwarfs
associated with SNeIa as standard candles.

Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are all critically dependent
on estimates of photometric redshifts. Capsule networks are a new type of
neural network architecture that is better suited for identifying morphological
features of the input images than traditional convolutional neural networks. We
use a deep capsule network trained on $ugriz$ images, spectroscopic redshifts,
and Galaxy Zoo spiral/elliptical classifications of $\sim$400,000 Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies to do photometric redshift estimation. We achieve a
photometric redshift prediction accuracy and a fraction of catastrophic
outliers that are comparable to or better than current methods for SDSS main
galaxy sample-like data sets ($r\leq17.8$ and $z_{\mathrm{spec}}\leq0.4$) while
requiring less data and fewer trainable parameters. Furthermore, the
decision-making of our capsule network is much more easily interpretable as
capsules act as a low-dimensional encoding of the image. When the capsules are
projected on a 2-dimensional manifold, they form a single redshift sequence
with the fraction of spirals in a region exhibiting a gradient roughly
perpendicular to the redshift sequence. We perturb encodings of real galaxy
images in this low-dimensional space to create synthetic galaxy images that
demonstrate the image properties (e.g., size, orientation, and surface
brightness) encoded by each dimension. We also measure correlations between
galaxy properties (e.g., magnitudes, colours, and stellar mass) and each
capsule dimension. We publicly release our code, estimated redshifts, and
additional catalogues at https://biprateep.github.io/encapZulate-1 .

clusters, stellar associations and stellar streams are based on isochrone
fitting or the lithium depletion boundary. We propose another method for dating
these objects based on the morphology of their extended tidal tails, which have
been recently discovered around several open star clusters. Assuming that the
early-appearing tidal tails, the so called tidal tails I, originate from the
stars released from the cluster during early gas expulsion, or that they form
in the same star forming region as the cluster (i.e. being coeval with the
cluster), we derive the analytical formula for the tilt angle $\beta$ between
the long axis of the tidal tail and the orbital direction for clusters or
streams on circular trajectories. Since at a given Galactocentric radius,
$\beta$ is only a function of age $t$ regardless of the initial properties of
the cluster, we estimate the cluster age by inverting the analytical formula
$\beta = \beta (t)$. We illustrate the method on a sample of $12$ objects,
which we compiled from the literature, and we find a reasonable agreement with
previous dating methods in $\approx 70$% of the cases. This can probably be
improved by taking into account the eccentricity of the orbits and by
revisiting the dating methods based on stellar evolution. The proposed
morphological method is suitable for relatively young clusters (age $\lesssim
300$ Myr), where it provides a relative age error of the order of $10$ to $20$%
for an error in the observed tilt angle of $5 ^\circ$.

several blazars, the radio emission occurs with a significant delay w.r.t. to
$\gamma$-ray band, with timescales ranging from weeks to years. Such
observational evidence has been a matter of debate for years and usually is
interpreted as a signature of the $\gamma$-ray emission originating upstream in
the jet, with the emitting region becoming radio transparent at larger scales.
In this paper, we show, by means of self-consistent numerical modelling, that
the adiabatic expansion of relativistic blob can explain these delays. We use
the JetSeT framework to reproduce the numerical modelling of the
radiative/accelerative processes, reproducing the temporal evolution, from the
initial flaring activity, and the subsequent expansion. We follow the spectral
evolution and the light curves, investigating the relations among the observed
parameters, rise, time, and decay time, identifying the link with the physical
parameters. We find that, when adiabatic expansion is active, lags due to the
shift of the synchrotron frequency occur, with an offset equal to the distance
in time between the flaring onset and the beginning of the expansion, whilst
the rising and decaying timescales depend on the velocity of the expansion and
on time required to the source to exhibit a synchrotron self-absorption
frequency. We derive an inter-band response function, and we investigate the
effects of the competitions between radiative and adiabatic cooling timescales
on the response. We apply the response function to long-term radio and
$\gamma-$ray light curves of Mrk 421, Mrk 501 and 3C 273, finding a
satisfactory agreement on the log-term behaviour, and we use a Monte Carlo
Markov Chain approach, to estimate some physical relevant parameters. We
discuss the applications to polarization measurements, and to jets collimation

used to extrapolate the survivor function. One such model is the piecewise
exponential model whereby the hazard function is partitioned into segments,

and the boundaries of these segments are known as change-points. We present an
approach for determining the location and number of change-points in piecewise
exponential models. Inference is performed in a Bayesian framework using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) where the model parameters can be integrated out of
the model and the number of change-points can be sampled as part of the MCMC
scheme. We can estimate both the uncertainty in the change-point locations and
hazards for a given change-point model and obtain a probabilistic
interpretation for the number of change-points. We evaluate model performance
to determine changepoint numbers and locations in a simulation study and show
the utility of the method using two data sets for time to event data. In a
dataset of Glioblastoma patients we use the piecewise exponential model to
describe the general trends in the hazard function. In a data set of heart
transplant patients, we show the piecewise exponential model produces the best
statistical fit and extrapolation amongst other standard parametric models.
Piecewise exponential models may be useful for survival extrapolation if a

this method is that the number and change-point locations are automatically
estimated rather than specified by the analyst.

quasi-classical approximation that was recently employed to obtain an explicit
solution for arbitrary Rashba and Dresselhaus SOC [PRL 112, 156601 (2019)]. It
is found that the quasi-classical approximation yields significantly different
results even to lowest order in the magnetic field and appears unsuitable for
reliable parameter fitting. The discrepancy emerges when a sum over Landau
levels is replaced by an integral over wave vectors. Substantial improvement is
achieved by supplementing the quasi-classical model with the first two
corrections given by the Euler-MacLaurin formula. Corresponding modifications
are, however, only feasible in special SOC parameter configurations where the
mixing of Landau bands is negligible and a closed-form solution that accounts
for Landau quantization is also available. Such a scenario appears in a
parameter regime where a persistent spin helix emerges and a transition between
weak anti- and weak localization takes place. Combining recent findings, we
derive a generalized closed-form expression for the magneto-conductivity
correction applicable to generic 2DEGs that are grown along a crystal direction
with at least two growth-direction Miller indices equal in modulus. The result
is a function of spin lifetimes of the long-lived spin textures and is valid
close to the persistent-spin-helix regime. The accuracy of the derived formula
is validated by comparing with results from numerical diagonalization of the

in trivial generalisation error bounds in this setting as well, we show that
transductive Rademacher complexity can explain the generalisation properties of
graph convolutional networks for stochastic block models. We further use the
generalisation error bounds based on transductive Rademacher complexity to
demonstrate the role of graph convolutions and network architectures in
achieving smaller generalisation error and provide insights into when the graph

as well as aligned-spin configurations. We also discuss the inverse problem of
extracting the associated fluxes from scattering data. Afterwards we
demonstrate, to all orders in the Post-Minkowskian expansion, the link between
the radiated energy and the ultraviolet pole in the radial action in
dimensional regularization due to tail effects. This implies, as expected, that
the B2B correspondence for the conservative sector remains unchanged for
local-in-time radiation-reaction tail effects with generic orbits. As a side
product, this allows us to read off the energy flux from the associated pole in
the tail Hamiltonian. We show that the B2B map also holds for non-local-in-time
terms, but only in the large-eccentricity limit. Remarkably, we find that all
of the trademark logarithmic contributions to the radial action map unscathed

Significant focus has been placed on creating algorithms to estimate
individualized treatment rules (ITR), which map from patient covariates to the
space of available treatments with the goal of maximizing patient outcome.
Direct Learning (D-Learning) is a recent one-step method which estimates the
ITR by directly modeling the treatment-covariate interaction. However, when the
variance of the outcome is heterogeneous with respect to treatment and
covariates, D-Learning does not leverage this structure. Stabilized Direct
Learning (SD-Learning), proposed in this paper, utilizes potential
heteroscedasticity in the error term through a residual reweighting which
models the residual variance via flexible machine learning algorithms such as
XGBoost and random forests. We also develop an internal cross-validation scheme
which determines the best residual model amongst competing models. SD-Learning
improves the efficiency of D-Learning estimates in binary and multi-arm
treatment scenarios. The method is simple to implement and an easy way to
improve existing algorithms within the D-Learning family, including original
D-Learning, Angle-based D-Learning (AD-Learning), and Robust D-Learning
(RD-Learning). We provide theoretical properties and justification of the
optimality of SD-Learning. Head-to-head performance comparisons with D-Learning
methods are provided through simulations, which demonstrate improvement in

value, along with data analysis of an AIDS randomized clinical trial.

emergence of thermodynamics. In the last decade, cyclic heat engines that have
large fluctuations and operate at finite time were studied within the more
modern framework of stochastic thermodynamics. The second law for such heat
engines states that the efficiency cannot be larger than the Carnot efficiency.
The concept of cyclic active heat engines for a system in the presence of
hidden dissipative degrees of freedom, also known as a nonequilibrium or active
reservoir, has also been studied in theory and experiment. Such active engines
show rather interesting behavior such as an ``efficiency'' larger than the
Carnot bound. They are also likely to play an important role in future
developments, given the ubiquitous presence of active media. However, a general
second law for cyclic active heat engines has been lacking so far. Here, upon
using a known inequality in stochastic stochastic thermodynamics for the excess
entropy, we obtain a general second law for active heat engines, which does not
involve the energy dissipation of the hidden degrees of freedom and is
expressed in terms of quantities that can be measured directly from the
observable degrees of freedom. Besides heat and work, our second law contains
an information-theoretic term, which allows an active heat engine to extract
work beyond the limits valid for a passive heat engine. To obtain a second law
expressed in terms of observable variables in the presence of hidden degrees of
freedom we introduce a coarse-grained excess entropy and prove a fluctuation
theorem for this quantity.

context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and was coined Quantum Spin Dynamics
(QSD). The Hamiltonian constraint of QSD was criticised as being too local and
to prevent ""propagation"" in canonical LQG. That criticism was based on an
algorithm developed for QSD for generating solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt
equations. The fine details of that algorithm could not be worked out because
the QSD Hamiltonian constraint makes crucial use of the volume operator which
cannot be diagonalised analytically.
  In this paper, we consider the U(1)$^3$ model for Euclidean vacuum LQG which
consists in replacing the structure group SU(2) by U(1)$^3$ and otherwise keeps
all properties of the SU(2) theory intact. This enables analytical calculations
and the fine details of the algorithm {\it can} be worked out.
  By considering one of the simplest possible non-trivial class of solutions
based on very small graphs, we show that 1. an infinite number of solutions
{\it exist} which are 2. generically {\it not normalisable} with respect to the
inner product on the space of spatially diffeomorphism invariant distributions
and 3. generically display {\it propagation}.
  Due to the closeness of the U(1)$^3$ model to Euclidean LQG, it is extremely
likely that all three properties hold also in the SU(2) case and even more so
in physical Lorentzian LQG. These arguments can in principle be made water
tight using modern numerical (e.g. ML or QC) methods combined with the

Detection and segmentation of nuclei are some of the essential steps in the

the domination numbers of $G$ and $H$. Recently Gaar, Krenn, Margulies and
Wiegele used the graph class $\mathcal{G}$ of all graphs with $n_\mathcal{G}$
vertices and domination number $k_\mathcal{G}$ and reformulated Vizing's
conjecture as the problem that for all graph classes $\mathcal{G}$ and
$\mathcal{H}$ the Vizing polynomial is sum-of-squares (SOS) modulo the Vizing
ideal. By solving semidefinite programs (SDPs) and clever guessing they derived
SOS-certificates for some values of $k_\mathcal{G}$, $n_\mathcal{G}$,
$k_\mathcal{H}$, and $n_\mathcal{H}$.
  In this paper, we consider their approach for $k_\mathcal{G} = k_\mathcal{H}

the Vizing ideal. Based on this, we deduce the minimum degree $(n_\mathcal{G} +

the first result of this kind. Furthermore, we present a method to find
certificates for graph classes $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ with
$n_\mathcal{G} + n_\mathcal{H} -1 = d$ for general $d$, which is again based on
solving SDPs, but does not depend on guessing and depends on much smaller SDPs.
We implement our new method in SageMath and give new SOS-certificates for all
graph classes $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ with
$k_\mathcal{G}=k_\mathcal{H}=1$ and $n_\mathcal{G} + n_\mathcal{H} \leq 15$.

spectral techniques. We develop a formal and numerical spectral analysis for
$U(1)$ symmetry-breaking quantum fluids suitable for analyzing turbulent flows,
with specific application to the Gross-Pitaevskii fluid. Our analysis builds

taking the cosine similarity between their image embeddings. Yet, such an
approach suffers from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to new
types of images (e.g., when a query face is masked, cropped, or rotated) not
included in the training set or the gallery. Here, we propose a re-ranking
approach that compares two faces using the Earth Mover's Distance on the deep,
spatial features of image patches. Our extra comparison stage explicitly
examines image similarity at a fine-grained level (e.g., eyes to eyes) and is
more robust to OOD perturbations and occlusions than traditional FI.
Interestingly, without finetuning feature extractors, our method consistently
improves the accuracy on all tested OOD queries: masked, cropped, rotated, and
adversarial while obtaining similar results on in-distribution images.

frozen into a persistently driven incompressible flow so that its
characteristic thickness gradually decreases in time. As the CS thins, the
strength of the reconnecting field increases, and adiabatic invariance in the
inflowing fluid elements produces a field-biased pressure anisotropy with
excess perpendicular pressure. At large plasma beta, this anisotropy excites
the mirror instability, which deforms the reconnecting field on ion-Larmor
scales and dramatically reduces the effective thickness of the CS. Tearing
modes whose wavelengths are comparable to that of the mirrors then become
unstable, triggering reconnection on smaller scales and at earlier times than
would have occurred if the thinning CS were to have retained its Harris
profile. A novel method for identifying and tracking X-points is introduced,
yielding X-point separations that are initially intermediate between the
perpendicular and parallel mirror wavelengths in the upstream plasma. These
mirror-stimulated tearing modes ultimately grow and merge to produce island
widths comparable to the CS thickness, an outcome we verify across a range of
CS formation timescales and initial CS widths. Our results may find their most
immediate application in the tearing disruption of magnetic folds generated by
turbulent dynamo in weakly collisional, high-beta, astrophysical plasmas.

principle, very general; it could be the power, the energy, the total bandwidth
allocated to the different qubits... However, we mainly focus on the energetic
cost of quantum computing. In particular, we develop an inter-disciplinary
approach that allows to minimize the resources required to implement algorithms
on quantum computers. By asking to find the minimum amount of resources
required to perform a computation under the constraint that the algorithm
provides a correct answer with a targeted accuracy, it is possible to optimize
the whole computer in order to minimize the resources spent, while being sure
to have a correct answer with a high probability. We apply this approach to a
complete model fault-tolerant quantum computer based on superconducting qubits.
Our results indicate that for algorithms implemented on thousands of logical
qubits, our method makes it possible to reduce the energetic cost by orders of
magnitudes in regimes where, without optimizing, the power consumption could be
close to the gigawatt. This work illustrates that the energetic cost of quantum
computing should be a criterion in itself, allowing to evaluate the scaling
potential of a given quantum computer technology. It also illustrates that
optimizing the architecture of a quantum computer, via inter-disciplinary
methods, including algorithms, error correction, qubit physics, engineering
aspects, such as the ones that we propose, can prove to be a powerful tool,
clearly improving the scaling potential of quantum computers. Finally, we
provide general hints about how to make fault-tolerant quantum computers energy

We reduce the 16 states to 4 states and derive the coarse-grained second law of

on the free energy transport by the multi-body information flow representing
the two-body or four-body correlations in the 16-state model by exploiting the
cycle decomposition. The coarse-grained information flow and the multi-body
information flows express the quantitative difference between secondary active

best low rank approximation problem. In contrast to hitherto existing
approaches, the approximation is based on a kind of spectral representation,

In this perspective, our approach is close to the original idea of Pearson

is performed for the particular case of a gradient bumblebee field at its

  Multi-Chip-Modules",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-Chip-Modules (MCMs) reduce the design and fabrication cost of machine
learning (ML) accelerators while delivering performance and energy efficiency
on par with a monolithic large chip. However, ML compilers targeting MCMs need
to solve complex optimization problems optimally and efficiently to achieve
this high performance. One such problem is the multi-chip partitioning problem
where compilers determine the optimal partitioning and placement of operations
in tensor computation graphs on chiplets in MCMs. Partitioning ML graphs for
MCMs is particularly hard as the search space grows exponentially with the
number of chiplets available and the number of nodes in the neural network.
Furthermore, the constraints imposed by the underlying hardware produce a
search space where valid solutions are extremely sparse. In this paper, we
present a strategy using a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework to emit a
possibly invalid candidate partition that is then corrected by a constraint
solver. Using the constraint solver ensures that RL encounters valid solutions
in the sparse space frequently enough to converge with fewer samples as
compared to non-learned strategies. The architectural choices we make for the
policy network allow us to generalize across different ML graphs. Our
evaluation of a production-scale model, BERT, on real hardware reveals that the
partitioning generated using RL policy achieves 6.11% and 5.85% higher
throughput than random search and simulated annealing. In addition, fine-tuning
the pre-trained RL policy reduces the search time from 3 hours to only 9
minutes, while achieving the same throughput as training RL policy from
scratch.

still rare. Here, a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model was constructed to
study the magnetic and electronic properties of the quasi-one-dimensional $n=6$

Specifically, introducing the Hubbard $U$ and Hund $J_{H}$ couplings and
studying the model via the density matrix renormalization group, we report the
ground-state phase diagram varying the electronic density away from $n=6$. For
the realistic Hund coupling $J_{H}/U = 1/4$, several electronic phases were
obtained, including a metal, orbital-selective Mott, and Mott insulating
phases. Doping away from the parent phase, the competition of many tendencies
leads to a variety of magnetic states, such as ferromagnetism, as well as
several antiferromagnetic and magnetic ""block"" phases. In the hole-doping
region, two different interesting orbital-selective Mott phases were found:
OSMP1 (with one localized orbital and two itinerant orbitals) and OSMP2 (with

distribution. Here, through the Page and Wootters mechanism, we show that time
and non-equilibrium dynamics can emerge as a consequence of the entanglement
between the system and the environment present in the (randomly chosen) global
wave-function of the Universe. The clock is provided by the environment, which
ticks the temporal evolution of S. The paradox of the peaceful coexistence of
statistical equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics is solved by identifying
the trace over the environment degrees of freedom with the temporal trace over
the entire history of the system S.

will be visible up to redshift $z\approx 20$ and even higher, thus facilitating
the understanding of the dark era of the Universe preceding the birth of the
first stars. The ET will therefore be a crucial instrument for population
studies. We analysed the compact binaries originating in stars from (i)
Population (Pop) I+II, (ii) Pop III, and (iii) globular clusters (GCs), with
the single ET instrument, using the ET-D design sensitivity for the analysis.
We estimated the constraints on the chirp mass, redshift, and merger rate as
function of redshift for these classes of compact object binaries. We conclude
that the ET as a single instrument is capable of detecting and distinguishing
different compact binary populations separated in chirp mass - redshift space.
While compact binaries originating in stars from Pop III are clearly
distinguishable, owing to the separation in chirp mass - redshift space, the
other two populations, Pop I+II, and GCs, can be distinguished with just 500
detections, corresponding to an observation time of $\sim 1$ hr. The mass
distribution characteristics of such different compact binary populations can
also be estimated with the single ET instrument.

phenomena, such as cavity-mediated transport that can potentially overcome the
Anderson localization. Yet, an accurate theoretical treatment is challenging as
the matter (e.g.,molecules) are subject to large energetic disorder. In this
article, we develop the Green's function solution to the Fano-Anderson model
and use the exact analytical solution to quantify the effects of energetic
disorder on the spectral and transport properties in microcavities. Starting
from microscopic equation of motions, we derive an effective non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian and predict a set of scaling laws: (i) The complex eigen-energies
of the effective Hamiltonian exhibit an exceptional point, which leads to
underdamped coherent dynamics in the weak disorder regime, where the decay rate
increases with disorder, and overdamped incoherent dynamics in the strong
disorder regime, where the slow decay rate decreases with disorder. (ii) The
total density of states of disordered ensembles can be exactly partitioned into
the cavity, bright-state and dark-state local density of states, which are
determined by the complex eigen solutions and can be measured via spectroscopy.
(iii) The cavity-mediated relaxation and transport dynamics are intimately
related such that the energy-resolved relaxation and transport rates are
proportional to the cavity local density of states. The ratio of the disorder
averaged relaxation and transport rates equals the molecule number, which can
be interpreted as a result of a quantum random walk. (iv) A turnover in the
rates as a function of disorder or molecule density can be explained in terms
of the overlap of the disorder distribution function and the cavity local
density of states. These findings reveal the significant impact of the dark
states on the transport properties of disordered ensembles in cavities.

processes, such as hydrodynamic or magnetic instabilities. Yet, it is not clear
to what extent the seismic inferences depend on the physics employed for the
stellar modelling or on the observational dataset. We investigate the
observational constraints which are necessary to provide accurate constraints
on the mixing processes in $\beta$ Cephei stars. We explore the importance of
the identification of the angular degree of modes. Depending on the quality of
the seismic dataset and the classical constraints, we estimate the precision
achievable with asteroseismology. We propose a method extending the forward
approach classically used to model $\beta$ Cephei stars The probability
distributions of the asteroseismic-derived stellar parameters are obtained.
With these distributions, we provide a systemic way to estimate the errors of
the modelling. A particular effort is made to also include the theoretical
uncertainties of the models. We then estimate the accuracy and precision of
asteroseismology for $\beta$ Cephei stars in a series of hare and hound
exercises. The exercises show that a set of four to five oscillation
frequencies with an identified angular degree already leads to accurate
inferences on the stellar parameters. Without the identification of the modes,
the addition of other classical observational constraints allow to succeed the
seismic modelling. When the micro-physics of the star and stellar models used
for the modelling differ, the constraints derived on the internal structure
remain valid if expressed in terms of acoustic variables. The characterisation
of the mixing processes at the boundary of the convective core remain

determine with an accuracy of at least $10^{-12}$ the value of the critical
amplitude for collapse to a black hole, as well as the values of the critical
and echoing exponents. Obtaining such high accuracy in the critical amplitude
requires us to do a coordinate radial transformation that effectively increases
resolution near the central regions by a factor of at least $10^3$. As
expected, we find that for the case of small coupling the critical behaviour is
very similar to that of a minimally coupled scalar field. On the other hand,
for high coupling the dynamics become so violent that we need to introduce a
special slicing condition, known as the shock-avoiding slicing condition, in
order to avoid gauge pathologies that would otherwise cause our simulations to
fail. With this new gauge condition we are able to perform high accuracy
simulations even in the strong coupling regime, where we find that the critical

behavior is richer and can not be modelled by a single harmonic.

in the measured $v_1$ slopes of light nuclei at mid-rapidity. For the measured
$v_2$ magnitude, a strong rapidity dependence is observed. Unlike $v_2$ at
higher collision energies, the $v_2$ values at mid-rapidity for all light

time-reversible deterministic microscopic dynamics is one of the key problems
in philosophy of physics. The Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism, which
is one of the most important methods of modern nonequilibrium statistical
mechanics, allows for a systematic derivation of irreversible transport
equations from reversible microdynamics and thus provides a useful framework
for understanding this issue. However, discussions of the Mori-Zwanzig
formalism in philosophy of physics tend to focus on simple variants rather than
on the more sophisticated ones used in modern physical research. In this work,
I will close this gap by studying the problems of probability and
irreversibility using the example of Grabert's time-dependent projection
operator formalism. This allows to give a more solid mathematical foundation to
various concepts from the philosophical literature, in particular Wallace's
simple dynamical conjecture and Robertson's theory of autonomous macrodynamics.
Moreover, I will explain how the Mori-Zwanzig formalism allows to resolve the
tension between epistemic and ontic approaches to probability in statistical
mechanics. Finally, I argue that the debate which interventionists and
coarse-grainers should really be having is related not to the question why
there is equilibration at all, but why it has the quantitative form it is found
to have in experiments.

Unmodified, Surgical, Tool-Obstructed Needles, a problem and algorithm that
uses a learned active sensing policy with a stereo camera to localize and align
the needle into a visible and accessible pose for the other arm. To compensate
for robot positioning and needle perception errors, the algorithm then executes
a high-precision grasping motion that uses multiple cameras. In physical
experiments using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), HOUSTON successfully passes
unmodified surgical needles with a success rate of 96.7% and is able to perform
handover sequentially between the arms 32.4 times on average before failure. On
needles unseen in training, HOUSTON achieves a success rate of 75 - 92.9%. To

an adaptive sensing strategy sequentially based on the observations made so
far. To tackle such a challenging problem in which the dimension of historical

another DNN to map the final LSTM state to the desired solution. We investigate
the performance of the proposed framework for adaptive channel sensing problems

However, many thiophosphate monolayers, i.e., analogs of CuInP$_2$S$_6$ and
referred to as ABP$_2$X$_6$, lose ferroelectricity and instead exhibit an
antiferroelectric (AFE) or paraelectric ordering. We propose to tune the AFE
ABP$_2$X$_6$ monolayers into the FE ordering through interface engineering. The
mechanism is that there are couplings between the charge polarizations of the
ABP$_2$X$_6$ monolayers and the local dipoles as well as the induced electronic
polarizations in the substrate which have a tendency to stabilize the FE
ordering. We further perform first-principles calculations for CuInP$_2$Se$_6$

that an AFE CuInP$_2$Se$_6$ monolayer becomes FE as interfaced with graphene,
MoS$_2$, and h-BN monolayers. In contrast, the CuCrP$_2$S$_6$ monolayer remains
AFE since there is a large energy difference between the AFE and FE phases.
Interfacing it with a MoTe$_2$ monolayer induces a metal-insulator transition
for the heterostructure, whereas interfacing with a polar surface MgO(111) can
drive it into FE. The interfacing effect can also be used to manipulate the FE
properties of ABP$_2$X$_6$ multilayers. We further find that the AFE-to-FE
transition is electrically switchable in these systems. In particular, it is
accompanied by an indirect-direct band-gap transition for the CuInP$_2$Se$_6$

simultaneously accounts for uncertainties in: (i) the intrinsic Ly$\alpha$
emission profile (reconstructed from a covariance matrix of measured emission
lines; extended in this work to include NV) and (ii) the distribution of
ionised (H\,{\scriptsize II}) regions within the IGM using a $1.6^3$ Gpc$^3$
reionisation simulation. This approach is complementary to that used in the
aforementioned works as it focuses solely redward of Ly$\alpha$ ($1218 <
\lambda < 1230$\AA) making it more robust to modelling uncertainties while also
using a different methodology for (i) and (ii). We find, for a fiducial EoR
morphology, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.64\substack{+0.19 \\ -0.23}$ (68 per cent) at
$z=7$ and $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.27\substack{+0.21 \\ -0.17}$ at $z=7.51$

slightly lower in amplitude. Following the inclusion of NV into our

cosmology we focus on the study of quantum decoherence of cosmological
perturbations in inflationary universe, that does not rely on any environment.
This is what `intrinsic' in the title refers to -- a closed quantum system. The
question is, does its quantum perturbations decohere with an inflationary
expansion of the universe. A dominant view which had propagated for a quarter
of a century asserts yes, based on the belief that the large squeezing of a
quantum state after a duration of inflation renders the system effectively
classical. This paper debunks this view by identifying the technical
fault-lines in its derivations and revealing the pitfalls in its arguments
which drew earlier authors to this wrong conclusion. We use a few simple
quantum mechanical models to expound where the fallacy originated: The highly
squeezed ellipse quadrature in phase space cannot be simplified to a line, and
the Wigner function cannot be replaced by a delta function. These amount to
taking only the leading order contributions in seeking the semiclassical limit
and ignoring the subdominant contributions where quantum features reside. Doing
so violates the bounds of the Wigner function, and its wave functions possess
negative eigenvalues. Moreover, the Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty relation
for a pure state is violated. For inflationary cosmological perturbations, in
addition to these features, entanglement exists between the created pairs. This
uniquely quantum feature cannot be easily argued away. Indeed it could be our
best hope to retroduce the quantum nature of cosmological perturbations and the
trace of an inflaton field. All this point to the fact that a closed quantum
system, even when highly squeezed, evolves unitarily without loss of coherence;
quantum cosmological perturbations do not by itself decohere.

that participants quickly adjusted their self-reported situational trust (SST)

analysis. To handle the rapid growth of network scale, in this work, we explore
the detection of hidden communities from the local perspective, and propose a
new method that detects and boosts each layer iteratively on a subgraph sampled
from the original network. We first expand the seed set from a single seed node
based on our modified local spectral method and detect an initial dominant
local community. Then we temporarily remove the members of this community as
well as their connections to other nodes, and detect all the neighborhood
communities in the remaining subgraph, including some ""broken communities"" that
only contain a fraction of members in the original network. The local community
and neighborhood communities form a dominant layer, and by reducing the edge
weights inside these communities, we weaken this layer's structure to reveal
the hidden layers. Eventually, we repeat the whole process and all communities
containing the seed node can be detected and boosted iteratively. We
theoretically show that our method can avoid some situations that a broken
community and the local community are regarded as one community in the
subgraph, leading to the inaccuracy on detection which can be caused by global
hidden community detection methods. Extensive experiments show that our method
could significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines designed for
either global hidden community detection or multiple local community detection.

power. Typically, a hypothesis is made on the form of the transmission rate

modeled due to the unknown dynamics of many influential factors. We tackle this
problem by using a hypothesis-free machine-learning algorithm to estimate the
transmission rate from data on non-pharmaceutical policies, and in turn
forecast the confirmed cases using a mechanistic disease model. More
specifically, we build a hybrid model consisting of a mechanistic ordinary

calibrate the parameters, we develop an ""inverse method"" that obtains the
transmission rate inversely in time from the other variables in the ODE model

future in the United States with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of
27%. Being partly data-driven, the method is more accurate than typical
mechanistic models and meanwhile more intuitive, and possibly reliable, than
purely data-based machine learning models. Moreover, it can identify the most

First, it distills semantic priors from a pretext model into a multi-scale

local structures. Within the prior learner, we present an optional module for
variational inference to realize probabilistic image inpainting driven by
various learned priors. The second component of SPN is a fully context-aware
image generator, which adaptively and progressively refines low-level visual
representations at multiple scales with the (stochastic) prior pyramid. We
train the prior learner and the image generator as a unified model without any

problem (dual to the original restriction formulation), we find that the $l^2$
decoupling theorem directly implies a local variant of the desired extension

obtain the best communication frequency. To obtain the best frequency, i.e.,
highest SNR, we design the frequency sweeping mechanism which can determine the
frequency of uplink and downlink communication before the transmitter and
receiver communicate. Due to the large-scale networks in industry, P-MAC can be
exploited to speed up the establishment of the Ad-Hoc PLC network. Finally, we
compare our mechanism with CSMA. Numerical results indicate that our strategy
greatly shortens the time of establishing the Ad-Hoc network.

We investigate the spatially resolved mass-metallicity relation (MZR) of galaxy

stellar mass surface density and the metallicity is consistent with the MZR at
the global scale. Methods: We investigate the relationship between the stellar
mass surface density and the metallicity abundance, 12+log (O/H), for
star-forming spaxels belonging to 298 galaxy pairs identified using visual and
kinematic indicators in the SDSS-MaNGA survey. We also investigate if a)the
location of a spaxel relative to the galaxy centre and b)the galaxy pair
separation have any effect on the local MZR. Results: We find that the
correlation between mass and metallicity holds for interacting galaxies at the
local level. However, we find two peaks in spaxel distribution, one peak with
enriched metallicity and the other with diluted metallicity. We find that the
spaxels belonging to the galaxy central regions (i.e. at lower R/Reff) are
concentrated close to the two peaks. We also find that the metallicity-diluted
spaxels belong to galaxy pairs with closer projected separations and that
spaxels with enriched metallicity belong to galaxy pairs with greater projected

MZR for star-forming spaxels that belong to galaxy pairs. The peaks are likely
related to the galaxy projected separation or the stage of the interaction

singular rescaling of the Schwarzschild's spacetime. The new exact solution,
which is asymptotically Anti-de Sitter, manifests an unattainable singularity
at infinity that can not be reached in finite proper time, namely, the
spacetime is geodetically complete. It deserves to be notice that we here think
different from the usual. Indeed, instead of making the metric
singularity-free, we make it apparently but harmlessly even more singular then
the Schwarzschild's one. Finally, it is crucial to point that the Weyl's
conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken to the new singular vacuum rather
then the asymptotically flat Schwarzschild's one. The metric, is unique
according to: the null energy condition, the zero acceleration for photons in
the Newtonian regime, and the homogeneity of the Universe at large scales. Once
the matter is conformally coupled to gravity, the orbital velocity for a probe
star in the galaxy turns out to be asymptotically constant consistently with
the observations and the Tully-Fisher relation. Therefore, we compare our model
with a sample of 175 galaxies and we show that our velocity profile very well
interpolates the galactic rotation-curves for a proper choice of the only free

YCo$_5$ with 56 full valance electrons is dynamically unstable and this
instability can be cured by reducing the number of electrons ($N_e$). Crystal
orbital Hamilton population analysis reveals that the observed phonon
instability originates from the large population of antibonding states near the
Fermi level, which is dominated by the Co atoms in the honeycomb layer. The
antibonding state depopulates with decreasing $N_e$, resulting in stable
phonons for hole-doped YCo$_5$ with $N_e$ $\leq$ 55. We then evaluate the
temperature-dependent MCA energy using both HLD and $ab$ $initio$ molecular
dynamics (AIMD) methods. For the pristine YCo$_5$, we observe a very weak
temperature decay of the MCA energy, indicating little effect of lattice
dynamics. Also, the MCA energies evaluated with AIMD at all target temperatures
are larger than that of the static hexagonal lattice at 0 K, which is mainly
attributed to the structural distortion driven by soft phonon modes. In the
hole-doped YCo$_5$, where the distortion is suppressed, a considerable
temperature decay in MCA energy is obtained both in HLD and AIMD methods,

conduction-electron spin density ${\bf s}$ in the adjacent metal layer, we
demonstrate that a sign reversal of the antiferromagnetic spin Seebeck effect
across the spin-flop transition occurs when the interfacial coupling of ${\bf
s}$ to the staggered magnetization ${\bf n}$ of the antiferromagnet dominates,
whereas no sign reversal appears when the interfacial coupling of ${\bf s}$ to
the magnetization ${\bf m}$ dominates. Moreover, we show that the sign reversal
is influenced by the degree of spin dephasing in the metal layer. Our result
indicates that the sign reversal is not a generic property of a simple uniaxial
antiferromagnet, but controlled by microscopic details of the exchange coupling
at the interface and the spin dephasing in the metal layer.

modern cosmology. Recent observations of the galaxy redshift survey provide
relevant data to confront the principle with observation. We present a
homogeneity test for the matter distribution using the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy
sample and clarify the ontological status of the CP. As a homogeneity
criterion, we compare the observed data with similarly constructed random
distributions using the number count in the truncated cones method. Comparisons
are also made with three theoretical results using the same method: (i) the
dark matter halo mock catalogs from the N-body simulation, (ii) the log-normal
distributions derived from the theoretical matter power spectrum, and (iii)
direct estimation from the theoretical power spectrum. We show that the
observed distribution is statistically impossible as a random distribution up
to 300 Mpc/h in radius, which is around the largest statistically available
scale. However, comparisons with the three theoretical results show that the
observed distribution is consistent with these theoretically derived results
based on the CP. We show that the observed galaxy distribution (light) and the
simulated dark matter distribution (matter) are quite inhomogeneous even on a
large scale. Here, we clarify that there is no inconsistency surrounding the
ontological status of the CP in cosmology. In practice, the CP is applied to
the metric and the metric fluctuation is extremely small in all cosmological
scales. This allows the CP to be valid as the averaged background in metric.
The matter fluctuation, however, is decoupled from the small nature of metric
fluctuation in the subhorizon scale. What is directly related to the matter in
Einstein's gravity is the curvature, a quadratic derivative of the metric.

source domain to an unlabeled target domain that follows different distribution
from the source. To achieve this, DA methods include a source classification
objective to extract the source knowledge and a domain alignment objective to
diminish the domain shift, ensuring knowledge transfer. Typically, former DA
methods adopt some weight hyper-parameters to linearly combine the training
objectives to form an overall objective. However, the gradient directions of
these objectives may conflict with each other due to domain shift. Under such
circumstances, the linear optimization scheme might decrease the overall
objective value at the expense of damaging one of the training objectives,
leading to restricted solutions. In this paper, we rethink the optimization
scheme for DA from a gradient-based perspective. We propose a Pareto Domain
Adaptation (ParetoDA) approach to control the overall optimization direction,
aiming to cooperatively optimize all training objectives. Specifically, to
reach a desirable solution on the target domain, we design a surrogate loss
mimicking target classification. To improve target-prediction accuracy to
support the mimicking, we propose a target-prediction refining mechanism which
exploits domain labels via Bayes' theorem. On the other hand, since prior
knowledge of weighting schemes for objectives is often unavailable to guide
optimization to approach the optimal solution on the target domain, we propose
a dynamic preference mechanism to dynamically guide our cooperative
optimization by the gradient of the surrogate loss on a held-out unlabeled

to discriminate the similarities and discrepancies across
instruction-trajectory pairs and ignore the temporal continuity of
sub-instructions. These problems hinder agents from learning distinctive
vision-and-language representations, harming the robustness and
generalizability of the navigation policy. In this paper, we propose a
Contrastive Instruction-Trajectory Learning (CITL) framework that explores
invariance across similar data samples and variance across different ones to
learn distinctive representations for robust navigation. Specifically, we
propose: (1) a coarse-grained contrastive learning objective to enhance
vision-and-language representations by contrasting semantics of full trajectory
observations and instructions, respectively; (2) a fine-grained contrastive
learning objective to perceive instructions by leveraging the temporal
information of the sub-instructions; (3) a pairwise sample-reweighting
mechanism for contrastive learning to mine hard samples and hence mitigate the
influence of data sampling bias in contrastive learning. Our CITL can be easily
integrated with VLN backbones to form a new learning paradigm and achieve
better generalizability in unseen environments. Extensive experiments show that
the model with CITL surpasses the previous state-of-the-art methods on R2R,

evaluation methodology for generation tasks, with new questions raised about
the validity of automatic metrics and of crowdworker judgments. Meanwhile,
efforts to improve generation models tend to depend on simple n-gram overlap
metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE). We argue that new advances on models and metrics
should each more directly benefit and inform the other. We therefore propose a
generalization of leaderboards, bidimensional leaderboards (Billboards), that
simultaneously tracks progress in language generation models and metrics for
their evaluation. Unlike conventional unidimensional leaderboards that sort
submitted systems by predetermined metrics, a Billboard accepts both generators
and evaluation metrics as competing entries. A Billboard automatically creates
an ensemble metric that selects and linearly combines a few metrics based on a
global analysis across generators. Further, metrics are ranked based on their
correlation with human judgments. We release four Billboards for machine
translation, summarization, and image captioning. We demonstrate that a linear
ensemble of a few diverse metrics sometimes substantially outperforms existing
metrics in isolation. Our mixed-effects model analysis shows that most
automatic metrics, especially the reference-based ones, overrate machine over
human generation, demonstrating the importance of updating metrics as
generation models become stronger (and perhaps more similar to humans) in the
future. Our project website is available at

stars. We estimated the mass accretion rate during the dimming phase to be
$\dot{M} = 3-8 \times 10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, higher than typical T Tauri

organisms from different kingdoms and phyla to improve the mechanical
properties of their high Mg calcite skeletons. We show that such phase
separation and the formation of high-Mg nanoparticles are achieved through
spinodal decomposition of an amorphous Mg calcite precursor. Such decomposition
is independent of the biological characteristics of the studied organisms
belonging to different phyla and even kingdoms, but rather originates from
their similar chemical composition and a specific Mg content within their
skeletons, which generally ranges from 14 to 48 mol percent of Mg. We show
evidence of high Mg calcite nanoparticles in the cases of 6 biologically
different organisms all demonstrating more than 14 mol percent Mg calcite, and
consider it likely that this phenomenon is immeasurably more prevalent in
nature. We also establish the absence of these high Mg nanoparticles in
organisms whose Mg content is lower than 14 mol percent, providing further
evidence that whether or not spinodal decomposition of an amorphous Mg calcite
precursor takes place is determined by the amount of Mg it contains. The
valuable knowledge gained from this biostrategy significantly impacts the
understanding of how biominerals, though comprised of intrinsically brittle
materials, can effectively resist fracture.

  https://wanquanf.github.io/NeuralPoints.html",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose Neural Points, a novel point cloud representation
and apply it to the arbitrary-factored upsampling task. Different from
traditional point cloud representation where each point only represents a
position or a local plane in the 3D space, each point in Neural Points
represents a local continuous geometric shape via neural fields. Therefore,
Neural Points contain more shape information and thus have a stronger
representation ability. Neural Points is trained with surface containing rich
geometric details, such that the trained model has enough expression ability
for various shapes. Specifically, we extract deep local features on the points
and construct neural fields through the local isomorphism between the 2D
parametric domain and the 3D local patch. In the final, local neural fields are
integrated together to form the global surface. Experimental results show that
Neural Points has powerful representation ability and demonstrate excellent
robustness and generalization ability. With Neural Points, we can resample
point cloud with arbitrary resolutions, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art
point cloud upsampling methods. Code is available at

science. Current detections for it are mostly indirect. The spacetime effects
of dark energy can be locally described by the SdSw metric. Understanding these
local effects exactly is an essential step towards the direct probe of dark
energy. From first principles, we prove that dark energy can exert a repulsive
dark force on astrophysical scales, different from the Newtonian attraction of
both visible and dark matter. One way of measuring local effects of dark energy
is through the gravitational deflection of light. We geometrize the bending of
light in any curved static spacetime. First of all, we define a generalized
deflection angle, referred to as the Gaussian deflection angle, in a
mathematically strict and conceptually clean way. Basing on the Gauss-Bonnet
theorem, we then prove that the Gaussian deflection angle is equivalent to the
surface integral of the Gaussian curvature over a chosen lensing patch. As an
application of the geometrization, we study the problem of whether dark energy
affects the bending of light and provide a strict solution to this problem in
the SdSw spacetime. According to this solution, we propose a method to overcome
the difficulty of measuring local dark energy effects. Exactly speaking, we
find that the lensing effect of dark energy can be enhanced by 14 orders of
magnitude when properly choosing the lensing patch in certain cases. It means
that we can probe the existence and nature of dark energy directly in our Solar
System. This points to an exciting direction to help unraveling the great
mystery of dark energy.

admissible) if no other model carries less risk for at least one state of
nature while presenting no more risk for others. How can you rationally
aggregate/combine a finite set of Pareto optimal models while preserving Pareto
efficiency? This question is nontrivial because weighted model averaging does
not, in general, preserve Pareto efficiency. This paper presents an answer in
four logical steps: (1) A rational aggregation rule should preserve Pareto
efficiency (2) Due to the complete class theorem, Pareto optimal models must be
Bayesian, i.e., they minimize a risk where the true state of nature is averaged
with respect to some prior. Therefore each Pareto optimal model can be
associated with a prior, and Pareto efficiency can be maintained by aggregating
Pareto optimal models through their priors. (3) A prior can be interpreted as a
preference ranking over models: prior $\pi$ prefers model A over model B if the
average risk of A is lower than the average risk of B. (4) A
rational/consistent aggregation rule should preserve this preference ranking:
If both priors $\pi$ and $\pi'$ prefer model A over model B, then the prior
obtained by aggregating $\pi$ and $\pi'$ must also prefer A over B. Under these
four steps, we show that all rational/consistent aggregation rules are as
follows: Give each individual Pareto optimal model a weight, introduce a weak
order/ranking over the set of Pareto optimal models, aggregate a finite set of
models S as the model associated with the prior obtained as the weighted
average of the priors of the highest-ranked models in S. This result shows that
all rational/consistent aggregation rules must follow a generalization of
hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Following our main result, we present
applications to Kernel smoothing, time-depreciating models, and voting
mechanisms.

This is the case even when the DNNs are architected to capture long-range

introduced `transformers' design. By contrast, we find that recurrent
architectures are capable of learning to perceive symmetry by decomposing the
long-range spatial dependencies into a sequence of local operations, that are
reusable for novel images. These results suggest that recurrent connections
likely play an important role in symmetry perception in artificial systems, and

where assessing the quality of a single generated image is crucial, these
metrics are not applicable. In this paper, we propose a general learning-based
framework, Reference-guided Image Synthesis Assessment (RISA) to quantitatively
evaluate the quality of a single generated image. Notably, the training of RISA
does not require human annotations. In specific, the training data for RISA are
acquired by the intermediate models from the training procedure in RIS, and
weakly annotated by the number of models' iterations, based on the positive
correlation between image quality and iterations. As this annotation is too
coarse as a supervision signal, we introduce two techniques: 1) a pixel-wise
interpolation scheme to refine the coarse labels, and 2) multiple binary
classifiers to replace a na\""ive regressor. In addition, an unsupervised
contrastive loss is introduced to effectively capture the style similarity
between a generated image and its reference image. Empirical results on various

which makes it possible to compute the length of a path by adding up the
individual edge weights. Yet, graphs with scalar edge weights are severely
limited in their expressivity, since oftentimes edges are used to encode
significantly more complex interrelations. In this work we compensate for this
modelling limitation and introduce the novel graph-theoretic concept of a
shortest path in a graph with matrix-valued edges. To this end, we define a
meaningful way for quantifying the path length for matrix-valued edges, and we
propose a simple yet effective algorithm to compute the respective shortest
path. While our formalism is universal and thus applicable to a wide range of
settings in vision, graphics and beyond, we focus on demonstrating its merits

and spectral deferred correction (SDC) time-integration methods up to order six
for incompressible Navier-Stokes problems in conjunction with a high-order
discontinuous Galerkin method for space discretization. It is proposed to
harness the implicit and explicit RK parts as a partitioned scheme, which
provides a natural basis for the underlying projection scheme and yields a
straight-forward approach for accommodating nonlinear viscosity. Numerical
experiments on laminar flow, variable viscosity and transition to turbulence
are carried out to assess accuracy, convergence and computational efficiency.
Although the methods of order 3 or higher are susceptible to order reduction
due to time-dependent boundary conditions, two third-order RK methods are
identified that perform well in all test cases and clearly surpass all
second-order schemes including the popular extrapolated backward difference
method. The considered SDC methods are more accurate than the RK methods, but
become competitive only for relative errors smaller than ca $10^{-5}$.

considered poor in modeling the irregular skeleton topology. To alleviate this
limitation, we propose a pure CNN architecture named Topology-aware CNN
(Ta-CNN) in this paper. In particular, we develop a novel cross-channel feature
augmentation module, which is a combo of map-attend-group-map operations. By
applying the module to the coordinate level and the joint level subsequently,
the topology feature is effectively enhanced. Notably, we theoretically prove
that graph convolution is a special case of normal convolution when the joint
dimension is treated as channels. This confirms that the topology modeling
power of GCNs can also be implemented by using a CNN. Moreover, we creatively
design a SkeletonMix strategy which mixes two persons in a unique manner and
further boosts the performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on four
widely used datasets, i.e. N-UCLA, SBU, NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 to verify

cross section. We first briefly illustrate how the WIMP dark matter halo
profile changes for the velocity suppressed p-wave annihilation scenarios,
compared with the familiar s-wave annihilation scenarios, and then discuss the
PBH mass dependent upper bound on the allowed PBH dark matter abundance. The
WIMPs can accrete onto a PBH to form an ultracompact minihalo with a spiky
density profile. Such a spike is moderated in the central region of a halo
because the WIMPs are annihilated away and this moderation is less effective
for a smaller annihilation cross section. The WIMP core density becomes larger
while the core radius becomes smaller for a velocity suppressed p-wave
annihilation cross section than those for the s-wave annihilation scenarios.
The annihilation cross section is dependent on the velocity which varies across
the halo, and, in addition to the change of the WIMP density profile, another
interesting feature is the PBH mass dependent bound on PBH dark matter
abundance. This is in stark contrast to the s-wave annihilation scenarios where
the PBH abundance bound is independent of the PBH mass. The allowed PBH dark
matter fraction (with respect to the total dark matter abundance) is of order
$f_{PBH}\lesssim {\cal

samples outside of a predetermined distribution. An anomaly detection pipeline
is comprised of two main stages: (1) feature extraction and (2) normality score
assignment. Recent papers used pre-trained networks for feature extraction
achieving state-of-the-art results. However, the use of pre-trained networks
does not fully-utilize the normal samples that are available at train time.
This paper suggests taking advantage of this information by using
teacher-student training. In our setting, a pretrained teacher network is used
to train a student network on the normal training samples. Since the student
network is trained only on normal samples, it is expected to deviate from the
teacher network in abnormal cases. This difference can serve as a complementary
representation to the pre-trained feature vector. Our method -- Transformaly --
exploits a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract both feature
vectors: the pre-trained (agnostic) features and the teacher-student
(fine-tuned) features. We report state-of-the-art AUROC results in both the
common unimodal setting, where one class is considered normal and the rest are
considered abnormal, and the multimodal setting, where all classes but one are
considered normal, and just one class is considered abnormal. The code is

Estimators (PE) in Yu et al.(2022), which was proposed from the perspective of
simultaneous reduction of the dimensionality and the magnitudes of the
idiosyncratic error matrix. In other word, we provide a least-square
interpretation of the PE for matrix factor model, which parallels to the
least-square interpretation of the PCA for the vector factor model. We derive
the convergence rates of the theoretical minimizers under sub-Gaussian tails.
Considering the robustness to the heavy tails of the idiosyncratic errors, we
extend the least squares to minimizing the Huber loss function, which leads to
a weighted iterative projection approach to compute and learn the parameters.
We also derive the convergence rates of the theoretical minimizers of the Huber
loss function under bounded $(2+\epsilon)$th moment of the idiosyncratic
errors. We conduct extensive numerical studies to investigate the empirical
performance of the proposed Huber estimators relative to the state-of-the-art

when the data are heavy-tailed, and as a result can be used as a safe
replacement in practice. An application to a Fama-French financial portfolio

subclass of combinatorial optimization problems, where information and controls
are distributed among multiple autonomous agents. Previously, Machine Learning
(ML) has been largely applied to solve combinatorial optimization problems by
learning effective heuristics. However, existing ML-based heuristic methods are
often not generalizable to different search algorithms. Most importantly, these
methods usually require full knowledge about the problems to be solved, which
are not suitable for distributed settings where centralization is not realistic
due to geographical limitations or privacy concerns. To address the generality
issue, we propose a novel directed acyclic graph representation schema for
DCOPs and leverage the Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to embed graph
representations. Our model, GAT-PCM, is then pretrained with optimally labelled
data in an offline manner, so as to construct effective heuristics to boost a
broad range of DCOP algorithms where evaluating the quality of a partial
assignment is critical, such as local search or backtracking search.
Furthermore, to enable decentralized model inference, we propose a distributed
embedding schema of GAT-PCM where each agent exchanges only embedded vectors,
and show its soundness and complexity. Finally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model by combining it with a local search or a
backtracking search algorithm. Extensive empirical evaluations indicate that
the GAT-PCM-boosted algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art

researchers have come up with RF lens-based hybrid beamforming. The use of
mmWave systems, however, causes an increase in bandwidth, which gives rise to
the beam squint phenomenon. We first find the causative factors for beam squint

dynamics of the so-called `weak' and `strong chaos' spreading regimes [2010,
EPL 91 30001], for which Anderson localization is destroyed. Based on the fact
that large variations of the fundamental frequencies denote strong chaotic
behavior, we show that in both regimes chaos is more intense at the central
regions of the wave packet, where also the energy content is higher, while the
oscillators at the wave packet's edges exhibit regular motion up until the time
they gain enough energy to become part of the highly excited portion of the
wave packet. Eventually, the percentage of chaotic oscillators remains
practically constant, despite the fact that the number of excited sites grows
as the wave packet spreads, but the portion of highly chaotic sites decreases
in time. We show that the extent of the zones of regular motion at the edges of
the wave packet in the strong chaos regime is much smaller than in the weak
chaos case. Furthermore, we find that in the strong chaos regime the chaotic
component of the wave packet is not only more extended than in the weak chaos
one, but in addition the fraction of strongly chaotic oscillators is much
higher. Another important difference between the weak and strong chaos regimes
is that in the latter case a significantly larger number of frequencies is
excited, even from the first stages of the evolution. Moreover, our
computations confirmed the shifting of fundamental frequencies outside the
normal mode frequency band of the linear system in the case of the so-called

propose a novel parallelizable algorithm for computing the global conformal and
quasi-conformal parameterization of multiply-connected surfaces onto a 2D

several subdomains and compute the free-boundary conformal or quasi-conformal

iteration together with the geodesic algorithm to the boundary points and
welding paths before and after the global welding to transform all the

problems. First, the form and the parameters of the kernel function are usually
selected blindly, depending seriously on trial-and-error. As a result, there
may be serious performance degradation in case of inappropriate selections.
Second, at the online monitoring stage, KPCA has much computational burden and
poor real-time performance, because the kernel method requires to leverage all
the offline training data. In this work, to deal with the two drawbacks, a
learnable faster realization of the conventional KPCA is proposed. The core
idea is to parameterize all feasible kernel functions using the novel nonlinear
DAE-FE (deep autoencoder based feature extraction) framework and propose
DAE-PCA (deep autoencoder based principal component analysis) approach in
detail. The proposed DAE-PCA method is proved to be equivalent to KPCA but has
more advantage in terms of automatic searching of the most suitable nonlinear
high-dimensional space according to the inputs. Furthermore, the online
computational efficiency improves by approximately 100 times compared with the
conventional KPCA. With the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process benchmark, the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method is illustrated.

distillation. As a train-time-only component, VIRT could completely maintain
the high efficiency of the Siamese structure and brings no extra computation

further design a VIRT-adapted interaction strategy. Experimental results on
multiple text matching datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art representation-based models. What's more, VIRT can be easily
integrated into existing representation-based methods to achieve further
improvements.

using the PLUTO code, of a microquasar scenario in which a strong weakly
relativistic wind from a star interacts with a relativistic jet under the
effect of the binary orbital motion. The parameters of the orbit are chosen
such that the results can provide insight on the jet-wind interaction in
compact systems like for instance Cyg~X-1 or Cyg~X-3. The wind and jet momentum
rates are set to values that may be realistic for these sources and lead to
moderate jet bending, which together with the close orbit and jet instabilities
could trigger significant jet precession and disruption. For high-mass
microquasars with orbit size $a\sim 0.1$~AU, and (relativistic) jet power
$L_j\sim 10^{37}(\dot M_w/10^{-6}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1})$~erg~s$^{-1}$,
where $\dot M_w$ is the stellar wind mass rate, the combined effects of the
stellar wind and orbital motion can induce relativistic jet disruption on
scales $\sim 1$~AU.

mapping pose and shape parameters to body meshes. This has been shown to
facilitate inferring 3D human pose and shape from images via different learning
models. However, not all pose and shape parameter values yield
physically-plausible or even realistic body meshes. In other words, SMPL is
under-constrained and may thus lead to invalid results when used to reconstruct
humans from images, either by directly optimizing its parameters, or by
learning a mapping from the image to these parameters.
  In this paper, we therefore learn a prior that restricts the SMPL parameters
to values that produce realistic poses via adversarial training. We show that
our learned prior covers the diversity of the real-data distribution,
facilitates optimization for 3D reconstruction from 2D keypoints, and yields
better pose estimates when used for regression from images. We found that the
prior based on spherical distribution gets the best results. Furthermore, in
all these tasks, it outperforms the state-of-the-art VAE-based approach to
constraining the SMPL parameters.

in 3-D reconstruction in dense urban areas using high-resolution SAR

considered as the state of the art in super-resolving TomoSAR, in particular in
the single look case. This superior performance comes at the cost of extra

solved analytically and we need to employ computationally expensive iterative
solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based super-resolving
TomoSAR inversion approach, $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-Net, to tackle this
challenge. $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-Net adopts advanced complex-valued learned
iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (CV-LISTA) to mimic the iterative
optimization step in sparse reconstruction. Simulations show the height
estimate from a well-trained $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-Net approaches the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound while improving the computational efficiency by 1 to 2
orders of magnitude comparing to the first-order CS-based methods. It also
shows no degradation in the super-resolution power comparing to the
state-of-the-art second-order TomoSAR solvers, which are much more
computationally expensive than the first-order methods. Specifically,
$\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-Net reaches more than $90\%$ detection rate in moderate
super-resolving cases at 25 measurements at 6dB SNR. Moreover, simulation at
limited baselines demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
second-order CS-based method by a fair margin. Test on real TerraSAR-X data
with just 6 interferograms also shows high-quality 3-D reconstruction with
high-density detected double scatterers.

the versatility and precision of humans. For example, when playing table
tennis, a robot should be capable of returning the ball in various ways while
precisely placing it at the desired location. A common approach to model such
versatile behavior is to use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, where each
expert is a contextual motion primitive. However, learning such MoEs is
challenging as most objectives force the model to cover the entire context
space, which prevents specialization of the primitives resulting in rather
low-quality components. Starting from maximum entropy reinforcement learning
(RL), we decompose the objective into optimizing an individual lower bound per
mixture component. Further, we introduce a curriculum by allowing the
components to focus on a local context region, enabling the model to learn
highly accurate skill representations. To this end, we use local context
distributions that are adapted jointly with the expert primitives. Our lower
bound advocates an iterative addition of new components, where new components
will concentrate on local context regions not covered by the current MoE. This
local and incremental learning results in a modular MoE model of high accuracy
and versatility, where both properties can be scaled by adding more components
on the fly. We demonstrate this by an extensive ablation and on two challenging

networks or visual transformers as the feature extractor, which is extremely
computationally expensive. In fact, real-world scenarios of fine-grained
recognition often require a more lightweight mobile network that can be
utilized offline. However, the fundamental mobile network feature extraction
capability is weaker than large-scale models. In this paper, based on the
lightweight MobilenetV2, we propose a Progressive Multi-Stage Interactive
training method with a Recursive Mosaic Generator (RMG-PMSI). First, we propose
a Recursive Mosaic Generator (RMG) that generates images with different
granularities in different phases. Then, the features of different stages pass
through a Multi-Stage Interaction (MSI) module, which strengthens and
complements the corresponding features of different stages. Finally, using the
progressive training (P), the features extracted by the model in different
stages can be fully utilized and fused with each other. Experiments on three
prestigious fine-grained benchmarks show that RMG-PMSI can significantly
improve the performance with good robustness and transferability.

significance has attracted growing researchers' interest in recent years.
However, the existing sign language translation methods need to read all the
videos before starting the translation, which leads to a high inference latency
and also limits their application in real-life scenarios. To solve this
problem, we propose SimulSLT, the first end-to-end simultaneous sign language
translation model, which can translate sign language videos into target text
concurrently. SimulSLT is composed of a text decoder, a boundary predictor, and
a masked encoder. We 1) use the wait-k strategy for simultaneous translation.
2) design a novel boundary predictor based on the integrate-and-fire module to
output the gloss boundary, which is used to model the correspondence between
the sign language video and the gloss. 3) propose an innovative re-encode
method to help the model obtain more abundant contextual information, which
allows the existing video features to interact fully. The experimental results
conducted on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset show that SimulSLT achieves
BLEU scores that exceed the latest end-to-end non-simultaneous sign language

schemes of quantum key distribution (QKD) as in contrast to classical
cryptography, quantum cryptography can provide unconditional security. However,
a successful implementation of a scheme of QKD requires identity authentication
as a prerequisite. A security loophole in the identity authentication scheme
may lead to the vulnerability of the entire secure communication scheme.
Consequently, identity authentication is extremely important and in the last
three decades several schemes for identity authentication, using quantum
resources have been proposed. The chronological development of these protocols,
which are now referred to as quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols,
are briefly reviewed here with specific attention to the causal connection
involved in their development. The existing protocols are classified on the
basis of the required quantum resources and their relative merits and demerits
are analyzed. Further, in the process of the classification of the protocols
for QIA, it's observed that the existing protocols can also be classified in a
few groups based on the inherent computational tasks used to design the
protocols. Realization of these symmetries has led to the possibility of
designing a set of new protocols for quantum identity authentication, which are
based on the existing schemes of the secure computational and communication
tasks. The security of such protocols is also critically analyzed.

been a key driver of e-commerce transactions in the past decade. Unfortunately,
this has also given rise to cybercriminals and fraudsters who are constantly
looking for vulnerabilities in these systems by deploying increasingly
sophisticated fraud attacks. A typical fraud detection system employs standard
supervised learning methods where the focus is on maximizing the fraud recall
rate. However, we argue that such a formulation can lead to sub-optimal
solutions. The design requirements for these fraud models requires that they
are robust to the high-class imbalance in the data, adaptive to changes in
fraud patterns, maintain a balance between the fraud rate and the decline rate
to maximize revenue, and be amenable to asynchronous feedback since usually
there is a significant lag between the transaction and the fraud realization.
To achieve this, we formulate fraud detection as a sequential decision-making
problem by including the utility maximization within the model in the form of
the reward function. The historical decline rate and fraud rate define the
state of the system with a binary action space composed of approving or
declining the transaction. In this study, we primarily focus on utility
maximization and explore different reward functions to this end. The
performance of the proposed Reinforcement Learning system has been evaluated
for two publicly available fraud datasets using Deep Q-learning and compared
with different classifiers. We aim to address the rest of the issues in future
work.

superconductors is a hallmark example of a quantum phase transition. Despite
being observed more than 30 years ago, its nature is still under a vivid
debate. One intriguing observations concerns the insulating side of the
transition, which exhibits some unusual properties. Among them is its
current-voltage relation ($I-V$ curve), which includes (1) a conductance that
changes abruptly by several orders of magnitude with increasing voltage, (2)
hysteretic behavior, and (3) multiple (sometimes more than a hundred) smaller
current jumps near the transition. Some models have been suggested before, but
no model has been successful in accounting for the observed behavior in full.
One commonly used approach is to model the disordered sample as a
two-dimensional array of conducting islands, where charge carriers tunnel from
one island to its neighbors. In those models, fast relaxation is assumed, and
the system is treated as always being in electrostatic and thermal equilibrium.
Those models are successful in explaining some measurement results, including
the phase transition itself, but fail to reproduce hysteresis in their
predicted $I-V$ curves. Here, we suggest incorporating finite relaxation time
into an array model. We show that, in the slow relaxation limit, our model can
reproduce hysteresis and multiple jumps in the $I-V$ curve. Based on our
results we argue that a similar behavior should be also observed in
two-dimensional normal (non-superconducting) arrays. This claim is supported by
past observations. We analyse the role of different parameters in our model,
determine the range of relevant time scale in the problem, and compare our
results with selected measurements.

advantageous to the deterministic case but has an inherently acyclic structure.
Here, we establish a correspondence between random dynamical decoupling and the
quantum Zeno effect by investigating the average over random decoupling
evolutions. This protocol is a manifestation of the quantum Zeno dynamics and
leads to a unitary bath evolution. By providing a framework that we call
equitability of system and bath, we show that the system dynamics under random

reveals a unification of the random dynamical decoupling and the quantum Zeno

challenging because production performance is dominated by a complex
interaction among a series of geological and engineering factors. In this
study, we propose a hybrid data-driven procedure for analyzing shale gas
production performance, which consists of a complete workflow for dominant
factor analysis, production forecast, and development optimization. More
specifically, game theory and machine learning models are coupled to determine
the dominating geological and engineering factors. The Shapley value with
definite physical meanings is employed to quantitatively measure the effects of
individual factors. A multi-model-fused stacked model is trained for production
forecast, on the basis of which derivative-free optimization algorithms are
introduced to optimize the development plan. The complete workflow is validated
with actual production data collected from the Fuling shale gas field, Sichuan
Basin, China. The validation results show that the proposed procedure can draw
rigorous conclusions with quantified evidence and thereby provide specific and
reliable suggestions for development plan optimization. Comparing with

emergence of universality at small time scales. On the other hand, we find
those models to disagree on the overall strength of the impact function by a

market reacts sub-linearly to the signed order flow, to a low-frequency regime

reconcile results from the literature on market microstructure (sub-linearity

models' stochastic geometric random current representation. It yields intuitive
explanations as well as tools for proving a range of dimension dependent
results, including: the emergence in $2D$ of Fermionic degrees of freedom, the
non-gaussianity of the scaling limits in two dimensions, and conversely the
emergence of Gaussian behavior in four and higher dimensions. To cover the
marginal case of $4D$ the tree diagram bound which has sufficed for higher

difficulty to find sufficient amount of feature correspondences under evolving
landscapes. In this research, we present a fully automatic approach to
detecting feature correspondences between historical images taken at different
times (i.e., inter-epoch), without auxiliary data required. Based on relative
orientations computed within the same epoch (i.e., intra-epoch), we obtain DSMs
(Digital Surface Model) and incorporate them in a rough-to-precise matching.
The method consists of: (1) an inter-epoch DSMs matching to roughly co-register
the orientations and DSMs (i.e, the 3D Helmert transformation), followed by (2)
a precise inter-epoch feature matching using the original RGB images. The
innate ambiguity of the latter is largely alleviated by narrowing down the
search space using the co-registered data. With the inter-epoch features, we
refine the image orientations and quantitatively evaluate the results (1) with
DoD (Difference of DSMs), (2) with ground check points, and (3) by quantifying
ground displacement due to an earthquake. We demonstrate that our method: (1)
can automatically georeference diachronic historical images; (2) can
effectively mitigate systematic errors induced by poorly estimated camera
parameters; (3) is robust to drastic scene changes. Compared to the
state-of-the-art, our method improves the image georeferencing accuracy by a

dilution range, showing a weakening of the insulating state but not of the
magnetic order. At $x \leq 0.7$, $T^*$ and $T_N$ coincide and are suppressed
together with further increase in site-dilution. Finally, the system loses the
magnetic order and the insulating state for $x=0.15$, significantly below the
classical percolation threshold $x_p^{sc} (\sim 0.31$). We show that the
induced moments on $U=0$ sites drive the magnetic order below the classical

security concerns, federated learning has attracted increasing attention from
both academia and industry to securely construct AI models across multiple
isolated data providers. In this paper, we studied the efficiency problem of
adapting widely used XGBoost model in real-world applications to vertical
federated learning setting. State-of-the-art vertical federated XGBoost
frameworks requires large number of encryption operations and ciphertext
transmissions, which makes the model training much less efficient than training
XGBoost models locally. To bridge this gap, we proposed a novel batch
homomorphic encryption method to cut the cost of encryption-related computation
and transmission in nearly half. This is achieved by encoding the first-order
derivative and the second-order derivative into a single number for encryption,
ciphertext transmission, and homomorphic addition operations. The sum of
multiple first-order derivatives and second-order derivatives can be
simultaneously decoded from the sum of encoded values. We are motivated by the
batch idea in the work of BatchCrypt for horizontal federated learning, and
design a novel batch method to address the limitations of allowing quite few
number of negative numbers. The encode procedure of the proposed batch method
consists of four steps, including shifting, truncating, quantizing and
batching, while the decoding procedure consists of de-quantization and shifting
back. The advantages of our method are demonstrated through theoretical

this paper, we first propose an AI-powered mobile network architecture and
discuss challenges in terms of cognition complexity, decisions with
high-dimensional action space, and self-adaption to system dynamics. Then,
potential solutions that are associated with AI are discussed. Finally, we
propose a deep learning approach that directly maps the state of MN to

mostly focused on optimizing their reconstruction performance. This work
investigates INRs from a novel perspective, i.e., as a tool for image

pipeline based on INRs including quantization, quantization-aware retraining
and entropy coding. Encoding with INRs, i.e. overfitting to a data sample, is
typically orders of magnitude slower. To mitigate this drawback, we leverage
meta-learned initializations based on MAML to reach the encoding in fewer
gradient updates which also generally improves rate-distortion performance of
INRs. We find that our approach to source compression with INRs vastly
outperforms similar prior work, is competitive with common compression
algorithms designed specifically for images and closes the gap to
state-of-the-art learned approaches based on Rate-Distortion Autoencoders.
Moreover, we provide an extensive ablation study on the importance of

Nishimoto and Tabei described a new, simple and constant-time implementation.
For a permutation $\pi$, it stores an $O (r)$-space table -- where $r$ is the
number of positions $i$ where either $i = 0$ or $\pi (i + 1) \neq \pi (i) + 1$
-- that enables the computation of successive values of $\pi(i)$ by table

number of rows in the table to bound the length of the linear scans such that
the query time for computing $\pi(i)$ is constant while maintaining $O
(r)$-space.
  In this paper we refine Nishimoto and Tabei's approach, including a
time-space tradeoff, and experimentally evaluate different implementations
demonstrating the practicality of part of their result. We show that even
without adding rows to the table, in practice we almost always scan only a few
entries during queries. We propose a decomposition scheme of the permutation
$\pi$ corresponding to the LF-mapping that allows an improved compression of
the data structure, while limiting the query time. We tested our implementation
on real-world genomic datasets and found that without compression of the table,
backward-stepping is drastically faster than with sparse bitvector
implementations but, unfortunately, also uses drastically more space. After
compression, backward-stepping is competitive both in time and space with the
best existing implementations.

consequence of bimodal state distributions. By using artificial random models,
we demonstrated that this phenomenology could be associated with community

controlling the number of bridges between two communities with different
densities. The introduction of bridges destroys multistability but creates an
intermittent behavior. Furthermore, we provide an analytical formulation

However, fog, as a kind of common weather, frequently appears in the real
world, especially in the mountain areas, making it difficult to accurately
observe the surrounding environments. Therefore, precisely estimating the
visibility under foggy weather can significantly benefit traffic management and
safety. To address this, most current methods use professional instruments
outfitted at fixed locations on the roads to perform the visibility
measurement; these methods are expensive and less flexible. In this paper, we
propose an innovative end-to-end convolutional neural network framework to
estimate the visibility leveraging Koschmieder's law exclusively using the
image data. The proposed method estimates the visibility by integrating the
physical model into the proposed framework, instead of directly predicting the
visibility value via the convolutional neural work. Moreover, we estimate the
visibility as a pixel-wise visibility map against those of previous visibility
measurement methods which solely predict a single value for an entire image.
Thus, the estimated result of our method is more informative, particularly in
uneven fog scenarios, which can benefit to developing a more precise early
warning system for foggy weather, thereby better protecting the intelligent
transportation infrastructure systems and promoting its development. To
validate the proposed framework, a virtual dataset, FACI, containing 3,000
foggy images in different concentrations, is collected using the AirSim

long-range sensing under diverse weather conditions. But radar is also a
particularly challenging sensing modality due to the radar noises. Recent works
have made enormous progress in classifying free and occupied spaces in radar
images by leveraging lidar label supervision. However, there are still several
unsolved issues. Firstly, the sensing distance of the results is limited by the
sensing range of lidar. Secondly, the performance of the results is degenerated
by lidar due to the physical sensing discrepancies between the two sensors. For
example, some objects visible to lidar are invisible to radar, and some objects
occluded in lidar scans are visible in radar images because of the radar's
penetrating capability. These sensing differences cause false positive and
penetrating capability degeneration, respectively.
  In this paper, we propose training data preprocessing and polar sliding
window inference to solve the issues. The data preprocessing aims to reduce the
effect caused by radar-invisible measurements in lidar scans. The polar sliding
window inference aims to solve the limited sensing range issue by applying a
near-range trained network to the long-range region. Instead of using common
Cartesian representation, we propose to use polar representation to reduce the
shape dissimilarity between long-range and near-range data. We find that
extending a near-range trained network to long-range region inference in the
polar space has 4.2 times better IoU than in Cartesian space. Besides, the
polar sliding window inference can preserve the radar penetrating capability by

(I2I) translation task which aims to transfer adverse condition domain (eg,
rainy night) to standard domain (eg, day). It is a challenging task because
images from adverse domains have some artifacts and insufficient information.
Recently, many studies employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have
achieved notable success in I2I translation but there are still limitations in
applying them to adverse weather enhancement. Symmetric architecture based on
bidirectional cycle-consistency loss is adopted as a standard framework for
unsupervised domain transfer methods. However, it can lead to inferior
translation result if the two domains have imbalanced information. To address
this issue, we propose a novel GAN model, i.e., AU-GAN, which has an asymmetric
architecture for adverse domain translation. We insert a proposed feature
transfer network (${T}$-net) in only a normal domain generator (i.e., rainy
night-> day) to enhance encoded features of the adverse domain image. In
addition, we introduce asymmetric feature matching for disentanglement of
encoded features. Finally, we propose uncertainty-aware cycle-consistency loss
to address the regional uncertainty of a cyclic reconstructed image. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by qualitative and quantitative
comparisons with state-of-the-art models. Codes are available at

dislocations which easily glide in the prismatic planes where they are
dissociated. At high enough temperatures, these dislocations can deviate out of
the prism planes to also glide in the first order pyramidal and basal planes.
To get a better understanding of these secondary slip systems, we have
performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a screw dislocation gliding in
a basal plane. The gliding dislocation remains dissociated in the prism plane
where it performs a random motion and occasionally cross-slips out of its habit
plane by the nucleation and propagation of a kink-pair. Deviation planes are
always pyramidal, with an equal probability to cross-slip in the two pyramidal
planes on both sides of the basal plane, thus leading to basal slip on average.
Basal slip appears therefore as a combination of prismatic and pyramidal slip
in the high stress regime explored in MD simulations. This is confirmed by
nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations. But NEB calculations also reveal a
change of glide mechanism for a decreasing applied stress. At low stress, kinks
do not lie anymore in the pyramidal planes. They are now spread in the basal
planes, thus fully compatible with a motion of the screw dislocation confined
to the basal plane as seen in experiments. Basal slip, which is in competition
with pyramidal slip, appears therefore favoured at low stress in pure
zirconium.

been widely applied in training large-scale models. Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) is arguably the workhorse algorithm of ML. Distributed ML models trained
by SGD involve large amounts of gradient communication, which limits the
scalability of distributed ML. Thus, it is important to compress the gradients
for reducing communication. In this paper, we propose FastSGD, a Fast
compressed SGD framework for distributed ML. To achieve a high compression
ratio at a low cost, FastSGD represents the gradients as key-value pairs, and
compresses both the gradient keys and values in linear time complexity. For the
gradient value compression, FastSGD first uses a reciprocal mapper to transform
original values into reciprocal values, and then, it utilizes a logarithm
quantization to further reduce reciprocal values to small integers. Finally,
FastSGD filters reduced gradient integers by a given threshold. For the
gradient key compression, FastSGD provides an adaptive fine-grained delta
encoding method to store gradient keys with fewer bits. Extensive experiments
on practical ML models and datasets demonstrate that FastSGD achieves the
compression ratio up to 4 orders of magnitude, and accelerates the convergence
time up to 8x, compared with state-of-the-art methods.

aspects of particle physics but fails at calculating particle masses.
Therefore, for this paper a Kaluza-Klein like model was developed based on the
structure of the Standard Model. The model consists of 10 dimensions which are:
one time, three usual macroscopic space and six compactified dimensions.
Excitations - disturbances traveling with the speed of light on the 10D
spacetime - are introduced. An excitation on a compactified dimension can
induce a mass in 4D spacetime; it is accompanied by an integer, the excitation
number, and has a well-defined spin. The model's free parameters are computed
using the measured masses of the charged leptons, including the upper bound of
the mass difference between electron and positron, the mesons $\pi^{0},
\pi^{+}, \rho^{0}, \phi, \psi, \Upsilon$, the top-quark mass, and the anomalous
magnetic moment of the electron. The most important of the derived parameters
are the compactification radius $\rho$, the weak coupling $\alpha_{w}$, the
strong coupling $\alpha_{s}$ and the anti-neutrino to neutrino density ratio
$\delta$. The formulas for calculating hadron masses are given and applied to
approximately one hundred composite particles, which are compiled within four
separate tables. The comparison between the measured masses of 64 hadrons and
the calculations shows relative errors below $0.05$ for 50\% and below $0.1$ in
85\% of all cases. Pearson's correlation coefficient of masses measured versus

inflexible models whose structures are fixed under different scenes, this

branches that are better at different scenes. An improvement over single-level
graph representations is achieved in this way. An understanding of scenes is
achieved and serves anomaly detection. High-level graph representations are
assigned higher weights to encode moving speed and directions of people in
low-resolution videos while low-level graph representations are assigned higher
weights to encode human skeletons in high-resolution videos. Experimental
results show that the proposed HSTGCNN significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art models on four benchmark datasets (UCSD Pedestrian,

and a ``non-decoupled'' set that was already identified in the neutral
holographic plasma in \cite{Betzios:2018kwn}. In the extremal limit, the former
set of imaginary quasi-normal modes coalesce on a branch cut starting from the

layers to construct the [(MBT)(MnTe)m]N superlattices by molecular beam

exchange spring effect at the MBT/MnTe hetero-interfaces. Moreover, the precise

among the constituent magnetic orders, leading to tunable magnetoelectric
responses, while the superlattice periodicity serves as an additional tuning
parameter to tailor the spin configurations of the synthesized multi-layers.

gravity can lead to additional gravity-Higgs portals for gravitational dark
matter to decay and contribute additional decay (AD) width. For scalar dark
matter candidates with a mass less than 5 TeV, the decay branching ratios are
almost independent of whether dark matter decay through gravity portals or
gravity-Higgs portals; therefore, it is almost impossible to distinguish
gravity portals from gravity-Higgs portals by observing decay products. For
fermionic singlet dark matter candidates, their MD products are diverse, while
their AD products are monotonous, only neutrinos and Higgs bosons. As for both
dark matter candidates, gravity-Higgs portals prefer to dominate the decay at
around several hundred GeV. Besides, for both TeV dark matter candidates, there
is still a vast parameter space alive.

low-rank modal structures and dynamics from high-dimensional measurements.
However, DMD frequently produces models that are sensitive to noise, fail to
generalize outside the training data, and violate basic physical laws. Our
physics-informed DMD (piDMD) optimization, which may be formulated as a
Procrustes problem, restricts the family of admissible models to a matrix
manifold that respects the physical structure of the system. We focus on five
fundamental physical principles -- conservation, self-adjointness,
localization, causality, and shift-invariance -- and derive several closed-form
solutions and efficient algorithms for the corresponding piDMD optimizations.
With fewer degrees of freedom, piDMD models are less prone to overfitting,
require less training data, and are often less computationally expensive to
build than standard DMD models. We demonstrate piDMD on a range of challenging
problems in the physical sciences, including energy-preserving fluid flow,
travelling-wave systems, the Schr\""odinger equation, solute
advection-diffusion, a system with causal dynamics, and three-dimensional
transitional channel flow. In each case, piDMD significantly outperforms
standard DMD in metrics such as spectral identification, state prediction, and
estimation of optimal forcings and responses.

the literature. In this respect, the Gordon-Loeb model and its extensions
received wide-scale acceptance. However, such models predominantly rely on
restrictive assumptions that are not adapted for analyzing dynamic aspects of

feature for studying cyber-security investment in the context of a fast-paced

the Gordon-Loeb model by considering multi-period and relaxing the assumption
of a continuous security-breach probability function. Such theoretical
adaptations enable to capture dynamic aspects of cyber-security investment such
as the advent of a disruptive technology and its investment consequences. Such
a proposed extension of the Gordon-Loeb model gives room for a hypothetical
decrease of the optimal level of cyber-security investment, due to a potential
technological shift. While we believe our framework should be generalizable
across the cyber-security milieu, we illustrate our approach in the context of
critical-infrastructure protection, where security-cost reductions related to
risk events are of paramount importance as potential losses reach unaffordable
proportions. Moreover, despite the fact that some technologies are considered
as disruptive and thus promising for critical-infrastructure protection, their

synthesize rather realistic details for human body, they tend to produce poor
results when the input has self-occlusion, especially for unseen humans under
sparse views. Moreover, these methods often require a large number of sampling
points for rendering, which leads to low efficiency and limits their real-world
applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometry-guided
Progressive NeRF (GP-NeRF). In particular, to better tackle self-occlusion, we
devise a geometry-guided multi-view feature integration approach that utilizes
the estimated geometry prior to integrate the incomplete information from input
views and construct a complete geometry volume for the target human body.
Meanwhile, for achieving higher rendering efficiency, we introduce a
progressive rendering pipeline through geometry guidance, which leverages the
geometric feature volume and the predicted density values to progressively
reduce the number of sampling points and speed up the rendering process.
Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and THUman datasets show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-arts significantly across multiple generalization
settings, while the time cost is reduced > 70% via applying our efficient
progressive rendering pipeline.

inside which the local kinematics are dominated by peculiar-velocity

than the aforementioned critical length, which typically varies between few

surrounding universe is still decelerating globally. Overall, distant observers
can assign very different values to their local deceleration parameters,
entirely because of their relative motion. In practice, this suggests that
information selected from regions inside and close to the transition scale hold
only locally and they should not be readily extrapolated to the global
universe. We show that this principle applies to essentially all Friedmann
backgrounds, irrespective of their equation of state and spatial curvature. Put
another way, the transition scale and the related effects are generic to linear

technology was used to find plausible hypotheses that have led to two original
mathematical results: one in knot theory, one in representation theory. I argue
here that the significance and novelty of this application of DL technology to
mathematics is significantly overstated in the paper under review and has been
wildly overstated in some of the accounts in the popular science press. In the
knot theory result, the role of DL was small, and a conventional statistical
analysis would probably have sufficed. In the representation theory result, the
role of DL is much larger; however, it is not very different in kind from what
has been done in experimental mathematics for decades. Moreover, it is not
clear whether the distinctive features of DL that make it useful here will
apply across a wide range of mathematical problems. Finally, I argue that the
DL here ""guides human intuition"" is unhelpful and misleading; what the DL does
primarily does is to mark many possible conjectures as false and a few others
as possibly worthy of study.
  Certainly the representation theory result represents an original and
interesting application of DL to mathematical research, but its larger
significance is uncertain.

that no differences between probability-matching and maximization strategies

formation of rod-like grains occurs for x=0.5 due to the stress-induced
transformation of the thin film perovskite structure. Moreover, it was revealed
that during Nb cationic substitution Aurivillius phase formation was enhanced
and become dominated in SBTN thin films and fluorite/pyrochlore phase formation
was highly suppressed. We assume that these changes are conditioned by the
ferrodistortion occurring in ferroic perovskites, namely by the tilting
distortion of (Ta,Nb)O6 octahedra for x=0.2-0.5. The octahedral tilting
distortion can change the coordination environment of the A-cite cation, as
well as it lowers the SBTN symmetry due to the differences in ionic radius and
mass between Ta and Nb in the B-sites, that can lead to significant changes of
the SBTN crystal structure. The same nonmonotonic trends were observed for the
ferroelectric perovskite phase fraction and remanent polarization on Nb content
in SBTN films. The substituting Nb atoms with a concentration of 10-20 % made
it possible to increase the remanent polarization in 3 times and raise the
perovskite phase fraction from 66% to 87%. Therefore, obtained results can be
used for the production of lead-free thin films with a high remanent

explain molecular line observations in the cold gas of star-forming regions.
Chemical desorption is one of the nonthermal desorption processes and is driven
by the energy released by chemical reactions. After an exothermic surface
reaction, the excess energy is transferred to products' translational energy in
the direction perpendicular to the surface, leading to desorption. The
desorption probability of product species, especially that of product species
from water ice surfaces, is not well understood. This uncertainty limits our
understanding of the interplay between gas-phase and ice surface chemistry. In
the present work, we constrain the desorption probability of H$_2$S and PH$_3$
per reaction event on porous amorphous solid water (ASW) by numerically
simulating previous laboratory experiments. Adopting the microscopic kinetic
Monte Carlo method, we find that the desorption probabilities of H$_2$S and
PH$_3$ from porous ASW per hydrogen addition event of the precursor species are
$3 \pm 1.5$ % and $4 \pm 2$ %, respectively. These probabilities are consistent
with a theoretical model of chemical desorption proposed in the literature if
$\sim$7 % of energy released by the reactions is transferred to the
translational excitation of the products. As a byproduct, we find that
approximately 70 % (40 %) of adsorption sites for atomic H on porous ASW should
have a binding energy lower than $\sim$300 K ($\sim$200 K). The astrochemical
implications of our findings are briefly discussed.

stationary, time-periodic breather modes appear as the discrete breather
lattice solutions whose period mismatches with a system size. Thanks to
easy-plane single-ion anisotropy intrinsic to CrNb$_3$S$_6$, these modes are of
the dark type with frequencies lying within the linear spin-wave band, close to
its bottom edge. They represent cnoidal states of magnetization, similar to the
well-known soliton lattice ground state, with differing but limited number of

verified by means of the Floquet analysis. Their energy controlled by two

valid approach to extract information in several data analysis applications.
This is especially true when multimodal datasets are investigated, as records
collected by means of diverse sensing strategies are taken into account and
explored. Nevertheless, classic graph signal processing is based on a model for
information propagation that is configured according to heat diffusion
mechanism. This system provides several constraints and assumptions on the data
properties that might be not valid for multimodal data analysis, especially
when large scale datasets collected from heterogeneous sources are considered,
so that the accuracy and robustness of the outcomes might be severely
jeopardized. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for graph definition

graph-based data analysis to take into account several issues of modern data
analysis in operational scenarios, so to provide a platform for precise,

diffusion model to drive a community detection scheme, i.e., to divide
multimodal datasets into many groups according to similarity among nodes in an
unsupervised fashion. Experimental results achieved by testing real multimodal
datasets in diverse application scenarios show that our method is able to
strongly outperform state-of-the-art schemes for community detection in

applications, including single-image super-resolution (SISR). With residual
connection architecture, deeply stacked convolutional neural networks provide a
substantial performance boost for SISR, but their huge parameters and
computational loads are impractical for real-world applications. Thus,
designing lightweight models with acceptable performance is one of the major
tasks in current SISR research. The objective of lightweight network design is
to balance a computational load and reconstruction performance. Most of the
previous methods have manually designed complex and predefined fixed
structures, which generally required a large number of experiments and lacked
flexibility in the diversity of input image statistics. In this paper, we
propose a dynamic residual self-attention network (DRSAN) for lightweight SISR,
while focusing on the automated design of residual connections between building
blocks. The proposed DRSAN has dynamic residual connections based on dynamic
residual attention (DRA), which adaptively changes its structure according to
input statistics. Specifically, we propose a dynamic residual module that
explicitly models the DRA by finding the interrelation between residual paths
and input image statistics, as well as assigning proper weights to each
residual path. We also propose a residual self-attention (RSA) module to
further boost the performance, which produces 3-dimensional attention maps
without additional parameters by cooperating with residual structures. The
proposed dynamic scheme, exploiting the combination of DRA and RSA, shows an
efficient trade-off between computational complexity and network performance.
Experimental results show that the DRSAN performs better than or comparable to
existing state-of-the-art lightweight models for SISR.

  challenge, dataset and evaluation in the era of deep learning",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Image registration is a fundamental medical image analysis task, and a wide
variety of approaches have been proposed. However, only a few studies have
comprehensively compared medical image registration approaches on a wide range
of clinically relevant tasks. This limits the development of registration
methods, the adoption of research advances into practice, and a fair benchmark
across competing approaches. The Learn2Reg challenge addresses these
limitations by providing a multi-task medical image registration data set for
comprehensive characterisation of deformable registration algorithms. A
continuous evaluation will be possible at
https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org. Learn2Reg covers a wide range of
anatomies (brain, abdomen, and thorax), modalities (ultrasound, CT, MR),
availability of annotations, as well as intra- and inter-patient registration
evaluation. We established an easily accessible framework for training and
validation of 3D registration methods, which enabled the compilation of results
of over 65 individual method submissions from more than 20 unique teams. We
used a complementary set of metrics, including robustness, accuracy,
plausibility, and runtime, enabling unique insight into the current
state-of-the-art of medical image registration. This paper describes datasets,
tasks, evaluation methods and results of the challenge, as well as results of
further analysis of transferability to new datasets, the importance of label
supervision, and resulting bias. While no single approach worked best across
all tasks, many methodological aspects could be identified that push the
performance of medical image registration to new state-of-the-art performance.
Furthermore, we demystified the common belief that conventional registration
methods have to be much slower than deep-learning-based methods.

top-performance image restorers. They aggregate global information from input
features along entire spatial dimensions but behave differently during training
and inference in image restoration tasks: they are based on different regions,
namely the cropped patches (from images) and the full-resolution images. This
paper revisits global information aggregation and finds that the image-based
features during inference have a different distribution than the patch-based
features during training. This train-test inconsistency negatively impacts the
performance of models, which is severely overlooked by previous works. To
reduce the inconsistency and improve test-time performance, we propose a simple
method called Test-time Local Converter (TLC). Our TLC converts global
operations to local ones only during inference so that they aggregate features
within local spatial regions rather than the entire large images. The proposed
method can be applied to various global modules (e.g., normalization, channel
and spatial attention) with negligible costs. Without the need for any
fine-tuning, TLC improves state-of-the-art results on several image restoration
tasks, including single-image motion deblurring, video deblurring, defocus
deblurring, and image denoising. In particular, with TLC, our Restormer-Local

error accumulation. In this study, we proposed an unsupervised Binary Change
Guided hyperspectral multiclass change detection Network (BCG-Net) for HMCD,
which aims at boosting the multiclass change detection result and unmixing
result with the mature binary change detection approaches. In BCG-Net, a novel
partial-siamese united-unmixing module is designed for multi-temporal spectral
unmixing, and a groundbreaking temporal correlation constraint directed by the
pseudo-labels of binary change detection result is developed to guide the
unmixing process from the perspective of change detection, encouraging the
abundance of the unchanged pixels more coherent and that of the changed pixels
more accurate. Moreover, an innovative binary change detection rule is put
forward to deal with the problem that traditional rule is susceptible to
numerical values. The iterative optimization of the spectral unmixing process

shape of structures of interest, their relative pose, and image intensity
profiles representative of some physical property. Often, these are modelled
separately through statistical models by decomposing the object's features into
a set of basis functions through principal geodesic analysis or principal
component analysis. This study presents a statistical modelling method for
automatic learning of shape, pose and intensity features in medical images
which we call the Dynamic multi feature-class Gaussian process models
(DMFC-GPM). A DMFC-GPM is a Gaussian process (GP)-based model with a shared
latent space that encodes linear and non-linear variation. Our method is
defined in a continuous domain with a principled way to represent shape, pose
and intensity feature classes in a linear space, based on deformation fields. A
deformation field-based metric is adapted in the method for modelling shape and
intensity feature variation as well as for comparing rigid transformations
(pose). Moreover, DMFC-GPMs inherit properties intrinsic to GPs including
marginalisation and regression. Furthermore, they allow for adding additional
pose feature variability on top of those obtained from the image acquisition
process; what we term as permutation modelling. For image analysis tasks using
DMFC-GPMs, we adapt Metropolis-Hastings algorithms making the prediction of
features fully probabilistic. We validate the method using controlled synthetic
data and we perform experiments on bone structures from CT images of the
shoulder to illustrate the efficacy of the model for pose and shape feature
prediction. The model performance results suggest that this new modelling
paradigm is robust, accurate, accessible, and has potential applications
including the management of musculoskeletal disorders and clinical decision
making

to find $U(1)$ local cosmic string solutions in the context of the hybrid

finding the dynamical equations for this particular case, we imposed boost
invariance along $t$ and $z$ directions, which simplified the equations of
motions, leaving only one single metric tensor component, $W^2(r)$. For an
arbitrary potential $V(\phi)$, the solutions obtained can be put in a closed
parametric form, with $\phi$ taken as a parameter. Several particular cases of
the potential were studied, some yielding simple mathematical forms, others
with only numerical solutions. With this approach, we obtain a large number of
new stable stringlike solutions in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, in which the
parameters, like the scalar field, metric tensor components, and string
tension, depend fundamentally on the boundary values of the scalar field, and
its derivative, on the $r(0)$ circular axis.

analysis. While there is a growing body of literature on fairness in analysis
of fully observed data, there has been little theoretical work on investigating
fairness in analysis of incomplete data. In practice, a popular analytical
approach for dealing with missing data is to use only the set of complete
cases, i.e., observations with all features fully observed to train a
prediction algorithm. However, depending on the missing data mechanism, the
distribution of complete cases and the distribution of the complete data may be
substantially different. When the goal is to develop a fair algorithm in the
complete data domain where there are no missing values, an algorithm that is
fair in the complete case domain may show disproportionate bias towards some
marginalized groups in the complete data domain. To fill this significant gap,
we study the problem of estimating fairness in the complete data domain for an
arbitrary model evaluated merely using complete cases. We provide upper and
lower bounds on the fairness estimation error and conduct numerical experiments
to assess our theoretical results. Our work provides the first known
theoretical results on fairness guarantee in analysis of incomplete data.

production of complex organic particles, forming Titan's thick haze layers.
Laboratory-produced aerosol analogs, or ""tholins"", are produced in a number of
laboratories; however, most previous studies have investigated analogs produced
by only one laboratory rather than a systematic, comparative analysis. In this
study, we performed a comparative study of an important material property, the
surface energy, of seven tholin samples produced in three independent
laboratories under a broad range of experimental conditions, and explored their
commonalities and differences. All seven tholin samples are found to have high
surface energies, and are therefore highly cohesive. Thus, if the surface
sediments on Titan are similar to tholins, future missions such as Dragonfly
will likely encounter sticky sediments. We also identified a commonality
between all the tholin samples: a high dispersive (non-polar) surface energy
component of at least 30 mJ/m2. This common property could be shared by the
actual haze particles on Titan as well. Given that the most abundant species
interacting with the haze on Titan (methane, ethane, and nitrogen) are
non-polar in nature, the dispersive surface energy component of the haze
particles could be a determinant factor in condensate-haze and haze-lake
liquids interactions on Titan. With this common trait of tholin samples, we
confirmed the findings of a previous study by Yu et al. (2020) that haze
particles are likely good cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) for methane and
ethane clouds and would likely be completely wetted by the hydrocarbon lakes on
Titan.

blindly graded the HER2 scores of virtually stained and immunohistochemically
stained HER2 whole slide images (WSIs) to reveal that the HER2 scores
determined by inspecting virtual IHC images are as accurate as their
immunohistochemically stained counterparts. A second quantitative blinded study
performed by the same diagnosticians further revealed that the virtually

problem, and many distributed optimization algorithms have been developed over

each participating device remains local. This addresses, to some extend, the
privacy concern. They also provide computational scalability as they allow
exploiting computational resources distributed across many edge devices.
However, in practice, this does not directly lead to a linear gain in the
overall learning speed with the number of devices. This is partly due to the
communication bottleneck limiting the overall computation speed. Additionally,
wireless devices are highly heterogeneous in their computational capabilities,
and both their computation speed and communication rate can be highly
time-varying due to physical factors. Therefore, distributed learning
algorithms, particularly those to be implemented at the wireless network edge,
must be carefully designed taking into account the impact of time-varying

address the challenge of real-time quantitative multiphase flow imaging based
on non-invasive and non-radioactive technologies. Multiphase flow is ubiquitous
in nature, industry, and research. Accurate flow imaging is the key to
understanding this complex phenomenon. Existing non-radioactive multiphase flow
imaging methods based on electrical tomography are limited to providing
qualitative images. The proposed DT framework, building upon a synergistic
integration of 3D field coupling simulation, model-based deep learning, and
edge computing, allows ET to dynamically learn the flow features in the virtual
space and implement the model in the physical system, thus providing
unprecedented resolution and accuracy. The DT framework is demonstrated on
gas-liquid two-phase flow and electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). It can
be readily extended to various tomography modalities, scenarios, and scales in
biomedical, energy, and aerospace applications as an effective alternative to

certain regions, is a fundamental task in smart cities. One of the key
properties of crowd flow data is periodicity: a pattern that occurs at regular
time intervals, such as a weekly pattern. To capture such periodicity, existing
studies either fuse the periodic hidden states into channels for networks to
learn or apply extra periodic strategies to the network architecture. In this
paper, we devise a novel periodic residual learning network (PRNet) for a
better modeling of periodicity in crowd flow data. Unlike existing methods,
PRNet frames the crowd flow forecasting as a periodic residual learning problem
by modeling the variation between the inputs (the previous time period) and the
outputs (the future time period). Compared to directly predicting crowd flows
that are highly dynamic, learning more stationary deviation is much easier,
which thus facilitates the model training. Besides, the learned variation
enables the network to produce the residual between future conditions and its
corresponding weekly observations at each time interval, and therefore
contributes to substantially more accurate multi-step ahead predictions.
Extensive experiments show that PRNet can be easily integrated into existing
models to enhance their predictive performance.

data from the wearables worn by individuals. Many existing studies rely on such
sensory data for human activity recognition (HAR); however, one of the major
bottlenecks is their reliance on pre-annotated or labeled data. Manual
human-driven annotations are neither scalable nor efficient, whereas existing
auto-annotation techniques heavily depend on video signatures. Still,
video-based auto-annotation needs high computation resources and has privacy
concerns when the data from a personal space, like a smart-home, is transferred
to the cloud. This paper exploits the acoustic signatures generated from human
activities to label the wearables' IMU data at the edge, thus mitigating
resource requirement and data privacy concerns. We utilize acoustic-based
pre-trained HAR models for cross-modal labeling of the IMU data even when two
individuals perform simultaneous but different activities under the same
environmental context. We observe that non-overlapping acoustic gaps exist with
a high probability during the simultaneous activities performed by two
individuals in the environment's acoustic context, which helps us resolve the
overlapping activity signatures to label them individually. A principled
evaluation of the proposed approach on two real-life in-house datasets further
augmented to create a dual occupant setup, shows that the framework can
correctly annotate a significant volume of unlabeled IMU data from both
individuals with an accuracy of $\mathbf{82.59\%}$ ($\mathbf{\pm 17.94\%}$) and
$\mathbf{98.32\%}$ ($\mathbf{\pm 3.68\%}$), respectively, for a workshop and a

works have shown that these patterns can be extracted efficiently in an
unsupervised way, e.g., using Convolutional Dictionary Learning. This leads to
an event-based description of the data. Given these events, a natural question
is to estimate how their occurrences are modulated by certain cognitive tasks
and experimental manipulations. To address it, we propose a point process
approach. While point processes have been used in neuroscience in the past, in
particular for single cell recordings (spike trains), techniques such as
Convolutional Dictionary Learning make them amenable to human studies based on
EEG/MEG signals. We develop a novel statistical point process model-called
driven temporal point processes (DriPP)-where the intensity function of the
point process model is linked to a set of point processes corresponding to
stimulation events. We derive a fast and principled expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of this model. Simulations reveal
that model parameters can be identified from long enough signals. Results on
standard MEG datasets demonstrate that our methodology reveals event-related
neural responses-both evoked and induced-and isolates non-task specific
temporal patterns.

moderate success when applied to data acquired in static, well-controlled lab
environments. However, an open-world environment is a more realistic setting,
where situations affecting EEG recordings can emerge unexpectedly,
significantly weakening the robustness of existing methods. In recent years,
deep learning (DL) has emerged as a potential solution for such problems due to
its superior capacity in feature extraction. It overcomes the limitations of
defining `handcrafted' features or features extracted using shallow
architectures, but typically requires large amounts of costly,
expertly-labelled data - something not always obtainable. Combining DL with
domain-specific knowledge may allow for development of robust approaches to
decode brain activity even with small-sample data. Although various DL methods
have been proposed to tackle some of the challenges in EEG decoding, a
systematic tutorial overview, particularly for open-world applications, is
currently lacking. This article therefore provides a comprehensive survey of DL

models that can capture users' evolving interest over time to successfully
recommend future items that they are likely to interact with. For users with
long histories, typical models based on recurrent neural networks tend to
forget important items in the distant past. Recent works have shown that
storing a small sketch of past items can improve sequential recommendation
tasks. However, these works all rely on static sketching policies, i.e.,
heuristics to select items to keep in the sketch, which are not necessarily
optimal and cannot improve over time with more training data. In this paper, we
propose a differentiable policy for sketching (DiPS), a framework that learns a
data-driven sketching policy in an end-to-end manner together with the
recommender system model to explicitly maximize recommendation quality in the
future. We also propose an approximate estimator of the gradient for optimizing
the sketching algorithm parameters that is computationally efficient. We verify
the effectiveness of DiPS on real-world datasets under various practical
settings and show that it requires up to $50\%$ fewer sketch items to reach the
same predictive quality than existing sketching policies.

study, an item-level relevance cross-domain recommendation task is explored,
where two related domains, that is, the source and the target domain contain
common items without sharing sensitive information regarding the users'
behavior, and thus avoiding the leak of user privacy. In light of this
scenario, two novel coupled autoencoder-based deep learning methods are
proposed for cross-domain recommendation. The first method aims to
simultaneously learn a pair of autoencoders in order to reveal the intrinsic

coupled mapping function to model the non-linear relationships between these
representations, thus transferring beneficial information from the source to
the target domain. The second method is derived based on a new joint
regularized optimization problem, which employs two autoencoders to generate in
a deep and non-linear manner the user and item-latent factors, while at the
same time a data-driven function is learnt to map the item-latent factors

recognizing structures and relating these to each other. For example, any
meteorological description of a weather condition and explanation of its
evolution recurs to meteorological structures, such as convection and
circulation structures, cloud fields and rain fronts. All of these are
spatiotemporal structures, defined by time-dependent patterns in the underlying
fields. Typically, such a structure is defined by a verbal description that
corresponds to the more or less uniform, often somewhat vague mental images of
the experts.
  However, a precise, formal definition of the structures or, more generally,
concepts is often desirable, e.g., to enable automated data analysis or the
development of phenomenological models. Here, we present a systematic approach
and an interactive tool to obtain formal definitions of spatiotemporal
structures. The tool enables experts to evaluate and compare different
structure definitions on the basis of data sets with time-dependent fields that
contain the respective structure. Since structure definitions are typically
parameterized, an essential part is to identify parameter ranges that lead to
desired structures in all time steps. In addition, it is important to allow a
quantitative assessment of the resulting structures simultaneously. We
demonstrate the use of the tool by applying it to two meteorological examples:
finding structure definitions for vortex cores and center lines of temporarily
evolving tropical cyclones.
  Ideally, structure definitions should be objective and applicable to as many
data sets as possible. However, finding such definitions, e.g., for the common
atmospheric structures in meteorology, can only be a long-term goal. The
proposed procedure, together with the presented tool, is just a first approach
to facilitate this long and arduous way.
