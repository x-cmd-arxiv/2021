vital factor for the safety of intelligent transportation. However, most of the
critical scenes of traffic accidents are extremely dynamic and previously
unseen, which seriously harm the performance of semantic segmentation methods.
In addition, the delay of the traditional camera during high-speed driving will
further reduce the contextual information in the time dimension. Therefore, we
propose to extract dynamic context from event-based data with a higher temporal
resolution to enhance static RGB images, even for those from traffic accidents
with motion blur, collisions, deformations, overturns, etc. Moreover, in order
to evaluate the segmentation performance in traffic accidents, we provide a
pixel-wise annotated accident dataset, namely DADA-seg, which contains a
variety of critical scenarios from traffic accidents. Our experiments indicate
that event-based data can provide complementary information to stabilize
semantic segmentation under adverse conditions by preserving fine-grained
motion of fast-moving foreground (crash objects) in accidents. Our approach
achieves +8.2% performance gain on the proposed accident dataset, exceeding
more than 20 state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods. The proposal has
been demonstrated to be consistently effective for models learned on multiple
source databases including Cityscapes, KITTI-360, BDD, and ApolloScape.

know the map of the environment and the location of the access points. Thus,
several works have resorted to automated learning in order to infer a device's
location from the properties of the received mmWave signals. However,
collecting training data for such models is a significant burden. In this work,
we propose a shallow neural network model to localize mmWave devices indoors.
This model requires significantly fewer weights than those proposed in the
literature. Therefore, it is amenable for implementation in
resource-constrained hardware, and needs fewer training samples to converge. We
also propose to relieve training data collection efforts by retrieving
(inherently imperfect) location estimates from geometry-based mmWave
localization algorithms. Even in this case, our results show that the proposed
neural networks perform as good as or better than state-of-the-art algorithms.

  Models",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study a class of robust assortment optimization problems that was proposed
by Farias, Jagabathula, and Shah (2013). The goal in this class of problems is
to find an assortment that maximizes a firm's worst-case expected revenue under
all ranking-based choice models that are consistent with the historical sales
data generated by the firm's past assortments. Despite its significance in the
revenue management literature, this class of robust optimization problems is
widely believed to be computationally intractable, and no practical algorithms
for solving these problems have been developed thus far.
  Our main contributions in this paper are three-fold. First, we establish that
optimal assortments for these robust optimization problems have a simple
structure that is closely related to the structure of revenue-ordered
assortments. Second, we demonstrate that the class of robust optimization
problems can be solved in reasonable computation times in various settings of
practical importance. Specifically, we develop exact algorithms for solving the
robust optimization problems that run in polynomial time for any fixed number
of past assortments. Moreover, when the firm's past assortments satisfy a
common assumption, we show that the robust optimization problem can be
reformulated as a compact mixed-integer linear optimization problem of size
that is polynomial in the number of products as well as the number of past
assortments. Third, we use our algorithms and structural results to derive a
number of managerial insights regarding the value of robust optimization and
the risks of estimate-then-optimize in the context of data-driven assortment
optimization with ranking-based choice models.

great promise for an extended control of electronic and valleytronic lifetimes,
the confinement of excitons in artificial moir\'e lattices, and the formation
of novel exotic quantum phases. Such moir\'e-induced emergent phenomena are
particularly strong for interlayer excitons, where the hole and the electron
are localized in different layers of the heterostructure. In order to exploit
the full potential of correlated moir\'e and exciton physics, a thorough
understanding of the ultrafast interlayer exciton formation process and the
real-space wavefunction confinement in the moir\'e potential is indispensable.
However, direct experimental access to these parameters is limited since most
excitonic quasiparticles are optically dark. Here we show that femtosecond
photoemission momentum microscopy provides quantitative access to these key
properties of the moir\'e interlayer excitons. We find that interlayer excitons
are dominantly formed on the sub-50~fs timescale via interlayer tunneling at
the K valleys of the Brillouin zones. In addition, we directly measure
energy-momentum fingerprints of the moir\'e interlayer excitons by mapping
their spectral signatures within the mini Brillouin zone that is built up by
the twisted heterostructure. From these momentum-fingerprints, we gain
quantitative access to the modulation of the exciton wavefunction within the
moir\'e potential in real-space. Our work provides the first direct access to
the interlayer moir\'e exciton formation dynamics in space and time and reveals
new opportunities to study correlated moir\'e and exciton physics for the
future realization of exotic quantum phases of matter.

presence of a companion star. We focus on systems of three planets orbiting the
primary star and estimate the timescale for instability finding that it scales
with the keplerian period for systems that have the same ratio between inner
planet and binary semimajor axes. An empirical formula is also derived from
simulations to estimate how the the binary eccentricity affects the extent of
the stability region. The presence of the secondary star affects the Planet
Planet scattering outcomes causing a broadening of the final distribution in
semimajor axis of the inner planet as some of the orbital energy of the planets
is absorbed by the companion star. Repeated approaches to the secondary star
causes also a significant reduction in the frequency of surviving two planet
systems in particular for larger values of the inner planet semimajor axis. The
formation of Kozai states with the companion star increases the number of
planets which may be tidally circularized. To predict the possible final
distribution of planets in binaries we have performed a large number of
simulations where the initial semimajor axis of the inner planets is chosen
randomly. For small values of the binary semimajor axis, the higher frequency
of collision alter the final planet orbital distributions which, however,
beyond 50 au appear to be scalable to wider binary separations.

scattering, we study the deflection of light by a heavy massive
spinless/spinning object. WQFT requires the use of the worldline dressed
propagator of a photon in a gravitational background, which we construct from
first principles. The action required to set up the worldline path integral is
constructed using auxiliary variables, which describe dynamically the spin
degrees of freedom of the photon and take care of path ordering. We test the
fully regulated path integral by recovering the photon--photon-graviton vertex.
With the dressed propagator at hand, we follow the WQFT procedure by setting up
the partition function and deriving the Feynman rules which can be used to
evaluate it perturbatively. These rules depend on the auxiliary variables. The
latter ultimately do not contribute in the geometric-optics regime, which
realizes the equivalence between the scattering of a photon and a massive
scalar with that of a massless and a massive scalar. Then, the calculation of
the eikonal phase and the deflection angle simplifies considerably. Using the
eikonal phase defined in terms of the partition function, we calculate
explicitly the deflection angle at NLO in the spinless case, and at LO in the
spinning case up to quadratic order in spin.

collective phenomenon occurring in active matter without alignment interactions
(scalar active matter). Its basic origin is simple: since self-propelled
particles accumulate where they move slowly, having a propulsion speed that
decreases steeply enough with density, due to collisions or chemical
interactions, leads to a feedback loop that induces the formation of a dense
phase. In these notes, I will discuss some of the main theoretical and
computational efforts that have been made over the last decade in understanding
the basic structural and dynamical properties of MIPS phase coexistence in
microscopic active particle models.

possible chemical alteration of poly-lactic acid (PLA) matrix in respect to the
optimization of cellular and antibacterial behavior were investigated in this
study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) morphological examination of the
processed PLA surface showed the formation of diverse hierarchical surface
microstructures, generated by irradiation with a range of laser fluences (F)
and scanning velocities (V) values. By controlling the laser parameters,
diverse surface roughness can be achieved, thus influencing cellular dynamics.
This surface feedback can be applied to finely tune and control diverse
biomaterial surface properties like wettability, reflectivity, and biomimetics.
The triggering of thermal effects, leading to the ejection of material with
subsequent solidification and formation of raised rims and 3D-like hollow
structures along the processed zones, demonstrated a direct correlation to the
wettability of the PLA. A transition from superhydrophobic (thetha > 150 deg.)
to super hydrophilic (thetha < 20 deg.) surfaces can be achieved by the
creation of grooves with V = 0.6 mm/s, F = 1.7 J/cm2. The achieved hierarchical
architecture affected morphology and thickness of the processed samples which
were linked to the nature of ultra-short laser-material interaction effects,
namely the precipitation of temperature distribution during material processing
can be strongly minimized with ultrashort pulses leading to non-thermal and
spatially localized effects that can facilitate volume ablation without
collateral thermal damage.

amplitude 10 times larger than would be expected if the companion were a

companion. The light curve also shows a clear reflection effect that is
well-modeled with a $2.5\,M_{\odot}$ main-sequence secondary, ruling out a

the system is a binary containing a stripped star orbiting the Be star: only a
triple model with an outer Be star can explain both the observed light curve

rotation velocity and presumed tidal synchronization were interpreted as
evidence for a low inclination (and thus a high companion mass), is far from

re-explore the scattering of gravitational waves in a spherically symmetric

reproduce the known result that the truncated effective theory exhibits
apparent time advances relative to the background geometry for specific

properly identifying the regime of validity of the effective theory, the
apparent time advance can be shown to be unresolvable. To illustrate this, we
identify specific higher-dimension operators in the EFT expansion which become
large for potentially resolvable time advances, rendering the EFT expansion
invalid. Our results demonstrate how staying within the confines of the EFT,
neither infrared nor asymptotic causality are ever violated for
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, no matter how low the scale, and furthermore its
causality can be understood without appealing to a precise UV completion such
as string theory.

with a depleted internal gate beneath the p-MOSFET. Charge transferred to the
internal gate modulates the source-drain current of the transistor. We have
developed a drain current readout module to characterize the detector. The
prototype sensor achieves a charge/current conversion gain of 700 pA per
electron, an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 15 electrons (e-) root mean

developed at Stanford, and the first characterization test results of the
SiSeRO prototypes. While at present only a proof-of-concept experiment, in the
near future we plan to use next generation sensors with improved noise
performance and an enhanced readout module. In particular, we are developing a
readout module enabling Repetitive Non-Destructive Readout (RNDR) of the
charge, which can in principle yield sub-electron ENC performance. With these
developments, we eventually plan to build a matrix of SiSeRO amplifiers to
develop an active pixel sensor with an on-chip ASIC-based readout system. Such
a system, with fast readout speeds and sub-electron noise, could be effectively
utilized in scientific applications requiring fast and low-noise

restore some of these modes due to the non-linear coupling between them and the
local small-scale clustering induced by gravitational collapse. We explore the
possibility of recovering information from the bispectrum between a photometric

calibrate the redshift distribution of the photometric sample to the required
accuracy of future experiments such as the Rubin Observatory, using future
single-dish and interferometric 21-cm observations, in situations where the
two-point function is not able to do so due to foreground contamination. We
also show how this calibration is affected by the photometric redshift width

measuring causal effects, robust conclusions about causal relationships can be
obtained using data from observational studies if proper statistical techniques
are used to account for the imbalance of pretreatment confounders across
groups. Propensity score (PS) and balance weighting are useful techniques that
aim to reduce the observed imbalances between treatment groups by weighting the
groups to be as similar as possible with respect to observed confounders.
Methods: We have created CoBWeb, a free and easy-to-use web application for the
estimation of causal treatment effects from observational data, using PS and
balancing weights to control for confounding bias. CoBWeb uses multiple
algorithms to estimate the PS and balancing weights, to allow for more flexible
relations between the treatment indicator and the observed confounders (as
different algorithms make different (or no) assumptions about the structural
relationship between the treatment covariate and the confounders). The optimal
algorithm can be chosen by selecting the one that achieves the best trade-off
between balance and effective sample size. Results: CoBWeb follows all the key
steps required for robust estimation of the causal treatment effect from
observational study data and includes sensitivity analysis of the potential
impact of unobserved confounders. We illustrate the practical use of the app
using a dataset derived from a study of an intervention for adolescents with
substance use disorder, which is available for users within the app
environment. Conclusion: CoBWeb is intended to enable non-specialists to
understand and apply all the key steps required to perform robust estimation of
causal treatment effects using observational data.

in generalizing the model trained in one task and applying it to other similar

exploited to obtain the speech signal in the context of other languages,
speakers, and environments. Recent domain adaptation research was developed
more effectively with various neural networks and high-level abstract features.
However, the related studies are more likely to transfer the well-trained model
from a rich and more diverse domain to a limited and similar domain. Therefore,
in this study, the domain adaptation method is proposed in unsupervised speech
enhancement for the opposite circumstance that transferring to a larger and
richer domain. On the one hand, the importance-weighting (IW) approach is
exploited with a variance constrained autoencoder to reduce the shift of shared
weights between the source and target domains. On the other hand, in order to
train the classifier with the worst-case weights and minimize the risk, the
minimax method is proposed. Both the proposed IW and minimax methods are
evaluated from the VOICE BANK and IEEE datasets to the TIMIT dataset. The

characterise the presence of ""quantum correlations"" between the subparts of a
given system. Whether a system behaves quantum-mechanically or classically is
believed to be impacted by the phenomenon of decoherence, which originates from
the unavoidable interaction between this system and an environment.
Generically, decoherence is associated with a decrease of the state purity,
i.e. a transition from a pure to a mixed state. In this paper, we investigate
how quantum discord is modified by this quantum-to-classical transition. This
study is carried out on systems described by quadratic Hamiltonians and
Gaussian states, with generalised squeezing parameters. A generic
parametrisation is also introduced to describe the way the system is
partitioned into two subsystems. We find that the evolution of quantum discord
in presence of an environment is a competition between the growth of the
squeezing amplitude and the decrease of the state purity. In phase space, this
corresponds to whether the semi-minor axis of the Wigner ellipse increases or
decreases, which has a clear geometrical interpretation. Finally, these
considerations are applied to primordial cosmological perturbations, thus
allowing us to investigate how large-scale structures in our universe, which
are believed to arise from quantum fluctuations, can exhibit classical
properties.

in a menstrual cycle in a longitudinal study, we propose a multi-kink quantile
regression model for longitudinal data analysis. It relaxes the linearity
condition and assumes different regression forms in different regions of the
domain of the threshold covariate. In this paper, we first propose a multi-kink
quantile regression for longitudinal data. Two estimation procedures are
proposed to estimate the regression coefficients and the kink points locations:
one is a computationally efficient profile estimator under the working
independence framework while the other one considers the within-subject
correlations by using the unbiased generalized estimation equation approach.
The selection consistency of the number of kink points and the asymptotic
normality of two proposed estimators are established. Secondly, we construct a
rank score test based on partial subgradients for the existence of kink effect
in longitudinal studies. Both the null distribution and the local alternative
distribution of the test statistic have been derived. Simulation studies show
that the proposed methods have excellent finite sample performance. In the
application to the longitudinal progesterone data, we identify two kink points
in the progesterone curves over different quantiles and observe that the
progesterone level remains stable before the day of ovulation, then increases
quickly in five to six days after ovulation and then changes to stable again or
even drops slightly

that has been studied by von Renesse and Scheutzow (2010), Scheutzow (2013),
Xie and Zhang (2020) and Mehri and Scheutzow (2021). This class of stochastic
Gronwall inequalities is a useful tool for SDEs.
  Our focus are convex generalizations of the Bihari-LaSalle type. The
constants we obtain are sharp. In particular, we provide new sharp constants
for the stochastic Gronwall inequalities. The proofs are connected to a
domination inequality by Lenglart (1977), an inequality by Pratelli (1976) and
a characterization of Lenglart's concept of domination via the Snell envelope.
  The inequalities we study appear for example in connection with exponential
moments of solutions to path-dependent SDEs: For non-path-dependent SDEs,
criteria for the finiteness of exponential moments are known. To be able to
extend these proofs to the path-dependent case, a convex generalization of a
stochastic Gronwall inequality seems necessary. Using the results of this
paper, we obtain a criterion for the finiteness of exponential moments which is
similar to that known for non-path-dependent SDEs.
  Stochastic Gronwall inequalities can also be applied to study other types of
SDEs than path-dependent SDEs: An estimate of this paper is applied by Agresti
and Veraar (2023) to prove global well-posedness for reaction-diffusion systems
with transport noise.

that, because these modes have the lowest oscillation frequencies of the

transportation system regarding pedestrian safety and mobility, e.g., Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems, and smart pedestrian crosswalk systems. Among all
pedestrian detection methods, vision-based detection method is demonstrated to
be the most effective in previous studies. However, the existing vision-based
pedestrian detection algorithms still have two limitations that restrict their
implementations, those being real-time performance as well as the resistance to
the impacts of environmental factors, e.g., low illumination conditions. To
address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight Illumination and
Temperature-aware Multispectral Network (IT-MN) for accurate and efficient
pedestrian detection. The proposed IT-MN is an efficient one-stage detector.
For accommodating the impacts of environmental factors and enhancing the
sensing accuracy, thermal image data is fused by the proposed IT-MN with visual
images to enrich useful information when visual image quality is limited. In
addition, an innovative and effective late fusion strategy is also developed to
optimize the image fusion performance. To make the proposed model implementable
for edge computing, the model quantization is applied to reduce the model size
by 75% while shortening the inference time significantly. The proposed
algorithm is evaluated by comparing with the selected state-of-the-art
algorithms using a public dataset collected by in-vehicle cameras. The results
show that the proposed algorithm achieves a low miss rate and inference time at
14.19% and 0.03 seconds per image pair on GPU. Besides, the quantized IT-MN
achieves an inference time of 0.21 seconds per image pair on the edge device,
which also demonstrates the potentiality of deploying the proposed model on
edge devices as a highly efficient pedestrian detection algorithm.

secondary atmospheres with unknown compositions. We use HyDRo to assess the
chemical constraints which can be placed on rocky exoplanet atmospheres using
JWST. Firstly, we identify the best currently-known rocky exoplanet candidates
for spectroscopic observations in thermal emission with JWST, finding >30 known
rocky exoplanets whose thermal emission will be detectable by JWST/MIRI in
fewer than 10 eclipses at R~10. We then consider the observations required to
characterise the atmospheres of three promising rocky exoplanets across the
~400-800 K equilibrium temperature range: Trappist-1 b, GJ 1132 b, and LHS 3844
b. Considering a range of CO_2- to H_2O-rich atmospheric compositions, we find
that as few as 8 eclipses of LHS 3844 b or GJ 1132 b with MIRI will be able to
place important constraints on the chemical compositions of their atmospheres.
This includes confident detections of CO_2 and H_2O in the case of a cloud-free
CO_2-rich composition, besides ruling out a bare rock scenario. Similarly, 30
eclipses of Trappist-1 b with MIRI/LRS can allow detections of a cloud-free

constraints for rocky exoplanets using JWST observations, providing clues about

other things) the following formula for the hyper-sums of powers of integers
$S_k^{(m)}(n)$ \begin{equation*} S_k^{(m)}(n) = \frac{1}{m!} \sum_{i=0}^{m}
(-1)^i \genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{m+n+1}{i+n+1}_{n+1} S_{k+i}(n), \end{equation*}

\cdots + n^k$. In this note we point out that a formula equivalent to the
preceding one was already established in a different form, namely, a form in
which $\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{m+n+1}{i+n+1}_{n+1}$ is given explicitly as a
polynomial in $n$ of degree $m-i$. We find out the connection between this
polynomial and the so-called $r$-Stirling polynomials of the first kind.
Furthermore, we determine the hyperharmonic polynomials and their successive

show the relationship between the (exponential) complete Bell polynomials and
the $r$-Stirling numbers of the first kind. Finally, we derive some identities

research. Conventional techniques for parameter inference and state estimation
typically rely on a precise definition of the state space and its dynamics.
While this is appropriate for rigid objects and robot states, it is challenging
to define the state space of a deformable object and how it evolves in time. In
this work, we pose the problem of inferring physical parameters of deformable
objects as a probabilistic inference task defined with a simulator. We propose
a novel methodology for extracting state information from image sequences via a
technique to represent the state of a deformable object as a distribution
embedding. This allows to incorporate noisy state observations directly into
modern Bayesian simulation-based inference tools in a principled manner. Our
experiments confirm that we can estimate posterior distributions of physical
properties, such as elasticity, friction and scale of highly deformable
objects, such as cloth and ropes. Overall, our method addresses the real-to-sim
problem probabilistically and helps to better represent the evolution of the

is the Unique Assembly Verification (UAV) problem. This algorithmic problem
asks whether a given tile system uniquely assembles a specific assembly. The
complexity of this problem in the 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM) at a constant
temperature is a long-standing open problem since the model was introduced.
Previously, only membership in the class coNP was known and that the problem is
in P if the temperature is one ($\tau=1$). The problem is known to be hard for
many generalizations of the model, such as allowing one step into the third
dimension or allowing the temperature of the system to be a variable, but the
most fundamental version has remained open.
  In this paper, we prove the UAV problem in the 2HAM is hard even with a small
constant temperature ($\tau = 2$), and finally answer the complexity of this
problem (open since 2013). Further, this result proves that UAV in the staged
self-assembly model is coNP-complete with a single bin and stage (open since
2007), and that UAV in the q-tile model is also coNP-complete (open since
2004). We reduce from Monotone Planar 3-SAT with Neighboring Variable Pairs, a
special case of 3SAT recently proven to be NP-hard. We accompany this reduction
with a positive result showing that UAV is solvable in polynomial time with the
promise that the given target assembly will have a tree-shaped bond graph,
i.e., contains no cycles. We provide a $\mathcal{O}(n^5)$ algorithm for UAV on
tree-bonded assemblies when the temperature is fixed to $2$, and a
$\mathcal{O}(n^5\log \tau)$ time algorithm when the temperature is part of the

applications. An image is first partitioned into patches, which are then used

cost of the attention mechanism, either a large patch size is used, resulting
in coarse-grained global interactions, or alternatively, attention is applied
only on a local region of the image, at the expense of long-range interactions.
In this work, we propose an approach that allows for both coarse global
interactions and fine-grained local interactions already at early layers of a

  At the core of our method is the application of local and global attention
layers. In the local attention layer, we apply attention to each patch and its
local shifts, resulting in virtually located local patches, which are not bound
to a single, specific location. These virtually located patches are then used
in a global attention layer. The separation of the attention layer into local
and global counterparts allows for a low computational cost in the number of
patches, while still supporting data-dependent localization already at the
first layer, as opposed to the static positioning in other visual transformers.

and opinions, and they exclude and discredit other viewpoints. This survey aims
to examine the echo chamber phenomenon on social media from a social computing
perspective and provide a blueprint for possible solutions. We survey the
related literature to understand the attributes of echo chambers and how they
affect the individual and society at large. Additionally, we show the
mechanisms, both algorithmic and psychological, that lead to the formation of
echo chambers. These mechanisms could be manifested in two forms: (1) the bias
of social media's recommender systems and (2) internal biases such as
confirmation bias and homophily. While it is immensely challenging to mitigate
internal biases, there has been great efforts seeking to mitigate the bias of
recommender systems. These recommender systems take advantage of our own biases
to personalize content recommendations to keep us engaged in order to watch
more ads. Therefore, we further investigate different computational approaches
for echo chamber detection and prevention, mainly based around recommender
systems.

of working memory (WM) study, in which a monkey must fixate its gaze on the
center of a screen and, following a brief cue that flashes on the screen, keep
fixating for several more seconds before shifting its gaze to the location
where the cue flashed. Consequently, in the delay period between the cue and
the response the monkey must maintain a memory of cue location.
Electrophysiological recordings from the prefrontal area of the cortex (PFC)
revealed neurons that display selective persistent activity: their firing rate
change induced by the cue persists through delay period, but only in response
to a confined range of cue locations. This suggests that the representation of
the cue is maintained in the network by a change in network activity profile.
In this work, we study a network of rate-model neurons that is capable of
preserving information about a past input, owing to structured connectivity and
nonlinearities in the neuronal transfer function (TFs). Particularly, we focus
on the acceleration of the TF close to firing threshold and the concavity
around TF saturation. Any memory mechanism which exploits TF saturation means
that some neurons must fire close to their saturation rates; with our model,
however, we show that a certain relation between the excitatory and inhibitory
neurons' TFs can cause an effective saturation in the network without forcing
the neurons into the saturating parts of their TFs. In addition, this mechanism
enables the erasure of memory at the end of the delay by a global excitatory
signal. Finally, we demonstrate the mechanism in a model network of spiking
neurons which describes with more detail the oscillatory dynamics in the state
transition due to the interaction of membrane and synaptic time constants which
is neglected in the rate model.

both single- and multi-field models, driven by scalar fields living on a

the inflection point is responsible for the growth of the power spectrum, while
in the multi-field set-up we study the effect of geometrical destabilisation
and non geodesic motion in field space. The two mechanisms can in principle be
distinguished through the spectral shape of the resulting scalar power spectrum
on small scales. These enhanced scalar perturbations can lead to primordial
black hole (PBH) production and second-order gravitational wave (GW)
generation. Due to the existence of universal predictions in
$\alpha$-attractors, consistency with current CMB constraints on the
large-scale spectral tilt implies that PBHs can only be produced with masses
smaller than $10^8\,\text{g}$ and are accompanied by ultra-high frequency GWs,
with a peak expected to be at frequencies of order $10\,\text{kHz}$ or above.

sequential manner. If trained with standard first-order methods most models
forget previously learned tasks when trained on a new task, which is often
referred to as catastrophic forgetting. A popular approach to overcome
forgetting is to regularize the loss function by penalizing models that perform
poorly on previous tasks. For example, elastic weight consolidation (EWC)
regularizes with a quadratic form involving a diagonal matrix build based on
past data. While EWC works very well for some setups, we show that, even under
otherwise ideal conditions, it can provably suffer catastrophic forgetting if
the diagonal matrix is a poor approximation of the Hessian matrix of previous
tasks. We propose a simple approach to overcome this: Regularizing training of
a new task with sketches of the Jacobian matrix of past data. This provably
enables overcoming catastrophic forgetting for linear models and for wide
neural networks, at the cost of memory. The overarching goal of this paper is
to provided insights on when regularization-based continual learning algorithms

computing when thermal noise is present. Interestingly, thermal noise has also
been known to play a central role in quantum thermodynamics (QTD). This fact
hints at the applicability of certain QTD statements in the QEC of thermal
noise, which has been discussed previously in the context of Maxwell's demon.
In this article, we view QEC as a quantum heat engine with a feedback
controller (i.e., a demon). We derive an upper bound on the measurement heat
dissipated during the error-identification stage in terms of the Groenewold
information gain, thereby providing the latter with a physical meaning also
when it is negative. Further, we derive the second law of thermodynamics in the
context of this QEC engine, operating with general quantum measurements.
Finally, we show that, under a set of physically motivated assumptions, this
leads to a fundamental triple trade-off relation, which implies a trade-off
between the maximum achievable fidelity of QEC and the super-Carnot efficiency
that heat engines with feedback controllers have been known to possess. A
similar trade-off relation occurs for the thermodynamic efficiency of the QEC
engine and the efficacy of the quantum measurement used for error
identification.

sequence, and has been studied for decades. While the LIS of a sequence of
length $n$ can be computed exactly in time $O(n\log n)$, the complexity of
estimating the (length of the) LIS in sublinear time, especially when LIS $\ll
n$, is still open.
  We show that for any integer $n$ and any $\lambda = o(1)$, there exists a
(randomized) non-adaptive algorithm that, given a sequence of length $n$ with
LIS $\ge \lambda n$, approximates the LIS up to a factor of $1/\lambda^{o(1)}$
in $n^{o(1)} / \lambda$ time.
  Our algorithm improves upon prior work substantially in terms of both
approximation and run-time: (i) we provide the first sub-polynomial
approximation for LIS in sub-linear time; and (ii) our run-time complexity
essentially matches the trivial sample complexity lower bound of
$\Omega(1/\lambda)$, which is required to obtain any non-trivial approximation
of the LIS.
  As part of our solution, we develop two novel ideas which may be of
independent interest: First, we define a new Genuine-LIS problem, where each
sequence element may either be genuine or corrupted. In this model, the user
receives unrestricted access to actual sequence, but does not know apriori
which elements are genuine. The goal is to estimate the LIS using genuine
elements only, with the minimal number of ""genuiness tests"". The second idea,
Precision Forest, enables accurate estimations for composition of general
functions from ""coarse"" (sub-)estimates. Precision Forest essentially
generalizes classical precision sampling, which works only for summations. As a
central tool, the Precision Forest is initially pre-processed on a set of
samples, which thereafter is repeatedly reused by multiple sub-parts of the
algorithm, improving their amortized complexity.

generation of these resonances. In this work, we show through ab initio
simulations of coupled light-matter systems that Fano interference phenomena
can be realized in a multimode photonic environment by strong coupling to the
electromagnetic continuum. Specifically, we show that by effectively enhancing
the light-matter coupling strength to the photon continuum in an experimentally
feasible way, we can achieve a transition from Lorentzian to Fano lines shapes
for both electronic and polaritonic excitations. An important outcome of
switching between these spectral signatures is the possibility to control the
Purcell enhancement of spontaneous emission alongside electromagnetically
induced transparency which is a special case of Fano resonances. Switching from
Fano back to a Lorentzian profile can be achieved by physically reducing the
coupling strength to the continuum of modes. Our results hold potential for
realizing tunable Fano resonances of molecules and materials interacting with

candidates for dark matter, with several viable production scenarios that make
different predictions. In the scenario in which the axion is born after
inflation, its field develops significant inhomogeneity and evolves in a highly
nonlinear fashion. Understanding the eventual abundance and distribution of
axionic dark matter in this scenario therefore requires dedicated numerical
simulations. So far the community has focused its efforts on simulations of the
QCD axion, a model that predicts a specific temperature dependence for the
axion mass. Here, we go beyond the QCD axion, and perform a suite of
simulations over a range of possible temperature dependencies labelled by a
power-law index. We study the complex dynamics of the axion field, including
the scaling of cosmic strings and domain walls, the spectrum of
non-relativistic axions, the lifetime and internal structure of axitons, and
the seeds of miniclusters. In particular, we quantify how much the string-wall
network contributes to the dark matter abundance as a function of how quickly
the axion mass grows. We find that a temperature-independent model produces
25\% more dark matter than the standard misalignment calculation. In contrast
to this generic ALP, QCD axion models are almost six times less efficient at
producing dark matter. Given the flourishing experimental campaign to search
for ALPs, these results have potentially wide implications for direct and
indirect searches.

encodes both points and relative poses between an object and a target (such as
a robot gripper or a rack used for hanging) via category-level descriptors. We
employ this representation for object manipulation, where given a task
demonstration, we want to repeat the same task on a new object instance from
the same category. We propose to achieve this objective by searching (via
optimization) for the pose whose descriptor matches that observed in the
demonstration. NDFs are conveniently trained in a self-supervised fashion via a
3D auto-encoding task that does not rely on expert-labeled keypoints. Further,
NDFs are SE(3)-equivariant, guaranteeing performance that generalizes across
all possible 3D object translations and rotations. We demonstrate learning of
manipulation tasks from few (5-10) demonstrations both in simulation and on a
real robot. Our performance generalizes across both object instances and 6-DoF
object poses, and significantly outperforms a recent baseline that relies on 2D
descriptors. Project website: https://yilundu.github.io/ndf/.

floor). Without this conditioning, Dobrushin showed in 1972 that typically most
of the interface is flat at height $0$. With the floor, for small $h$, the
model is expected to exhibit \emph{entropic repulsion}, where the typical
height of the interface lifts off of $0$. Detailed understanding of the SOS
model -- a more tractable height function approximation of 3D Ising -- due to
Caputo et al., suggests that there is a single integer value $-h_n^* \sim
-c\log n$ of the floor height, delineating the transition between rigidity at

  We identify an explicit $h_n^*=( c_\star+o(1))\log n$ such that, for the

$\epsilon(\beta)$-fraction of the sites are propelled to be above height $0$ if

Average Precision (AP), which captures the performance of localization and
classification sub-tasks simultaneously. However, due to the non-differentiable
nature of the AP metric, traditional object detectors adopt separate
differentiable losses for the two sub-tasks. Such a mis-alignment issue may
well lead to performance degradation. To address this, existing works seek to
design surrogate losses for the AP metric manually, which requires expertise
and may still be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose Parameterized AP Loss,
where parameterized functions are introduced to substitute the
non-differentiable components in the AP calculation. Different AP
approximations are thus represented by a family of parameterized functions in a
unified formula. Automatic parameter search algorithm is then employed to
search for the optimal parameters. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark

learning methods (e.g., MoCo, SimCLR) utilize both positive and negative
samples to guide the training direction; (2) asymmetric network methods (e.g.,
BYOL, SimSiam) get rid of negative samples via the introduction of a predictor
network and the stop-gradient operation; (3) feature decorrelation methods
(e.g., Barlow Twins, VICReg) instead aim to reduce the redundancy between
feature dimensions. These methods appear to be quite different in the designed
loss functions from various motivations. The final accuracy numbers also vary,
where different networks and tricks are utilized in different works. In this

Instead of comparing their loss functions, we derive a unified formula through

compare their performances. It turns out that there is little gap between these
methods, and the use of momentum encoder is the key factor to boost
performance. From this unified framework, we propose UniGrad, a simple but

models and their GAN-generated training data jointly end-to-end. We apply our
framework to the dense visual alignment problem. Inspired by the classic
Congealing method, our GANgealing algorithm trains a Spatial Transformer to map
random samples from a GAN trained on unaligned data to a common,
jointly-learned target mode. We show results on eight datasets, all of which
demonstrate our method successfully aligns complex data and discovers dense
correspondences. GANgealing significantly outperforms past self-supervised
correspondence algorithms and performs on-par with (and sometimes exceeds)
state-of-the-art supervised correspondence algorithms on several datasets --
without making use of any correspondence supervision or data augmentation and
despite being trained exclusively on GAN-generated data. For precise
correspondence, we improve upon state-of-the-art supervised methods by as much
as $3\times$. We show applications of our method for augmented reality, image
editing and automated pre-processing of image datasets for downstream GAN
training.

intractable problem on a quantum device. Natural proposals rely upon the
intrinsic hardness of classically simulating quantum mechanics; however,
verifying the output is itself classically intractable. On the other hand,
certain quantum algorithms (e.g. prime factorization via Shor's algorithm) are
efficiently verifiable, but require more resources than what is available on
near-term devices. One way to bridge the gap between verifiability and
implementation is to use ""interactions"" between a prover and a verifier. By
leveraging cryptographic functions, such protocols enable the classical
verifier to enforce consistency in a quantum prover's responses across multiple
rounds of interaction. In this work, we demonstrate the first implementation of
an interactive quantum advantage protocol, using an ion trap quantum computer.
We execute two complementary protocols -- one based upon the learning with
errors problem and another where the cryptographic construction implements a
computational Bell test. To perform multiple rounds of interaction, we
implement mid-circuit measurements on a subset of trapped ion qubits, with
subsequent coherent evolution. For both protocols, the performance exceeds the
asymptotic bound for classical behavior; maintaining this fidelity at scale
would conclusively demonstrate verifiable quantum advantage.

simulations of molecular clouds and galaxies is highly challenging. Simulations
on very small scales can be sufficiently well resolved to consistently follow
the formation of individual stars, whilst on larger scales sinks that have
masses sufficient to fully sample the IMF can be converted into realistic
stellar populations. However, as yet, these methods do not work for
intermediate scale resolutions whereby sinks are more massive compared to
individual stars but do not fully sample the IMF. In this paper, we introduce
the grouped star formation prescription, whereby sinks are first grouped
according to their positions, velocities, and ages, then stars are formed by
sampling the IMF using the mass of the groups. We test our grouped star
formation method in simulations of various physical scales, from sub-parsec to
kilo-parsec, and from static isolated clouds to colliding clouds. With suitable
grouping parameters, this star formation prescription can form stars that
follow the IMF and approximately mimic the original stellar distribution and
velocity dispersion. Each group has properties that are consistent with a
star-forming region. We show that our grouped star formation prescription is
robust and can be adapted in simulations with varying physical scales and
resolution. Such methods are likely to become more important as galactic or
even cosmological scale simulations begin to probe sub-parsec scales.

the precise nature of this relation and its scatter remains to be understood
fully, especially for low-mass galaxies. We analyse the galaxy-halo size
relation for low-mass ($M_\star \sim 10^{7-9} {\rm M_\odot}$) central galaxies
over the past 12.5 billion years with the help of cosmological volume
simulations (FIREbox) from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE)
project. We find a nearly linear relationship between the half-stellar mass
galaxy size $R_{1/2}$ and the parent dark matter halo virial radius $R_{\rm
vir}$. This relation evolves only weakly since redshift $z = 5$: $R_{1/2} {\rm
kpc} = (0.053\pm0.002)(R_{\rm vir}/35 {\rm kpc})^{0.934\pm0.054}$, with a
nearly constant scatter $\langle \sigma \rangle = 0.084 [{\rm dex}]$. Whilst
this ratio is similar to what is expected from models where galaxy disc sizes
are set by halo angular momentum, the low-mass galaxies in our sample are not
angular momentum supported, with stellar rotational to circular velocity ratios
$v_{\rm rot} / v_{\rm circ} \sim 0.15$. Introducing redshift as another
parameter to the GHSR does not decrease the scatter. Furthermore, this scatter
does not correlate with any of the halo properties we investigate -- including
spin and concentration -- suggesting that baryonic processes and feedback
physics are instead critical in setting the scatter in the galaxy-halo size
relation. Given the relatively small scatter and the weak dependence of the
galaxy-halo size relation on redshift and halo properties for these low-mass
central galaxies, we propose using galaxy sizes as an independent method from
stellar masses to infer halo masses.

$m\simeq 10^{-5}{\rm eV}$ and quartic self-coupling $\lambda\lesssim10^{-19}$

the hydrodynamic limit, we find that the accretion rate is bounded from below,

$M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ we have $\dot{M}_{\rm min}\simeq1.41\times 10^{-9}~{\rm

$\rho_0(r) \propto r^{-1.20}$ near the sound horizon, $\rho_0(r) \propto

Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy using the spherical Jeans Equation and
Fisher matrix formalism. We show that radial velocity measurements for 1000
individual stars can constrain the mass contained within the effective radius
of a dSph to within 5%. This is consistent with constraints extracted from
current observational data. We demonstrate that a minimum sample of 100,000
(10,000) stars with both radial and proper motions measurements is required to
distinguish between a cusped or cored inner slope at the 2-sigma (1-sigma)
level. If using the log-slope measured at the half-light radius as a proxy for
differentiating between a core or cusp slope, only 1000 line-of-sight and
proper motions measurements are required, however, we show this choice of
radius does not always unambiguously differentiate between core and cusped
profiles. Once observational errors are below half the value of the intrinsic
dispersion, improving the observational precision yields little change in the
density profile uncertainties. The choice of priors in our profile shape
analysis plays a crucial role when the number of stars in a system is less than
100, but does not affect the resulting uncertainties for larger kinematic
samples. Our predicted 2D confidence regions agree well with those from a full
likelihood analysis run on a mock kinematic dataset taken from the Gaia

modular invariance immediately give a set of seemingly consistent partition
functions at a given genus. We then find that higher genus constraints, plus
consistency under degeneration limits of the Riemann surface, greatly reduces
the number of possible code CFTs. This work provides a step towards a full

outbursts. Type I outbursts occur each orbital period while type II outbursts
have a period and duration that are not related to any periodicity of the
binary system. Type II outbursts may be caused by mass transfer to the neutron
star from a highly eccentric Be star disk. A sufficiently misaligned Be star
decretion disk undergoes secular Von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations of
eccentricity and inclination. Observations show that in some systems the type
II outbursts come in pairs with the second being of lower luminosity. We use
numerical hydrodynamical simulations to explore the dynamics of the highly
misaligned disk that forms around the neutron star as a consequence of mass
transfer from the Be star disk. We show that the neutron star disk may also be
ZLK unstable and that the eccentricity growth leads to an enhancement in the
accretion rate onto the neutron star that lasts for several orbital periods,
resembling a type II outburst. We suggest that in a type II outburst pair, the
first outburst is caused by mass transfer from the eccentric Be star disk while
the second and smaller outburst is caused by the eccentric neutron star disk.
We find that the timescale between outbursts in a pair may be compatible with
the observed estimates.

imperfections under realistic assumptions are crucial for the development of
quantum computers. Gate set tomography is a characterization approach that
simultaneously and self-consistently extracts a tomographic description of the
implementation of an entire set of quantum gates, as well as the initial state
and measurement, from experimental data. Obtaining such a detailed picture of
the experimental implementation is associated with high requirements on the
number of sequences and their design, making gate set tomography a challenging
task even for only two qubits.
  In this work, we show that low-rank approximations of gate sets can be
obtained from significantly fewer gate sequences and that it is sufficient to
draw them randomly. Such tomographic information is needed for the crucial task
of dealing with coherent noise. To this end, we formulate the data processing
problem of gate set tomography as a rank-constrained tensor completion problem.
We provide an algorithm to solve this problem while respecting the usual
positivity and normalization constraints of quantum mechanics by using
second-order geometrical optimization methods on the complex Stiefel manifold.
Besides the reduction in sequences, we demonstrate numerically that the
algorithm does not rely on structured gate sets or an elaborate circuit design
to robustly perform gate set tomography. Therefore, it is more flexible than
traditional approaches. We also demonstrate how coherent errors in shadow
estimation protocols can be mitigated using estimates from gate set tomography.

quantized density of states (DoS) in classical wave systems. While these
fractional DoS have associated states localized to the disclination's core,
such states are not protected from deconfinement due to the breaking of chiral
symmetry, generally leading to resonances which, even in principle, have finite
lifetimes and suboptimal confinement. Here, we devise and experimentally
validate in acoustic lattices a paradigm by which topological states bind to
disclinations without a fractional DoS but which preserve chiral symmetry. The
preservation of chiral symmetry pins the states at the mid-gap, resulting in
their protected maximal confinement. The integer DoS at the defect results in
two-fold degenerate states that, due to symmetry constraints, do not gap out.
Our study provides a fresh perspective on the interplay between
symmetry-protection in topological phases and topological defects, with
possible applications in classical and quantum systems alike.

richness, richness concentration, width and location of the red sequence,
colour, luminosity, and dominance of the brightest cluster galaxy. We use
SDSS-DR12 photometry and our analysis factors out the mass dependency to derive
trends at fixed cluster mass. Clusters of low surface brightness for their mass
have cluster richness in spite of their group-like luminosity. Gas-poor, low
X-ray surface brightness, X-ray faint clusters for their mass, display 25\%
lower richness for their mass at $4.4\sigma$ level. Therefore, richness and
quantities depending on gas, such as gas fraction, $M_{gas}$, and X-ray surface
brightness, are covariant at fixed halo mass. In particular, we do not confirm
the hint of an anti-correlation of hot and cold baryons at fixed mass put forth
in literature. All the remaining optical properties show no covariance at fixed
mass, within the sensitivities allowed by our data and sample size. We conclude
that X-ray and optical properties are disjoint, the optical properties not
showing signatures of those processes involving gas content, apart from the
richness-mass scaling relation. The covariance between X-ray surface brightness

non-Hermitian systems, the spectral winding topology yields quantized
steady-state response. By considering two weakly coupled non-Hermitian chains,
we discover that the spectral winding topology of one chain can be probed by a
steady-state response defined solely on the other chain, even when other
important properties, e.g., {energetics} and entanglement entropy, indicate
that eigen-solutions are effectively {not hybridized} between the two chains.
This intriguing phenomenon, as carefully investigated in a large parameter

interchain signal propagation in a non-Hermitian setting but also reveals
unexpected physics of spectral winding topology vs quantized response.

the proportional representation of agents' opinions is an important and
well-studied desideratum. Existing criteria for evaluating the

sufficiently large and cohesive groups are ''represented'' in the sense that
candidates approved by some group members are selected. Crucially, these
criteria say nothing about the representation of individual agents, even if
these agents are members of groups that deserve representation. In this paper,
we formalize the concept of individual representation (IR) and explore to which

checking whether an IR outcome exists is computationally intractable, and we
verify that all common approval-based voting rules may fail to provide IR even

establish an interesting contrast between ''voter interval'' and ''candidate

facilities, health event prediction with deep learning has gained more and more
attention. A common feature of EHR data used for deep-learning-based
predictions is historical diagnoses. Existing work mainly regards a diagnosis
as an independent disease and does not consider clinical relations among
diseases in a visit. Many machine learning approaches assume disease
representations are static in different visits of a patient. However, in real
practice, multiple diseases that are frequently diagnosed at the same time
reflect hidden patterns that are conducive to prognosis. Moreover, the
development of a disease is not static since some diseases can emerge or
disappear and show various symptoms in different visits of a patient. To
effectively utilize this combinational disease information and explore the
dynamics of diseases, we propose a novel context-aware learning framework using
transition functions on dynamic disease graphs. Specifically, we construct a
global disease co-occurrence graph with multiple node properties for disease
combinations. We design dynamic subgraphs for each patient's visit to leverage
global and local contexts. We further define three diagnosis roles in each
visit based on the variation of node properties to model disease transition
processes. Experimental results on two real-world EHR datasets show that the
proposed model outperforms state of the art in predicting health events.

keep pushing their detection horizons, it is important to assess coupled GW/EM
probabilities, and how to maximize observational prospects. Here we perform
population synthesis calculations of BNS evolution with the code MOBSE, and
seed the binaries in galaxies at three representative redshifts (z=0.01,0.1,1)
of the Illustris TNG50 simulation. The binaries are evolved and their locations
numerically tracked in the host galactic potentials until merger. Adopting the
astrophysical parameters of GRB170817A as a prototype, we numerically compute
the broadband lightcurves of jets from BNS mergers, with the afterglow
brightness depending on the local medium density at the merger sites. We
perform Monte Carlo simulations of the resulting EM population assuming either
a random viewing angle with respect to the jet, or a jet aligned with the
orbital angular momentum of the binary, which biases the viewing angle
probability for GW-triggered events. We find that ~70-80% of BNSs from z=0.01
should be detectable in gamma-rays. The afterglow detection probabilities of
GW-triggered BNS mergers vary between ~0.3-0.7%, with higher values for jets
aligned with the BNS angular momentum, and are comparable across the high and
low-energy bands, unlike gamma-ray-triggered events (cosmological SGRBs) which
are significantly brighter at higher energies. We further quantify
observational biases with respect to host galaxy masses.

our results with affine predictions, where stress redistribution is by

catalog contains 438 AHB stars, classified and interpreted in the context of
post-HB evolution as follows: (1) AHB1: 280 stars fainter than $M_V=-0.8$,
evolving redward from the blue HB (BHB) toward the base of the AGB. (2)
Post-AGB (PAGB): 13 stars brighter than $M_V\simeq-2.75$, departing from the
top of the AGB and evolving rapidly blueward. (3) AHB2: 145 stars, with
absolute magnitudes between those of the AHB1 and PAGB groups. This last
category includes a mixture of objects leaving the extreme BHB and evolving
toward the AGB, and brighter ones moving back from the AGB toward higher
temperatures. Among the AHB1 stars are 59 RR Lyrae interlopers, observed by
chance in our survey near maximum light. PAGB and AHB2 stars (including W
Virginis Cepheids) overwhelmingly belong to GCs containing BHB stars, in
accordance with predictions of post-HB evolutionary tracks. We suggest that
most W Vir variables are evolving toward lower temperatures and are in their
first crossings of the instability strip. Non-variable yellow PAGB stars show
promise as a Population II standard candle for distance measurement.

a much stronger driver of long-term inequality than earnings volatility. Our
findings show that the dynamical effects of statistical fluctuations in growth

training-time attacks that cause models to ""spin"" their outputs so as to
support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view -- but only when the
input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned
summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the
name of some individual or organization.
  Model spinning introduces a ""meta-backdoor"" into a model. Whereas
conventional backdoors cause models to produce incorrect outputs on inputs with
the trigger, outputs of spinned models preserve context and maintain standard
accuracy metrics, yet also satisfy a meta-task chosen by the adversary.
  Model spinning enables propaganda-as-a-service, where propaganda is defined
as biased speech. An adversary can create customized language models that
produce desired spins for chosen triggers, then deploy these models to generate
disinformation (a platform attack), or else inject them into ML training
pipelines (a supply-chain attack), transferring malicious functionality to
downstream models trained by victims.
  To demonstrate the feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new
backdooring technique. It stacks an adversarial meta-task onto a seq2seq model,
backpropagates the desired meta-task output to points in the word-embedding
space we call ""pseudo-words,"" and uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output
distribution of the seq2seq model. We evaluate this attack on language
generation, summarization, and translation models with different triggers and
meta-tasks such as sentiment, toxicity, and entailment. Spinned models largely
maintain their accuracy metrics (ROUGE and BLEU) while shifting their outputs

the description of historical events may be qualitative as well as

developed an approach based on the identification of patterns. To detect a

of patterns is what makes cliophysics possible and ensures its success. Briefly

nonlinear systems is practically important. This paper aims at exploring the
skill of a rich class of nonlinear stochastic models, known as the conditional
Gaussian nonlinear system (CGNS), as both a cheap surrogate model and a fast
preconditioner for facilitating many computationally challenging tasks. The
CGNS preserves the underlying physics to a large extent and can reproduce
intermittency, extreme events and other non-Gaussian features in many complex
systems arising from practical applications. Three interrelated topics are
studied. First, the closed analytic formulae of solving the conditional
statistics provide an efficient and accurate data assimilation scheme. It is
shown that the data assimilation skill of a suitable CGNS approximate forecast
model outweighs that by applying an ensemble method even to the perfect model
with strong nonlinearity, where the latter suffers from filter divergence.
Second, the CGNS allows the development of a fast algorithm for simultaneously
estimating the parameters and the unobserved variables with uncertainty
quantification in the presence of only partial observations. Utilizing an
appropriate CGNS as a preconditioner significantly reduces the computational
cost in accurately estimating the parameters in the original complex system.
Finally, the CGNS advances rapid and statistically accurate algorithms for
computing the probability density function and sampling the trajectories of the
unobserved state variables. These fast algorithms facilitate the development of
an efficient and accurate data-driven method for predicting the linear response
of the original system with respect to parameter perturbations based on a
suitable CGNS preconditioner.

identified in the context of a new variational problem with two constraints.
The advantage of this variational problem is that its non-degenerate local
minimizers are stable in the time evolution of the mKdV equation, whereas the
saddle points are unstable. We explore the analytical representation of
periodic waves given by Jacobi elliptic functions and compute numerically
critical points of the constrained variational problem. A broken pitchfork
bifurcation of three smooth solution families is found. Two families represent
(stable) minimizers of the constrained variational problem and one family

Additionally, a method compensating the gas gain drop due to space charge at
high $\gamma$-background hit flux by adjusting the sMDT operating voltage will

restoration circuits in the front-end electronics chips in order to suppress
signal-pile-up effects at high counting rates further leads to significant
improvement of both efficiency and resolution. Extensive tests using sMDT test

examine how stellar migration and satellite infall shape the AMR across the
disk. We find in the simulation, similar to the MW, the AMR in small spatial
regions (R, z) shows turning points that connect changes in the direction of
the relations. The turning points in the AMR in the simulation, are a signature
of late satellite infall. This satellite infall has a mass radio similar as
that of the Sagittarius dwarf to the MW (~ 0.001). Stars in the apex of the
turning points are young and have nearly not migrated. The late satellite
infall creates the turning points via depositing metal-poor gas in the disk,
triggering star formation of stars in a narrow metallicity range compared to
the overall AMR. The main effect of radial migration on the AMR turning points
is to widen the metallicity range of the apex. This can happen when radial
migration brings stars born from the infallen gas in other spatial bins, with
slightly different metallicities, into the spatial bin of interest. These
results indicate that it is possible that the passage of the Sagittarius dwarf

transitions from the environment. For example, in the problem of plasma control
for nuclear fusion, computing the next state for a given state-action pair
requires querying an expensive transition function which can lead to many hours
of computer simulation or dollars of scientific research. Such expensive data
collection prohibits application of standard RL algorithms which usually
require a large number of observations to learn. In this work, we address the
problem of efficiently learning a policy while making a minimal number of
state-action queries to the transition function. In particular, we leverage
ideas from Bayesian optimal experimental design to guide the selection of
state-action queries for efficient learning. We propose an acquisition function
that quantifies how much information a state-action pair would provide about
the optimal solution to a Markov decision process. At each iteration, our
algorithm maximizes this acquisition function, to choose the most informative
state-action pair to be queried, thus yielding a data-efficient RL approach. We
experiment with a variety of simulated continuous control problems and show
that our approach learns an optimal policy with up to $5$ -- $1,000\times$ less
data than model-based RL baselines and $10^3$ -- $10^5\times$ less data than
model-free RL baselines. We also provide several ablated comparisons which

effective exponents of the percolation transitions as well as the corresponding
time thresholds, extrapolated to the infinite system size, are

effects between the two limiting regimes of the system. We also find that the
universal scaling functions governing the critical behavior in every single

shown promising results in long-range climate forecasting, the associated model

late fusion approach that systematically combines the predictions from multiple
models to reduce the expected errors of the fused results. We also propose a
network architecture with the novel denormalization layer to gain the benefits
of data normalization without actually normalizing the data. The experimental

outperforms the 30-year climate normals, and the accuracy can be improved by

ocular circulation. However, simulating dyes governed by convection-diffusion

analysis approach for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. Such
simulations can be used to identify the relative significance of different
spatial subregions in particular time intervals of interest in an unsteady flow
field. Additionally, dye evolution is closely related to non-discrete particle
residence time (PRT) calculations that are governed by similar PDEs. PRT is a
widely used metric for various fluid dynamics applications (e.g., environmental
fluids, biological flows) and is a well-accepted biomarker for cardiovascular

a pseudo-spectral method based on Fourier continuation (FC) for conducting dye

adopted for this purpose because of its simplicity and expandability to higher
dimensions. However, it is cost-inefficient when applied to high-resolution
simulations because standard FoF implementation leads to too many distance
calculations in dense regions. We confirm this through our exercise of applying
the 6-dimensional (6D) FoF galaxy finder code, VELOCIraptor (Elahi et al.
2019), on the NewHorizon simulation (Dubois et al. 2021). The high particle
resolution of NewHorizon ($M_{\rm star} \sim 10^4 M_{\odot}$) allows a large
central number density ($10^{6}\,{\rm kpc}^{-3}$) for typical galaxies,
resulting in a few days to weeks of galaxy searches for just one snapshot. Even
worse, we observed a significant decrease in the FoF performance in the
high-dimensional 6D searches: ""the curse of dimensionality"" problem. To
overcome these issues, we have developed several implementations that can be
readily applied to any tree-based FoF code. They include limiting visits to
tree nodes, re-ordering the list of particles for searching neighbor particles,
and altering the tree structure. Compared to the run with the original code,
the new run with these implementations results in the identical galaxy

(exposure/outcome generated from main-effects regressions) and complex (models
also included interactions) scenarios, alongside two missingness mechanisms
(different in whether the outcome influenced missingness in other variables).
Parametric MI including interaction terms performed best across all settings in
terms of bias and variance reduction. Non-MI methods had the largest variance
and, like MI using machine-learning, had larger biases when the outcome
influenced missingness in other variables. Parametric MI without interactions -
the default in most MI software - had the largest bias in the complex scenario.
When choosing a method to handle missing data in the context of TMLE with

solid surfaces is an spontaneous process that leads to a rather compact layer
of randomly oriented molecules. Due to the importance of this process for the
development of catalytic surfaces, a number of existing computational and
experimental approaches try to predict and control the orientation of such
molecules. However, and despite their own advantages, these tend to be either
too expensive computationally, or oversimplified, undermining their ability to
predict the most appropriate experimental conditions to maximize the catalytic
activity of adsorbed proteins. To address this current need, we present an
efficient computational approach to model the behavior of proteins near
surfaces in the presence of an external electric field, based on continuum
electrostatics. Our model can not only estimate the overall affinity of the
protein with the surface, but also their most likely orientation as a function
of the potential applied. In this way, a rational selection of the potential
can be performed to maximize the accessibility of the protein's active site to
the solvent. The model relies on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and was
implemented in an extension of the code PyGBe that includes an external
electric field, and renders the electrostatic component of the solvation free
energy. To demonstrate the feasibility of this technique, we investigate the
adsorption of trypsin onto a carbon electrode under potentiostatic conditions
both numerically and experimentally. We found that even though the adsorption
process is largely dominated by hydrophobic effects, the orientation of trypsin
can be controlled through an external potential, influencing the position of
the active sites, and resulting in an important change in the catalytic
activity of the surface.

combined with a classical result of Erd\H{o}s and Lehner on integer partitions,
implies that the limiting Betti distribution for the Hilbert schemes
$(\mathbb{C}^2)^{[n]}$ on $n$ points, as $n\rightarrow +\infty,$ is a
\textit{Gumbel distribution}. In view of this example, they ask for further
such Betti distributions. We answer this question for the quasihomogeneous
Hilbert schemes $((\mathbb{C}^2)^{[n]})^{T_{\alpha,\beta}}$ that are cut out by
torus actions. We prove that their limiting distributions are also of Gumbel
type. To obtain this result, we combine work of Buryak, Feigin, and Nakajima on
these Hilbert schemes with our generalization of the result of Erd\H{o}s and
Lehner, which gives the distribution of the number of parts in partitions that
are multiples of a fixed integer $A\geq 2.$ Furthermore, if $p_k(A;n)$ denotes
the number of partitions of $n$ with exactly $k$ parts that are multiples of
$A$, then we obtain the asymptotic
  $$
  p_k(A,n)\sim \frac{24^{\frac k2-\frac14}(n-Ak)^{\frac

generalizes to allow us to compute the expected value of $\pi(1)$ for

exploits the notion of Randomized Block Coordinate Descent to explore the

industrial applications, such as combustion, food industry, and drug
encapsulation. An intriguing phenomenon associated with this process is the
occurrence of singular jets that are up to dozens of times faster than the
impact velocity. These jets break into micro-droplets, which can produce
aerosols and affect the quality of printing technologies. Here, we investigate
experimentally and numerically the jetting process after a coaxial water-in-oil
compound drop impacts on a glass substrate with different releasing heights and
volumetric ratios. After impact, the water core spreads and retracts, giving
rise to a vertical jet initially made of oil. For certain values of the
impacting velocity, high speed and very thin jets are observed, the so-called
singular jets. Depending on the volumetric ratio, one or two velocity peaks can
be observed when varying the impact velocity, triggered by the contraction
dynamics of a deep and cylindrical cavity. The self-similar time-evolution of
the collapse for the first singularity regime follows a 1/2 power law in time,
which can be derived from bubble pinch-off. In contrast, the collapse at the
second peak follows a 2/3 power law, which can be accounted for by a balance

problems, especially in the linear inverse problems in infinite-dimensional
setting where the unknowns are functions. In such problems, choosing an
appropriate prior distribution is an important task. In particular, when the
function to infer has much detail information, such as many sharp jumps,
corners, and the discontinuous and nonsmooth oscillation, the so-called total
variation-Gaussian (TG) prior is proposed in function space to address it.
However, the TG prior is easy to lead the blocky (staircase) effect in
numerical results. In this work, we present a fractional order-TG (FTG) hybrid
prior to deal with such problems, where the fractional order total variation
(FTV) term is used to capture the detail information of the unknowns and
simultaneously uses the Gaussian measure to ensure that it results in a
well-defined posterior measure. For the numerical implementations of linear
inverse problems in function spaces, we also propose an efficient independence
sampler based on a transport map, which uses a proposal distribution derived
from a diagonal map, and the acceptance probability associated to the proposal
is independent of discretization dimensionality. And in order to take full
advantage of the transport map, the hierarchical Bayesian framework is applied
to flexibly determine the regularization parameter. Finally we provide some
numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the FTG prior and the
efficiency and robustness of the proposed independence sampler method.

image-to-image translation where typical image-to-image translation methods
synthesize a new image in a different domain given an image. To the best of our
knowledge, the EVCI dataset is the first EV charging inlet dataset. For the

is also important to perceive and model -- inter-object functional
relationships (e.g., a switch on the wall turns on or off the light, a remote
control operates the TV). Humans often spend little or no effort to infer these
relationships, even when entering a new room, by using our strong prior
knowledge (e.g., we know that buttons control electrical devices) or using only
a few exploratory interactions in cases of uncertainty (e.g., multiple switches
and lights in the same room). In this paper, we take the first step in building
AI system learning inter-object functional relationships in 3D indoor
environments with key technical contributions of modeling prior knowledge by
training over large-scale scenes and designing interactive policies for
effectively exploring the training scenes and quickly adapting to novel test

potential in attaining dexterous behaviours for robotics, they tend to make
errors when deployed in the real world due to mismatches between the training
and execution environments. In contrast, the classical robotics community have
developed a range of controllers that can safely operate across most states in
the real world given their explicit derivation. These controllers however lack
the dexterity required for complex tasks given limitations in analytical
modelling and approximations. In this paper, we propose Bayesian Controller
Fusion (BCF), a novel uncertainty-aware deployment strategy that combines the
strengths of deep RL policies and traditional handcrafted controllers. In this
framework, we can perform zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, where our uncertainty
based formulation allows the robot to reliably act within out-of-distribution
states by leveraging the handcrafted controller while gaining the dexterity of
the learned system otherwise. We show promising results on two real-world
continuous control tasks, where BCF outperforms both the standalone policy and
controller, surpassing what either can achieve independently. A supplementary
video demonstrating our system is provided at https://bit.ly/bcf_deploy.

inverse graphics approaches to 3D understanding to be utilized in modern
machine learning frameworks. Explicit shape representations (voxels, point
clouds, or meshes), while relatively easily rendered, often suffer from limited
geometric fidelity or topological constraints. On the other hand, implicit
representations (occupancy, distance, or radiance fields) preserve greater
fidelity, but suffer from complex or inefficient rendering processes, limiting
scalability. In this work, we endeavour to address both shortcomings with a
novel shape representation that allows fast differentiable rendering within an
implicit architecture. Building on implicit distance representations, we define
Directed Distance Fields (DDFs), which map an oriented point (position and
direction) to surface visibility and depth. Such a field can render a depth map
with a single forward pass per pixel, enable differential surface geometry
extraction (e.g., surface normals and curvatures) via network derivatives, be
easily composed, and permit extraction of classical unsigned distance fields.
Using probabilistic DDFs (PDDFs), we show how to model inherent discontinuities
in the underlying field. Finally, we apply our method to fitting single shapes,
unpaired 3D-aware generative image modelling, and single-image 3D
reconstruction tasks, showcasing strong performance with simple architectural
components via the versatility of our representation.

autonomous driving. Due to the fact that it is difficult to manually annotate a
qualitative large-scale 3D point cloud dataset, unsupervised domain adaptation
(UDA) is popular in 3D point cloud learning which aims to transfer the learned
knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain.
However, the generalization and reconstruction errors caused by domain shift
with simply-learned model are inevitable which substantially hinder the model's
capability from learning good representations. To address these issues, we
propose an end-to-end self-ensembling network (SEN) for 3D point cloud domain
adaption tasks. Generally, our SEN resorts to the advantages of Mean Teacher
and semi-supervised learning, and introduces a soft classification loss and a
consistency loss, aiming to achieve consistent generalization and accurate
reconstruction. In SEN, a student network is kept in a collaborative manner
with supervised learning and self-supervised learning, and a teacher network
conducts temporal consistency to learn useful representations and ensure the
quality of point clouds reconstruction. Extensive experiments on several 3D
point cloud UDA benchmarks show that our SEN outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods on both classification and segmentation tasks. Moreover, further
analysis demonstrates that our SEN also achieves better reconstruction results.

the Volatility Index (VIX) and the volatility risk premium (VRP). The Realized
GARCH model is driven by two shocks, a return shock and a volatility shock, and
these are natural state variables in the stochastic discount factor (SDF). The
volatility shock endows the exponentially affine SDF with a compensation for
volatility risk. This leads to dissimilar dynamic properties under the physical
and risk-neutral measures that can explain time-variation in the VRP. In an
empirical application with the S&P 500 returns, the VIX, and the VRP, we find
that the Realized GARCH model significantly outperforms conventional GARCH
models.

framework to improve the correlation performance between two image signals. The
basic idea behind the SBCC is that an optimized surrogate filter/image,
supplanting one original image, will produce a more robust and more accurate
correlation signal. The cross-correlation estimation of the SBCC is
formularized with an objective function composed of surrogate loss and
correlation consistency loss. The closed-form solution provides an efficient
estimation. To our surprise, the SBCC framework could provide an alternative
view to explain a set of generalized cross-correlation (GCC) methods and
comprehend the meaning of parameters. With the help of our SBCC framework, we
further propose four new specific cross-correlation methods, and provide some
suggestions for improving existing GCC methods. A noticeable fact is that the
SBCC could enhance the correlation robustness by incorporating other negative
context images. Considering the sub-pixel accuracy and robustness requirement
of particle image velocimetry (PIV), the contribution of each term in the
objective function is investigated with particles' images. Compared with the
state-of-the-art baseline methods, the SBCC methods exhibit improved
performance (accuracy and robustness) on the synthetic dataset and several
challenging real experimental PIV cases.

quantifier alternations. We tackle scalability issues that arise due to the
large search space of quantified invariants by combining a breadth-first search
strategy and a new syntactic form for quantifier-free bodies. The breadth-first
strategy prevents inductive generalization from getting stuck in regions of the
search space that are expensive to search and focuses instead on lemmas that
are easy to discover. The new syntactic form is well-suited to lemmas with
quantifier alternations by allowing both limited conjunction and disjunction in
the quantifier-free body, while carefully controlling the size of the search
space. Combining the breadth-first strategy with the new syntactic form results
in useful inductive bias by prioritizing lemmas according to: (i) well-defined
syntactic metrics for simple quantifier structures and quantifier-free bodies,
and (ii) the empirically useful heuristic of preferring lemmas that are fast to
discover. On a benchmark suite of primarily distributed protocols and complex
Paxos variants, we demonstrate that our algorithm can solve more of the most
complicated examples than state-of-the-art techniques.

in practice via a number of mature software platforms. Implementation of
differentially private (DP) mechanisms has to be done carefully to ensure
end-to-end security guarantees. In this paper we study two implementation flaws
in the noise generation commonly used in DP systems. First we examine the
Gaussian mechanism's susceptibility to a floating-point representation attack.
The premise of this first vulnerability is similar to the one carried out by
Mironov in 2011 against the Laplace mechanism. Our experiments show attack's
success against DP algorithms, including deep learning models trained using
differentially-private stochastic gradient descent.
  In the second part of the paper we study discrete counterparts of the Laplace
and Gaussian mechanisms that were previously proposed to alleviate the
shortcomings of floating-point representation of real numbers. We show that
such implementations unfortunately suffer from another side channel: a novel
timing attack. An observer that can measure the time to draw (discrete) Laplace
or Gaussian noise can predict the noise magnitude, which can then be used to
recover sensitive attributes. This attack invalidates differential privacy
guarantees of systems implementing such mechanisms.
  We demonstrate that several commonly used, state-of-the-art implementations
of differential privacy are susceptible to these attacks. We report success
rates up to 92.56% for floating point attacks on DP-SGD, and up to 99.65% for
end-to-end timing attacks on private sum protected with discrete Laplace.
Finally, we evaluate and suggest partial mitigations.

representative selection of most broadly used algorithms for Navier-Stokes
equations on this set of problems. Where applicable, we compare the most common
spatial discretization choices (unstructured triangle/tetrahedral meshes and
structured or semi-structured quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes).
  The study shows that while the type of spatial discretization used has a
minor impact on the accuracy of the solutions, the choice of time integration
method, spatial discretization order, and the choice of solving the coupled
equations or reducing them to simpler subproblems have very different
properties. Methods that are directly solving the original equations tend to be
more accurate than splitting approaches for the same number of degrees of
freedom, but numerical or computational difficulty arise when they are scaled
to larger problem sizes. Low-order splitting methods are less accurate, but
scale more easily to large problems, while higher-order splitting methods are
accurate but require dense time discretizations to be stable.
  We release the description of the experiments and an implementation of our

verification of implicit neural networks; our framework blends together mixed
monotone systems theory and contraction theory. First, given an implicit neural
network, we introduce a related embedded network and show that, given an
$\ell_\infty$-norm box constraint on the input, the embedded network provides
an $\ell_\infty$-norm box overapproximation for the output of the given
network. Second, using $\ell_{\infty}$-matrix measures, we propose sufficient
conditions for well-posedness of both the original and embedded system and
design an iterative algorithm to compute the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm box
robustness margins for reachability and classification problems. Third, of
independent value, we propose a novel relative classifier variable that leads
to tighter bounds on the certified adversarial robustness in classification
problems. Finally, we perform numerical simulations on a Non-Euclidean Monotone

compare the accuracy and run time of our mixed monotone contractive approach

reported. Rare isotopes produced at RIBF, $^{127}$Sn, $^{126}$In, $^{125}$Cd,
$^{124}$Ag, $^{123}$Pd, were injected in R3. Masses of $^{126}$In, $^{125}$Cd,

improved. This is the first reported measurement with a new storage ring mass
spectrometery technique realized at a heavy-ion cyclotron and employing
individual injection of the pre-identified rare nuclei. The latter is essential
for the future mass measurements of the rarest isotopes produced at RIBF. The
impact of the new $^{123}$Pd result on the solar $r$-process abundances in a
neutron star merger event is investigated by performing reaction network
calculations of 20 trajectories with varying electron fraction $Y_e$. It is
found that the neutron capture cross section on $^{123}$Pd increases by a
factor of 2.2 and $\beta$-delayed neutron emission probability,
$P_\mathrm{1n}$, of $^{123}$Rh increases by 14\%. The neutron capture cross
section on $^{122}$Pd decreases by a factor of 2.6 leading to pileup of
material at $A=122$, thus reproducing the trend of the solar $r$-process
abundances. The trend of the two-neutron separation energies (S$_\mathrm{2n}$)

improved uncertainty excludes large changes of the S$_\mathrm{2n}$ value at

discovered a red, tidally-stretched star cluster positioned ~5 arcseconds (~400
pc in projection) from, and pointing toward the center of, the post-merger
spiral galaxy NGC 4424. The star cluster, which we refer to as `Nikhuli', has a
near-infrared luminosity of (6.88+/-1.85)x10^6 L_{solar,F160W} and likely
represents the nucleus of a captured/wedded galaxy. Moreover, from our Chandra
X-ray Observatory image, Nikhuli is seen to contain a high-energy X-ray point
source, with L_{0.5-8 keV} = 6.31^{+7.50}_{-3.77}x10^{38} erg/s (90%
confidence). We argue that this is more likely to be an active massive black
hole than an X-ray binary. Lacking an outward-pointing comet-like appearance,
the stellar structure of Nikhuli favors infall rather than the ejection from a
gravitational-wave recoil event. A minor merger with a low-mass early-type
galaxy may have sown a massive black hole, aided an X-shaped pseudobulge, and
be sewing a small bulge. The stellar mass and the velocity dispersion of NGC
4424 predict a central black hole of (0.6-1.0)x10^5 M_solar, similar to the
expected intermediate-mass black hole in Nikhuli, and suggestive of a black
hole supply mechanism for bulgeless late-type galaxies. We may potentially be
witnessing black hole seeding by capture and sinking, with a nuclear star

surfaces. For folding-based methods, their data flow is large, convergence
speed is slow, and they are also hard to handle the generation of non-smooth
surfaces. In this work, we propose AXform, an attention-based method to
transform latent features to point clouds. AXform first generates points in an
interim space, using a fully connected layer. These interim points are then
aggregated to generate the target point cloud. AXform takes both parameter
sharing and data flow into account, which makes it has fewer outliers, fewer
network parameters, and a faster convergence speed. The points generated by
AXform do not have the strong 2-manifold constraint, which improves the
generation of non-smooth surfaces. When AXform is expanded to multiple branches
for local generations, the centripetal constraint makes it has properties of
self-clustering and space consistency, which further enables unsupervised
semantic segmentation. We also adopt this scheme and design AXformNet for point
cloud completion. Considerable experiments on different datasets show that our

surfaces have reflectivity properties that are very similar to those of the
surrounding regions. To overcome these problems, we propose a generative
adversarial network based segmentation framework with uncertainty attention
unit and refinement module embedded in the generator. The refinement module,
composed of edge and reverse attention units, is designed to refine the
predicted building map. The edge attention enhances the boundary features to
estimate building boundaries with greater precision, and the reverse attention
allows the network to explore the features missing in the previously estimated
regions. The uncertainty attention unit assists the network in resolving
uncertainties in classification. As a measure of the power of our approach, as
of December 4, 2021, it ranks at the second place on DeepGlobe's public
leaderboard despite the fact that main focus of our approach -- refinement of
the building edges -- does not align exactly with the metrics used for
leaderboard rankings. Our overall F1-score on DeepGlobe's challenging dataset
is 0.745. We also report improvements on the previous-best results for the

sequential information at every timestep as in conventional recurrent neural

model capable of detailed sequential learning in partial observable settings.
The proposed model builds an additional learning network to efficiently

  In this work we offer three algorithms for the bf O-LOCAL class of problems

these algorithms requires only $O(\Delta^{1+\epsilon})$ clock rounds for some
constant $\epsilon>0$ but still only $O(\log \Delta)$ awake time which improves

utilized class activation maps (CAMs) to localize the class objects. However,
since a classification loss is insufficient for providing precise object
regions, CAMs tend to be biased towards discriminative patterns (i.e.,
sparseness) and do not provide precise object boundary information (i.e.,
impreciseness). To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework
(composed of MainNet and SupportNet.) that derives pixel-level self-supervision
from given image-level supervision. In our framework, with the help of the
proposed Regional Contrastive Module (RCM) and Multi-scale Attentive Module
(MAM), MainNet is trained by self-supervision from the SupportNet. The RCM
extracts two forms of self-supervision from SupportNet: (1) class region masks
generated from the CAMs and (2) class-wise prototypes obtained from the
features according to the class region masks. Then, every pixel-wise feature of
the MainNet is trained by the prototype in a contrastive manner, sharpening the
resulting CAMs. The MAM utilizes CAMs inferred at multiple scales from the
SupportNet as self-supervision to guide the MainNet. Based on the dissimilarity
between the multi-scale CAMs from MainNet and SupportNet, CAMs from the MainNet
are trained to expand to the less-discriminative regions. The proposed method
shows state-of-the-art WSSS performance both on the train and validation sets
on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. For reproducibility, code will be available
publicly soon.

artificial spin systems. However, observation of such phenomena and related
collective spin-wave signatures have until recently proved elusive or limited
to low-power edge-modes which are difficult to measure experimentally. Here we
describe the requisite conditions for dipolar mode-hybridisation, how it may be
controlled, why it was not observed earlier and how strong coupling may occur
between nanomagnet bulk-modes. We experimentally investigate four
nano-patterned artificial spin system geometries: `chevron' arrays, `square',
`staircase' and `brickwork' artificial spin ices. We observe significant
dynamic dipolar-coupling in all systems with relative coupling strengths and
avoided-crossing gaps supported by micromagnetic-simulation results. We
demonstrate reconfigurable mode-hybridisation regimes in each system via
microstate control, and in doing so elucidate the underlying dynamics governing
dynamic dipolar-coupling with implications across reconfigurable magnonics. We
demonstrate that confinement of the bulk-modes via edge effects play a critical
role in dipolar hybridised-modes, and treating nanoislands as a coherently
precessing macro-spins or standing spin-waves are insufficient to capture
experimentally-observed coupling phenomena. Finally, we present a
parameter-space search detailing how coupling strength may be tuned via
nanofabrication-dimensions and material properties.

to those in its local neighbourhood: so-called `local outlier methods', such as
LOF and DBSCAN. They are popular for their simple principles and strong
performance on unstructured, feature-based data that is commonplace in many
practical applications. However, they cannot learn to adapt for a particular
set of data due to their lack of trainable parameters. In this paper, we begin
by unifying local outlier methods by showing that they are particular cases of
the more general message passing framework used in graph neural networks. This
allows us to introduce learnability into local outlier methods, in the form of
a neural network, for greater flexibility and expressivity: specifically, we
propose LUNAR, a novel, graph neural network-based anomaly detection method.
LUNAR learns to use information from the nearest neighbours of each node in a
trainable way to find anomalies. We show that our method performs significantly
better than existing local outlier methods, as well as state-of-the-art deep
baselines. We also show that the performance of our method is much more robust
to different settings of the local neighbourhood size.

nontrivial, depending on its detailed configuration, and one needs to carefully

applications. Here, we theoretically study and experimentally demonstrate the
second Chern crystal in a four-dimensional space by introducing two extra
synthetic translation dimensions. Due to the inherently nontrivial topology of
the synthetic translation space, this abstract four-dimensional crystal is
guaranteed to be topologically nontrivial regardless of the detailed
configuration. The dimensional hierarchy of gapless boundary modes can be
deduced by dimension reduction. Remarkably, one-dimensional gapless dislocation
modes are observed and their robustness is confirmed in our experiments. This
ubiquitous phenomenon in synthetic translation space provides perspectives on
the findings of topologically nontrivial crystals and inspires the designs of

DMI constant D, while in the second system also the sample morphology was
modulated. Due to the folding property of the band structure in the dispersion
relations of the magnonic crystals it is possible to extend the sensitivity of
Brillouin light scattering towards weak DMI strength (D in the range from 0 to
0.5 mJ/m2), by measuring the frequency splitting of folded modes in high-order
artificial Brillouin zones, since the splitting increases almost linearly with
the band index. For relatively large values of the DMI (D in the range from 1.0

positive wavevectors, separated by forbidden frequency gaps whose amplitude

those observations, various hyperfine components of the 2,0,2-1,0,1 rotational
transition, at 37.5 GHz, were detected using the Yebes 40m telescope. Here, we
used the IRAM 30m telescope to detect ten hyperfine components of the
5,0,5-4,0,4 rotational transition, lying at 93.6 GHz. The observed frequencies
differ by 0.2 MHz with respect to the predictions from available laboratory
data. This difference is significant for a radioastronomical search for CH2CCH
in interstellar sources with narrow lines. We thus included the measured
frequencies in a new spectroscopic analysis to provide accurate frequency
predictions for the interstellar search for propargyl at mm wavelengths.
Moreover, we recommend that future searches for CH2CCH in cold interstellar
clouds are carried out at lambda 3 mm, rather than at lambda 8 mm. The
5,0,5-4,0,4 transition is about five times more intense than the 2,0,2-1,0,1
one in TMC-1, which implies that detecting the former requires about seven
times less telescope time than detecting the latter. We constrain the
rotational temperature of CH2CCH in TMC-1 to 9.9 +/- 1.5 K, which indicates
that the rotational levels of this species are thermalized at the gas kinetic
temperature. The revised value of the column density of CH2CCH (including ortho
and para species) is (1.0 +/- 0.2)e14 cm-2, and thus the CH2CCH/CH3CCH
abundance ratio is revised from slightly below one to nearly one. This study

  In this work, we propose the hierarchical graph summarization model, which is
an expressive graph representation model that includes the previous one
proposed by Navlakha et al. as a special case. The new model represents an
unweighted graph using positive and negative edges between hierarchical
supernodes, each of which can contain others. Then, we propose Slugger, a
scalable heuristic for concisely and exactly representing a given graph under
our new model. Slugger greedily merges nodes into supernodes while maintaining
and exploiting their hierarchy, which is later pruned. Slugger significantly
accelerates this process by sampling, approximation, and memoization. Our
experiments on 16 real-world graphs show that Slugger is (a) Effective:
yielding up to 29.6% more concise summary than state-of-the-art lossless
summarization methods, (b) Fast: summarizing a graph with 0.8 billion edges in
a few hours, and (c) Scalable: scaling linearly with the number of edges in the
input graph.

(or verb) category in an image (e.g., buying) and detecting all corresponding
semantic roles (e.g., agent and goods), is an essential step towards
""human-like"" event understanding. Since each verb is associated with a specific
set of semantic roles, all existing GSR methods resort to a two-stage
framework: predicting the verb in the first stage and detecting the semantic
roles in the second stage. However, there are obvious drawbacks in both stages:
1) The widely-used cross-entropy (XE) loss for object recognition is
insufficient in verb classification due to the large intra-class variation and
high inter-class similarity among daily activities. 2) All semantic roles are
detected in an autoregressive manner, which fails to model the complex semantic
relations between different roles. To this end, we propose a novel SituFormer
for GSR which consists of a Coarse-to-Fine Verb Model (CFVM) and a
Transformer-based Noun Model (TNM). CFVM is a two-step verb prediction model: a
coarse-grained model trained with XE loss first proposes a set of verb
candidates, and then a fine-grained model trained with triplet loss re-ranks
these candidates with enhanced verb features (not only separable but also
discriminative). TNM is a transformer-based semantic role detection model,
which detects all roles parallelly. Owing to the global relation modeling
ability and flexibility of the transformer decoder, TNM can fully explore the
statistical dependency of the roles. Extensive validations on the challenging
SWiG benchmark show that SituFormer achieves a new state-of-the-art performance
with significant gains under various metrics. Code is available at

existing works mostly focus on investigating the adversarial transferability

cross-modal transferability of adversarial perturbation has never been
explored. This paper investigates the transferability of adversarial
perturbation across different modalities, i.e., leveraging adversarial
perturbation generated on white-box image models to attack black-box video
models. Specifically, motivated by the observation that the low-level feature
space between images and video frames are similar, we propose a simple yet
effective cross-modal attack method, named as Image To Video (I2V) attack. I2V
generates adversarial frames by minimizing the cosine similarity between
features of pre-trained image models from adversarial and benign examples, then
combines the generated adversarial frames to perform black-box attacks on video
recognition models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that I2V can achieve high
attack success rates on different black-box video recognition models. On
Kinetics-400 and UCF-101, I2V achieves an average attack success rate of 77.88%

Most of existing methods ignore the complexity of the graph structures and
restrict graphs in a single constant-curvature representation space, which is
only suitable to particular kinds of graph structure indeed. Additionally,
these methods follow the supervised or semi-supervised learning paradigm, and
thereby notably limit their deployment on the unlabeled graphs in real
applications. To address these aforementioned limitations, we take the first
attempt to study the self-supervised graph representation learning in the
mixed-curvature spaces. In this paper, we present a novel Self-supervised
Mixed-curvature Graph Neural Network (SelfMGNN). Instead of working on one
single constant-curvature space, we construct a mixed-curvature space via the
Cartesian product of multiple Riemannian component spaces and design
hierarchical attention mechanisms for learning and fusing the representations
across these component spaces. To enable the self-supervisd learning, we
propose a novel dual contrastive approach. The mixed-curvature Riemannian space
actually provides multiple Riemannian views for the contrastive learning. We
introduce a Riemannian projector to reveal these views, and utilize a
well-designed Riemannian discriminator for the single-view and cross-view
contrastive learning within and across the Riemannian views. Finally, extensive
experiments show that SelfMGNN captures the complicated graph structures in
reality and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Building upon our recent spectroscopy work on these objects, here we
characterise them to determine their real nature and check if they are
different from the rest of the blazar population. For the first time we also
present a systematic study of the frequency of masquerading BL Lacs, i.e.
flat-spectrum radio quasars with their broad lines swamped by non-thermal jet
emission, in a $\gamma$-ray- and IceCube-selected sample, finding a fraction
$>$ 24 per cent and possibly as high as 80 per cent. In terms of their
broad-band properties, our sources appear to be indistinguishable from the rest

neutrino emission, one in which neutrinos are produced in interactions of
protons with jet photons and one in which the target photons are from the broad
line region. Both scenarios can equally account for the neutrino-blazar
correlation observed by some of us. Future observations with neutrino
telescopes and X-ray satellites will test them out.

behaviors, has attracted increasing research interest in the past decades. This
paper pushes the state of the art by proposing a novel generative hybrid CF
model, which achieves high accuracy in characterizing dynamic human CF
behaviors and is able to generate realistic human CF behaviors for any given
observed or even unobserved driving style. Specifically, the ability of
accurately capturing human CF behaviors is ensured by designing and calibrating
an Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with time-varying parameters. The reason
behind is that such time-varying parameters can express both the inter-driver
heterogeneity, i.e., diverse driving styles of different drivers, and the
intra-driver heterogeneity, i.e., changing driving styles of the same driver.
The ability of generating realistic human CF behaviors of any given observed
driving style is achieved by applying a neural process (NP) based model. The
ability of inferring CF behaviors of unobserved driving styles is supported by
exploring the relationship between the calibrated time-varying IDM parameters
and an intermediate variable of NP. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed models, we conduct extensive experiments and comparisons, including CF
model parameter calibration, CF behavior prediction, and trajectory simulation
for different driving styles.

responses of both films are linear elastic under low strain gradient but
nonlinear elastic under high strain gradient. In the linear elastic regime, no

internal displacements of atoms of the (111) film are much larger than those of
the (100) film, the obtained flexoelectric coefficient of the (111) film is

wave function, traditional mesh-based algorithms suffer from ""the curse of
dimensionality"", which gives rise to more severe computational burden when the
semiclassical parameter \(\ep\) is small. The Frozen Gaussian sampling
outperforms the existing algorithms in that it is mesh-free in computing the
physical observables and is suitable for high dimensional problems. In this
work, we provide detailed procedures to implement the FGS for both Gaussian and
WKB initial data cases, where the sampling strategies on the phase space
balance the need of variance reduction and sampling convenience. Moreover, we
rigorously prove that, to reach a certain accuracy, the number of samples
needed for the FGS is independent of the scaling parameter \(\ep\).
Furthermore, the complexity of the FGS algorithm is of a sublinear scaling with
respect to the microscopic degrees of freedom and, in particular, is
insensitive to the dimension number. The performance of the FGS is validated
through several typical numerical experiments, including simulating scattering
by the barrier potential, formation of the caustics and computing the
high-dimensional physical observables without mesh.

fundamental ingredient for predicting accurate molecular abundances in
astronomical environments. Quantitative values of diffusivity and diffusion
barriers usually rely heavily on empirical rules. In this paper, we compute the
diffusion coefficients of adsorbed nitrogen atoms by combining machine-learned
interatomic potentials, metadynamics, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. With
this approach, we obtain a diffusion coefficient of nitrogen atoms on the
surface of amorphous solid water of merely $(3.5 \pm
1.1)10^{-34}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$ at 10 K for a bare ice surface. Thus, we find that
nitrogen, as a paradigmatic case for light and weakly bound adsorbates, is
unable to diffuse on bare amorphous solid water at 10 K. Surface coverage has a
strong effect on the diffusion coefficient by modulating its value over 9--12
orders of magnitude at 10 K and enables diffusion for specific conditions. In
addition, we have found that atom tunneling has a negligible effect. Average
diffusion barriers of the potential energy surface (2.56 kJ mol$^{-1}$) differ
strongly from the effective diffusion barrier obtained from the diffusion
coefficient for a bare surface (6.06 kJ mol$^{-1}$) and are, thus,
inappropriate for diffusion modeling. Our findings suggest that the thermal
diffusion of N on water ice is a process that is highly dependent on the
physical conditions of the ice.

posteriori probability estimators of GPs conditioned on the partial
differential equation (PDE) system of the MFG at a finite number of sample
points. The main bottleneck of the GP method is to compute the inverse of a
square gram matrix, whose size is proportional to the number of sample points.
To improve the performance, we introduce the FF method, whose insight comes
from the recent trend of approximating positive definite kernels with random
Fourier features. The FF algorithm seeks approximated solutions in the space
generated by sampled Fourier features. In the FF method, the size of the matrix
to be inverted depends only on the number of Fourier features selected, which
is much less than the size of sample points. Hence, the FF method reduces the
precomputation time, saves the memory, and achieves comparable accuracy to the
GP method. We give the existence and the convergence proofs for both
algorithms. The convergence argument of the GP method does not depend on any
monotonicity condition, which suggests the potential applications of the GP
method to solve MFGs with non-monotone couplings in future work. We show the
efficacy of our algorithms through experiments on a stationary MFG with a
non-local coupling and on a time-dependent planning problem. We believe that
the FF method can also serve as an alternative algorithm to solve general PDEs.

setting. Let $G$ be an arbitrary given graph, $p \in (0, 1]$ a parameter of the
problem, and let $G_p$ be a random subgraph that includes each edge of $G$
independently with probability $p$. We are unaware of the realization $G_p$,
but can learn if an edge $e$ exists in $G_p$ by querying it. The goal is to
find an approximate minimum vertex cover (MVC) of $G_p$ by querying few edges
of $G$ non-adaptively.
  This stochastic setting has been studied extensively for various problems
such as minimum spanning trees, matroids, shortest paths, and matchings. To our
knowledge, however, no non-trivial bound was known for MVC prior to our work.
In this work, we present a:
  * $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation for general graphs which queries
$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^3 p})$ edges per vertex, and a
  * $1.367$-approximation for bipartite graphs which queries $poly(1/p)$ edges
per vertex.
  Additionally, we show that at the expense of a triple-exponential dependence
on $p^{-1}$ in the number of queries, the approximation ratio can be improved
down to $(1+\epsilon)$ for bipartite graphs.
  Our techniques also lead to improved bounds for bipartite stochastic
matching. We obtain a $0.731$-approximation with nearly-linear in $1/p$
per-vertex queries. This is the first result to break the prevalent $(2/3 \sim

in the theory with three massless quarks. The calculation is carried out by
Monte Carlo simulations on the lattice by considering large spatial extensions
in order to have negligible finite volume effects. For each temperature we have
simulated 3 or 4 values of the lattice spacing, so as to perform the continuum
limit extrapolation with confidence at a few permille accuracy. Chiral symmetry
restoration manifests itself in our results through the degeneracy of the
vector and the axial vector channels and of the scalar and the pseudoscalar
ones. In the entire range of temperatures explored, the meson screening masses
deviate from the free theory result, $2 \pi T$, by at most a few percent. These
deviations, however, cannot be explained by the known leading term in the QCD
coupling constant $g$ up to the highest temperature, where other contributions
are still very relevant. In particular the vector-pseudoscalar mass splitting
turns out to be of $O(g^4)$ in the entire range explored, and it remains
clearly visible up to the highest temperature, where the two screening masses
are still significantly different within our numerical precision. The pattern
of different contributions that we have found explains why it has been
difficult in the past to match non-perturbative lattice results at $T \sim 1$

Our results indicate that high-resolution x-ray structural analysis with the
accuracy of 0.01 \AA is feasible even with intense x-ray pulses by making the

determine the precise rise position of the current due to the possible

However, it is not enough to guarantee EF1 since the allocation of empty

maximum utilitarian social welfare (USW). In general finding, USW allocations

smaller in the GTDGL model. This difference is attributed to the current
redistribution effect, which reduces the current density in weak points of the
superconductor and counteracts the current crowding effect. We numerically
investigate the effect of fill factor on the critical current in a meander and
conclude that the reduction of critical current is low enough to justify fill

  We show that this kind of hardness can only appear if mixing weights are
allowed to be exponentially small, and that for polynomially lower bounded
mixing weights non-trivial algorithmic guarantees are possible in
quasi-polynomial time. Concretely, we develop an algorithm based on the
sum-of-squares method with running time quasi-polynomial in the minimum mixing
weight. The algorithm can reliably distinguish between a mixture of $k\ge 2$
well-separated Gaussian components and a (pure) Gaussian distribution. As a
certificate, the algorithm computes a bipartition of the input sample that
separates a pair of mixture components, i.e., both sides of the bipartition
contain most of the sample points of at least one component.
  For the special case of colinear means, our algorithm outputs a
$k$-clustering of the input sample that is approximately consistent with the
components of the mixture. We obtain similar clustering guarantees also for the

particles. The recent experimental demonstration of Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) of light in dye-filled microcavities has opened the intriguing
possibility to build photonic simulators of solid-state systems, with potential
advantages over their atomic counterpart. A distinctive feature of photon BEC
is the thermo-optical nature of the effective photon-photon interaction, which
is intrinsically nonlocal and can thus induce interactions of arbitrary range.
This offers the opportunity to systematically study the collective behaviour of
many-body systems with tunable interaction range. In this paper, we
theoretically study the effect of nonlocal interactions in photon BEC. We first
present numerical results of BEC in a double-well potential, and then extend
our analysis to a short one-dimensional lattice with open boundaries. By
resorting to a numerical procedure inspired by the Newton-Raphson method, we
simulate the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equation and provide evidence of
surface localization induced by nonlocality, where the condensate density is
localized at the boundaries of the potential. Our work paves the way towards
the realization of synthetic matter with photons, where the interplay between
long-range interactions and low dimensionality can lead to the emergence of

previous prescriptions in that: (i) the generic Newtonian contribution is
factored out from each multipole; (ii) the circular part is factored out and
resummed using standard EOB methods and (iii) the residual, 2PN-accurate,
noncircular part, and in particular the tail contribution, is additionally

$e=0.9$, or dynamical captures . The resummation of the noncircular tail
contribution is found essential to obtain excellent (${\lesssim}0.05$~rad at
periastron for $e=0.9$) analytical/numerical agreement and to considerably
improve the prescription with just the Newtonian prefactor. In the comparable

previous Newtonian factorization, though yielding maximal unfaithfulness

dynamical systems. In particular, the implicit quantification of the
uncertainty of the learned model makes it a promising approach for
safety-critical applications. When using Gaussian process regression to learn
unknown systems, a commonly considered approach consists of learning the
residual dynamics after applying some generic discretization technique, which
might however disregard properties of the underlying physical system.
Variational integrators are a less common yet promising approach to
discretization, as they retain physical properties of the underlying system,
such as energy conservation and satisfaction of explicit kinematic constraints.
In this work, we present a novel structure-preserving learning-based modelling
approach that combines a variational integrator for the nominal dynamics of a
mechanical system and learning residual dynamics with Gaussian process
regression. We extend our approach to systems with known kinematic constraints
and provide formal bounds on the prediction uncertainty. The simulative
evaluation of the proposed method shows desirable energy conservation
properties in accordance with general theoretical results and demonstrates
exact constraint satisfaction for constrained dynamical systems.

reliability to meet the demands of modern tasks. These requirements specially
apply to cameras onboard such vehicles because they are the predominant sensors
to acquire information about the environment and support actions. Cameras must
maintain proper functionality and take automatic countermeasures if necessary.
However, few works examine the practical use of a general condition monitoring
approach for cameras and designs countermeasures in the context of an envisaged
high-level application. We propose a generic and interpretable
self-health-maintenance framework for cameras based on data- and

Furthermore, we demonstrate on a real-world ground vehicle how one can adjust
the camera parameters to achieve optimal whole-system capability based on
experimental (non-linear and non-monotonic) input-output performance curves,
using object detection, motion blur and sensor noise as examples. Our framework
not only provides a practical ready-to-use solution to evaluate and maintain
the health of cameras, but can also serve as a basis for extensions to tackle
more sophisticated problems that combine additional data sources (e.g., sensor

photometric monitoring campaign for HIP 113201 and for GJ 282AB, the two wide K
star companions to HIP 36985, using the 40 cm Remote Observatory Atacama Desert
(ROAD) telescope. We adopt ages of 1.2$\pm$0.1 Gyr for HIP 113201AB and
750$\pm$100 Myr for HIP 36985AB. To derive dynamical masses for all components
of these systems, we used parallel-tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling
to fit a combination of radial velocity, direct imaging, and Gaia and Hipparcos
astrometry. Fitting the direct imaging and radial velocity data for HIP 113201
yields a primary mass of 0.54$\pm$0.03 M$_{\odot}$, fully consistent with its
M1 spectral type, and a secondary mass of 0.145$\pm$ M$_{\odot}$. The secondary
masses derived with and without including Hipparcos/Gaia data are more massive
than the 0.1 M$_{\odot}$ estimated mass from the photometry of the companion.
An undetected brown dwarf companion to HIP 113201B could be a natural
explanation for this apparent discrepancy. At an age $>$1 Gyr, a 30 M$_{Jup}$
companion to HIP 113201B would make a negligible ($<$1$\%$) contribution to the
system luminosity, but could have strong dynamical impacts. Fitting the direct
imaging, radial velocity, and Hipparcos/Gaia proper motion anomaly for HIP
36985AB, we find a primary mass of 0.54$\pm$0.01 M$_{\odot}$ and a secondary
mass of 0.185$\pm$0.001 M$_{\odot}$ which agree well with photometric estimates
of component masses, the masses estimated from $M_{K}$-- mass relationships for
M dwarf stars, and previous dynamical masses in the literature.

quantum field theory. However, the family of homogenous sine-Gordon models
provides a rare example where both stable and unstable bound states are present
in the spectrum whilst the scattering matrix is diagonal and solves the usual
bootstrap equations. In the standard scattering picture, unstable particles
result from complex poles of the $S$-matrix located in the unphysical sheet of
rapidity space. Since they are not part of the asymptotic spectrum, their
presence is only felt through the effect they have on physical quantities
associated either to the theory as a whole (i.e.~scaling functions, correlation
functions) or to the stable particles themselves (i.e.~energy/particle
density). In two recent publications, the effect of unstable particles in
different out-of-equilibrium settings has been studied. It has been shown that
their presence is associated with specific signatures in many quantities of
physical interest. A good way to select those quantities is to adopt the
generalised hydrodynamic approach and to consider the effective velocities and
particle densities of the stable particles in the theory. For an initial state
given by a spacial gaussian profile of temperatures peaked at the origin, time
evolution gives rise to particle and spectral particle densities that exhibit
hallmarks of the creation and decay of unstable particles. While these
signatures have been observed numerically elsewhere, this paper explores their
quantitative and qualitative dependence on the parameters of the problem. We

and bilayer black phosphorus in the vicinity of a charged defect. In
particular, we combine screened defect potentials obtained from
first-principles linear response theory with large-scale tight-binding
simulations to calculate the wavefunctions and energies of bound acceptor and
donor states. As a consequence of the anisotropic band structure, the defect
states in these systems form distorted hydrogenic orbitals with a different
ordering than in isotropic materials. For the monolayer, we study the
dependence of the binding energies of charged adsorbates on the defect height
and the dielectric constant of a substrate in an experimental setup. We also
compare our results to an anisotropic effective mass model and find
quantitative and qualitative differences when the charged defect is close to
the black phosphorus or when the screening from the substrate is weak. For the
bilayer, we compare results for charged adsorbates and charged intercalants and
find that intercalants induce more prominent secondary peaks in the local
density of states because they interact strongly with electronic states on both
layers. These new insights can be directly tested in scanning tunneling
spectroscopy measurements and enable a detailed understanding of the role of
Coulomb impurities in electronic devices.

transport occurrence on Mars substantially. While previous wind tunnel
experiments and numerical simulations addressed how particle trajectories may
be affected by external electric fields, the effect of sand electrification
remains uncertain. Here we show, by means of wind tunnel simulations under air
pressure of 20 mbar, that the presence of electric charges on the particle
surface can reduce the minimal threshold wind shear velocity for the initiation
of sand transport, u*ft, significantly. In our experiments, we considered
different samples, a model system of glass beads as well as a Martian soil
analog, and different scenarios of triboelectrification. Furthermore, we
present a model to explain the values of u*ft obtained in the wind tunnel that
is based on inhomogeneously distributed surface charges. Our results imply that
particle transport that subsides, once the wind shear velocity has fallen below
the threshold for sustained transport, can more easily be restarted on Mars

functionality rather than security, and today it still applies in many sectors
and applications. However, there is an increasing number of security threats
over ES, and a successful attack could have economical, physical or even human
consequences, since many of them are used to control critical applications. A
standardized and general accepted security testing framework is needed to
provide guidance, common reporting forms, and the possibility to compare the
results along the time. This can be achieved by introducing security metrics
into the evaluation or assessment process. If carefully designed and chosen,
metrics could provide a quantitative, repeatable and reproducible value that
would reflect the level of security protection of the ES. This paper analyzes
the features that a good security metric should exhibit, introduces a taxonomy
for classifying them, and finally, it carries out a literature survey on
security metrics for the security evaluation of ES. In this review, more than
500 metrics were collected and analyzed. Then, they were reduced to 169 metrics
that have the potential to be applied to ES security evaluation. As expected,
the 77.5 % of them is related exclusively to software, and only the 0.6 % of
them addresses exclusively hardware security. This work aims to lay the
foundations for constructing a security evaluation methodology that uses
metrics to quantify the security level of an ES.

strong/weak coupling duality $b \to 1/b$. Since there is no understanding nor
evidence for such a duality based on the quantum action of the model, it should
be questioned whether the properties of the model for $b>1$ are simply obtained
by analytic continuation of the weak coupling regime $0<b<1$. In this article
we assert that the answer is no, and we develop a concrete and specific
proposal for the properties when $b>1$. Namely, we propose that in this region
one needs to introduce a background charge $Q_\infty = b + 1/b -2$ which
differs from the Liouville background charge by the shift of $-2$. We propose
that in this regime the model has non-trivial massless renormalization group
flows between two different conformal field theories. This is in contrast to
the weak coupling regime which is a theory of a single massive particle.
Evidence for our proposal comes from higher order beta functions. We show how
our proposal correctly reproduces the freezing transitions in the multi-fractal
exponents of a Dirac fermion in $2+1$ dimensions in a random magnetic field,
which provides a strong check since such transitions have several detailed
features. We also point out a connection between a semi-classical version of
this transition and the so-called Manning condensation phenomena in
polyelectrolyte physics.

of deep network models. Recent network pruning methods usually focused on
removing unimportant or redundant filters in the network. In this paper, by
exploring the similarities between feature maps, we propose a novel filter
pruning method, Central Filter (CF), which suggests that a filter is
approximately equal to a set of other filters after appropriate adjustments.
Our method is based on the discovery that the average similarity between
feature maps changes very little, regardless of the number of input images.
Based on this finding, we establish similarity graphs on feature maps and
calculate the closeness centrality of each node to select the Central Filter.
Moreover, we design a method to directly adjust weights in the next layer
corresponding to the Central Filter, effectively minimizing the error caused by
pruning. Through experiments on various benchmark networks and datasets, CF
yields state-of-the-art performance. For example, with ResNet-56, CF reduces
approximately 39.7% of FLOPs by removing 47.1% of the parameters, with even
0.33% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-10. With GoogLeNet, CF reduces

reconstructing the original reward function if the agent uses a tightly private
policy. Using this framework, we empirically test the effectiveness of the
privacy guarantee offered by the private algorithms on multiple instances of
the FrozenLake domain of varying complexities. Based on the analysis performed,
we infer a gap between the current standard of privacy offered and the standard
of privacy needed to protect reward functions in RL. We do so by quantifying
the extent to which each private policy protects the reward function by
measuring distances between the original and reconstructed rewards.

behavioral tasks, Haaf and Rouder (2017) developed a class of hierarchical
Bayesian mixed models with varying levels of constraint on the individual
effects. The models are then compared via Bayes factors, telling us which model
best predicts the observed data. One common criticism of their method is that
the observed data are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. However,
for most cognitive tasks, the primary measure of performance is a response
time, the distribution of which is well known to not be normal. In this paper,
I investigate the assumption of normality for two datasets in numerical
cognition. Specifically, I show that using a shifted lognormal model for the
response times does not change the overall pattern of inference. Further, since
the model-estimated effects are now on a logarithmic scale, the interpretation
of the modeling becomes more difficult, particularly because the estimated
effect is now multiplicative rather than additive. As a result, I recommend
that even though response times are not normally distributed in general, the
simplification afforded by the Haaf and Rouder (2017) approach provides a
pragmatic approach to modeling individual differences in behavioral tasks.

modeling 3D objects and controlled scenes, usually under a single scale. In
this work, we focus on multi-scale cases where large changes in imagery are
observed at drastically different scales. This scenario vastly exists in
real-world 3D environments, such as city scenes, with views ranging from
satellite level that captures the overview of a city, to ground level imagery
showing complex details of an architecture; and can also be commonly identified
in landscape and delicate minecraft 3D models. The wide span of viewing
positions within these scenes yields multi-scale renderings with very different
levels of detail, which poses great challenges to neural radiance field and
biases it towards compromised results. To address these issues, we introduce
BungeeNeRF, a progressive neural radiance field that achieves level-of-detail
rendering across drastically varied scales. Starting from fitting distant views
with a shallow base block, as training progresses, new blocks are appended to
accommodate the emerging details in the increasingly closer views. The strategy
progressively activates high-frequency channels in NeRF's positional encoding
inputs and successively unfolds more complex details as the training proceeds.
We demonstrate the superiority of BungeeNeRF in modeling diverse multi-scale
scenes with drastically varying views on multiple data sources (city models,
synthetic, and drone captured data) and its support for high-quality rendering
in different levels of detail.

Least Squares Deconvolution Network (RLSDN) architecture, which consists of an
implicit layer that imposes a linear constraint between its input and output.
By design, our network manages to serve two important purposes simultaneously.
The first is that it implicitly models an effective image prior that can
adequately characterize the set of natural images, while the second is that it
recovers the corresponding maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. Experiments on
publicly available datasets, comparing recent state-of-the-art methods, show
that our proposed RLSDN approach achieves the best reported performance both

introduce a novel training strategy that can be adopted by any network
architecture that involves the solution of linear systems as part of its
pipeline. Our strategy eliminates completely the need to unroll the iterations
required by the linear solver and, thus, it reduces significantly the memory
footprint during training. Consequently, this enables the training of deeper

Grism 141 (WFC3/G141) data. First we extracted and corrected the raw data to
obtain a transmission spectrum in the near-infrared (NIR) band (1.1-1.7$\mu$m).
We corrected for stellar modulations using three different stellar
contamination models; while some fit the data better, they are statistically
not significant and the conclusion remains unchanged concerning the presence or
lack thereof of an atmosphere. Finally, using a Bayesian atmospheric retrieval
code, we put new constraints on the atmosphere composition of TRAPPIST-1h.
According to the retrieval analysis, there is no evidence of molecular
absorption in the NIR spectrum. This suggests the presence of a high cloud deck
or a layer of photochemical hazes in either a primary atmosphere or a secondary
atmosphere dominated by heavy species such as nitrogen. This result could even
be the consequence of the lack of an atmosphere as the spectrum is better
fitted using a flat line. We cannot yet distinguish between a primary cloudy or
a secondary clear envelope using HST/WFC3 data; however, in most cases with
more than 3$\sigma$ confidence, we can reject the hypothesis of a clear
atmosphere dominated by hydrogen and helium. By testing the forced secondary
atmospheric scenario, we find that a CO-rich atmosphere (i.e. with a volume
mixing ratio of 0.2) is one of the best fits to the spectrum with a Bayes

predictions. We here connect the two worlds by showing that classical
interference can be quantum-mechanically interpreted as a bosonic form of
super- and subradiance, giving rise to bright and dark states for light modes.
We revisit the double-slit experiment and the Mach-Zehnder interferometer,

in describing the light-matter quantum dynamics when several vacuum modes are
involved. In light of our approach, the unambiguous criterion for the coupling
to occur is the presence of non-dark states when decomposing the collective
state of light. We discuss how the results here discussed could be verified in
trapped ion systems or in cross-cavity setups. Finally, we show how the bosonic

the backbone of separation logic, the much studied logic for reasoning about
heap-manipulating programs. Although the proof theory and metatheory of BI are
mathematically involved, the formalization of important metatheoretical results
is still incipient. In this paper we present a self-contained formalized, in
the Coq proof assistant, proof of a central metatheoretical property of BI: cut
elimination for its sequent calculus.
  The presented proof is *semantic*, in the sense that is obtained by
interpreting sequents in a particular ""universal"" model. This results in a more
modular and elegant proof than a standard Gentzen-style cut elimination
argument, which can be subtle and error-prone in manual proofs for BI. In
particular, our semantic approach avoids unnecessary inversions on proof
derivations, or the uses of cut reductions and the multi-cut rule.
  Besides modular, our approach is also robust: we demonstrate how our method
scales, with minor modifications, to (i) an extension of BI with an arbitrary
set of \emph{simple structural rules}, and (ii) an extension with an S4-like
$\Box$ modality.

properties are determined by three length scales, the correlation length $\xi$,
the average distance between germs $d_g$, and the spatial scale probed by
scattering, set by the inverse of the scattering wavevector $Q$. At small
scales, we find that the fractal structure of individual clusters is retained,
the structure factor decaying as $Q^{-d_f}$. At large scales, the structure
factor tends to a limit, set by the smaller of $\xi$ and $d_g$, both below and
above $p_c$. We propose approximate expressions reproducing the simulated
structure factor for arbitrary $\xi$, $d_g$, and $Q$, and illustrate how they
can be used to avoid to resort to costly numerical simulations. For invasion
from surfaces, we find that, at $p_c$, the structure factor behaves as
$Q^{-d_f}$ at all $Q$, i.e. the fractal structure is retained at arbitrarily

connection between structural properties and the transport coefficients,
verifying the validity of the excess entropy scaling relations for all the

On this line, they indicate the importance of describing the long-range

thought to mainly arise from gas with densities $\mathrm{\sim 10^4\ -\ 10^5\

However, there is increasing evidence from observational surveys of `resolved'
molecular clouds that HCN can trace more diffuse gas. We investigate the
relationship between gas density and HCN emission through post-processing of
high resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations of cloud-cloud collisions. We
find that HCN emission traces gas with a mean volumetric density of
$\mathrm{\sim 3 \times 10^3\ cm^{-3}}$ and a median visual extinction of
$\mathrm{\sim 5\ mag}$. We therefore predict a characteristic density that is
an order of magnitude less than the ""standard"" characteristic density of
$\mathrm{n \sim 3 \times 10^4\ cm^{-3}}$. Indeed, we find in some cases that
there is clear HCN emission from the cloud even though there is no gas denser
than this standard critical density. We derive luminosity-to-mass conversion
factors for the amount of gas at $A_{\rm V} > 8$ or at densities $n > 2.85

the subsurface static properties and the dynamics of fluid flow and heat
transfer. Uncertainty quantification using simulations is a useful tool to
design optimum field-development and to guide decision-making. The optimization
process includes assessments of multiple time-dependent flow mechanisms, which
are functions of operational parameters subject to subsurface uncertainties.
This process requires careful determination of the parameter ranges,
dependencies, and their probabilistic distribution functions. This study
presents a new approach to assess time-dependent predictions of thermal
recovery and produced-enthalpy rates, including uncertainty quantification and
optimization. We use time-continuous and multi-objective uncertainty
quantification for geothermal recovery, undergoing a water re-injection scheme.
The ranges of operational and uncertainty parameters are determined from a
collected database, including 135 geothermal fields worldwide. The uncertainty
calculation is conducted non-intrusively, based on a workflow that couples
low-fidelity models with Monte Carlo analysis. Full-physics reservoir
simulations are used to construct and verify the low-fidelity models. The
sampling process is performed with Design of Experiments, enhanced with
space-filling, and combined with analysis of covariance to capture parameter
dependencies. The predicted thermal recovery and produced-enthalpy rates are
then evaluated as functions of the significant uncertainty parameters based on
dimensionless groups. The workflow is applied for various geothermal fields to
assess their optimum well-spacing in their well configuration. This approach
offers an efficient and robust workflow for time-continuous uncertainty
quantification and global sensitivity analysis applied for geothermal field
modeling and optimization.

to the cat qubit manifold, two main approaches have been considered so far: a
Kerr-based Hamiltonian confinement with high gate performances, and a
dissipative confinement with robust protection against a broad range of noise
mechanisms. We introduce a new combined dissipative and Hamiltonian confinement
scheme based on two-photon dissipation together with a Two-Photon Exchange
(TPE) Hamiltonian. The TPE Hamiltonian is similar to Kerr nonlinearity, but
unlike the Kerr it only induces a bounded distinction between even- and
odd-photon eigenstates, a highly beneficial feature for protecting the cat
qubits with dissipative mechanisms. Using this combined confinement scheme, we
demonstrate fast and bias-preserving gates with drastically improved
performance compared to dissipative or Hamiltonian schemes. In addition, this
combined scheme can be implemented experimentally with only minor modifications

of occupancy-based path planners related to their dependency on accurate and
dense maps. More specifically, their performance is highly affected by poorly
reconstructed or sparse areas (e.g. holes in the walls or ceilings) leading to
faulty generated paths outside the physical boundaries of the 3-dimensional
space. As it will be presented, D$^*_+$ addresses this challenge with three
novel contributions, integrated into one solution, namely: a) the proximity
risk, b) the modeling of the unknown space, and c) the map updates. By adding a
risk layer to spaces that are closer to the occupied ones, some holes are
filled, and thus the problematic short-cutting through them to the final goal
is prevented. The novel established D$^*_+$ also provides safety marginals to
the walls and other obstacles, a property that results in paths that do not cut
the corners that could potentially disrupt the platform operation. D$^*_+$ has
also the capability to model the unknown space as risk-free areas that should
keep the paths inside, e.g in a tunnel environment, and thus heavily reducing
the risk of larger shortcuts through openings in the walls. D$^*_+$ is also
introducing a dynamic map handling capability that continuously updates with
the latest information acquired during the map building process, allowing the
planner to use constant map growth and resolve cases of planning over outdated
sparser map reconstructions...

connected to the thigh via rods. The LOPER allows to apply force perturbations
to a free-hanging leg, while standing on the contralateral leg, with a
bandwidth of up to 39 Hz. While walking in minimal impedance mode, the
interaction forces between LOPER and the thigh were low (<5 N) and the effect
on the walking pattern was smaller than the within-subject variability during
normal walking. Using a non-linear multibody dynamical model of swing leg
dynamics, the hip, knee and ankle joint impedance were estimated at three time
points during the swing phase for nine subjects walking at a speed of 0.5 m/s.
The identified model was well able to predict the experimental responses for
the hip and knee, since the mean variance accounted (VAF) for was 99% and 96%,
respectively. The ankle lacked a consistent response and the mean VAF of the
model fit was only 77%, and therefore the estimated ankle impedance was not

The damping varied between 1.9-4.6 and 0.02-0.14 Nms/rad for hip and knee

  back-ends",,"10.1016/j.jss.2023.111669",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As neural networks are increasingly included as core components of
safety-critical systems, developing effective testing techniques specialized
for them becomes crucial. The bulk of the research has focused on testing
neural-network models; but these models are defined by writing programs, and
there is growing evidence that these neural-network programs often have bugs
too.
  This paper presents aNNoTest: an approach to generating test inputs for
neural-network programs. A fundamental challenge is that the dynamically-typed
languages (e.g., Python) commonly used to program neural networks cannot
express detailed constraints about valid function inputs (e.g., matrices with
certain dimensions). Without knowing these constraints, automated test-case
generation is prone to producing invalid inputs, which trigger spurious
failures and are useless for identifying real bugs. To address this problem, we
introduce a simple annotation language tailored for concisely expressing valid
function inputs in neural-network programs. aNNoTest takes as input an
annotated program, and uses property-based testing to generate random inputs
that satisfy the validity constraints. In the paper, we also outline guidelines
that simplify writing aNNoTest annotations.
  We evaluated aNNoTest on 19 neural-network programs from Islam et al's
survey., which we manually annotated following our guidelines -- producing 6
annotations per tested function on average. aNNoTest automatically generated
test inputs that revealed 94 bugs, including 63 bugs that the survey reported
for these projects. These results suggest that aNNoTest can be a valuable
approach to finding widespread bugs in real-world neural-network programs.

because different weed control strategies have different trade-offs regarding
the required resources and treatment efficiency. So, the question arises
whether a wide tractor-based system with section control or a small
agricultural robot has a higher weed control performance for a given
infestation scenario. For example, a small autonomous robot moving from one
weed to the next might have much shorter travel distances (and thus lower
energy and time costs) than a tractor-mounted system if the locations of the
weeds are relatively isolated across the field. However, if the plants are
highly concentrated in small areas so-called clusters, the increased width of
the tractor-mounted implement could be beneficial because of shorter travel
distances and greater working width.
  An additional challenge is the fact that there is no complete knowledge of
the weed locations. Weeds may not have been detected, for example, due to their
growth stage, occlusion by other objects, or misclassification. Weed control
strategies must therefore also be evaluated with regard to this issue. Thus, in
addition to the driving distance, other metrics are also of interest, such as
the number of plants that were actually controlled or the size of the total
treatment area.
  We performed this investigation for the treatment of the toxic Colchicum
autumnale, which had been detected in drone images of extensive grassland
sites. In addition to real data, we generated and analyzed simulated weed
locations using mathematical models of stochastic geometry. These offer the
possibility to simulate very different spatial distributions of toxic plant
locations. Different treatment strategies were then virtually tested on this
data using Monte Carlo simulations and their performance was statistically
evaluated.

ferroelectricity have attracted substantial attentions. In this work, the
structural, electronic and optical properties of 2D ferroelectric Ga2O3 bilayer
system are systematically studied using ab-initio computational method.
Intrinsic dipoles of the two freestanding monolayers lead to three distinct
dipole models (one ferroelectric and two antiferroelectric models). The stable
stacking configurations of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric dipole models
can be transferred with polarization reversal transition of the monolayers
without additional operation. Interlayer perturbation effects combined with
biaxial-strain engineering lead to high tunablility of the electronic and
optical properties of the bilayer systems. Surprisingly, the results reveal a
phase transition from vdW to ionic interlayer interaction induced by in-plane
biaxial tensile strain. Detailed analyses suggest a transition mechanism based
on the ionic bonding nature of the Ga2O3 system, involving interlayer
rearrangement of anions to compensate the symmetry breaking of the heavily
distorted ionic folding configurations. These insights can open new prospects
for future experimental synthesis, characterization and application of 2D Ga2O3
atomic-thin layered systems.

  Triangulations: Results in 2D That Outperform Roped KD-Trees (And Massively

structures for computing ray-object intersections. Less known is the
Constrained Convex Space Partitioning (CCSP), which partitions space and makes
the geometric primitives exactly overlap with the boundaries of its cells.
Consequently, it is robust against ill-fitting cells that plague methods with
axis-aligned cells (kd-tree, BVH) and it permits an efficient, stackless
traversal.
  Within computer graphics, CCSPs have received some attention in both 2D and
3D, but their construction methods were never directly aimed at minimizing
their traversal cost -- even having fundamentally opposing goals for
Delaunay-type methods. Instead, for an isotropic and translation-invariant ray
distribution the traversal cost is minimized by minimizing the weight: the
total boundary size of all cells in the structure.
  We study the 2D case using triangulations as CCSPs and minimize their total
edge length using a simulated annealing process that allows for topological
changes and varying vertex count. Standard Delaunay-based triangulation
techniques show total edge lengths ranging from 10% higher to twice as high as
our optimized triangulations for a variety of scenes, with a similar difference
in traversal cost when using the triangulations for ray tracing. Compared to a
roped kd-tree, our triangulations require less traversal steps for all scenes
that we tested and they are robust against the kd-tree's pathological behaviour
when geometry becomes misaligned with the world axes. Moreover, the stackless
traversal strongly outperforms a BVH, which always requires a top-down descent
in the hierarchy. In fact, we show several scenes where the number of traversal
operations for our triangulations decreases(!) as the number of geometric
primitives $N$ increases, in contrast to the increasing $\log N$ behaviour of a
BVH.

nucleation fraction ($f_{nuc}$), the galaxy's nuclear star cluster (NSC) mass
and the mass in its surviving globular clusters ($M_{GC,obs}$). Considering the
mass and orbital evolution of a GC in a galaxy potential, we define a critical
mass limit ($M_{GC,lim}$) above which a GC can simultaneously in-spiral to the
galaxy centre due to dynamical friction and survive tidal dissolution, to build
up the NSC. The analytic expression for this threshold mass allows us to model
the nucleation fraction for populations of galaxies. We find that the slope and
curvature of the initial galaxy size-mass relation is the most important factor
(with the shape of the GC mass function a secondary effect) setting the
fraction of galaxies that are nucleated at a given mass. The well defined
skew-normal $f_{nuc} - M_{gal}$ observations in galaxy cluster populations are
naturally reproduced in these models, provided there is an inflection in the
{initial} size-mass relation at $M_{gal} \sim 10^{9.5} {\rm M_{\odot}}$. Our
analytic model also predicts limits to the $M_{gal} - M_{GC,tot}$ and $M_{gal}
- M_{NSC}$ relations which bound the scatter of the observational data.
Moreoever, we illustrate how these scaling relations and $f_{nuc}$ vary if the
star cluster formation efficiency, GC mass function, galaxy environment or
galaxy size-mass relation are altered. Two key predictions of our model are: 1)
galaxies with NSC masses greater than their GC system masses are more compact
at fixed stellar mass, and 2) the fraction of nucleated galaxies at fixed
galaxy mass is higher in denser environments. That a single model framework can
reproduce both the NSC and GC scaling relations provides strong evidence that
GC in-spiral is an important mechanism for NSC formation.

(cognitive processes for strategy selection and decision-making). We present
such a conceptual computational architecture based on principles of predictive
processing and free energy minimization. Using this general model, we describe
how a sense of control can form across the levels of a control hierarchy and
how this can support action control in an unpredictable environment. We present
an implementation of this model as well as first evaluations in a simulated
task scenario, in which an autonomous agent has to cope with un-/predictable
situations and experiences corresponding sense of control. We explore different
model parameter settings that lead to different ways of combining low-level and

tasks and use BERT-like objectives (masked language modeling and image-text

downstream tasks, e.g., visual question answering, image-text retrieval and
visual entailment, they do not possess the ability to generate. To tackle this
problem, we propose Unified multimodal pre-training for both Vision-Language
understanding and generation (UniVL). The proposed UniVL is capable of handling
both understanding tasks and generative tasks. We augment existing pretraining
paradigms that only use random masks with causal masks, i.e., triangular masks
that mask out future tokens, such that the pre-trained models can have
autoregressive generation abilities by design. We formulate several previous
understanding tasks as a text generation task and propose to use prompt-based
method for fine-tuning on different downstream tasks. Our experiments show that
there is a trade-off between understanding tasks and generation tasks while
using the same model, and a feasible way to improve both tasks is to use more
data. Our UniVL framework attains comparable performance to recent
vision-language pre-training methods on both understanding tasks and generation
tasks. Moreover, we demostrate that prompt-based finetuning is more
data-efficient - it outperforms discriminative methods in few-shot scenarios.

ones, can be very costly to train, demanding a great amount of data and
computational resources. Unauthorized reproduction of DL models can lead to
copyright infringement and cause huge economic losses to model owners. Existing
copyright protection techniques are mostly based on watermarking, which embeds
an owner-specified watermark into the model. While being able to provide exact
ownership verification, these techniques are 1) invasive, as they need to
tamper with the training process, which may affect the utility or introduce new
security risks; 2) prone to adaptive attacks that attempt to remove the
watermark; and 3) not robust to the emerging model extraction attacks. Latest
fingerprinting work, though being non-invasive, also falls short when facing
the diverse and ever-growing attack scenarios. In this paper, we propose a
novel testing framework for DL copyright protection: DEEPJUDGE. DEEPJUDGE
quantitatively tests the similarities between two DL models: a victim model and
a suspect model. It leverages a diverse set of testing metrics and test case
generation methods to produce a chain of supporting evidence to help determine
whether a suspect model is a copy of the victim model. Advantages of DEEPJUDGE
include: 1) non-invasive, as it works directly on the model and does not tamper
with the training process; 2) efficient, as it only needs a small set of test
cases and a quick scan of models; 3) flexible, as it can easily incorporate new
metrics or generation methods to obtain more confident judgement; and 4) fairly
robust to model extraction and adaptive attacks. We verify the effectiveness of
DEEPJUDGE under typical copyright infringement scenarios, including model
finetuning, pruning and extraction, via extensive experiments on both image and
speech datasets with a variety of model architectures.

is of fundamental importance to machine learning. Bayesian inference on
Gaussian processes has proven to be a viable approach for studying recurrent
and deep networks in the limit of infinite layer width, $n\to\infty$. Here we
present a unified and systematic derivation of the mean-field theory for both
architectures that starts from first principles by employing established
methods from statistical physics of disordered systems. The theory elucidates
that while the mean-field equations are different with regard to their temporal
structure, they yet yield identical Gaussian kernels when readouts are taken at
a single time point or layer, respectively. Bayesian inference applied to
classification then predicts identical performance and capabilities for the two
architectures. Numerically, we find that convergence towards the mean-field
theory is typically slower for recurrent networks than for deep networks and
the convergence speed depends non-trivially on the parameters of the weight
prior as well as the depth or number of time steps, respectively. Our method
exposes that Gaussian processes are but the lowest order of a systematic
expansion in $1/n$ and we compute next-to-leading-order corrections which turn
out to be architecture-specific. The formalism thus paves the way to
investigate the fundamental differences between recurrent and deep

of molecular species involved in the accompanying phototransformations. TA
spectra show that upon photoexcitation two SOAP tautomers (E-enol and Z-keto)
interconvert by ESIPT. The molecule can subsequently isomerize to the E-keto
form of SOAP. An intriguing observation is that the TA spectra of this compound
in ethanol show modulations of the signal at the stimulated emission spectral
range. It is found that these modulations are due to the coherence of the
excited ensemble of molecules whose evolution over time represents a moving
wave packet. After Fourier transform of the modulations, two characteristic
frequencies are identified. These frequencies are referred to the corresponding
vibrational modes of the excited state and their nature is elucidated by DFT
quantum chemical calculations. The obtained experimental and theoretical data
reveal the nature of vibronic coupling between the ground and excited state and
the type of molecular vibrations involved in the molecular dynamics along the

excitation. These vibrations characterize the starting point in the excited

decoding that received considerable attention over the years. However, the
optimal trade-off among list-decoding (resp. list-recovery) radius, list size,
and the code rate are not fully understood in both problems. This paper takes a
step towards this direction when the list size is a given constant and the
alphabet size is large (as a function of the code length). We prove a new
Singleton-type upper bound for list-decodable codes, which improves upon the
previously known bound by roughly a factor of $1/L$, where $L$ is the list
size. We also prove a Singleton-type upper bound for list-recoverable codes,
which is to the best of our knowledge, the first such bound for list-recovery.
We apply these results to obtain new lower bounds that are optimal up to a
multiplicative constant on the list size for list-decodable and
list-recoverable codes with rates approaching capacity.
  Moreover, we show that list-decodable \emph{nonlinear} codes can strictly
outperform list-decodable linear codes. More precisely, we show that there is a
gap for a wide range of parameters, which grows fast with the alphabet size,
between the size of the largest list-decodable nonlinear code and the size of
the largest list-decodable linear codes. This is achieved by a novel connection
between list-decoding and the notion of sparse hypergraphs in extremal
combinatorics. We remark that such a gap is not known to exist in the problem

  Lastly, we show that list-decodability or recoverability of codes implies in

interactions. In this work we formalize and generalize the definition of
evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) to be able to include a scenario in which
the game is played by two players with probability $p$, and by three players
with the complementary probability $1-p$. We show the existence of equilibria
in pure and mixed strategies depending on the probability $p$, on a concrete

high-order interactions is to look at how it evolves in complex networks. We
introduce and study an agent-based model on a network with a fixed number of

\epsilon^{-2})$ and $O(\kappa^{4} \epsilon^{-4})$ iterations, while (ii)
smoothed GDA and its stochastic variant (without mini batch) respectively
require $O(\kappa \epsilon^{-2})$ and $O(\kappa^{2} \epsilon^{-4})$ iterations.
The latter greatly improves over the vanilla GDA and gives the hitherto best
known complexity results among single-loop algorithms under similar settings.
We further showcase the empirical efficiency of these algorithms in training
GANs and robust nonlinear regression.

exciton-polariton condensates from the incoherent high-energy excitonic
reservoir located at the pumping laser position. This technique has
significantly improved the coherent properties of exciton-polariton
condensates, when compared to a quasi-homogeneous spot excitation scheme. Here,
we compare two experimental methods on a sample, where a single spot excitation
experiment allowed only to observe photonic lasing in the weak coupling regime.
In contrast, the ring-shaped excitation resulted in the two-threshold behavior,
where an exciton-polariton condensate manifests itself at the first and photon
lasing at the second threshold. Both lasing regimes are trapped in an optical
potential created by the pump. We interpret the origin of this confining
potential in terms of repulsive interactions of polaritons with the reservoir
at the first threshold and as a result of the excessive free-carrier induced
refractive index change of the microcavity at the second threshold. This
observation offers a way to achieve multiple phases of photonic condensates in
samples, e.g., containing novel materials as an active layer, where
two-threshold behavior is impossible to achieve with a single excitation spot.

elimination of redundant logic found on prior attempts. In combination with the
distributed nature of the selector stage, a higher performance is achieved for
the same amount of parallelism or higher. This is useful in many applications
such as in parallel merge trees to achieve high-throughput sorting, where the
resource utilisation of the merger is critical for building large trees and
internalising the workload for fast computation. Also presented are efficient
variations of FLiMS for optimizing throughput for skewed datasets, achieving

infinitesimal generator of $\mathfrak{G}$, we now define a charge and a flux on
NEHs as well as perturbed NEHs. The procedure uses the covariant phase space
framework in presence of internal null boundaries $\mathcal{N}$. However,
$\mathcal{N}$ is required to be an NEH or a perturbed NEH. Consequently,
charges and fluxes associated with generators of $\mathfrak{G}$ are free of
physically unsatisfactory features that can arise if $\mathcal{N}$ is allowed
to be a general null boundary. In particular, all fluxes vanish if
$\mathcal{N}$ is an NEH, just as one would hope; and fluxes associated with
symmetries representing `time-translations' are positive definite on perturbed
NEHs. These results hold for zero as well as non-zero cosmological constant. In
the asymptotically flat case, as noted in \cite{akkl1}, $\mathcal{I}^\pm$ are
NEHs in the conformally completed space-time but with an extra structure that
reduces $\mathfrak{G}$ to $\mathfrak{B}$. The flux expressions at $\mathcal{N}$
reflect this synergy between NEHs and $\mathcal{I}^{+}$. In a forthcoming

develop gravitational wave tomography, enabling one to deduce horizon dynamics

investigate these relationships because measures are model-free and thus also

in particular able to account for interactions between parameters, which are

relevant optimization parameters using a recently introduced
information-theoretic feature-selection algorithm that accounts for
interactions between parameters. Second, we use the novel partial information
decomposition (PID) framework that allows to quantify redundant and synergistic
contributions between selected parameters with respect to the optimization
outcome to identify parameter interactions. We thus demonstrate the power of
novel information-theoretic approaches in identifying relevant parameters in
optimization runs and highlight how these methods avoid the selection of
redundant parameters, while detecting interactions that result in synergistic
contributions of multiple parameters.

the centres of galaxies, from the dwarf regime to massive ellipticals and
spirals. The fraction of nucleated galaxies is as high as $>$ 90 % at
$M_{\text{gal}} \sim 10^9 M_\odot$. However, how NSC formation mechanisms work
in different regimes and what determines galaxy nucleation is still unclear.
The dissipationless accretion of infalling globular clusters (GCs) and the in
situ formation of stars directly at the galactic centre likely operate to grow
NSCs in most galaxies; however, their efficiency has been difficult to assess
observationally. Here, we provide, for the first time, a quantitative
determination of the relative strength of these processes in the build-up of
individual NSCs. Using a semi-analytical model of NSC formation based on the
orbital evolution of inspiraling GCs, together with observed NSC and GC system
properties, we derived the mass fraction of in situ born stars $f_\text{in,
NSC}$ for 119 galaxies with masses from $3 \times 10^{7}$ to $3 \times 10^{11}
M_\odot$, in the Local Volume, the Fornax, and Virgo galaxy clusters. Our
analysis reveals that the NSC mass, as well as the ratio of NSC to the total GC
system mass, are strong indicators of the dominant NSC formation channel, and
not the total galaxy stellar mass as previously suggested. More massive NSCs
formed predominantly via the in situ formation of stars ($f_\text{in, NSC} \sim
0.9$), while the lower-mass NSCs are expected to have formed predominantly
through the merger of GCs ($f_\text{in, NSC} \sim 0.2$). The results of this
simple model are in agreement with recent independent estimates of the dominant
NSC formation channel from recent stellar population analysis.

networks is one of the most important open questions in deep learning. However,
due to the highly complex nature of the problem, progress has been relatively
slow. In this note, through the lens of infinite-width networks, a.k.a. neural
kernels, we present one such principle resulting from hierarchical localities.
It is well-known that the eigenstructure of infinite-width multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) depends solely on the concept frequency, which measures the
order of interactions. We show that the topologies from deep convolutional
networks (CNNs) restructure the associated eigenspaces into finer subspaces. In
addition to frequency, the new structure also depends on the concept space,
which measures the spatial distance among nonlinear interaction terms. The
resulting fine-grained eigenstructure dramatically improves the network's
learnability, empowering them to simultaneously model a much richer class of
interactions, including Long-Range-Low-Frequency interactions,
Short-Range-High-Frequency interactions, and various interpolations and
extrapolations in-between. Additionally, model scaling can improve the
resolutions of interpolations and extrapolations and, therefore, the network's
learnability. Finally, we prove a sharp characterization of the generalization
error for infinite-width CNNs of any depth in the high-dimensional setting. Two
corollaries follow: (1) infinite-width deep CNNs can break the curse of
dimensionality without losing their expressivity, and (2) scaling improves
performance in both the finite and infinite data regimes.

overview. To the best of our knowledge, no current systematic review of

an overview of existing ITS that use external infrastructure worldwide.
Accordingly, this paper addresses current questions and challenges. For this
purpose, we performed a literature review of documents that describe existing
ITS solutions from 2009 until today. We categorized the results according to
technology levels and analyzed its hardware system setup and value-added
contributions. In doing so, we made the ITS solutions comparable and
highlighted past development alongside current trends. We analyzed more than
357 papers, including 52 test bed projects. In summary, current ITSs can
deliver accurate information about individuals in traffic situations in
real-time. However, further research into ITS should focus on more reliable
perception of the traffic using modern sensors, plug-and-play mechanisms, and
secure real-time distribution of the digital twins in a decentralized manner.
By addressing these topics, the development of intelligent transportation
systems will be able to take a step towards its comprehensive roll-out.

magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction by enabling multiple institutions
to collaborate without needing to aggregate local data. However, the domain
shift caused by different MR imaging protocols can substantially degrade the
performance of FL models. Recent FL techniques tend to solve this by enhancing
the generalization of the global model, but they ignore the domain-specific
features, which may contain important information about the device properties
and be useful for local reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a
specificity-preserving FL algorithm for MR image reconstruction (FedMRI). The
core idea is to divide the MR reconstruction model into two parts: a globally
shared encoder to obtain a generalized representation at the global level, and
a client-specific decoder to preserve the domain-specific properties of each
client, which is important for collaborative reconstruction when the clients
have unique distribution. Such scheme is then executed in the frequency space
and the image space respectively, allowing exploration of generalized

important tools for diagnosis, triage, prognosis, and treatment planning.
However, MRI suffers from an inherent slow data acquisition process because
data is collected sequentially in k-space. In recent years, most MRI
reconstruction methods proposed in the literature focus on holistic image
reconstruction rather than enhancing the edge information. This work steps
aside this general trend by elaborating on the enhancement of edge information.
Specifically, we introduce a novel parallel imaging coupled dual discriminator
generative adversarial network (PIDD-GAN) for fast multi-channel MRI
reconstruction by incorporating multi-view information. The dual discriminator
design aims to improve the edge information in MRI reconstruction. One
discriminator is used for holistic image reconstruction, whereas the other one
is responsible for enhancing edge information. An improved U-Net with local and
global residual learning is proposed for the generator. Frequency channel
attention blocks (FCA Blocks) are embedded in the generator for incorporating
attention mechanisms. Content loss is introduced to train the generator for
better reconstruction quality. We performed comprehensive experiments on
Calgary-Campinas public brain MR dataset and compared our method with
state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods. Ablation studies of residual
learning were conducted on the MICCAI13 dataset to validate the proposed
modules. Results show that our PIDD-GAN provides high-quality reconstructed MR
images, with well-preserved edge information. The time of single-image
reconstruction is below 5ms, which meets the demand of faster processing.

affect significantly the effective material properties and result in
uncertainties in the mechanical response. Numerical analysis of the effects of
the imperfections and the uncertainty quantification (UQ) can be often done by
use of digital stochastic surrogate material models. In this work, we present a
new flexible class of surrogate models depending on a small number of

constructed as the level-set of a linear combination of an intensity field
representing the topological shape and a Gaussian perturbation representing the

physical ones and thus easy to interpret. The calibration of the model
parameters is performed using progressive batching sub-sampled quasi-Newton
minimization, using a designed distance measure between the synthetic samples
and the data. Then, employing a fast sampling algorithm, an arbitrary number of
synthetic samples can be generated to use in Monte Carlo type methods. In
particular, we illustrate the method in application to UQ of the elasto-plastic
response of an imperfect octet-truss lattice which plays an important role in
additive manufacturing. To this end, we study the effective material properties
of the lattice unit cell under elasto-plastic deformations and investigate the

simple random resizing and padding. For model augmentation, we randomly alter
the back propagation instead of the forward propagation to eliminate the effect

modified model as a task, we expect the adversarial perturbations to adopt

further introduced during the iteration of perturbation generation. Empirical

robotic instrument segmentation challenge. Compared to the state-of-the-art
segmentation and saliency methods, our model outperforms most of the evaluation
metrics and produces an outstanding performance in the challenge.

  (2020)","10.2140/involve.2020.13.577",,"math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An equidistant polytope is a special equidistant set in the space
$\mathbb{R}^n$ all of whose boundary points have equal distances from two
finite systems of points. Since one of the finite systems of the given points
is required to be in the interior of the convex hull of the other one we can
speak about inner and outer focal points of the equidistant polytope. It is of
type $(q, p)$, where $q$ is the number of the outer focal points and $p$ is the
number of the inner focal points. The equidistancy is the generalization of
convexity because a convex polytope can be given as an equidistant polytope of
type $(q, 1)$, where $q\geq n+1$. In the paper we present some general results
about the basic properties of the equidistant polytopes: convex components,
graph representations, connectedness, correspondence to the Voronoi
decomposition of the space etc. Especially, we are interested in equidistant
polytopes of dimension $2$ (equidistant polygons). Equidistant polygons of type
$(3,2)$ will be characterized in terms of a constructive (ruler-and-compass)
process to recognize them. In general they are pentagons with exactly two
concave angles such that the vertices, where the concave angles appear at, are
joined by an inner diagonal related to the adjacent sides of the polygon in a
special way via the three reflection theorem for concurrent lines. The last
section is devoted to some special arrangements of the focal points to get the
concave quadrangles as equidistant polygons of type $(3,2)$.

intelligent surface (RIS) assisted wireless networks under Rician fading are
investigated in this paper. More precisely, we enhance the secrecy performance
of the considered networks by suppressing the wiretap channel instead of
maximizing the main channel. We propose a simple heuristic algorithm to find
out the optimal phase-shift of each RIS's element. Simulation results based on
the Monte-Carlo method are given to verify the superiority of the proposed
optimal phase-shifts compared to the random phase-shifts design.

address this shortage, transition programmes are being created that help people
change to careers in IT. To provide useful programmes, we need to know if the
current curriculum provides value to its graduates. Moreover, as the IT
industry undergoes continuous change, we need to regularly review what the
industry needs and update any existing programmes as appropriate. In this paper
we present the results of a survey of graduates of one such programme, the
PGCertInfoTech at University of Auckland, with the view to evaluating the
currency of the existing programme and to gather data on which to base
decisions on updating it. Our conclusion is that our programme is largely
useful to graduates, but could be improved with the addition of material on
continuous integration, and some adjustment to the time spent on testing,
concurrency, and project management. Our results will be useful to any other
institutions having, or considering to have, IT transition programmes.

a high phase resolution, capable of beam-steering in the azimuthal plane at
sub-6 Gigahertz (GHz). Field trials in realistic indoor deployments have been
carried out, with coverage enhancement performance ascertained for three common
wireless communication scenarios. Namely, serving users in an open lobby with
mixed line of sight and non-line of sight conditions, communication via a
junction between long corridors, and a multi-floor scenario with propagation
via windows. This work explores the potential for reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS) deployment to mitigate non-line of sight effects in indoor
wireless communications. In a single transmitter, single receiver non-line of
sight link, received power improvement of as much as 40 dB is shown to be
achievable by suitable placement of a RIS, with an instantaneous bandwidth of
at least 100 MHz possible over a 3 to 4.5 GHz range. In addition, the effects
of phase resolution on the optimal power reception for the multi-bit RIS have
been experimentally verified, with a 2.65 dB improvement compared to a 1-bit
case.

it can be measured. For example, when a pollutant enters a river, it
immediately begins dispersing, flowing, settling, and reacting. If the
pollutant enters at a single point, its concentration can be measured before it
enters the complex dynamics of the river system. However, in the case of a
non-point source pollutant, it is not clear how to efficiently measure its
source. One possibility is to record concentration measurements in the river,
but this signal is masked by the fluid dynamics of the river. Specifically,
concentration is governed by the advection-diffusion-reaction PDE, with an
unknown source term. We propose a method to statistically reconstruct a source
term from these PDE-deformed measurements. Our method is general and applies to
any linear PDE. This method has important applications in the study of
environmental DNA and non-point source pollution.

Jekyll RDF we present a method to close the gap between structured data and
human accessible exploration interfaces by publishing RDF datasets as
customizable static HTML sites. It consists of an RDF resource mapping system
to serve the resources under their respective IRI, a template mapping based on
schema classes, and a markup language to define templates to render customized
resource pages. Using the template system, it is possible to create domain
specific browsing interfaces for RDF data next to the Linked Data resources.
This enables content management and knowledge management systems to serve

which are tropical polynomials locally but may have infinite number of
monomials. Tropical series appeared in the study of the growth of pluriharmonic
functions. However our motivation originated in sandpile models where certain
wave dynamic governs the behaviour of sand and exhibits a power law (so far
only experimental evidence). In this paper we lay background for tropical
series and corresponding tropical analytical hypersurfaces in the
multidimensional setting. The main object of study is $\Omega$-tropical series
where $\Omega$ is a compact convex domain which can be thought of the region of
convergence of such a series.
  Our main theorem is that the sandpile dynamic producing an $\Omega$-tropical
analytical hypersurface passing through a given finite number of points can
always be slightly perturbed such that the intermediate $\Omega$-tropical
analytical hypersurfaces have only mild singularities.
