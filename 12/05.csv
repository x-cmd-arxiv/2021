impossible. Under mild hypotheses on $w$ and $t$, we derive upper and lower
bounds on the fidelity of state transfer between end vertices at readout time
$t$. Using those bounds, we localise the readout times for which that fidelity
is close to $1$. We also provide expressions for, and bounds on, the

geometrically distorted and blurry. To mitigate the turbulence effect, in this
paper, we propose the first turbulence mitigation method that makes use of
visual priors encapsulated by a well-trained GAN. Based on the visual priors,
we propose to learn to preserve the identity of restored images on a spatial

images from the GAN while considering the identity difference at the network
learning. In addition, hierarchical pseudo connections are proposed for
facilitating the identity-preserving learning by introducing more appearance
variance without identity changing. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms prior art in both the visual quality and face

  in a Homology Class",,,,,"cs.CG cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Homology features of spaces which appear in applications, for instance 3D
meshes, are among the most important topological properties of these objects.
Given a non-trivial cycle in a homology class, we consider the problem of
computing a representative in that homology class which is optimal. We study
two measures of optimality, namely, the lexicographic order of cycles (the
lex-optimal cycle) and the bottleneck norm (a bottleneck-optimal cycle). We
give a simple algorithm for computing the lex-optimal cycle for a 1-homology
lass in a closed orientable surface. In contrast to this, our main result is
that, in the case of 3-Manifolds of size $n^2$ in the Euclidean 3-space, the
problem of finding a bottleneck optimal cycle cannot be solved more efficiently
than solving a system of linear equations with an $n \times n$ sparse matrix.
From this reduction, we deduce several hardness results. Most notably, we show
that for 3-manifolds given as a subset of the 3-space of size $n^2$, persistent
homology computations are at least as hard as rank computation (for sparse
matrices) while ordinary homology computations can be done in $O(n^2 \log n)$
time. This is the first such distinction between these two computations.
Moreover, it follows that the same disparity exists between the height
persistent homology computation and general sub-level set persistent homology
computation for simplicial complexes in the 3-space.

formation rate down to 6 solar masses per year using H-alpha out to a radius >
10 Mpc in each of 50 protocluster (cluster and cosmic web) fields at 1.2 < z <

galaxy kinematics with a precision < 50 km/s to deduce the 3D spatial

direct air capture of carbon dioxide driven by concentrating an alkaline
solution that has been exposed to the atmosphere and loaded with dissolved
inorganic carbon. Upon concentration, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide
increases, allowing for extraction and compression. We find that higher
concentration factors result in proportionally higher outgassing pressure, and
higher initial alkalinity concentrations at the same concentration factor
outgas a higher concentration of CO2 relative to the feed solution. We examine
two desalination technologies, reverse osmosis and capacitive deionization, as
possible implementation for the ACS, and evaluate two simplified corresponding
energy models. We compare the ACS to incumbent technologies and make estimates
on water, land, and energy requirements for capturing one million tonnes of CO2
per year. We find that estimates for the lower end of the energy range for both
reverse osmosis and capacitive deionization approaches are lower than or
roughly equal to incumbent direct air capture approaches. For most conditions,
we find an inverse relationship between the required energy and water
processing volume per million tonnes of CO2. Realizing the ACS requires a
simple alkaline aqueous solvent (e.g. potassium alkalinity carrier) and does
not require heat as a driving mechanism. More generally, the ACS can be
implemented through industrial-scale desalination approaches, meaning current
technology could be leveraged for scale-up.

there is no confirmed collisional family associated with this dwarf planet.
After a dynamical and photometric study, a sample of 156 asteroids was proposed
as candidate members of a Ceres collisional family.
  Aims: Our main objective is to study the connection between Ceres and a total
of 14 observed asteroids among the candidate's sample to explore their genetic
relationships with Ceres.
  Methods: We obtained visible spectra of these 14 asteroids using the OSIRIS
spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias(GTC). We computed spectral
slopes in two different wavelength ranges, from 0.49 to 0.80{\mu}m and from
0.80 to 0.92{\mu}m, to compare the values obtained with those on Ceres' surface
previously computed using the Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (VIR)
instrument onboard the NASA Dawn spacecraft. We also calculated the spectral
slopes in the same range for ground-based observations of Cerescollected from
the literature.
  Results: We present the visible spectra and the taxonomy of 14 observed
asteroids. We found that only two of the asteroids are spectrally compatible
with Ceres' surface. Further analysis of those two asteroids indicates that
they are spectrally young and thus less likely to be members of the Ceres
family.
  Conclusions: All in all, our results indicate that most of the 14 observed
asteroids are not likely to belong to a Ceres collisional family. Despite two
of them being spectrally compatible with the young surface of Ceres, further
evaluation is needed to confirm or reject their origin from Ceres.

a datacenter and demand high performance, strong consistency, and availability.
A key feature of datastores is data replication. The data are replicated across
servers because a single server often cannot handle the request load.
Replication is also necessary to guarantee that a server or link failure does
not render a portion of the dataset inaccessible. A replication protocol is
responsible for ensuring strong consistency between the replicas of a
datastore, even when faults occur, by determining the actions necessary to
access and manipulate the data. Consequently, a replication protocol also
drives the datastore's performance.
  Existing strongly consistent replication protocols deliver fault tolerance
but fall short in terms of performance. Meanwhile, the opposite occurs in the
world of multiprocessors, where data are replicated across the private caches
of different cores. The multiprocessor regime uses invalidations to afford
strongly consistent replication with high performance but neglects fault
tolerance.
  Although handling failures in the datacenter is critical for data
availability, we observe that the common operation is fault-free and far
exceeds the operation during faults. In other words, the common operating
environment inside a datacenter closely resembles that of a multiprocessor.
Based on this insight, we draw inspiration from the multiprocessor for
high-performance, strongly consistent replication in the datacenter. The
primary contribution of this thesis is in adapting invalidating protocols to
the nuances of replicated datastores, which include skewed data accesses, fault
tolerance, and distributed transactions.

webspace, many web service providers try to use recommender systems to
personalize their services and make accessing the content convenient.
Recommender systems that only try to increase the accuracy (i.e., the
similarity of items to users' interest) will face the long tail problem. It
means that popular items called short heads appear in the recommendation lists
more than others since they have many ratings. However, unpopular items called
long-tail items are used less than popular ones as they reduce accuracy. Other
studies that solve the long-tail problem consider users' interests constant
while their preferences change over time. We suggest that users' dynamic
preferences should be taken into account to prevent the loss of accuracy when
we use long-tail items in recommendation lists. This study shows that the two
reasons lie in the following: 1) Users rate for different proportions of
popular and unpopular items over time. 2) Users of all ages have various
interests in popular and unpopular items. As a result, recommendation lists can
be created over time with a different portion of long-tail and short-head
items. Besides, we predict the age of users based on item ratings to use more
long-tail items. The results show that by considering these two reasons, the
accuracy of recommendation lists reaches 91%. At the same time, the long tail
problem is better improved than other related research and provides better
diversity in recommendation lists in the long run.

developed but they do not reflect complicated dynamic interactions between
roads considering time and location. In this study, we propose a dynamically
localised long short-term memory (LSTM) model that involves both spatial and
temporal dependence between roads. To do so, we use a localised dynamic spatial
weight matrix along with its dynamic variation. Moreover, the LSTM model can
deal with sequential data with long dependency as well as complex non-linear
features. Empirical results indicated superior prediction performances of the
proposed model compared to two different baseline methods.

PointCLIP, which conducts alignment between CLIP-encoded point cloud and 3D

multi-view depth maps without rendering, and aggregate the view-wise zero-shot
prediction to achieve knowledge transfer from 2D to 3D. On top of that, we
design an inter-view adapter to better extract the global feature and
adaptively fuse the few-shot knowledge learned from 3D into CLIP pre-trained in

high-resolution 3D depth that is robust to back-scatter in fog, snow, and rain.
Instead of sequentially scanning a scene and directly recording depth via the
photon time-of-flight, as in pulsed LiDAR sensors, gated imagers encode depth
in the relative intensity of a handful of gated slices, captured at megapixel
resolution. Although existing methods have shown that it is possible to decode
high-resolution depth from such measurements, these methods require
synchronized and calibrated LiDAR to supervise the gated depth decoder --
prohibiting fast adoption across geographies, training on large unpaired
datasets, and exploring alternative applications outside of automotive use
cases. In this work, we fill this gap and propose an entirely self-supervised
depth estimation method that uses gated intensity profiles and temporal
consistency as a training signal. The proposed model is trained end-to-end from
gated video sequences, does not require LiDAR or RGB data, and learns to
estimate absolute depth values. We take gated slices as input and disentangle
the estimation of the scene albedo, depth, and ambient light, which are then
used to learn to reconstruct the input slices through a cyclic loss. We rely on
temporal consistency between a given frame and neighboring gated slices to
estimate depth in regions with shadows and reflections. We experimentally
validate that the proposed approach outperforms existing supervised and
self-supervised depth estimation methods based on monocular RGB and stereo
images, as well as supervised methods based on gated images.

that, by adapting to the GOT framework instead of its unsmoothed counterpart,
the curse of dimensionality for using the empirical measure to approximate the
true data generating distribution can be lifted. The current paper shows that a
related observation applies to the estimation of nonparametric mixing
distributions in discrete exponential family models, where under the GOT cost
the estimation accuracy of the nonparametric MLE can be accelerated to a
polynomial rate. This is in sharp contrast to the classical sub-polynomial
rates based on unsmoothed metrics, which cannot be improved from an

of the material like different crystal polytypes have to be considered. In this
paper, measurements on both a pad and a micro-strip SiC sensor prototype of 4H
lattice geometry are shown. The sensors were tested in the laboratory using
radioactive sources and with a proton beam in a wide intensity range (kHz-GHz)
and with different energies (60-800 MeV) available at MedAustron, an ion cancer
therapy center located in Austria. The measurements show that MIP particles
cannot be detected reliably with the used discrete electronics setup in
combination with the single-channel sensor. However, the strip sensor combined
with an ASIC-based readout electronics from the CMS/Belle-II experiments allows
to recover a certain part of the signal. This makes it possible to determine
the ionization energy and average number of electron/hole pairs generated in
the studied sensor samples.

control policies such as affine policies that are mathematically simple and
resemble many policies used in current practice. Motivated by the efficacy of

stochastic primal-dual updates that solve the SOPF without the need for prior
generation of training labels and can explicitly account for the feasibility

scattering from first principles require the use of the same nucleon-nucleon
($NN$) interaction in the structure and reaction calculations, and a consistent
treatment of the relevant operators at each order.
  Purpose: Truncation uncertainties of chiral $NN$ forces have been studied for
scattering observables in few-body systems and for bound state properties of
light nuclei. We extend this to $NA$ elastic scattering.
  Methods: With the spectator expansion of multiple scattering theory and the
no-core shell model, we use a chiral interaction from the LENPIC collaboration
to consistently calculate the leading order effective $NA$ interaction up to
third chiral order (N2LO) and extract elastic scattering observables. We
quantify the chiral truncation error using pointwise and correlated methods.
  Results: We analyze proton-$^{16}$O and neutron-$^{12}$C elastic scattering
observables between 65 and 185 MeV projectile kinetic energy. We find
qualitatively similar results for the chiral truncation uncertainties as in
few-body systems, which we assess using similar diagnostic tools. The
order-by-order convergence of the scattering observables for $^{16}$O and
$^{12}$C is reasonable near 100 MeV, but for higher energies the expansion
parameter becomes too large to converge. We find a near-perfect correlation
between the neutron differential cross section and the $NN$ Wolfenstein
amplitudes for small momentum transfers.
  Conclusions: The tools used to study the convergence of a chiral $NN$
interaction in few-body systems can be applied to $NA$ scattering with minor
changes. The $NN$ interaction used here gives a good description of $^{16}$O
and $^{12}$C scattering observables as low as 65 MeV. The very forward
direction of the neutron differential cross section mirrors the behavior of the
$NN$ interaction amazingly well.

social networks, source code abstract syntax trees). Due to the importance of
these tasks, people turned to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as the de facto
method for learning on graphs. GNNs have become widely applied due to their
convincing performance. Unfortunately, one major barrier to using GNNs is that
GNNs require substantial time and resources to train. Recently, a new method
for learning on graph data is Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) [Du, Hou,
Salakhutdinov, Poczos, Wang and Xu 19]. GNTK is an application of Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) [Jacot, Gabriel and Hongler 18] (a kernel method) on graph
data, and solving NTK regression is equivalent to using gradient descent to
train an infinite-wide neural network. The key benefit of using GNTK is that,
similar to any kernel method, GNTK's parameters can be solved directly in a
single step. This can avoid time-consuming gradient descent. Meanwhile,
sketching has become increasingly used in speeding up various optimization
problems, including solving kernel regression. Given a kernel matrix of $n$
graphs, using sketching in solving kernel regression can reduce the running
time to $o(n^3)$. But unfortunately such methods usually require extensive
knowledge about the kernel matrix beforehand, while in the case of GNTK we find
that the construction of the kernel matrix is already $O(n^2N^4)$, assuming
each graph has $N$ nodes. The kernel matrix construction time can be a major
performance bottleneck when the size of graphs $N$ increases. A natural
question to ask is thus whether we can speed up the kernel matrix construction
to improve GNTK regression's end-to-end running time. This paper provides the
first algorithm to construct the kernel matrix in $o(n^2N^3)$ running time.

investigators with their personal data and provide contaminated responses to
intentionally bias the results of the experiment. Under our new design, we

physics. However, explanations of anomalies (e.g. dark matter) rely on further
symmetry breaking calling for an undiscovered axial Higgs mode. In condensed
matter the Higgs was seen in magnetic, superconducting and charge density
wave(CDW) systems. Uncovering a low energy mode's vector properties is
challenging, requiring going beyond typical spectroscopic or scattering
techniques. Here, we discover an axial Higgs mode in the CDW system RTe3 using
the interference of quantum pathways. In RTe3 (R=La,Gd), the electronic
ordering couples bands of equal or different angular momenta. As such, the
Raman scattering tensor associated to the Higgs mode contains both symmetric
and antisymmetric components, which can be excited via two distinct, but
degenerate pathways. This leads to constructive or destructive interference of
these pathways, depending on the choice of the incident and Raman scattered
light polarization. The qualitative behavior of the Raman spectra is
well-captured by an appropriate tight-binding model including an axial Higgs
mode. The elucidation of the antisymmetric component provides direct evidence
that the Higgs mode contains an axial vector representation (i.e. a
pseudo-angular momentum) and hints the CDW in RTe3 is unconventional. Thus we
provide a means for measuring collective modes quantum properties without
resorting to extreme experimental conditions.

driving, which has become a research hot-spot in recent years. Previous methods
mainly rely on the position relationship of pedestrians to model social
interaction, which is obviously not enough to represent the complex cases in
real situations. In addition, most of existing work usually introduce the scene
interaction module as an independent branch and embed the social interaction
features in the process of trajectory generation, rather than simultaneously
carrying out the social interaction and scene interaction, which may undermine
the rationality of trajectory prediction. In this paper, we propose one new
prediction model named Social Soft Attention Graph Convolution Network (SSAGCN)
which aims to simultaneously handle social interactions among pedestrians and
scene interactions between pedestrians and environments. In detail, when
modeling social interaction, we propose a new \emph{social soft attention
function}, which fully considers various interaction factors among pedestrians.
And it can distinguish the influence of pedestrians around the agent based on
different factors under various situations. For the physical interaction, we
propose one new \emph{sequential scene sharing mechanism}. The influence of the
scene on one agent at each moment can be shared with other neighbors through
social soft attention, therefore the influence of the scene is expanded both in
spatial and temporal dimension. With the help of these improvements, we
successfully obtain socially and physically acceptable predicted trajectories.
The experiments on public available datasets prove the effectiveness of SSAGCN
and have achieved state-of-the-art results.

supergravity'') that can enlarge the space of scalar potentials, relaxing the
strongly-constrained form of the prototype supergravity potential. It has very
long been considered that in $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity a negative term of
scalar potential can be given only by the gravitino-mass term (i.e. $-3e^{G}$)
from the F-term potential, while such negative term is absent in global
supersymmetry (SUSY). In this letter, however, we firstly discover a new
negative-definite contribution to the scalar potential in $\mathcal{N}=1$
supergravity and even global SUSY. In the end, this allows us to have a general
scalar potential. To achieve this, we start with detection of a ``no-go''
theorem for the higher order corrections in minimal supergravity models of
inflation, which was investigated by Ferrara, Kallosh, Linde, and Porrati
(FKLP). Based on the no-go theorem, we establish a superconformal action of a
certain higher order correction for generating the new negative term. Then, we
identify essential constraints on the new negative term by inspecting the
suppression of the nonrenormalizable terms. We find that relaxed supergravity
has a cutoff equal to SUSY breaking scale $M_S$. This signals that
supersymmetry may be broken at high scale according to the cutoff leaving the
naturalness issue aside. We suggest that relaxed supergravity can be a
universal framework for building supergravity models of various phenomenologies
under broken SUSY from particle physics to cosmology.

could be occluded by some obstacles (e.g. trees, cars, and pedestrians) in
certain scenes. Some existing pose-guided methods solve this problem by
aligning body parts according to graph matching, but these graph-based methods
are not intuitive and complicated. Therefore, we propose a transformer-based
Pose-guided Feature Disentangling (PFD) method by utilizing pose information to
clearly disentangle semantic components (e.g. human body or joint parts) and
selectively match non-occluded parts correspondingly. First, Vision Transformer
(ViT) is used to extract the patch features with its strong capability. Second,
to preliminarily disentangle the pose information from patch information, the
matching and distributing mechanism is leveraged in Pose-guided Feature
Aggregation (PFA) module. Third, a set of learnable semantic views are
introduced in transformer decoder to implicitly enhance the disentangled body
part features. However, those semantic views are not guaranteed to be related
to the body without additional supervision. Therefore, Pose-View Matching (PVM)
module is proposed to explicitly match visible body parts and automatically
separate occlusion features. Fourth, to better prevent the interference of
occlusions, we design a Pose-guided Push Loss to emphasize the features of
visible body parts. Extensive experiments over five challenging datasets for
two tasks (occluded and holistic Re-ID) demonstrate that our proposed PFD is
superior promising, which performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

However, annealing increased lateral tensile strain decreased compressive

crystallite grain size, and strain are affected by Co layer thickness,
microstructure and periodicity are dominated by fcc-Au (111). Surface plasmon

for a given input image. However, most existing methods produce a deterministic
estimate of the clean image and are trained to minimize pixel-level distortion.
These metrics are known to be poorly correlated with human perception, and
often lead to unrealistic reconstructions. We present an alternative framework
for blind deblurring based on conditional diffusion models. Unlike existing
techniques, we train a stochastic sampler that refines the output of a
deterministic predictor and is capable of producing a diverse set of plausible
reconstructions for a given input. This leads to a significant improvement in
perceptual quality over existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple
standard benchmarks. Our predict-and-refine approach also enables much more
efficient sampling compared to typical diffusion models. Combined with a
carefully tuned network architecture and inference procedure, our method is
competitive in terms of distortion metrics such as PSNR. These results show
clear benefits of our diffusion-based method for deblurring and challenge the
widely used strategy of producing a single, deterministic reconstruction.

rise to two issues - third-party authentication and application mobility - for
continuous service during handover from 3GPP MEC to fog without
re-authentication. In this paper, we propose: 1) a proxy-based state transfer
and third-party authentication (PS3A) that uses a transparent proxy to transfer
the authentication and application state information, and 2) a token-based
state transfer and proxy-based third-party authentication (TSP3A) that uses the
proxy to transfer the authentication information and tokens to transfer the
application state from 3GPP MEC to the fog. The proxy is kept transparent with
virtual counterparts, to avoid any changes to the existing 3GPP MEC and fog
architectures. We implemented these solutions on a testbed and results show
that PS3A and TSP3A provide authentication within 0.345-2.858s for a 0-100 Mbps
proxy load. The results further show that TSP3A provides application mobility
while taking 40-52% less time than PS3A using state tokens. TSP3A and PS3A also
reduce the service interruption latency by 82.4% and 84.6%, compared to the
cloud-based service via tokens and prefetching.

inadequate testing kits like Brazil and India, radiological imaging can act as
an important diagnostic tool to accurately classify covid-19 patients and
prescribe the necessary treatment in due time. With this motivation, we present
our study based on deep learning architecture for detecting covid-19 infected
lungs using chest X-rays. Dataset: We collected a total of 2470 images for
three different class labels, namely, healthy lungs, ordinary pneumonia, and
covid-19 infected pneumonia, out of which 470 X-ray images belong to the
covid-19 category. Methods: We first pre-process all the images using histogram
equalization techniques and segment them using U-net architecture. VGG-16
network is then used for feature extraction from the pre-processed images which
is further sampled by SMOTE oversampling technique to achieve a balanced
dataset. Finally, the class-balanced features are classified using a support
vector machine (SVM) classifier with 10-fold cross-validation and the accuracy
is evaluated. Result and Conclusion: Our novel approach combining well-known

  The design of HHJ depends on many details to perform well. This paper is an
experimental and analytical study of the trade-offs in designing a robust and
dynamic HHJ operator. We revisit the design and optimization techniques
suggested by previous studies through extensive experiments, comparing them
with other algorithms designed by us or used in related studies.
  We explore the impact of the number of partitions on the performance of HHJ
and propose a lower bound and a default value for the number of partitions. We
continue by designing and evaluating different partition insertion techniques
to maximize memory utilization with the least CPU cost. In addition, we
consider a comprehensive set of algorithms for dynamically selecting a
partition to spill and compare the results against previously published
studies. We then present two alternative growth policies for spilled partitions
and study their effectiveness using experimental and model-based analyses.
  These algorithms have been implemented in the context of Apache AsterixDB and

instead driving the spin into various steady states. We find that the

flux state), separated parametrically from higher flux states, and the
instanton effects do not survive in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. By
turning on a background magnetic GNO flux in co-weight lattice corresponding to
a non-zero 't Hooft flux, we show that $N$-degenerate vacua appear at small

ripple patterns are formed. Although the conditions to form ripple patterns
have been studied well, methods to eliminate the developed ripple patterns have
not been understood thus far. Therefore, history-dependent stability of the
ripple patterns formed on a sandy surface is investigated in this study. First,
the ripple patterns are formed by sweeping the flat sandy surface with a
flexible plow at a constant speed. Then, the sweeping speed is reduced, and the
variation of ripple patterns is measured. As a result, we find that the ripple
patterns show hysteresis. Specifically, the increase in amplitude of ripples is
observed when the reduced velocity is close to the initial velocity forming the
ripple pattern. In addition, splitting of ripples is found when the reduced
velocity is further decreased. From a simple analysis of the plow's motion, we
discuss the physical mechanism of the ripple splitting.

granular deformation. As an initial state, we prepared a quasi-two-dimensional
granular pile whose apex is at the rotational axis and its initial inclination
is at the angle of repose. The rotation rate was increased from $0$ to
$620$~(rpm) and then decreased back to $0$. During the rotation, deformation of
the rotated granular pile was captured by a camera. From the acquired image
data, granular friction coefficient $\mu$ was measured as a function of the
ratio between centrifugal force and gravity, $\Gamma$. To systematically
evaluate the variation of $\mu$ both in the increasing (spinning up) and
decreasing (spinning down) rotation-rate regimes, surface profiles of the
deformed granular piles were fitted to a model considering the force balance
among gravity, friction, and centrifugal force at the surface. We found that
$\mu$ value grows in the increasing $\Gamma$ regime. However, when $\Gamma$ was
reduced, $\mu$ cannot recover its initial value. A part of the
history-dependent behaviors of the rotated granular pile can be understood by
the force balance model.

hybrid beamforming (HBF) is recognized as a promising technique utilizing a
limited number of radio frequency chains. In this work, in the presence of
extended target and clutters, a HBF design based on the subarray connection
architecture is proposed for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) DFRC
system. In this HBF, the double-phase-shifter (DPS) structure is embedded to
further increase the design flexibility. We derive the communication spectral
efficiency (SE) and radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) with
respect to the transmit HBF and radar receiver, and formulate the HBF design
problem as the SE maximization subjecting to the radar SINR and power
constraints. To solve the formulated nonconvex problem, the joinT Hybrid
bRamforming and Radar rEceiver OptimizatioN (THEREON) is proposed, in which the
radar receiver is optimized via the generalized eigenvalue decomposition, and
the transmit HBF is updated with low complexity in a parallel manner using the
consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (consensus-ADMM).
Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to the multi-user multiple-input
single-output (MU-MISO) scenario. Numerical simulations demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed algorithm and show that the solution provides a good
trade-off between number of phase shifters and performance gain of the DPS HBF.

water with different salinities is mixed, such as rivers and oceans. By
employing a semipermeable membrane to control the mixing process, the osmotic
pressure gradient energy can be generated in terms of electrical power via
pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) without causing adverse environmental impacts.
This work presents the fabrication of thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes
which are customized to offer high flux in forward osmosis (FO) and high
osmotic power in PRO. In this study, the TFN membrane was fabricated by forming
a polyamide thin film on the polysulfone substrate through the interfacial
polymerization process. One of the challenges in this process is the fouling of
PRO membranes. Fouling is one of the major characteristics that results in the
decline in the water flux of the membrane. The hydraulic pressure during PRO
processes is less than RO processes so membranes that are used for PRO are less
likely to foul. Experiments show that TFN membranes are more tolerant of
fouling than TFC membranes because of the nanomaterials which has higher
surface hydrophilicity. The structure of the membrane is a very significant
characteristic that has an influence on fouling. Especially, the structure of
porosity that is coherent to the thickness.

effective design of the unit-cell orientation angles and conformal mapping of
spatially varying, complex microstructures. We devise a parameterized
microstructure composed of rods in different directions to provide more
diversity in stiffness while retaining geometrical simplicity. The
microstructural geometry-property relationship is then surrogated by a neural
network to avoid costly homogenization. A Cartesian representation of the
unit-cell orientation is incorporated into homogenization-based optimization to
design the angles. Corresponding high-resolution multiscale structures are
obtained from the homogenization-based designs through a conformal mapping
constructed with sawtooth function fields. This allows us to assemble complex
microstructures with an oriented and compatible tiling pattern, while
preserving the local homogenized properties. To demonstrate our method with a
specific application, we optimize the frequency response of structures under
harmonic excitations within a given frequency range. It is the first time that
a sawtooth function is applied in a de-homogenization framework for complex
design scenarios beyond static compliance minimization. The examples illustrate
that multiscale structures can be generated with high efficiency and much
better dynamic performance compared with the macroscale-only optimization.
Beyond frequency response design, our proposed framework can be applied to
other general problems.

clinical approaches. Semi-supervised learning has been widely applied to
medical image segmentation tasks since it alleviates the heavy burden of
acquiring expert-examined annotations and takes the advantage of unlabeled data
which is much easier to acquire. Although consistency learning has been proven
to be an effective approach by enforcing an invariance of predictions under
different distributions, existing approaches cannot make full use of
region-level shape constraint and boundary-level distance information from
unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided mutual
consistency learning framework to effectively exploit unlabeled data by
integrating intra-task consistency learning from up-to-date predictions for
self-ensembling and cross-task consistency learning from task-level
regularization to exploit geometric shape information. The framework is guided
by the estimated segmentation uncertainty of models to select out relatively
certain predictions for consistency learning, so as to effectively exploit more
reliable information from unlabeled data. Experiments on two publicly available
benchmark datasets showed that: 1) Our proposed method can achieve significant
performance improvement by leveraging unlabeled data, with up to 4.13% and
9.82% in Dice coefficient compared to supervised baseline on left atrium

conduct the clustering process by measuring similarity of probability

routers across various types of on-chip networks in chip muiltiprocessors

from the input buffers inside Network-on-Chip (NoC) routers, which are
traditionally designed to maximize performance. To mitigate this high energy
cost, many works propose bufferless router designs that utilize deflection
routing to resolve port contention. While this approach is able to maintain
high performance relative to its buffered counterparts at low network traffic,

two major modifications to improve the overall performance of the traditional
bufferless network-on-chip design. The first modification is a
minimally-buffered design that introduces limited buffering inside critical
parts of the on-chip network in order to reduce the number of deflections. The
second modification is a hierarchical bufferless interconnect design that aims
to further improve performance by limiting the number of hops each packet needs
to travel while in the network. In both approaches, we discuss design tradeoffs

properties. Fixed-aperture fiber spectroscopy suffers from aperture effects:
the fraction of the galaxy covered by the fiber varies depending on its
projected size on the sky, thus measured properties are not representative of
the whole galaxy. The advent of Integral Field Spectroscopy has provided a way
for correcting the missing light, by studying how these galaxy parameters
change with the aperture size. Here we study how the standard SN host galaxy
relations change once global host galaxy parameters are corrected for aperture
effects. We recover previous trends on SN Hubble residuals with host galaxy
properties, but we find that discarding objects with poor fiber coverage
instead of correcting for aperture loss introduces biases in the sample that
affect SN host galaxy relations. The net effect of applying the commonly used
$g$-band fraction criterion is discarding intrinsically faint \mbox{SNe~Ia} in
high-mass galaxies, thus artificially increasing the height of the mass step by
0.02 mag and its significance. Current and next generation of fixed-aperture

role in problems in machine learning. In this article, we do not assume to have
knowledge of the moments or expansion terms of the random fields but we instead
have only given discretized samples for them. We thus model some measurement
process for this discrete information and then approximate the covariance
operator of the original random field. Of course, the true covariance operator
is of infinite rank and hence we can not assume to get an accurate
approximation from a finite number of spatially discretized observations. On
the other hand, smoothness of the true (unknown) covariance function results in
effective low rank approximations to the true covariance operator. We derive
explicit error estimates that involve the finite rank approximation error of
the covariance operator, the Monte-Carlo-type errors for sampling in the
stochastic domain and the numerical discretization error in the physical
domain. This permits to give sufficient conditions on the three discretization
parameters to guarantee that an error below a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$
is achieved.

distance Laplacian energy $DLE(G)$ is defined as
$DLE(G)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|\rho^{L}_i-\frac{2 W(G)}{n}\right|$, where $W(G)$
is the Wiener index of $G$. We obtain a relationship between the Laplacian
energy and distance Laplacian energy for graphs with diameter 2. We obtain
lower bounds for the distance Laplacian energy $DLE(G)$ in terms of the order
$n$, the Wiener index $W(G)$, independence number, vertex connectivity number
and other given parameters. We characterize the extremal graphs attaining these
bounds. We show that the complete bipartite graph has the minimum distance
Laplacian energy among all connected bipartite graphs and complete split graph
has the minimum distance Laplacian energy among all connected graphs with given

join of a graph with the union of two other graphs. We show that the graph

behavior and decisions by giving us personalized suggestions. Services like
Kindle, Youtube, and Netflix depend heavily on the performance of their
recommender systems to ensure that their users have a good experience and to
increase revenues. Despite their popularity, it has been shown that recommender
systems reproduce and amplify the bias present in the real world. The resulting
feedback creates a self-perpetuating loop that deteriorates the user experience
and results in homogenizing recommendations over time. Further, biased
recommendations can also reinforce stereotypes based on gender or ethnicity,
thus reinforcing the filter bubbles that we live in. In this paper, we address
the problem of gender bias in recommender systems with explicit feedback. We
propose a model to quantify the gender bias present in book rating datasets and
in the recommendations produced by the recommender systems. Our main
contribution is to provide a principled approach to mitigate the bias being
produced in the recommendations. We theoretically show that the proposed
approach provides unbiased recommendations despite biased data. Through
empirical evaluation on publicly available book rating datasets, we further
show that the proposed model can significantly reduce bias without significant
impact on accuracy. Our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any
recommender system. To demonstrate the performance of our model, we present the
results on four recommender algorithms, two from the K-nearest neighbors
family, UserKNN and ItemKNN, and the other two from the matrix factorization

settling is the process of sedimentation of flocculated particles (biomass;
activated sludge) consisting of several material components that react with
substrates dissolved in the fluid. An SBR is operated in cycles of consecutive
fill, react, settle, draw and idle stages, which means that the volume in the
tank varies and the surface moves with time. The process is modelled by a
system of spatially one-dimensional, nonlinear, strongly degenerate parabolic
convection-diffusion-reaction equations. This system is coupled via conditions
of mass conservation to transport equations on a half line whose origin is
located at a moving boundary and that models the effluent pipe. A
finite-difference scheme is proved to satisfy an invariant-region property (in

speak in their daily lives. Without early diagnosis and treatment, these
disorders may deteriorate drastically. Thus, automatic classification systems
at home are desirable for people who are inaccessible to clinical disease
assessments. However, the performance of such systems may be weakened due to
the constrained resources and domain mismatch between the clinical data and
noisy real-world data. Methods: This study develops a compact and domain-robust
voice disorder classification system to identify the utterances of health,
neoplasm, and benign structural diseases. Our proposed system utilizes a
feature extractor model composed of factorized convolutional neural networks
and subsequently deploys domain adversarial training to reconcile the domain
mismatch by extracting domain invariant features. Results: The results show
that the unweighted average recall in the noisy real-world domain improved by
13% and remained at 80% in the clinic domain with only slight degradation. The
domain mismatch was effectively eliminated. Moreover, the proposed system
reduced the usage of both memory and computation by over 73.9%. Conclusion: By
deploying factorized convolutional neural networks and domain adversarial
training, domain-invariant features can be derived for voice disorder
classification with limited resources. The promising results confirm that the
proposed system can significantly reduce resource consumption and improve
classification accuracy by considering the domain mismatch. Significance: To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that jointly considers
real-world model compression and noise-robustness issues in voice disorder
classification. The proposed system is intended for application to embedded

learning techniques -- have been designed to maximize the clean performance
(e.g. accuracy) and have disregarded robustness, an important quality property
that has received increasing attention. Active learning, therefore, produces
models that are accurate but not robust.
  In this paper, we propose \emph{robust active learning}, an active learning
process that integrates adversarial training -- the most established method to
produce robust models. Via an empirical study on 11 acquisition functions, 4
datasets, 6 DNN architectures, and 15105 trained DNNs, we show that robust
active learning can produce models with the robustness (accuracy on adversarial
examples) ranging from 2.35\% to 63.85\%, whereas standard active learning
systematically achieves negligible robustness (less than 0.20\%). Our study
also reveals, however, that the acquisition functions that perform well on
accuracy are worse than random sampling when it comes to robustness. We,
therefore, examine the reasons behind this and devise a new acquisition
function that targets both clean performance and robustness. Our acquisition
function -- named density-based robust sampling with entropy (DRE) --
outperforms the other acquisition functions (including random) in terms of
robustness by up to 24.40\% (3.84\% than random particularly), while remaining
competitive on accuracy. Additionally, we prove that DRE is applicable as a
test selection metric for model retraining and stands out from all compared

simulate the flow around a low pressure turbine stator using the pix2pixHD

rotating wake in front of the stator. The settings of adversarial training and
the effects of using specific GAN architectures are explained. We thereby show
that GAN are efficient in simulating turbulence in technically challenging flow

inference times significantly fall short when compared with classical numerical
methods, in particular LES, while still providing turbulent flows in high

ability of the conditional GAN to generalize over changes of geometry by
generating turbulent flow fields for positions of the wake that are not

spatial assembling while still constrained by nodes' saturation. In particular,
we prove that the core-periphery structure of the networked landscape triggers
the spontaneous emergence of vacant habitat patches, which segregate the
population in multistable patterns of isolated (sub)communities separated by
empty patches. Furthermore, a quantisation effect in the number of vacant
patches is observed once the total system mass varies continuously, emphasising
thus a striking feature of the robustness of population stationary

fragmented habitat of the Glanville fritillary butterfly Melitaea cinxia, an

  arXiv:2009.11492",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we are concerned with the existence of transonic shocks for 2-D
steady isothermal Euler flows in a horizontal flat nozzle under vertical
gravity. In particular, we focus on the contribution of the vertical gravity in
determining the position of the shock front. For steady horizontal flows, the
existence of normal shocks with the position of the shock front being arbitrary
in the nozzle can be easily established. This paper will try to determine the
position of the shock front as the state of the flow at the entrance of the
nozzle and the pressure at the exit are slightly perturbed. To this end, this
paper proposes a free boundary problem of the linearized Euler system with
vertical gravity, whose solution could be an initial approximation for the
shock solution with the free boundary being the approximation for the shock
front. Due to the existence of the vertical gravity, difficulties arise in
solving the boundary value problem in the approximate subsonic domain behind
the shock front. The linearized Euler system is elliptic-hyperbolic composite
for subsonic flows, and the elliptic part and the hyperbolic part are coupled
in the $0$-order terms depending on the acceleration of gravity $g$. Moreover,
the coefficients are not constants since the unperturbed shock solution depends
on the vertical variable. New ideas and techniques are developed to deal with
these difficulties and, under certain sufficient conditions on the
perturbation, the existence of the solution to the proposed free boundary
problem is established as the acceleration of gravity $g>0$ and the
perturbation are sufficiently small. Then, with the obtained initial
approximation of the shock solution, a nonlinear iteration scheme can be
constructed which leads to a transonic shock solution with the position of the
shock front being close to the initial approximating position.

evidence-comment pairs from all PubMed indexed COVID-19 publications with
formal published comments. WHO guidelines were utilized to validate the
feasibility of comment-derived evidence assertions as a fast decision

assertions of leading subgraphs of 5 drugs were consistent with WHO guidelines,
and the overall comment sentiment of 6 drugs was aligned with WHO clinical

as an evidence appraisal tool for heuristic decisions based on the accuracy,

the general case where all disorder vertices are considered, it turns out that
there is no stable fixed point and the low-energy RG flows are governed by the

clear objective. An example that is well-studied is the category of
life-and-death (L&D) problems for Go, which helps players hone their skill of
identifying region safety. Many previous methods like lambda search try null
moves first, then derive so-called relevance zones (RZs), outside of which the
opponent does not need to search. This paper first proposes a novel RZ-based
approach, called the RZ-Based Search (RZS), to solving L&D problems for Go. RZS
tries moves before determining whether they are null moves post-hoc. This means
we do not need to rely on null move heuristics, resulting in a more elegant
algorithm, so that it can also be seamlessly incorporated into AlphaZero's
super-human level play in our solver. To repurpose AlphaZero for solving, we
also propose a new training method called Faster to Life (FTL), which modifies
AlphaZero to entice it to win more quickly. We use RZS and FTL to solve L&D
problems on Go, namely solving 68 among 106 problems from a professional L&D
book while a previous program solves 11 only. Finally, we discuss that the
approach is generic in the sense that RZS is applicable to solving many other
goal-achieving problems for board games.

analytical results we consider some specific regimes of the parameter space. We
find that the non-conformal effects decrease the redefined HEE and increase the

interaction (HCI). Conventional eye-tracking system using single-model fixation
duration possibly issues commands ignoring users' real expectation. In the
current study, an eye-brain hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) interaction
system was introduced for intention detection through fusion of multi-modal
eye-track and ERP (a measurement derived from EEG) features. Eye-track and EEG
data were recorded from 64 healthy participants as they performed a 40-min
customized free search task of a fixed target icon among 25 icons. The
corresponding fixation duration of eye-tracking and ERP were extracted. Five
previously-validated LDA-based classifiers (including RLDA, SWLDA, BLDA, SKLDA,
and STDA) and the widely-used CNN method were adopted to verify the efficacy of
feature fusion from both offline and pseudo-online analysis, and optimal
approach was evaluated through modulating the training set and system response
duration. Our study demonstrated that the input of multi-modal eye-track and
ERP features achieved superior performance of intention detection in the single
trial classification of active search task. And compared with single-model ERP
feature, this new strategy also induced congruent accuracy across different
classifiers. Moreover, in comparison with other classification methods, we
found that the SKLDA exhibited the superior performance when fusing feature in
offline test (ACC=0.8783, AUC=0.9004) and online simulation with different
sample amount and duration length. In sum, the current study revealed a novel
and effective approach for intention classification using eye-brain hybrid BCI,
and further supported the real-life application of hands-free HCI in a more
precise and stable manner.

phase shifts between two light beams. Simple input states -- such as coherent
states or single photons -- can reach the standard quantum limit of phase
estimation while more complicated states can be used to reach Heisenberg
scaling; the latter, however, require complex states at the input of the
interferometer which are difficult to prepare. The quest for highly sensitive
phase estimation therefore calls for interferometers with nonlinear devices
which would make the preparation of these complex states more efficient. Here,
we show that the Heisenberg scaling can be recovered with simple input states
(including Fock and coherent states) when the linear mirrors in the
interferometer are replaced with controlled-swap gates and measurements on
ancilla qubits. These swap tests project the input Fock and coherent states
onto NOON and entangled coherent states, respectively, leading to improved
sensitivity to small phase shifts in one of the interferometer arms. We perform
detailed analysis of ancilla errors, showing that biasing the ancilla towards
phase flips offers a great advantage, and perform thorough numerical
simulations of a possible implementation in circuit quantum electrodynamics.
Our results thus present a viable approach to phase estimation approaching
Heisenberg-limited sensitivity.

Design/methodology/approach: Taking cardiovascular research publications in

hedging/conflicting uncertainties as the knowledge context. We introduced
Information Entropy and Uncertainty Rate as potential metrics to quantity the
uncertainty of biomedical knowledge claims represented at different levels,
such as the SPO triples (micro level), as well as the semantic type pairs
(micro-level). Findings: The results indicated that while the number of
scientific publications and total SPO triples showed a liner growth, the novel
SPO triples occurring per year remained stable. After examining the frequency
of uncertain cue words in different part of scientific statements, we found
hedging words tend to appear in conclusive and purposeful sentences, whereas
conflicting terms often appear in background and act as the premise (e.g.,
unsettled scientific issues) of the work to be investigated. Practical
implications: Our approach identified major uncertain knowledge areas, such as
diagnostic biomarkers, genetic characteristics, and pharmacologic therapies
surrounding cardiovascular diseases in China. These areas are suggested to be
prioritized in which new hypotheses need to be verified, and disputes,
conflicts, as well as contradictions to be settled further.

gradient methods, that is, conjugate gradient methods on Riemannian manifolds.
The conjugate gradient methods are important first-order optimization
algorithms both in Euclidean spaces and on Riemannian manifolds. While various
types of conjugate gradient methods are studied in Euclidean spaces, there have
been fewer studies on those on Riemannian manifolds. In each iteration of the
Riemannian conjugate gradient methods, the previous search direction must be
transported to the current tangent space so that it can be added to the
negative gradient of the objective function at the current point. There are
several approaches to transport a tangent vector to another tangent space.
Therefore, there are more variants of the Riemannian conjugate gradient methods
than the Euclidean case. In order to investigate them in more detail, the
proposed framework unifies the existing Riemannian conjugate gradient methods
such as ones utilizing a vector transport or inverse retraction and also
develops other methods that have not been covered in previous studies.
Furthermore, sufficient conditions for the convergence of a class of algorithms
in the proposed framework are clarified. Moreover, the global convergence
properties of several specific types of algorithms are extensively analyzed.
The analyses provide the theoretical results for some algorithms in a more
general setting than the existing studies and completely new developments for
the other algorithms. Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the
validity of the theoretical results. The results also compare the performances
of several specific algorithms in the proposed framework.

pre-inflationary bounce avoids the cosmic singularity, and for the eras before
and after the quasi-de Sitter inflationary stage, approximately satisfies the
string theory motivated scale factor duality $a(t)=a^{-1}(-t)$. We investigate
which approximate forms of $f(R)$ can realize such a non-singular
pre-inflationary scenario, the quasi-de Sitter patch of which is described by
an $R^2$ gravity, thus the exit from inflation is guaranteed. Furthermore,
since in string theory pre-Big Bang scenarios lead to an overall amplification
of the gravitational wave energy spectrum, we examine in detail this
perspective for the $f(R)$ gravity generating this pre-inflationary
non-singular bounce. As we show, in the $f(R)$ gravity case, the energy
spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves background is also amplified,
however the drawback is that the amplification is too small to be detected by
future high frequency interferometers. Thus we conclude that, as in the case of
single scalar field theories, $f(R)$ gravity cannot produce detectable
stochastic gravitational waves and a synergistic theory of scalars and higher
order curvature terms might be needed.

The latter symmetry entails upon the modified 4D massive Abelian 2-form gauge
theory to become a massive model of Hodge theory within the framework of
Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism where there is existence of a set of
(anti-)co-BRST transformations corresponding to the usual nilpotent (anti-)BRST
transformations. The latter exist in any arbitrary dimension of spacetime for
the usual St$\ddot u$ckelberg-modified massive Abelian 2-form gauge theory. The
modification in the St$\ddot u$ckelberg technique is backed by the precise
mathematical arguments from the differential geometry where the exterior
derivative and Hodge duality operator play the decisive roles. The modified
version of the St$\ddot u$ckelberg technique remains invariant under the
discrete duality transformations which also establish a precise and deep
connection between the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST

procedures, the variation of operation styles, and the fast development of new
surgical skills, the surgical skill assessment remains a challenging problem.
This work presents a novel Gaussian Process Learning-based heuristic automatic
objective surgical skill assessment method for ESSBSs. Different with classical
surgical skill assessment algorithms, the proposed method 1) utilizes the
kinematic features in surgical instrument relative movements, instead of using
specific surgical tasks or the statistics to assess skills in real-time; 2)
provide informative feedback, instead of a summative scores; 3) has the ability
to incrementally learn from new data, instead of depending on a fixed dataset.
The proposed method projects the instrument movements into the endoscope

features of the projected data and learns the relationship between surgical
skill levels and the features with the Gaussian Process learning technique. The
proposed method was verified in full endoscopic skull base and sinus surgeries

learning paired audio-visual correlation embedding and category correlation
embedding as constraints to reinforce the mutuality of audio-visual

encode audio data and visual data into two different latent spaces. Further,
two mutual latent spaces are respectively constructed by canonical correlation

hafnium dioxide largely determine the prospects for applying the latter in new
generation devices of optoelectronics and nanoelectronics. In this work, we
have studied the diffuse reflectance spectra at room temperature for a
nominally pure nanostructured $HfO_2$ powder with a monoclinic crystal
structure and, as well its photoluminescence in the temperature range of 40 -
300 K. We have also estimated the bandgap $E_g$ under the assumption made for
indirect (5.31 eV) and direct (5.61 eV) allowed transitions. We have detected
emission with a 4.2 eV maximum at T < 200 K and conducted an analysis of the
experimental dependencies to evaluate the activation energies of thermal
quenching (140 meV) and enhancement (3 meV) processes. Accounting for both the
temperature behavior of the spectral characteristics and the estimation of the
Huang-Rhys factor S >> 1 has shown that radiative decay of self-trapped
excitons forms the mechanism of the indicated emission. In this case, the
localization is mainly due to the interaction of holes with active vibrational
modes of oxygen atoms in non-equivalent ($O_{3f}$ and $O_{4f}$) crystal
positions. Thorough study of the discussed excitonic effects can advance
development of hafnia-based structures with a controlled optical response.

to drive in busy city streets safely and efficiently. The future autonomous
cars need to fit into mixed conditions with not only technical but also social
capabilities. As more algorithms and datasets have been developed to predict
pedestrian behaviors, these efforts lack the benchmark labels and the
capability to estimate the temporal-dynamic intent changes of the pedestrians,
provide explanations of the interaction scenes, and support algorithms with
social intelligence. This paper proposes and shares another benchmark dataset
called the IUPUI-CSRC Pedestrian Situated Intent (PSI) data with two innovative
labels besides comprehensive computer vision labels. The first novel label is
the dynamic intent changes for the pedestrians to cross in front of the
ego-vehicle, achieved from 24 drivers with diverse backgrounds. The second one
is the text-based explanations of the driver reasoning process when estimating
pedestrian intents and predicting their behaviors during the interaction
period. These innovative labels can enable several computer vision tasks,
including pedestrian intent/behavior prediction, vehicle-pedestrian interaction
segmentation, and video-to-language mapping for explainable algorithms. The
released dataset can fundamentally improve the development of pedestrian
behavior prediction models and develop socially intelligent autonomous cars to
interact with pedestrians efficiently. The dataset has been evaluated with
different tasks and is released to the public to access.

distribution of NSBH systems, whose shape is consistent with that inferred from
the GW binary BH (BBH) primaries, can be well described as a power-law with an
index of $\alpha = 4.8^{+4.5}_{-2.8}$ plus a high-mass Gaussian component
peaking at $\sim33^{+14}_{-9}\,M_\odot$. The NS mass spectrum could be shaped
as a near flat distribution between $\sim1.0-2.1\,M_\odot$. The constrained NS
maximum mass agrees with that inferred from NSs in our Galaxy. If GW190814 and
GW200210 are NSBH mergers, the posterior results of the NS maximum mass would
be always larger than $\sim2.5\,M_\odot$ and significantly deviate from that
inferred in the Galactic NSs. The effective inspiral spin and effective
precession spin of GW NSBH mergers are measured to potentially have near-zero
distributions. The negligible spins for GW NSBH mergers imply that most events
in the universe should be plunging events, which supports the standard isolated
formation channel of NSBH binaries. More NSBH mergers to be discovered in the
fourth observing run would help to more precisely model the population

and urgent problem. Although a big enough dataset can be directly generated by
contingency simulation, this data generation process is usually cumbersome and
inefficient; while data augmentation provides a low-cost and efficient way to
artificially inflate the representative and diversified training datasets with
label preserving transformations. In this respect, this paper proposes a novel
deep-learning intelligent system incorporating data augmentation for STVSA of
power systems. First, due to the unavailability of reliable quantitative
criteria to judge the stability status for a specific power system,
semi-supervised cluster learning is leveraged to obtain labeled samples in an
original small dataset. Second, to make deep learning applicable to the small
dataset, conditional least squares generative adversarial networks
(LSGAN)-based data augmentation is introduced to expand the original dataset
via artificially creating additional valid samples. Third, to extract temporal
dependencies from the post-disturbance dynamic trajectories of a system, a
bi-directional gated recurrent unit with attention mechanism based assessment
model is established, which bi-directionally learns the significant time
dependencies and automatically allocates attention weights. The test results
demonstrate the presented approach manages to achieve better accuracy and a
faster response time with original small datasets. Besides classification
accuracy, this work employs statistical measures to comprehensively examine the

heterogeneous energy capacity problem, each device in SlimFL runs a

successively decoded after reception as the 0.5x or $1.0$x model depending on

a potential threat to network ownership protection, since the knowledge
contained in network can be effortlessly distilled and hence exposed to a
malicious user. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, termed as Safe
Distillation Box (SDB), that allows us to wrap a pre-trained model in a virtual

inference capability of the wrapped model to all users, but precludes KD from
unauthorized users. For authorized users, on the other hand, SDB carries out a
knowledge augmentation scheme to strengthen the KD performances and the results
of the student model. In other words, all users may employ a model in SDB for
inference, but only authorized users get access to KD from the model. The
proposed SDB imposes no constraints over the model architecture, and may
readily serve as a plug-and-play solution to protect the ownership of a

demonstrate that, with SDB, the performance of an unauthorized KD drops

Specifically, by combining with the recent Noise2Score self-supervised image

we can provide a general closed-form denoising formula that can be used for
large classes of noise distributions without ever knowing the underlying noise
distribution. Similar to the original Noise2Score, the new approach is composed
of two successive steps: score matching using perturbed noisy images, followed
by a closed form image denoising formula via distribution-independent Tweedie's
formula. This also suggests a systematic algorithm to estimate the noise model

  Uncertainty-aware Semantic Segmentation in Point Clouds",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation of the point clouds includes the
predictive uncertainty estimation and the uncertainty-guided model
optimization. One key challenge in the task is the efficiency of point-wise
predictive distribution establishment. The widely-used MC dropout establishes
the distribution by computing the standard deviation of samples using multiple
stochastic forward propagations, which is time-consuming for tasks based on
point clouds containing massive points. Hence, a framework embedded with NSA-MC
dropout, a variant of MC dropout, is proposed to establish distributions in
just one forward pass. Specifically, the NSA-MC dropout samples the model many
times through a space-dependent way, outputting point-wise distribution by
aggregating stochastic inference results of neighbors. Based on this, aleatoric
and predictive uncertainties acquire from the predictive distribution. The
aleatoric uncertainty is integrated into the loss function to penalize noisy
points, avoiding the over-fitting of the model to some degree. Besides, the
predictive uncertainty quantifies the confidence degree of predictions.
Experimental results show that our framework obtains better segmentation
results of real-world point clouds and efficiently quantifies the credibility
of results. Our NSA-MC dropout is several times faster than MC dropout, and the
inference time does not establish a coupling relation with the sampling times.
The code will be available if the paper is accepted.
