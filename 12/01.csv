intracluster medium (ICM) because they trace the relativistic cosmic rays in

low-energy cosmic rays, low-frequency radio observations are especially
interesting because they unveil emission powered by low-efficiency particle
acceleration processes, which are believed to play a crucial role in the origin
of diffuse radio emission. We investigate the origin of the radio mini-halo at
the center of the galaxy cluster 2A0335+096 and its connection to the central

head-tail galaxy GB6 B0335+096 hosted in the cluster to explore the lifecycle
of the relativistic electrons in its radio tails. We use new LOw Frequency
ARray (LOFAR) observations from the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey at 144 MHz to
map the low-frequency emission with a high level of detail. The new data were
combined with archival Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Chandra observations
to carry out a multi-wavelength study. We have made the first measurement of
the spectral index of the mini-halo ($\alpha=-1.2\pm0.1$ between 144 MHz and
1.4 GHz) and the lobes of the central source ($\alpha\simeq-1.5\pm0.1$ between
144 and 610 MHz). Based on the low-frequency radio emission morphology with
respect to the thermal ICM, we propose that the origin of the diffuse radio
emission is linked to the sloshing of the cool core. The new data revealed the
presence of a Mpc-long radio tail associated with GB6 B0335+096. The observed
projected length is a factor 3 longer than the expected cooling length, with
evidence of flattening in the spectral index trend along the tail. Therefore,
we suggest that the electrons toward the end of the tail are kept alive by the

they promise ultra-fast, deflection-free dynamics whilst being robust against

materials hosting such textures is key to developing this technology. Here, we
present comprehensive micromagnetic and analytical models investigating
topological textures in the broad material class of A-type antiferromagnets,
specifically focusing on the prototypical case of $\alpha \text{-Fe}_2
\text{O}_3$,an emerging candidate for AFM spintronics. By exploiting a symmetry
breaking interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI), it is possible
to stabilize a wide topological family, including AFM (anti)merons and bimerons
and the hitherto undiscovered AFM skyrmions. Whilst iDMI enforces homochirality
and improves the stability of these textures, the widely tunable anisotropy and
exchange interactions enable unprecedented control of their core dimensions. We
then present a unifying framework to model the scaling of texture sizes based
on a simple dimensional analysis. As the parameters required to host and tune
homochiral AFM textures may be obtained by rational materials design of $\alpha

AFM topological spintronics.

result, scientists may experience anomie and adopt innovative ways to cope.
These often value quantity over quality and may even compromise research

a decrease in research quality. In the language of rational choice theory, an
evaluation gap persists if motivational factors arising out of the internal

assortative/homophilic behaviour, where nodes are more likely to be connected

multi-scale fashion to overcome well known limitations of classic scores. Such
multi-scale strategies can capture heterogeneous behaviors among node
homophily, but they ignore an important, often available, addendum in
real-world systems: the time when edges are present and the time-varying paths
they form accordingly. Hence, temporal homophily is still little understood in

nature. A precise description of these processes in atomic nuclei requires
comprehensive knowledge on both the strong and weak interactions in the nuclear
medium and on the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In particular, an
observation of the hypothetical double beta decay without emission of neutrinos
($0\nu\beta\beta$) would unambiguously demonstrate the Majorana nature of
neutrinos and the existence of the lepton-number-violation process. It would
also provide unique information on the ordering and absolute scale of neutrino
masses. The next-generation tonne-scale experiments with sensitivity up to
$10^{28}$ years after a few years of running will probably provide a definite
answer to these fundamental questions based on our current knowledge on the
nuclear matrix element (NME), the precise determination of which is a challenge
to nuclear theory. Beyond-mean-field approaches have been frequently adapted
for the study of nuclear structure and decay throughout the nuclear chart for
several decades. In this review, we summarize the status of beyond-mean-field
calculations of the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay assuming the standard
mechanism of an exchange of light Majorana neutrinos. The challenges and
prospects in the extension and application of beyond-mean-field approaches for
$0\nu\beta\beta$ decay are discussed.

pulsating white dwarfs, GD~358, is the focus of the present paper. We report a
thorough asteroseismological analysis of the DBV star GD~358 (TIC~219074038)
based on new high-precision photometric data gathered by the {\it TESS} space
mission combined with data taken from the Earth. In total, we detected 26
periodicities from the {\it TESS} light curve of this DBV star using a standard
pre-whitening. The oscillation frequencies are associated with nonradial
$g$(gravity)-mode pulsations with periods from $\sim 422$ s to $\sim 1087$ s.
Moreover, we detected 8 combination frequencies between $\sim 543$ s and $\sim
295$ s. We combined these data with a huge amount of observations from the
ground. We found a constant period spacing of $39.25\pm0.17$ s, which helped us
to infer its mass ($M_{\star}= 0.588\pm0.024 M_{\sun}$) and constrain the
harmonic degree $\ell$ of the modes. We carried out a period-fit analysis on
GD~358, and we were successful in finding an asteroseismological model with a
stellar mass ($M_{\star}= 0.584^{+0.025}_{-0.019} M_{\sun}$), in line with the
spectroscopic mass ($M_{\star}= 0.560\pm0.028 M_{\sun}$). We found that the
frequency splittings vary according to the radial order of the modes,
suggesting differential rotation. Obtaining a seismological made it possible to
estimate the seismological distance ($d_{\rm seis}= 42.85\pm 0.73$ pc) of
GD~358, which is in very good accordance with the precise astrometric distance
measured by {\it GAIA} EDR3 ($\pi= 23.244\pm 0.024, d_{\rm GAIA}= 43.02\pm

finite-$\beta$, fixed- and free-boundary optimization of SPEC equilibria for
good magnetic surfaces. The objective function is constructed with the Greene's
residue of selected rational surfaces and the optimization is driven by the
SIMSOPT framework [M. Landreman et al., J. Open Source Software 6, 3525

of a perfectly conducting wall surrounding the plasma (fixed-boundary case), or
the coils (free-boundary case), in a reasonable amount of computational time.
This work shows that SPEC can be used as an equilibrium code both in a two-step

Knudsen number which allows us to obtain non trivial hydrodynamic behavior. In
such a regime, we construct strong solutions to the inelastic Boltzmann

of conceptual models taken from all sorts of climate system components on
multiple spatial scales. By analysis of the bifurcation structure of such

with part of the spatial domain in one state, and part in another, with a
spatial interface between these regions. These coexistence states critically
depend on the size and the spatial heterogeneity of the (sub)system. In
particular, in these systems a tipping point might lead to a partial tipping of

The problem of taking advantage of background information in data clustering is

algorithm efficiently manages to solve real-world instances up to 800 data

with a generic number of features. This problem size is about four times larger

operator and compute its standard deviation for wave functions confined to a
geodesic ball on a spacelike hypersurface. Its radius can then be understood as
a measure of position uncertainty. Under the assumtion of small position
uncertainties in comparison to background curvature length scales, we obtain
the corresponding corrections to the uncertainty relation in flat space. Those
depend on the Ricci scalar of the effective spatial metric, the particle is
moving on, and, if there are nonvanishing time-space components of the
spacetime metric, gradients of the shift vector and the lapse function.

non-Joy and anti-Hale active regions resulted in the remnant flux surges that
disturbed the usual order in magnetic flux transport. We finally show that the
leading-polarity surges during cycle minima sometimes link the following cycle
and a collective effect of these surges may lead to secular changes in solar
activity. The magnetic field from a Babcock--Leighton dynamo model generally
agrees with these observations.

encoders is considered, whereby Transmitter 2 performs a measurement on a

perfect cribbing is impossible. This leads to the introduction of a MAC model
with noisy cribbing. In the causal and non-causal cribbing scenarios,
Transmitter 2 performs the measurement before the input of Transmitter 1 is
sent through the channel. Hence, Transmitter 2's cribbing may inflict a ""state

Furthermore, a regularized capacity characterization is established for robust
cribbing, i.e. when the cribbing system contains all the information of the
channel input. Building on the analogy between the noisy cribbing model and the
relay channel, a partial decode-forward region is derived for a quantum MAC
with non-robust cribbing. For the classical-quantum MAC with cribbing encoders,
the capacity region is determined with perfect cribbing of the classical input,
and a cutset region is derived for noisy cribbing. In the special case of a

and body height as well as Bonnavion and Cadot's experiment (Bonnavion et al.

energetic, antisymmetric POD mode. However switches are also characterized by a
global base suction decrease, as well as deformations in both vertical and
lateral directions, which all correspond to large-scale symmetric modes. Most
of the base suction reduction is due to the two most energetic symmetric modes.

that the large scales of the near-wake velocity field can be recovered to some

computationally cheaper (low-fidelity) model in combination with an appropriate
correction approach, which improves the accuracy of the low-fidelity model. To
construct a computationally cheap low-fidelity model, we tested three different
approaches to compute an approximation of the annual periodic solution (i.e., a

spin-up iterations (several decades instead of millennia), secondly, an
artificial neural network (ANN) approximating the steady annual cycle and,

using only the ANN, the SBO yielded a solution close to the target and reduced
the computational effort significantly. If an ANN approximating appropriately a

missing capabilities that will address objectives central to a broad range of
modern astrophysics. The UVEX design has two co-aligned wide-field imagers
operating in the FUV and NUV and a powerful broadband medium resolution
spectrometer. In its two-year baseline mission, UVEX will perform a
multi-cadence synoptic all-sky survey 50/100 times deeper than GALEX in the
NUV/FUV, cadenced surveys of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, rapid
target of opportunity followup, as well as spectroscopic followup of samples of
stars and galaxies. The science program is built around three pillars. First,
UVEX will explore the low-mass, low-metallicity galaxy frontier through imaging
and spectroscopic surveys that will probe key aspects of the evolution of
galaxies by understanding how star formation and stellar evolution at low
metallicities affect the growth and evolution of low-metallicity, low-mass
galaxies in the local universe. Such galaxies contain half the mass in the
local universe, and are analogs for the first galaxies, but observed at
distances that make them accessible to detailed study. Second, UVEX will
explore the dynamic universe through time-domain surveys and prompt
spectroscopic followup capability will probe the environments, energetics, and
emission processes in the early aftermaths of gravitational wave-discovered
compact object mergers, discover hot, fast UV transients, and diagnose the
early stages of stellar explosions. Finally, UVEX will become a key community
resource by leaving a large all-sky legacy data set, enabling a wide range of
scientific studies and filling a gap in the new generation of wide-field,
sensitive optical and infrared surveys provided by the Rubin, Euclid, and Roman
observatories. This paper discusses the scientific potential of UVEX, and the
broad scientific program.

monoids with a presentation of the form $\operatorname{Inv}\langle A \mid w=1

one-relator groups which can be defined by special one-relation inverse monoid
presentations in which the defining word is arbitrary; reduced; cyclically
reduced; or positive, respectively. We show that the inclusions ${\rm {\small

Conditional on a natural conjecture, we prove ${\rm {\small ANY}} \supset {\rm

Gray & Ruskuc to produce an infinite family of special one-relation inverse
monoids which exhibit similar pathological behaviour (which we term O'Haresque)
to the O'Hare monoid with respect to computing the minimal invertible pieces of
the defining word. Finally, we provide a counterexample to a conjecture by Gray

invertible pieces of a special one-relation inverse monoid.

the first time the emergence of highly degenerate kagome spin configuration for
the basal plane spin component of BFO with concomitant freezing of transverse

in coexistence with the LRO FMI phase. Our results mimic the theoretical

that this work will encourage further experimental studies in search of low

with Reynolds number is found to vary, depending on the Reynolds number
definition used. To compare the present results with those obtained in other

surface-influenced layer. This allows us to probe the two-regime model of

However, the spatial correlation between instantaneous surface divergence and
transfer velocity tends to decrease with increasing Schmidt number and increase
with increasing Reynolds number. The latter is shown to be caused by an
enhancement of the correlation in high-speed regions, which in turn is linked
to the spatial distribution of surface-parallel vortices.

unstable and the number of cutting planes invoked by traditional remedies is
difficult to bound, leading to convergences guarantees that are sublinear
relative to the cumulative number of gradient evaluations. We instead propose a
multipoint generalization of the gradient descent iteration for local

by a ``max-of-smooth'' model that captures the subdifferential dimension at

narrow-band states close to the Fermi level ($E_\mathrm{F}$) at low photon
energies near the zone center, with an emphasis on electronic reconstruction
due to Brillouin zone folding. A substantial challenge to a proper description
is that these states interact with other hole-band states that are generally
absent from bulk-sensitive soft x-ray ARPES measurements. Here we provide a
more global $k$-space context for the presence of such states and their
relation to the bulk Fermi surface topology using synchrotron-based wide-angle
and photon energy-dependent ARPES mapping of the electronic structure using
photon energies intermediate between the low-energy regime and the high-energy
soft x-ray regime. Small-spot spatial dependence, $f$-resonant photoemission,
Si 2$p$ core-levels, x-ray polarization, surface-dosing modification, and
theoretical surface slab calculations are employed to assist identification of
bulk versus surface state character of the $E_\mathrm{F}$-crossing bands and
their relation to specific U- or Si-terminations of the cleaved surface. The
bulk Fermi surface topology is critically compared to density functional theory
and to dynamical mean field theory calculations. In addition to clarifying some
aspects of the previously measured high symmetry $\Gamma$, Z and X points,
incommensurate 0.6a* nested Fermi-edge states located along Z-N-Z are found to
be distinctly different from the density functional theory Fermi surface
prediction. The temperature evolution of these states above $T_{HO}$, combined

Current methods for domain adaptation either assume access to source data
during training, which may not be available due to privacy or memory concerns,
or require a sequence of lidar frames as an input. We propose a single-frame
approach for source-free, unsupervised domain adaptation of lidar-based 3D

noise. Addressing the limitations of traditional feature aggregation methods
for prototype computation in the presence of noisy labels, we utilize a
transformer module to identify outlier ROI's that correspond to incorrect,
over-confident annotations, and compute an attentive class prototype. Under an
iterative training strategy, the losses associated with noisy pseudo labels are
down-weighed and thus refined in the process of self-training. To validate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach, we examine the domain shift associated
with networks trained on large, label-rich datasets (such as the Waymo Open
Dataset and nuScenes) and evaluate on smaller, label-poor datasets (such as
KITTI) and vice-versa. We demonstrate our approach on two recent object

  http://yuval-alaluf.github.io/hyperstyle/",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The inversion of real images into StyleGAN's latent space is a well-studied
problem. Nevertheless, applying existing approaches to real-world scenarios
remains an open challenge, due to an inherent trade-off between reconstruction
and editability: latent space regions which can accurately represent real
images typically suffer from degraded semantic control. Recent work proposes to
mitigate this trade-off by fine-tuning the generator to add the target image to
well-behaved, editable regions of the latent space. While promising, this
fine-tuning scheme is impractical for prevalent use as it requires a lengthy
training phase for each new image. In this work, we introduce this approach
into the realm of encoder-based inversion. We propose HyperStyle, a
hypernetwork that learns to modulate StyleGAN's weights to faithfully express a
given image in editable regions of the latent space. A naive modulation
approach would require training a hypernetwork with over three billion
parameters. Through careful network design, we reduce this to be in line with
existing encoders. HyperStyle yields reconstructions comparable to those of
optimization techniques with the near real-time inference capabilities of
encoders. Lastly, we demonstrate HyperStyle's effectiveness on several
applications beyond the inversion task, including the editing of out-of-domain
images which were never seen during training.

image classification, they are computationally expensive and require many
GFLOPs. Although the GFLOPs of a vision transformer can be decreased by
reducing the number of tokens in the network, there is no setting that is
optimal for all input images. In this work, we therefore introduce a
differentiable parameter-free Adaptive Token Sampler (ATS) module, which can be
plugged into any existing vision transformer architecture. ATS empowers vision
transformers by scoring and adaptively sampling significant tokens. As a
result, the number of tokens is not constant anymore and varies for each input
image. By integrating ATS as an additional layer within the current transformer
blocks, we can convert them into much more efficient vision transformers with
an adaptive number of tokens. Since ATS is a parameter-free module, it can be
added to the off-the-shelf pre-trained vision transformers as a plug and play
module, thus reducing their GFLOPs without any additional training. Moreover,
due to its differentiable design, one can also train a vision transformer
equipped with ATS. We evaluate the efficiency of our module in both image and
video classification tasks by adding it to multiple SOTA vision transformers.
Our proposed module improves the SOTA by reducing their computational costs
(GFLOPs) by 2X, while preserving their accuracy on the ImageNet, Kinetics-400,

vision transformers with a minimal drop of accuracy for image recognition.
Optimized jointly with a transformer backbone in an end-to-end manner, a

disappearance of the QAH order, electronic bands recover two-fold valley
degeneracy, thereby forming a conventional or compensated (with majority and
minority carriers) half-metal at moderate doping, depending on the relative
strength of LP and LAF. At even higher doping and for weak $D$-field only LAF
survives and the Fermi surface recovers four-fold degeneracy. We also show that
a pure repulsive electronic interaction mediated triplet $f$-wave pairing
emerges from a parent correlated nematic liquid or compensated half-metal when
an in-plane magnetic field is applied to the system.

in the level of accuracy in determining the neutron lifetime using an
alternative concept of neutron beta decay. Neutrons are distributed among
different subsets depending on the sign of the scalar product of the neutron
spin vector and momentum of the emitted electron during decay. Therefore, the
neutron lifetime can be determined separately for each of the subsets as the
inverse frequency of its decay, which is to be averaged over the number of
neutrons in this subset. The total neutron lifetime on the total set of
neutrons is calculated by averaging the partial (basic) lifetimes, considering
their weights. The weights of the basic lifetimes are calculated for two
weighing methods, leading, respectively, to the so-called lifetime of
""nonpolarized"" neutrons, the weighted average lifetime of neutrons and the
central lifetime, i.e. the arithmetic mean for the basic lifetimes of neutrons.
The dependence between different average neutron lifetimes through the integral
asymmetry parameter calculated by using known experimental data leads to simple
analytical expressions. The numerical estimate of the weighted average neutron
lifetime gives a value that is in good agreement with the results of well-known
experiments, which proves the validity of the proposed concept of neutron beta
decay. This article includes necessary conditions for a new experiment to bring
the neutron lifetime determination to a new level of accuracy.

show that a standard cold dark matter halo that follows the concentration-halo
mass relation fails to reproduce the amplitude of the rotation curve by a large
margin. Only a halo with an extremely (and arguably unfeasible) low
concentration reaches agreement with the data. We also find that the rotation
curve of AGC 114905 deviates strongly from the predictions of Modified
Newtonian dynamics. The inclination of the galaxy, which is measured
independently from our modelling, remains the largest uncertainty in our
analysis, but the associated errors are not large enough to reconcile the
galaxy with the expectations of cold dark matter or Modified Newtonian
dynamics.

recovering quantum information from subsystems of a thermalized quantum

a large amount of undistillable, bound entanglement in thermalized states. For
evaporating black holes at finite temperature, both the logarithmic negativity
and the Petz map fidelity reveal an important new time scale $t_b$, which is
earlier than the Page time $t_p$ by a finite fraction of the total evaporation

quantum entanglement between different parts of the radiation becomes
extensive, and the fidelity of information recovery for a large diary thrown

Remarkably, our closed string breaking condition has two branches. We argue
that they should correspond to states of opposite parity. The Wilson

requires a critically tuned Kalb-Ramond field in a compact direction, and leads
to a self-contained corner called nonrelativistic string theory. This theory is
unitary, ultraviolet complete, and its string spectrum and spacetime S-matrix

in nonrelativistic string theory necessarily carry nonzero windings. First,
starting with relativistic string theory, we construct a KLT factorization of
amplitudes for winding closed strings in the presence of a critical Kalb-Ramond

not, by itself, evidence for physics beyond GR, our work shows that the
$\textit{sign}$ of the EFE-like correlation between the external field strength

physics: e.g., in MOND, the predicted sign is opposite to that in our

scattering boosts the H$\alpha$ luminosity by $\sim40\%$. The dust correction
via the Balmer decrement works well (intrinsic H$\alpha$ emission recoverable
within $25\%$), though the dust attenuation law depends on the amount of
attenuation itself both on spatially resolved and integrated scales. Important
for the understanding of the H$\alpha$-SFR connection is the dust and helium
absorption of ionizing radiation (Lyman continuum [LyC] photons), which are
about $f_{\rm abs}\approx28\%$ and $f_{\rm He}\approx9\%$, respectively.
Together with an escape fraction of $f_{\rm esc}\approx6\%$, this reduces the
available budget for hydrogen line emission by nearly half ($f_{\rm

among other things - that the extraplanar H$\alpha$ emission is powered by LyC
photons escaping the disc. Future applications of this framework to

Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining

approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods
struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in
sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a
sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and
expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous
superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of
butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we
propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of
modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity
pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most
network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated
Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve
favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and
WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster

Supernova Ia (SnIa) observations. We show that the scenario under study,
although capable to resolve the Hubble tension without worsening the so-called

high-multipole polarization data from both Planck and SPT. Intriguingly, when
trading Planck TE-EE data for those from ACT, we find a $\gtrsim 3 \sigma$
preference for a non-zero sterile neutrino mass, $m_s=3.6^{+1.1}_{-0.6}$ eV (68
% C.L.), compatible with the range suggested by longstanding short-baseline
(SBL) anomalies in neutrino oscillation experiments. The pseudoscalar model
provides indeed a better fit to ACT data compared to $\Lambda$CDM
($\Delta\chi^2 \simeq -5$, $\Delta \rm{AIC}=-1.3$), although in a combined
analysis with Planck the $\Lambda$CDM model is still favoured, as the
preference for a non-zero sterile neutrino mass is mostly driven by ACT
favouring a higher value for the primordial spectral index $n_s$ with respect
to Planck. We show that the mild tension between Planck and ACT is due to the
different pattern in the TE and EE power spectra on multipoles between $350
\lesssim \ell \lesssim 1000$. We also check the impact of marginalizing over
the gravitational lensing information in Planck data, showing that the model
does not solve the CMB lensing anomaly. Future work including higher precision
data from current and upcoming CMB ground-based experiments will be crucial to

theory, with particular emphasis in recent years on control and engineering

Hamiltonian models: the Non-perturbative Analytical Diagonalization (NPAD) and
the Recursive Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation (RSWT). NPAD makes use of the
Jacobi iteration and works without the assumptions of perturbation theory while
retaining convergence, allowing to treat a very wide range of models. In the
perturbation regime, it reduces to RSWT, which takes advantage of an in-built
recursive structure where remarkably the number of terms increases only
linearly with perturbation order, exponentially decreasing the number of terms
compared to the ubiquitous Schrieffer-Wolff method. In this regime, NPAD
further gives an exponential reduction in terms, i.e. superexponential compared
to Schrieffer-Wolff, relevant to high precision expansions. Both methods
consist of algebraic expressions and can be easily automated for symbolic
computation. To demonstrate the application of the methods, we study the ZZ and
cross-resonance interactions of superconducting qubits systems. We investigate
both suppressing and engineering the coupling in near-resonant and
quasi-dispersive regimes. With the proposed methods, the coupling strength in
the effective Hamiltonians can be estimated with high precision comparable to
numerical results.

Mg$_2$SiO$_4$, Fe, Al$_2$O$_3$, and TiO$_2$, can significantly alter optical
albedos, but these clouds are expected to be confined to localized regions in
the atmospheres of these tidally locked planets. Here, we present 3D general
circulation models and corresponding cloud and albedo maps for six hot Jupiters
with measured optical albedos in this temperature range. We find that the
observed optical albedos of K2-31b and K2-107b are best matched by either cloud
free models or models with relatively compact cloud layers, while Kepler-8b and
Kepler-17b's optical albedos can be matched by moderately extended ($f_{sed}$ =
0.1) parametric cloud models. HATS-11b has a high optical albedo, corresponding
to models with bright Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ clouds extending to very low pressures
($f_{sed}$ = 0.03). We are unable to reproduce Kepler-7b's high albedo, as our
models predict that the dayside will be dominated by dark Al$_2$O$_3$ clouds at
most longitudes. We compare our parametric cloud model with a two-zone
microphysical cloud model (\texttt{CARMA}). We find that even after accounting
for the 3D thermal structure, no single cloud model can explain the full range
of observed albedos within the sample. We conclude that a better knowledge of
the vertical mixing profiles, cloud radiative feedback, cloud condensate
properties, and atmospheric metallicities is needed in order to explain the
unexpected diversity of albedos in this temperature range.

attain and remain in a quasi-steady state. Here we prove in generality that
this reduces the coupled system into a single Boltzmann equation of the

closed-form expression for the effective cross-section for an arbitrary number

Excited bound levels may thus decrease the dark matter density more

with shorter orbital periods in the solar system continue to befuddle numerical
accretion models. Recent studies have shown that, if massive embryos (or even
giant planet cores) formed early in the innermost parts of the Sun's gaseous
disk, they would have migrated outward. This migration may have reshaped the
surface density profile of terrestrial planet-forming material and generated
conditions favorable to the formation of Mercury-like planets. Here, we
continue to develop this model with an updated suite of numerical simulations.
We favor a scenario where Earth and Venus' progenitor nuclei form closer to the
Sun and subsequently sculpt the Mercury-forming region by migrating towards
their modern orbits. This rapid formation of ~0.5 Earth-mass cores at ~0.1-0.5
au is consistent with modern high-resolution simulations of planetesimal
accretion. In successful realizations, Earth and Venus accrete mostly dry,
Enstatite Chondrite-like material as they migrate; thus providing a simple
explanation for the masses of all four terrestrial planets, inferred isotopic
differences between Earth and Mars, and Mercury's isolated orbit. Furthermore,
our models predict that Venus' composition should be similar to the Earth's,

Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as revolutionary materials for
electronic DNA sequencing with strong potentials for fast, single-nucleotide
direct-read DNA sequencing with a minimum amount of consumables. Among 2D
materials, graphene is the most explored for DNA sequencing. This is due to its
commercial availability. The major hindrance of graphene is its hydrophobicity,
which causes DNA bases to stick to its surface, slowing down translocation
speed, and making single-base discrimination difficult as multiple bases
interact with graphene at any given time. It is therefore essential that other
elemental 2D materials beyond graphene be investigated. Using density
functional theory (DFT), we studied the electronic interaction of DNA bases
physisorped onto the surface of nanoribbons from graphene, phosphorene, and

NP-complete, many genetic algorithms have been proposed to search optimal

paper, for the first time, we study the transferability of pre-trained models
based on synthetic data generated by graphics simulators to downstream tasks
from very different domains. In using such synthetic data for pre-training, we
find that downstream performance on different tasks are favored by different
configurations of simulation parameters (e.g. lighting, object pose,
backgrounds, etc.), and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It is thus
better to tailor synthetic pre-training data to a specific downstream task, for
best performance. We introduce Task2Sim, a unified model mapping downstream
task representations to optimal simulation parameters to generate synthetic
pre-training data for them. Task2Sim learns this mapping by training to find
the set of best parameters on a set of ""seen"" tasks. Once trained, it can then
be used to predict best simulation parameters for novel ""unseen"" tasks in one
shot, without requiring additional training. Given a budget in number of images
per class, our extensive experiments with 20 diverse downstream tasks show
Task2Sim's task-adaptive pre-training data results in significantly better
downstream performance than non-adaptively choosing simulation parameters on
both seen and unseen tasks. It is even competitive with pre-training on real

actually decay exponentially. Additionally, under the assumption of positive

challenge for the potential clinical application of bnAbs is the suppression of
viral escape, which is more effectively achieved with a combination of bNAbs.
However, identifying an optimal bNAb cocktail is combinatorially complex. Here,
we propose a computational approach to predict the efficacy of a bNAb therapy
trial based on the population genetics of HIV escape, which we parametrize
using high-throughput HIV sequence data from a cohort of untreated bNAb-naive
patients. By quantifying the mutational target size and the fitness cost of
HIV-1 escape from bNAbs, we reliably predict the distribution of rebound times
in three clinical trials. Importantly, we show that early rebounds are
dominated by the pre-treatment standing variation of HIV-1 populations, rather
than spontaneous mutations during treatment. Lastly, we show that a cocktail of
three bNAbs is necessary to suppress the chances of viral escape below 1%, and
we predict the optimal composition of such a bNAb cocktail. Our results offer a
rational design for bNAb therapy against HIV-1, and more generally show how
genetic data could be used to predict treatment outcomes and design new
approaches to pathogenic control.

chosen labels, often in the form of intermediate or multitask supervision.
While intuitive, this idea has proven elusive in practice. We make two
observations about human rationales via empirical analyses: 1) maximizing
rationale supervision accuracy is not necessarily the optimal objective for
improving model accuracy; 2) human rationales vary in whether they provide
sufficient information for the model to exploit for prediction. Building on
these insights, we propose several novel loss functions and learning
strategies, and evaluate their effectiveness on three datasets with human
rationales. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements over baselines in
both label and rationale accuracy, including a 3% accuracy improvement on

corrections in the context of fiber dose measurements, this approach has not
been yet translated into volumetric measurements where cameras are typically
used for their distinguishing spatial resolution. This work investigates
demosaicing algorithms for polychromatic cameras based spectral imaging. The
scintillation and Cherenkov signals produced in a radioluminescent phantom are
imaged by a polychromatic camera and isolated using the spectral formalism. To
do so, five demosaicing algorithms are investigated from calibration to
measurements: a clustering method and four interpolation algorithms. The
resulting accuracy of scintillation and Cherenkov images is evaluated with
measurements of the differences (mean $\pm$ standard deviation) between the
obtained and expected signals from profiles drawn across a scintillation spot.
Signal-to-noise ratio and signal-to-background ratio are further measured and
compared in the resulting scintillation images. Clustering, OpenCV, bilinear,
Malvar and Menon demosaicing algorithms respectively yielded differences of
$3\pm6\%$, $0.1\pm0.5\%$, $0.5\pm0.5\%$, $1\pm3\%$ and $1\pm4\%$ in the
resulting scintillation images. For the Cherenkov images, all algorithms
provided differences below 1\%. All methods enabled measurements over the
detectability (SBR>2) and sensitivity (SNR>5) thresholds with the bilinear
algorithm providing the best SNR value. Hence, radioluminescent signals can
accurately be isolated using a single polychromatic camera. Moreover,
demosaicing using a bilinear kernel provided the best results and enabled stem
effect subtraction while preserving the full spatial resolution of the camera.

of GCs in the Fornax dSph, WLM, NGC 147, NGC 6822, and the Milky Way. The GCs
cover the range -2.8 < [Fe/H] < -0.1 and we determined abundances for Fe, Na,
Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Ba, and Eu. Corrections for non
local thermodynamic equilibrium effects are included for Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Mn,
Fe, Ni, and Ba. For several of the galaxies, our measurements provide the first
quantitative constraints on the detailed composition of their metal-poor
stellar populations. Overall, the GCs in different galaxies exhibit remarkably
uniform abundance patterns of the alpha-, iron-peak, and neutron-capture
elements, with a dispersion of less than 0.1 dex in [alpha/Fe] for the full
sample. There is a hint that GCs in dwarf galaxies are slightly less
alpha-enhanced (by about 0.04 dex on average) than those in larger galaxies.
One GC in M33 (HM33-B) resembles the most metal-rich GCs in the Fornax dSph
(Fornax 4) and NGC 6822 (SC7) by having alpha-element abundances closer to
scaled-solar values, possibly hinting at an accretion origin. We find that the
alpha-element abundances strongly correlate with those of Na, Sc, Ni, and Zn.
Several GCs with [Fe/H]<-1.5 are deficient in Mg compared to other
alpha-elements. We find no GCs with strongly enhanced r-process abundances as
reported for metal-poor stars in some ultra-faint dwarfs and the Magellanic
Clouds. The similarity of the abundance patterns for metal-poor GCs in
different environments points to similar early enrichment histories and only
allow for minor variations in the initial mass function.

luminosity function (IRLF) and 3427 AGN used to construct the X-ray luminosity
function (XLF), providing the largest census of the AGN population out to $z=4$
in both bands with significant reduction in uncertainties. We are able for the
first time to see the knee of the IRLF at $z>2$ and observe a flattening of the
faint-end slope as redshift increases. The bolometric luminosity density, a
proxy for the cosmic black hole accretion history, computed from our LFs shows
a peak at $z\approx2.25$ consistent with recent estimates of the peak in the
star formation rate density (SFRD). However, at earlier epochs, the AGN
luminosity density is flatter than the SFRD. If confirmed, this result suggests
that the build up of black hole mass outpaces the growth of stellar mass in
high mass systems at $z\gtrsim 2.5$. This is consistent with observations of
redshift $z\sim 6$ quasars which lie above the local $M-\sigma$ relationship.
The luminosity density derived from the IRLF is higher than that from the XLF
at all redshifts. This is consistent with the dominant role of obscured AGN
activity in the cosmic growth of supermassive black holes.

We demonstrate our ideas by constructing three new tasks requiring
compositional generalization, an important evaluation setting absent from the

approaches solve the original tasks (>99% accuracy), neither approach succeeded

found that though diversifying training data was far more useful than simply
increasing dataset size, it was still insufficient for driving robust
compositional generalization (with <70% accuracy for complex compositions). Our
results underscore the importance of highly controllable task generators for

simple model of heterogeneous diffusion where the diffusion coefficient $D(x)$
varies in power-law way, i.e. $D(x) \sim |x|^{-\alpha}$ with the exponent
$\alpha >-1$. This model is known to exhibit anomalous scaling of the mean
squared displacement (MSD) of the form $\sim t^{\frac{2}{2+\alpha}}$ and weak
ergodicity breaking in the sense that ensemble averaged and time averaged MSDs
do not converge. In this paper, we look at the extreme value statistics of this

maximum spatial displacement $M(t)$ and arg-maximum $t_m(t)$ (i.e. the time at

paper, we analyze the statistical properties of the residence time $t_r(t)$ and
the last-passage time $t_{\ell}(t)$ and compute their distributions exactly for
all values of $\alpha$. Our study unravels that the heterogeneous version

the distributions of $t_m(t),~t_r(t)$ and $t_{\ell}(t)$ are all identical

backgrounds for $\mathcal{O}(10)~$MeV neutrino interactions in water Cherenkov
detectors. In particular, it is crucial to reduce backgrounds to measure the
solar neutrino spectrum and find neutrino interactions from distant supernovae.
In this paper we introduce new techniques to locate muon-induced hadronic
showers and efficiently reject spallation backgrounds. Applying these
techniques to the solar neutrino analysis with an exposure of
$2790\times22.5$~kton.day increases the signal efficiency by $12.6\%$,
approximately corresponding to an additional year of detector running.
Furthermore, we present the first spallation simulation at SK, where we model
hadronic interactions using FLUKA. The agreement between the isotope yields and
shower pattern in this simulation and in the data gives confidence in the
accuracy of this simulation, and thus opens the door to use it to optimize muon
spallation removal in new data with gadolinium-enhanced neutron capture
detection.

different beam-target strategies were introduced being potential candidates for
maximum coupling. Two dispersion-tuned beam ensembles with strongly
frequency-dependent phase center location have been created with a fixed
incident beam 1/e radius and radius of curvature called forward strategies.
These computations of different alignments were continued with four beam
ensembles of frequency-invariant phase center, constructed from fits to
experimental data, oriented at four different axial locations with respect to
the spherical shell center of curvature, they are called reverse strategies.
Coupling efficiency for all strategies was calculated for different targets
including PEC sphere, air-core, and PEC core covered by a cornea loss-free
layer and cornea. All scattering strategies contrasted to scattering from
equivalent planar targets as a reference with maximum coupling. The results
show that, under an ideal calibration, forward strategies are a closer
approximation to the plane-wave condition. However, target properties influence
the coupling efficiency remarkably for instance the observed difference in
cornea scattering is vanishingly small as dielectric loss limits walk-off loss.
Furthermore, under perturbed calibration, the forward strategies showed less

present a new graph streaming model: XStream. We maintain a streaming graph and
its connected components at single-edge granularity. In cybersecurity graph
applications, input streams typically consist of edge insertions; individual
deletions are not explicit. Analysts maintain as much history as possible and
will trigger customized bulk deletions when necessary Despite a variety of
dynamic graph processing systems and some canonical literature on theoretical
sliding-window graph streaming, XStream is the first model explicitly designed
to accommodate this usage model. Users can provide Boolean predicates to define
bulk deletions. Edge arrivals are expected to occur continuously and must
always be handled. XStream is implemented via a ring of finite-memory
processors. We give algorithms to maintain connected components on the input
stream, answer queries about connectivity, and to perform bulk deletion. The
system requires bandwidth for internal messages that is some constant factor
greater than the stream arrival rate. We prove a relationship among four
quantities: the proportion of query downtime allowed, the proportion of edges
that survive an aging event, the proportion of duplicated edges, and the
bandwidth expansion factor. In addition to presenting the theory behind
XStream, we present computational results for a single-threaded prototype
implementation. Stream ingestion rates are bounded by computer architecture. We
determine this bound for XStream inter-process message-passing rates in Intel
TBB applications on Intel Sky Lake processors: between one and five million
graph edges per second. Our single-threaded prototype runs our full protocols
through multiple aging events at between one half and one a million edges per
second, and we give ideas for speeding this up by orders of magnitude.

Hence, it is crucial to limit adoption to those most worthwhile; yet no

evaluate several SOAR tools using specific criteria pertaining to their

tool aspects are most important. Operators were then assigned a set of SOAR
tools for which they viewed demonstration and overview videos, and then
operators completed a second survey wherein they were tasked with evaluating
each of the tools on the aspects from the first survey. In addition, operators
provided an overall rating to each of their assigned tools, and provided a
ranking of their tools in order of preference. Due to time constraints on SOC
operators for thorough testing, we provide a systematic method of downselecting
a large pool of SOAR tools to a select few that merit next-step hands-on
evaluation by SOC operators. Furthermore, the analyses conducted in this survey
help to inform future development of SOAR tools to ensure that the appropriate

account for the possibility of nodes having oscillatory dynamics such as in
power grids and brain networks. Here we consider a network of Kuramoto
oscillators upon which the BTW model is unfolding, enabling us to study how the
feedback between the oscillatory and cascading dynamics can lead to new
emergent behaviors. We assume that the more out-of-sync a node is with its
neighbors the more vulnerable it is and lower its load-carrying capacity
accordingly. And when a node topples and sheds load, its oscillatory phase is
reset at random. This leads to novel cyclic behavior at an emergent, long
timescale. The system spends the bulk of its time in a synchronized state where
load builds up with minimal cascades. Yet, eventually the system reaches a
tipping point where a large cascade triggers a ""cascade of larger cascades,""
which can be classified as a Dragon King event. The system then undergoes a
short transient back to the synchronous, build-up phase. The coupling between
capacity and synchronization gives rise to endogenous cascade seeds in addition
to the standard exogenous ones, and we show their respective roles. We
establish the phenomena from numerical studies and develop the accompanying
mean-field theory to locate the tipping point, calculate the load in the
system, determine the frequency of the long-time oscillations and find the
distribution of cascade sizes during the build-up phase.

algorithmic framework. The said algorithm solves non-convex optimal control
problems with specific types of state constraints (i.e. union of convex
keep-out zones) and is faster to converge than SCvx, its predecessor. In order
to preserve more feasibility, the proposed algorithm uses a novel project-and
convexify procedure to successively convexify both state constraints and system
dynamics, and thus a finite dimensional convex programming subproblem is solved
at each succession. It also gets rid of the dependency on trust regions,
gaining the ability to take larger steps and thus ultimately attaining faster
convergence. The extension is in three folds as follows. i) We can now
initialize the algorithm from an infeasible starting point, and regain
feasibility in just one step; ii) We get rid of the smoothness conditions on
the constraints so that a broader range of ""obstacles"" can be included.
Significant changes are made to adjust the algorithm accordingly; iii) We
obtain a proof of superlinear rate of convergence, a new theoretical result for
SCvx-fast. Benefiting from its specific problem setup and the project-and
convexify procedure, the SCvx-fast algorithm is particularly suitable for
solving trajectory planning problems with collision avoidance constraints.
Numerical simulations are performed, affirming the fast convergence rate. With

afterglow emission of a gamma-ray burst, we revisit predictions of the maximum
energy to which electrons can be accelerated at a relativistic blast wave.
Acceleration at the weakly-magnetized forward shock of a blast-wave can be
limited either by the rapid damping of turbulence generated behind the shock,
by the effect of a large-scale ambient magnetic field, or by radiation losses.
Within the confines of a standard, single zone, synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC)
model, we show that observations of GRB190829A rule out a rapid damping of the
downstream turbulence. Furthermore, simultaneous fits to the X-ray and TeV
gamma-ray emission of this object are not possible unless the limit on
acceleration imposed by the ambient magnetic field is comparable or weaker than
that imposed by radiation losses. This requires the dominant length scale of
the turbulence behind the shock to be larger than that implied by
particle-in-cell simulations. However, even then, Klein-Nishina effects prevent
production of the hard VHE gamma-ray spectrum suggested by observations. Thus,
TeV observations of GRB afterglows, though still very sparse, are already in
tension with the SSC emission scenario.

achieved transfer learning results comparable to models pre-trained on natural

milestone is to develop a control system that is versatile enough to handle any

control system must adhere to the International Regulations for Preventing
Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) for successful interaction with human sailors.
Since the COLREGs were written for the human mind to interpret, they are

we study a sparsely connected attractor network where memories are learned
according to a Hebbian synaptic plasticity rule. After recapitulating known
results for the continuous, sparsely connected Hopfield model, we investigate a
model in which new memories are learned continuously and old memories are
forgotten, using an online synaptic plasticity rule. We show that for a
forgetting time scale that optimizes storage capacity, the qualitative features
of the network's memory retrieval dynamics are age-dependent: most recent
memories are retrieved as fixed-point attractors while older memories are
retrieved as chaotic attractors characterized by strong heterogeneity and
temporal fluctuations. Therefore, fixed-point and chaotic attractors co-exist
in the network phase space. The network presents a continuum of statistically
distinguishable memory states, where chaotic fluctuations appear abruptly above
a critical age and then increase gradually until the memory disappears. We
develop a dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) to analyze the age-dependent
dynamics and compare the theory with simulations of large networks. Our
numerical simulations show that a high-degree of sparsity is necessary for the
DMFT to accurately predict the network capacity. Finally, our theory provides
specific predictions for delay response tasks with aging memoranda. Our theory
of attractor networks that continuously learn new information at the price of
forgetting old memories can account for the observed diversity of retrieval

new model gives a very good reproduction of the locus of star-forming galaxies
on standard line ratio diagnostic diagrams. The new model shows evolution in
the locus of star forming galaxies with redshift on this line ratio diagram,
with a good match to the observed line ratios at $z=1.6$. The model galaxies at
high redshift have gas densities and ionisation parameters that are predicted
to be $\approx 2-3$ times higher than in local star forming galaxies, which is
partly driven by the changing selection with redshift to mimic the
observational selection. Our results suggest that the observed evolution in
emission line ratios requires other HII region properties to evolve with
redshift, such as the gas density, and cannot be reproduced by HII model grids
that only allow the gas metallicity and ionisation parameter to vary.

Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) frameworks, Atos exposes additional concurrency
by supporting task-parallel formulations of applications with relaxed

significant for problems with concurrency bottlenecks. Atos also offers
implicit task-parallel load balancing in addition to data-parallel load
balancing, providing users the flexibility to balance between them to achieve
optimal performance. Finally, Atos allows users to adapt to different use cases
by controlling the kernel strategy and task-parallel granularity. We
demonstrate that each of these controls is important in practice. We evaluate
and analyze the performance of Atos vs. BSP on three applications:
breadth-first search, PageRank, and graph coloring. Atos implementations
achieve geomean speedups of 3.44x, 2.1x, and 2.77x and peak speedups of 12.8x,
3.2x, and 9.08x across three case studies, compared to a state-of-the-art BSP

analyze the reasons behind each speedup. This deeper understanding allows us to
derive general guidelines for how to select the optimal Atos configuration for
different applications. Finally, our analysis provides insights for future

binary convolution block which improves quality of BNNs by techniques such as
adding multiple residual paths, and tuning the activation function. We apply it
to ResNet-50 and optimize ResNet's initial convolutional layer which is hard to
binarize. We name the resulting network family PokeBNN. These techniques are
chosen to yield favorable improvements in both top-1 accuracy and the network's

we define arithmetic computation effort (ACE), a hardware- and energy-inspired
cost metric for quantized and binarized networks. We also identify a need to
optimize an under-explored hyper-parameter controlling the binarization
gradient approximation.
  We establish a new, strong state-of-the-art (SOTA) on top-1 accuracy together

hyperfine splitting (HFS) in muonic hydrogen ($\mu$p) with 1 ppm accuracy by
means of pulsed laser spectroscopy to determine the two-photon-exchange
contribution with $2\times10^{-4}$ relative accuracy. In the proposed
experiment, the $\mu$p atom undergoes a laser excitation from the singlet
hyperfine state to the triplet hyperfine state, {then} is quenched back to the
singlet state by an inelastic collision with a H$_2$ molecule. The resulting
increase of kinetic energy after the collisional deexcitation is used as a
signature of a successful laser transition between hyperfine states. In this
paper, we calculate the combined probability that a $\mu$p atom initially in
the singlet hyperfine state undergoes a laser excitation to the triplet state
followed by a collisional-induced deexcitation back to the singlet state. This
combined probability has been computed using the optical Bloch equations
including the inelastic and elastic collisions. Omitting the decoherence
effects caused by {the laser bandwidth and }collisions would overestimate the
transition probability by more than a factor of two in the experimental
conditions. Moreover, we also account for Doppler effects and provide the
matrix element, the saturation fluence, the elastic and inelastic collision
rates for the singlet and triplet states, and the resonance linewidth. This
calculation thus quantifies one of the key unknowns of the HFS experiment,
leading to a precise definition of the requirements for the laser system and to
an optimization of the hydrogen gas target where $\mu$p is formed and the laser
spectroscopy will occur.

has led to the suggestion that volcanism was the source of phosphine, through
volcanic phosphides ejected into the clouds. Here we examine the idea that
mantle plume volcanism, bringing material from the deep mantle to the surface,
could generate observed amounts of phosphine through interaction of explosively
erupted phosphide with sulfuric acid clouds. Direct eruption of deep mantle
phosphide is unphysical, but shallower material could contain traces of
phosphide, and could be erupted to the surface. Explosive eruption that
efficiently transported material to the clouds would require ocean:magma
interactions or subduction of hydrated oceanic crust, neither of which occur on
modern Venus. The transport of erupted material to altitudes coinciding with
the observations of phosphine is consequently very inefficient. Using the model
proposed by Truong and Lunine as a base case, we estimate that an eruption
volume of at least 21,600 km3/year would be required to explain the presence of
1 ppb phosphine in the clouds. This is greater than any historical terrestrial
eruption rate, and would have several detectable consequences for remote and in
situ observations to confirm. More realistic lithospheric mineralogy, volcano
mechanics or atmospheric photochemistry require even more volcanism.

defining and solving them on Husimi lattices built with diagonal and regular
square lattice clusters of effective lateral size $L$, where $L$ defines the
level of approximation to the square lattice. Due to an $L$-parity effect, by
increasing $L$ we obtain two systematic sequences of values for the entropies
$s_L(k)$ for each type of cluster, whose extrapolations to $L \rightarrow
\infty$ provide estimates of these entropies for the square lattice. For
dimers, our estimates for $s(2)$ differ from the exact result by only $0.03\%$,
while that for $s(3)$ differs from best available estimates by $3\%$. In this
paper, we also obtain a new estimate for $s(4)$. For larger $k$, we find that
the extrapolated results from the Husimi tree calculations do not lie between
the lower and upper bounds established in the literature for $s(k)$. In fact,
we observe that, to obtain reliable estimates for these entropies, we should
deal with levels $L$ that increase with $k$. However, it is very challenging
computationally to advance to solve the problem for large values of $L$ and for
large rods. In addition, the exact calculations on the generalized Husimi trees
provide strong evidence for the fully packed phase to be disordered for $k\geq
4$, in contrast to the results for the Bethe lattice wherein it is nematic,
thus providing evidence for a high density nematic-disordered transition in the

obstructions; these sets are often unknown, or known but infinite. By allowing
extra structure it is sometimes possible to describe such properties by a

extra structure is a linear ordering of the vertex set. For instance, it is
known that a graph G is $k$-colourable if and only if $V(G)$ admits a linear
ordering $\le$ with no vertices $v_1 \le \cdots \le v_{k+1}$ such that $v_i

which describes the limits of several models of random constrained
permutations. This family is parametrized by two real parameters.
  For a specific choice of the parameters, the skew Brownian permuton coincides
with the Baxter permuton, i.e., the permuton limit of Baxter permutations. We
prove that for another specific choice of the parameters, the skew Brownian
permuton coincides with the biased Brownian separable permuton, a one-parameter
family of permutons previously studied in the literature as the limit of
uniform permutations in substitution-closed classes. This brings two different
limiting objects under the same roof, identifying a new larger universality
class.
  The skew Brownian permuton is constructed in terms of flows of solutions of
certain stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by two-dimensional
correlated Brownian excursions in the non-negative quadrant. We call these SDEs
skew perturbed Tanaka equations because they are a mixture of the perturbed
Tanaka equations and the equations encoding skew Brownian motions. We prove
existence and uniqueness of (strong) solutions for these new SDEs.
  In addition, we show that some natural permutons arising from Liouville
quantum gravity spheres decorated with two Schramm-Loewner evolution curves are
skew Brownian permutons and such permutons cover almost the whole range of
possible parameters. Some connections between constrained permutations and
decorated planar maps have been investigated in the literature at the discrete
level; this paper establishes this connection directly at the continuum level.
Proving the latter result, we also give an SDE interpretation of some
quantities related to SLE-decorated Liouville quantum gravity spheres.

resonance frequencies (or eigenfrequencies), which can be tuned by varying the
system's parameters. The relationship between control parameters and the
eigenfrequency spectrum is central to a range of applications. However,
fundamental aspects of this relationship remain poorly understood. For example,
if the controls are varied along a path that returns to its starting point
(i.e., around a ""loop""), the system's spectrum must return to itself. In
systems that are Hermitian (i.e., lossless and reciprocal) this process is
trivial, and each resonance frequency returns to its original value. However,
in non-Hermitian systems, where the eigenfrequencies are complex, the spectrum
may return to itself in a topologically non-trivial manner, a phenomenon known
as spectral flow. The spectral flow is determined by how the control loop
encircles degeneracies, and this relationship is well understood for $N=2$
(where $N$ is the number of oscillators in the system). Here we extend this
description to arbitrary $N$. We show that control loops generically produce
braids of eigenfrequencies, and for $N>2$ these braids form a non-Abelian group
which reflects the non-trivial geometry of the space of degeneracies. We
demonstrate these features experimentally for $N=3$ using a cavity
optomechanical system.

frameworks often address only specific components of argument search and do not
address the following aspects: (1) argument-query matching: identifying
arguments that frame the topic slightly differently than the actual search
query; (2) argument identification: identifying arguments that consist of

topical aspects. In this paper, we propose a framework for addressing these
shortcomings. We suggest (1) to combine the keyword search with precomputed
topic clusters for argument-query matching, (2) to apply a novel approach based
on sentence-level sequence-labeling for argument identification, and (3) to
present aggregated arguments to users based on topic-aware argument clustering.
Our experiments on several real-world debate data sets demonstrate that
density-based clustering algorithms, such as HDBSCAN, are particularly suitable
for argument-query matching. With our sentence-level, BiLSTM-based

evaluating our argument clustering method indicates that a fine-grained

we systematically analyze the effects of rounded corner radii on the

multi-robot systems in the scenario of sampled communication. The goal is to
make a group of robots perform trajectory tracking in a coordinated way when
the sampling time of communications is much larger than the sampling time of
low-level controllers, disrupting theoretical convergence guarantees of
standard control design in continuous time. Given a desired trajectory in
configuration space which is precomputed offline, the proposed controller
receives configuration measurements, possibly via wireless, to re-compute
velocity references for the robots, which are tracked by a low-level
controller. We propose joint design of a sampled proportional feedback plus a
novel continuous-time feedforward that linearizes the dynamics around the
reference trajectory: this method is amenable to distributed communication
implementation where only one broadcast transmission is needed per sample.
Also, we provide closed-form expressions for instability and stability regions
and convergence rate in terms of proportional gain $k$ and sampling period $T$.
We test the proposed control strategy via numerical simulations in the scenario
of cooperative aerial manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a realistic
simulator (Fly-Crane). Finally, we compare our proposed controller with
centralized approaches that adapt the feedback gain online through smart
heuristics, and show that it achieves comparable performance.

variety of domains like autonomous vehicles, biomedical imaging, etc. It is
known that their success depends on a large amount of data from the domain of
interest. While deep models often perform well in terms of overall accuracy,
they often struggle in performance on rare yet critical data slices. For
example, data slices like ""motorcycle at night"" or ""bicycle at night"" are often
rare but very critical slices for self-driving applications and false negatives
on such rare slices could result in ill-fated failures and accidents. Active
learning (AL) is a well-known paradigm to incrementally and adaptively build
training datasets with a human in the loop. However, current AL based
acquisition functions are not well-equipped to tackle real-world datasets with
rare slices, since they are based on uncertainty scores or global descriptors
of the image. We propose TALISMAN, a novel framework for Targeted Active

iNformation. Our method uses the submodular mutual information functions
instantiated using features of the region of interest (RoI) to efficiently
target and acquire data points with rare slices. We evaluate our framework on
the standard PASCAL VOC07+12 and BDD100K, a real-world self-driving dataset. We
observe that TALISMAN outperforms other methods by in terms of average
precision on rare slices, and in terms of mAP.

paper, we rethink the eventbased image deblurring problem and unfold it into an
end-to-end two-stage image restoration network. To effectively fuse event and
image features, we design an event-image cross-modal attention module applied
at multiple levels of our network, which allows to focus on relevant features
from the event branch and filter out noise. We also introduce a novel symmetric
cumulative event representation specifically for image deblurring as well as an
event mask gated connection between the two stages of our network which helps
avoid information loss. At the dataset level, to foster event-based motion
deblurring and to facilitate evaluation on challenging real-world images, we
introduce the Real Event Blur (REBlur) dataset, captured with an event camera

one of the key challenges in the evaluation of exposure effects in
observational studies, and has been the subject of vigorous recent activity in
causal inference. A major drawback of routine procedures is that there is no
finite sample size at which they are guaranteed to deliver exposure effect
estimators and associated confidence intervals with adequate performance. In
this work, we will consider this problem when inferring conditional causal
hazard ratios from observational studies under the assumption of no unmeasured
confounding. The major complication that we face with survival data is that the
key confounding variables may not be those that explain the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we overcome this problem using a novel and simple
procedure that can be implemented using off-the-shelf software for penalized
Cox regression. In particular, we will propose tests of the null hypothesis
that the exposure has no effect on the considered survival endpoint, which are
uniformly valid under standard sparsity conditions. Simulation results show
that the proposed methods yield valid inferences even when covariates are
high-dimensional.

abundances of Na, Mg, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Sr by the line-by-line
analysis based on model atmospheres, with typical errors ranging from 0.2 dex
for [Fe/H] to 0.3-0.4 dex for other [X/H]. We measure radial velocities from
the spectra and combine them with Gaia astrometry to calculate the
Galactocentric space velocities UVW. The resulting [Fe/H] values agree with
previous estimates based on medium-resolution K-band spectroscopy, showing a
wide distribution of metallicity (-0.6 < [Fe/H] < +0.4). The abundance ratios
of individual elements [X/Fe] are generally aligned with the solar values in
all targets. While the [X/Fe] distributions are comparable to those of nearby
FGK stars, most of which belong to the thin disk population, the most
metal-poor object, GJ 699, could be a thick disk star. The UVW velocities also
support this. The results raise the prospect that near-infrared spectra of M

network science, and one which has attracted a significant amount of attention
over the past decades. This area deals with the automated division of a network
into fundamental building blocks, with the objective of providing a summary of
its large-scale structure. Despite its importance and widespread adoption,
there is a noticeable gap between what is arguably the state-of-the-art and the
methods that are actually used in practice in a variety of fields. Here we
attempt to address this discrepancy by dividing existing methods according to
whether they have a ""descriptive"" or an ""inferential"" goal. While descriptive
methods find patterns in networks based on context-dependent notions of
community structure, inferential methods articulate generative models, and
attempt to fit them to data. In this way, they are able to provide insights
into the mechanisms of network formation, and separate structure from
randomness in a manner supported by statistical evidence. We review how
employing descriptive methods with inferential aims is riddled with pitfalls
and misleading answers, and thus should be in general avoided. We argue that
inferential methods are more typically aligned with clearer scientific
questions, yield more robust results, and should be in many cases preferred. We
attempt to dispel some myths and half-truths often believed when community

wave spectral components caused by a spatially graded array of resonators.
Although mainly studied in optics and acoustics, this phenomenon has recently
been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally for water waves
travelling through an array of vertical cylinders. Linear water wave scattering
by a array of vertical, surface-piercing barriers is considered here, in which
both the submergence and spacing between the barriers are spatially graded. The
rainbow reflection effect arises naturally as wave energy temporarily becomes
amplified at different locations depending on frequency. Band diagram
calculations are used to demonstrate that this is a consequence of the wave
gradually slowing down throughout the array. The wave/barriers scattering
problem is then augmented by positioning heave-restricted, rectangular floating
bodies equipped with a linear damping mechanism between each adjacent pair of
barrier. A solution to the resulting boundary-value problem is obtained using
an integral equation/Galerkin method. Using constrained optimisation, passive
rainbow absorbers are designed that achieve near-perfect absorption over (i) a
discrete set of frequencies, and (ii) over an octave. This suggests potential
applications of rainbow absorbers in the design of smart coastal technologies.

quantum dots, these nanoparticles luminesce even when defects are present, and
their emission wavelength is tuned by varying the relative composition. Past

In this work, we investigate the physics of this defect-assisted transition by
systematically varying the concentration of defects through a simple quick-cool

GENETIS algorithm evolves antenna designs using simulated neutrino sensitivity
as a measure of fitness by integrating with XFdtd, a finite difference time

customized version of the Buckshot algorithm, which first applies a
hierarchical clustering procedure on a sample of the input dataset and then it
uses the results as the initial centers for a K-Means based assignment of the
rest of the documents, with very few iterations. We also give highly efficient
adaptations of the proposed techniques in the MapReduce model which are then
experimentally tested using Apache Hadoop and Spark over a real cluster

Furthermore, unlike existing volumetric MVS techniques, our 3D CNN operates on
a feature-augmented point cloud, allowing for effective aggregation of

Experimental results show our method exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy in both

fundamental question remains: are AV failure scenarios identified in simulation
meaningful in reality, i.e., are they reproducible on the real system? Due to
the sim-to-real gap arising from discrepancies between simulated and real
sensor data, a failure scenario identified in simulation can be either a
spurious artifact of the synthetic sensor data or an actual failure that
persists with real sensor data. An approach to validate simulated failure
scenarios is to identify instances of the scenario in a corpus of real data,
and check if the failure persists on the real data. To this end, we propose a
formal definition of what it means for a labelled data item to match an
abstract scenario, encoded as a scenario program using the SCENIC probabilistic

which, given a scenario program and a labelled dataset, finds the subset of
data matching the scenario. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is
accurate and efficient on a variety of realistic traffic scenarios, and scales

substorms that intensify auroral electrojet currents. These currents enhance

geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) that can be detrimental to power
transmission infrastructure. We perform a comparative study of d$B$/d$t$
variations in response to two similarly strong shocks, but with one being
nearly frontal, and the other, highly inclined. Multi-instrument analyses by
the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms
(THEMIS) and Los Alamos National Laboratory spacecraft show that nightside
substorm-time energetic particle injections are more intense and occur faster
in the case of the nearly head-on impact. The same trend is observed in
d$B$/d$t$ variations recorded by THEMIS ground magnetometers. THEMIS all-sky
imager data show a fast and clear poleward auroral expansion in the first case,
which does not clearly occur in the second case. Strong field-aligned currents
computed with the spherical elementary current system (SECS) technique occur in
both cases, but the current variations resulting from the inclined shock impact
are weaker and slower compared to the nearly frontal case. SECS analyses also
reveal that geographic areas with d$B$/d$t$ surpassing the thresholds 1.5 and 5
nT/s, usually linked to high-risk GICs, are larger and occur earlier due to the
symmetric compression caused by the nearly head-on impact. These results, with
profound space weather implications, suggest that shock impact angles affect
the geospace driving conditions and the location and intensity of the
subsequent d$B$/d$t$ variations during substorm activity.

image is a geometrically ill-posed problem. For example, we can not measure the
exact distance of a person to the camera from a single view image without
additional scene assumptions (e.g., known height). Existing learning based
approaches circumvent this issue by reconstructing the 3D pose up to scale.
However, there are many applications such as virtual telepresence, robotics,
and augmented reality that require metric scale reconstruction. In this paper,
we show that audio signals recorded along with an image, provide complementary
information to reconstruct the metric 3D pose of the person.
  The key insight is that as the audio signals traverse across the 3D space,
their interactions with the body provide metric information about the body's
pose. Based on this insight, we introduce a time-invariant transfer function
called pose kernel -- the impulse response of audio signals induced by the body
pose. The main properties of the pose kernel are that (1) its envelope highly
correlates with 3D pose, (2) the time response corresponds to arrival time,
indicating the metric distance to the microphone, and (3) it is invariant to
changes in the scene geometry configurations. Therefore, it is readily
generalizable to unseen scenes. We design a multi-stage 3D CNN that fuses audio
and visual signals and learns to reconstruct 3D pose in a metric scale. We show
that our multi-modal method produces accurate metric reconstruction in real
world scenes, which is not possible with state-of-the-art lifting approaches
including parametric mesh regression and depth regression.

as a machine learning problem using the framework of PINN. A feedforward neural
network with two individual loss groups are constructed to encode the initial
condition and state transitions governed by ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) in MSS. Next, we tackle the problem of high imbalance in the magnitude
of the back-propagated gradients in PINN from a multi-task learning
perspective. Particularly, we treat each element in the loss function as an
individual task, and adopt a gradient surgery approach named projecting
conflicting gradients (PCGrad), where a task's gradient is projected onto the
norm plane of any other task that has a conflicting gradient. The gradient
projection operation significantly mitigates the detrimental effects caused by
the gradient interference when training PINN, thus accelerating the convergence
speed of PINN to high-precision solutions to MSS reliability assessment. With
the proposed PINN-based framework, we investigate its applications for MSS
reliability assessment in several different contexts in terms of
time-independent or dependent state transitions and system scales varying from
small to medium. The results demonstrate that the proposed PINN-based framework
shows generic and remarkable performance in MSS reliability assessment, and the
incorporation of PCGrad in PINN leads to substantial improvement in solution

size are derived and are shown to depend on the convexity of the objective
function, revealing a relation between improper choices of learning rate and
explosion in GANs training. Finally, empirical studies demonstrate that
training algorithms incorporating this adaptive control approach outperform the
standard ADAM method in terms of convergence and robustness.
  From GANs training perspective, the analysis in this paper provides
analytical support for the popular practice of ``clipping'', and suggests that
the convexity and well-posedness issues in GANs may be tackled through
appropriate choices of hyper-parameters.

double diffusive convection (DDC) flows in the diffusive regime subjected to an
imposed shear. The flow is confined between two horizontal plates which are
maintained at different constant temperature, salinity, and different velocity,
thus setting up a shear across the flow. The lower plate is fixed at higher
temperature and salinity, while the overall (unperturbed) density gradient is
statically stable. For a wide range of control parameters, and for sufficiently
strong perturbation of the conductive initial state, we find that
staircase-like structures spontaneously develop, with relatively well-mixed
layers separated by sharp interfaces of enhanced scalar gradient. Such
staircases appear to be robust even in the presence of strong shear over very
long times, although we typically observe early time coarsening of the number
of observed layers. For the same set of control parameters, different
asymptotic layered states, with markedly different vertical scalar fluxes, can
arise for different initial perturbation structures. The imposed shear does
significantly spatio-temporally modify the vertical transport of the various
scalars. The flux ratio (i.e., the ratio between the density fluxes due to the
total (convective and diffusive) salt flux and the total heat flux) is found,
at steady state, to be essentially equal to the square root of the ratio of the
salt diffusivity to the thermal diffusivity, consistently with the physical
model originally proposed by Linden and Shirtcliffe (1978) and the variational
arguments presented by Stern (1982) for unsheared double diffusive convection.

to $\sim5R_{200}$ from the cluster centre. We find a sharp decrease in the

$\sim1.5R_{200}$ from the cluster centre from $\sim0.85\%$ to $\sim0.35\%$. We
see evidence for the environment removing gas from the outskirts of HI-detected
cluster and infall galaxies through the decrease in the HI to $r$-band optical
disc diameter ratio. These galaxies lie on the star forming main sequence,
indicating that gas removal is not yet affecting the inner star-forming discs
and is limited to the galaxy outskirts. Although we do not detect galaxies
undergoing galaxy-wide quenching, we do observe a reduction in recent star
formation in the outer disc of cluster galaxies, which is likely due to the
smaller gas reservoirs present beyond the optical radius in these galaxies.
Stacking of HI non-detections with HI masses below
$M_{\rm{HI}}\lesssim10^{8.4}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$ will be required to probe the HI
of galaxies undergoing quenching at distances $\gtrsim60$ Mpc with WALLABY.

that RP can still reveal more information, showing how RP itself can capture an
important part of the restrictions imposed by the full CS equality. In order to
do that, we use a connection used by us in a previous work between RP and
positive definiteness of a function of a single variable. This allows to write
constraints on the OPE coefficients in a concise way, encoding in the
conditions that certain functions of the crossratio will be positive defined

Vertical, open-bore MRI systems have a 90{\deg} rotated magnet and generate a

about the RF heating of deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems in this class of
scanners. Here, we investigated whether RF heating of DBS devices was
significantly different in a vertical, open-bore MRI scanner compared to a
horizontal, closed-bore MRI scanner. Materials and Methods In this phantom
study, RF heating around the lead of a commercial DBS system implanted in an
anthropomorphic phantom was evaluated in a 1.2 T vertical open-bore scanner
(Oasis, Fujifilm Healthcare) and a 1.5 T horizontal closed-bore scanner (Aera,
Siemens Healthineers). DBS devices were implanted following 30 realistic lead
trajectories. Electromagnetic simulations were performed to assess the specific
absorption rate (SAR) of RF energy around leads with different internal
structures. Results When controlling for B1+rms, temperature increase around
the lead-tip was significantly lower at the vertical scanner compared to the
horizontal scanner (p-value=9.1x10-7). Electromagnetic simulations demonstrated
up to a 14-fold reduction in the maximum 0.1g-averaged SAR deposited in the
tissue surrounding the lead-tip in a vertical scanner compared to a horizontal
scanner for leads with straight and helical internal wires. Conclusions RF
experiments and electromagnetic simulations demonstrated consistently lower RF

Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO), a future Japanese space

curvature at $z\sim 5$. In the framework of the well-known distance sum rule,
the perfect redshift coverage of the standard sirens observed by DECIGO,
compared with lensing observations including the source and lens from LSST,
makes such cosmological-model-independent test more natural and general.
Focusing on three kinds of spherically symmetric mass distributions for the
lensing galaxies, we find that the cosmic curvature is expected to be
constrained with the precision of $\Delta \Omega_K \sim 10^{-2}$ in the early
universe ($z\sim5.0$), improving the sensitivity of ET constraints by about a
factor of 10. However, in order to investigate this further, the mass density
profiles of early-type galaxies should be properly taken into account.
Specially, our analysis demonstrates the strong degeneracy between the spatial
curvature and the lens parameters, especially the redshift evolution of
power-law lens index parameter. When the extended power law mass density
profile is assumed, the weakest constraint on the cosmic curvature can be
obtained. Whereas, the addition of DECIGO to the combination of LSST+DECIGO
does improve the constraint on the luminosity density slope and the anisotropy
of the stellar velocity dispersion significantly. Therefore, our paper
highlights the benefits of synergies between DECIGO and LSST in constraining
new physics beyond the standard model, which could manifest itself through
accurate determination of the cosmic curvature.

identifying categorical labels of graphs. However, most existing graph
classification problems with GNNs follow the protocol of balanced data
splitting, which misaligns with many real-world scenarios in which some classes
have much fewer labels than others. Directly training GNNs under this
imbalanced scenario may lead to uninformative representations of graphs in
minority classes, and compromise the overall classification performance, which
signifies the importance of developing effective GNNs towards handling
imbalanced graph classification. Existing methods are either tailored for
non-graph structured data or designed specifically for imbalanced node
classification while few focus on imbalanced graph classification. To this end,
we introduce a novel framework, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks (G$^2$GNN),
which alleviates the graph imbalance issue by deriving extra supervision
globally from neighboring graphs and locally from stochastic augmentations of
graphs. Globally, we construct a graph of graphs (GoG) based on kernel
similarity and perform GoG propagation to aggregate neighboring graph
representations. Locally, we employ topological augmentation via masking node
features or dropping edges with self-consistency regularization to generate
stochastic augmentations of each graph that improve the model generalibility.

high-throughput screening of materials, the data-centric approach to materials
design has asserted itself as a robust and powerful tool for the in-silico
prediction of materials properties. When training models to predict material
properties, researchers often face a difficult choice between a model's
interpretability or its performance. We study this trade-off by leveraging four
different state-of-the-art ML techniques: XGBoost, SISSO, Roost, and TPOT for
the prediction of structural and electronic properties of perovskites and 2D
materials. We then assess the future outlook of the continued integration of ML
into materials discovery and identify key problems that will continue to
challenge researchers as the size of the literature's datasets and complexity
of models increases. Finally, we offer several possible solutions to these
challenges with a focus on retaining interpretability and share our thoughts on
magnifying the impact of ML on materials design.

the kinematic acceptance of rapidity ($y$) and transverse momentum ($p_{\rm

central 0--5\% collisions, a proton cumulant ratio is measured to be
$C_4/C_2=-0.85 \pm 0.09 ~(\rm stat.) \pm 0.82 ~(\rm syst.)$, which is less than
unity, the Poisson baseline. The hadronic transport UrQMD model reproduces our
$C_4/C_2$ in the measured acceptance. Compared to higher energy results and the
transport model calculations, the suppression in $C_4/C_2$ is consistent with
fluctuations driven by baryon number conservation and indicates an energy
regime dominated by hadronic interactions. These data imply that the QCD
critical region, if created in heavy-ion collisions, could only exist at

measure the Hubble constant with sufficient precision to weigh in on the $\sim
5\sigma$ Hubble tension. Most GW sources will have no identified
electromagnetic counterpart, leading to uncertainty in the redshift of the
source, and in turn a degeneracy between host galaxy distance, redshift, and
$H_0$. In the case where no electromagnetic counterparts are identified, it has
been proposed that a statistical canvassing of candidate GW hosts, found in a
large galaxy survey for example, can be used to accurately constrain the Hubble
constant. We study and simulate this ""galaxy voting"" method to compute $H_0$.
We find that the Hubble constant posterior is in general biased relative to the
true value even when making optimistic assumptions about the statistical
properties of the sample. Using the MICECAT light-cone catalog, we find that
the bias in the $H_0$ posteriors depends on the realization of the underlying
galaxy sample and the precision of the GW source distance measurement.

cost-effective way. However, most of existing methods either require
specialized hardware modification or suffer from poor imaging performance due
to the fundamental limit of off-the-shelf commodity WiFi devices in spatial
resolution. We observe that the recently developed reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS) could be a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Thus,
in this paper, we propose a RIS-aided WiFi imaging framework to achieve
high-resolution imaging with the off-the-shelf WiFi devices. Specifically, we
first design a beamforming method to achieve the first-stage imaging by
separating the signals from different spatial locations with the aid of the
RIS. Then, we propose an optimization-based super-resolution imaging algorithm
by leveraging the low rank nature of the reconstructed object. During the
optimization, we also explicitly take into account the effect of finite phase
quantization in RIS to avoid the resolution degradation due to quantization
errors. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework achieves median root
mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03 and median structural similarity (SSIM) of
0.52. The visual results show that high-resolution imaging results are achieved
with simulation signals at 5 GHz that are matched with commercial WiFi
802.11n/ac protocols.

popularity as a tool for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC). To improve
the feature extraction efficiency of HSIC under the condition of limited
samples, the current methods generally use deep models with plenty of layers.
However, deep network models are prone to overfitting and gradient vanishing
problems when samples are limited. In addition, the spatial resolution
decreases severely with deeper depth, which is very detrimental to spatial edge
feature extraction. Therefore, this letter proposes a shallow model for HSIC,
which is called depthwise over-parameterized convolutional neural network
(DOCNN). To ensure the effective extraction of the shallow model, the depthwise
over-parameterized convolution (DO-Conv) kernel is introduced to extract the
discriminative features. The depthwise over-parameterized Convolution kernel is
composed of a standard convolution kernel and a depthwise convolution kernel,
which can extract the spatial feature of the different channels individually
and fuse the spatial features of the whole channels simultaneously. Moreover,
to further reduce the loss of spatial edge features due to the convolution
operation, a dense residual connection (DRC) structure is proposed to apply to
the feature extraction part of the whole network. Experimental results obtained
from three benchmark data sets show that the proposed method outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and computational
efficiency.

and a novel orthorhombic phase (Pnma-I). The P4/mbm phase transforms to the
Pnma-I phase at around 106 GPa, accompanied by breakage of the B-octahedron.
The P4/mbm phase of LaB4 exhibits a high hardness (30.5 GPa) at ambient
conditions, which is comparable to that of the hard material B4C. The hardness
of the two low-enthalpy phases increases with pressure. The electronic band
structures shows that all of the competitive phases (two stable and two
metastable phases) are metallic. Phonon calculations shows the P4/mbm and
Pnma-I phases are thermodynamically stable in their respective pressure ranges.
This elucidation of the phase transition behavior and hardness of LaB4 provides
new knowledge on the interesting high-pressure behaviors of the rare-earth

Observatory on La Palma. In the experiment, a 35-cm telescope and a fast photon
counting receiver system are employed to resolve the return flux response
during laser frequency sweeps gaining insights into the population dynamics of
the sodium layer. At a launched laser power of 16.5 W, we find a maximum gain
in return flux of 22\% compared to a fixed-frequency laser. Our results suggest
a strong dependence of chirping gain on power density at the mesosphere, i.e.
laser power and seeing. Maximum gains are recorded at a chirping amplitude on
the order of 150 MHz and a chirping rate of 0.8 MHz $\mu$s$^{-1}$, as predicted
by theory. Time-resolved measurements during the chirping period confirm our
understanding of the population dynamics in the sodium layer. To our knowledge
these are the first measurements of return flux enhancement for laser guide
stars excited by a single frequency-chirped continuous-wave laser. For higher
laser powers, the effectiveness of chirping is expected to increase, which
could be highly beneficial for telescopes equipped with high-power laser guide
star adaptive optics systems, also for emerging space awareness applications
using laser guide stars such as satellite imaging and ground-to-space optical
communications.

information in the target domain rather than to overly elaborate training
strategies on the source domain as in many existing methods. Hence, we start
from a generic representation pre-trained by a cross-entropy loss and a
conventional distance-based classifier, along with an image retrieval view, to
employ a re-ranking process for calibrating a target distance matrix by
discovering the reciprocal k-nearest neighbours within the task. Assuming the
pre-trained representation is biased towards the source, we construct a
non-linear subspace to minimise task-irrelevant features therewithin while keep
more transferrable discriminative information by a hyperbolic tangent

such distance calibration information onto the pre-trained representation, a
Kullback-Leibler divergence loss is employed to gradually guide the model
towards the calibrated distance-based distribution. Extensive evaluations on

improve conventional distance-based classifiers in few-shot learning.

why training BatchNorm only can find the perform-well architectures with the
reduced supernet-training time, and 2) what is the difference between the
train-BN-only supernet and the standard-train supernet. We begin by showing
that the train-BN-only networks converge to the neural tangent kernel regime,
obtain the same training dynamics as train all parameters theoretically. Our
proof supports the claim to train BatchNorm only on supernet with less training
time. Then, we empirically disclose that train-BN-only supernet provides an
advantage on convolutions over other operators, cause unfair competition
between architectures. This is due to only the convolution operator being
attached with BatchNorm. Through experiments, we show that such unfairness
makes the search algorithm prone to select models with convolutions. To solve
this issue, we introduce fairness in the search space by placing a BatchNorm
layer on every operator. However, we observe that the performance predictor in

novel composite performance indicator to evaluate networks from three
perspectives: expressivity, trainability, and uncertainty, derived from the
theoretical property of BatchNorm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on multiple NAS-benchmarks (NAS-Bench101, NAS-Bench-201) and search

friends and acquaintances, online referral programs that promote sales through
existing users are becoming increasingly popular. Because it is all too common
that online networks reproduce historical structural bias, members of
disadvantaged groups often benefit less from such referral opportunities. For
instance, one-hop referral programs that distribute rewards only among pairs of
friends or followers may offer less rewards and opportunities to minorities in
networks where it was proved that their degrees is statistically smaller. Here,
we examine the fairness of general referral programs, increasingly popular
forms of marketing in which an existing referrer is encouraged to initiate the
recruitment of new referred users over multiple hops. While this clearly
expands opportunities for rewards, it remains unclear whether it helps
addressing fairness concerns, or make them worse. We show, from studying 4
real-world networks and performing theoretical analysis on networks created
with minority-majority affiliations and homophily, that the change of bias in
multi-hop referral programs highly depends on the network structures and the
referral strategies. Specifically, under three different constrained referral
strategies which limit the number of referrals each person can share to a fixed

without access to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, certain
referral strategies can still amplify the structural biases further when higher

different surface temperatures and chemical compositions, and calculate the
resulting spectra for various wind mass-loss rates and wind terminal
velocities. We find that the progenitors having an optically thick wind would
become brighter in the optical for a higher mass-loss rate (or a lower wind
terminal velocity), because of the formation of the photosphere in the extended
wind matter and the contribution from free-free and line emissions from the
wind. As a result, for the standard Wolf-Rayet wind mass-loss rate,
helium-deficient compact SN Ic progenitors would be brighter in the optical by
$\sim$3 mag compared to the case without the wind effects. We also find that
the color dependence on the photospheric temperature is non-monotonic because
of the wind effects. Our results imply that inferring the progenitor mass,
bolometric luminosity and effective temperature from the optical observation
using the standard stellar evolution model prediction can be misleading. By
comparing our fiducial model predictions with the detection limits of the
previous SN Ib/Ic progenitor searches, we conclude that a deep search with an

system to achieve fruitful collaboration and coordination. Limitation in the
existing asynchronous transmission based strategies in fast dissemination and
aggregation compels the designers to prune down such requirements as much as
possible. This also restricts the possible application areas of mobile
multi-robot systems. In this work, we introduce concurrent transmission based
strategy as an alternative. Despite the commonly found difficulties in
concurrent transmission such as microsecond level time synchronization,
hardware heterogeneity, etc., we demonstrate how it can be exploited for
multi-robot systems. We propose a split architecture where the two major
activities - communication and computation are carried out independently and
coordinate through periodic interactions. The proposed split architecture is
applied on a custom build full networked control system consisting of five
two-wheel differential drive mobile robots having heterogeneous architecture.
We use the proposed design in a leader-follower setting for coordinated dynamic
speed variation as well as the independent formation of various shapes.
Experiments show a centimeter-level spatial and millisecond-level temporal
accuracy while spending very low radio duty-cycling over multi-hop
communication under a wide testing area.

Indeed, searching for relevant medical literature is a key phase in

Queries in this context are highly complex, based on Boolean logic, include
free-text terms and index terms from standardised terminologies (e.g., MeSH),
and are difficult and time-consuming to build. The use of MeSH terms, in
particular, has been shown to improve the quality of the search results.

  This paper investigates methods to suggest MeSH terms based on an initial
Boolean query that includes only free-text terms. These methods promise to
automatically identify highly effective MeSH terms for inclusion in a

such as a robot, jointly control the system's behavior, enabling an effective
solution for various applications, including human-robot interaction. However,
a challenging problem in shared autonomy is safety because the human input may
be unknown and unpredictable, which affects the robot's safety constraints. If
the human input is a force applied through physical contact with the robot, it
also alters the robot's behavior to maintain safety. We address the safety
issue of shared autonomy in real-time applications by proposing a two-layer
control framework. In the first layer, we use the history of human input
measurements to infer what the human wants the robot to do and define the
robot's safety constraints according to that inference. In the second layer, we
formulate a rapidly-exploring random tree of barrier pairs, with each barrier
pair composed of a barrier function and a controller. Using the controllers in
these barrier pairs, the robot is able to maintain its safe operation under the
intervention from the human input. This proposed control framework allows the
robot to assist the human while preventing them from encountering safety
issues. We demonstrate the proposed control framework on a simulation of a
two-linkage manipulator robot.

of single species with a range boundary. The spatial movement and birth/death
processes of the species found within the range boundary are assumed to be
governed by the classic Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion equation, while the
movement of a free boundary describing the range limit is assumed to be
influenced by the weighted total population inside the range boundary and is
described by an integro-differential equation. Our free boundary equation is a
generalization of the classical Stefan problem that allows for nonlocal
influences on the boundary movement so that range expansion and shrinkage are
both possible. In this paper we prove that the new model is well posed and
possesses steady state. We show that the spreading speed of the range boundary
is smaller than that for the equivalent problem with a Stefan condition. This
implies that the nonlocal effect of the weighted total population on the
boundary movement slows down the spreading speed of the population. While the
classical Stefan condition categorizes asymptotic behavior via a
spreading-vanishing dichotomy, the new model extends this dichotomy to a
spreading-balancing-vanishing trichotomy. We specifically analyze how habitat
boundaries expand, balance or shrink. When the model is extended to have two
free boundaries, we observe the steady state scenario, asymmetric shifts, or
even boundaries moving synchronously in the same direction. These are newly
discovered phenomena in the free boundary problems for animal movement.

adaptive mesh deletion technology is also developed. The validity and
robustness of the proposed mixed framework are corroborated by four
representative numerical examples. By comparing the performance of Q1/P0 and
P2/P1, we conclude that the Q1/P0 formulation is a better choice for finite
strain fracture in nearly incompressible cases. Moreover, the numerical
examples also show that the combination of the proposed framework and
methodology has vast potential in simulating complex peeling and tearing
problems

improve the segmentation accuracy on the unlabeled target domain without

Fusion Adaptation (MFA) method. MFA basically considers three parallel
information fusion strategies, i.e., the cross-model fusion, temporal fusion
and a novel online-offline pseudo label fusion. Specifically, the
online-offline pseudo label fusion encourages the adaptive training to pay
additional attention to difficult regions that are easily ignored by offline
pseudo labels, therefore retaining more informative details. While the other
two fusion strategies may look standard, MFA pays significant efforts to raise
the efficiency and effectiveness for integration, and succeeds in injecting all
the three strategies into a unified framework. Experiments on two widely used
benchmarks, i.e., GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, show that our
method significantly improves the semantic segmentation adaptation, and sets up
new state of the art (58.2% and 62.5% mIoU, respectively). The code will be

safe navigation of autonomous agents in interactive scenarios. Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) has been widely applied in multi-agent interaction modeling
to generate diverse behavior and learn a low-dimensional representation for
interacting systems. However, existing literature did not formally discuss if a
VAE-based model can properly encode interaction into its latent space. In this
work, we argue that one of the typical formulations of VAEs in multi-agent
modeling suffers from an issue we refer to as social posterior collapse, i.e.,
the model is prone to ignoring historical social context when predicting the
future trajectory of an agent. It could cause significant prediction errors and
poor generalization performance. We analyze the reason behind this
under-explored phenomenon and propose several measures to tackle it. Afterward,
we implement the proposed framework and experiment on real-world datasets for
multi-agent trajectory prediction. In particular, we propose a novel sparse
graph attention message-passing (sparse-GAMP) layer, which helps us detect
social posterior collapse in our experiments. In the experiments, we verify
that social posterior collapse indeed occurs. Also, the proposed measures are
effective in alleviating the issue. As a result, the model attains better
generalization performance when historical social context is informative for
prediction.

constitute performance lower and upper bounds, respectively. Then, the
diversity order of each strategy is investigated based on the obtained

Existing state-of-the-art action localization methods divide each video into
multiple action units (i.e., proposals in two-stage methods and segments in
one-stage methods) and then perform action recognition/regression on each of
them individually, without explicitly exploiting their relations during
learning. In this paper, we claim that the relations between action units play
an important role in action localization, and a more powerful action detector
should not only capture the local content of each action unit but also allow a
wider field of view on the context related to it. To this end, we propose a
general graph convolutional module (GCM) that can be easily plugged into
existing action localization methods, including two-stage and one-stage
paradigms. To be specific, we first construct a graph, where each action unit
is represented as a node and their relations between two action units as an
edge. Here, we use two types of relations, one for capturing the temporal
connections between different action units, and the other one for
characterizing their semantic relationship. Particularly for the temporal
connections in two-stage methods, we further explore two different kinds of
edges, one connecting the overlapping action units and the other one connecting
surrounding but disjointed units. Upon the graph we built, we then apply graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) to model the relations among different action
units, which is able to learn more informative representations to enhance
action localization. Experimental results show that our GCM consistently
improves the performance of existing action localization methods, including
two-stage methods (e.g., CBR and R-C3D) and one-stage methods (e.g., D-SSAD),
verifying the generality and effectiveness of our GCM.

attractive system design paradigm due to the drastic reduction in development
time and cost compared to custom solutions. However, it brings in a growing
concern of trustworthiness arising from the possibility of embedded malicious
logic, or hardware Trojans in COTS components. Existing trust-verification
approaches are typically not applicable to COTS hardware due to the absence of
golden models and the lack of observability of internal signals. In this work,
we propose a novel approach for runtime Trojan detection and resilience in
untrusted COTS processors through judicious modifications in software. The
proposed approach does not rely on any hardware redundancy or architectural
modification and hence seamlessly integrates with the COTS-based system design
process. Trojan resilience is achieved through the execution of multiple
functionally equivalent software variants. We have developed and implemented a
solution for compiler-based automatic generation of program variants,
metric-guided selection of variants, and their integration in a single
executable. To evaluate the proposed approach, we first analyzed the
effectiveness of program variants in avoiding the activation of a random pool
of Trojans. By implementing several Trojans in an OpenRISC 1000 processor, we
analyzed the detectability and resilience during Trojan activation in both
single and multiple variants. We also present delay and code size overhead for
the automatically generated variants for several programs and discuss future

classification paradigm, which constrains the more severe type of error (e.g.,
the type I error) under a preferred level while minimizing the other (e.g., the
type II error). However, there has been little research on the NP paradigm
under label noise. It is somewhat surprising that even when common NP
classifiers ignore the label noise in the training stage, they are still able
to control the type I error with high probability. However, the price they pay
is excessive conservativeness of the type I error and hence a significant drop

lower bounds on the corruption severity, we propose the first theory-backed

the dynamics of two collinear particles, the ($S$, $P$ and $D$)-wave functions
of kaon-pair with different waves are introduced. By keeping the transverse
momenta, all possible diagrams including the hard spectator diagrams and
annihilation ones can be calculated in PQCD approach. Most results are well
consistent with the current measurements from BaBar, Belle and LHCb
experiments. Moreover, under the narrow-width approximation we can extract the
branching fractions of the two-body decays involving the resonant states, and
also predict the branching fractions of the corresponding quasi-two-body decays
$B\to K(\cal{R}\to )\pi^+\pi^-$. All prediction are expected to be tested in
the ongoing LHCb and Belle-II experiments.

pre-trained ImageNet weights for initialization. However, as a fine-grained
classification task, ReID is more challenging and exists a large domain gap
between ImageNet classification. Inspired by the great success of
self-supervised representation learning with contrastive objectives, in this
paper, we design an Unsupervised Pre-training framework for ReID based on the
contrastive learning (CL) pipeline, dubbed UP-ReID. During the pre-training, we
attempt to address two critical issues for learning fine-grained ReID features:
(1) the augmentations in CL pipeline may distort the discriminative clues in
person images. (2) the fine-grained local features of person images are not
fully-explored. Therefore, we introduce an intra-identity
(I$^2$-)regularization in the UP-ReID, which is instantiated as two constraints
coming from global image aspect and local patch aspect: a global consistency is
enforced between augmented and original person images to increase robustness to
augmentation, while an intrinsic contrastive constraint among local patches of
each image is employed to fully explore the local discriminative clues.
Extensive experiments on multiple popular Re-ID datasets, including PersonX,
Market1501, CUHK03, and MSMT17, demonstrate that our UP-ReID pre-trained model
can significantly benefit the downstream ReID fine-tuning and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Codes and models will be released to

$m_s^{\text{phy}}$ and the light quark mass is set to $m_s^{\text{phy}}/40$

contrast to the case at $T\simeq 205$ MeV $m_l^{-1} \partial \rho(\lambda,

getting closer to $T_c$ $\rho(\lambda, m_l)$ is no longer proportional to
$m_l^2$ and thus dilute instanton gas approximation is not valid for these
temperatures. We demonstrate the temperature dependence can be factored out in
$\partial \rho(\lambda, m_l)/ \partial m_l$ and $\partial^2 \rho(\lambda, m_l)/

cropping data augmentation, which selects sub-regions of an image to be used as
positive views in the self-supervised loss. The underlying assumption is that
randomly cropped and resized regions of a given image share information about
the objects of interest, which the learned representation will capture. This
assumption is mostly satisfied in datasets such as ImageNet where there is a
large, centered object, which is highly likely to be present in random crops of
the full image. However, in other datasets such as OpenImages or COCO, which
are more representative of real world uncurated data, there are typically
multiple small objects in an image. In this work, we show that self-supervised
learning based on the usual random cropping performs poorly on such datasets.
We propose replacing one or both of the random crops with crops obtained from
an object proposal algorithm. This encourages the model to learn both object
and scene level semantic representations. Using this approach, which we call
object-aware cropping, results in significant improvements over scene cropping
on classification and object detection benchmarks. For example, on OpenImages,
our approach achieves an improvement of 8.8% mAP over random scene-level
cropping using MoCo-v2 based pre-training. We also show significant
improvements on COCO and PASCAL-VOC object detection and segmentation tasks
over the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches. Our approach is
efficient, simple and general, and can be used in most existing contrastive and

players and a set $E$ of $m$ indivisible entities over discrete time steps
$1,2,\ldots,\tau$. At each time step $t \in [1,\tau]$, for every entity $e \in
E$, there is a restriction list $L_t(e)$ that prescribes the subset of players
to whom $e$ can be assigned and a non-negative value $v_t(e,p)$ of $e$ to every
player $p \in P$. The sets $P$ and $E$ are fixed beforehand. The sets
$L_t(\cdot)$ and values $v_t(\cdot,\cdot)$ are given in an online fashion. An
allocation is a distribution of $E$ among $P$, and we are interested in the
minimum total value of the entities received by a player according to the
allocation. In the static case, it is NP-hard to find an optimal allocation the
maximizes this minimum value. On the other hand, $\rho$-approximation
algorithms have been developed for certain values of $\rho \in (0,1]$. We
propose a $w$-lookahead algorithm for the multistage online maxmin allocation
problem for any fixed $w \geq 1$ in which the restriction lists and values of

for an entity to be assigned to the same player from one time step to the next.
The objective is to maximize the sum of the minimum values and stability
rewards over the time steps $1, 2, \ldots, \tau$. Our algorithm achieves a
competitive ratio of $(1-c)\rho$, where $c$ is the positive root of the

strengthening the adversarial examples but neglecting the increasing shift
between natural data and adversarial examples, leading to a dramatic decrease
in natural accuracy. To maintain the trade-off between natural and robust

propose a Feature Adaptive Adversarial Training (FAAT) optimizing the

enables the trade-off between natural and robust accuracy by generating
features with similar distribution across natural and adversarial data, and

(ML) that produce many individual decision trees. Due to the inherent ensemble
characteristic of these methods, they typically outperform single decision
trees or other ML models in predictive performance. However, numerous decision
paths are generated for each decision tree, increasing the overall complexity
of the model and hindering its use in domains that require trustworthy and
explainable decisions, such as finance, social care, and health care. Thus, the
interpretability of bagging and boosting algorithms, such as random forest and
adaptive boosting, reduces as the number of decisions rises. In this paper, we
propose a visual analytics tool that aims to assist users in extracting
decisions from such ML models via a thorough visual inspection workflow that
includes selecting a set of robust and diverse models (originating from
different ensemble learning algorithms), choosing important features according
to their global contribution, and deciding which decisions are essential for
global explanation (or locally, for specific cases). The outcome is a final
decision based on the class agreement of several models and the explored manual
decisions exported by users. We evaluated the applicability and effectiveness
of VisRuler via a use case, a usage scenario, and a user study. The evaluation
revealed that most users managed to successfully use our system to explore
decision rules visually, performing the proposed tasks and answering the given
questions in a satisfying way.

(singular) cubic hypersurfaces. An interesting question asks when a given cubic
hypersurface is projectively equivalent to a secant cubic hypersurface.
Inspired by the ''geometric'' Torelli theorem for smooth cubic hypersurfaces
due to F. Charles, we study the geometry of lines on secant cubics and describe
the Fano variety of lines. Then we verify the ''geometric'' Torelli theorem for
the case of secant cubics. Namely, a cubic hypersurface is isomorphic to a
secant cubic if and only if their Fano varieties of lines are isomorphic.

first proposed to explore intra-view global context. In addition, to further
enable dense features to be 3D-consistent, a 3D-geometry Transformer module is
built with a well-designed cross-view attention mechanism to facilitate
inter-view information interaction. Experimental results show that the proposed

tasks, but they have a critical issue: over-confident predictions even for
completely unknown samples. Many studies have been proposed to successfully
filter out these unknown samples, but they only considered narrow and specific
tasks, referred to as misclassification detection, open-set recognition, or
out-of-distribution detection. In this work, we argue that these tasks should
be treated as fundamentally an identical problem because an ideal model should
possess detection capability for all those tasks. Therefore, we introduce the
unknown detection task, an integration of previous individual tasks, for a
rigorous examination of the detection capability of deep neural networks on a
wide spectrum of unknown samples. To this end, unified benchmark datasets on
different scales were constructed and the unknown detection capabilities of
existing popular methods were subject to comparison. We found that Deep
Ensemble consistently outperforms the other approaches in detecting unknowns;
however, all methods are only successful for a specific type of unknown. The

The luminosity of these extreme pulsars, if isotropic, implies an extreme mass
transfer rate. An alternative is to assume a much lower mass transfer rate, but
with an apparent luminosity boosted by geometrical beaming. Only an independent
measurement of the mass transfer rate can help discriminate between these two
scenarios. In this Paper, we follow the orbit of the neutron star for seven
years, measure the decay of the orbit
($\dot{P}_{orb}/{P}_{orb}\approx-8\cdot10^{-6}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), and argue
that this orbital decay is driven by extreme mass transfer of more than 150
times the mass transfer limit set by the Eddington luminosity. If this is true,
the mass available to the accretor is more than enough to justify its
luminosity, with no need for beaming. This also strongly favors models where
the accretor is a highly-magnetized neutron star.

by using the non-maximum suppression (NMS) and its improved versions like
Soft-NMS to remove redundant bounding boxes. We challenge those NMS-based
methods from three aspects: 1) The bounding box with highest confidence value
may not be the true positive having the biggest overlap with the ground-truth
box. 2) Not only suppression is required for redundant boxes, but also
confidence enhancement is needed for those true positives. 3) Sorting candidate
boxes by confidence values is not necessary so that full parallelism is
achievable.
  In this paper, inspired by belief propagation (BP), we propose the Confidence
Propagation Cluster (CP-Cluster) to replace NMS-based methods, which is fully
parallelizable as well as better in accuracy. In CP-Cluster, we borrow the
message passing mechanism from BP to penalize redundant boxes and enhance true
positives simultaneously in an iterative way until convergence. We verified the
effectiveness of CP-Cluster by applying it to various mainstream detectors such
as FasterRCNN, SSD, FCOS, YOLOv3, YOLOv5, Centernet etc. Experiments on MS COCO
show that our plug and play method, without retraining detectors, is able to
steadily improve average mAP of all those state-of-the-art models with a clear
margin from 0.3 to 1.9 respectively when compared with NMS-based methods.

improved significantly in recent years, existing approaches typically generate
3D poses defined in camera or human-centered coordinate system. This makes it
difficult to estimate a person's pure pose and motion in world coordinate
system for a video captured using a moving camera. To address this issue, this
paper presents a camera motion agnostic approach for predicting 3D human pose
and mesh defined in the world coordinate system. The core idea of the proposed
approach is to estimate the difference between two adjacent global poses (i.e.,
global motion) that is invariant to selecting the coordinate system, instead of
the global pose coupled to the camera motion. To this end, we propose a network
based on bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) that predicts the global
motion sequence from the local pose sequence consisting of relative rotations
of joints called global motion regressor (GMR). We use 3DPW and synthetic
datasets, which are constructed in a moving-camera environment, for evaluation.
We conduct extensive experiments and prove the effectiveness of the proposed
method empirically. Code and datasets are available at

interactions and shock radiations from such systems and show that the bimodal
structures observed in keV/TeV light curves are caused by enhanced synchrotron
radiation and IC scattering during disc passages. We use a simple radiation
model to reproduce orbital modulations of keV X-ray and TeV $\gamma$-ray flux
and compare with two confirmed pulsar/Be star binaries (i.e. PSR B1259-63/LS
2883 and PSR J2032+4127/MT91 213), and two candidates (i.e. HESS J0632+057 and

binaries can be well explained by the inclined disc model, while modelling the
modulated emissions of the latter two sources remains challenging with current
orbital solutions. Therefore, we propose alternative orbital geometries for
HESS J0632+057 and LS I +61$^{\circ}$303. We estimate the positions and

reducing the stress on the distribution grid. This paper proposes energy
management strategies for a novel multi-battery design that directly connects
its strings to other DC components through a busbar matrix without the need for
interfacing power converters. Hence, the energy management system has two
degrees of control: (i) allocating strings to other DC microgrid components, in
this case a photovoltaic system, two EV fast chargers, and a grid-tie inverter,
and (ii) managing the energy exchange with the local distribution grid. For the
grid exchange, a basic droop control is compared to an enhanced control
including forecasts in the decision making. To this end, this paper evaluates
results from multiple Monte Carlo simulations capturing the uncertainty of EV
charging. For a realistic charging behaviour in each simulation run, random
fast-charging profiles were created based on probability distributions of
actual fast-charging data for arrival time, charging duration, and requested
energy. The impact of different utilisation levels of the chargers was assessed
by varying the average charging instances from 1 to 30 EVs per day. Using
actual photovoltaic measurements from different months, the numerical analyses
show that the enhanced control increases self-sufficiency by reducing grid
exchange, and decreases the number of battery cycles. However, the enhanced
control operates the battery closer to its charge limits, which may accelerate
calendar ageing.

at constant strain rate. In order to study the influence of twin boundaries on
the crack growth behaviour, single and multiple twin boundaries were introduced

following the introduction of twin boundaries, a noticeable plastic deformation

been observed between the crack growth rate and flow stress.

comprise sufficient information to reproduce music aurally, they cannot contain
adequate information to represent music visually in terms of notation. Musical
scores contain various musical symbols (e.g., clef, key signature, and notes)

Transformer model to transcribe note-level representation into appropriate

clusters (younger than ~2 Gyr) are known features caused by fast rotating
early-type (earlier than F-type) stars. Late-type stars are not fast rotators
because their initial angular momenta have been quickly dispersed due to
magnetic braking. However, the mass limit below which stars have been
magnetically braked has not been well constrained by observation. In this
paper, we present an analysis of the eMSTO of NGC 6819, an open cluster of an
intermediate-age (~2.5 Gyr), believed to be comparable to the lifetime of stars
near the mass limit for magnetic braking. By comparing the observation with
synthetic CMDs, we find that NGC 6819 does not harbor an obvious eMSTO. The
morphology of its TO region can be readily explained by a simple stellar
population considering the observational uncertainties as well as the
differential reddening. In addition, the MSTO stars in NGC 6819 have very small
values of average rotational velocity and dispersion, indicating that they have
undergone significant magnetic braking. Combining with results in the
literature for clusters of younger ages, our current work suggests that the
critical age for the disappearance of eMSTO in star clusters must be shorter
but very close to the age of NGC 6819, and this, in turn, implies a critical
stellar mass for magnetic braking at solar metallicity above but close to 1.54
$M_{\odot}$ based on the PARSEC model. We emphasize that the phenomenon of
eMSTO could provide a unique way to constrain the onset mass of magnetic
braking.

that the sketches also are categorical, sparse, and the Hamming distance

with related algorithms on some real-world datasets. We show that FSketch is
significantly faster, and the accuracy obtained by using its sketches are among

serves to provide the characteristic discrimination in the muon scattering

the collection of exactly four hit locations in four detector layers among
which two top detector layers are utilized to construct the first vector,
whereas the second vector is built by using two bottom detector layers.
Although this procedure acts to classify the target volumes in the tomographic
systems based on the muon scattering, the scattering angle obtained through the
usual methodology founded on four detector layers is dubious for not yielding
any information about the position of target volume. Nonetheless, the same set
of four detector layers also imparts the possibility of splitting the
scattering angle into two separate angles by creating a triangular correlation
in such a way that the scattering angle is referred to an exterior angle,
whereas the separate angles are considered the interior opposite angles that
are not neighboring this exterior angle. In this study, we first show that a
combination of three detector layers out of four fulfills the calculation of
the interior opposite angles. Then, by employing the GEANT4 simulations over
our tomographic configuration composed of three plastic scintillators in either

vertical spatial variation, while the exterior angle approximately remains
constant, thereby implying a beneficial feature to be used for the image

Adversarial Training (FAT) was proposed that can obtain robust models

theory of coreset selection, we show how selecting a small subset of training

adapted to a wide variety of training objectives, including TRADES,
$\ell_p$-PGD, and Perceptual Adversarial Training (PAT). Our experimental
results indicate that our approach speeds up adversarial training by 2-3 times

thinnest and highest-Tc member of iron-based superconductors, the standard
electron-hole Fermi pocket nesting scenario is apparently not applicable since
the Gamma-centered hole pockets are absent, so the actual pairing mechanism is
the subject of intense debate. Here, by measuring high-resolution Bogoliubov
quasiparticle interference, we report observations of highly anisotropic
magnetic Cooper pairing in 1-UC FeSe. From a theoretical point of view, it is
important to incorporate effects of electronic correlations within a
spin-fluctuation pairing calculation, where the dxy orbital becomes
coherence-suppressed. The resulting pairing gap is compatible with the
experimental findings, which suggests that high-Tc Cooper pairing with orbital

neural networks that integrate data of scalar field and physics laws to
determine the velocity in the height direction. The underlying enforcing
physics laws are derived from the Navier-Stokes equation and the scalar
transport equation. Apart from this, dynamic concentration boundary condition
is adopted to improve the velocity measurement of laminar flow with small
Reynolds Number in microchannels. The proposed DNN-SIV is validated and
analyzed by numerical simulations. Compared to integral minimization algorithm

areas of mathematics, the problem of studying the growth rate of the norms of
all possible matrix products $A_{\sigma_{n}}\cdots A_{\sigma_{0}}$ with factors
from a set of matrices $\mathscr{A}$ arises. So far, only for a relatively
small number of classes of matrices $\mathscr{A}$ has it been possible to
accurately describe the sequences of matrices that guarantee the maximum rate
of increase of the corresponding norms. Moreover, in almost all cases studied
theoretically, the index sequences $\{\sigma_{n}\}$ of matrices maximizing the
norms of the corresponding matrix products have been shown to be periodic or
so-called Sturmian, which entails a whole set of ""good"" properties of the
sequences $\{A_{\sigma_{n}}\}$, in particular the existence of a limiting
frequency of occurrence of each matrix factor $A_{i}\in\mathscr{A}$ in them. In
the paper it is shown that this is not always the case: a class of matrices is
defined consisting of two $2\times 2$ matrices, similar to rotations in the
plane, in which the sequence $\{A_{\sigma_{n}}\}$ maximizing the growth rate of
the norms $\|A_{\sigma_{n}}\cdots A_{\sigma_{0}}\|$ is not Sturmian. All
considerations are based on numerical modeling and cannot be considered
mathematically rigorous in this part; rather, they should be interpreted as a
set of questions for further comprehensive theoretical analysis.

  arXiv:2102.01771",,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we explore the connection between secret key agreement and
secure omniscience within the setting of the multiterminal source model with a
wiretapper who has side information. While the secret key agreement problem
considers the generation of a maximum-rate secret key through public
discussion, the secure omniscience problem is concerned with communication
protocols for omniscience that minimize the rate of information leakage to the
wiretapper. The starting point of our work is a lower bound on the minimum
leakage rate for omniscience, $R_{\mathop{\mathrm{L}}}$, in terms of the
wiretap secret key capacity, $C_{\mathop{\mathrm{W}}}$. Our interest is in
identifying broad classes of sources for which this lower bound is met with
equality, in which case we say that there is a duality between secure
omniscience and secret key agreement. We show that this duality holds in the
case of certain finite linear source (FLS) models, such as two-terminal FLS
models and pairwise independent network models on trees with a linear
wiretapper. Duality also holds for any FLS model in which
$C_{\mathop{\mathrm{W}}}$ is achieved by a perfect linear secret key agreement
scheme. We conjecture that the duality in fact holds unconditionally for any
FLS model. On the negative side, we give an example of a (non-FLS) source model
for which duality does not hold if we limit ourselves to
communication-for-omniscience protocols with at most two (interactive)
communications. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our lower bound on
$R_{\mathop{\mathrm{L}}}$ by using it to derive equivalent conditions for the
positivity of $C_{\mathop{\mathrm{W}}}$ in the multiterminal model. This
extends a recent result of Gohari, G\""{u}nl\""{u} and Kramer (2020) obtained for

combinatorial optimisation structure learning problems. It then performs model
averaging in the hill-climbing search process and moves to the neighbouring
graph that maximises the objective function, on average, for that neighbouring

of aggressive pruning with model averaging is both effective and efficient,

Inspired by \emph{Spiral Curriculum}, which enhances learning processes by
revisiting knowledge, we propose a form of spiral learning which revisits
visual representations based on a sequence of attribute groups (e.g., a
combined group of \emph{color} and \emph{shape}). Spiral learning aims to learn
generalized local correlations, enabling models to gradually enhance global
learning and thus understand complex correlations. Our implementation is based
on a 2-stage \emph{Reinforced Self-Revised (RSR)} framework: \emph{preview} and
\emph{review}. RSR first previews visual information to construct diverse
attribute groups in a weakly-supervised manner. Then, it spirally learns
refined localities based on attribute groups and uses localities to revise
global semantic correlations. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms on four benchmark datasets in both zero-shot and generalized
zero-shot settings, which demonstrates the effectiveness of spiral learning in
learning generalizable and complex correlations. We also conduct extensive
analysis to show that attribute groups and reinforced decision processes can
capture complementary semantic information to improve predictions and aid
explainability.

trade and production. The resulting international supply networks not only
increase wealth for countries, but also create systemic risk: economic shocks,
triggered by company failures in one country, may propagate to other countries.
Using global supply network data on the firm-level, we present a method to
estimate a country's exposure to direct and indirect economic losses caused by
the failure of a company in another country. We show the network of systemic
risk-flows across the world. We find that rich countries expose poor countries
much more to systemic risk than the other way round. We demonstrate that higher
systemic risk levels are not compensated with a risk premium in GDP, nor do
they correlate with economic growth. Systemic risk around the globe appears to
be distributed more unequally than wealth. These findings put the often praised
benefits for developing countries from globalized production in a new light,
since they relate them to the involved risks in the production processes.
Exposure risks present a new dimension of global inequality, that most affects
the poor in supply shock crises. It becomes fully quantifiable with the
proposed method.

leads to a diffusion operator including derivatives of the stream function

services. However, real world deployments are rare, as RL struggles with
dynamic nature of real world environments, requiring time for learning a task
and adapting to changes in the environment. Transfer Learning (TL) can help
lower these adaptation times. In particular, there is a significant potential
of applying TL in multi-agent RL systems, where multiple agents can share
knowledge with each other, as well as with new agents that join the system. To
obtain the most from inter-agent transfer, transfer roles (i.e., determining
which agents act as sources and which as targets), as well as relevant transfer
content parameters (e.g., transfer size) should be selected dynamically in each
particular situation. As a first step towards fully dynamic transfers, in this
paper we investigate the impact of TL transfer parameters with fixed source and
target roles. Specifically, we label every agent-environment interaction with
agent's epistemic confidence, and we filter the shared examples using varying
threshold levels and sample sizes. We investigate impact of these parameters in

Using the Hall array measurements, we generate a real-time three-dimensional
map of local average current distribution around the superconductor used in our
prototype of SCFCL. Our measurements show that, even for currents less than the
critical current a non-uniform current flow pattern exists around the
superconductor which we have used in the prototype. The capability of
real-time, three-dimensional monitoring of the average local current
distribution offers a way for the early detection of instabilities like
hotspots developing in a superconductor. We discuss the use of this technique
to not only show how it offers early detection and protection against
instabilities developing in the superconductor, but also how it offers an added
flexibility, namely, a user-settable fault current threshold.

using Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP). Our MIP model balances the optimization
of prediction margin and model size by using a weighted objective that:
minimizes the total margin of incorrectly classified training instances,
maximizes the total margin of correctly classified training instances, and
maximizes the overall model regularization. We conduct two sets of experiments
to test the classification accuracy of our MIP model over standard and
corrupted versions of multiple classification datasets, respectively. In the
first set of experiments, we show that our MIP model outperforms an equivalent
Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) model and achieves competitive results to
Logistic Regression (LR) and Gradient Descent (GD) in terms of classification
accuracy over the standard datasets. In the second set of experiments, we show
that our MIP model outperforms the other models (i.e., GD and LR) in terms of

visually demonstrate the interpretability of our MIP model in terms of its

not rely on any pre-existing data, can locate low energy structures of complex
cathode materials efficiently based only on chemical composition. We use AIRSS
to explore three Fe-containing polyanion compounds as low-cost cathodes. Using
known quaternary LiFePO4 and quinary LiFeSO4F cathodes as examples, we easily
reproduce the known polymorphs, in addition to predicting other, hitherto
unknown, low energy polymorphs, and even finding a new polymorph of LiFeSO4F
which is more stable than the known ones. We then explore the phase space for
Fe-containing fluoroxalates, predicting a range of redox-active phases that
have yet to be experimentally synthesized, demonstrating the suitability of
AIRSS as a tool for accelerating the discovery of novel cathode materials.

Our key observation, based on analysis of known Russian-sponsored troll

accounts controlled by the same actor often show similarities that can be
leveraged for detection. TROLLMAGNIFIER learns the typical behavior of known

TROLLMAGNIFIER on a set of 335 known troll accounts and run it on a large
dataset of Reddit accounts. Our system identifies 1,248 potential troll
accounts; we then provide a multi-faceted analysis to corroborate the
correctness of our classification. In particular, 66% of the detected accounts
show signs of being instrumented by malicious actors (e.g., they were created
on the same exact day as a known troll, they have since been suspended by
Reddit, etc.). They also discuss similar topics as the known troll accounts and
exhibit temporal synchronization in their activity. Overall, we show that using

proposed two novel predictor-corrector methods for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert

so-called Landau-Lifshitz form of LLG, use mass-lumped variational formulations
discretized by first-order finite elements, and only require the solution of
linear systems, despite the nonlinearity of LLG. The first(-order in time)
method combines a linear update with an explicit projection of an intermediate
approximation onto the unit sphere in order to fulfill the LLG-inherent
unit-length constraint at the discrete level. In the second(-order in time)
integrator, the projection step is replaced by a linear constraint-preserving
variational formulation. In this paper, we extend the analysis of the
integrators by proving unconditional well-posedness and by establishing a close
connection of the methods with other approaches available in the literature.
Moreover, the new analysis also provides a well-posed integrator for the

the coupling between the spin and the squeezed magnons can be exponentially
enhanced. This in turn allows the spin-magnon distance to increase from nano-

magnons in the dispersive regime, strong spin-spin coupling mediated by the
squeezed magnons can be achieved, and a remote quantum-state transfer, as well

more attention as a novel approach of multiplexing a set of orthogonal OAM
modes on the same frequency channel to achieve high spectral efficiency (SE).
However, the precondition for maintaining the orthogonality among different OAM
modes is perfect alignment of the transmit and receive uniform circular arrays
(UCAs), which is difficult to be satisfied in practical wireless communication
scenario. Therefore, to achieve available multi-mode OAM broadband wireless
communication, we first investigate the effect of oblique angles on the
transmission performance of the multi-mode OAM broadband system in the
non-parallel misalignment case. Then, we compare the UCA-based RF analog and
baseband digital transceiver structures and corresponding beam steering
schemes. Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations validate that the SE
of the misaligned multi-mode OAM broadband system is quite low, while analog
and digital beam steering both can significantly improve the SE of the system.
However, digital beam steering can obtain higher SE than analog beam steering
especially when the bandwidth and the number of array elements are large, which
validates that baseband digital transceiver with digital beam steering is more
suitable for multi-mode OAM broadband wireless communication systems in
practice.

encoded in the Euclidean two-point correlation functions. The extraction of
hadron spectral functions from the correlator is a typical ill-posed inverse
problem and infinite number of solutions to this problem exists. We propose a
novel neural network (sVAE) based on the Variation Auto-Encoder (VAE) and
Bayesian theorem. Inspired by the maximum entropy method (MEM) we construct the
loss function of the neural work such that it includes a Shannon-Jaynes entropy
term and a likelihood term. The sVAE is then trained to provide the most
probable spectral functions. For the training samples of spectral function we
used general spectral functions produced from the Gaussian Mixture Model. After
the training is done we performed the mock data tests with input spectral
functions consisting 1) only a free continuum, 2) only a resonance peak, 3) a
resonance peak plus a free continuum and 4) a NRQCD motivated spectral
function. From the mock data test we find that the sVAE in most cases is
comparable to the maximum entropy method in the quality of reconstructing
spectral functions and even outperforms the MEM in the case where the spectral
function has sharp peaks with insufficient number of data points in the
correlator. By applying to temporal correlation functions of charmonium in the
pseudoscalar channel obtained in the quenched lattice QCD at 0.75 $T_c$ on

already achieves competitive results to strong baselines. In addition, the
computational overhead is minimal in contrast to previous approaches. Our

propose novel relations between the derivatives ($\partial^n

respect to the quark mass ($m_l$) and the $(n+1)$-point correlations among the
eigenvalues ($\lambda$) of the massless Dirac operator. Based on these
relations, we present lattice QCD results for $\partial^n
\rho(\lambda,m_l)/\partial m_l^n$ ($n=1, 2, 3$) with $m_l$ corresponding to
pion masses $m_\pi=160-55$ MeV, and at a temperature of about 1.6 times the
chiral phase transition temperature. Calculations were carried out using
(2+1)-flavors of highly improved staggered quarks and the tree-level Symanzik
gauge action with the physical strange quark mass, three lattice spacings
$a=0.12, 0.08, 0.06$ fm, and lattices having aspect ratios $4-9$. We find that
$\rho(\lambda\to0,m_l)$ develops a peaked structure. This peaked structure,
which arises due to non-Poisson correlations within the infrared part of the
Dirac eigenvalue spectrum, becomes sharper as $a\to0$, and its amplitude is
proportional to $m_l^2$. After continuum and chiral extrapolations, we find
that the axial anomaly remains manifested in two-point correlation functions of
scalar and pseudo-scalar mesons in the chiral limit. We demonstrate that the

  in a Tokamak equilibrium","49 pages, 33 figures",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chirping Alfv\'{e}n modes are considered as potentially harmful in burning
Tokamak plasmas. In this paper, the nonlinear evolution of a
single-toroidal-number chirping mode is analysed by numerical particle
simulation. This analysis can be simplified if the different resonant
phase-space structures can be investigated as isolated ones. This can be done
adopting a coordinate system that includes two constants of motion. In our
simulations, we adopt as constants of motion, the magnetic momentum and the
initial particle coordinates. For each resonant structure, a density-flattening
region is formed around the respective resonance radius, with radial width that
increases as the mode amplitude grows. It is delimited by two large negative
density gradients, drifting inward and outward. With constant mode frequency,
this density flattening would be responsible for the exhausting of the drive
when large negative density gradients leave the resonance region. The frequency
chirping, however, causes the resonance radius and the resonance region to
drift inward. This drift delays the moment in which the inner density gradient
reaches the inner boundary of the resonance region. On the other side, the
island reconstitutes around the new resonance radius; as a consequence, the
large negative density gradient further moves inward. This process continues as
long as it allows to keep the large gradient within the resonance region. When
this is no longer possible, the resonant structure ceases to be effective in
driving the mode. To further grow, the mode has to tap a different resonant
structure, possibly making use of additional frequency variations.

where only video-sentence annotations are available during model learning. It
aims to localize objects described in the sentence to visual regions in the
video, which is a fundamental capability needed in pattern analysis and machine
learning. Despite the recent progress, existing methods all suffer from the
severe problem of spurious association, which will harm the grounding
performance. In this paper, we start from the definition of WSVOG and pinpoint
the spurious association from two aspects: (1) the association itself is not
object-relevant but extremely ambiguous due to weak supervision, and (2) the
association is unavoidably confounded by the observational bias when taking the
statistics-based matching strategy in existing methods. With this in mind, we
design a unified causal framework to learn the deconfounded object-relevant
association for more accurate and robust video object grounding. Specifically,
we learn the object-relevant association by causal intervention from the
perspective of video data generation process. To overcome the problems of
lacking fine-grained supervision in terms of intervention, we propose a novel
spatial-temporal adversarial contrastive learning paradigm. To further remove
the accompanying confounding effect within the object-relevant association, we
pursue the true causality by conducting causal intervention via backdoor
adjustment. Finally, the deconfounded object-relevant association is learned
and optimized under a unified causal framework in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments on both IID and OOD testing sets of three benchmarks
demonstrate its accurate and robust grounding performance against
state-of-the-arts.

graphs based on randomization as a term of comparison to verify whether a

that combines the null model with data augmentation for graph classification.
Moreover, we propose four standard null model-based augmentation methods and
four approximate null model-based augmentation methods to verify and improve
the performance of our graph classification technique. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed augmentation technique has significantly achieved
general improvement on the tested datasets. In addition, we find that the
standard null model-based augmentation methods always outperform the

An open question is whether and how theoretical consistency translates into
practice, in comparison to inconsistent algorithms. In this paper, we
empirically investigate this question on a set of representative meta-RL
algorithms. We find that theoretically consistent algorithms can indeed usually
adapt to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while inconsistent ones cannot,
although they can still fail in practice for reasons like poor exploration. We
further find that theoretically inconsistent algorithms can be made consistent
by continuing to update all agent components on the OOD tasks, and adapt as
well or better than originally consistent ones. We conclude that theoretical
consistency is indeed a desirable property, and inconsistent meta-RL algorithms
can easily be made consistent to enjoy the same benefits.

the presence of two distinct gas phases: a cold and metal-rich and a warm one

in interstellar space releases appreciable amounts of energy that need to be
dissipated to the environment. Here, energy transfer between CO$_2$ formed
within and on the surface of amorphous solid water (ASW) and the surrounding
water is studied. Following CO($^1 \Sigma^+$) + O($^1$D) recombination the
average translational and internal energy of the water molecules increases on
the $\sim 10$ ps time scale by 15 % to 20 % depending on whether the reaction
takes place on the surface or in an internal cavity of ASW. Due to tight
coupling between CO$_2$ and the surrounding water molecules the internal energy
exhibits a peak at early times which is present for recombination on the
surface but absent for the process inside ASW. Energy transfer to the water
molecules is characterized by a rapid $\sim 10$ ps and a considerably slower
$\sim 1$ ns component. Within 50 ps a mostly uniform temperature increase of
the ASW across the entire surface is found. The results suggest that energy
transfer between a molecule formed on and within ASW is efficient and helps to
stabilize the products generated.

hinder the progress of this field. Considering the success in semantic scene
understanding under clear weather, we think it is reasonable to transfer
knowledge learned from clear images to the foggy domain. As such, the problem
becomes to bridge the domain gap between clear images and foggy images. Unlike
previous methods that mainly focus on closing the domain gap caused by fog --
defogging the foggy images or fogging the clear images, we propose to alleviate
the domain gap by considering fog influence and style variation simultaneously.
The motivation is based on our finding that the style-related gap and the
fog-related gap can be divided and closed respectively, by adding an
intermediate domain. Thus, we propose a new pipeline to cumulatively adapt
style, fog and the dual-factor (style and fog). Specifically, we devise a
unified framework to disentangle the style factor and the fog factor
separately, and then the dual-factor from images in different domains.
Furthermore, we collaborate the disentanglement of three factors with a novel
cumulative loss to thoroughly disentangle these three factors. Our method
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks and shows
generalization ability in rainy and snowy scenes.

model of PCPD has been controversially discussed since its infancy. To our best
knowledge, there is so far no consensus on whether the phase transition of the
PCPD falls into the unknown university classes or else conveys a new kind of
non-equilibrium phase transition. In this paper, both unsupervised and
supervised learning are employed to study the PCPD with scrutiny. Firstly, two
unsupervised learning methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and
autoencoder, are taken. Our results show that both methods can cluster the
original configurations of the model and provide reasonable estimates of
thresholds. Therefore, no matter whether the non-equilibrium lattice model is a
random process of unitary (for instance the DP) or binary (for instance the
PCP), or whether it contains the diffusion motion of particles, unsupervised
leaning can capture the essential, hidden information. Beyond that, supervised
learning is also applied to learning the PCPD at different diffusion rates. We
proposed a more accurate numerical method to determine the spatial correlation
exponent $\nu_{\perp}$, which, to a large degree, avoids the uncertainty of
data collapses through naked eyes. Our extensive calculations reveal that
$\nu_{\perp}$ of PCPD depends continuously on the diffusion rate $D$, which
supports the viewpoint that the PCPD may lead to a new type of absorbing phase

4-fermion operators, where the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic modular forms
appear. From the Ansatz, the $A_4$ modular-invariant semileptonic four-fermion
operator $[\,\bar E_R \Gamma E_R][\,\bar D_R \Gamma D_R\,]$ does not lead to
the flavor changing (FC) processes since this operator would be constructed in
terms of gauge couplings $g$ as $y^{(3)} \sim g$. The chirality flipped
bilinear operator $[\,\bar D_R \Gamma D_L\,]$ also does not lead FC if the
mediated mode corresponds to the Higgs boson $H_d$. In this case, the flavor
structure of this operator is the exactly same as the mass matrix. On the other
hand, if the flavor structure of the operator is not the exactly same as the
mass matrix, the situation would change drastically. Then, we obtain the
non-trivial relations of FC transitions at nearby fixed points

application, we discuss the relations of the lepton flavor violation processes

suppress decoherence processes and lead to highly indistinguishable
single-photon generation. It has, however, remained a challenge to implement
strict resonant excitation in a stable and scalable way, without compromising

allows exploiting one mode for excitation of the QD and the other mode for

single-photon collection efficiency of $\beta > 0.95$ together with a
single-photon impurity of $\epsilon< 5 \times 10^{-3}$ over a broad spectral

Recent progress on unsupervised pretraining methods shows superior transfer
performance to their supervised counterparts. This paper revisits this

unsupervised and supervised pretraining from a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
perspective. While previous works focus on the effectiveness of MLP on
unsupervised image classification where pretraining and evaluation are
conducted on the same dataset, we reveal that the MLP projector is also the key
factor to better transferability of unsupervised pretraining methods than
supervised pretraining methods. Based on this observation, we attempt to close
the transferability gap between supervised and unsupervised pretraining by
adding an MLP projector before the classifier in supervised pretraining. Our
analysis indicates that the MLP projector can help retain intra-class variation
of visual features, decrease the feature distribution distance between
pretraining and evaluation datasets, and reduce feature redundancy. Extensive
experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that the added MLP projector
significantly boosts the transferability of supervised pretraining, e.g. +7.2%
top-1 accuracy on the concept generalization task, +5.8% top-1 accuracy for
linear evaluation on 12-domain classification tasks, and +0.8% AP on COCO

this work, we propose a novel SALS (\textit{Structure-Aware Label Smoothing})

leverages the graph structures to capture the semantic correlations between the

the original one-hot label vectors, thus improving the node classification

results show that SALS is superior to the label smoothing method and enhances

the orthorhombic phase by an Einstein or T2 type behavior, which was then
compared with the experimental EXAFS parameters of the tetragonal/cubic phase.
In the orthorhombic phase, it was observed that the asymmetry of the pair
distribution function (cumulant C3) in MAPbCl3 is much lower than in MAPbI3.
Compared with the behavior in the orthorhombic phase, the anharmonicity changed
after the phase transition to the room temperature phase, with MAPbCl3 showing
an increased anharmonicity and MAPbI3 a decrease. The differences between
MAPbI3 and 2% chlorine substitution were small, both in the orthorhombic and
tetragonal phases. By determining the structural parameters required to convert
the effective force constants k0 and k3 resulting from the EXAFS analysis into
the Morse potential parameters {\alpha} and D, we could establish that our
results agree with other experimental findings. Moreover, by using XRD we found
that the [PbX6] octahedra shrink slightly in the tetragonal phase of MAPbI3 and

perfectly aligned NV centers, which showed a higher readout contrast than NV
centers having four equally distributed orientations. However, to estimate the
azimuthal angle of the target magnetic field with respect to the NV axis in

problem, especially when attempting to measure vector magnetic fields from
materials that are sensitive to applied DC magnetic fields. Here, we propose a
method to measure vector DC magnetic fields using perfectly aligned NV centers

of linearly polarized microwave fields to induce Rabi oscillation as a
reference and estimated the azimuthal angle of the target fields from the Rabi
frequency. We further demonstrate the potential of our method to improve

semi-discretization in space for the symmetrized variational formulation is
proposed and its area (or mass) conservation and energy dissipation are proved.
The semi-discretization is then discretized in time by either an implicit
structural-preserving scheme (SP-PFEM) which preserves the area in the
discretized level or a semi-implicit energy-stable method (ES-PFEM) which needs
only solve a linear system at each time step. Under a relatively simple and

Furthermore, our GLF modules use global semantic information of interesting

paper evaluates two coordinated TXOP sharing strategies: coordinated time

significant improvement in terms of the WLAN throughput, it lays the groundwork
to implement coordinated SR (c-SR) techniques. To evaluate the performance of
c-TDMA/SR, we propose a fair scheduler able to select the best subset of
parallel transmissions in WLAN deployments, as well as the appropriate power
levels to be used by APs and stations (STAs), leading to maximum performance.
The results obtained for c-TDMA/SR show significant throughput gains compared
with c-TDMA, with values higher than 140% in 90% of the considered scenarios.

scrutiny as the amount of experimental data and theoretical simulations is
increasing. To extend the commonly accepted yet simplifying and approximate
picture of transport effects taking place in systems with spatially varying
magnetization, it is important to understand the transport properties of
building blocks for spin textures $-$ the homochiral spin-spiral states. In
this work, by referring to phenomenological symmetry arguments based on the
gradient expansion, and explicit calculations within the Kubo framework, we
study the transport properties of various types of spin-spirals in a
two-dimensional model with strong spin-orbit interaction. In particular, we
focus on the contributions to the magnetoconductivity, the planar Hall effect
and the anomalous Hall effect, which are sensitive to the sense of chirality of
the spiral states. We analyze the emergence, symmetry, and microscopic
properties of the resulting chiral magnetoconductivity, chiral planar Hall
effect, and chiral Hall effect in terms of spin-spiral propagation direction,
cone angle, spiral pitch, and disorder strength. Our findings suggest that the
presence of spin-spiral states in magnets can be readily detected in various
types of magnetotransport setups. Moreover, the sizable magnitude of chiral
contributions to the conductivity of skyrmions estimated from homochiral
spirals implies that chiral, as opposed to topological, magnetotransport can
play a prominent role for the detection of non-trivial spin textures.

for high energy and density (HED) physics experiments. Primary X-ray which is
attenuated by the object offers density information of the object. For a thick
metal object with area density as high as 150 g/cm2, the rest part of primary
X-ray which passes through the object may drowned in scattered X-ray fog. It
seriously limits accuracy of density quantification. In this research, an
online scatter estimation method is newly designed which can be easily arranged
by putting an additional slit collimator downstream of the general X-ray
radiography layout. The basic ideal of this method is that the proportion of
scatter and primary x-ray will be changed a lot when x-ray passes through a
slit like collimation, then scatter component is solvable with known the
collimation performance of the silt on scatter and primary x-ray. Monte Carlo
simulation shows that, with this method, evaluation error of average scatter is
less than 2% when object area density is as high as 200 g/cm2. In addition to
the average scatter, an accelerated Monte Carlo method is developed to obtain
scatter distribution in iterative reconstruction. By employing the Genetic
algorithm as an optimizer, reconstruction can be done by searching a density
which projection with scatter best matches experimental result. This
reconstruction method requires neither a priori-knowledge such as mass
restriction nor regularization. Simulations show that for France Test Object

basically covers the real density.

number of balls of the same value. Initially, a ball from some basket is chosen

to be replaced by some $2$ balls from some baskets. Which baskets to take
depend only on the ball to be replaced and they are decided in advance. Given
some $n$, the object of the game is to find the maximum possible sum of values
$g(n)$ for a table of $n$ balls.
  In this article, the sequence $g(n)/n$ for $n=1,2,\dots$ will be shown to
converge to a growth rate $\lambda$. Furthermore, this value $\lambda$ is also
the rate of a structure called pseudo-loop and the solution of a rather simple
linear program. The structure and the linear program are closely related, e.g.
a solution of the linear program gives a pseudo-loop with the rate $\lambda$ in
linear time of the number of baskets, and vice versa with the pseudo-loop
giving a solution to the dual linear program. A method to test in quadratic
time whether a given $\lambda_0$ is smaller than $\lambda$ is provided to
approximate $\lambda$. When the values of the balls are all rational, we can
compute the precise value of $\lambda$ in cubic time, using the quadratic time
rate test algorithm and the binary search with a special condition to stop.
Four proofs of the limit $\lambda$ are given: one just uses the relation
between the baskets, one uses pseudo-loops, one uses the linear program and one
uses Fekete's lemma (the latest proof assumes a condition on the rule of
replacements).

without recourse to numerical fitting - the second-order elastic constants,
third-order bulk modulus, selected second- and third-order inner elastic

explicitly compute the Raman spectra of realistic, disordered

quantitatively capture: (i) the evolution of the measured Raman spectra with Sn
composition $x$, (ii) demonstrate explicitly that the presence of short-range
alloy disorder can significantly impact the shift coefficients $a$ and $b$ that

quantitative corneal transparency parameters from clinical spectral-domain OCT
images. To establish a representative dataset of normative transparency values
from healthy corneas.
  METHODS: SD-OCT images of 83 normal corneas (ages 22-50 years) from a
standard clinical device (RTVue-XR Avanti, Optovue Inc.) were processed. A
pre-processing procedure is applied first, including a derivative approach and
a PCA-based correction mask, to eliminate common central artifacts (i.e.,
apex-centered column saturation artifact and posterior stromal artifact) and
enable standardized analysis. The mean intensity stromal-depth profile is then
extracted over a 6-mm-wide corneal area and analyzed according to our
previously developed method deriving quantitative transparency parameters
related to the physics of light propagation in tissues, notably tissular
heterogeneity (Birge ratio; $B_r$), followed by the photon mean-free path
($l_s$) in homogeneous tissues (i.e., $B_r \sim 1$).
  RESULTS: After confirming stromal homogeneity ($B_r < 10$, IDR: 1.9-5.1), we
measured a median $l_s$ of 570 $\mu$m (IDR: 270-2400 $\mu$m). Considering
corneal thicknesses, this may be translated into a median fraction of
transmitted (coherent) light $T_{coh(stroma)}$ of 51$\%$ (IDR: 22-83$\%$). No
statistically significant correlation between transparency and age or thickness
was found.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm provides robust and quantitative measurement of
corneal transparency from standard clinical SD-OCT images. It yields lower
transparency values than previously reported, which may be attributed to our
method being exclusively sensitive to spatially coherent light. Excluding
images with central artifacts wider than 300 $\mu$m also raises our median
$T_{coh(stroma)}$ to 70$\%$ (IDR: 34-87$\%$).

two-dimensional (2D) semimetals hosting tilted and anisotropic Dirac cones in

Dirac cones are characterised by an absorption that is highly dependent on the
incident photon polarisation and frequency, and is tunable by changing the
Fermi level with a back-gate voltage. Type-II Dirac cones exhibit open Fermi
surfaces and large regions of the Brillouin zone where the valence and
conduction bands sit either above or below the Fermi level. As a consequence,
unlike their sub-critically tilted (type-I) counterparts, type-II Dirac cones
have many states that are Pauli blocked even when the Fermi level is tuned to
the level crossing point. We analyse the interplay of the tilt parameter with
the Fermi velocity anisotropy, demonstrating that the optical response of a
Dirac cone cannot be described by its tilt alone. As a special case of our
general theory we discuss the proposed 2D type-I semimetal 8-$Pmmn$ Borophene.
Guided by our in-depth analytics we develop an optical recipe to fully
characterise the tilt and Fermi velocity anisotropy of any 2D tilted Dirac cone
solely from its absorption spectrum. We expect our work to encourage Dirac cone
engineering as a major route to create gate-tunable thin-film polarisers.

However, prior works fail to incorporate fundamental domain knowledge into
graph semantics and thus ignore the correlations between atoms that have common
attributes but are not directly connected by bonds. To address these issues, we
construct a Chemical Element Knowledge Graph (KG) to summarize microscopic
associations between elements and propose a novel Knowledge-enhanced
Contrastive Learning (KCL) framework for molecular representation learning. KCL
framework consists of three modules. The first module, knowledge-guided graph
augmentation, augments the original molecular graph based on the Chemical
Element KG. The second module, knowledge-aware graph representation, extracts
molecular representations with a common graph encoder for the original
molecular graph and a Knowledge-aware Message Passing Neural Network (KMPNN) to
encode complex information in the augmented molecular graph. The final module
is a contrastive objective, where we maximize agreement between these two views
of molecular graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrated that KCL obtained
superior performances against state-of-the-art baselines on eight molecular
datasets. Visualization experiments properly interpret what KCL has learned
from atoms and attributes in the augmented molecular graphs. Our codes and data

frequent non-convergence problems like the most common implementations of
maximum likelihood estimators of the log-binomial model. However, using a
Poisson distribution to model a binary outcome may seem counterintuitive.
Methodological papers have often presented this as a good approximation to the
more natural binomial distribution. In this paper, we provide an alternative
perspective to the robust Poisson method based on the semiparametric theory.
This perspective highlights that the robust Poisson method does not require
assuming a Poisson distribution for the outcome. In fact, the method only
assumes a log-linear relationship between the risk/prevalence of the outcome
and the explanatory variables. This assumption and consequences of its
violation are discussed. Suggestions to reduce the risk of violating the
modeling assumption are also provided. Additionally, we discuss and contrast

information processing. However, it was proposed recently that these properties
are generic for objects, the so-called saturons, that attain the maximal
entropy permitted by unitarity. In the present paper, we verify this connection
within a renormalizable $SU(N)$ invariant theory. We show that the spectrum of
the theory contains a tower of bubbles representing bound states of $SU(N)$
Goldstones. Despite the absence of gravity, a saturated bound state exhibits a
striking correspondence with a black hole: Its entropy is given by the
Bekenstein-Hawking formula; semi-classically, the bubble evaporates at a
thermal rate with a temperature equal to its inverse radius; the information
retrieval time is equal to Page's time. The correspondence goes through a
trans-theoretic entity of Poincar\'{e} Goldstone. The black hole/saturon
correspondence has important implications for black hole physics, both
fundamental and observational.

certain domain-based requirements that can be expressed as constraints (e.g.,
safety-critical constraints in autonomous driving systems). Such constraints
are often handled by including them in a regularization term, while learning a
model. This approach, however, does not guarantee 100% satisfaction of the
constraints: it only reduces violations of the constraints on the training set
rather than ensuring that the predictions by the model will always adhere to
them. In this paper, we present a framework for learning models that provably
fulfil the constraints under all circumstances (i.e., also on unseen data). To
achieve this, we cast learning as a maximum satisfiability problem, and solve
it using a novel SaDe algorithm that combines constraint satisfaction with
gradient descent. We compare our method against regularization based baselines
on linear models and show that our method is capable of enforcing different
types of domain constraints effectively on unseen data, without sacrificing
predictive performance.

difficulties within the path integral formalism, by adapting the anomalous Ward
identities to the EFT context. Our results are very generic, and when applied
to axion models, they reproduce the non-intuitive couplings between the massive
SM gauge fields and the axion. Altogether, this provides an efficient
formalism, paving the way for a systematic and consistent methodology to build
entire EFTs involving anomalous symmetries, as required for axion or ALP
searches.

reduction letting the layer thickness tend to zero proportional to the scale
parameter $\epsilon$. A crucial point is the identification of scale limits of
functions $v_{\epsilon}$ in subsets of function spaces characterized by uniform
a priori estimates with respect to $\epsilon$, arising for solutions of
differential equations in heterogeneous media with thin layers, e.g., of a
Navier-Stokes system, models in linear elasticity, or problems with
fluid-structure interaction. Often in problems from continuum mechanics, in a
first step, the symmetric gradients of arising vector fields can be controlled
and Korn's inequality in porous layers is required to estimate the gradients,
such that crucial constants do not depend on $\epsilon$. Controllable
pore-filling extension are constructed and, thus, the analysis is reduced to a
fixed basic domain. The proof of the required Korn-inequalities for porous thin
layers, formulated with respect to $L^p$-spaces, is based on these
constructions. Also, the investigation of compactness with respect to two-scale
convergence and the characterization of the scale limits is strongly based on
the extension theorem and the Korn-inequalities. To illustrate the range of

compression efficiency for point clouds. However, it still leads to serious
attribute compression artifacts, especially under low bitrate scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Attention Network (MS-GAT) to remove
the artifacts of point cloud attributes compressed by G-PCC. We first construct
a graph based on point cloud geometry coordinates and then use the Chebyshev
graph convolutions to extract features of point cloud attributes. Considering
that one point may be correlated with points both near and far away from it, we
propose a multi-scale scheme to capture the short- and long-range correlations
between the current point and its neighboring and distant points. To address
the problem that various points may have different degrees of artifacts caused
by adaptive quantization, we introduce the quantization step per point as an
extra input to the proposed network. We also incorporate a weighted graph
attentional layer into the network to pay special attention to the points with
more attribute artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attribute artifacts removal method for G-PCC. We validate the effectiveness of
our method over various point clouds. Objective comparison results show that
our proposed method achieves an average of 9.74% BD-rate reduction compared
with Predlift and 10.13% BD-rate reduction compared with RAHT. Subjective

systems from presentation attacks. Existing face anti-spoofing datasets lack
diversity due to the insufficient identity and insignificant variance, which
limits the generalization ability of FAS model. In this paper, we propose Dual
Spoof Disentanglement Generation (DSDG) framework to tackle this challenge by
""anti-spoofing via generation"". Depending on the interpretable factorized
latent disentanglement in Variational Autoencoder (VAE), DSDG learns a joint
distribution of the identity representation and the spoofing pattern
representation in the latent space. Then, large-scale paired live and spoofing
images can be generated from random noise to boost the diversity of the
training set. However, some generated face images are partially distorted due
to the inherent defect of VAE. Such noisy samples are hard to predict precise
depth values, thus may obstruct the widely-used depth supervised optimization.
To tackle this issue, we further introduce a lightweight Depth Uncertainty
Module (DUM), which alleviates the adverse effects of noisy samples by depth
uncertainty learning. DUM is developed without extra-dependency, thus can be
flexibly integrated with any depth supervised network for face anti-spoofing.
We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on five popular benchmarks
and achieve state-of-the-art results under both intra- and inter- test
settings. The codes are available at

inclusion of wave reflection have a significant impact on Alfv\'en wave

terms, the constraint structure looks quite different from that of general
relativity (GR) but we have recently found that ""there exists the case where we
can recover the same number of degrees of freedom as in GR"", in a rather
general set-up. In this paper, we study its Lagrangian perspectives and examine
the full diffeomorphism (Diff) symmetry and its associated conservation laws in
Horava gravity. Surprisingly, we find that the full Diff symmetry in the action
can also be recovered when a certain condition, called ""super-condition"", which
super-selects the Lorentz-symmetric sector in Horava gravity, is satisfied.
This indicates that the broken Lorentz symmetry, known as
""foliation-preserving"" Diff, is just an ""apparent"" symmetry of the Horava
gravity action and rather its ""full action symmetry can be as large as the Diff
in GR "". The super-condition exactly corresponds to the tertiary constraint in
Hamiltonian formalism which is the second-class constraint and provides a
non-trivial realization of the Lorentz symmetry otherwise being absent
apparently. From the recovered Lorentz symmetry in the action, we obtain the
conservation laws with the Noether currents as in covariant theories. The
general formula for the conserved Noether charges reproduces the mass of
four-dimensional static black holes with an ""arbitrary"" cosmological constant
in Horava gravity, and is independent of ambiguities associated with the choice
of asymptotic boundaries. We also discuss several challenging problems,

quite popular. The significant computational complexity of matching vehicles to
combinations of requests has meant that traditional ride pooling approaches are
myopic in that they do not consider the impact of current matches on future
value for vehicles/drivers. Recently, Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming
(NeurADP) has employed value decomposition with Approximate Dynamic Programming
(ADP) to outperform leading approaches by considering the impact of an
individual agent's (vehicle) chosen actions on the future value of that agent.
However, in order to ensure scalability and facilitate city-scale ride pooling,
NeurADP completely ignores the impact of other agents actions on individual
agent/vehicle value. As demonstrated in our experimental results, ignoring the
impact of other agents actions on individual value can have a significant
impact on the overall performance when there is increased competition among
vehicles for demand. Our key contribution is a novel mechanism based on
computing conditional expectations through joint conditional probabilities for
capturing dependencies on other agents actions without increasing the
complexity of training or decision making. We show that our new approach,

up to 9.76% in terms of overall requests served, which is a significant

FPM-based methods use cross-entropy (CE) to evaluate the foreground prediction
map and to guide the learning of generator. We argue for using activation value
to achieve more efficient learning. It is based on the experimental observation
that, for a trained network, CE converges to zero when the foreground mask
covers only part of the object region. While activation value increases until
the mask expands to the object boundary, which indicates that more object areas
can be learned by using activation value. In this paper, we propose a
Background Activation Suppression (BAS) method. Specifically, an Activation Map
Constraint module (AMC) is designed to facilitate the learning of generator by
suppressing the background activation value. Meanwhile, by using the foreground
region guidance and the area constraint, BAS can learn the whole region of the
object. In the inference phase, we consider the prediction maps of different
categories together to obtain the final localization results. Extensive
experiments show that BAS achieves significant and consistent improvement over

forward solvers involving discretization and simplified representations of the
underlying physics. As a result, forward modeling errors are inevitable. In
practice, such model errors tend to be either completely ignored, which leads
to biased and over-confident inversion results, or only partly taken into
account using restrictive Gaussian assumptions. Here, we rely on deep
generative neural networks to learn problem-specific low-dimensional
probabilistic representations of the discrepancy between high-fidelity and
low-fidelity forward solvers. These representations are then used to
probabilistically invert for the model error jointly with the target
geophysical property field, using the computationally-cheap, low-fidelity
forward solver. To this end, we combine a Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC)
inversion algorithm with a trained convolutional neural network of the spatial
generative adversarial network (SGAN) type, whereby at each MCMC step, the
simulated low-fidelity forward response is corrected using a proposed
model-error realization. Considering the crosshole ground-penetrating radar
traveltime tomography inverse problem, we train SGAN networks on traveltime
discrepancy images between: (1) curved-ray (high fidelity) and straight-ray
(low fidelity) forward solvers; and (2) finite-difference-time-domain (high
fidelity) and straight-ray (low fidelity) forward solvers. We demonstrate that
the SGAN is able to learn the spatial statistics of the model error and that
suitable representations of both the subsurface model and model error can be
recovered by MCMC. In comparison with inversion results obtained when model
errors are either ignored or approximated by a Gaussian distribution, we find
that our method has lower posterior parameter bias and better explains the

information at multiple scales across the two modalities. Previous approaches
tend to apply the multi-scale and multi-modal fusion separately via local
operations, which fails to capture long-range dependencies. Here we propose a
transformer-based network to address this issue. Our proposed architecture is
composed of two modules: a transformer-based within-modality feature
enhancement module (TWFEM) and a transformer-based feature fusion module
(TFFM). TFFM conducts a sufficient feature fusion by integrating features from
multiple scales and two modalities over all positions simultaneously. TWFEM
enhances feature on each scale by selecting and integrating complementary
information from other scales within the same modality before TFFM. We show
that transformer is a uniform operation which presents great efficacy in both
feature fusion and feature enhancement, and simplifies the model design.
Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our

  Technique with Contrastive Regularization Mechanism","Want to improve the methodology",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reducing the radiation exposure for patients in Total-body CT scans has
attracted extensive attention in the medical imaging community. Given the fact
that low radiation dose may result in increased noise and artifacts, which
greatly affected the clinical diagnosis. To obtain high-quality Total-body
Low-dose CT (LDCT) images, previous deep-learning-based research work has
introduced various network architectures. However, most of these methods only
adopt Normal-dose CT (NDCT) images as ground truths to guide the training of
the denoising network. Such simple restriction leads the model to less
effectiveness and makes the reconstructed images suffer from over-smoothing
effects. In this paper, we propose a novel intra-task knowledge transfer method
that leverages the distilled knowledge from NDCT images to assist the training
process on LDCT images. The derived architecture is referred to as the
Teacher-Student Consistency Network (TSC-Net), which consists of the teacher
network and the student network with identical architecture. Through the
supervision between intermediate features, the student network is encouraged to
imitate the teacher network and gain abundant texture details. Moreover, to
further exploit the information contained in CT scans, a contrastive
regularization mechanism (CRM) built upon contrastive learning is
introduced.CRM performs to pull the restored CT images closer to the NDCT
samples and push far away from the LDCT samples in the latent space. In
addition, based on the attention and deformable convolution mechanism, we
design a Dynamic Enhancement Module (DEM) to improve the network transformation
capability.

  and reducing the contrast number simultaneously with deep learning","27 pages,11 figures. Submitted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose: To propose a novel deep learning-based method called RG-Net
(reconstruction and generation network) for highly accelerated MR parametric
mapping by undersampling k-space and reducing the acquired contrast number
simultaneously.
  Methods: The proposed framework consists of a reconstruction module and a
generative module. The reconstruction module reconstructs MR images from the
acquired few undersampled k-space data with the help of a data prior. The
generative module then synthesizes the remaining multi-contrast images from the
reconstructed images, where the exponential model is implicitly incorporated
into the image generation through the supervision of fully sampled labels. The
RG-Net was evaluated on the T1\r{ho} mapping data of knee and brain at
different acceleration rates. Regional T1\r{ho} analysis for cartilage and the
brain was performed to access the performance of RG-Net.
  Results: RG-Net yields a high-quality T1\r{ho} map at a high acceleration
rate of 17. Compared with the competing methods that only undersample k-space,
our framework achieves better performance in T1\r{ho} value analysis. Our
method also improves quality of T1\r{ho} maps on patient with glioma.
  Conclusion: The proposed RG-Net that adopted a new strategy by undersampling
k-space and reducing the contrast number simultaneously for fast MR parametric
mapping, can achieve a high acceleration rate while maintaining good
reconstruction quality. The generative module of our framework can also be used
as an insert module in other fast MR parametric mapping methods.

match pixels in an unlabeled image to the semantics of the best fitting pixel
in a reference set. This way, we avoid pitfalls such as confirmation bias,
common in purely prediction-based pseudo-labeling. Since our method does not
require any architectural changes or accompanying networks, one can easily
insert it into existing frameworks. We achieve the same performance as a
standard fully supervised model on X-ray anatomy segmentation, albeit 95% fewer

imaging (GI) has received extensive attentions in recent years. Simultaneously,
GI is affected by the poor trade-off between sampling rate and imaging quality.
The traditional image reconstruction method in GI is to accumulate the action
result of each speckle and the corresponding bucket signal. We found that the
image reconstruction process of GI is very similar to the Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN), which is one of the deep learning algorithm. In this paper, we
proposed a novel method that effectively implements GI on the RNN architecture,
called GI-RNN. The state of each layer in RNN is determined by the output of
the previous layer and the input of this layer, and the output of the network
is the sum of all previous states. Therefore, we take the speckle of each
illumination and the corresponding bucket signal as the input of each layer,
and the output of the network is the sum of all previous speckle and bucket
signal, which is the image of the target. The testing results show that the
proposed method can achieve image reconstruction at a very low sampling rate
(0.38$\%$). Moreover, we compare GI-RNN with traditional GI algorithm and
compressed sensing algorithm. The results of different targets show that GI-RNN
is 6.61 dB higher than compressed sensing algorithm and 12.58 dB higher than
traditional GI algorithm on average. In our view, the proposed method makes an
important step to applications of GI.

long been a challenging problem. The conventional search method can hardly
satisfy the real-time demand during high dynamics air combat scenarios. The
reinforcement learning (RL) method can significantly shorten the decision time
via using neural networks. However, the sparse reward problem limits its
convergence speed and the artificial prior experience reward can easily deviate
its optimal convergent direction of the original task, which raises great
difficulties for the RL air combat application. In this paper, we propose a
homotopy-based soft actor-critic method (HSAC) which focuses on addressing
these problems via following the homotopy path between the original task with
sparse reward and the auxiliary task with artificial prior experience reward.
The convergence and the feasibility of this method are also proved in this
paper. To confirm our method feasibly, we construct a detailed 3D air combat
simulation environment for the RL-based methods training firstly, and we
implement our method in both the attack horizontal flight UCAV task and the
self-play confrontation task. Experimental results show that our method
performs better than the methods only utilizing the sparse reward or the
artificial prior experience reward. The agent trained by our method can reach
more than 98.3% win rate in the attack horizontal flight UCAV task and average
67.4% win rate when confronted with the agents trained by the other two
methods.

broad range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, recent research efforts
have been made for adapting these models for different application domains.
Along this line, existing domain-oriented models have primarily followed the
vanilla BERT architecture and have a straightforward use of the domain corpus.
However, domain-oriented tasks usually require accurate understanding of domain
phrases, and such fine-grained phrase-level knowledge is hard to be captured by
existing pre-training scheme. Also, the word co-occurrences guided semantic
learning of pre-training models can be largely augmented by entity-level
association knowledge. But meanwhile, by doing so there is a risk of
introducing noise due to the lack of groundtruth word-level alignment. To
address the above issues, we provide a generalized domain-oriented approach,
which leverages auxiliary domain knowledge to improve the existing pre-training
framework from two aspects. First, to preserve phrase knowledge effectively, we
build a domain phrase pool as auxiliary training tool, meanwhile we introduce
Adaptive Hybrid Masked Model to incorporate such knowledge. It integrates two
learning modes, word learning and phrase learning, and allows them to switch
between each other. Second, we introduce Cross Entity Alignment to leverage
entity association as weak supervision to augment the semantic learning of
pre-trained models. To alleviate the potential noise in this process, we
introduce an interpretable Optimal Transport based approach to guide alignment
learning. Experiments on four domain-oriented tasks demonstrate the superiority
of our framework.

strengths in excellent agreement with existing experiments and theoretical
calculations characterizing direct excitation. In particular, an exciton

structure in a fatband representation shows that the lowest optical transition
of anatase TiO$_2$ consists of excitons originating from the mixing of direct
transitions within band pairs running parallel to the $\Gamma -Z $ direction in
the tetragonal Brillouin zone. This implies a strong spatial localization of
excitons in the $xy$ plane of the lattice. This investigation highlights the

a methodological framework for causal inference, using Granger causality
analysis, and injury severity classification of traffic crashes, occurring on
interstates, with different machine learning techniques including decision
trees (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep
neural network (DNN). The data used in this study were obtained for traffic
crashes on all interstates across the state of Texas from a period of six years
between 2014 and 2019. The output of the proposed severity classification
approach includes three classes for fatal and severe injury (KA) crashes,
non-severe and possible injury (BC) crashes, and property damage only (PDO)
crashes. While Granger Causality helped identify the most influential factors
affecting crash severity, the learning-based models predicted the severity
classes with varying performance. The results of Granger causality analysis
identified the speed limit, surface and weather conditions, traffic volume,
presence of workzones, workers in workzones, and high occupancy vehicle (HOV)
lanes, among others, as the most important factors affecting crash severity.
The prediction performance of the classifiers yielded varying results across
the different classes. Specifically, while decision tree and random forest
classifiers provided the greatest performance for PDO and BC severities,
respectively, for the KA class, the rarest class in the data, deep neural net
classifier performed superior than all other algorithms, most likely due to its
capability of approximating nonlinear models. This study contributes to the

2020 (pandemic) from the subreddits communities associated with eight
universities. We applied the pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training

leveraged the relational information among posted messages to train a graph

  Results: The results suggest that the odds of negative sentiments in 2020

with the previously proposed Align-Refine non-autoregressive decoding method
and its improved versions. The method performs a few refinement steps, where
each step shares a transformer decoder that attends to both text features
(extracted from alignments) and audio features, and outputs complete updated
alignments. The transformer decoder is trained with the CTC loss which
facilitates parallel greedy decoding, and performs full-context attention to
capture label dependencies. We improve Align-Refine by introducing cascaded
encoder that captures more audio context before refinement, and alignment
augmentation which enforces learning label dependency. We show that,
conditioned on hypothesis alignments of a streaming RNN-T model, our method
obtains significantly more accurate recognition results than the first-pass
RNN-T, with only small amount of model parameters.

of an investor with tail concerns. The diagonal of the matrix contains the
Value-at-Risk of each asset in the portfolio and the off-diagonal the pairwise
Delta-CoVaR measures reflecting tail connections between assets. First, we
derive the conditions under which the associated quadratic risk function has a
closed-form solution. Second, we examine the relationship between portfolio
risk and eigenvector centrality. Third, we show that portfolio risk is not
necessarily increasing with respect to stock centrality. Forth, we demonstrate
under certain conditions that asset centrality increases the optimal weight
allocation of the asset to the portfolio. Overall, our empirical study
indicates that a network topology which exhibits low connectivity is
outperformed by high connectivity based on a Sharpe ratio test.

application developers must decide how many compute resources (e.g., number of
replicated containers) to assign to each microservice within an application.
This decision affects both (1) the dollar cost to the application developer and
(2) the end-to-end latency perceived by the application user. Today, individual
microservices are autoscaled independently by adding VMs whenever
per-microservice CPU or memory utilization crosses a configurable threshold.
However, an application user's end-to-end latency consists of time spent on
multiple microservices and each microservice might need a different number of
VMs to achieve an overall end-to-end latency.
  We present COLA, an autoscaler for microservice-based applications, which
collectively allocates VMs to microservices with a global goal of minimizing
dollar cost while keeping end-to-end application latency under a given target.
Using 5 open-source applications, we compared COLA to several utilization and
machine learning based autoscalers. We evaluate COLA across different compute
settings on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in which users manage compute
resources, GKE standard, and a new mode of operation in which the cloud
provider manages compute infrastructure, GKE Autopilot. COLA meets a desired
median or tail latency target on 53 of 63 workloads where it provides a cost
reduction of 19.3%, on average, over the next cheapest autoscaler. COLA is the
most cost effective autoscaling policy for 48 of these 53 workloads. The cost
savings from managing a cluster with COLA result in COLA paying for its
training cost in a few days. On smaller applications, for which we can
exhaustively search microservice configurations, we find that COLA is optimal
for 90% of cases and near optimal otherwise.

coherent topics validated by human experts. From these topics, a few are
relatively general and cover broad concepts, while the majority can be
precisely mapped to specific scientific effects or measurement techniques. The
topics also differ by ubiquity, with only three topics prevalent in almost 40

subset of the abstracts. These results demonstrate the ability of SeNMFk to
produce a layered and nuanced analysis of large scientific corpora.

  Security, VOL.21, No.12, December 2021",,,"cs.NI cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Abstraction applied in computer networking hides network details behind a
well-defined representation by building a model that captures an essential
aspect of the network system. Two current methods of representation are
available, one based on graph theory, where a network node is reduced to a
point in a graph, and the other the use of non-methodological iconic depictions
such as human heads, walls, towers or computer racks. In this paper, we adopt
an abstract representation methodology, the thinging machine (TM), proposed in
software engineering to model computer networks. TM defines a single coherent
network architecture and topology that is constituted from only five generic
actions with two types of arrows. Without loss of generality, this paper
applies TM to model the area of network monitoring in packet-mode transmission.
Complex network documents are difficult to maintain and are not guaranteed to
mirror actual situations. Network monitoring is constant monitoring for and
alerting of malfunctions, failures, stoppages or suspicious activities in a
network system. Current monitoring systems are built on ad hoc descriptions
that lack systemization. The TM model of monitoring presents a theoretical
foundation integrated with events and behavior descriptions. To investigate TM
modeling s feasibility, we apply it to an existing computer network in a
Kuwaiti enterprise to create an integrated network system that includes
hardware, software and communication facilities. The final specifications point
to TM modeling s viability in the computer networking field.

and the abilities of massive data storage, processing and query become
technical challenges. To solve the problem, a Hadoop cloud platform is
proposed. With the help of time and workload genetic algorithm (TWLGA), the
data processing platform provides the work of one node to share with others,
which not only raises efficiency of one single node, but also provides the
compatibility support to reduce the possible risk of software and hardware. In
the experiment, a Hadoop cluster platform with TWLGA scheduling algorithm is
built, and the performance of the platform is tested. The results show that the
Hadoop cloud platform is suitable for big data processing of the IOT sensor
network.

for Steenrod algebra, has been systematically studied for $t\leq 4.$ The
present paper is devoted to the investigation of the structure of $\mathbb

relation between the minimal sets of $\mathcal A_2$-generators of the algebras
$P_{t-1}$ and $P_{t}$ in the case $t=5$ and degree $n_s$. As applications, we
obtain the dimension of $\mathbb Z_2\otimes_{\mathcal A_2} P_6$ in the generic
