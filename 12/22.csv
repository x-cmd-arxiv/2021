individuals to overcome unfavorable classification outcomes from automated
decision-making systems. Recourse recommendations should ideally be robust to
reasonably small uncertainty in the features of the individual seeking
recourse. In this work, we formulate the adversarially robust recourse problem
and show that recourse methods that offer minimally costly recourse fail to be
robust. We then present methods for generating adversarially robust recourse
for linear and for differentiable classifiers. Finally, we show that
regularizing the decision-making classifier to behave locally linearly and to
rely more strongly on actionable features facilitates the existence of
adversarially robust recourse.

estimating the monthly output gap and studying the response of GDP to a

  First, we give a general necessary condition for the existence of a physical
transformation between quantum states, obtained using a recently introduced
resource monotone based on the Hilbert projective metric. In all affine quantum
resource theories (e.g. coherence, asymmetry, imaginarity) as well as in
entanglement distillation, we show that the monotone provides a necessary and
sufficient condition for one-shot resource convertibility under
resource-non-generating operations, and hence no better restrictions on all
probabilistic protocols are possible. We use the monotone to establish improved
bounds on the performance of both one-shot and many-copy probabilistic resource
distillation protocols.
  Complementing this approach, we introduce a general method for bounding
achievable probabilities in resource transformations under
resource-non-generating maps through a family of convex optimisation problems.
We show it to tightly characterise single-shot probabilistic distillation in
broad types of resource theories, allowing an exact analysis of the trade-offs
between the probabilities and errors in distilling maximally resourceful
states. We demonstrate the usefulness of both of our approaches in the study of
quantum entanglement distillation.

recovering a finite number of parameters describing the structure of an unknown

a regularizing inverse operator by using a dataset of input-output pairs of the
forward model rely on deep learning techniques. In these approaches, a neural
network is trained to predict the value of the sought parameters directly from
the data. In this paper, we show that these methods provide suboptimal results
when the topology of the parameter space is strictly coarser than the Euclidean
one. To overcome this issue, we propose a two-step strategy for approximating a
regularizing inverse operator by means of a neural network, which works under
general topological conditions. First, we embed the parameters into a subspace
of a low-dimensional Euclidean space; second, we use a neural network to
approximate a homeomorphism between the subspace and the image of the parameter
space through the forward operator. The parameters are then retrieved by
applying the inverse of the embedding to the network predictions. The results
are shown for the problem of X-ray imaging of solar flares with data from the
Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays. In this case, the parameter space is
a family of Moebius strips that collapse into a point. Our simulation studies
show that the use of a neural network for predicting the parameters directly
from the data yields systematic errors due to the non-Euclidean topology of the
parameter space. The proposed strategy overcomes the topological issues and
furnishes stable and accurate reconstructions.

that has so far been classified as a luminous rapidly evolving broad-lined Ic
supernova (SN Ic-BL), and re-construct its post-peak bolometric light curve. We
find that the luminosity of the post-peak bolometric light curve of iPTF 16asu
is about 3 times that of the pseudo-bolometric light curve derived in the
literature, and the extrapolated peak luminosity exceeds $\sim 10^{44}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, which is higher than the threshold of superluminous SNe (SLSNe). We
then use the $^{56}$Ni model and the magnetar plus $^{56}$Ni model to fit the
multi-band light curves of iPTF 16asu, and construct the theoretical bolometric
light curve using the best-fitting theoretical multi-band light curves. We find
that the magnetar plus $^{56}$Ni model can account for the photometry of
iPTF~16asu, and the peak luminosity of its theoretical bolometric light curve
is $\sim 1.06\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We suggest that iPTF~16asu and
similar SNe (e.g., SN 2018gep) constitute the class of rapidly evolving SLSNe

Remote sensing using airborne LiDAR can be used to perform these measurements

above-ground carbon stocks directly from airborne LiDAR point clouds. We devise
different neural network architectures for point cloud regression and evaluate
them on remote sensing data of areas for which AGB estimates have been obtained
from field measurements in the Danish national forest inventory. Our adaptation
of Minkowski convolutional neural networks for regression gave the best
results. The deep neural networks produced significantly more accurate wood

[CII], observed within the SOFIA legacy program FEEDBACK, and the $^{12}$CO and
$^{13}$CO (3$\to$2) lines, obtained with APEX. In addition we used HI data from
the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. Two radiative transfer models were used to
fit the observed data. A line profile analysis with the 1D non-LTE radiative
transfer code SimLine proves that the CO emission cannot stem from a
spherically symmetric molecular cloud configuration. With a two-layer
multicomponent model, we then quantified the amount of warm background and cold
foreground gas. There is a deficit of CO emission along the line-of-sight
toward the center of the HII region which indicates that the HII region is
associated with a flattened molecular cloud. Self-absorption in the CO line may
hide signatures of infalling and expanding molecular gas. The [CII] emission
arises from an expanding [CII] bubble and from the PDRs. A significant part of
[CII] emission is absorbed in a cool (~60-100 K), low-density (<500 cm$^{-3}$)
atomic foreground layer with a thickness of a few parsec. We propose that the
RCW 120 HII region formed in a flattened molecular cloud and is now bursting
out of its parental cloud. The compressed surrounding molecular layer formed a
torus around the spherically expanding HII bubble. This scenario can possibly
be generalized for other HII bubbles and would explain the observed ""flat""
structure of molecular clouds associated with HII bubbles. We suggest that the
[CII] absorption observed in many star-forming regions is at least partly
caused by low-density, cool, HI-envelopes surrounding the molecular clouds.

frictional elastic disks, that is exposed to externally applied time-dependent
shear stress in a planar Couette geometry. We concentrate on the external
forcing that produces intermittent dynamics of stick-slip type. In this regime,
the top wall remains almost at rest until the applied stress becomes
sufficiently large, and then it slips. We focus on the evolution of the system
as it approaches a slip event. Our main finding is that there are two distinct
groups of measures describing system behavior before a slip event. The first
group consists of global measures defined as system-wide averages at a fixed
time. Typical examples of measures in this group are averages of the normal or
tangent forces acting between the particles, system size and number of contacts
between the particles. These measures do not seem to be sensitive to an
approaching slip event. On average, they tend to increase linearly with the
force pulling the spring. The second group consists of the time-dependent
measures that quantify the evolution of the system on a micro (particle) or
mesoscale. Measures in this group first quantify the temporal differences
between two states and only then aggregate them to a single number. For
example, Wasserstein distance quantitatively measures the changes of the force
network as it evolves in time while the number of broken contacts quantifies
the evolution of the contact network. The behavior of the measures in the
second group changes dramatically before a slip event starts. They increase
rapidly as a slip event approaches, indicating a significant increase in
fluctuations of the system before a slip event is triggered.

galaxies in large surveys. However, the demands of ongoing and future
large-scale cosmology surveys place very stringent limits on the redshift
performance that are difficult to meet. A new approach to meet this precision
need is forward modelling, which is underpinned by realistic simulations. In
the work presented here, we use simulations to study the sensitivity of
redshift distributions to the underlying galaxy population demographics. We do
this by varying the redshift evolving parameters of the Schechter function for
two galaxy populations, star-forming and quenched galaxies. Each population is
characterised by eight parameters. We find that the redshift distribution of
shallow surveys, such as SDSS, is mainly sensitive to the parameters for
quenched galaxies. However, for deeper surveys such as DES and HSC, the
star-forming parameters have a stronger impact on the redshift distribution.
Specifically, the slope of the characteristic magnitude, $a_\mathrm{M}$, for
star-forming galaxies has overall the strongest impact on the redshift
distribution. Decreasing $a_\mathrm{M}$ by 148 per cent (its given uncertainty)
shifts the mean redshift by ${\sim} 45$ per cent. We explore which combination
of colour and magnitude measurements are most sensitive to $a_\mathrm{M}$ and
we find that each colour-magnitude pair studied is similarly affected by a
modification of $a_\mathrm{M}$.

adjacent parts that move relative to each other must be connected by a joint.
To leverage this insight, we model the object parts in 3D as ellipsoids, which
allows us to identify joints. We combine this explicit representation with an

mean-field spin glass models with Ising spins under weak external fields. We
prove that at high temperature, there are three sub-regimes concerning the
strength of external field $h \approx \rho N^{-\alpha}$ with $\rho,\alpha\in
(0,\infty)$. In the super-critical regime $\alpha < 1/4$, the variance of the
log-partition function is $\approx N^{1-4\alpha}$. In the critical regime
$\alpha = 1/4$, the fluctuation is of constant order but depends on $\rho$.
Whereas, in the sub-critical regime $\alpha>1/4$, the variance is $\Theta(1)$
and does not depend on $\rho$. We explicitly express the asymptotic mean and
variance in all three regimes and prove Gaussian central limit theorems. Our
proofs mainly follow two approaches. One utilizes quadratic coupling and
Guerra's interpolation scheme for Gaussian disorder, extending to many other
spin glass models. However, this approach can prove the CLT only at very high
temperatures. The other one is a cluster-based approach for general symmetric
disorders, first used in the seminal work of Aizenman, Lebowitz, and
Ruelle~(Comm.~Math.~Phys.~112 (1987), no.~1, 3--20) for the zero external field
case. It was believed that this approach does not work if the external field is
present. We show that if the external field is present but not too strong, it
still works with a new cluster structure. In particular, we prove the CLT up to
the critical temperature in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model when $\alpha
\ge 1/4$. We further address the generality of this cluster-based approach.
Specifically, we give similar results for the multi-species SK model and

complex algorithms and redundant hardware, which would render traditional
physical layer security (PLS) techniques unsuitable for use with
resource-constrained communication systems. This work investigates a
waveform-defined security (WDS) framework, which differs fundamentally from
traditional PLS techniques used in today's systems. The framework is not
dependent on channel conditions such as signal power advantage and channel
state information (CSI). Therefore, the framework is more reliable than channel
dependent beamforming and artificial noise (AN) techniques. In addition, the
framework is more than just increasing the cost of eavesdropping. By
intentionally tuning waveform patterns to weaken signal feature diversity and
enhance feature similarity, eavesdroppers will not be able to identify
correctly signal formats. The wrong classification of signal formats would
result in subsequent detection errors even when an eavesdropper uses
brute-force detection techniques. To get a robust WDS framework, three impact
factors, namely training data feature, oversampling factor and bandwidth
compression factor (BCF) offset, are investigated. An optimal WDS waveform
pattern is obtained at the end after a joint study of the three factors. To
ensure a valid eavesdropping model, artificial intelligence (AI) dependent
signal classifiers are designed followed by optimal performance achievable
signal detectors. To show the compatibility in available communication systems,
the WDS framework is successfully integrated in IEEE 802.11a with nearly no
adding computational complexity. Finally, a low-cost software-defined radio
(SDR) experiment is designed to verify the feasibility of the WDS framework in
resource-constrained communications.

Here, we enhance the underlying contact problem to a node-to-segment

is described by a quadratic inequality and is approximated by a sequence of
LCPs in each time step. These steps are performed in a reduced approximation
space, while the contact treatment itself can be achieved by the Craig-Bampton
method, which preserves the Lagrange multipliers and the nodal displacements at
the contact zone. We think, that if the contact area is small compared to the
overall structure, the reduction scheme performs very efficiently, since the
contact shape is entirely recovered. The performance of the resulting reduction
method is assessed on two 2D computational examples

Additionally, constructing (psuedo-)bolometric light curves rely on some
assumptions. In this paper, we use the multi-band broken power-law plus
$^{56}$Ni model to fit the multi-band light curves of the afterglows and the
SNe (SN~2001ke, SN~2013dx, and SN~2016jca) associated with three GRBs

the multi-band light curves of the three GRB-SNe (except for the late-time
$z-$band light curves of two events), indicating that the model is a reliable
model. The $^{56}$Ni masses we derive are higher than that in the literature.
This might be due to the fact that the $^{56}$Ni masses in the literature are
usually obtained by fitting the psuedo-bolometric light curves whose
luminosities are usually (significantly) underestimated. We suggest that the

instabilities in contractile gels. Here we report the observation of these four

controlled by two parameters: the concentrations of ATP and depletion agent. We
demonstrate that as the ATP concentration decreases, the concentration of
passive motors increases until the gel undergoes a gelation transition. At this
point, buckling is selected against bending, while global contraction is
favored over local ones. Our observations are coherent with a hydrodynamic
model of a viscoelastic active gel where the filaments are crosslinked with a

thus provides a unified view of spatial instabilities in cytoskeletal active

undergo a transition from a QCD-like phase, characterised by confinement and
chiral symmetry breaking, to a conformal phase, where the theory becomes
scale-invariant at large distances. In this paper, we discuss some properties
of a third phase, where spontaneously broken conformal symmetry is
characterised by its Goldstone boson, the dilaton. In this phase, which we
refer to as conformal dilaton phase, the massless pole corresponding to the
Goldstone boson guarantees that the conformal Ward identities are satisfied in
the infrared despite the other hadrons carrying mass. In particular, using
renormalisation group arguments in Euclidean space, we show that for massless
quarks the trace of the energy momentum tensor vanishes on all physical states
as a result of the fixed point. This implies the vanishing of the gluon
condensate and suggests that the scale breaking is driven by the quark
condensate which has implications for the cosmological constant. In addition
form factors obey an exact constraint for every hadron and are thus suitable
probes to identify this phase in the context of lattice Monte Carlo studies.
For this purpose we examine how the system behaves under explicit symmetry
breaking, via quark-mass and finite-volume deformations. The dilaton mass shows
hyperscaling under mass deformation, viz. $m_{D} = {\cal
O}(m_q^{1/(1+\gamma^*)})$. This provides another clean search pattern.

a minimal network of biopolymers, molecular motors, and crosslinkers exhibits
two distinct emergent behaviors depending on its composition, spontaneously

motors play a dual antagonistic role, fluidizing or stiffening the network
depending on the ATP concentration. By combining experiments, continuum theory,
and chemical kinetics, we identify how to assemble materials with targeted
activity and elasticity by setting the concentrations of each component. Active
and elastic stresses can be further manipulated in situ by light-induced pulses
of motor activity, controlling the solid-to-fluid transition. These results
highlight how cytoskeletal stresses regulate the self-organization of living

finally, H-bond symmetrization at ~18 GPa. This study investigates these 300 K
pressure-induced state changes in $\delta$ with ab initio calculations. H-bond
disordering in $\delta$ was modeled using supercell multi-configuration

(b) the pressure dependence of phonon frequencies, (c) 300 K compressibility,
(d) neutron diffraction pattern anomalies, and (e) compare ab initio bond

that: (a) proton ""disorder"" has a restricted meaning when applied to $\delta$.
Nevertheless, H-bonds are disordered between 0 and 8 GPa, and a gradual change
in H-bond configuration results in enhanced compressibility. (b) several
structural and vibrational anomalies at ~8 GPa are consistent with the
disappearance of a particular (HOC-12) H-bond configuration and its change into
another one (HOC-11*). (c) between 8-11 GPa, H-bond configuration (HOC-11*) is
generally ordered, at least in short- to mid-range scale. (d) between 11.5-18

resulting in decreased compressibility. In this pressure range, especially
approaching H-bond symmetrization at ~18 GPa, anharmonicity and tunneling

provide tools that can be used in practice to account for an imperfect beam
splitter, non-identical and non-unit detection efficiencies, dark counts and
other imperfections, to take finite statistical effects into account without
assuming that identical states are produced in all rounds, and optionally allow
one to remove the detector inefficiencies from the analysis. We demonstrate the
use of the proposed benchmark, non-classicality witness and measure using a
heralded single-photon source based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion.
We report on an average probability that a single photon is produced $\geq
55\%$ and an average measure of the Wigner negativity $\geq 0.004$ with a
confidence level of $1-10^{-10}$.

features of unsteady processes in plasmas, usually assuming light fluctuations
to be a proxy for the plasma density fluctuations. In this article, we
systematically compare high speed camera imaging with simultaneous measurements
of the plasma parameters -- plasma density, electron temperature, floating
potential -- in a modestly magnetized Argon plasma column at low pressure (1
mTorr, magnetic fields ranging from 160 to 640~G). The light emission was
filtered around $488\pm5$~nm, $750\pm5$~nm, $810\pm5$~nm. We show that the
light intensity cannot be interpreted as a proxy for the plasma density and
that the electron temperature cannot be ignored when interpreting high speed
imaging, both for the time-averaged profiles and for the fluctuations. The
features of plasma parameter fluctuations are investigated, with a focus on ion
acoustic waves (at frequency around 70 kHz) at low magnetic field and
low-frequency azimuthal waves (around a few kHz) at larger magnetic fields. An
excellent match is found between the high speed images fluctuations and an
Arrhenius law functional form which incorporates fluctuations of the plasma
density and of the electron temperature. These results explain the
discrepancies between ion saturation current and narrow-band imaging
measurements previously reported in the literature.

  with Cluster Ensembles",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper develops a data-driven approach to accurately predict the
restoration time of outages under different scales and factors. To achieve the
goal, the proposed method consists of three stages. First, given the
unprecedented amount of data collected by utilities, a sparse dictionary-based
ensemble spectral clustering (SDESC) method is proposed to decompose historical
outage datasets, which enjoys good computational efficiency and scalability.
Specifically, each outage sample is represented by a linear combination of a
small number of selected dictionary samples using a density-based method. Then,
the dictionary-based representation is utilized to perform the spectral
analysis to group the data samples with similar features into the same subsets.
In the second stage, a knowledge-transfer-added restoration time prediction
model is trained for each subset by combining weather information and
outage-related features. The transfer learning technology is introduced with
the aim of dealing with the underestimation problem caused by data imbalance in
different subsets, thus improving the model performance. Furthermore, to
connect unseen outages with the learned outage subsets, a t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding-based strategy is applied. The proposed method
fully builds on and is also tested on a large real-world outage dataset from a
utility provider with a time span of six consecutive years. The numerical
results validate that our method has high prediction accuracy while showing
good stability against real-world data limitations.

Transformer-based ASR model, with the intuition that the attention mechanisms

convolutional front-ends for prosodic and spectral features, showing that this
architectural choice yields better results than simple concatenation of such
pitch and voice quality features to mel-spectrogram filterbanks. Furthermore,
we find mean Word Error Rate relative reductions of up to 5.6% with the

lowering of HXR sources' altitude with increasing energy. The foot point of HXR
sources result from the direct interaction of non-thermal electron beams with
plasma in the lower part of the solar atmosphere, where the density increases
rapidly. Therefore, we can estimate the plasma density distribution along the
non-thermal electron beam directly from the observations of the altitude-energy
relation obtained for the HXR foot point sources. The relation's shape is
density-dependent and is also determined by the power-law distribution of
non-thermal electrons. Additionally, during the impulsive phase these
parameters may change dramatically. Thus, the interpretation of observed HXR
foot point sources' altitudes is not straightforward and needs detailed
numerical modelling of the electron precipitation process. The numerical model
was calculated using the hydrodynamic 1D model with an application of the
Fokker-Planck formalism for non-thermal beam precipitation. HXR data from
RHESSI were used to trace chromospheric density changes during a non-thermal
emission burst, in detail. We have found that the amount of mass that
evaporated from the chromosphere is in good agreement with the ranges obtained
from hydrodynamical modelling of a flaring loop, and from an analysis of
observed emission measure in the loop top, and with specific scaling laws.
Consistency between the obtained values shows that HXR images may provide an
important constraint for models - a mass of plasma that evaporated due to a
non-thermal electron beam depositing energy in the chromosphere. High-energy,
non-thermal sources' (above 20 keV in this case) positions fit the column
density changes obtained from the hydrodynamical model perfectly. Density
changes seem to be less affected by the electrons' spectral index.

precise definition of deconfinement. In large-$N$ gauge theories, evidence has
emerged recently that between confined and deconfined phases a
partially-deconfined phase can appear, in which only a subset of colours
deconfine. In the partially-deconfined phase, the centre symmetry is
spontaneously broken, raising the question of whether an order parameter exists
that can distinguish completely- and partially-deconfined phases. We present
two examples in gauge theories of global symmetries that are spontaneously
broken in the confined phase and preserved in the deconfined phase, and we show
that this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the partially-deconfined phase.
As a result, in these theories the transition from complete to partial
deconfinement is accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry.
The two examples are CP symmetry in $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills with a
massive gluino and theta-angle $\theta=\pi$, and chiral symmetry in a
strongly-coupled lattice gauge theory. For $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM we also present
numerical evidence that the same phenomenon occurs at finite $N \geq 30$. We
thus conjecture that global symmetries may provide order parameters to
distinguish completely and partially deconfined phases generically, including
at finite $N$.

local rules to accomplish learning in physical networks such as mechanical,
flow, or electrical networks. In contrast to certain natural neural networks,
however, such approaches have so far been restricted to the quasistatic limit,
where they learn on time scales slow compared to their physical relaxation.
This quasistatic constraint slows down learning, limiting the use of these
methods as machine learning algorithms, and potentially restricting physical
networks that could be used as learning platforms. Here we explore learning in
an electrical resistor network that implements coupled learning, both in the
lab and on the computer, at rates that range from slow to far above the
quasistatic limit. We find that up to a critical threshold in the ratio of the
learning rate to the physical rate of relaxation, learning speeds up without
much change of behavior or error. Beyond the critical threshold, the error
exhibits oscillatory dynamics but the networks still learn successfully.

formalism reduces this coordinate dependence to that of four particles
irrespective of the wave function's dimensionality, providing a promising path
to solve the many-body problem. Unfortunately, errors arise in this approach
because the 2-RDM cannot practically be constrained to guarantee that it
corresponds to a valid wave function. Here we approach this so-called
$N$-representability problem by expanding the 2-RDM in a complete basis of
two-electron wave functions and studying the matrix formed by the expansion
coefficients. This quantity, which we call the geminal density matrix (GDM), is
found to evolve in time by a unitary transformation that preserves
$N$-representability. This evolution law enables us to calculate eigenstates of
strongly correlated systems by a fictitious adiabatic evolution in which the
electron-electron interaction is slowly switched on. We show how this technique
is used to diagonalize atomic Hamiltonians, finding that the problem reduces to
the solution of $\sim N(N-1)/2$ two-electron eigenstates of the Helium atom on

Computed Tomography (CT). Spectral information acquired from these detectors
can be used to extract volumetric material composition maps of the object of
interest. If the materials and their spectral responses are known a priori, the
image reconstruction step is rather straightforward. If they are not known,
however, the maps as well as the responses need to be estimated jointly. A
conventional workflow in spectral CT involves performing volume reconstruction
followed by material decomposition, or vice versa. However, these methods
inherently suffer from the ill-posedness of the joint reconstruction problem.
To resolve this issue, we propose 'A Dictionary-based Joint reconstruction and
Unmixing method for Spectral Tomography' (ADJUST). Our formulation relies on
forming a dictionary of spectral signatures of materials common in CT and prior
knowledge of the number of materials present in an object. In particular, we
decompose the spectral volume linearly in terms of spatial material maps, a
spectral dictionary, and the indicator of materials for the dictionary
elements. We propose a memory-efficient accelerated alternating proximal
gradient method to find an approximate solution to the resulting bi-convex
problem. From numerical demonstrations on several synthetic phantoms, we
observe that ADJUST performs exceedingly well compared to other
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we address the robustness of ADJUST
against limited and noisy measurement patterns. The demonstration of the
proposed approach on a spectral micro-CT dataset shows its potential for
real-world applications. Code is available at

demonstrated theoretically, numerically, and experimentally with good

function of increasing E_ac at fixed frequency, the traditional boundary-driven
four streaming rolls created at a half-wave standing-wave resonance, transition
into two large streaming rolls. This nonlinear transition occurs because
friction heats up the fluid resulting in a temperature gradient, which spawns
an acoustic body force in the bulk that drives thermoacoustic streaming.

an Edge Device (ED) and an Edge Server (ES) received significant attention in
the past. Motivated by the fact that an increasing number of applications are
using Machine Learning (ML) inference, we study the problem of offloading
inference jobs by considering the following novel aspects: 1) in contrast to a
typical computational job, the processing time of an inference job depends on
the size of the ML model, and 2) recently proposed Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
for resource-constrained devices provide the choice of scaling the model size.
We formulate an assignment problem with the aim of maximizing the total
inference accuracy of n data samples available at the ED, subject to a time
constraint T on the makespan. We propose an approximation algorithm AMR2, and
prove that it results in a makespan at most 2T, and achieves a total accuracy
that is lower by a small constant from optimal total accuracy. As proof of
concept, we implemented AMR2 on a Raspberry Pi, equipped with MobileNet, and is
connected to a server equipped with ResNet, and studied the total accuracy and
makespan performance of AMR2 for image classification application.

wireless systems, the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) rely on arrays
of unit cells to control the scattering and reflection profiles of signals,
mitigating the propagation loss and multipath attenuation, and thereby
improving the coverage and spectral efficiency. In this paper, covert
communication is considered in the presence of the RIS. While there is an
ongoing transmission boosted by the RIS, both the intended receiver and an
eavesdropper individually try to detect this transmission using their own deep
neural network (DNN) classifiers. The RIS interaction vector is designed by
balancing two (potentially conflicting) objectives of focusing the transmitted
signal to the receiver and keeping the transmitted signal away from the
eavesdropper. To boost covert communications, adversarial perturbations are
added to signals at the transmitter to fool the eavesdropper's classifier while
keeping the effect on the receiver low. Results from different network
topologies show that adversarial perturbation and RIS interaction vector can be
jointly designed to effectively increase the signal detection accuracy at the
receiver while reducing the detection accuracy at the eavesdropper to enable
covert communications.

we discuss in detail how these corrections appear in theories containing at

potentially large trilinear coupling. We show how the occurrence of the large

the one-loop level, we also explicitly derive the two-loop corrections
containing the large logarithms. We point out in this context the importance of
choosing an on-shell-like renormalisation scheme. As exemplary applications, we
present results for the two-loop external-leg corrections for the decay of a
gluino into a scalar top quark and a top quark in the Minimal Supersymmetric

zeroth-order inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ZO-iALM) to solve black-box
optimization problems, which involve a composite (i.e., smooth+nonsmooth)
objective and functional constraints. Under a certain regularity condition
(also assumed by several existing works on FO methods), the query complexity of
our ZO-iALM is $\tilde{O}(d\varepsilon^{-3})$ to find an $\varepsilon$-KKT
point for problems with a nonconvex objective and nonconvex constraints, and
$\tilde{O}(d\varepsilon^{-2.5})$ for nonconvex problems with convex
constraints, where $d$ is the variable dimension. This appears to be the first
work that develops an iALM-based ZO method for functional constrained
optimization and meanwhile achieves query complexity results matching the
best-known FO complexity results up to a factor of $d$. With an extensive
experimental study, we show the effectiveness of our method. The applications
of our method span from classical optimization problems to practical machine
learning examples such as resource allocation in sensor networks and
adversarial example generation.

common primary interaction vertex or the same parent particle. One of the
processes capable of initiating identifiable CRE is an interaction of an
ultra-high energy (UHE) photon with the solar magnetic field which results in
an electron pair production and the subsequent synchrotron radiation. The
resultant electromagnetic cascade forms a very characteristic line-like front
of a very small width ($\sim$ meters), stretching from tens of thousands to
even many millions of kilometers. In this contribution we present the results
of applying a toy model to simulate detections of such CRE at the ground level
with an array of ideal detectors of different dimensions. The adopted approach
allows us to assess the CRE detection feasibility for a specific configuration
of a detector array. The process of initiation and propagation of an
electromagnetic cascade originated from an UHE photon passing near the Sun, as
well as the resultant particle distribution on ground, were simulated using the
CORSIKA program with the PRESHOWER option, both modified accordingly. The
studied scenario results in photons forming a cascade that extends even over
tens of millions of kilometers when it arrives at the top of the Earth's
atmosphere, and the photon energies span practically the whole cosmic ray
energy spectrum. The topology of the signal consists of very extended CRE
shapes, and the characteristic, very much elongated disk-shape of the particle
distribution on ground illustrates the potential for identification of CRE of
this type.

ensemble of molecular configurations continues to be a challenge. Recent
structural clustering methods have focused on the use of internal coordinates
due to the innate rotational and translational invariance of these features.
The vast number of possible internal coordinates necessitates a feature space
supervision step to make clustering tractable, but yields a protocol that can
be system type specific. Particle positions offer an appealing alternative to
internal coordinates, but suffer from a lack of rotational and translational
invariance, as well as a perceived insensitivity to regions of structural
dissimilarity. Here, we present a method, denoted shape-GMM, that overcomes the
shortcomings of particle positions using a weighted maximum likelihood (ML)
alignment procedure. This alignment strategy is then built into an expectation
maximization Gaussian mixture model (GMM) procedure to capture metastable
states in the free energy landscape. The resulting algorithm distinguishes
between a variety of different structures, including those indistinguishable by
RMSD and pair-wise distances, as demonstrated on several model systems.
Shape-GMM results on an extensive simulation of the the fast-folding HP35
Nle/Nle mutant protein support a 4-state folding/unfolding mechanism which is
consistent with previous experimental results and provides kinetic detail
comparable to previous state of the art clustering approaches, as measured by
the VAMP-2 score. Currently, training of shape-GMMs is recommended for systems
(or subsystems) that can be represented by $\lesssim$ 200 particles and
$\lesssim$ 100K configurations to estimate high-dimensional covariance matrices
and balance computational expense. Once a shape-GMM is trained, it can be used
to predict the cluster identities of millions of configurations.

$B^0\rightarrow\overline{D}^{*}(2007)^{0}K^{+}\pi^{-}$ and
$B_s^0\rightarrow\overline{D}^{*}(2007)^{0}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ decays are presented,
and their branching fractions relative to that of the
$B^0\rightarrow\overline{D}^{*}(2007)^{0}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay are reported.
These modes can potentially be used to investigate the spectroscopy of charm
and charm-strange resonances and to determine the angle $\gamma$ of the CKM
unitarity triangle. It is also important to understand them as a source of
potential background in determinations of $\gamma$ from $B^{+}\rightarrow
DK^{+}$ and $B^{0}\rightarrow DK^{+}\pi^{-}$ decays. The analysis is based on a
sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $5.4 ~\rm{fb}^{-1}$ of
proton--proton collision data at $13 ~\rm{TeV}$ centre-of-mass energy recorded
with the LHCb detector. The $\overline{D}^{*}(2007)^{0}$ mesons are fully
reconstructed in the $\overline{D}^{0}\pi^{0}$ and $\overline{D}^{0}\gamma$
channels, with the $\overline{D}^{0} \rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay. A novel
weighting method is used to subtract background while simultaneously applying
an event-by-event efficiency correction to account for resonant structures in
the decays.

that no single model is 'best' at predicting all common surface fluxes. Here,
we develop an urban neural network (UNN) trained on the mean predicted fluxes
from 22 ULSMs at one site. The UNN emulates the mean output of ULSMs
accurately. When compared to a reference ULSM (Town Energy Balance; TEB), the
UNN has greater accuracy relative to flux observations, less computational
cost, and requires fewer input parameters. When coupled to the Weather Research
Forecasting (WRF) model using TensorFlow bindings, WRF-UNN is stable and more
accurate than the reference WRF-TEB. Although the application is currently
constrained by the training data (1 site), we show a novel approach to improve
the modeling of surface fluxes by combining the strengths of several ULSMs into
one using ML.

information technologies. A bulk optical nonlinearity emitting a photon pair,
where the measurement of one of the photons heralds the presence of the other,
is commonly used with the caveat that the single-photon emission rate is
constrained due to a trade-off between multiphoton events and pair emission
rate. Using an efficient and low noise photon-number-resolving superconducting
nanowire detector we herald, in real time, a single photon at telecommunication
wavelength. We perform a second-order photon correlation $g^{2}(0)$ measurement
of the signal mode conditioned on the measured photon number of the idler mode
for various pump powers and demonstrate an improvement of a heralded
single-photon source. We develop an analytical model using a phase-space
formalism that encompasses all multiphoton effects and relevant imperfections,
such as loss and multiple Schmidt modes. We perform a maximum-likelihood fit to
test the agreement of the model to the data and extract the best-fit mean
photon number $\mu$ of the pair source for each pump power. A maximum reduction
of $0.118 \pm 0.012$ in the photon $g^{2}(0)$ correlation function at $\mu =
0.327 \pm 0.007$ is obtained, indicating a strong suppression of multiphoton
emissions. For a fixed $g^{2}(0) = 7e-3$, we increase the single pair
generation probability by 25%. Our experiment, built using fiber-coupled and
off-the-shelf components, delineates a path to engineering ideal sources of
single photons.

is engineering a test mass (TM) with sufficiently low acceleration noise. We
propose a GW detection concept using asteroids located in the inner Solar
System as TMs. Our main purpose is to evaluate the acceleration noise of
asteroids in the $\mu$Hz band. We show that a wide variety of environmental
perturbations are small enough to enable an appropriate class of $\sim 10$
km-diameter asteroids to be employed as TMs. This would allow a sensitive GW
detector in the band $\text{(few)} \times 10^{-7} \text{Hz} \lesssim
f_{\text{GW}} \lesssim \text{(few)} \times 10^{-5} \text{Hz}$, reaching strain
$h_c \sim 10^{-19}$ around $f_{\text{GW}} \sim 10 \mu$Hz, sufficient to detect
a wide variety of sources. To exploit these asteroid TMs, human-engineered base
stations could be deployed on multiple asteroids, each equipped with an
electromagnetic transmitter/receiver to permit measurement of variations in the
distance between them. We discuss a potential conceptual design with two base
stations, each with a space-qualified optical atomic clock measuring the
round-trip electromagnetic pulse travel time via laser ranging. Tradespace
exists to optimize multiple aspects of this mission: for example, using a
radio-ranging or interferometric link system instead of laser ranging. This
motivates future dedicated technical design study. This mission concept holds
exceptional promise for accessing this GW frequency band.

model. The power spectrum and spectral index receive slight scale dependence.
Finally, we consider a quartic potential motivated by the graceful exit to
reheating phase, which requires a nonminimal coupling to support inflation. The
two tensor modes of perturbed metric are found to evolve differently in this
model, and give rise to a highly scale-dependent power spectrum.

obtained the pair-production probability on the probability level by using
unitarity, i.e. the imaginary part of the effective action for Schwinger pair
production or the imaginary part of the polarization tensor for
photon-stimulated pair production. The corresponding instantons are closed
loops in the complex plane. Here we show how to use instantons on the amplitude
level, which means open instanton lines with start and end points representing

self-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory
utilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To
alleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ
self-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the
complexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window

shift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that
aggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions.
The key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and
efficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by
incorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show
improvements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy
with state-of-the-art models. Finally, our layer scales especially well with

One approach to measure this quantity uses the $\rho_\mathrm{s}$ distribution,
an observable depending on the invariant mass of the $t\bar{t}j$ system. To
fully exploit the experimental accuracy achievable in measuring top quark
production cross sections at the LHC, the theory uncertainties associated to
these measurements need to be well under control. To this end we present a
study of the effect of varying the theoretical input parameters in the
calculation of differential cross sections of the $t\bar{t}j$ process. Thereby
we studied the influence of the jet reconstruction procedure, as well as the
effect of various renormalization and factorization scale definitions and
different PDF sets. The variation of the $R$ parameter in the jet
reconstruction algorithm was found to have negligible influence on the scale
variation uncertainty. A strong reduction of scale uncertainties and a better
behaviour of the NLO/LO ratios using selected dynamical scales instead of a
static one in the high energy tails of differential distributions was observed.
This is particularly interesting in the context of the top quark mass
measurements through the $\rho_\mathrm{s}$ distribution, in which the
perturbative stability can be improved by applying the proposed dynamical scale
definition.

color-kinematics duality. This holds both for the gauge field and the BRST

can be formulated through a second-order differential operator (Poisson

itself. To obtain non-vanishing amplitudes, we deform pure CS theory by
including the maximum amount of adjoint matter that respects the on-shell

is widely studied, but existing methods focus on the major limbs of the body,
ignoring the hands and head. Hands have been separately studied, but the focus
has been on generating realistic static grasps of objects. To synthesize
virtual characters that interact with the world, we need to generate full-body
motions and realistic hand grasps simultaneously. Both sub-problems are
challenging on their own and, together, the state-space of poses is
significantly larger, the scales of hand and body motions differ, and the
whole-body posture and the hand grasp must agree, satisfy physical constraints,
and be plausible. Additionally, the head is involved because the avatar must
look at the object to interact with it. For the first time, we address the
problem of generating full-body, hand and head motions of an avatar grasping an
unknown object. As input, our method, called GOAL, takes a 3D object, its
position, and a starting 3D body pose and shape. GOAL outputs a sequence of
whole-body poses using two novel networks. First, GNet generates a goal
whole-body grasp with a realistic body, head, arm, and hand pose, as well as
hand-object contact. Second, MNet generates the motion between the starting and
goal pose. This is challenging, as it requires the avatar to walk towards the
object with foot-ground contact, orient the head towards it, reach out, and
grasp it with a realistic hand pose and hand-object contact. To achieve this,
the networks exploit a representation that combines SMPL-X body parameters and
3D vertex offsets. We train and evaluate GOAL, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, on the GRAB dataset. Results show that GOAL generalizes well to
unseen objects, outperforming baselines. GOAL takes a step towards synthesizing

photometric variations due to stellar pulsations, eclipses, the reflection
effect, ellipsoidal modulation, and Doppler beaming. Detailed studies of their
light curves help constrain stellar parameters through asteroseismological
analyses or binary light curve modeling and generally improve our capacity to
draw a statistically meaningful picture of this enigmatic stage of stellar
evolution. From an analysis of Gaia DR2 flux errors, we have identified around
1200 candidate hot subdwarfs with inflated flux errors for their magnitudes - a
strong indicator of photometric variability. As a pilot study, we obtained
2-min cadence TESS Cycle 2 observations of 187 candidate hot subdwarfs with
anomalous Gaia flux errors. More than 90% of our targets show significant
photometric variations in their TESS light curves. Many of the new systems
found are cataclysmic variables, but we report the discovery of several new
variable hot subdwarfs, including HW Vir binaries, reflection effect systems,
pulsating sdBVs stars, and ellipsoidally modulated systems. We determine
atmospheric parameters for select systems using follow-up spectroscopy from the
3-m Shane telescope. Finally, we present a Fourier diagnostic plot for
classifying binary light curves using the relative amplitudes and phases of
their fundamental and harmonic signals in their periodograms. This plot makes
it possible to identify certain types of variables efficiently, without
directly investigating their light curves, and may assist in the rapid
classification of systems observed in large photometric surveys.

consider the interface between two 3D TIs arranged with a relative twist angle.
We prove that if the two TIs are identical, then a necessary condition for a
magic angle where the Dirac cone velocity vanishes is to have an interlayer
spin-flipping hopping term. Without this term, the Dirac cone velocities can
still be significantly renormalized, decreasing to less than half of their
original values, but they will not vanish. Second, we consider graphene on the
surface of a TI arranged with a small twist angle. Again, a magic angle is only
achievable with a spin-flipping hopping term. Without this term, the Dirac cone
is renormalized, but not significantly. In both cases, our perturbative results
are verified by computing the band structure of the continuum model. The
enhanced density of states that results from decreasing the surface Dirac cone
velocity provides a tunable route to realizing interacting topological phases.

parity and time-reversal symmtries. Inside piezoelectric crystals, where parity
is broken spontaneously, this axion background can result in a stress. We call
this new phenomenon ""the piezoaxionic effect"". When the frequency of axion DM
matches the natural frequency of a bulk acoustic normal mode of the
piezoelectric crystal, the piezoaxionic effect is resonantly enhanced and can
be read out electrically via the piezoelectric effect. We explore all axion
couplings that can give rise to the piezoaxionic effect -- the most promising
one is the defining coupling of the QCD axion, through the anomaly of the
strong sector. We also point our another, subdominant phenomenon present in all
dielectrics, namely the ""electroaxionic effect"". An axion background can
produce an electric displacement field in a crystal which in turn will give
rise to a voltage across the crystal. The electroaxionic effect is again
largest for the axion coupling to gluons. We find that this model independent
coupling of the QCD axion may be probed through the combination of the
piezoaxionic and electroaxionic effects in piezoelectric crystals with aligned
nuclear spins, with near-future experimental setups applicable for axion masses
between $10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$, a challenging range

initiate a systematic study of these regions deep in the moduli space, and use
it to place a bound on the number of massless modes by relating it to the black
hole species problem. There exists a consistent sub-Planckian UV cutoff (the
species scale) which resolves the black hole species problem without bounding
the number of light modes. We reevaluate this in the context of supersymmetric
string vacua in the desert region and show that even though heuristically the
species scale is compatible with expectations, the BPS states of the actual
string vacua lead to a stronger dependence of the cutoff scale on the number of
massless modes. We propose that this discrepancy, which can be captured by the
""BPS desert conjecture"", resurrects the idea of a uniform bound on the number

the timescales of the secular von-Ziepel-Lidov-Kozai and the GT oscillations
are comparable, triple evolution becomes chaotic which leads to extreme
eccentricities. Consequently, the close pericentre approaches of the
inner-binary components lead to strong interactions, mergers and collisions. We
use a novel secular evolution code to quantify the key parameters and carry out
a population-synthesis study of low and intermediate-mass wide-orbit triples.
We find that in $\sim9\%$ of low-mass wide-triples the inner main-sequence
binaries collide or tidally-inspiral within $10\ \rm Gyr$, with direct
collisions are $6$ times more likely to occur. For the intermediate-mass
sample, $\sim7.6\%$ of the systems merge or inspiral with roughly equal
probabilities. We discuss the relative fractions of different stellar

electromagnetic signatures and the final products of the merger/inspiral. In
particular, the rate of WD-WD direct-collisions that lead to type-Ia Supernovae
is comparable to other dynamical channels and accounts for at most $0.1\%$ of

algorithm for groups (Brachter & Schweitzer, LICS 2020) can be fruitfully used
to improve parallel complexity upper bounds on isomorphism testing for several
families of groups. In particular, we show:
  - Groups with an Abelian normal Hall subgroup whose complement is
$O(1)$-generated are identified by constant-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman using
only a constant number of rounds. This places isomorphism testing for this
family of groups into $\textsf{L}$; the previous upper bound for isomorphism
testing was $\textsf{P}$ (Qiao, Sarma, & Tang, STACS 2011).
  - We use the individualize-and-refine paradigm to obtain a
$\textsf{quasiSAC}^{1}$ isomorphism test for groups without Abelian normal
subgroups, previously only known to be in $\textsf{P}$ (Babai, Codenotti, &
Qiao, ICALP 2012).
  - We extend a result of Brachter & Schweitzer (arXiv, 2021) on direct
products of groups to the parallel setting. Namely, we also show that
Weisfeiler-Leman can identify direct products in parallel, provided it can
identify each of the indecomposable direct factors in parallel. They previously
showed the analogous result for $\textsf{P}$.
  We finally consider the count-free Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, where we show
that count-free WL is unable to even distinguish Abelian groups in
polynomial-time. Nonetheless, we use count-free WL in tandem with bounded
non-determinism and limited counting to obtain a new upper bound of
$\beta_{1}\textsf{MAC}^{0}(\textsf{FOLL})$ for isomorphism testing of Abelian
groups. This improves upon the previous $\textsf{TC}^{0}(\textsf{FOLL})$ upper
bound due to Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, & Wagner (ACM Trans. Comput. Theory,
2013).

framework to further boost the performance and applicability of ML models. We
propose to combine ML decoders with a competing discriminator network that
tries to distinguish between codewords and noisy words, and, hence, guides the
decoding models to recover transmitted codewords. Our framework is
game-theoretic, motivated by generative adversarial networks (GANs), with the
decoder and discriminator competing in a zero-sum game. The decoder learns to
simultaneously decode and generate codewords while the discriminator learns to
tell the differences between decoded outputs and codewords. Thus, the decoder
is able to decode noisy received signals into codewords, increasing the
probability of successful decoding. We show a strong connection of our
framework with the optimal maximum likelihood decoder by proving that this
decoder defines a Nash equilibrium point of our game. Hence, training to
equilibrium has a good possibility of achieving the optimal maximum likelihood
performance. Moreover, our framework does not require training labels, which
are typically unavailable during communications, and, thus, seemingly can be
trained online and adapt to channel dynamics. To demonstrate the performance of
our framework, we combine it with the very recent neural decoders and show
improved performance compared to the original models and traditional decoding
algorithms on various codes.

describe the subtle effects that may rise from conservation laws and their

the mathematical structure of superstatistics itself, and thus no assumptions

quantum light is discussed. Their interaction with the quantum light induces
interactions between the molecules. The resulting hybrid light-matter states
exhibit complex structure even if only a single vibrational coordinate per
molecule is considered. Since all molecules are identical, it is appealing to
start from the uniform situation where all molecules possess the same value of
this vibrational coordinate. Then, polaritons and dark states follow like in
atoms, but are functions of this coordinate, and this vibrational degree of
freedom makes the physics different from that of atoms. However, in spite of
all molecules being identical, each molecule does have its own vibrational
coordinate. It is thus a vital issue to understand the meaning of the uniform
situation and how to depart from it, and enable one to realistically
investigate the ensemble. A rigorous and physically relevant meaning of the
polariton energy curves in the uniform situation has been found. It is proven
that any point on a polariton curve is a minimum or maximum for departing from
the uniform situation. It is shown how to explicitly compute the energetic
impact of departing from the uniform situation using solely properties of a
single free molecule. The dark states and their behavior upon departing from
the uniform situation are analyzed as well. Useful techniques not used in this
topical domain are introduced and general results on, e.g., minimum energy
path, symmetry breaking and restoration, are obtained. It is shown how to
transfer the findings to include several or even many nuclear degrees of
freedom per molecule and thus to address the problem of quantum light
interacting with many complex molecules. The interplay of several degrees of

was the case in the experimental systems studied so far. Here we report on an
emergent mechanism for pumping in a quantum gas coupled to an optical
resonator, where we observe a particle current without applying a periodic

self-consistent cavity field interfering with the static laser field driving
the atoms. Due to dissipation, the cavity field evolves between its two
quadratures, each corresponding to a different centrosymmetric crystal
configuration. This self-oscillation results in a time-periodic potential
analogous to that describing the transport of electrons in topological
tight-binding models, like the paradigmatic Rice-Mele pump. In the experiment,
we directly follow the evolution by measuring the phase winding of the cavity
field with respect to the driving field and observing the atomic motion
in-situ. The discovered mechanism combines the dynamics of topological and open
systems, and features characteristics of continuous dissipative time crystals.

process but also identify which patients would benefit from a closer follow-up

prediction models are based on dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics that omit
the spatial localisation and dose gradient and direction information provided
by the clinical mandible radiation dose distribution maps. Methods. We propose
the use of a binary classification 3D DenseNet121 to extract the relevant
dosimetric information directly from the 3D mandible radiation dose
distribution maps and predict the incidence of ORN. We compare the results to a
Random Forest ensemble with DVH-based parameters. Results. The 3D DenseNet121

characterize personalized management plans. Numerous methods have been proposed
to estimate individualized treatment rules that optimize expected patient
outcomes, many of which have desirable properties such as robustness to model
misspecification. However, while individual data are essential in this context,
there may be concerns about data confidentiality, particularly in multi-centre
studies where data are shared externally. To address this issue, we compared
two approaches to privacy preservation: (i) data pooling, which is a covariate
microaggregation technique and (ii) distributed regression. These approaches
were combined with the doubly robust yet user-friendly method of dynamic
weighted ordinary least squares to estimate individualized treatment rules. In
simulations, we extensively evaluated the performance of the methods in
estimating the parameters of the decision rule under different assumptions. The
results demonstrate that double robustness is not maintained in data pooling
setting and that this can result in bias, whereas the distributed regression
provides good performance. We illustrate the methods via an analysis of optimal
Warfarin dosing using data from the International Warfarin Consortium.

trans-Neptunian object (TNO) (90377) Sedna to study the surface and composition
from a close range. Studying Sedna from a close distance can provide unique
data about the Solar System evolution process including protoplanetary disc and
related mechanisms. The trajectories to Sedna are determined considering flight
time and the total characteristic velocity (${\Delta}V$) constraints. The time
of flight for the analysis was limited to 20 years. The direct flight, the use
of gravity assist manoeuvres near Venus, the Earth and the giant planets
Jupiter and Neptune, and the flight with the Oberth manoeuvre near the Sun are
considered. It is demonstrated that the use of flight scheme with
${\Delta}VEGA$ (${\Delta}V$ and Earth Gravity Assist manoeuvre) and
Jupiter-Neptune gravity assist leads to the lowest cost of ${\Delta}V$=6.13
km/s for launch in 2041. The maximum payload for schemes with ${\Delta}$VEGA
manoeuvre is 500 kg using Soyuz 2.1.b, 2,000 kg using Proton-M and Delta IV
Heavy and exceeds $12,000$ kg using SLS. For schemes with only Jupiter gravity
assist, payload mass is twice less than for ones with ${\Delta}$VEGA manoeuvre.
As a possible expansion of the mission to Sedna, it is proposed to send a small
spacecraft to another TNO during the primary flight to Sedna. Five TNOs
suitable for this scenario are found, three extreme TNOs 2012 VP113, (541132)

persistent oscillatory behavior around their mean growth. The orders of the
correlations show a power-law decaying hierarchy among its $k$-partitions.
Moreover, in the long-time limit the GMC's are shown extensive with the system
size, contrasting to the subextensive scaling in the non time-crystal

electrolytes. Our continuum approach naturally describes the electrolyte on a
macroscale. An integral formulation for the molecular repulsion,which can be
quantitatively determined by both experimental and theoretical methods, models
the electrolyteon the nanoscale. In this article, we perform a systematic
series expansion of this integral formulation, derive a description of chemical
potentials in terms of higher-order concentration gradients, and rationalize
the appearance of fourth-order derivative-operators in modified Poisson
equations, recently proposed in this context. In this way, we formulate a
rigorous multi-scale methodology from atomistic quantum chemistry calculations

liquids near electrified interfaces and perform analytic asymptotic analysis.
Three energy scales describing electrostatic forces between ions, molecular
repulsion, and thermal motion determine the shape and width of the long-ranging
charged double layer. We classify the charge screening mechanisms dependent on
the system parameters dielectricity, ionsize, interaction strength, and
temperature. We find that the charge density of electrochemical double layers
in ionic liquids either decays exponentially, for negligible molecular
repulsion, or oscillates continuously. Charge ordering across several
ion-diameters occurs if the repulsion between molecules is comparable with
thermal energy and Coulomb interaction. Eventually, phase separation of the
bulk electrolyte into ionic layers emerges once the molecular repulsion becomes
dominant. Our framework predicts the exact phase boundaries between these three
phases as function of temperature, dielectricity and ion-sizes.

extensively modelled, its emergence in the jet light curves of blazars calls
for a revised theoretical understanding of this feature. In this work, we
analyse the time variability properties of realistic multi-wavelength jet light
curves, simulated in the context of a simplified version of the internal shocks
model, particularly focusing on the rms-flux relation. These shocks accelerate
the jet electrons to relativistic energies, which then cool radiatively via
synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes. We find that the rms-flux relation
may be consistently recovered in the cases, in which the shocks have different
amplitudes based on the speed of the colliding blobs generating them as opposed
to all shocks having the same amplitude. We observe that the slope of the
rms-flux relation depends on the wavelength at which the variability is
observed and the energy distribution of the electron population. We find that
the accretion disc and the jet variability are anti-correlated, with the latter
lagging that of the disc. Our results provide crucial constraints on the

precision, for storing, processing, and transmitting information makes them
ideal candidates for multi-tasking purposes in quantum communication.
Appropriate quantum systems involving a judicious choice of interactions which
augment each other, are potentially useful for probing deep into quantum
regimes. Here, we make use of one such hybrid bipartite quantum model, with one
subsystem made of a pair of qubits and another comprising a pair of
oscillators, to study the entanglement dynamics, and the entanglement transfer
between discrete and continuous variables. Our basic model is the standard
double Jaynes-Cummings system, which is known to support both entanglement
transfer and entanglement sudden death, under suitable conditions. In this
work, we generalise this model to include further experimentally relevant
interactions, such as the beamsplitter-type exchange interaction between the
oscillators, and dipole-dipole and Ising-type interactions between the qubits.
The manner in which various interactions and initial oscillator states affect
the entanglement dynamics, is examined theoretically, for generic experimental
conditions. Using exact analytical solutions, we show that compared to the
beamsplitter or dipole-dipole interaction, the Ising interaction can have a
significant positive impact on entanglement sudden death and birth, and
postponement of the onset of these phenomena, apart from producing substantial
reduction in the time duration of the death.

of diameter at most $\Delta$ such that for every $x,y\in M$ the probability
that they belong to different clusters is at most $\sigma d_M(x,y)/\Delta$. We
obtain upper and lower bounds on the separation moduli of finite dimensional
normed spaces that relate them to well-studied volumetric invariants. Using
these connections, we find the growth rate of the separation moduli of various
normed spaces. We formulate a conjecture on isomorphic reverse isoperimetry
that can be used with our volumetric bounds on the separation modulus to obtain
many more asymptotic evaluations of the separation moduli of normed spaces. Our
estimates on the separation modulus imply improved bounds on the Lipschitz
extension moduli of various classical spaces. In particular, we deduce an
improved bound on $e(\ell_p^n)$ when $p>2$ that resolves a conjecture of
Brudnyi and Brudnyi, and prove that $e(\ell_\infty^n)\asymp{\sqrt{n}}$, which
is the first time that the order of $e(X)$ has been evaluated for any normed
space $X$.

mediating the interaction between the clay surface and water, and for some
materials between separate layers. It is well-established that the accuracy of
a computational model for clays depends on the level of theory at which the
electronic structure is treated. However, for hydrogen-bonded systems the
motion of light H nuclei on the electronic potential energy surface is often
affected by quantum delocalization. Using path integral molecular dynamics, we
show that nuclear quantum effects lead to a relatively small change in the
structure of clays, but one that is comparable to the variation incurred by
treating the clay at different levels of electronic structure theory.
Accounting for quantum effects weakens the hydrogen bonds in clays, with
H-bonds between different layers of the clay affected more than those within
the same layer; this is ascribed to the fact that the confinement of an H atom
inside a layer is independent of its participation in hydrogen-bonding. More
importantly, the weakening of hydrogen bonds by nuclear quantum effects causes
changes in the vibrational spectra of these systems, significantly shifting the
O--H stretching peaks and meaning that in order to fully understand these
spectra by computational modelling, both electronic and nuclear quantum effects
must be included. We show that after reparametrization of the popular CLAYFF
model for clays, the O--H stretching region of their vibrational spectra better
matches the experimental one, with no detriment to the model's agreement with
other experimental properties.

Multi-grained Input-adaptive Vision Transformer framework dubbed MIA-Former
that can input-adaptively adjust the structure of ViTs at three
coarse-to-fine-grained granularities (i.e., model depth and the number of model

is that its resulting ViTs are naturally equipped with improved robustness
against adversarial attacks over their static counterparts, because
MIA-Former's multi-grained dynamic control improves the model diversity similar
to the effect of ensemble and thus increases the difficulty of adversarial
attacks against all its sub-models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
validate that the proposed MIA-Former framework can effectively allocate
computation budgets adaptive to the difficulty of input images meanwhile
increase robustness, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy-efficiency

disruption event candidate during a prolonged ($>11$ yrs) outburst (Lin et al.
2017). It exhibited unique quasi-soft X-ray spectra of characteristic
temperature $kT\sim0.3$ keV for several years at the peak, but in a recent
Chandra observation (10 yrs into the outburst) a super-soft X-ray spectrum of
$kT\sim0.15$ keV was detected. Such dramatic spectral softening could signal
the transition from the super-Eddington to thermal state or the temporary
presence of a warm absorber. Here we report on our study of four new XMM-Newton
follow-up observations of the source. We found that they all showed super-soft
spectra, suggesting that the source had remained super-soft for $>5$ yrs. Then
its spectral change is best explained as due to the super-Eddington to thermal
spectral state transition. The fits to the thermal state spectra suggested a
smaller absorption toward the source than that obtained in Lin et al. (2017).
This led us to update the modeling of the event as due to the disruption of a
0.75 msun star by a massive black hole of a few$\times10^5$ msun. We also

the cooperation of their auditory and visual senses. Unlike earlier methods
which attempt to recognize entire event sequences, the EDRNet models EPCs and
inter-EPC relationships using stacked temporal convolutions. Based on the
postulation that EPC representations are theoretically consistent for an event

augmentation technique that blends source videos using different EPC template
sequences. Additionally, we design a new loss function called the
Land-Shore-Sea loss to compactify continuous foreground and background

flow and deformation properties, of hydrogels that define their
functionalities. However, the ubiquitous viscoplasticity and associated wall
slip behavior of hydrogels handicap the accurate characterization of their
rheological material functions. Here parallel-disk and cone-and-plate
viscometers were used to characterize the shear viscosity and wall slip
behavior of a crosslinked poly(acrylic acid), PAA, hydrogel (carbomer,
specifically Carbopol). It is demonstrated that parallel-disk viscometry, i.e.,
the steady torsional flow in between two parallel disks, but not the
cone-and-plate flow can be used to determine the yield stress and other
parameters of viscoplastic constitutive equations and wall slip behavior
unambiguously. Gap-dependent data from parallel-disk viscometry can then be
used to characterize the other parameters of the shear viscosity and wall slip
behavior of the hydrogel. The accuracies of the parameters of wall slip and
Herschel-Bulkley type viscoplastic constitutive equation in representing the
flow and deformation behavior of the hydrogel were tested via the comparisons
of the calculated and experimentally determined velocity distributions and
torques. The excellent agreements found reflect the accuracies of the
parameters of shear viscosity and wall slip and indicate that the methodologies
demonstrated here provide the means necessary to understand in detail the
steady flow and deformation behavior of hydrogels. Such a detailed
understanding of the viscoplastic nature and wall slip behavior of hydrogels
can then be used to design and develop novel hydrogels with a wider range of

Comprehending how these are energized, structured, and evolve is key to
understanding stellar coronae.
  Here we investigate how the energy to heat the loop is generated by
photospheric magneto-convection, transported into the upper atmosphere, and how
the internal structure of a coronal loop forms.
  In a 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model, we study an isolated coronal loop
rooted with both footpoints in a shallow layer within the convection zone using
the MURaM code. To resolve its internal structure, we limited the computational
domain to a rectangular box containing a single coronal loop as a straightened
magnetic flux tube. Field-aligned heat conduction, gray radiative transfer in
the photosphere and chromosphere, and optically thin radiative losses in the
corona were taken into account. The footpoints were allowed to interact
self-consistently with the granulation surrounding them.
  The loop is heated by a Poynting flux that is self-consistently generated
through small-scale motions within individual magnetic concentrations in the
photosphere. Turbulence develops in the upper layers of the atmosphere as a
response to the footpoint motions. We see little sign of heating by large-scale
braiding of magnetic flux tubes from different photospheric concentrations at a
given footpoint. The synthesized emission, as it would be observed by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly or the X-ray Telescope, reveals transient bright
strands that form in response to the heating events. Overall, our model roughly
reproduces the properties and evolution of the plasma as observed within
coronal loops.
  With this model we can build a coherent picture of how the energy flux to
heat the upper atmosphere is generated near the solar surface and how this
process drives and governs the heating and dynamics of a coronal loop.

key findings, the device is shown to reliably produce 1.1 +- 0.3 ns long x-ray

embedded curved grains in two-dimensional hexagonal materials, by examining and
comparing the results of grain rotation, shrinking, and grain boundary dynamics
over the full range of misorientation in binary systems of hexagonal boron
nitride and single-component graphene monolayers. Calculations of the relation
between grain radius and misorientation angle during time evolution reveal the
normal-tangential coupled motion of the grain boundary matching the Cahn-Taylor
formulation, as well as the transition to sliding and the regime of grain
motion without rotation. The key effect of two-component sublattice ordering is
identified, showing as a dual behavior of both positive and negative coupling
modes with grains rotating towards increasing and decreasing angles, which is
absent in two-dimensional single-component systems. The corresponding
mechanisms are beyond the purely geometric considerations and require the
energetic contribution from the difference between heteroelemental and
homoelemental atomic bondings and the subsequent availability of a diverse
variety of defect core structures and transformations. This indicates the
important role played by the lattice inversion symmetry breaking in binary or

conductivity. To test this assumption, electrical conductivity measurements
were conducted at pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the Tanzanian
lithosphere (1.5 and 3 GPa; from 400 to > 1500{\deg}C) on xenoliths from
Engorora, Northern Tanzania. I observe that, once garnet becomes stable in
fertile mantle rocks (> 60 km, 1.7 GPa), it nucleates at grain boundaries and
forms the backbone of a conductive network. At 3 GPa, the presence of
garnet-rich networks increases conductivity by a factor of 100 regardless of

(> 10^{-1} Sm^{-1}) conductivities in the Tanzanian lithospheric mantle are
best explained by low and high degrees of garnet connectivity, respectively.
Such high electrical conductivities in cratonic roots can be explained by the
presence of connected garnet clusters, suggesting mantle refertilization. I
suggest that the garnet network represents the result of plume triggered
metasomatism due to plume impingement, and may represent an unstable structure
that will eventually lead to loss of cratonic lithosphere.

rigorously shown that these systems exhibit a ""semilocalized"" phase in the
tails of the spectrum where the eigenvectors are exponentially localized on a
sub-extensive set of nodes with anomalously large degree. We propose two
approximate analytical strategies to analyze this regime based respectively on
the simple ""rules of thumb"" for localization and ergodicity and on an
approximate treatment of the self-consistent cavity equation for the resolvent.
Both approaches suggest the existence of two different regimes: a fully
Anderson localized phase at the spectral edges, in which the eigenvectors are
localized around a unique center, and an intermediate partially delocalized but
non-ergodic phase, where the eigenvectors spread over many resonant
localization centers. In this phase the exponential decay of the effective
tunneling amplitudes between the localization centers is counterbalanced by the
large number of nodes towards which tunneling can occur, and the system
exhibits mini-bands in the local spectrum over which the Wigner-Dyson
statistics establishes. We complement these results by a detailed numerical
study of the finite-size scaling behavior of several observables that supports
the theoretical predictions and allows us to determine the critical properties
of the two transitions. Critical ER graphs provide a pictorial representation
of the Hilbert space of a generic many-body Hamiltonian with short range
interactions. In particular we argue that their phase diagram can be mapped

non-equilibrium phase diagrams are, in general, qualitatively similar to those
obtained with quenched randomness at equilibrium in past works. Accordingly,
through this dynamics the essential critical behavior at finite temperatures
can be grasped for this model. The advantage is that simulations spend less
computational resources, since the system does not need to be replicated or
equilibrated with Parallel Tempering. A special attention was given for the
value of the amplitude of the correlation length at the critical point of the
superantiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition.

especially in industry and the physical sciences, where there is a strong need
to minimize the number of costly experiments necessary to train predictive

learning methods in many practical applications. One important challenge is
that many methods assume a fixed model, where model hyperparameters are chosen
a priori. In practice, it is rarely true that a good model will be known in
advance. Existing methods for active learning with model selection typically
depend on a medium-sized labeling budget. In this work, we focus on the case of
having a very small labeling budget, on the order of a few dozen data points,
and develop a simple and fast method for practical active learning with model
selection. Our method is based on an underlying pool-based active learner for
binary classification using support vector classification with a radial basis
function kernel. First we show empirically that our method is able to find
hyperparameters that lead to the best performance compared to an oracle model
on less separable, difficult to classify datasets, and reasonable performance
on datasets that are more separable and easier to classify. Then, we
demonstrate that it is possible to refine our model selection method using a
weighted approach to trade-off between achieving optimal performance on
datasets that are easy to classify, versus datasets that are difficult to
classify, which can be tuned based on prior domain knowledge about the dataset.

brittleness and ductility. While most mechanical studies of graphene focused on
the strength and brittle fracture behavior, its ductility, plastic deformation,
and the possible brittle-to-ductile transition, which are important for
high-temperature mechanical performance and applications, still remain much
less understood. Here the mechanical response and deformation dynamics of
graphene grain boundaries are investigated through a phase field crystal
modeling, showing the pivotal effects of temperature and local dislocation
structure. Our results indicate that even at relatively high temperature
(around 3350 K), the system is still governed by a brittle fracture and
cracking dynamics as found in previous low-temperature experimental and
atomistic studies. We also identify another type of failure dynamics with
low-angle grain boundary disintegration. When temperature increases a
transition to plastic deformation is predicted. The appearance of plastic flow
at ultrahigh temperature, particularly the phenomenon of jerky plasticity, is
attributed to the stick and climb-glide motion of dislocations around the grain
boundary. The corresponding mechanism is intrinsic to two-dimensional systems,
and governed by the competition between the driving force of accumulated local
stress and the defect pinning effect, without the traditional pathways of
dislocation generation needed in three-dimensional materials.

rather than photons to form an image. In its most common operation mode, the
measured quantity is the amount of energy that a proton has lost while
traversing the imaged object from which a relative stopping power map can be
obtained via tomographic reconstruction. To this end, a calorimeter which
measures the energy deposited by protons downstream of the scanned object has
been studied or implemented as energy detector in several proton CT prototypes.
An alternative method is to measure the proton's residual velocity and thus its
kinetic energy via the time of flight (TOF) between at least two sensor planes.
In this work, we study the precision, i.e. image noise, which can be expected
from TOF proton CT systems. We rely on physics models on the one hand and
statistical models of the relevant uncertainties on the other to derive closed
form expressions for the noise in projection images. The TOF measurement error
scales with the distance between the TOF sensor planes and is reported as
velocity error in ps/m. We use variance reconstruction to obtain noise maps of
a water cylinder phantom given the scanner characteristics and additionally
reconstruct noise maps for a calorimeter-based proton CT system as reference.
We find that TOF proton CT with 30 ps/m velocity error reaches similar image
noise as a calorimeter-based proton CT system with 1% energy error (1 sigma
error). A TOF proton CT system with a 50 ps/m velocity error produces slightly
less noise than a 2% calorimeter system. Noise in a reconstructed TOF proton CT
image is spatially inhomogeneous with a marked increase towards the object
periphery. This systematic study of image noise in TOF proton CT can serve as a
guide for future developments of this alternative solution for estimating the
residual energy of protons after the scanned object.

ferromagnets that has been experimentally synthesized and is commercially

material cannot persist unless magnetic anisotropy (MA) is present and
perpendicular to the plane, which permits a finite critical temperature.
Previous computational studies have predicted the magnetic ordering and Curie
temperature of 2D MnO$_2$ with DFT+U (Density Funtional Theory + Hubbard U
correction), with the results having a strong dependence on the Hubbard U
parameter. Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is a correlated electronic structure
method that has had demonstrated success for the electronic and magnetic
properties of a variety of 2D and bulk systems since it has a weaker dependence
on the starting Hubbard parameter and density functional. In this study, we
used DMC and DFT+U to calculate the magnetic properties of monolayer MnO$_2$.
We found that the ferromagnetic ordering is more favorable than
antiferromagnetic and determined a statistical bound on the magnetic exchange
parameter ($J$). In addition, we performed spin-orbit MA energy calculations
using DFT+U and using our DMC and DFT+U parameters along with the analytical
model of Torelli and Olsen, we estimated an upper bound of 28.8 K for the

accurate methodologies to predict magnetic properties of correlated 2D

namely that the bulk temperature vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, due to a
decoupling of the dynamics of the inner part of the system from the baths. At
variance with usual cases, this implies that the steady state depends on the

ejected while its major body remains intact. Given this scenario, we first
constrain Gaults bulk cohesive strength. We then characterize heliocentric
trajectories of ejected particles over thousands of years. The results show
that Gault may be sensitive to structural failure at the current spin period (~
2.5 hr). Gaults bulk density needs to be below 1.75 g/cm^3 in order for
particles on the equatorial surface to be shed due to centrifugal forces. In
this case, Gault requires cohesive strength of at least ~ 200 Pa to maintain
the structure at the center, whereas the surface strength needs to be less than
~ 100 Pa to induce mass shedding. This suggests that Gaults structure may
consist of a weak surface layer atop a strong core. The trajectories of dust
ejected from Gault depend on how efficiently they are accelerated by solar
radiation pressure. Escaped particle clouds with sizes on the order of 100

  Performance Impact of Dark-Silicon in High Performance Processors","The paper is accepted to HPCA 2022",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To reduce the leakage power of inactive (dark) silicon components, modern
processor systems shut-off these components' power supply using low-leakage
transistors, called power-gates. Unfortunately, power-gates increase the
system's power-delivery impedance and voltage guardband, limiting the system's
maximum attainable voltage (i.e., Vmax) and, thus, the CPU core's maximum
attainable frequency (i.e., Fmax). As a result, systems that are performance
constrained by the CPU frequency (i.e., Fmax-constrained), such as high-end
desktops, suffer significant performance loss due to power-gates.
  To mitigate this performance loss, we propose DarkGates, a hybrid system
architecture that increases the performance of Fmax-constrained systems while
fulfilling their power efficiency requirements. DarkGates is based on three key
techniques: i) bypassing on-chip power-gates using package-level resources
(called bypass mode), ii) extending power management firmware to support
operation either in bypass mode or normal mode, and iii) introducing deeper
idle power states.
  We implement DarkGates on an Intel Skylake microprocessor for client devices
and evaluate it using a wide variety of workloads. On a real 4-core Skylake
system with integrated graphics, DarkGates improves the average performance of
SPEC CPU2006 workloads across all thermal design power (TDP) levels (35W-91W)
between 4.2% and 5.3%. DarkGates maintains the performance of 3DMark workloads
for desktop systems with TDP greater than 45W while for a 35W-TDP (the lowest
TDP) desktop it experiences only a 2% degradation. In addition, DarkGates
fulfills the requirements of the ENERGY STAR and the Intel Ready Mode energy
efficiency benchmarks of desktop systems.

scale up to the Planck scale assisted by a novel mechanism. This mechanism is
based on softly breaking a global $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $ symmetry by technically
natural small vacuum misalignment, dynamically triggering the electroweak
symmetry breaking and Standard Model fermion mass generation. This mechanism
can be present in various models based on vacuum misalignment. For
concreteness, we demonstrate it in a minimal partially composite two-Higgs
scheme, where the Higgs is a mixture of a composite and an elementary state,
transforming odd under an $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $ symmetry. For this concrete model
example, all the dimensionful fundamental parameters are approximately $
\mathcal{O}(10^{18}) $ GeV. We study the vacuum stability of this model by
investigating the renormalization group running of the quartic coupling of the
Higgs. Furthermore, the parameter space can already be searched by
gravitational waves from a confinement-induced phase transition. Finally, the
mass and mixing of the neutrinos may be naturally generated via loops of a
second Higgs doublet, transforming even under the $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $ symmetry,
which may be challenged by lattice calculations and a more accurate measurement
of the top mass.

consisting of a disc, a bulge, and a dark halo is employed in the computations.
We provide a method to compute the dynamical friction acceleration in
ellipsoidal, oblate, and prolate velocity distribution functions with similar
density in velocity space. Orbital properties, such as mean time-variations of
perigalactic and apogalactic distances, energy, and z-component of angular
momentum, are obtained for globular clusters lying in the Galactic region $R
\lesssim$ 10 kpc, $|z| \lesssim$ 5 kpc, with $R,z$ cylindrical coordinates.
These include clusters in prograde and retrograde orbital motion. Several
clusters are strongly affected by dynamical friction, in particular Liller 1,
Terzan 4, Terzan 5, NGC 6440, and NGC 6553, which lie in the Galactic inner
region. We comment on the more relevant implications of our results on the
dynamics of Galactic globular clusters, such as their possible
misclassification between the categories 'halo', 'bulge', and 'thick disc', the
resulting biasing of globular-cluster samples, the possible incorrect
association of the globulars with their parent dwarf galaxies for accretion

  Fiber Composites Made From Repurposed Aerospace Prepreg Scrap and Waste",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this study, the effects of prepreg out time on the mechanical and fracture
properties of Discontinuous Fiber Composites (DFCs) are investigated. Carbon
fiber prepregs are aged at 0x, 1x, 2x, and 3x the out life in an environmental
chamber at constant temperature and humidity. Degree of cure is measured via
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) while tension, compression, and shear
tests are performed to investigate the effects that aging has on these
mechanical properties. For the first time, Mode I intra-laminar fracture and
its size effect are also investigated by means of fracture tests on
geometrically-scaled Single Edge Notch Tension (SENT) specimens.
  From the tension, compression, and shear experiments it is seen that the out
time has no effect on the elastic moduli. However, the strength increases with
increasing age of the specimens for all the loading conditions. The percent
increase compared to the non-aged material ranges from 15% to 33%. This is
likely caused by plasticization of the matrix with age, allowing for higher
energy absorption.
  More complex trends are reported for the SENT specimens for all the sizes. It
is found that the fracture energy and characteristic length initially decrease
with age, and then finally increase for the longest out time. This trend is
owed to two factors with countering effects on the fracture behavior: 1) the
increase of the average number of platelets with increasing aging due to
increase in resin viscosity, and 2) the plasticization of the matrix with
aging.
  The results from this study suggest that Discontinuous Fiber Composites
(DFCs) made from reused materials can have equal, if not better, performance
than non-aged DFCs. The experimental data presented in this work can be used as
a baseline to design DFC composite components made from repurposed prepreg

addressed this problem by improving the diversity of the training data. We
argue that diversity alone is not sufficient and that the characteristics of
the training data need to be adapted to those of the new dataset such as camera
viewpoint, position, human actions, and body size. To this end, we propose
AdaptPose, an end-to-end framework that generates synthetic 3D human motions
from a source dataset and uses them to fine-tune a 3D pose estimator. AdaptPose
follows an adversarial training scheme. From a source 3D pose the generator
generates a sequence of 3D poses and a camera orientation that is used to
project the generated poses to a novel view. Without any 3D labels or camera
information AdaptPose successfully learns to create synthetic 3D poses from the
target dataset while only being trained on 2D poses. In experiments on the

graph learning model. However, it can be notoriously challenging to inference
GCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world
graphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN
graphs. This is because real-world graphs can be extremely large and sparse.
Furthermore, the node degree of GCNs tends to follow the power-law distribution
and therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices, resulting in
prohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement and thus
substantially limiting the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency. To this end,
this paper proposes a GCN algorithm and accelerator Co-Design framework dubbed
GCoD which can largely alleviate the aforementioned GCN irregularity and boost
GCNs' inference efficiency. Specifically, on the algorithm level, GCoD
integrates a split and conquer GCN training strategy that polarizes the graphs
to be either denser or sparser in local neighborhoods without compromising the
model accuracy, resulting in graph adjacency matrices that (mostly) have merely
two levels of workload and enjoys largely enhanced regularity and thus ease of
acceleration. On the hardware level, we further develop a dedicated two-pronged
accelerator with a separated engine to process each of the aforementioned
denser and sparser workloads, further boosting the overall utilization and
acceleration efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate
that our GCoD consistently reduces the number of off-chip accesses, leading to
speedups of 15286x, 294x, 7.8x, and 2.5x as compared to CPUs, GPUs, and
prior-art GCN accelerators including HyGCN and AWB-GCN, respectively, while
maintaining or even improving the task accuracy. Codes are available at

given application workload is important in reducing the computational
foot-print during run-time. In edge or on-premise clouds, cold-start
rightsizing the cluster at the time of installation is crucial in avoiding the
recurrent capital expenditure. In both these cases, rightsizing has to balance
cost-performance trade-off for a given application with multiple tasks, where
each task can demand multiple resources, and the cloud offers nodes with
different capacity and cost. Multidimensional bin-packing can address this
cold-start rightsizing problem, but assumes that every task is always active.
In contrast, real-world tasks (e.g. load bursts, batch and dead-lined tasks
with time-limits) may be active only during specific time-periods or may have
dynamic load profiles. The cluster cost can be reduced by reusing resources via
time sharing and optimal packing. This motivates our generalized problem of
cold-start rightsizing for time-limited tasks: given a timeline, time-periods
and resource demands for tasks, the objective is to place the tasks on a
minimum cost cluster of nodes without violating node capacities at any time
instance. We design a baseline two-phase algorithm that performs penalty-based
mapping of task to node-type and then, solves each node-type independently. We
prove that the algorithm has an approximation ratio of O(D min(m, T)), where D,
m and T are the number of resources, node-types and timeslots, respectively. We
then present an improved linear programming based mapping strategy, enhanced
further with a cross-node-type filling mechanism. Our experiments on synthetic

mapping compared to the baseline, and the filling mechanism improves further to
produce solutions within 20% of (a lower-bound to) the optimal solution.

Hadron Collider (LHC) are under design or already in preparation. Two of them,
FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC, are expected to be active during Run 3 and have the
potential to detect neutrinos that come from high-energy collisions in one of
the LHC interaction points, extracted along the direction tangent to the beam
line. Tau neutrinos and antineutrinos come predominantly from $D_s^\pm$
production in $pp$ collisions, followed by the leptonic decay of these mesons.
Neutrino pseudorapidities in the range of $\eta>6.9$ and $\eta>8.9$ are
relevant to these future experiments. At such pseudorapidities at high
energies, theoretical predictions for the flux of tau neutrinos rely on parton
distribution functions (PDFs) in a combination of very small and large
parton$-x$ values. We evaluate PDF uncertainties in a next-to-leading order
(NLO) QCD calculation of the flux of $\nu_\tau$ + $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ produced by
$D_s^\pm$ decay in the far forward region at the LHC. The theoretical
uncertainty associated with the 40 PDF sets of the PROSA19 group amounts to
$\pm (20-30)$\% for the ($\nu_\tau$ + $\bar{\nu}_\tau$) number of
charged-current (CC) events. Scale uncertainties are much larger, resulting in
a range of CC event predictions from $\sim 70\%$ lower to $\sim 90\%$ higher
than the central prediction. A comparison of the predictions with those
obtained using as input the central PDFs from the 3-flavour NLO PDF sets of the
CT14, ABMP16 and NNPDF3.1 collaborations show that far-forward neutrino energy
distributions vary by as much as a factor of $\sim 2-4$ relative to the PROSA19
predictions at TeV neutrino energies. The Forward Physics Facility in the high
luminosity LHC era will provide data capable of constraining NLO QCD
evaluations with these PDF sets.

perform authentication and be robust to presentation attacks, all while
remaining compute and latency efficient. However, existing eye-based frameworks
a) perform authentication and Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) independently
and b) involve significant pre-processing steps to extract the iris region.
Here, we introduce a joint framework for EA and PAD using periocular images.
While a deep Multitask Learning (MTL) network can perform both the tasks, MTL
suffers from the forgetting effect since the training datasets for EA and PAD
are disjoint. To overcome this, we propose Eye Authentication with PAD
(EyePAD), a distillation-based method that trains a single network for EA and
PAD while reducing the effect of forgetting. To further improve the EA
performance, we introduce a novel approach called EyePAD++ that includes
training an MTL network on both EA and PAD data, while distilling the
`versatility' of the EyePAD network through an additional distillation step.
Our proposed methods outperform the SOTA in PAD and obtain near-SOTA
performance in eye-to-eye verification, without any pre-processing. We also
demonstrate the efficacy of EyePAD and EyePAD++ in user-to-user verification
with PAD across network backbones and image quality.

based on the complex behavior of a high-dimensional dynamical system and is

paper, we propose an extension of the herding algorithm, called entropic
herding, which generates a sequence of distributions instead of points.
Entropic herding is derived as the optimization of the target function obtained
from the maximum entropy principle. Using the proposed entropic herding
algorithm as a framework, we discuss a closer connection between herding and
the maximum entropy principle. Specifically, we interpret the original herding
algorithm as a tractable version of entropic herding, the ideal output
distribution of which is mathematically represented. We further discuss how the
complex behavior of the herding algorithm contributes to optimization. We argue
that the proposed entropic herding algorithm extends the application of herding
to probabilistic modeling. In contrast to original herding, entropic herding
can generate a smooth distribution such that both efficient probability density
calculation and sample generation become possible. To demonstrate the viability
of these arguments in this study, numerical experiments were conducted,
including a comparison with other conventional methods, on both synthetic and

frequency comb generation, optical filtering, and biosensing. However, many of
these applications are difficult to implement in optical metasurfaces because
traditional approaches for designing multi-resonant nanostructures require
significant computational and fabrication efforts. To address this challenge,
we introduce the concept of Fourier lattice resonances (FLRs) in which multiple
desired resonances can be chosen a priori and used to dictate the metasurface
design. Because each resonance is supported by a distinct surface lattice mode,
each can have a high quality factor. Here, we experimentally demonstrate
several metasurfaces with arbitrarily placed resonances (e.g., at 1310 and 1550
nm) and Q-factors as high as 800 in a plasmonic platform. This flexible
procedure requires only the computation of a single Fourier transform for its
design, and is based on standard lithographic fabrication methods, allowing one
to design and fabricate a metasurface to fit any specific, optical-cavity-based
application. This work represents an important milestone towards the complete
control over the transmission spectrum of a metasurface.

degradation to over-smoothing. In this paper, we conduct theoretical and
experimental analysis to explore the fundamental causes of performance
degradation in deep GCNs: over-smoothing and gradient vanishing have a mutually
reinforcing effect that causes the performance to deteriorate more quickly in
deep GCNs. On the other hand, existing anti-over-smoothing methods all perform
full convolutions up to the model depth. They could not well resist the
exponential convergence of over-smoothing due to model depth increasing. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play module, SkipNode, to
overcome the performance degradation of deep GCNs. It samples graph nodes in
each convolutional layer to skip the convolution operation. In this way, both
over-smoothing and gradient vanishing can be effectively suppressed since (1)
not all nodes perform full convolutions up to the model depth and, (2) the
gradient can be directly passed back through ``skipped'' nodes. We provide both
theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation to demonstrate the efficacy of
SkipNode and its superiority over SOTA baselines.

to compensate for the channel fluctuations and lock the laser fluctuations, the
techniques of phase tracking and phase locking are indispensable in experiment,
which drastically increase experimental complexity and hinder free-space
realization. Inspired by the duality in entanglement, we herein present an
asynchronous measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol
that can surpass the secret key capacity even without phase tracking and phase

Bell-state measurement is realized by postmatching two interference detection
events. For a 1 GHz system, the new protocol reaches a transmission distance of
450 km without phase tracking. After further removing phase locking, our
protocol is still capable of breaking the capacity at 270 km. Intriguingly,
when using the same experimental techniques, our protocol has a higher key rate
than the phase-matching-type twin-field protocol. In the presence of imperfect
intensity modulation, it also has a significant advantage in terms of the
transmission distance over the sending-or-not-sending type twin-field protocol.

considered here is modeled by a perturbation term added to the background
complex-valued $L^{\infty}$-potential. Under a jump condition on the term
across the boundary of the obstacle and some kind of regularity for the

present the Universe is very close to being essentially flat and most
signatures of curvature appear to have been diluted by inflation, if the number
of e-foldings during inflation is close to the minimum necessary to explain the
horizon problem, the curvature of the universe may have left imprints in the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) that may be observable, especially at large
angles. Motivated by general results on quantum cosmology and using effective
field theory techniques, we develop a general approach for analytically
computing the power spectrum of density perturbations for a closed universe.
Following a Hamiltonian formalism we determine the corresponding Bunch-Davis
vacuum, find analytic expressions for two-point functions and higher
correlators, expanding in terms of $S^3$ harmonics. In particular we
concentrate on potential implications for observable non-Gaussianities. We
consider cubic interactions as well as higher derivative ones to explore the
consequence of a speed of sound $c_s\neq 1$. For large multipoles curvature
effects are negligible and reproduce the known results for the flat case.
However, they depart from the flat space result for relatively small
multipoles. In this limit non-Gaussianities may lead to potentially observable
values of $f_{\rm NL}$. In particular we find terms in $f_{\rm NL}$ that are
absent in the flat space case, which are important at large scales and may be
observable even if a long period of inflation dilutes the curvature. We compare
our results with previous discussions in the literature.

2018fyk while the source was in the hard spectral state. The lags are detected
at $6.51\times10^{-5}~\rm Hz$. The amplitude of the lags with respect to
0.5$-$1 keV monotonically decreases with the photon energy, from $\sim 1200~\rm
s$ at 0.3$-$0.5 keV to $\sim -4200~\rm s$ at 3$-$5 keV (in our convention a
positive lag means lagging behind the reference band). We find that the
amplitude is proportional to the logarithm of the energy separation between the
examined band and the reference band. The energy-dependent covariance spectrum
indicates that the correlated variability is more likely to be associated with
the non-thermal radiation. The soft lags are difficult to reconcile with the
reverberation scenario that are used to explain the soft lags in active
galactic nuclei. On the other hand, the observed soft lags are consistent with
the picture that the soft X-rays are down-scattered hard X-rays by the outflow

Topological magnon modes appear at the interface between a topological domain
and a trivial domain with magnon currents, which counterpropagate depending on
pseudospins originated from orbital angular momenta of magnon modes. This
mimics the spin-momentum locking phenomenon in the quantum spin Hall effect.

maximization of IA a foundational challenge in CCS design. While the IA
associated with a particular CCS design can be estimated via a computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, using CFD to derive the IAs associated with
numerous CCS designs is prohibitively costly. Fortunately, previous works such
as Deep Fluids (DF) (Kim et al., 2019) show that large simulation speedups are
achievable by replacing CFD simulators with neural network (NN) surrogates that
faithfully mimic the CFD simulation process. This raises the possibility of a
fast, accurate replacement for a CFD simulator and therefore efficient
approximation of the IAs required by CCS design optimization. Thus, here, we
build on the DF approach to develop surrogates that can successfully be applied
to our complex carbon-capture CFD simulations. Our optimized DF-style
surrogates produce large speedups (4000x) while obtaining IA relative errors as
low as 4% on unseen CCS configurations that lie within the range of training
configurations. This hints at the promise of NN surrogates for our CCS design
optimization problem. Nonetheless, DF has inherent limitations with respect to
CCS design (e.g., limited transferability of trained models to new CCS

various metal-plastic composite parts having complicated hollow micro-nano

that has been widely used for model training in various machine learning
applications, which aims to solve a nonconvex minimax optimization problem.
However, the existing studies show that it suffers from a high computation
complexity in nonconvex minimax optimization. In this paper, we develop a
single-loop and fast AltGDA-type algorithm that leverages proximal gradient
updates and momentum acceleration to solve regularized nonconvex minimax
optimization problems. By leveraging the momentum acceleration technique, we
prove that the algorithm converges to a critical point in nonconvex minimax
optimization and achieves a computation complexity in the order of
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{\frac{11}{6}}\epsilon^{-2})$, where $\epsilon$ is the
desired level of accuracy and $\kappa$ is the problem's condition number. {Such
a computation complexity improves the state-of-the-art complexities of
single-loop GDA and AltGDA algorithms (see the summary of comparison in

Conformist norm internalization, the tendency to abide by the behavior of the
majority of the group, even when it is individually harmful, could be the
answer. In this paper, we analyze a world where (1) there is group selection
and punishment by indirect reciprocity but (2) many actions (about half) go
unobserved, and therefore unpunished. Can norm internalization fill this
'observation gap' and lead to high levels of cooperation, even when agents may
in principle cooperate only when likely to be caught and punished?
Specifically, we seek to understand whether adding norm internalization to the
strategy space in a public goods game can lead to higher levels of cooperation
when both norm internalization and cooperation start out rare. We found the
answer to be positive, but, interestingly, not because norm internalizers end
up making up a substantial fraction of the population, nor because they
cooperate much more than other agent types. Instead, norm internalizers, by
polarizing, catalyzing, and stabilizing cooperation, can increase levels of
cooperation of other agent types, while only making up a minority of the
population themselves.

Field Theory (SMEFT): how and to what extend can one reconstruct the UV theory,
given the measured values of the operator coefficients in the IR? The main
obstacle of this problem is the degeneracies in the space of coefficients: a
given SMEFT truncated at a finite dimension can be mapped to infinitely many UV
theories. We discuss these degeneracies at the dimension-8 level, and show that
positivity bounds play a crucial role in the inverse problem. In particular,
the degeneracies either vanish or become significantly limited for SMEFTs that
live on or close to the positivity bounds. The UV particles of these SMEFTs,
and their properties such as spin, charge, other quantum numbers, and
interactions with the SM particles, can often be uniquely determined, assuming
dimension-8 coefficients are measured. The allowed region for SMEFTs, which
forms a convex cone, can be systematically constructed by enumerating its
generators. We show that a geometric notion, extremality, conveniently connects
the positivity problem with the inverse problem. We discuss the implications of
a SMEFT living on an extremal ray, on a $k$-face, and on the vertex of the
positive cone. We also show that the information of the dimension-8
coefficients can be used to set exclusion limits on all individual UV states
that interact with the SM, independent of specific model assumptions. Our
results indicate that the dimension-8 operators encode much more information
about the UV than one would naively expect, which can be used to reverse
engineer the UV physics from the SMEFT.

independence between two random vectors $X$ and $Y$ given $Z$. The local
permutation test determines the significance of a test statistic by locally
shuffling samples which share similar values of the conditioning variables $Z$,
and it forms a natural extension of the usual permutation approach for
unconditional independence testing. Despite its simplicity and empirical
support, the theoretical underpinnings of the local permutation test remain
unclear. Motivated by this gap, this paper aims to establish theoretical
foundations of local permutation tests with a particular focus on binning-based
statistics. We start by revisiting the hardness of conditional independence
testing and provide an upper bound for the power of any valid conditional
independence test, which holds when the probability of observing collisions in
$Z$ is small. This negative result naturally motivates us to impose additional
restrictions on the possible distributions under the null and alternate. To
this end, we focus our attention on certain classes of smooth distributions and
identify provably tight conditions under which the local permutation method is
universally valid, i.e. it is valid when applied to any (binning-based) test
statistic. To complement this result on type I error control, we also show that
in some cases, a binning-based statistic calibrated via the local permutation
method can achieve minimax optimal power. We also introduce a double-binning
permutation strategy, which yields a valid test over less smooth null
distributions than the typical single-binning method without compromising much
power. Finally, we present simulation results to support our theoretical
findings.

effective tool to learn unknown dynamics from input/output data. However,
conventional GP-based control methods often ignore the computational cost
associated with accumulating data during the operation of the system and how to
handle forgetting in continuous adaption. In this paper, we present a novel
Dual Gaussian Process (DGP) based model predictive control strategy that
improves the performance of a quadcopter during trajectory tracking. The
bio-inspired DGP structure is a combination of a long-term GP and a short-term
GP, where the long-term GP is used to keep the learned knowledge in memory and
the short-term GP is employed to rapidly compensate unknown dynamics during
online operation. Furthermore, a novel recursive online update strategy for the

word substitution attacks using only synonyms can easily fool a BERT-based
sentiment analysis model. In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarial
training, the prevalent defense technique, does not directly fit a conventional
fine-tuning scenario, because it suffers severely from catastrophic forgetting:
failing to retain the generic and robust linguistic features that have already
been captured by the pre-trained model. In this light, we propose Robust
Informative Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a novel adversarial fine-tuning method from an
information-theoretical perspective. In particular, RIFT encourages an
objective model to retain the features learned from the pre-trained model
throughout the entire fine-tuning process, whereas a conventional one only uses
the pre-trained weights for initialization. Experimental results show that RIFT
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts on two popular NLP tasks:
sentiment analysis and natural language inference, under different attacks

construct a regularized adjacency matrix and obtain an approximate partition
based on singular vectors; (3) Correction and merging: incorporate the

naturally continues radially and inside the black hole event horizon and yields
a Kasner-structure near singularity, as has been observed in recent works. We
show that for a generic value of the deformation, the putative IR fixed point
remains inside the black hole. By fine-tuning this deformation, the ""fixed
point"" can be brought arbitrarily close to the event horizon, while always
remaining inside. Physically, this distinguishes between the vanishing
temperature limit of the RG-flows with the one at exactly zero temperature. We
further discuss its general implications in the context of Holography. We also

evolution modes having features like isotropic pressure, density homogeneity,
homologous and geodesic behavior. It is concluded that dynamics of these modes
of evolution depends upon the behavior of dark matter. The presences of dark
matter directly affects the features of cluster like anisotropic pressure,
dissipation, expansion, shear as well as density homogeneity. The evolution
having homogeneous density and isotropic pressure depends upon conformally flat

dissipation factor induces density inhomogeneity in the expanding clusters
having shear effects. The non dissipative homologous evolution also be
discussed in the presence and absence of shear effects. It is found that high

Expanding clusters are also explored in the presences of dissipation of dark

evolution is studied. It is theoretically showed that geodesic and homologous
conditions depends upon each other. Finally we investigate behavior of

to deal with neurodegenerative disorders. While a number of medical devices
have been developed for the detection, prevention, and treatments of such
disorders, some fundamentals of the progression of associated diseases are in
urgent need of further clarification. In this paper, we focus on Alzheimer's
disease, where it is believed that the concentration changes in amyloid-beta
and tau proteins play a central role in its onset and development. A multiscale
model is proposed to analyze the propagation of these concentrations in the
brain connectome. In particular, we consider a modified heterodimer model for
the protein-protein interactions. Higher toxic concentrations of amyloid-beta
and tau proteins destroy the brain cell. We have studied these propagations for
the primary and secondary and their mixed tauopathy. We model the damage of a
brain cell by the nonlocal contributions of these toxic loads present in the
brain cells. With the help of rigorous analysis, we check the stability
behaviour of the stationary points corresponding to the homogeneous system.
After integrating the brain connectome data into the developed model, we see
that the spreading patterns of the toxic concentrations for the whole brain are
the same, but their concentrations are different in different regions. Also,
the time to propagate the damage in each region of the brain connectome is
different.

to simulate non-uniform interfacial degradation of reinforcing steel in
concrete in an accelerated corrosion setup. In this study, a multi physics
finite element (FE) model is presented that takes into consideration the
spatial and temporal non uniformity of corrosion induced degradation in rebar,
and eliminates the assumption of uniform mass loss and its linear variation
with time as per available literature that uses classical approach of Faraday's
law. The model is validated experimentally with accelerated corrosion setup
designed to induce partial corrosion. Further, the possibility of extending
this model to monitor natural corrosion is discussed with required
modifications. Unlike previous studies, pore saturation (PS) is continuously
monitored and its existing experimental correlations with electrolyte
conductivity and oxygen diffusivity in the vicinity of partial corrosion are
adopted so that the model can be extended to simulate natural corrosion. These
evaluations can be made completely nondestructive and in real time to capture
the influence of local environment. The proposed methodology also captures the
effect of differential aeration pertaining to local exposure. Therefore, the
challenges in incorporating influence of local environment by the use of
alternative parameters such as relative humidity from real climate change
predictions are eliminated. It is shown that the multi-physics model is
effective and convenient to simulate the non-uniform time dependent mass loss
with acceptable accuracy and that its capability can be extended to monitor
natural non uniform corrosion on a space time frame.

users to specify GNN training with only a handful of lines of code. To evaluate
HP-GNN, we experiment with two well-known sampling-based GNN training

  Assessment","Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image regression tasks for medical applications, such as bone mineral density
(BMD) estimation and left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prediction, play
an important role in computer-aided disease assessment. Most deep regression
methods train the neural network with a single regression loss function like
MSE or L1 loss. In this paper, we propose the first contrastive learning
framework for deep image regression, namely AdaCon, which consists of a feature
learning branch via a novel adaptive-margin contrastive loss and a regression
prediction branch. Our method incorporates label distance relationships as part
of the learned feature representations, which allows for better performance in
downstream regression tasks. Moreover, it can be used as a plug-and-play module
to improve performance of existing regression methods. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of AdaCon on two medical image regression tasks, ie, bone mineral
density estimation from X-ray images and left-ventricular ejection fraction
prediction from echocardiogram videos. AdaCon leads to relative improvements of
3.3% and 5.9% in MAE over state-of-the-art BMD estimation and LVEF prediction
methods, respectively.

mobility matrix for two and more particles in a low Reynolds number fluid with

perturbation superimposed on a constant viscosity background, we exploit the
Lorentz reciprocal theorem and a reflection method to obtain the leading order
correction to the mobility matrix. We apply our approach firstly to an
interface-like linear viscosity gradient with an extension much larger than the
length scale of the particle separation. We find that the viscosity gradient
gives rise to additional long-range flow fields, for both particle translation
and rotation, which decay by one order slower than their constant-viscosity
counterparts. Also, we reveal that the relative positioning of two interacting
particles in finite-size gradients, a natural precondition to avoid
pathological negative viscosity, affects the mobilities of and interaction
between both particles. Secondly, we apply our result to two interacting
particles with temperatures different from that of the surrounding fluid, which
alters both the fluid temperature and viscosity field. We find that both, the
self-mobilities of the particles as well as their interactions, increase for
hot particles and decrease for cold particles.

source remained in the Low Hard State (LHS) displaying transitions to softer
states only towards the end of the outburst for short periods of time. Quasi
periodic Oscillations (QPOs) were observed in the Power Density Spectrum (PDS)
only during the decay. A soft thermal component was required to model the
spectrum in LHS, which does not conform to the generally accepted disc
truncation theory. In this work, we attempt to obtain a clearer picture of the
accretion disc geometry by studying the QPO variability using frequency
resolved spectroscopy (FRS). We obtain the QPO rms spectrum of the source
during the bright-hard state and model it with physical components. We find
that the QPO rms spectrum can be described only by a Comptonisation component
with no contribution from the thermal disc. This indicates that the variability
observed in the PDS originates in the Comptonisation component and the
evolution of the QPOs is likely to be a result of localization of the
variabilities to different radii of the hot inner flow rather than disc
truncation. The minimal variation in disc parameters also points to the
existence of a stable disc throughout the outburst.

mechanism governing the spatial segregation of bacterial chromosomes, although
it remains incompletely understood how proteins aid the process of entropic
segregation. Here we establish that `internal' loops within a modified-ring
polymer architecture enhances entropic repulsion between two overlapping
polymers confined in a cylinder. Moreover it also induces entropy-driven
spatial organization of polymer segments as seen in-vivo. To that end, we
design polymers of different architectures in our simulations, by introducing a
minimal number of cross-links between particular monomers along the chain
contour. This helps us to identify the underlying mechanisms which lead to
faster segregation of spatially overlapping polymers as well as localization of
specific polymer segments. The observed segregation dynamics of overlapping
polymers is aided in our simulations by the frequent release of topological
constraints, implemented by allowing chains to cross each at regular intervals.
Additionally, we compare the segregation dynamics timescales with that of
self-avoiding polymers and thereby highlight the significance of Topoisomerase
in biological systems where DNA-strands are allowed to occasionally pass
through each other. We use the blob model to provide a theoretical
understanding of why or how certain architectures lead to enhanced entropic
repulsive forces between loops, which in turn leads to the positional
organization of segments relative to each other in confined environments.
Lastly, we establish a correspondence between the C.crescentus bacterial
species and our results for one particular polymer architecture.

segregation refers to the low interface energy, resulting in the appearing of
the sidebranches behind the tip of the primary dendrites. At the steady-state
stage, the overall propagation velocities of the interfaces are the same, while
the tip velocities are different in the simulations with different PCOs. The
different tip velocities give rise to the different morphological evolution of
the interfaces. The viewpoints of the whole dissipative system and the local

for each utterance. Motivated by recent studies which have proven that feeding
training examples in a meaningful order rather than considering them randomly
can boost the performance of models, we propose an ERC-oriented hybrid
curriculum learning framework. Our framework consists of two curricula: (1)
conversation-level curriculum (CC); and (2) utterance-level curriculum (UC). In
CC, we construct a difficulty measurer based on ""emotion shift"" frequency
within a conversation, then the conversations are scheduled in an ""easy to
hard"" schema according to the difficulty score returned by the difficulty
measurer. For UC, it is implemented from an emotion-similarity perspective,
which progressively strengthens the model's ability in identifying the
confusing emotions. With the proposed model-agnostic hybrid curriculum learning
strategy, we observe significant performance boosts over a wide range of
existing ERC models and we are able to achieve new state-of-the-art results on
four public ERC datasets.

describe underlying structures in high-dimensional data. Methods such as factor
analysis and principal component analysis have the downside of not offering
much interpretability of its inferred latent variables. Sparse factor analysis
addresses this issue by imposing sparsity on its factor loadings, allowing each
latent variable to be related to only a subset of features, thus increasing
interpretability. Sparse factor analysis has been used in a wide range of areas
including genomics, signal processing, and economics. We compare two Bayesian
inference techniques for sparse factor analysis, namely Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC), and variational inference (VI). VI is computationally faster than
MCMC, at the cost of a loss in accuracy. We derive MCMC and VI algorithms and
perform a comparison using both simulated and biological data, demonstrating
that the higher computational efficiency of VI is desirable over the small gain
in accuracy when using MCMC. Our implementation of MCMC and VI algorithms for
sparse factor analysis is available at https://github.com/ysfoo/sparsefactor.

each vertex not in $S$ has a neighbor in $S$. The domination number of $G$,
denoted $\gamma(G)$, is the minimum size of a dominating set of $G$. The
independent domination number of $G$, denoted $i(G)$, is the minimum size of a
dominating set of $G$ that is also independent.
  Recently, Abrishami and Henning proved that if $G$ is a cubic graph with
girth at least $6$, then $i(G) \le \frac{4}{11}|V(G)|$. We show a result that
not only improves upon the upper bound of the aforementioned result, but also
applies to a larger class of graphs, and is also tight. Namely, we prove that
if $G$ is a cubic graph without $4$-cycles, then $i(G) \le \frac{5}{14}|V(G)|$,
which is tight. Our result also implies that every cubic graph $G$ without
$4$-cycles satisfies $\frac{i(G)}{\gamma(G)} \le \frac{5}{4}$, which partially
answers a question by O and West in the affirmative.

comparative analysis of results show that the behavior of addresses in Ethereum

for energy-efficient massive multiple-input multiple-output networks to support

synchronization among users when executing each FL communication round, while
the asynchronous design allows more flexibility for users to save energy by
using lower computing frequencies. The session-based design splits the downlink
and uplink phases in each FL communication round into separate sessions. In
this design, we assign users such that one of the participating users in each
session finishes its transmission and does not join the next session. As such,
more power and degrees of freedom will be allocated to unfinished users,
leading to higher rates, lower transmission times, and hence, a higher energy
efficiency. In all three designs, we use zero-forcing processing for both
uplink and downlink, and develop algorithms that optimize user assignment, time
allocation, power, and computing frequencies to minimize the energy consumption
at the base station and users, while guaranteeing a predefined maximum
execution time of one FL communication round.

reveal that the population of the polariton states can be tuned by the

polaritonic critical coupling is achieved in the designed system while $\rm

measurements of the charge collection and time resolution. The TPA spot is
determined to have a radius of 0.975(11) $\mu\text{m}$ and length of 23.8
$\mu\text{m}$ in silicon. The trigger time resolution of the system is shown to
be maximally 30.4 ps. For both sensors, uniform charge collection is observed
over the pixels, and the pixel side metallisation is imaged directly using the

  Domain",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The local optimality of motion vectors (MVs) is an intrinsic property in
video coding, and any modifications to the MVs will inevitably destroy this
optimality, making it a sensitive indicator of steganography in the MV domain.
Thus the local optimality is commonly used to design steganalytic features, and
the estimation for local optimality has become a top priority in video
steganalysis. However, the local optimality in existing works is often
estimated inaccurately or using an unreasonable assumption, limiting its
capability in steganalysis. In this paper, we propose to estimate the local
optimality in a more reasonable and comprehensive fashion, and generalize the
concept of local optimality in two aspects. First, the local optimality
measured in a rate-distortion sense is jointly determined by MV and predicted
motion vector (PMV), and the variability of PMV will affect the estimation for
local optimality. Hence we generalize the local optimality from a static
estimation to a dynamic one. Second, the PMV is a special case of MV, and can
also reflect the embedding traces in MVs. So we generalize the local optimality
from the MV domain to the PMV domain. Based on the two generalizations of local
optimality, we construct new types of steganalytic features and also propose
feature symmetrization rules to reduce feature dimension. Extensive experiments
performed on three databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
features, which achieve state-of-the-art in both accuracy and robustness in
various conditions, including cover source mismatch, video prediction methods,

between the Dirac and the semi-Dirac limits of a tight-binding model on a
honeycomb lattice. The above scenario is mimicked in a simple model, where
there exists a differential hopping along one of the three neighbours (say,
$t_1$) compared to the other two (say, $t$). For $t_1 = t$, the properties of
the quantum spin Hall phase is described by the familiar Kane Mele model, while
$t<t_1<2t$ denotes a situation in which the spin resolved bands are
continuously deformed. $t_1 = 2t$ represents a special case which is called as
the semi-Dirac limit. Here, the spectral gaps between the conduction and the
valence bands vanish. A closer inspection of the properties of such a deformed
system yields insights on a topological phase transition occurring at the
semi-Dirac limit, which continues to behave as a band insulator for $t_1>2t$.
We demonstrate the evolution of the topological phase in presence of the Rashba

edge modes in a nanoribbon and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. The latter aids in
arriving at the phase diagram which conclusively shows vanishing of the
topological phase in the semi-Dirac limit. Further we demonstrate in gradual
narrowing down of the plateau in the spin Hall conductivity, which along with a
phase diagram provide robust support on the vanishing of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$

as a conditional label sequence generation task and propose a Label
Dependence-aware Sequence Generation Model (LDSGM) for it. Specifically, we
first design a label attentive encoder to learn the global representation of an
input instance and its level-specific contexts, where the label dependence is
integrated to obtain better label embeddings. Then, we employ a label sequence
decoder to output the predicted labels in a top-down manner, where the
predicted higher-level labels are directly used to guide the label prediction
at the current level. We further develop a mutual learning enhanced training
method to exploit the label dependence in a bottomup direction, which is
captured by an auxiliary decoder introduced during training. Experimental
results on the PDTB dataset show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on multi-level IDRR. We will release our code at

two sub-losses which act in a complementary way when learning the
representation network: a positive term and an entropy term. Although the
overall loss is thus defined as a combination of two terms, the balance of
these two terms is often hidden behind implementation details and is largely
ignored and sub-optimal in practice. In this work, we approach the balance of
contrastive losses as a hyper-parameter optimization problem, and propose a
coordinate descent-based search method that efficiently find the
hyper-parameters that optimize evaluation performance. In the process, we
extend existing balance analyses to the contrastive margin loss, include batch
size in the balance, and explain how to aggregate loss elements from the batch
to maintain near-optimal performance over a larger range of batch sizes.
Extensive experiments with benchmarks from deep metric learning and

demonstrate that a high-entropy oxide is intrinsically capable of undergoing an
autonomous self-repairing process. Transmission electron microscopy revealed
that the spinel structure of (AlCoCrCu0.5FeNi)3O4 can regrow and repair itself
at the atomic level when damaged. Density functional theory calculations reveal
that the extra enthalpy stored in the high entropy material during fabrication
can be released to effectively heal macroscopic defects by regrowing into a
partially ordered state. This extraordinary self-repairing phenomenon makes
this new material highly desirable as a coating, enabling structures used in
harsh environments to better withstand damage, such as cosmic irradiation in

establish a category-representation object dictionary for expressive visual

audiovisual consistency as the supervision to achieve fine-grained audio and

complexity, creating the need for richer statistical models. This trend is also
true for economic data, where high-dimensional and nonlinear/nonparametric
inference is the norm in several fields of applied econometric work. The
purpose of this paper is to introduce the reader to the world of Bayesian model
determination, by surveying modern shrinkage and variable selection algorithms
and methodologies. Bayesian inference is a natural probabilistic framework for
quantifying uncertainty and learning about model parameters, and this feature
is particularly important for inference in modern models of high dimensions and
increased complexity.
  We begin with a linear regression setting in order to introduce various
classes of priors that lead to shrinkage/sparse estimators of comparable value
to popular penalized likelihood estimators (e.g.\ ridge, lasso). We explore
various methods of exact and approximate inference, and discuss their pros and
cons. Finally, we explore how priors developed for the simple regression
setting can be extended in a straightforward way to various classes of
interesting econometric models. In particular, the following case-studies are
considered, that demonstrate application of Bayesian shrinkage and variable
selection strategies to popular econometric contexts: i) vector autoregressive
models; ii) factor models; iii) time-varying parameter regressions; iv)
confounder selection in treatment effects models; and v) quantile regression
models. A MATLAB package and an accompanying technical manual allow the reader
to replicate many of the algorithms described in this review.

$[0,1)$ possesses Poissonian pair correlations (PPC). Vice versa, it has been
proven that a sequence with PPC is uniformly distributed. Grepstad and Larcher
gave an explicit upper bound for the discrepancy of a sequence given that it
has PPC. As a first result, we generalize here their result to the case of
$\alpha$-pair correlations with $0 < \alpha < 1$. Since the highest possible
level of uniformity is achieved by low-discrepancy sequences it is tempting to
assume that there are examples of such sequences which also have PPC. Although
there are no such known examples, we prove that every low-discrepancy sequence
has at least $\alpha$-pair correlations for $0 < \alpha <1$. According to
Larcher and Stockinger, the reason why many known classes of low-discrepancy
sequences fail to have PPC is their finite gap property. In this article, we
furthermore show that the discrepancy of a sequence with the finite gap
property plus a condition on the distribution of the different gap lengths can
be estimated. As a concrete application of this estimation, we re-prove the
fact that van der Corput and Kronecker sequences are low-discrepancy sequences.
Consequently, it follows from the finite gap property that these sequences have
$\alpha$-pair correlations for $0 < \alpha < 1$.

compressed sensing, image restoration, matrix/tensor recovery, and non-negative
matrix factorization can be cast as constrained optimization. Projected
gradient descent is a simple yet efficient method for solving such constrained
optimization problems. Local convergence analysis furthers our understanding of
its asymptotic behavior near the solution, offering sharper bounds on the
convergence rate compared to global convergence analysis. However, local
guarantees often appear scattered in problem-specific areas of machine learning
and signal processing. This manuscript presents a unified framework for the
local convergence analysis of projected gradient descent in the context of
constrained least squares. The proposed analysis offers insights into pivotal
local convergence properties such as the conditions for linear convergence, the
region of convergence, the exact asymptotic rate of convergence, and the bound
on the number of iterations needed to reach a certain level of accuracy. To
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, we present a recipe for
the convergence analysis of projected gradient descent and demonstrate it via a
beginning-to-end application of the recipe on four fundamental problems,
namely, linear equality-constrained least squares, sparse recovery, least
squares with the unit norm constraint, and matrix completion.

porous medium with a random structure. The permeability range for 12,000
realizations of a random porous structure is examined using a
recently-developed modelling approach, which results in up to two orders of
magnitude permeability variations in low porosities. These findings are
compared with previous results for 13,000 realizations with a scaled-down size,
and it is shown that the permeability histogram does not converge towards a
narrower spectrum using larger domain sizes. The similarity between advective
transport in an ensemble of porous media and a random walk phenomenon, accepted
in the literature, is revisited and the inadequacy of the assumptions employed
is discussed. It is shown that the conventional definition of advective
transport in a porous medium, which is generally assumed to follow Hadamard's
definition of well-posedness, cannot be realised. The reconstruction of a
porous structure from macroscopic parameters is in itself an ill-posed inverse
problem. To clarify this issue, explaining the ontic and epistemic
identifications of a porous medium, it is discussed that while ontic
identification cannot be employed for transport analysis, epistemic
identification leads to non-unique solutions. It is finally suggested that a
paradigm shift is required for better formulation of the transport
characteristics of porous media.

(IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), and is expected to play a significant
role in the upcoming era of AI. However, affected by the complexity of indoor
environments, it is still highly challenging to achieve continuous and reliable
indoor positioning. Currently, 5G cellular networks are being deployed
worldwide, the new technologies of which have brought the approaches for
improving the performance of wireless indoor positioning. In this paper, we
investigate the indoor positioning under the 5G new radio (NR), which has been
standardized and being commercially operated in massive markets. Specifically,
a solution is proposed and a software defined receiver (SDR) is developed for
indoor positioning. With our SDR indoor positioning system, the 5G NR signals
are firstly sampled by universal software radio peripheral (USRP), and then,
coarse synchronization is achieved via detecting the start of the
synchronization signal block (SSB). Then, with the assistance of the pilots
transmitted on the physical broadcasting channel (PBCH), multipath acquisition
and delay tracking are sequentially carried out to estimate the time of arrival
(ToA) of received signals. Furthermore, to improve the ToA ranging accuracy,
the carrier phase of the first arrived path is estimated. Finally, to quantify
the accuracy of our ToA estimation method, indoor field tests are carried out
in an office environment, where a 5G NR base station (known as gNB) is
installed for commercial use. Our test results show that, in the static test
scenarios, the ToA accuracy measured by the 1-{\sigma} error interval is about
0.5 m, while in the pedestrian mobile environment, the probability of range
accuracy within 0.8 m is 95%.

  Conversational Recommendation","Accepted by WWW2022 conference",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conversational recommendation system (CRS) is able to obtain fine-grained and
dynamic user preferences based on interactive dialogue. Previous CRS assumes
that the user has a clear target item. However, for many users who resort to
CRS, they might not have a clear idea about what they really like.
Specifically, the user may have a clear single preference for some attribute
types (e.g. color) of items, while for other attribute types, the user may have
multiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple
acceptable attribute instances (e.g. black and red) of one attribute type.
Therefore, the users could show their preferences over items under multiple
combinations of attribute instances rather than a single item with unique
combination of all attribute instances. As a result, we first propose a more
realistic CRS learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round
Conversational Recommendation, where users may have multiple interests in
attribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially
overlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with the
new CRS learning setting, in this paper, we propose a novel learning framework
namely, Multi-Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning . In order
to obtain user preferences more efficiently, the agent generates multi-choice
questions rather than binary yes/no ones on specific attribute instance.
Besides, we propose a union set strategy to select candidate items instead of
existing intersection set strategy in order to overcome over-filtering items
during the conversation. Finally, we design a Multi-Interest Policy Learning
module, which utilizes captured multiple interests of the user to decide next
action, either asking attribute instances or recommending items. Extensive
experimental results on four datasets verify the superiority of our method for
the proposed setting.

attention has focused on mitigating COVID-19 burden among adults. However, a
tragic consequence of adult deaths is that high numbers of children might lose
their parents and caregivers to COVID-19-associated deaths.
  Methods: We quantified COVID-19-associated caregiver loss and orphanhood in
the US and for each state using fertility and excess and COVID-19 mortality
data. We assessed burden and rates of COVID-19-associated orphanhood and deaths
of custodial and co-residing grandparents, overall and by race/ethnicity. We
further examined variations in COVID-19-associated orphanhood by race/ethnicity
for each state.
  Results: We found that from April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021, over 140,000
children in the US experienced the death of a parent or grandparent caregiver.
The risk of such loss was 1.1 to 4.5 times higher among children of racial and
ethnic minorities, compared to Non-Hispanic White children. The highest burden
of COVID-19-associated death of parents and caregivers occurred in Southern
border states for Hispanic children, Southeastern states for Black children,
and in states with tribal areas for American Indian/Alaska Native populations.
  Conclusions: We found substantial disparities in distributions of
COVID-19-associated death of parents and caregivers across racial and ethnic
groups. Children losing caregivers to COVID-19 need care and safe, stable, and
nurturing families with economic support, quality childcare and evidence-based
parenting support programs. There is an urgent need to mount an evidence-based
comprehensive response focused on those children at greatest risk, in the
states most affected.

related areas. With the convolutional neural networks showing strong capability
in computer vision tasks, the performance of image denoising has also been
brought up by CNN based methods. Though CNN based image denoisers show
promising results on this task, most of the current CNN based methods try to
learn the mapping from noisy image to clean image directly, which lacks the
explicit exploration of prior knowledge of images and noises. Natural images
are observed to obey the reciprocal power law, implying the low-frequency band
of image tend to occupy most of the energy. Thus in the condition of AGWN
(additive gaussian white noise) deterioration, low-frequency band tend to
preserve a higher PSNR than high-frequency band. Considering the spatial
morphological consistency of different frequency bands, low-frequency band with
more fidelity can be used as a guidance to refine the more contaminated
high-frequency bands. Based on this thought, we proposed a novel network
architecture denoted as IGNet, in order to refine the frequency bands from low
to high in a progressive manner. Firstly, it decomposes the feature maps into
high- and low-frequency subbands using DWT (discrete wavelet transform)
iteratively, and then each low band features are used to refine the high band
features. Finally, the refined feature maps are processed by a decoder to
recover the clean result. With this design, more inter-frequency prior and
information are utilized, thus the model size can be lightened while still
perserves competitive results. Experiments on several public datasets show that
our model obtains competitive performance comparing with other state-of-the-art
methods yet with a lightweight structure.

develops computability theory without an explicit model of computation. This is
enabled by assuming an axiom equivalent to postulating a function $\phi$ to be
universal for the space $\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ ($\mathsf{CT}_\phi$, a
consequence of the constructivist axiom $\mathsf{CT}$), Markov's principle, and
at least the axiom of countable choice. Assuming $\mathsf{CT}$ and countable
choice invalidates the law of excluded middle, thereby also invalidating
classical intuitions prevalent in textbooks on computability. On the other
hand, results like Rice's theorem are not provable without a form of choice. In
contrast to existing work, we base our investigations in constructive type
theory with a separate, impredicative universe of propositions where countable
choice does not hold and thus a priori $\mathsf{CT}_{\phi}$ and the law of
excluded middle seem to be consistent. We introduce various parametric
strengthenings of $\mathsf{CT}_{\phi}$, which are equivalent to assuming
$\mathsf{CT}_\phi$ and an $S^m_n$ operator for $\phi$ like in the $S^m_n$
theorem. The strengthened axioms allow developing synthetic computability
theory without choice, as demonstrated by elegant synthetic proofs of Rice's
theorem. Moreover, they seem to be not in conflict with classical intuitions
since they are consequences of the traditional analytic form of $\mathsf{CT}$.
  Besides explaining the novel axioms and proofs of Rice's theorem we
contribute machine-checked proofs of all results in the Coq proof assistant.

different substrate orientations, namely: (100), (511), (311), (211), (322) and

systematically with substrate orientation, but that the pattern of variation is
almost identical for all three systems, and therefore largely independent of

the magnitude of mismatch. Simulations point to an important role for
edge-to-edge matching and defects such as stacking faults. An analysis of these

(LSTM) network based on the message as well as the past forward channel outputs
observed by the transmitter in a noisy fashion. The decoder uses a
bi-directional LSTM architecture along with a signal to noise ratio (SNR)-aware
attention NN to decode the message. The proposed code overcomes two major
shortcomings of the previously proposed DNN-based codes over channels with
passive output feedback: (i) the SNR-aware attention mechanism at the decoder
enables reliable application of the same trained NN over a wide range of SNR
values; (ii) curriculum training with batch-size scheduling is used to speed up
and stabilize training while improving the SNR-robustness of the resulting
code. We show that the DRF codes significantly outperform state-of-the-art in

compensation at the receiver, DRF codes learn to efficiently exploit knowledge
of the instantaneous fading amplitude (which is available to the encoder

Cauchy problem associated with a two-patch one-dimensional reaction-diffusion
model. It is assumed that each patch has a relatively well-defined structure
which is considered as homogeneous. A coupling interface condition between the
two patches is involved. We first study the spreading properties of solutions
in the case when the per capita growth rate in each patch is maximal at low
densities, a configuration which we call the KPP-KPP case, and which turns out
to have some analogies with the homogeneous KPP equation in the whole line.
Then, in the KPP-bistable case, we provide various conditions under which the
solutions show different dynamics in the bistable patch, that is, blocking,
virtual blocking (propagation with speed zero), or spreading with positive
speed. Moreover, when propagation occurs with positive speed, a global
stability result is proved. Finally, the analysis in the KPP-bistable frame is
extended to the bistable-bistable case.

singular integrals on self-similar fractal sets. The integration domain
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is assumed to be the compact attractor of an iterated function
system of contracting similarities satisfying the open set condition.
Integration is with respect to any ``invariant'' (also known as ``balanced'' or
``self-similar'') measure supported on $\Gamma$, including in particular the
Hausdorff measure $\mathcal{H}^d$ restricted to $\Gamma$, where $d$ is the
Hausdorff dimension of $\Gamma$. Both single and double integrals are
considered. Our focus is on composite quadrature rules in which integrals over
$\Gamma$ are decomposed into sums of integrals over suitable partitions of
$\Gamma$ into self-similar subsets. For certain singular integrands of
logarithmic or algebraic type we show how in the context of such a partitioning
the invariance property of the measure can be exploited to express the singular
integral exactly in terms of regular integrals. For the evaluation of these
regular integrals we adopt a composite barycentre rule, which for sufficiently
regular integrands exhibits second-order convergence with respect to the
maximum diameter of the subsets. As an application we show how this approach,
combined with a singularity-subtraction technique, can be used to accurately
evaluate the singular double integrals that arise in Hausdorff-measure Galerkin
boundary element methods for acoustic wave scattering by fractal screens.

coefficients depending only on $f$. The numerical results presented in the
literature suggests that the effective conditions for the expansion to hold are
weaker and reduce to an even character of $f$, to a fixed smoothness, and to
its monotonicity over $[0,\pi]$. \\ In this note we investigate the
superposition caused over this expansion, when considering a linear combination
of symbols that is \[ \lambda_{j}\big(T_{n}(f_0)+\beta_{n}^{(1)} T_{n}(f_{1}) +
\beta_{n}^{(2)} T_{n}(f_{2}) +\cdots\big), \] where $
\beta_{n}^{(t)}=o\big(\beta_{n}^{(s)}\big)$ if $t>s$ and the symbols $f_{j}$

prove that the asymptotic expansion holds also in this setting under mild

opening the door to linear in time algorithms for the computation of
eigenvalues of large matrices of this type.
  The problem is of concrete interest in particular in the case where the
coefficients of the linear combination are functions of $h$, considering
spectral features of matrices stemming from the numerical approximation of
standard differential operators and distributed order fractional differential

Halpha, [N II], [S II]). All considered lines were fitted with two Gaussian
components: one which fits the core of the line, and another which fits the
wings. We gave the procedure for decomposition of Halpha+[N II] wavelength
band, for the spectra where these lines overlap. The influence of the
gravitational/non-gravitational kinematics to the line components is
investigated by comparing the dispersions of the line components with stellar
velocity dispersion. We found that wing components of all considered emission
lines have pure non-gravitational kinematics, the core components are
consistent with gravitational kinematics for the Halpha, [N II] and [S II]
lines, while in the [O III] there is evidence for contribution from
non-gravitational kinematics. We adopted the wing components as proxy of the
outflow contribution and we investigated the outflow kinematics by analysing
the correlations between widths and between shifts of the wing components of
different lines. We found the strong correlations between shifts and between
wing component widths of all considered lines, with exception of the Hbeta wing
component width. These correlations indicate that outflow dynamics systemically
affects all emission lines in spectrum. However, it reflects with different
strength in their profiles, which is observed as different widths of the wing
components. The strongest outflow signature is observed in the [O III] lines,

extract contextual information almost instantly, even from far away, image
resolution and computational resources limitations make detecting smaller

genuinely challenging task for machines and a wide-open research field. This
study explores how the popular YOLOv5 object detector can be modified to
improve its performance in detecting smaller objects, with a particular
application in autonomous racing. To achieve this, we investigate how replacing
certain structural elements of the model (as well as their connections and
other parameters) can affect performance and inference time. In doing so, we
propose a series of models at different scales, which we name `YOLO-Z', and
which display an improvement of up to 6.9% in mAP when detecting smaller
objects at 50% IOU, at the cost of just a 3ms increase in inference time
compared to the original YOLOv5. Our objective is to inform future research on
the potential of adjusting a popular detector such as YOLOv5 to address
specific tasks and provide insights on how specific changes can impact small
object detection. Such findings, applied to the broader context of autonomous

  Problem",,,,,"cs.DS math.CO math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The basic goal of survivable network design is to build cheap networks that
guarantee the connectivity of certain pairs of nodes despite the failure of a
few edges or nodes. A celebrated result by Jain [Combinatorica'01] provides a
2-approximation for a wide class of these problems. However nothing better is
known even for very basic special cases, raising the natural question whether
any improved approximation factor is possible at all.
  In this paper we address one of the most basic problems in this family for
which 2 is still the best-known approximation factor, the Forest Augmentation
Problem (FAP): given an undirected unweighted graph (that w.l.o.g. is a forest)
and a collection of extra edges (links), compute a minimum cardinality subset
of links whose addition to the graph makes it 2-edge-connected. Several
better-than-2 approximation algorithms are known for the special case where the
input graph is a tree, a.k.a. the Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP). Recently
this was achieved also for the weighted version of TAP, and for the
k-edge-connectivity generalization of TAP. These results heavily exploit the
fact that the input graph is connected, a condition that does not hold in FAP.
  In this paper we breach the 2-approximation barrier for FAP. Our result is
based on two main ingredients. First, we describe a reduction to the Path
Augmentation Problem (PAP), the special case of FAP where the input graph is a
collection of disjoint paths. Our reduction is not approximation preserving,
however it is sufficiently accurate to improve on a factor 2 approximation.
Second, we present a better-than-2 approximation algorithm for PAP, an open
problem on its own. Here we exploit a novel notion of implicit credits which
might turn out to be helpful in future related work.

self-organise into planar, hexagonally ordered clusters which hover over the

symmetric and asymmetric arrangements of isotropic droplets and is therefore
not caused by torques due to geometric asymmetries. We found, however, that
individual droplets exhibit a helical swimming mode in a small window of
intermediate activity in a force-free bulk medium. We show that by forming an
ordered cluster, the droplets cooperatively suppress their chaotic dynamics and
turn the transient instability into a steady rotational state. We analyse the
collective rotational dynamics as a function of droplet activity and cluster

caused by a cooperative coupling between the rotational modes of individual

The expressions of charge and heat transport coefficients are obtained by
solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time

have observed that $\sigma_{\rm el}$ and $\kappa_0$ decrease and $\sigma_{\rm

regime. On the other hand, the presence of a finite chemical potential
increases these transport coefficients. The effects of weak magnetic field and
finite chemical potential on aforesaid transport coefficients are found to be
more conspicuous at low temperatures, whereas at high temperatures, they have
only a mild dependence on magnetic field and chemical potential. We have found
that the presence of finite chemical potential further extends the lifetime of

electron cloud is boosted by the dark matter and emits an electron when it is

atomic form factors are much more complicate than the naive consideration. The
results of the relativistic Hartree-Fock(RHF) method give non-trivial shapes of
the atoms. The detailed calculation of the recoil of the electron cloud, the

explore task offloading when system-side information is given (e.g., server

uncertainty. But both generally fall short to handle task placement involving
many coexisting users in a dynamic and uncertain environment. In this paper, we
develop a multi-user offloading framework considering unknown yet stochastic

placement. Specifically, we formulate the dynamic task placement as an online
multi-user multi-armed bandit process, and propose a decentralized epoch based
offloading (DEBO) to optimize user rewards which are subjected under network
delay. We show that DEBO can deduce the optimal user-server assignment, thereby
achieving a close-to-optimal service performance and tight O(log T) offloading
regret. Moreover, we generalize DEBO to various common scenarios such as
unknown reward gap, dynamic entering or leaving of clients, and fair reward
distribution, while further exploring when users' offloaded tasks require
heterogeneous computing resources. Particularly, we accomplish a sub-linear
regret for each of these instances. Real measurements based evaluations
corroborate the superiority of our offloading schemes over state-of-the-art
approaches in optimizing delay-sensitive rewards.

invaluable information on the underlying parton distributions in nuclei,

enable a well-controlled kinematic scan (over momentum fraction $x$ and probing
scale $Q^2$) of the nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), i.e.,
$f^\textrm{A}_i(x,Q^2)$. In this work, we study several types of
triple-differential cross sections for dijet production in proton-proton ($pp$)
and proton-lead ($p$Pb) collisions at the LHC, to next-to-leading order within
the framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). Four sets of nPDF
parametrizations, EPPS16, nCTEQ15, TUJU19, and nIMParton16 are employed in the
calculations for $p$Pb collisions. We show that the observable nuclear
modification factor $R_{p\textrm{Pb}}$ of such cross sections can serve as a
nice image of the nuclear modifications on parton distributions, quantified by
the ratio
$r^{\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2)\!=\!f^\textrm{A,proton}_i(x,Q^2)/f^\textrm{proton}_i(x,Q^2)$.
Considerable differences among the $R_{p\textrm{Pb}}$ predicted by the four
nPDF sets can be observed and intuitively understood. Future measurements of
such observables are expected to not only constrain the nPDF parametrizations,
but also help confirm various nuclear effects, e.g., shadowing, anti-shadowing,
EMC, and Fermi motion in different regions of $x$ and their variations with
probing scale $Q^2$.

Heating the pipeline results in losing a certain fraction of the heat to the

soil. However, the amount of heat lost in conduction versus convection and the
transition from conduction to convection-dominated heat loss remains unknown.
Soil permeability, temperature gradient between cable and mudline, and burial
depth influence the mode of heat transfer and the amount of heat lost. We study
the dominant mode of heat transfer in pipelines with inductive heating using 2D
Finite Difference analysis under different soil and environmental conditions.
Low permeability soils primarily exhibit conductive heat transfer, thus losing
minimum heat to the surrounding soil. In contrast, convective flow drives a
significant fraction of the heat away from the pipeline and towards the ground
surface for highly permeable soils, barely heating the fluid in the pipe. We
identify a critical Rayleigh-Darcy number of 1 as the controlling value
separating conduction and convection-dominated heat transfer. An increase in
burial depth deteriorates the heating efficiency in convection-dominated high
permeability soils, while it remains unaffected in conduction-dominated low

anisotropy exhibited by the components of the diffusion tensor for cases with
an ordered magnetic field component. The predictive power of the classical
scattering relation as a description for the relation between the parallel and
perpendicular diffusion coefficients is discussed and compared to numerical
simulations. Very good agreement for a large parameter space is found,
transforming classical scattering relation predictions into a computational
prescription for the perpendicular component. We discuss and compare these
findings and in particular the time scales to become diffusive with the time
scales that particles reside in astronomical environments, the so-called escape
time scales. The results show that, especially at high energies, the escape
times obtained from diffusion coefficients may exceed the time scales required

start reminding some necessary fundamentals of linear algebra, including the
definitions of Hilbert space, tensor state, the definition of linear operator
and then we briefly present the principles of quantum mechanics on which this
thesis is grounded. After having reviewed the literature of QWs and the main
historical approaches to their study, we then move on to consider a new
property of QWs, the plasticity. Plastic QWs are those ones admitting both
continuous time-discrete space and continuous spacetime time limit. We show
that such QWs can be used to quantum simulate a large class of physical
phenomena described by transport equations. We investigate this new family of
QWs in one and two spatial dimensions, showing that in two dimensions, the PDEs
we can simulate are more general and include dispersive terms. We show that the
above results do not need to rely on the grid and we prove that such QW-based
quantum simulators can be defined on 2-complex simplicia, i.e. triangular
lattices. Finally, we extend the above result to any arbitrary triangulation,
proving that such QWs coincide in the continuous limit to a transport equation
on a general curved surface, including the curved Dirac equation in 2+1
spacetime dimensions.

bypassing pessimistic lower bounds in competitive analysis. In this model,
online algorithms are supplied with future predictions, and the goal is for the
competitive ratio to smoothly interpolate between the best offline and online
bounds as a function of the prediction error. In this paper, we study online
graph problems with predictions. Our contributions are the following:
  * The first question is defining prediction error. For graph/metric problems,
there can be two types of error, locations that are not predicted, and
locations that are predicted but the predicted and actual locations do not
coincide exactly. We design a novel definition of prediction error called
metric error with outliers to simultaneously capture both types of errors,
which thereby generalizes previous definitions of error that only capture one
of the two error types.
  * We give a general framework for obtaining online algorithms with
predictions that combines, in a ""black box"" fashion, existing online and
offline algorithms, under certain technical conditions. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first general-purpose tool for obtaining online
algorithms with predictions.
  * Using our framework, we obtain tight bounds on the competitive ratio of
several classical graph problems as a function of metric error with outliers:
Steiner tree, Steiner forest, priority Steiner tree/forest, and
uncapacitated/capacitated facility location.
  Both the definition of metric error with outliers and the general framework
for combining offline and online algorithms are not specific to the problems
that we consider in this paper. We hope that these will be useful for future
work in this domain.

be used to automatically determine a baseline performance threshold. These

and accurate detection of brain metastases is very essential for treatment
planning and prognosis in radiation therapy. To improve brain metastasis
detection performance with deep learning, a custom detection loss called
volume-level sensitivity-specificity (VSS) is proposed, which rates individual
metastasis detection sensitivity and specificity in (sub-)volume levels. As
sensitivity and precision are always a trade-off in a metastasis level, either
a high sensitivity or a high precision can be achieved by adjusting the weights
in the VSS loss without decline in dice score coefficient for segmented
metastases. To reduce metastasis-like structures being detected as false
positive metastases, a temporal prior volume is proposed as an additional input
of DeepMedic. The modified network is called DeepMedic+ for distinction. Our
proposed VSS loss improves the sensitivity of brain metastasis detection for
DeepMedic, increasing the sensitivity from 85.3% to 97.5%. Alternatively, it
improves the precision from 69.1% to 98.7%. Comparing DeepMedic+ with DeepMedic
with the same VSS loss, 44.4% of the false positive metastases are reduced in
the high sensitivity model and the precision reaches 99.6% for the high
specificity model. The mean dice coefficient for all metastases is about 0.81.
With the ensemble of the high sensitivity and high specificity models, on
average only 1.5 false positive metastases per patient needs further check,
while the majority of true positive metastases are confirmed. The ensemble
learning is able to distinguish high confidence true positive metastases from
metastases candidates that require special expert review or further follow-up,
being particularly well-fit to the requirements of expert support in real
clinical practice.

respectively. It is known that the hierarchy between the two branching ratios
($B_L \gg B_\phi$ or $B_\phi\gg B_L$), is sensitive to the generation of
adequate CP violation and efficiency of leptogenesis. Working in a hierarchical
limit of branching ratios and requiring adequate CP violation, we find the mass
of the lightest triplet can be as low as $2 \times 10^{10}$ GeV. In the
temperature regime, $\left[ 10^{9}, 10^{12} \right]$ GeV, flavor effects,

observed that adequate baryon asymmetry can not be obtained for purely flavored
leptogenesis, which corresponds to the hierarchical branching ratios, $B_L \gg
B_\phi$. But the hierarchy on the other way $B_\phi \gg B_L$ still allows
successful baryogenesis through leptogenesis. The phase of the complex vacuum

paradigm due to their robustness, but are restricted to bounding box tracking
and a limited range of transformation models, which reduces their localization
accuracy. We propose a discriminative single-shot segmentation tracker -- D3S2,
which narrows the gap between visual object tracking and video object
segmentation. A single-shot network applies two target models with
complementary geometric properties, one invariant to a broad range of
transformations, including non-rigid deformations, the other assuming a rigid
object to simultaneously achieve robust online target segmentation. The overall
tracking reliability is further increased by decoupling the object and feature
scale estimation. Without per-dataset finetuning, and trained only for
segmentation as the primary output, D3S2 outperforms all published trackers on
the recent short-term tracking benchmark VOT2020 and performs very close to the
state-of-the-art trackers on the GOT-10k, TrackingNet, OTB100 and LaSoT. D3S2
outperforms the leading segmentation tracker SiamMask on video object
segmentation benchmarks and performs on par with top video object segmentation
algorithms.

  version, to appear in Mathematical Research Letters",,,,"math.NT math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This is the second article in a two-part project whose aim is to study
algebraic and analytic ranks in $p$-adic families of modular forms. Let $f$ be
a newform of weight $2$, square-free level $N$ and trivial character, let $A_f$
be the abelian variety attached to $f$, whose dimension will be denoted by
$d_f$, and for every prime number $p\nmid N$ let $\boldsymbol f^{(p)}$ be a
$p$-adic Coleman family through $f$ over a suitable open disc in the $p$-adic
weight space. We prove that, for all but finitely many primes $p$ as above, if
$A_f(\mathbb Q)$ has rank $r\in\{0,d_f\}$ and the $p$-primary part of the
Shafarevich-Tate group of $A_f$ over $\mathbb Q$ is finite, then all classical
specializations of $\boldsymbol f^{(p)}$ of weight congruent to $2$ modulo
$2(p-1)$ and trivial character have finite $p$-primary Shafarevich-Tate group
and $r/d_f$-dimensional image of the relevant $p$-adic \'etale Abel-Jacobi map.
As a second contribution, assuming the non-degeneracy of certain height
pairings \`a la Gillet-Soul\'e between Heegner cycles, we show that, for all
but finitely many $p$, if $f$ has analytic rank $r\in\{0,1\}$, then all
classical specializations of $\boldsymbol f^{(p)}$ of weight congruent to $2$
modulo $2(p-1)$ and trivial character have analytic rank $r$. This result
provides some evidence for a conjecture of Greenberg on analytic ranks in
families of modular forms.

navigate its content when seeking information. To bridge this gap, we present
the first systematic large-scale analysis of how readers browse Wikipedia.
Using billions of page requests from Wikipedia's server logs, we measure how
readers reach articles, how they transition between articles, and how these
patterns combine into more complex navigation paths. We find that navigation
behavior is characterized by highly diverse structures. Although most
navigation paths are shallow, comprising a single pageload, there is much
variety, and the depth and shape of paths vary systematically with topic,
device type, and time of day. We show that Wikipedia navigation paths commonly
mesh with external pages as part of a larger online ecosystem, and we describe
how naturally occurring navigation paths are distinct from targeted navigation
in lab-based settings. Our results further suggest that navigation is abandoned
when readers reach low-quality pages. Taken together, these insights contribute
to a more systematic understanding of readers' information needs and allow for
improving their experience on Wikipedia and the Web in general.

a variety of binary neutron star detections and numerous possibilities for

clear understanding of the merger process and the possibility of prompt black
hole formation after merger is important, as the amount of ejected material
strongly depends on the merger dynamics. These dynamics are primarily affected
by the total mass of the binary, however, the mass ratio also influences the
postmerger evolution. To determine the effect of the mass ratio, we investigate
the parameter space around the prompt-collapse threshold with a new set of
fully relativistic simulations. The simulations cover three equations of state
and seven mass ratios in the range of $1.0 \leq q \leq 1.75$, with five to
seven simulations of binary systems of different total mass in each case. The
threshold mass is determined through an empirical relation based on the
collapse-time, which allows us to investigate effects of the mass-ratio on the
threshold mass and also on the properties of the remnant system. Furthermore,
we model effects of mass ratio and equation of state on tidal parameters of
threshold configurations.

is at the core of shape modeling techniques. Firstly, we propose a new kernel
based on geodesic distances for the Gaussian Process Morphable Models (GPMMs)
framework. The use of geodesic distances into the kernel makes it more adapted
to the topological and geometric characteristics of the surface and leads to
more realistic deformations around holes and curved areas. Since the kernel
possesses hyperparameters we have optimized them for the task of face
registration on the FaceWarehouse dataset. We show that the Geodesic squared
exponential kernel performs significantly better than state of the art kernels
for the task of face registration on all the 20 expressions of the
FaceWarehouse dataset. Secondly, we propose a modification of the loss function
used in the non-rigid ICP registration algorithm, that allows to weight the
correspondences according to the confidence given to them. As a use case, we
show that we can make the registration more robust to outliers in the 3D scans,

astronomical and theoretical spectroscopic parameters. The column density of
HCCS+ is (1.1+/-0.1)e12 cm-2, and the CCS/HCCS+ abundance ratio is 50+/-10,

Majorana bound states (MBSs) by combining topological superconductivity with
quantum optics in a superconducting $pn$ junction containing a quantum dot
(QD). We consider a topological superconductor (TSC) hosting two Majorana bound
states at its boundary ($n$ side). Within an effective low-energy model, the
MBSs are coherently tunnel-coupled to a spin-split electron level on the QD
which is placed close to one of the MBSs. Holes on the QD are tunnel-coupled to
a normal conducting reservoir ($p$ side). Via electron-hole recombination,
photons in the optical range are emitted, which have direct information on the
MBS-properties through the recombined electrons. Using a master equation
approach, we calculate the polarization-resolved photon emission intensities
(PEIs). In the weak coupling regime between MBSs and QD, we find an analytical
expression for the PEI which allows to clearly distinguish the cases of well
separated MBSs at zero energy from overlapping MBSs. For separated MBSs, the
Majorana spinor-polarization is given by the relative widths of the two PEI
peaks associated with the two spin states on the QD. For overlapping MBSs, a
coupling to the distant (nonlocal) MBS causes a shift of the emission peaks.
Additionally, we show that quasiparticle poisoning (QP) influences the PEI
drastically and changes its shot noise from super-Poissonian to sub-Poissonian.
In the strong coupling regime, more resonances emerge in the PEI due to
spin-mixing effects. Finally, we comment on how our proposal could be
implemented using a Majorana nanowire.

the experimentally more demanding lattice modulation spectroscopy and find good
agreement for our parameter regime. Our experiments are compatible with a
dependence of the NCPR with $a_s$, as theoretically expected in the case of
strongly dipolar gases. Surprisingly, we experimentally observe a dependency of
the NCPR on the density, which might arise due to deviations from an ideal
harmonic trapping configuration. Finally, we apply a model for the dependency
of the background scattering length with the isotope mass, allowing to estimate
the number of bound states of erbium.

elements by developing a universal style representation for each font style.
However, this approach limits the model in representing diverse local styles,
because it is unsuitable for complicated letter systems, for example, Chinese,
whose characters consist of a varying number of components (often called
""radical"") -- with a highly complex structure. In this paper, we propose a
novel font generation method that learns localized styles, namely
component-wise style representations, instead of universal styles. The proposed
style representations enable the synthesis of complex local details in text
designs. However, learning component-wise styles solely from a few reference
glyphs is infeasible when a target script has a large number of components, for
example, over 200 for Chinese. To reduce the number of required reference
glyphs, we represent component-wise styles by a product of component and style
factors, inspired by low-rank matrix factorization. Owing to the combination of
strong representation and a compact factorization strategy, our method shows
remarkably better few-shot font generation results (with only eight reference
glyphs) than other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, strong locality

molecular masers in the Galaxy. The aim of the present calculations is to
explore a larger region of parameter space to improve on our previous
calculations, thereby to better understand the range of physical conditions
under which an inversion of the 4.8 GHz transition occurs. We solve the rate
equations of the first 40 rotational levels of o-formaldehyde using a
fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. We consider gas kinetic temperatures between
10 K and 300 K, H_2 densities between 10^4 and 10^6 per cc, and a number of
different dust temperatures and grey-body spectral energy density
distributions. Using a grey-body dust radiation field appropriate for Arp 220
we find that none of 4.8 GHz, 14 GHz, and 28 GHz transitions are inverted for
kinetic temperatures less than 100 K. Our calculations also show that in theory
the 4.8 GHz transition can be inverted over a large region of explored
parameter space in the presence of an external far-infrared radiation field.
Limiting the abundance of o-formaldehyde to less than 10^{-5}, however, reduces
the region where an inversion occurs to H_2 densities > 10^5 per cc and kinetic
temperatures >100 K. We propose a pumping scheme for the formaldehyde masers
which can explain why collisions play a central role in inverting the 4.8 GHz
transition, and therefore why an external radiation field alone does not lead
to an inversion. Collisions are an essential mechanism for the inversion of the

practice -- it is easy to visualize and it is one of the main outputs of
current multiparameter persistent homology software, such as RIVET. However, to
the best of our knowledge, no bottleneck stability result with respect to the
interleaving distance has been established for this invariant so far, and this
potential lack of stability limits its practical applications. We prove a
stability result for multigraded Betti numbers, using an efficiently computable
bottleneck-type dissimilarity function we introduce. Our notion of matching is
inspired by recent work on signed barcodes, and allows matching bars of the

disease of the central nervous system affecting over 2.5 million people

measure to evaluate the progression of MS. Yet, it has limitations such as the
need for a clinical visit and a proper walkway. The widespread use of wearable
devices capable of depicting patients activity profiles has the potential to
assess the level of MS-induced disability in free-living conditions. In this
work, we extracted 96 activity features in different temporal granularities
(from minute-level to day-level) and explored their utility in estimating 6MWT
scores in a European (Italy, Spain, and Denmark) MS cohort of 337 participants
over an average of 10-month duration. We combined these features with
participant demographics using three regression models including elastic net,
gradient boosted trees and random forest. In addition, we quantified the
individual feature contribution using feature importance in these regression
models, linear mixed-effects models, generalized estimating equations, and
correlation-based feature selection (CFS). The results showed promising
estimation performance with R2 of 0.30, which was derived using random forest
after CFS. This model was able to distinguish the participants with low
disability from those with high disability. Furthermore, we observed that the
minute-level (no longer than 8 minutes) step count, particularly those
capturing the upper end of the step count distribution, had a stronger
association with 6MWT. The use of a walking aid was indicative of ambulatory
function measured through 6MWT. This study provides a basis for future
investigation into the clinical relevance and utility of wearables in assessing

shortest path problem, known as the single-source many-targets shortest path
problem (SSMTSP). Given a directed graph with non-negative edge weights, our
goal is to compute a shortest path from a given source node to any of several
target nodes. Basically, our idea is to equip an adapted version of Dijkstras
algorithm with machine learning predictions to solve this problem: Based on the
trace of the algorithm, we design a neural network that predicts the shortest
path distance after a few iterations. The prediction is then used to prune the
search space explored by Dijkstras algorithm, which may significantly reduce
the number of operations on the underlying priority queue. We note that our
algorithm works independently of the specific method that is used to arrive at
such predictions. Crucially, we require that our algorithm always computes an
optimal solution (independently of the accuracy of the prediction) and provides
a certificate of optimality. As we show, in the worst-case this might force our
algorithm to use the same number of queue operations as Dijkstras algorithm,
even if the prediction is correct. In general, however, our algorithm may save
a significant fraction of the priority queue operations. We derive structural
insights that allow us to lower bound these savings on partial random
instances. In these instances, an adversary can fix the instance arbitrarily
except for the weights of a subset of relevant edges, which are chosen
randomly. Our bound shows that the number of relevant edges which are pruned
increases as the prediction error decreases. We then use these insights to
derive closed-form expressions of the expected number of saved queue operations
on random instances.

factors $\nu_\mathrm{dot} \gtrsim 2/3$, $1/3$. Depending on the internal
filling factor, edge reconstruction inside the quantum dot leads to the
formation of multiple concentric compressible regions, which contain discrete
charge and are separated by incompressible rings. Quasiparticle tunneling
between different compressible regions results in
magnetic-field-(pseudo)-periodic modulations of the Coulomb resonances with
different periodicities, additional super-periodicity or non-periodic features.
The evolution of the period in magnetic field indicates cyclic depopulation of
the inner compressible regions close to integer filing factors. We study the
temperature dependence of the conductance resonances for different magnetic
fields. While at low fields, the resonance amplitude decays inversely with
temperature, corresponding to single-level transport, the temperature
dependence of the amplitude evolves continuously into a linearly increasing
behavior for dot filling factor $2> \nu_\mathrm{dot} > 1$. This coincides with
a reduction of the charging energy by approximately a factor of 2 in the same
regime. At zero magnetic field, the temperature dependence differs for
individual resonances, and is found to depend on the closeness to quantum dot
states that couple strongly to the leads. The presented experiments complement
and extend previous results on internal rearrangements of quasiparticles for

maximize its sum-rate via the joint optimization of beamforming at the BS and
phase shifts at the RIS. However, the multi-user MIMO transmissions and the
spatial correlations make the optimization cumbersome. For tractability, a
deterministic approximation is derived for the sum-rate under a large number of
the reflecting elements. By adopting the approximate sum-rate for maximization,
the optimal designs of the transmit beamforming and the phase shifts can be
decoupled and solved in closed-forms individually. More specifically, the
global optimality of the transmit beamforming can be guaranteed by using the
water-filling algorithm and a sub-optimal solution of phase shifts can be
obtained by using the projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm. By comparing
to the case of the instantaneous CSI assumed at the BS, the proposed algorithm
based on statistical CSI can achieve comparable performance but with much lower
complexity and signaling overhead, which is more affordable and appealing for
practical applications. Moreover, the impact of spatial correlation is

by oblique, co-rotating envelopes are therefore expected to manifest periodic
linear polarimetric variations. The electron scattering magnetospheres of
magnetic massive stars are expected to be suitable candidates to observe this
effect. In this paper, we present the first semi-analytical model capable of
synthesizing the continuum polarimetric signatures of magnetic O-type stars in
an optically thin, single electron scattering limit. The purpose of this
investigation is to improve our general understanding of magnetic hot stars by
characterizing their polarimetric behaviour. Our linear polarization model is
constructed by combining the analytical expressions for the polarimetric
variations of an obliquely rotating envelope with the Analytic Dynamical
Magnetosphere model to represent a physical model for the envelope density
structure. We compute grids of model Stokes $Q$ and $U$ curves and show that
their shapes are unique to the choice of inclination and obliquity angles. We
apply our model to HD 191612, a prototypical Of?p-type star, having both
polarimetric and photometric observations. We find that the polarimetric
modulations are best reproduced with $i=19^{+12}_{-3}$$^\circ$,
$\beta=71^{+3}_{-9}$$^\circ$, and $\log \dot{M}_{B=0}=-6.11^{+0.12}_{-0.06}$

the lack of evidence of Kalb-Ramond (KR) field, in particular in the present

bounce scenario in the evolution of the Universe strongly advocates their
elusiveness, even if their energy density was very large to start with. We
consider the Kalb-Ramond field and its effects in the context of generalized
teleparallel gravity in (3+1) dimensions. Teleparallel gravity is a description
of gravitation in which the tetrads are the dynamical degrees of freedom, and
the torsion arising from fields with spin are accommodated naturally as field
strength tensors. In order to describe the coupling prescription, we address
the correct generalization of the Fock-Ivanenko derivative operator for an
n-form tensor field. By varying with respect to the tetrads, this rank-2 field
is shown to source the teleparallel equivalent of Einstein's equations. We
study the possibility of reproducing two well-known cosmological bounce
scenarios, namely, symmetric bounce and matter bounce in four-dimensional
spacetime with with the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric and observe
that the solution requires the KR field energy density to be localized near the
bounce. The crucial result in our work is that this feature also naturally
explains the lack of cosmological evidence of the rank-2 field in the present

cosmologies, latter is favored over the former.

various reinforcement learning algorithms and the lack of their systematic
comparison across different driving scenarios, we are unsure of which ones are
more effective for training autonomous car software in single-agent as well as
multi-agent driving environments. A benchmarking framework for the comparison
of deep reinforcement learning in a vision-based autonomous driving will open
up the possibilities for training better autonomous car driving policies. To
address these challenges, we provide an open and reusable benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation and comparative analysis of deep
reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous driving in a single- and
multi-agent environment. Using the framework, we perform a comparative study of
discrete and continuous action space deep reinforcement learning algorithms. We
also propose a comprehensive multi-objective reward function designed for the
evaluation of deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous driving agents. We
run the experiments in a vision-only high-fidelity urban driving simulated

example, A3C- and TD3-based autonomous cars perform comparatively better in

shared between Alice ($A$, encoder), Bob ($B$, decoder) and a reference ($R$).
Both Alice and Bob are required to output a system ($\widetilde{A}$ and

observable on $\widetilde{A}\widetilde{B}R$.
  It includes as special cases most quantum rate-distortion problems considered

measured per copy; furthermore, it generalises the well-known state merging and
quantum state redistribution tasks for a pure state source, with per-copy
fidelity, and a variant recently considered by us, where the source is an
ensemble of pure states [1], [2].
  We derive a single-letter formula for the rate-distortion function of
compression schemes assisted by free entanglement. A peculiarity of the formula
is that in general it requires optimisation over an unbounded auxiliary

interacting open quantum systems. Our starting point is an open quantum system
interacting with a single heat bath. For a given setup, we discuss that the
stationary state of the Davies-GKSL equation is thermodynamically inconsistent
with the presence of the Lamb-Stark shift term. For this reason, we postulate
the self-consistency condition for the dynamical equations. The condition fixes
the renormalization procedure and recovers the thermodynamical consistency. In
this way, we rederive the cumulant equation to illustrate how the
self-consistency condition enters the derivation of the dynamical equations.
The physical interpretation of the renormalization procedure is discussed in
terms of the Born approximation. Furthermore, we compare the Lamb-Stark shift
term (dynamical correction) with the second-order (static) correction to the
so-called mean-force (Gibbs state) Hamiltonian. The discrepancy between the
static and the dynamical correction questions the physical meaning of the
latter one. Finally, we formulate a simplified renormalization scheme that can
be directly applied to Davies-GKSL or Bloch-Redfield equations.

optimal behaviour of a principal and an agent, with the former contracting work
from the latter, in return for providing a monetary award. While this field
canonically considers a single agent, the situation where multiple agents, or
even an infinite amount of agents are contracted by a principal are growing in
prominence and pose interesting and realistic problems. Here, agents form a
Nash equilibrium among themselves, and a Stackelberg equilibrium between
themselves as a collective and the principal.
  We apply this framework to the problem of implementing Renewable Energy
Certificate (REC) markets, where the principal requires regulated firms (power
generators) to pay a non-compliance penalty which is inversely proportional to
the amount of RECs they have. RECs can be obtained by generating electricity
from clean sources or purchasing on the market. The agents react to this
penalty and optimize their behaviours to navigate the system at minimum cost.
In the agents' model we incorporate market clearing as well as agent
heterogeneity. For a given market design, we find the Nash equilibrium among
agents using techniques from mean field games. We then use techniques from
extended McKean-Vlasov control problems to solve the principal (regulators)
problem, who aim to choose the penalty function in such a way that balances
environmental and revenue impacts optimally. We find through these techniques
that the optimal penalty function is linear in the agents' state, suggesting
the optimal emissions regulation market is more akin to a tax or rebate,

than wireless sensors networks and require little maintenance, facilitating
years-long monitoring with ten's to thousands of tags. This study reviews the
existing and potential applications of RFID in geosciences. The most mature
application today is the study of coarse sediment transport in rivers or
coastal environments, using tags placed into pebbles. More recently, tag
localization was used to monitor landslide displacement, with a centimetric
accuracy. Sensing tags were used to detect a displacement threshold on unstable
rocks, to monitor the soil moisture or temperature, and to monitor the snowpack
temperature and snow water equivalent. RFID sensors, available today, could
monitor other parameters, such as the vibration of structures, the tilt of
unstable boulders, the strain of a material, or the salinity of water. Key
challenges for using RFID monitoring more broadly in geosciences include the
use of ground and aerial vehicles to collect data or localize tags, the
increase in reading range and duration, the ability to use tags placed under
ground, snow, water or vegetation, and the optimization of economical and
environmental cost. As a pattern, passive RFID could fill a gap between

galaxies formed and evolved, because a major part of their evolution occurs in
heavily dust enshrouded environments, especially at the so-called Cosmic Noon.
Using the calibrations of IR lines we predict the expected fluxes of lines and
features, with the aim to measure the star formation rate and the Black Hole
Accretion rate in intermediate to high redshift galaxies. The launch of the
James Webb Space Telescope will allow us a deep investigation of both the SF
and the BHA obscured processes as a function of cosmic time. We assess the
spectral lines and features that can be detected by JWST-MIRI in galaxies and
Active Galactic Nuclei up to redshift z= 3. We confirm the fine-structure lines
of [MgIV]4.49um and [ArVI]4.53um as good BHA rate tracers for the 1<z<3 range,
and we propose the [NeVI]7.65um line as the best tracer for redshifts of z<1.5.
We suggest the use of the [ArII]6.98um and [ArIII]8.99um lines to measure the
SF rate, for z<3 and z<2. At higher redshifts, the PAH features at 6.2um and
7.7um can be observed at z<3 and z<2.7 respectively. Rest-frame far-IR
spectroscopy is currently being collected in high redshift galaxies (z>3) with
the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. We confirm that the [CII]158um line is a
good tracer of the SF rate and can in most cases (0.9<z<2 and 3<z<9) be
observed, and we propose the use of the combination of [OIII]88um and [OI]145um
lines as an alternative SF rate tracer, that can be detected above z>3. We
conclude, however, that the current and foreseen facilities will not be able to
cover properly the peak of the obscured SF and BHA activities at the Cosmic
Noon of galaxy evolution and a new IR space telescope, actively cooled to
obtain very good sensitivities, covering the full IR spectral range from about
10um to 300um, will be needed.

characteristically rely heavily on repeated model simulations. However,
whenever the computational cost of simulation is even moderately expensive, the
significant burden incurred by likelihood-free algorithms leaves them unviable

(originally in the context of approximate Bayesian computation) to reduce the

using the information provided by simulating computationally cheap, approximate

is to demonstrate that multifidelity techniques can be applied in the general
likelihood-free Bayesian inference setting. Analytical results on the optimal
allocation of computational resources to simulations at different levels of

respectively, reveals a complex dynamical architecture of the system. Several
formation mechanisms for the PC system have been proposed.
  Our goal is to analyse the past and current orbital dynamics of the satellite
system. We study the past and current dynamics of the PC system through a large
set of numerical integrations of the exact equations of motion, accounting for
the gravitational interactions of the PC binary with the small moons and the
tidal evolution, modelled by the constant time lag approach. We construct the
stability maps in a pseudo-Jacobian coordinate system. In addition, considering
a more realistic model, which accounts for the zonal harmonic $J_2$ of the
Pluto's oblateness and the accreting mass of Charon, we investigate the tidal
evolution of the whole system.
  Our results show that, in the chosen reference frame, the current orbits of
all satellites are nearly circular, nearly planar and nearly resonant with
Charon that can be seen as an indicator of the convergent dissipative migration
experimented by the system in the past. We verify that, under the assumption
that Charon completes its formation during the tidal expansion, the moons can
safely cross the main MMRs, without their motions being strongly excited and
consequently ejected.
  In the more realistic scenario proposed here, the small moons survive the
tidal expansion of the PC binary, without having to invoke the hypothesis of
the resonant transport. Our results point out that the possibility to find
additional small moons in the PC system cannot be ruled out.

could not make use of the Gaia astrometry to define cluster members. We made
use of public and private photometry to select the stars to be observed with
FLAMES. Candidate target selection was based on ground-based proper motions,
radial velocities, and X-ray properties when appropriate, and it was mostly
used to define the position of the clusters' evolutionary sequences in the
colour-magnitude diagrams. Targets for GIRAFFE were selected near the sequences
in an unbiased way. We used available information on membership only for the
few UVES stars. We collected spectra for 62 confirmed OCs (a few more were
taken from the ESO archive). Among them are very young clusters, where the main
targets are pre-main sequence stars, clusters with very hot and massive stars
currently on the main sequence, intermediate-age and old clusters where evolved
stars are the main targets. The selection of targets was as inclusive and

the standard model. In the context of the low-energy effective theory, we find
that the anticipated BESIII measurements of the $B_1\to B_2\nu\bar\nu$ decays
would lead to constraints on new physics in the purely axial vector $\bar d
\gamma_\mu\gamma_5 s$ current that are stronger than the present limits from
their kaon siblings $K\to \pi\pi\nu\bar\nu$. On the other hand, although
hyperon decays into charged leptons are dominated by long-distance hadronic
contributions, angular observable such as the leptonic forward-backward
asymmetry is sensitive to the interference between long- and short-distance
contributions. We discuss the sensitivity to new physics of a potential
measurement of this observable in comparison with observables in the kaon
decays $K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $K^+\to\pi^+\mu^+\mu^-$. We conclude that the
current kaon bounds are a few orders of magnitude better than those that could
be obtained from $\Sigma^+\to p\mu^+\mu^-$ except for two scenarios with new
physics in the $(\bar d \gamma^\mu s)(\bar\ell\gamma_\mu\gamma_5\ell)$ and
$(\bar d \gamma^\mu \gamma_5s)(\bar\ell\gamma_\mu\ell)$ currents. Finally, we
point out that the loop effects from renormalization group evolution are
important in this context, when relating the low-energy effective field theory
to new physics models in the UV.

limiting cases--that of weak and strong nonideality with very different
physical properties. While the former is well described by the familiar theory

Here we study in detail the transition between both regimes. We focus on the
evolution of the dynamic structure factor of the magnetized one-component
plasma from weak to strong coupling, which is studied with first-principle
molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations show the vanishing of Bernstein
modes and the emergence of higher harmonics of the upper hybrid mode across the
magnetic field, a redistribution of spectral power between the two main
collective modes under oblique angles, and a suppression of plasmon damping
along the magnetic field. Comparison with results from various models,
including the random phase approximation, a Mermin-type dielectric function,

capable of reproducing the crossover that occurs when the coupling parameter is
on the order of unity. The findings are relevant to the scattering spectra,
stopping power, and transport coefficients of correlated magnetized plasmas.

limitation of a laser DFI is that its sensitive frequency band is too high for

neutron DFI, in which neutrons are used instead of light. Since neutrons have
velocities much lower than the speed of light, the sensitive frequency band of
a neutron DFI can be lowered down to $\sim 10^{-1}\,{\rm Hz}$. Therefore, a

spectral index at 4.7 GHz $\alpha_{4.7}=-0.59$ for the OHM sample, and
$\alpha_{4.7}=-0.71$ for the non-OHM galaxies. We confirm a tight correlation
of the far-infrared (FIR) and radio luminosities for the OHM sample. We found
correlations between isotropic OH line luminosity $L_{OH}$ and the spectral

insignificant differences for their FIR and radio properties. Nonetheless,
AGN-powered galaxies exhibit larger scatter in a range of parameters and their
standard deviations. The similarities in the radio and FIR properties in the

degrade system level performance of current day mixed-autonomy freeway

(RDAs), compromised vehicles create congestion waves in the traffic that
decrease average speed and network throughput. We use a detailed and realistic
traffic simulation environment to quantify the impacts of the attack on a model
of a real high-volume freeway in the United States. We find that the effect of
the attack depends both on the level of underlying traffic congestion, and what
percentage of ACC vehicles can be compromised. In moderate congestion regimes
the attack can degrade mean commuter speed by over 7%. In high density regimes
overall network throughput can be reduced by up to 3%. And, in moderate to high
congestion regimes, it can cost commuters on the network over 300 USD/km hr.
All of these results motivate that the proposed attack is able to significantly
degrade performance of the traffic network.
  We also develop an anomaly detection technique that uses GPS traces on
vehicles to identify malicious/compromised vehicles. We employ this technique
on data from the simulation experiments and find that it is unable to identify
compromised ACCs compared to benign/normal drivers. That is, these attacks are
stealthy to detection. Stronger attacks can be accurately labeled as malicious,
motivating that there is a limit to how impactful attacks can be before they
are no longer stealthy.
  Finally, we experimentally execute the attack on a real and commercially
available ACC vehicle, demonstrating the possible real world feasibility of an
RDA.

elusive, as the reported response times are typically limited by the device
geometry. Here, we use the two-pulse coincidence photoresponse technique to
identify the intrinsic response time of 1,2-ethanedithiol-functionalized PbS-NC
photodetectors after fs-pulsed 1560 nm excitation. We obtain an intrinsic
response time of ~1 ns, indicating an intrinsic bandwidth of ~0.55 GHz as the
material-specific limit. Examination of the dependence on laser power, gating,
bias, temperature, channel length and environmental conditions suggest that
Auger recombination, assisted by NC-surface defects, is the dominant mechanism.
Accordingly, the intrinsic response time might further be tuned by specifically
controlling the ligand coverage and trap states. Thus, PbS-NC photodetectors
are feasible for gigahertz optical communication in the third telecommunication

It took a year for Karl Schwarzschild to obtain the first exact solution of
Einstein's field equations since general theory of relativity was published.
The number of viable solutions has been growing since then. Many authors have
adopted several methods to obtain the solution. Different models have been
constructed for a variety of applications. To produce feasible models of
compact stars, a considerable amount of effort has been applied in gaining an
understanding of the properties of anisotropic matter. Theoretical study
indicates that pressure within compact stars with extreme internal density and

must be run backward in time for every gas measurement, and this can be
computationally prohibitive. To address this problem, here we develop a novel
spatio-temporal emulator for LPDM sensitivities that is built using a

CVAE, we obtain approximate (variational) posterior distributions over latent

through the decoder segment of the CVAE to yield emulated sensitivities. We
show that our CVAE-based emulator outperforms the more traditional emulator
built using empirical orthogonal functions and that it can be used with

reliably reduce the computing time needed to generate LPDM outputs for use in

consumption more frequently without visiting customers. In this study, we
construct a system to optimize plans for cylinder replacement, and evaluate it
with a large-scale field test. We propose an algorithm to create a replacement
plan with three steps: estimating the replacement date, acquiring the customer
list for replacement, and determining the delivery route. A more accurate
estimation of the replacement date can be acquired with a smart meter, which is
used for making a customer list for replacement. The formulation for making a
customer list enables the gas provider to replace cylinders some days before
the date when the gas would run out. It can suppress the concentration of
replacements on certain days. Large-scale verification experiments were
performed with more than 1,000 customers in Chiba prefecture in Japan. In the
field test, the gas provider incorporated the system into its replacement
operations. Moreover, the replacement plans developed by the proposed system
were compared with that by the gas provider. Our system reduced the number of
gas cylinders with gas shortage, the number of visits without replacement due
to plenty of gas remaining, and the working duration per customer, which shows
that our system benefits both gas providers and customers.

effective compounds is crucial to the success of drug discovery. While most
databases and machine-learning-based generation models aim to optimize
particular chemical properties, there is limited literature on how to properly
measure the coverage of the chemical space by those candidates included or
generated. This problem is challenging due to the lack of formal criteria to
select good measures of the chemical space. In this paper, we propose a novel
evaluation framework for measures of the chemical space based on two analyses:
an axiomatic analysis with three intuitive axioms that a good measure should
obey, and an empirical analysis on the correlation between a measure and a
proxy gold standard. Using this framework, we are able to identify #Circles, a
new measure of chemical space coverage, which is superior to existing measures
both analytically and empirically. We further evaluate how well the existing
databases and generation models cover the chemical space in terms of #Circles.
The results suggest that many generation models fail to explore a larger space
over existing databases, which leads to new opportunities for improving
generation models by encouraging exploration.

solutions in many combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the
attention-based encoder-decoder models show high effectiveness on various
routing problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Unfortunately, they perform poorly for the TSP with Drone (TSP-D), requiring
routing a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles in coordination -- a truck and a
drone. In TSP-D, the two vehicles are moving in tandem and may need to wait at
a node for the other vehicle to join. State-less attention-based decoder fails
to make such coordination between vehicles. We propose a hybrid model that uses
an attention encoder and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network decoder, in
which the decoder's hidden state can represent the sequence of actions made. We
empirically demonstrate that such a hybrid model improves upon a purely
attention-based model for both solution quality and computational efficiency.
Our experiments on the min-max Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (mmCVRP)
also confirm that the hybrid model is more suitable for the coordinated routing
of multiple vehicles than the attention-based model. The proposed model
demonstrates comparable results as the operations research baseline methods.

areas, including AI-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) network. AI analytics and
intelligent paradigms greatly improve learning efficiency and accuracy.
Applying these learning paradigms to network scenarios provide technical
advantages of new networking solutions. In this paper, we propose an improved
approach for IoT security from data perspective. The network traffic of IoT
devices can be analyzed using AI techniques. The Adversary Learning (AdLIoTLog)
model is proposed using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with attention mechanism
on sequences of network events in the network traffic. We define network events
as a sequence of the time series packets of protocols captured in the log. We
have considered different packets TCP packets, UDP packets, and HTTP packets in
the network log to make the algorithm robust. The distributed IoT devices can
collaborate to cripple our world which is extending to Internet of
Intelligence. The time series packets are converted into structured data by
removing noise and adding timestamps. The resulting data set is trained by RNN
and can detect the node pairs collaborating with each other. We used the BLEU
score to evaluate the model performance. Our results show that the predicting
performance of the AdLIoTLog model trained by our method degrades by 3-4% in
the presence of attack in comparison to the scenario when the network is not
under attack. AdLIoTLog can detect adversaries because when adversaries are
present the model gets duped by the collaborative events and therefore predicts
the next event with a biased event rather than a benign event. We conclude that
AI can provision ubiquitous learning for the new generation of Internet of
Things.

mechanics of point particles in an unbounded perfect gas is commonly accepted
as a foundation for understanding many systems, including liquids like the
concentrated salt solutions of life and electrochemical technology, from
batteries to nanodevices. Liquids, however, are not gases. Liquids are filled
with interacting molecules and so the model of a perfect gas is imperfect. Here
we show that statistical mechanics without bounds (in space) is impossible as
well as imperfect, if the molecules interact as charged particles, as nearly
all atoms do. The behavior of charged particles is not defined until boundary
structures and values are defined because charges are governed by the Maxwell
partial differential equations. Partial differential equations require boundary
conditions to be computable or well defined. The Maxwell equations require
boundary conditions on finite sized spatial boundaries (i.e., structures).
Boundary conditions cannot be defined 'at infinity' in a general (i.e., unique)
way because the limiting process that defines infinity includes such a wide
variety of behavior, from light waves that never decay, to fields from dipole
and multipolar charges that decay steeply, to Coulomb fields that decay but not
so steeply. Statistical mechanics involving charges thus involves spatial
boundaries and boundary conditions of finite size. Nearly all matter involves
charges, thus nearly all statistical mechanics requires structures and boundary
conditions on those structures. Boundaries and boundary conditions are not
prominent in classical statistical mechanics. Including boundaries is a
challenge to mathematicians. Statistical mechanics must describe bounded
systems if it is to provide a proper foundation for studying matter.

on organisms, develop foundational knowledge to support deep space exploration,
and ultimately bioengineer spacecraft and habitats to stabilize the ecosystem
of plants, crops, microbes, animals, and humans for sustained multi-planetary
life. To advance these aims, the field leverages experiments, platforms, data,
and model organisms from both spaceborne and ground-analog studies. As research
is extended beyond low Earth orbit, experiments and platforms must be maximally
autonomous, light, agile, and intelligent to expedite knowledge discovery. Here
we present a summary of recommendations from a workshop organized by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration on artificial intelligence,
machine learning, and modeling applications which offer key solutions toward
these space biology challenges. In the next decade, the synthesis of artificial
intelligence into the field of space biology will deepen the biological
understanding of spaceflight effects, facilitate predictive modeling and
analytics, support maximally autonomous and reproducible experiments, and
efficiently manage spaceborne data and metadata, all with the goal to enable
life to thrive in deep space.

exploration of radiotherapy treatment plans with a focus on overlap volumes

evaluation process. Quantitative properties can be interactively explored to
identify critical regions and used to steer the visualization for a detailed
inspection of candidates. We evaluated our approach with a user study covering
the individual visualizations and their interactions regarding helpfulness,
comprehensibility, intuitiveness, decision-making and speed. Results: A user
study with three domain experts was conducted using our software and evaluating
five data sets each representing a different type of cancer and location by
performing a set of tasks and filling out a questionnaire. The results show
that the visualizations and interactions help to identify and evaluate overlap
volumes according to their physical and dose properties. Furthermore, the task
of finding dose hot spots can also benefit from our approach. Conclusions: The
results indicate the potential to enhance the current treatment plan evaluation

concerning whether or not the cosmic expansion is even accelerating. An
unambiguous yes/no response to this query will significantly impact cosmology,
of course, but also the standard model of particle physics. Here, we discuss --
in a straightforward way -- how to understand the so-called `redshift drift'
sought by this campaign, and why its measurement will help us refine the
standard-model parameters if the answer is `yes.' A `no' answer, on the other
hand, could be more revolutionary, in the sense that it might provide a
resolution of several long-standing problems and inconsistencies in our current
cosmological models. An outcome of zero redshift drift, for example, would
obviate the need for a cosmological constant and render inflation completely

continuum hypothesis and the forcing axioms. Ever since G\""{o}del's and Cohen's
proofs that the ZFC cannot be used to disprove or approve continuum hypothesis,
i.e., that it is independent of the ZFC axioms there are efforts of adding at
least one new axiom to ZFC that should illuminate the structure of infinite
sets. The two main contenders for addition to ZFC are the inner-model axiom
'V-ultimate L' that builds a universe of sets from the ground up and Martin's
axiom that allows to expand it outward in all directions. If Martin's axiom is
correct, then the continuum hypothesis is false, and if the inner-model axiom
is right, then the continuum hypothesis is true. That model dependent view is
underlined with the L\""{o}wenheim-Skolem theorem, no theory can have only
nondenumerable models; if a theory has a nondenumerable model, it must have
denumerably infinite ones as well. Accepting axiomatization in whatever shape
means the notions 'denumerable' and 'nondenumerable' turn out to be relative
and it requires to accept the relativization of cardinals as it is first
pointed out by Skolem and Carnap. To show the impact of axiomatization
considered will be as an example a set created by a successive generation of
algebraic pairs, each filled with a single transcendental number, and examined
will be the impact of the axiom of choice on the determining the property of
such set. It will be shown that the given example supports the

theorem considered will be Wagner's $\Sigma$ model that generates a set in a
constructive way, different from ZF. For the first time, provided will be an

current decompilation tools usually need lots of experts' efforts, even for
years, to generate the rules for decompilation, which also requires long-term

ideal decompiler should concisely generate high-level PL with similar
functionality to the source low-level PL and semantic information (e.g.,
meaningful variable names), just like human-written code. Unfortunately,
existing manually-defined rule-based decompilation techniques only functionally
restore the low-level PL to a similar high-level PL and are still powerless to

  Uncertainty:a literature review",,,,,"physics.soc-ph math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supply chain network is critical to serving customers, so the most common
practices are to determine the number, location, and capacity of facilities.
But at the same time, uncertainties and risks must be taken into account in
order to control delays. In this context, many optimisation models have been
developed to use the results in transportation network and therefore improve
the supply chain performance. Models were developed in both routing and
zoning/districting problems, and different cases have been discussed in the
literature, such as facility location problems, urban problems, and
transportation problems. This paper seeks to review the literature in this area
and decompose the models into Mathematical modelling and Geometrical
approaches. Distribution is an important part of the supply chain management,
it is a process with multiple participants. This characteristic brings a high
level of uncertainty. This article therefore presents the distribution process
and in particular the design of the transportation network which can include
both routing and districting problems.

showing its emergence from a familiar geometric setting makes it a more natural
phenomenon. In this work, we present a new theorem connecting the Tangent
Secant theorem to the golden ratio. Such a connection enhances the learning
process of the theorem, and it demystifies the golden ratio in physics and
other disciplines.

space-time event. This is different from earlier relativistic paradoxes
involving extended bodies or events at different positions. A collision between
a rod and a ring impacting at an oblique angle to each other is considered in
the context of the special theory relativity. A question arises as to where
along the length of the rod the point of impact will be according to two
observers following the rod and the ring, respectively. The observers argue
from a purely kinematical point of view in favor of two different points of
impact along the rod. However there can only exist one point of impact. In
order to solve this apparent paradox we use the asynchronous formulation of
relativistic kinematics in which the consequences of the relativity of
simultaneity are built into the formalism. We show that this reconciles the
descriptions from the two frames of reference, and hence that the new paradox
leads to a strong argument for the relevance of the asynchronous formulation of
relativistic kinematics.

classes with set representation characterisations. The complexity of
recognising SOGs in open. The complexities of recognising many subclasses of
SOGs are known. We consider several subclasses of SOGs by restricting the
underlying tree. For a fixed integer $k \geq 3$, we consider:
\begin{my_itemize}
  \item The overlap graphs of subtrees in a tree where that tree has $k$ leaves
  \item The overlap graphs of subtrees in trees that can be derived from a
given input tree by subdivision and have at least 3 leaves
  \item The overlap and intersection graphs of paths in a tree where that tree
has maximum degree $k$ \end{my_itemize}
  We show that the recognition problems of these classes are NP-complete. For
all other parameters we get circle graphs, well known to be polynomially
recognizable.

When one actually wants to make such an optical device, one can predict its
optical behavior using computational simulations of Maxwell's equations. If one
then asks what the optimal design would be in order to obtain a certain optical
behavior, the only way to go further would be to try out all of the possible
designs and compute the electromagnetic spectrum they produce. When there are
many design parameters, this brute force approach quickly becomes too
computationally expensive. We therefore need other methods to create optimal
optical devices. An alternative to the brute force approach is inverse design.
In this paradigm, one starts from the desired optical response of a material
and then determines the design parameters that are needed to obtain this
optical response. There are many algorithms known in the literature that
implement this inverse design. Some of the best performing, recent approaches
are based on Deep Learning. The central idea is to train a neural network to
predict the optical response for given design parameters. Since neural networks
are completely differentiable, we can compute gradients of the response with
respect to the design parameters. We can use these gradients to update the
design parameters and get an optical response closer to the one we want. This
allows us to obtain an optimal design much faster compared to the brute force
approach. In my thesis, I use Deep Learning for the inverse design of the
Fabry-P\'erot resonator. This system can be described fully analytically and is
therefore ideal to study.
