shortcoming(s) of an existing formulation encouraged the development of an
alternative formulation. Whenever possible, a 2-dimensional phase portrait is

applications, algorithms using communication compression have attracted
significant attention and are widely used in practice. Moreover, the huge
number, high heterogeneity and limited availability of clients result in high
client-variance. This paper addresses these two issues together by proposing
compressed and client-variance reduced methods COFIG and FRECON. We prove an
$O(\frac{(1+\omega)^{3/2}\sqrt{N}}{S\epsilon^2}+\frac{(1+\omega)N^{2/3}}{S\epsilon^2})$
bound on the number of communication rounds of COFIG in the nonconvex setting,
where $N$ is the total number of clients, $S$ is the number of clients
participating in each round, $\epsilon$ is the convergence error, and $\omega$
is the variance parameter associated with the compression operator. In case of
FRECON, we prove an $O(\frac{(1+\omega)\sqrt{N}}{S\epsilon^2})$ bound on the
number of communication rounds. In the convex setting, COFIG converges within
$O(\frac{(1+\omega)\sqrt{N}}{S\epsilon})$ communication rounds, which is also
the first convergence result for compression schemes that do not communicate
with all the clients in each round. We stress that neither COFIG nor FRECON
needs to communicate with all the clients, and they enjoy the first or faster
convergence results for convex and nonconvex federated learning in the regimes
considered. Experimental results point to an empirical superiority of COFIG and
FRECON over existing baselines.

In nanowires on Si(111) surface, spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking leads to
symmetrically distinct four degenerate quasi-1D CDW structures, which exhibit
geometrical chirality. Such geometrical chirality may naturally induce
optically active phenomena even when the quasi-1D CDW structures are stacked
perpendicular to the CDW chain direction. Indeed, we find that left- and
right-chiral stacking orders show distinct circular dichroism responses while a
nonchiral stacking order does no circular dichroism. Such optical responses are
attributed to the existence of glide mirror symmetry of the CDW stacking
orders. Our findings suggest that the CDW chiral stacking orders can lead to
diverse active optical phenomena such as chirality-dependent circular
dichroism, which can be observed in scanning tunneling luminescence
measurements with circularly polarized light.

mass (for phases and vapor component), momentum, and energy. In addition, the
evolution of the phase field is described by the Allen-Cahn equation. In the
limit of vanishing interface width, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that
the phase-field model reduces to the sharp-interface model with all the
relevant transmission conditions at the moving interface. An energy estimate is
derived, which suggests that for the diffusion-dominated regime, energy always
decreases with time. However, this is not always the case for other regimes.
The phase-field model is upscaled to the Darcy scale using periodic
homogenization for the diffusion-dominated regime. The effective parameters at
the Darcy scale are connected to the pore scale through corresponding cell
problems.

the utility of our learned priors on noisy MRI data (no prior domain shift),

Using fluctuating hydrodynamics for a binary fluid mixture at low Mach numbers,
we justify linearization around the deterministic Navier-Stokes solution in the
dissipation range. For the latter solution we adopt the standard Kraichnan
model and derive asymptotic high-Schmidt limiting equations for the
concentration field, in which the thermal velocity fluctuations are exactly
represented by a Gaussian random velocity which is white in time. We obtain the
exact solution for the concentration spectrum in this high-Schmidt limiting
model, showing that the Batchelor prediction in the viscous-convective range is
unaltered. Thermal noise dramatically renormalizes the bare diffusivity in this
range, but the effect is the same as in laminar flow and thus hidden
phenomenologically. However, in the viscous-diffusive range at scales below the
Batchelor length (typically micron scales) the predictions based on
deterministic Navier-Stokes equations are drastically altered by thermal noise.
Whereas the classical theories predict rapidly decaying spectra in the
viscous-diffusive range, we obtain a $k^{-2}$ power-law spectrum starting just
below the Batchelor length. This spectrum corresponds to non-equilibrium giant
concentration fluctuations, due to the imposed concentration variations
advected by thermal velocity fluctuations which are experimentally
well-observed in quiescent fluids. At higher wavenumbers, the concentration
spectrum instead goes to a $k^2$ equipartition spectrum due to equilibrium
molecular fluctuations. We work out detailed predictions for water-glycerol and
water-fluorescein mixtures. Finally, we discuss broad implications for
turbulent flows and novel applications of our methods to experimentally
accessible laminar flows.

the warped Cardy formula relies on the zero mode spectrum being bounded from
below. Generically, this is not true for holographic WCFTs in ""canonical""
ensemble, whereas this condition is satisfied in the ""quadratic"" ensemble,
making it more natural in holographic setups. In this work, we find a new set
of boundary conditions in three-dimensional Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG)
such that the putative dual theory is a WCFT in quadratic ensemble.
Surprisingly, imposing the equations of motion, we obtain a closed form metric
spanned by two arbitrary chiral functions, analogous to the Ba\~nados metrics
in Einstein gravity. Surface charges for these boundary conditions are not a
priori integrable and we discuss two choices of boundary conditions to make
them so. We obtain the bulk thermodynamic entropy of warped BTZ black holes by
making use of the warped Cardy formula, in its regime of validity. We also
discuss the issue of identifying the vacuum in our solution space: demanding
the enhancement of global symmetries selects only a family of solutions, out of
which the unique vacuum must be carefully singled out.

the diversity coefficient -- to measure the diversity of tasks in a few-shot

and vanishing longitudinal resistances at zero magnetic field that are
protected against local perturbations and independent of sample details. This
insensitivity makes the microscopic details of the local current distribution
inaccessible to global transport measurements. Accordingly, the current
distributions that give rise to the transport quantization are unknown. Here we
use magnetic imaging to directly visualize the transport current in the QAH
regime. As we tune through the QAH plateau by electrostatic gating, we clearly
identify a regime in which the sample transports current primarily in the bulk
rather than along the edges. Furthermore, we image the local response of the
magnetization to electrostatic gating. Combined, these measurements suggest
that incompressible regions carry the current within the QAH regime. Our
observations indicate that the self-consistent electrostatics of the sample
play a central role in determining the current distribution. Identifying the
appropriate microscopic picture of electronic transport in QAH insulators and
other topologically non-trivial states of matter is a crucial step towards
realizing their potential in next-generation quantum devices.

properties. From a comparative study of the band structures of C3N3, C3N4, and
C3N5, we found that, the electronic band-gap decreases as 3.24 eV (C3N3) > 2.81
eV (C3N4) > 2.19 eV (C3N5) with increase in the number of nitrogen atoms in the
unit cell of these graphitic carbon nitrides. Further, the strain dependency of
the band structure of 2D g-C3N5 under uniaxial and biaxial strain is performed
using the same HSE- 06 functional. We found a systematic decrease of band-gap
as strain increases. Out of the two types of strain, the biaxial strain has
been found to be more efficient in modulating the band-gap. The effect of
strain on the structure is also explored by analyzing the bond lengths and
bond-angles as well as the charge density plots. Furthermore, we found that at
a biaxial strain of 20% strain an interesting structural rearrangement occurs
in 2D g-C3N5, which reults in a finite magnetic moment arising from the loss of
spin-degeneracy of electronic levels. Finally, by studying the evolution of
band-gap, band-alignments and optical absorption as a function of strain we are
able to predict that biaxially compressed C3N5 with strain in the range 12-14%

societal challenge, and developing a sustainable energy portfolio is an
especially daunting task for developing countries where little to no
information is available regarding the abundance of renewable resources such as
wind. Weather model simulations are key to obtain such information when
observational data are scarce and sparse over a country as large and
geographically diverse as Saudi Arabia. However, output from such models is
uncertain, as it depends on inputs such as the parametrization of the physical
processes and the spatial resolution of the simulated domain. In such
situations, a sensitivity analysis must be performed and the input may have a
spatially heterogeneous influence of wind. In this work, we propose a latent
Gaussian functional analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that relies on a
nonstationary Gaussian Markov random field approximation of a continuous latent
process. The proposed approach is able to capture the local sensitivity of
Gaussian and non-Gaussian wind characteristics such as speed and threshold
exceedances over a large simulation domain, and a continuous underlying process
also allows us to assess the effect of different spatial resolutions. Our
results indicate that (1) the non-local planetary boundary layer scheme and
high spatial resolution are both instrumental in capturing wind speed and
energy (especially over complex mountainous terrain), and (2) the impact of
planetary boundary layer scheme and resolution on Saudi Arabia's planned wind
farms is small (at most 1.4%). Thus, our results lend support for the
construction of these wind farms in the next decade.

A Data Centric Perspective","15 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work has suggested that a good embedding is all we need to solve many
few-shot learning benchmarks. Furthermore, other work has strongly suggested
that Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) also works via this same method - by
learning a good embedding. These observations highlight our lack of
understanding of what meta-learning algorithms are doing and when they work. In
this work, we provide empirical results that shed some light on how
meta-learned MAML representations function. In particular, we identify three
interesting properties: 1) In contrast to previous work, we show that it is
possible to define a family of synthetic benchmarks that result in a low degree
of feature re-use - suggesting that current few-shot learning benchmarks might
not have the properties needed for the success of meta-learning algorithms; 2)
meta-overfitting occurs when the number of classes (or concepts) are finite,
and this issue disappears once the task has an unbounded number of concepts
(e.g., online learning); 3) more adaptation at meta-test time with MAML does
not necessarily result in a significant representation change or even an
improvement in meta-test performance - even when training on our proposed
synthetic benchmarks. Finally, we suggest that to understand meta-learning
algorithms better, we must go beyond tracking only absolute performance and, in
addition, formally quantify the degree of meta-learning and track both metrics
together. Reporting results in future work this way will help us identify the
sources of meta-overfitting more accurately and help us design more flexible
meta-learning algorithms that learn beyond fixed feature re-use. Finally, we
conjecture the core challenge of re-thinking meta-learning is in the design of
few-shot learning data sets and benchmarks - rather than in the algorithms, as
suggested by previous work.

realizations in two-stage robust optimization problems with categorical or
binary-valued uncertain data. Traditional exact algorithms for these problems,
notably Benders decomposition and column-and-constraint generation, compute
worst-case parameter realizations by solving mixed-integer bilinear
optimization subproblems. However, their numerical solution can be
computationally expensive not only due to their resulting large size after
reformulating the bilinear terms, but also because decision-independent bounds
on their variables are typically unknown. We propose an alternative Lagrangian
dual method that circumvents these difficulties and is readily integrated in
either algorithm. We specialize the method to problems where the binary
parameters switch on or off constraints as these are commonly encountered in
applications, and discuss extensions to problems that lack relatively complete
recourse and to those with integer recourse. Numerical experiments provide
evidence of significant computational improvements over existing methods.

distances (GED and SED respectively) are two of the most popular and expressive
measures. Unfortunately, exact computations for both are NP-hard. To overcome
this computational bottleneck, neural approaches to learn and predict edit
distance in polynomial time have received much interest. While considerable
progress has been made, there exist limitations that need to be addressed.
First, the efficacy of an approximate distance function lies not only in its
approximation accuracy, but also in the preservation of its properties. To
elaborate, although GED is a metric, its neural approximations do not provide
such a guarantee. This prohibits their usage in higher order tasks that rely on
metric distance functions, such as clustering or indexing. Second, several
existing frameworks for GED do not extend to SED due to SED being asymmetric.
In this work, we design a novel siamese graph neural network called GREED,
which through a carefully crafted inductive bias, learns GED and SED in a
property-preserving manner. Through extensive experiments across 10 real graph
datasets containing up to 7 million edges, we establish that GREED is not only
more accurate than the state of the art, but also up to 3 orders of magnitude
faster. Even more significantly, due to preserving the triangle inequality, the
generated embeddings are indexable and consequently, even in a CPU-only
environment, GREED is up to 50 times faster than GPU-powered baselines for

violation of the Gell-Mann--Okubo mass relation, modified form factors, altered

that in the presence of a low lying state, such as an ALP, extraction of

meson-physics observables is a highly non-trivial exercise. However, once done
correctly, these same observables may, in turn, provide important (indirect)

about their effects on anomalous transport. Here we demonstrate how these
dissipative processes are strongly intertwined with Berry-curvature physics.
Our calculations are made possible by the introduction of a Caldeira-Leggett
reservoir which allows us to avoid the sometimes-problematic device of the
pseudogravitational potential. Using our formulas, we focus on the
finite-temperature behavior of the important anomalous Wiedemann-Franz ratio.
Despite previous expectations, this ratio is found to be non-universal as it
can exhibit either an upturn or a downturn as temperature increases away from
zero. We emphasize that this derives from a \textit{competition} between Berry
curvatures having different signs in different regions of the Brillouin zone.
We point to experimental support for these observations and for the behavior of
an alternative ratio involving a thermoelectric response which, by contrast,
appears to be more universal at low temperatures. Our work paves the way for
future theory and experiment, demonstrating how inelastic scattering at
non-zero temperature affects the behavior of all anomalous transport

($N$ prime), the proposed approach can compute up to $N^{2}$ additions per
clock cycle. Compared to previous approaches, the scalable approach provides
the fastest known implementations for different amounts of computational
resources. For example, for a $251\times 251$ image, for approximately $25\%$
fewer flip-flops than required for a systolic implementation, we have that the

used to represent each input pixel. On the other hand, the scalable DPRT
approach requires more 1-bit additions than for the systolic implementation and
provides a trade-off between speed and additional 1-bit additions. All of the
proposed DPRT architectures were implemented in VHDL and validated using an

accomplished through the use of the Discrete Periodic Radon Transform (DPRT)
for general kernels and the use of SVD-LU decompositions for low-rank kernels.
The approach uses scalable architectures that can be fitted into modern FPGA

$P\times P$ blocks, 2D convolutions and cross-correlations can be computed in
just $O(P)$ clock cycles up to $O(P^2)$ clock cycles. Thus, there is a

SmFe$_{12}X$, the doped light elements $X$ are assumed to be at the $2b$ site,
and in SmFe$_{11}M$, the substitution site of Fe is systematically investigated
for all inequivalent $8f$, $8i$, and $8j$ sites. We found that the first-order
MA constant $K_1$ is increased by a factor of about two when hydrogen is doped
to the $2b$ site and when Fe is replaced by Ti or V at the $8j$ site, owing to
the attraction of the prolate $4f$ electron cloud to the screened positive
charges of the surrounding ligand ions. We found that when Fe is replaced by
Co, the MA increases at all temperatures regardless of the substitution site.
The substituted Co attracts electrons, which reduces the electron density in
the region from the Sm site to the empty $2b$ site. This causes the $4f$
electron cloud at the Sm site to be fixed along the $c$-axis direction, which
improves the MA. The calculated temperature dependence of $K_1(T)$ and $K_2(T)$
in SmFe$_{11}$Co qualitatively reproduces the experimental results in the case

suffers from the degradation of speech audibility. Bone conduction microphones
(BCM) are robust against ambient noises but suffer from limited effective
bandwidth due to their sensing mechanism. Although existing audio super
resolution algorithms can recover the high frequency loss to achieve
high-fidelity audio, they require considerably more computational resources
than available in low-power hearable devices. This paper proposes the
first-ever real-time on-chip speech audio super resolution system for BCM. To
accomplish this, we built and compared a series of lightweight audio super
resolution deep learning models. Among all these models, ATS-UNet is the most
cost-efficient because the proposed novel Audio Temporal Shift Module (ATSM)
reduces the network's dimensionality while maintaining sufficient temporal
features from speech audios. Then we quantized and deployed the ATS-UNet to
low-end ARM micro-controller units for real-time embedded prototypes.
Evaluation results show that our system achieved real-time inference speed on
Cortex-M7 and higher quality than the baseline audio super resolution method.
Finally, we conducted a user study with ten experts and ten amateur listeners
to evaluate our method's effectiveness to human ears. Both groups perceived a
significantly higher speech quality with our method when compared to the
solutions with the original BCM or air conduction microphone with cutting-edge

environment and their host galaxies. They lose mass from their birth through
strong stellar winds up to their spectacular end of their lives as supernovae.
The mass loss changes as they evolve and in some phases it becomes episodic or
displays outburst activity. One such phase is the Yellow Hypergiants, in which
they experience outbursts due to their pulsations and atmosphere instabilities.
This is depicted in photometry as a decrease in their apparent magnitude. The
object $\rho$ Cassiopeia (Cas) is a bright and well known variable star that
has experienced four major outbursts over the last century, with the most
recent one detected in 2013. We derived the light curves from both visual and
digital observations and we show that with some processing and a small
correction ($\sim0.2$ mag) for the visual the two curves match. This highlights
the importance of visual observations both because of the accuracy we can
obtain and because they fully cover the historic activity (only the last two of
the four outbursts are well covered by digital observations) with a homogeneous
approach. By fitting the outburst profiles from visual observations we derive
the duration of each outburst. We notice a decreasing trend in the duration, as
well as shorter intervals between the outbursts. This activity indicates that
$\rho$ Cas may be preparing to pass to the next evolutionary phase.

the harmonic measurement technique has never been verified in antiferromagnetic

has a positive eigenvalue $\lambda^2<m^2$ with associated eigenfunction $\phi.$
This is a so-called internal mode and gives rise to time-periodic and spatially
localized solutions of the linear flow. We address the classical question of
whether such solutions persist under the full nonlinear flow, and describe the
behavior of all solutions in a suitable neighborhood of zero. Provided a
natural Fermi-Golden rule holds, our main result shows that a solution to the
nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation can be decomposed into a discrete component
$a(t)\phi$ where $a(t)$ decays over time, and a continuous component $v$ which

the model is trained to learn that ""this image is totally not any random class

introduces a semantic prior based random search for the opposite labels to

making them localized, CGCN provides a fast and efficient convolution operation
to model the graph structural smart grid data. We numerically verify that the

  We first investigate the representation theory of

$\mathfrak{sl}_3$ at fourth root of unity. In particular, we analyse its
finite-dimensional weight category, determining Loewy diagrams for all
projective indecomposables and decomposing all tensor products of irreducibles.
Our motivation is that this category is conjecturally braided tensor equivalent
to a category of $W_{A_2}^0(2)$-modules. Here, $W_{A_2}^0(2)$ is an orbifold of
the octuplet vertex algebra $W_{A_2}(2)$ of Semikhatov, the latter being the
natural $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-analogue of the well known triplet algebra. Moreover,
$W_{A_2}^0(2)$ is the parafermionic coset of the affine vertex algebra

information connecting the atomistic molecular structure and proteins'
biologically relevant motion, where large-scale fluctuations are deemed to
guide folding and function. In the complex multiscale processes described by MD
trajectories it is difficult to identify, separate, and study those large-scale
fluctuations. This problem can be formulated as the need to identify a small
number of collective variables that guide the slow kinetic processes. Among the
methods used to study the slow, leading processes in proteins' dynamics, the
time-lagged independent component analysis, or tICA, has been extensively used.
Recently, we developed a Langevin coarse-grained approach for the dynamics of
proteins, called the Langevin Equation for Protein Dynamics or LE4PD. This
approach partitions the protein's MD dynamics into uncorrelated,
wavelength-dependent, diffusive modes, and it associates to each mode a
free-energy map. In the free energy maps, we measure the spatial extension and
the time evolution of the mode-dependent, slow dynamical fluctuations, using
the string method and a Markov state model. The theory identifies the slow
collective variables in the rescaled LE4PD normal modes. Here, we compare the
tICA modes' predictions with the collective LE4PD modes. We observe that the
two methods consistently identify the nature and extension of the slowest
fluctuation processes. The tICA separates the slow, leading processes in a
smaller number of modes than the LE4PD does. However, LE4PD provides
time-dependent information and a formal connection to the physics of the
kinetic processes missing in the pure statistical analysis of tICA.

the G-type spin phase, and $J_{ab}$ = -3.8 meV, $J_{c}$ = 7.6 meV at 80 K and
$J_{ab}$ = -3.0 meV, $J_{c}$ = 6.0 meV at 100 K in the C-type spin phase.
Paramagnetic scattering was observed in the spin ordered phases, well below the
C-type transition temperature, that continuously increased above the
transition. Fluctuations in the temperature dependence of the phonon density of
states were observed between 50 and 80 K as well, coinciding with the G-type to
C-type transition. These fluctuations are attributed to optical oxygen modes
above 40 meV, from first principles calculations. In contrast, little change in
the phonon spectra is observed across $T_{N}$.

short periods of time in tree indexes. Waves of misery negatively affect the
performance of tree indexes in insertion-heavy workloads.Waves of misery have
been first observed in the context of the B-tree, where these waves cause
unpredictable index performance. In particular, the performance of search and
index-update operations deteriorate when a wave of misery takes place, but is
more predictable between the waves. This paper investigates the presence or
lack of waves of misery in several R-tree variants, and studies the extent of
which these waves impact the performance of each variant. Interestingly,
although having poorer query performance, the Linear and Quadratic R-trees are
found to be more resilient to waves of misery than both the Hilbert and
R*-trees. This paper presents several techniques to reduce the impact in
performance of the waves of misery for the Hilbert and R*-trees. One way to
eliminate waves of misery is to force node splits to take place at regular
times before nodes become full to achieve deterministic performance. The other
way is that upon splitting a node, do not split it evenly but rather at
different node utilization factors. This allows leaf nodes not to fill at the
same pace. We study the impact of two new techniques to mitigate waves of
misery after the tree index has been constructed, namely Regular Elective
Splits (RES, for short) and Unequal Random Splits (URS, for short). Our
experimental investigation highlights the trade-offs in performance of the
introduced techniques and the pros and cons of each technique.

networks. We study the shortest path edge interdiction problem for defending
Active Directory style attack graphs. The problem is formulated as a
Stackelberg game between one defender and one attacker. The attack graph
contains one destination node and multiple entry nodes. The attacker's entry
node is chosen by nature. The defender chooses to block a set of edges limited
by his budget. The attacker then picks the shortest unblocked attack path. The
defender aims to maximize the expected shortest path length for the attacker,
where the expectation is taken over entry nodes.
  We observe that practical Active Directory attack graphs have small maximum
attack path lengths and are structurally close to trees. We first show that
even if the maximum attack path length is a constant, the problem is still
$W[1]$-hard with respect to the defender's budget. Having a small maximum
attack path length and a small budget is not enough to design fixed-parameter
algorithms. If we further assume that the number of entry nodes is small, then
we derive a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm.
  We then propose two other fixed-parameter algorithms by exploiting the
tree-like features. One is based on tree decomposition and requires a small
tree width. The other assumes a small number of splitting nodes (nodes with
multiple out-going edges). Finally, the last algorithm is converted into a
graph convolutional neural network based heuristic, which scales to larger
graphs with more splitting nodes.

(MTL). MTL is to determine the locations of potential multiple transmitters in
a field, based on readings from a distributed set of sensors. In contrast to
the widely studied single transmitter localization problem, the MTL problem has
only been studied recently in a few works. MTL is of great significance in many
applications wherein intruders may be present. E.g., in shared spectrum
systems, detection of unauthorized transmitters and estimating their power are
imperative to efficient utilization of the shared spectrum.
  In this paper, we present DeepMTL, a novel deep-learning approach to address
the MTL problem. In particular, we frame MTL as a sequence of two steps, each
of which is a computer vision problem: image-to-image translation and object
detection. The first step of mage-to-image translation essentially maps an
input image representing sensor readings to an image representing the
distribution of transmitter locations, and the second object detection step
derives precise locations of transmitters from the image of transmitter
distributions. For the first step, we design our learning model Sen2Peak, while
for the second step, we customize a state-of-the-art object detection model
YOLO-cust. Using DeepMTL as a building block, we also develop techniques to
estimate transmit power of the localized transmitters. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach via extensive large-scale simulations and show
that our approach outperforms the previous approaches significantly (by 50% or
more) in performance metrics including localization error, miss rate, and false
alarm rate. Our method also incurs a very small latency. We evaluate our
techniques over a small-scale area with real testbed data and the testbed
results align with the simulation results.

neither explain how to extend this definition to whole Euclidean space

  In this paper, we regard the cyclic lattices and ideal lattices as the
correspondences of finitely generated $R$-modules, so that we may show that
ideal lattices are actually a special subclass of cyclic lattices, namely,
cyclic integer lattices. In fact, there is a one to one correspondence between
cyclic lattices in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and finitely generated $R$-modules (see

reasonable to regard ideal lattices as a special subclass of cyclic lattices
(see corollary \ref{co3.4} below). It is worth noting that we use more general
rotation matrix here, so our definition and results on cyclic lattices and
ideal lattices are more general forms. As application, we provide cyclic
lattice with an explicit and countable upper bound for the smoothing parameter

and a highly cost-effective single modality treatment of cancer care. Typical
regimens for fractionated external beam radiotherapy comprise a constant dose
administered on weekdays, and no radiation on weekends. However, every patient
has a tumor with distinct properties depending on intra-tumor heterogeneity,
aggressiveness, and interactive properties with other cells that may make it
more resistant or sensitive to radiation treatment. Accordingly, the concept of
personalized cancer treatment is emerging to specialize each patient treatment
case to the unique properties of the tumor. In this paper, we examine adaptive
radiation treatment strategies for heterogeneous tumors using a dynamical
system model that consists of radiation-resistant and parental cell populations
with unique interactive properties. We study different adaptive dosage
strategies for PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. We show that stronger
doses of radiation given in longer time intervals, while keeping the overall
dosage the same, reduce final tumor volume by more than half in PC3 cell lines,
but by only five percent in DU145 cell lines. In addition, we tested an
adaptive dosing schedule by administering a stronger dosage on Friday to
compensate for the treatment-off period during the weekend, which was effective
in decreasing the final tumor volume of both cell lines. This result creates
interesting possibilities for new radiotherapy strategies at clinics that
cannot provide treatment on weekends. Finally, we propose a dosage plan

control methods were discussed in detail: On-off and finite-state,
proportional, direct, and posture, simultaneous, classification and
regression-based control, and deep learning methods. Myoelectric control
performance indices, such as completion time and rate, throughput, lag, and
path length, were reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of the control
methods were also discussed. Some of myoelectric prosthesis control's
significant challenges are comfort, durability, cost, the application of
under-sampled signals, and electrode shift. Moreover, the proposed algorithms
must be usually tuned after each don and doff, which is not comfortable for the
users. Real-time simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control, resampling
human's arm, has brought much attention. However, increasing the degree of
freedom reduces the overall performance. Applying a 3D printed prosthesis arm
and under-sampled electromyographic signals could reduce the fabrication cost
and improve the application of such methods in practice. There are many
technological and clinical challenges in this area to reduce the prosthesis

previous actions in the current session. The major challenge is to capture
authentic and complete user preferences in the entire session. Recent work
utilizes graph structure to represent the entire session and adopts Graph
Neural Network to encode session information. This modeling choice has been
proved to be effective and achieved remarkable results. However, most of the
existing studies only consider each item within the session independently and
do not capture session semantics from a high-level perspective. Such limitation
often leads to severe information loss and increases the difficulty of
capturing long-range dependencies within a session. Intuitively, compared with
individual items, a session snippet, i.e., a group of locally consecutive
items, is able to provide supplemental user intents which are hardly captured
by existing methods. In this work, we propose to learn multi-granularity
consecutive user intent unit to improve the recommendation performance.
Specifically, we creatively propose Multi-granularity Intent Heterogeneous
Session Graph which captures the interactions between different granularity
intent units and relieves the burden of long-dependency. Moreover, we propose
the Intent Fusion Ranking module to compose the recommendation results from
various granularity user intents. Compared with current methods that only
leverage intents from individual items, IFR benefits from different granularity
user intents to generate more accurate and comprehensive session

extensive experiments on five session-based recommendation datasets and the
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

turbulent kinetic energy (hereafter SGS energy) in turbulent channel flows

the convenience of the SMM by replacing the modeled transport equation for the
SGS energy with an algebraic model. The SMM quantitatively adequately predicts
the total turbulent kinetic energy of the direct numerical simulation (DNS)
even in coarse grid cases. For both the filtered DNS (fDNS) and large-eddy
simulation (LES), the statistically averaged production term balances with the
dissipation in the region away from the wall in the SGS energy transport
equation. In contrast, we reveal that the correlation coefficient between the
production and dissipation terms is high for the modeled transport equation in
LES, whereas that for the fDNS is low. Based on the high correlation or local
equilibrium between the production and dissipation observed in the LES, we
demonstrate the reduction of the SMM into a zero-equation SMM (ZE-SMM). We
construct a new damping function based on the grid-scale Kolmogorov length to
reproduce the near-wall behavior of the algebraic model for the SGS energy. The
ZE-SMM provides quantitatively the same performance as the original SMM that
employs the SGS energy transport model. This result suggests that the local
equilibrium model for the SGS energy provides the equivalent performance as the
transport model in wall-bounded turbulent flows even in coarse grid cases.

computer science, and engineering. This work introduces a geometric algebra
method for the molecular surface generation that utilizes the Clifford-Fourier
transform which is a generalization of the classical Fourier transform.
Notably, the classical Fourier transform and Clifford-Fourier transform differ
in the derivative property in $R_k$ for k even. This distinction is due to the
noncommutativity of geometric product of pseudoscalars with multivectors and
has significant consequences in applications. We use the Clifford-Fourier
transform in $R_3$ to benefit from the derivative property in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs). The Clifford-Fourier transform is used to solve
the mode decomposition process in PDE transform. Two different initial cases
are proposed to make the initial shapes used in the present method. The
proposed method is applied first to small molecules and proteins. To validate
the method, the molecular surfaces generated are compared to surfaces of other
definitions. Applications are considered to protein electrostatic analysis.

individual's health information (e.g. their drug history and comorbidities) as
inputs, and predict the probability that the individual will have an Acute
Coronary Syndrome (ACS) adverse outcome. Using XAI, we quantified the
contribution that specific drugs had on these ACS predictions, thus creating an
XAI-based technique for pharmacovigilance monitoring, using ACS as an example
of the adverse outcome to detect. Individuals aged over 65 who were supplied
Musculo-skeletal system (anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) class M) or
Cardiovascular system (ATC class C) drugs between 1993 and 2009 were
identified, and their drug histories, comorbidities, and other key features
were extracted from linked Western Australian datasets. Multiple ML models were
trained to predict if these individuals would have an ACS related adverse
outcome (i.e., death or hospitalisation with a discharge diagnosis of ACS), and
a variety of ML and XAI techniques were used to calculate which features --
specifically which drugs -- led to these predictions. The drug dispensing
features for rofecoxib and celecoxib were found to have a greater than zero
contribution to ACS related adverse outcome predictions (on average), and it
was found that ACS related adverse outcomes can be predicted with 72% accuracy.
Furthermore, the XAI libraries LIME and SHAP were found to successfully
identify both important and unimportant features, with SHAP slightly
outperforming LIME. ML models trained on linked administrative health datasets
in tandem with XAI algorithms can successfully quantify feature importance, and

  Topological Invariants","Misprints and typos are corrected",,,,"math.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we explore the existence of pluricomplex Green functions for
Stein manifolds from a functional analysis point of view. For a Stein manifold
$M$, we will denote by $O(M)$ the Fr\'echet space of analytic functions on $M$
equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets. In the
first section, we examine the relationship between the existence of
pluricomplex Green functions and the diametral dimension of $O(M)$. This led us
to consider negative plurisubharmonic functions on $M$ with a nontrivial
relatively compact sublevel set (semi-proper). In section 2, we characterize
Stein manifolds possessing a semi-proper negative plurisubharmonic function
through a local version of the linear topological invariant $\widetilde{\Omega
}$, of D.Vogt. In section 3 we look into pluri-Greenian complex manifolds
introduced by E.Poletsky. We show that a complex manifold is locally uniformly
pluri-Greenian if and only if it is pluri-Greenian and give a characterization
of locally uniformly uniformly pluri-Greenian Stein manifolds in terms of
notions introduced in section 2.

approach for combining OFIs at the top levels of the limit order book into an
integrated OFI variable which better explains price-impact, compared to the
best-level OFI. Equipped with this, we show that in the contemporaneous
cross-impact setting, once the information from multiple levels is integrated
into the OFI, multi-asset models with cross-impact do not provide additional
explanatory power for contemporaneous impact compared to a sparse model without
the cross-impact terms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the opposite effect in the
forward-looking cross-impact setting, namely, cross-asset OFIs do improve the
forecast of future returns, both in terms of $R^2$ and economic incentives,
thus providing evidence of cross-impact. We also establish that this
cross-impact mainly manifests at short-term horizons and decays rapidly in
time.

  Neuron Identification",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their outperformance in various
domains. However, it raises a social concern whether DNNs can produce reliable
and fair decisions especially when they are applied to sensitive domains
involving valuable resource allocation, such as education, loan, and
employment. It is crucial to conduct fairness testing before DNNs are reliably
deployed to such sensitive domains, i.e., generating as many instances as
possible to uncover fairness violations. However, the existing testing methods
are still limited from three aspects: interpretability, performance, and
generalizability. To overcome the challenges, we propose NeuronFair, a new DNN
fairness testing framework that differs from previous work in several key
aspects: (1) interpretable - it quantitatively interprets DNNs' fairness
violations for the biased decision; (2) effective - it uses the interpretation
results to guide the generation of more diverse instances in less time; (3)
generic - it can handle both structured and unstructured data. Extensive
evaluations across 7 datasets and the corresponding DNNs demonstrate
NeuronFair's superior performance. For instance, on structured datasets, it
generates much more instances (~x5.84) and saves more time (with an average
speedup of 534.56%) compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the
instances of NeuronFair can also be leveraged to improve the fairness of the
biased DNNs, which helps build more fair and trustworthy deep learning systems.

statement's underlying accounting journal entries. Driven by advances in
artificial intelligence, deep-learning inspired audit techniques emerged to
examine vast quantities of journal entry data. However, in regular audits, most
of the proposed methods are applied to learn from a comparably stationary
journal entry population, e.g., of a financial quarter or year. Ignoring
situations where audit relevant distribution changes are not evident in the
training data or become incrementally available over time. In contrast, in
continuous auditing, deep-learning models are continually trained on a stream
of recorded journal entries, e.g., of the last hour. Resulting in situations
where previous knowledge interferes with new information and will be entirely
overwritten. This work proposes a continual anomaly detection framework to
overcome both challenges and designed to learn from a stream of journal entry
data experiences. The framework is evaluated based on deliberately designed
audit scenarios and two real-world datasets. Our experimental results provide
initial evidence that such a learning scheme offers the ability to reduce
false-positive alerts and false-negative decisions.

approach) by quantum gravity corrections to a pure classical background. In the
framework of the Kucha\v{r} and Torre proposal for a gravity-matter theory
constrained to a Gaussian reference frame, materialized as a fluid in the
system evolution, we consider a Born-Oppenheimer separation of the system,
regarding the gravity degrees of freedom as the slow varying component and the
matter plus the Gaussian fluid as fast quantum coordinates. The slow gravity
component obeys the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and we consider a
Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin expansion of its quantum dynamics via a Planckian
parameter. The main issue of the proposed scenario is that, on one hand, we
recover a modified quantum field theory in the presence of an Hermitian
Hamiltonian (not affected by non-unitarity as in other approaches) and, on the
other hand, we get the Gaussian fluid as a physical clock for such amended
quantum theory (verifying the correct energy conditions). We also show its
equivalence with the kinematical action method, used in a previous work, in the
homogeneous setting. Then, we implement the proposed paradigm to describe the
dynamics of a homogeneous free massless scalar field, living on an isotropic
Universe, in the presence of a cosmological constant. We completely solve the
dynamics up to the first order correction in the Planckian parameter to the
standard quantum field theory. We determine the explicit form of the modified
scalar field wave-function, due to quantum features of the cosmic scale factor
evolution. Phenomenological considerations and discussions are provided.

users-developers (typically after appropriate vetting). But should this also
include interventions done as part of research on open source development?
Following an incident in which buggy code was submitted to the Linux kernel to
see whether it would be caught, we conduct a survey among open source
developers and empirical software engineering researchers to see what behaviors
they think are acceptable. This covers two main issues: the use of publicly
accessible information, and conducting active experimentation. The survey had
224 respondents. The results indicate that open-source developers are largely
open to research, provided it is done transparently. In other words, many would
agree to experiments on open-source projects if the subjects were notified and
provided informed consent, and in special cases also if only the project
leaders agree. While researchers generally hold similar opinions, they
sometimes fail to appreciate certain nuances that are important to developers.
Examples include observing license restrictions on publishing open-source code
and safeguarding the code. Conversely, researchers seem to be more concerned
than developers about privacy issues. Based on these results, it is recommended
that open source repositories and projects address use for research in their
access guidelines, and that researchers take care to ask permission also when
not formally required to do so. We note too that the open source community
wants to be heard, so professional societies and IRBs should consult with them
when formulating ethics codes.

between the intensive graphics computation of SLAM and the limited computing
capability of robots. While traditional solutions resort to the powerful cloud
servers acting as an external computation provider, we show by real-world
measurements that the significant communication overhead in data offloading
prevents its practicability to real deployment. To tackle these challenges,
this paper promotes the emerging edge computing paradigm into multi-robot SLAM
and proposes RecSLAM, a multi-robot laser SLAM system that focuses on
accelerating map construction process under the robot-edge-cloud architecture.
In contrast to conventional multi-robot SLAM that generates graphic maps on
robots and completely merges them on the cloud, RecSLAM develops a hierarchical
map fusion technique that directs robots' raw data to edge servers for
real-time fusion and then sends to the cloud for global merging. To optimize
the overall pipeline, an efficient multi-robot SLAM collaborative processing
framework is introduced to adaptively optimize robot-to-edge offloading
tailored to heterogeneous edge resource conditions, meanwhile ensuring the
workload balancing among the edge servers. Extensive evaluations show RecSLAM
can achieve up to 39% processing latency reduction over the state-of-the-art.
Besides, a proof-of-concept prototype is developed and deployed in real scenes
to demonstrate its effectiveness.

omnidirectional images (also known as 360-degree images), it is neither
equal-area nor conformal, thus not friendly to subsequent visual communication.
In the context of image compression, ERP will over-sample and deform things and
stuff near the poles, making it difficult for perceptually optimal bit
allocation. In conventional 360-degree image compression, techniques such as
region-wise packing and tiled representation are introduced to alleviate the
over-sampling problem, achieving limited success. In this paper, we make one of
the first attempts to learn deep neural networks for omnidirectional image
compression. We first describe parametric pseudocylindrical representation as a
generalization of common pseudocylindrical map projections. A computationally
tractable greedy method is presented to determine the (sub)-optimal
configuration of the pseudocylindrical representation in terms of a novel proxy
objective for rate-distortion performance. We then propose pseudocylindrical
convolutions for 360-degree image compression. Under reasonable constraints on
the parametric representation, the pseudocylindrical convolution can be
efficiently implemented by standard convolution with the so-called
pseudocylindrical padding. To demonstrate the feasibility of our idea, we
implement an end-to-end 360-degree image compression system, consisting of the
learned pseudocylindrical representation, an analysis transform, a non-uniform
quantizer, a synthesis transform, and an entropy model. Experimental results on
$19,790$ omnidirectional images show that our method achieves consistently
better rate-distortion performance than the competing methods. Moreover, the
visual quality by our method is significantly improved for all images at all

scenario of spin wave driven skyrmion motion in a ferrimagnetic (FiM) lattice

by the excited spin wave can be partitioned into a ferromagnetic term plus an
antiferromagnetic term. The ratio of these two terms and consequently the Hall
angle of skyrmion motion can be formulated as the functions of {\delta}s,
demonstrating the key role of {\delta}s as an effective control-parameter for
the skyrmion motion. Moreover, the spin wave frequency dependent skyrmion
motion is discussed, predicting the frequency enhanced skyrmion Hall motion.

recently due to the discoveries of diverse correlated and topological states in
this system. Despite the extensive research on the electron-electron
interaction effects and topological properties of the electrons, the phonons of
magic-angle TBG are relatively less explored. In this work, we study the phonon
properties in magic-angle TBG based on \textit{ab} \textit{initio} deep
potential molecular dynamics. We have calculated phonon band structures and
density of states at the magic angle, and have systematically analyzed the
phonon eigenmodes at high-symmetry points in the moir\'e Brillouin zone. In
particular, at the moir\'e $\Gamma$ point, we have discovered a number of soft
modes which can exhibit dipolar-like, stripe-like, and octupolar-like
vibrational patterns within the moir\'e supercell, as well as some ""vortical""
modes with nonzero curl in real space. At the moir\'e $K$/$K'$ points, there
are time-reversal breaking chiral phonon modes with nonzero local phonon
polarizations. We have further studied the phonon effects on the electronic
structures by freezing certain soft phonon modes. We find that if a soft
""stripe"" phonon mode at moir\'e $\Gamma$ point is assumed to be frozen, the
system would exhibit a charge order which naturally explains the recent
observations from scanning tunnelling microscopy. Moreover, there are also
low-frequency $C_{2z}$-breaking modes at moir\'e $\Gamma$ point, which would
gap out the Dirac points at the charge neutrality point once these modes get
frozen. This provides a new perspective to the origin of correlated insulator
state at the charge neutrality point.

a validity property that ensures the IM is reliable in a specific sense. The
present paper develops an IM framework for decision problems and, in
particular, investigates the decision-theoretic implications of the
aforementioned validity property. I show that a valid IM's assessment of an
action's quality, defined by a Choquet integral, will not be too optimistic
compared to that of an oracle. This ensures that a valid IM tends not to favor
actions that the oracle doesn't also favor, hence a valid IM is reliable for
decision-making too. In a certain special class of structured statistical
models, further connections can be made between the valid IM's favored actions
and those favored by other more familiar frameworks, from which certain
optimality conclusions can be drawn. An important step in these
decision-theoretic developments is a characterization of the valid IM's credal

improves robustness, scalability and execution time of the inference procedure.
We also present ReactiveMP.jl, which is a Julia package for realizing RMP

specification of local form and factorization constraints on the variational
posterior distribution, ReactiveMP.jl executes hybrid message passing
algorithms including belief propagation, variational message passing,
expectation propagation, and expectation maximisation update rules.
Experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of ReactiveMP-based

from chaotic data for use in control. Here, we introduce Physics-Informed Deep
Operator Control (PIDOC), and by encoding the control signal and initial

nonlinear system is forced to exhibit the desired trajectory given the control
signal. PIDOC receives signals as physics commands and learns from the chaotic
data output from the nonlinear van der Pol system, where the output of the PINN
is the control. Applied to a benchmark problem, PIDOC successfully implements
control with higher stochasticity for higher-order terms. PIDOC has also been
proven to be capable of converging to different desired trajectories based on
case studies. Initial positions slightly affect the control accuracy at the
beginning stage yet do not change the overall control quality. For highly
nonlinear systems, PIDOC is not able to execute control with high accuracy
compared with the benchmark problem. The depth and width of the neural network
structure do not greatly change the convergence of PIDOC based on case studies
of van der Pol systems with low and high nonlinearities. Surprisingly,
enlarging the control signal does not help to improve the control quality. The

fault identification systems. Malfunctioning any single component in
grid-connected PV systems may lead to grid instability and other serious
consequences, showing that a reliable fault identification system is the utmost
requirement for ensuring operational integrity. Therefore, this paper presents
a novel fault identification approach based on statistical signatures of PV
operational states. These signatures are unique because each fault has a
different nature and distinctive impact on the electrical system. Thus, the
Random Forest Classifier trained on these extracted signatures showed 100%
accuracy in identifying all types of faults. Furthermore, the performance
comparison of the proposed framework with other Machine Learning classifiers
depicts its credibility. Moreover, to elevate user trust in the predicted
outcomes, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanation) was utilized during the training
phase to extract a complete model response (global explanation). This extracted
global explanation can help in the assessment of predicted outcomes credibility
by decoding each prediction in terms of features contribution. Hence, the

visualization, interactive and exploratory analysis, approximate query

surprisingly overlooks the possibility of having edges of different types. In
this paper, we study the novel problem of producing summaries of multi-relation
networks, i.e., graphs where multiple edges of different types may exist
between any pair of nodes. Multi-relation graphs are an expressive model of
real-world activities, in which a relation can be a topic in social networks,
an interaction type in genetic networks, or a snapshot in temporal graphs. The
first approach that we consider for multi-relation graph summarization is a
two-step method based on summarizing each relation in isolation, and then
aggregating the resulting summaries in some clever way to produce a final
unique summary. In doing this, as a side contribution, we provide the first
polynomial-time approximation algorithm based on the k-Median clustering for
the classic problem of lossless single-relation graph summarization. Then, we
demonstrate the shortcomings of these two-step methods, and propose holistic
approaches, both approximate and heuristic algorithms, to compute a summary
directly for multi-relation graphs. In particular, we prove that the
approximation bound of k-Median clustering for the single relation solution can
be maintained in a multi-relation graph with proper aggregation operation over
adjacency matrices corresponding to its multiple relations. Experimental
results and case studies (on co-authorship networks and brain networks)

  Stateful Network Protocol Fuzzing","10 pages, 8 figures, coloured, conference",,,,"cs.SE cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The statefulness property of network protocol implementations poses a unique
challenge for testing and verification techniques, including Fuzzing. Stateful
fuzzers tackle this challenge by leveraging state models to partition the state
space and assist the test generation process. Since not all states are equally
important and fuzzing campaigns have time limits, fuzzers need effective state
selection algorithms to prioritize progressive states over others. Several
state selection algorithms have been proposed but they were implemented and
evaluated separately on different platforms, making it hard to achieve
conclusive findings. In this work, we evaluate an extensive set of state
selection algorithms on the same fuzzing platform that is AFLNet, a
state-of-the-art fuzzer for network servers. The algorithm set includes
existing ones supported by AFLNet and our novel and principled algorithm called
AFLNetLegion. The experimental results on the ProFuzzBench benchmark show that
(i) the existing state selection algorithms of AFLNet achieve very similar code
coverage, (ii) AFLNetLegion clearly outperforms these algorithms in selected
case studies, but (iii) the overall improvement appears insignificant. These
are unexpected yet interesting findings. We identify problems and share
insights that could open opportunities for future research on this topic.

  Formulation","31 pages, 9 images, 3 Tables",,,,"cs.CE cs.NA math.NA physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This study presents a generalized multiscale nonlocal elasticity theory that
leverages distributed order fractional calculus to accurately capture
coexisting multiscale and nonlocal effects within a macroscopic continuum. The
nonlocal multiscale behavior is captured via distributed order fractional
constitutive relations derived from a nonlocal thermodynamic formulation. The
governing equations of the inhomogeneous continuum are obtained via the
Hamilton principle. As a generalization of the constant order fractional
continuum theory, the distributed order theory can model complex media
characterized by inhomogeneous nonlocality and multiscale effects. In order to
understand the correspondence between microscopic effects and the properties of
the continuum, an equivalent mass-spring lattice model is also developed by
direct discretization of the distributed order elastic continuum. Detailed
theoretical arguments are provided to show the equivalence between the discrete
and the continuum distributed order models in terms of internal nonlocal
forces, potential energy distribution, and boundary conditions. These
theoretical arguments facilitate the physical interpretation of the role played
by the distributed order framework within nonlocal elasticity theories. They
also highlight the outstanding potential and opportunities offered by this
methodology to account for multiscale nonlocal effects. The capabilities of the
methodology are also illustrated via a numerical study that highlights the
excellent agreement between the displacement profiles and the total potential
energy predicted by the two models under various order distributions.
Remarkably, multiscale effects such as displacement distortion, material
softening, and energy concentration are well captured at continuum level by the
distributed order theory.
