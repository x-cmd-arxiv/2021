for performing the similar kind of malicious activities such as information
stealing, sending SMS and so on. Hence, there may exist several semantically
similar malware samples in a family/dataset. Many researchers unaware about
these semantically similar apps and use their features in their ML models for
evaluation. Hence, the performance measures might be seriously affected by
these similar kinds of apps. In this paper, we study the impact of semantically
similar applications in the performance measures of ML based Android malware
detectors. For this, we propose a novel opcode subsequence based malware
clustering algorithm to identify the semantically similar malware and goodware
apps. For studying the impact of semantically similar apps in the performance
measures, we tested the performance of distinct ML models based on API call and
permission features of malware and goodware application with/without
semantically similar apps. In our experimentation with Drebin dataset, we found
that, after removing the exact duplicate apps from the dataset (? = 0) the
malware detection rate (TPR) of API call based ML models is dropped from 0.95
to 0.91 and permission based model is dropped from 0.94 to 0.90. In order to
overcome this issue, we advise the research community to use our clustering
algorithm to get rid of semantically similar apps before evaluating their
malware detection mechanism.

introduces new techniques to differentiate Approach and Avoidance from positive

comparing word-lists, previously constructed to capture these concepts in text

Avoidance in particular is well defined as a separate type of emotion, which is

two-orbital model comprising the Ni- $3d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $3d_{xy}$- orbitals,
equipped with extended Hubbard interactions and induced low-energy effective
superexchange interactions. We then study the pairing symmetry in this system
by using large scale variational Monte Carlo approach. Our results yield the
intraorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave singlet pairing as the leading pairing symmetry
in the nickelates, which is analogous to the cuprates. However, there exist two
important differences between the physical properties of the two families due
to the fact that at the low Sr-doping regime, while the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$
orbitals remain half-filled and singly-occupied to form a Mott-insulating
background, the Ni-$3d_{xy}$ orbitals accommodate nearly all the extra doped
holes, which move freely on this background. The first difference lies in the
single-particle aspect: while the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ degree of freedom remains Mott
insulating with spectra weight pinned down at zero at low dopings, the
$3d_{xy}$ one behaves as Fermi liquid with spectra weight near 1. The second
difference lies in the pairing aspect: while the huge
intra-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital pairing gap is actually a pseudo gap which has
nothing to do with the SC, the small intra-$3d_{xy}$-orbital pairing gap serves
as the true superconducting pairing gap, which is related to the $T_c$ via the
BCS relation. Both differences can be verified by the angle-resolved
photo-emission spectrum.

reconstruct the high-dimensional information (here the CIR everywhere) from the
extremely low-dimensional data (here the location coordinates), which often
results in overfitting and large prediction error. To this end, we resort to a
novel physics-inspired generative approach. Specifically, we first use a
forward deep neural network to infer the positions of all possible images of
the source reflected by the surrounding scatterers within that environment, and
then use the well-known Gaussian Radial Basis Function network (GRBF) to
approximate the amplitudes of all possible propagation paths. We further
incorporate the most recently developed sinusoidal representation network
(SIREN) into the proposed network to implicitly represent the highly dynamic
phases of all possible paths, which usually cannot be well predicted by the
conventional neural networks with non-periodic activators. The resultant
framework of Cosine-Gaussian Radial Basis Function network (C-GRBFnet) is also
extended to the MIMO channel case. Key performance measures including
prediction accuracy, convergence speed, network scale and robustness to channel
estimation error are comprehensively evaluated and compared with existing
popular networks, which show that our proposed network is much more efficient

brief perspective I propose a synthesis that brings together for the first time
two key concepts. On the one hand, it has been suggested that the unjammed
phase of the cellular collective evolved under a selective pressure favoring
fluid-like migratory dynamics as would be required so as to accommodate
episodes of tissue evolution, development, plasticity, and repair. Being
dynamic, such an unjammed phase is expected to be energetically expensive
compared with the jammed phase, which evolved under a selective pressure
favoring a solid-like homeostatic regime that, by comparison, is non-migratory
but energetically economical and mechanically stable. On the other hand, well
before the discovery of cell jamming Kauffman proposed the general biological
principle that living systems exist in a solid regime near the edge of chaos,
and that natural selection achieves and sustains such a poised state. Here I
propose that, in certain systems at least, this poised state as predicted in
the abstract by Kaufmann is realized in the particular by the jammed regime

uncertainty have been developed in probabilistic deep learning. However, there
have not been empirical applications and extensive comparisons of these tools
in the domain of air quality forecasts. Therefore, this work applies
state-of-the-art techniques of uncertainty quantification in a real-world

on empirical performance, reliability of confidence estimate, and practical

better than previous works in quantifying uncertainty in data-driven air

scalable methods, such as deep ensemble, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and
stochastic weight averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), can perform well if applied
correctly but with different tradeoffs and slight variations in performance

the wormhole solutions in $f(R,\,T)$ gravity, which is a function of the Ricci
scalar ($R$) and the trace of the stress-energy tensor ($T$). To study wormhole
geometries, we make assumption of spherical symmetric static spacetime and the
existence of conformal Killing symmetry to get more acceptable astrophysical
outcomes. To do this, we choose the expression of $f(R,\,T)$ as $f(R,T)= R+2
\gamma T$. Here we employ the phantom energy EoS relating to radial pressure
and density given by $p_r=\omega \rho$ with $\omega<-1$ to constrain our model.
Following a discussion of wormhole geometry and behavior of shape function, the
study moves on to the computation of proper radial distance, active mass

violation of energy conditions. We have shown that the wormhole solutions exist
for positive as well as negative values of the coupling constant $\gamma$. From
our analysis we see that no wormhole solution exists for $\gamma

intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the
global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by
simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision
transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer.
Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently
outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational
overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\%$ - $1.2\%$ top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by
$2.3\%$ - $3.9\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\%$ -
$0.8\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made

sparked a surge of research interest in developing DL based clinical decision

recognition of the value of deep learning in healthcare, impediments to further
adoption in real healthcare settings remain due to the black-box nature of DL.
Therefore, there is an emerging need for interpretable DL, which allows end
users to evaluate the model decision making to know whether to accept or reject
predictions and recommendations before an action is taken. In this review, we
focus on the interpretability of the DL models in healthcare. We start by
introducing the methods for interpretability in depth and comprehensively as a
methodological reference for future researchers or clinical practitioners in
this field. Besides the methods' details, we also include a discussion of
advantages and disadvantages of these methods and which scenarios each of them
is suitable for, so that interested readers can know how to compare and choose
among them for use. Moreover, we discuss how these methods, originally
developed for solving general-domain problems, have been adapted and applied to
healthcare problems and how they can help physicians better understand these
data-driven technologies. Overall, we hope this survey can help researchers and
practitioners in both artificial intelligence (AI) and clinical fields
understand what methods we have for enhancing the interpretability of their DL

the $4d$/$5d$ transition metal compounds with the spin-orbital-entangled
${J=3/2}$ quadruplets, the rare-earth magnets with two weakly separated crystal

actually lie in the large-$N$ regime of large symmetry groups and are
characterized by strong quantum fluctuations. The Kugel-Khomskii physics and

the observed spectral energy distribution can account for the modest Fe II
emission observed in composite radio-loud spectra. However, spectral energy
differences alone cannot account for the stronger Fe II emission observed in
radio-quiet sources, for similar physical parameters. As for RL NLSy1s, they do
not seem to behave like other RL sources, likely because of their different
physical properties that could be ultimately associated with a higher Eddington

structures, these classes being quasi-ordered by embeddability. It deals with
the specific case of ordered sets of width two and the corresponding bichains
and incomparability graphs.
  Several open problems about hereditary classes of relational structures which
have been considered over the years have positive answer in this case. For
example, well-quasi-ordered hereditary classes of finite bipartite permutation
graphs, respectively finite 321-avoiding permutations, have been characterized
by Korpelainen, Lozin and Mayhill, respectively by Albert, Brignall, Ru\v{s}kuc
and Vatter.
  We provide another proof of the results mentioned above. It is based on the
existence of a countable universal poset of width two, obtained by the first
author in 1978, his notion of multichainability (1978) (a kind of analog to
letter-graphs), and metric properties of incomparability graphs. Using Laver's
theorem (1971) on better-quasi-ordering (bqo) of countable chains we prove that
a wqo hereditary class of finite or countable bipartite permutation graphs is
necessarily bqo. This gives a positive answer to a conjecture of Nash-Williams
(1965) in this case. We extend a previous result of Albert et al. by proving
that if a hereditary class of finite, respectively countable, bipartite
permutation graphs is wqo, respectively bqo, then the corresponding hereditary
classes of posets of width at most two and bichains are wqo, respectively bqo.
  Several notions of labelled wqo are also considered. We prove that they are
all equivalent in the case of bipartite permutation graphs, posets of width at
most two and the corresponding bichains. We characterize hereditary classes of
finite bipartite permutation graphs which remain wqo when labels from a wqo are
added.

selection of a new input defined as the minimizer of the distance between the
approximated output probability density function (pdf) of the reduced-order
model and the exact one. Given that the exact pdf is unknown, we define the
selection criterion as the supremum over the unit sphere of the native Hilbert
space for the GPR. The resulting selection criterion, however, has a form that
is difficult to compute. We combine results from GPR theory and asymptotic
analysis to derive a computable form of the defined optimality criterion that
is valid in the limit of small predictive variance. The derived asymptotic form
of the selection criterion leads to convergence of the GPR model that
guarantees a balanced distribution of data resources between probable and
large-deviation outputs, resulting in an effective way for sampling towards
data-driven reduced-order modeling.

quantum register under a possibly time-correlated noise acting locally on the
qubits. We model the noise as originating from an arbitrary but fixed unitary
evolution, $U$, of some noisy qubits. The noise can occur with some probability
in the interval between any pair of consecutive noiseless Grover evolutions.
Although each run of the algorithm is a unitary process, the noise model leads
to decoherence when all possible runs are considered. We derive a set of
unitary $U$'s, called the 'good noises,' for which the success probability of
the algorithm at any given time remains unchanged with varying the non-trivial
total number ($m$) of noisy qubits in the register. The result holds
irrespective of the presence of any time-correlations in the noise. We show
that only when $U$ is either of the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$
(which give rise to $m$-qubit bit-flip and phase-damping channels respectively
in the time-correlation-less case), the algorithm's success probability stays
unchanged when increasing or decreasing $m$. In contrast, when $U$ is the Pauli
matrix $\sigma_y$ (giving rise to $m$-qubit bit-phase flip channel in the
time-correlation-less case), the success probability at all times stays
unaltered as long as the parity (even or odd) of the total number $m$ remains
the same. This asymmetry between the Pauli operators stems from the inherent
symmetry-breaking existing within the Grover circuit. We further show that the
positions of the noisy sites are irrelevant in case of any of the Pauli noises.
The results are illustrated in the cases of time-correlated and
time-correlation-less noise. We find that the former case leads to a better
performance of the noisy algorithm. We also discuss physical scenarios where
our chosen noise model is of relevance.

the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA toward Sgr B2(N).
We also searched for propionamide in the same source. Neither acrylamide nor
propionamide were detected toward the two main hot molecular cores of Sgr
B2(N). We did not detect propionamide either toward a position located to the
east of the main hot core, thereby not confirming the recent claim of its
interstellar detection toward this position. We find that acrylamide and
propionamide are at least 26 and 14 times, respectively, less abundant than
acetamide toward the main hot core Sgr B2(N1S), and at least 6 and 3 times,
respectively, less abundant than acetamide toward the secondary hot core Sgr
B2(N2). A comparison with results of astrochemical kinetics model for related
species suggests that acrylamide may be a few hundred times less abundant than
acetamide, corresponding to a value at least an order of magnitude lower than
the observational upper limits. Propionamide may be as little as only a factor
of two less abundant than the upper limit derived toward Sgr B2(N1S).

novel techniques to put it into effects: (1) it encodes high-dimensional
feature maps into low-dimensional, semantic vectors for low-cost yet accurate
cache and lookup; (2) it uses a novel metric in determining the exit timing
considering different layers' inherent characteristics; (3) it adaptively
adjusts the cache size and semantic vectors to fit the scene dynamics. SMTM is
prototyped on commodity CNN engine and runs on both mobile CPU and GPU.
Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets and models show that SMTM can
significantly speed up the model inference over standard approach (up to 2X)

learning-based program analysis methods use variable name representations for a
wide range of tasks, such as suggesting new variable names and bug detection.
Ideally, such methods could capture semantic relationships between names beyond
syntactic similarity, e.g., the fact that the names average and mean are
similar. Unfortunately, previous work has found that even the best of previous
representation approaches primarily capture relatedness (whether two variables
are linked at all), rather than similarity (whether they actually have the same
meaning).
  We propose VarCLR, a new approach for learning semantic representations of
variable names that effectively captures variable similarity in this stricter
sense. We observe that this problem is an excellent fit for contrastive
learning, which aims to minimize the distance between explicitly similar
inputs, while maximizing the distance between dissimilar inputs. This requires
labeled training data, and thus we construct a novel, weakly-supervised
variable renaming dataset mined from GitHub edits. We show that VarCLR enables
the effective application of sophisticated, general-purpose language models
like BERT, to variable name representation and thus also to related downstream
tasks like variable name similarity search or spelling correction. VarCLR
produces models that significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on IdBench,
an existing benchmark that explicitly captures variable similarity (as distinct
from relatedness). Finally, we contribute a release of all data, code, and
pre-trained models, aiming to provide a drop-in replacement for variable

challenges, especially when a strong trade-off relationship exists between
shortage and wastage of perishables: A smaller inventory increases the chance
to lose sales (leading to higher expected shortage cost), while a larger
inventory increases the chance to waste perishables (leading to higher expected
wastage cost). The root cause of this strong trade-off relationship is high
product demand variability. To mitigate the issue and reduce the cost of
operating perishable inventory systems, some grocery stores utilize an opaque
selling scheme: selling an anonymous product whose brand or exact specification
is shielded from customers at the time of sale. The use of opaque products has
now become a popular means to reduce shortage/wastage at grocery stores.
However, there has been little discussion of the effectiveness of opaque
schemes applied to perishable inventory systems.
  In this paper, we propose an opaque scheme based on the balancing policy on
demand, which tries to average out orders for products. We confirm both
analytically and numerically that this opaque scheme effectively reduces
product demand variability, thereby reducing both shortage and wastage for
perishable inventory systems under a base-stock policy. We also present an
analytical formula that reveals insights into the opaque scheme: The ratio
between the opaque proportion and the coefficient of variation of product
demands plays a key role to determine the effectiveness of our opaque scheme.
Furthermore, we provide a rule of thumb to find the threshold opaque scheme
parameters needed to achieve the maximum total cost savings for perishable
inventory systems. We hope that many retailers selling perishables (e.g., fresh
produce and baked goods) find the opaque scheme useful, implement it, and
contribute to the reduction of the food wastage.

diverse and critical application areas which are currently facing several
issues like skilled labor shortage, poor safety records, and harsh work
environments. Consequently, efforts are underway to increase automation in
HDMMs for increased productivity and safety, eventually transitioning to
operator-less autonomous HDMMs to address skilled labor shortages. However,
HDMM are complex machines requiring continuous physical and cognitive inputs
from human-operators. Thus, developing autonomous HDMM is a huge challenge,
with current research and developments being performed in several independent
research domains. Through this study, we use the bounded rationality concept to
propose multidisciplinary collaborations for new autonomous HDMMs and apply the
transaction cost economics framework to suggest future implications in the HDMM
industry. Furthermore, we introduce a conceptual understanding of
collaborations in the autonomous HDMM as a unified approach, while highlighting
the practical implications and challenges of the complex nature of such
multidisciplinary collaborations. The collaborative challenges and potentials
are mapped out between the following topics: mechanical systems, AI methods,
software systems, sensors, connectivity, simulations and process optimization,
business cases, organization theories, and finally, regulatory frameworks.

  Network Model for Short-Term Load Forecasting",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Short-term load forecasting (STLF) is challenging due to complex time series
(TS) which express three seasonal patterns and a nonlinear trend. This paper
proposes a novel hybrid hierarchical deep learning model that deals with
multiple seasonality and produces both point forecasts and predictive intervals
(PIs). It combines exponential smoothing (ES) and a recurrent neural network
(RNN). ES extracts dynamically the main components of each individual TS and
enables on-the-fly deseasonalization, which is particularly useful when
operating on a relatively small data set. A multi-layer RNN is equipped with a
new type of dilated recurrent cell designed to efficiently model both short and
long-term dependencies in TS. To improve the internal TS representation and
thus the model's performance, RNN learns simultaneously both the ES parameters
and the main mapping function transforming inputs into forecasts. We compare
our approach against several baseline methods, including classical statistical
methods and machine learning (ML) approaches, on STLF problems for 35 European
countries. The empirical study clearly shows that the proposed model has high
expressive power to solve nonlinear stochastic forecasting problems with TS
including multiple seasonality and significant random fluctuations. In fact, it
outperforms both statistical and state-of-the-art ML models in terms of
accuracy.

why and when one can achieve this by iteratively creating, training, and

regularization techniques, or some distributed ML training protocols that
reduce communication/computation complexities, such as the Independent Subnet
Training protocol. While these methods are studied empirically and utilized in
practice, they often enjoy partial or no theoretical support, especially when
applied on neural network-based objectives.
  In this manuscript, our focus is on overparameterized single hidden layer
neural networks with ReLU activations in the lazy training regime. By carefully
analyzing $i)$ the subnetworks' neural tangent kernel, $ii)$ the surrogate
functions' gradient, and $iii)$ how we sample and combine the surrogate

neighborhood around the optimal point -- for an overparameterized single-hidden

the size of the neighborhood around the optimal point on the number of
surrogate models and the number of local training steps for each selected

the weights on each fundamental solution are allowed to vary as in a

bacteria transition from one state to the other. Unfortunately, these
transitions depend on a dizzyingly complex array of factors that are determined
by the intrinsic properties of the individual cells as well as those of their
surrounding environments, and are thus challenging to describe. To address this
issue, here, we develop a generally-applicable biophysical model of the
interplay between motility-mediated dispersal and biofilm formation under
positive quorum sensing control. Using this model, we establish a universal
rule predicting how the onset and extent of biofilm formation depend
collectively on cell concentration and motility, nutrient diffusion and
consumption, chemotactic sensing, and autoinducer production. Our work thus
provides a key step toward quantitatively predicting and controlling biofilm
formation in diverse and complex settings.

how resilience can be verified by combining a traditional robustness
verification technique with a data-independent stability analysis, which
identifies a subset of the feature space where the model does not change its
predictions despite adversarial manipulations. We then introduce a formally
sound data-independent stability analysis for decision trees and decision tree

to study boundary layer flows with an isolated roughness element. Wall-attached
cuboids with aspect ratios $\eta=1$ and $\eta=0.5$ are investigated for fixed
ratio of roughness height to displacement boundary layer thickness
$h/\delta^*=2.86$. Global stability analysis is able to capture the frequency
of the primary vortical structures. For $\eta=1$, only varicose instability is
seen. For the thinner roughness element ($\eta=0.5$), the varicose instability
dominates the sinuous instability, and the sinuous instability becomes more
pronounced as $Re_h$ increases, due to increased spanwise shear in the
near-wake region. The unstable modes mainly extract energy from the central
streak, although the lateral streaks also contribute. The DNS results show that
different instability features lead to different behavior and development of
vortical structures in the nonlinear transition process. For $\eta=1$, the
varicose mode is associated with the shedding of hairpin vortices. As $Re_h$
increases, the breakdown of hairpin vortices occurs closer to the roughness and
sinuous breakdown behavior promoting transition to turbulence is seen in the
farther wake. A fully-developed turbulent flow is established in both the inner
and outer layers farther downstream when $Re_h$ is sufficiently high. For
$\eta=0.5$, the sinuous wiggling of hairpin vortices is prominent at higher
$Re_h$, leading to stronger interactions in the near wake, as a result of
combined varicose and sinuous instabilities. A sinuous mode captured by dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) analysis, and associated with the `wiggling' of
streaks persists far downstream.

couplings have previously shown some fundamental connections with the pseudogap
phase and other important phases in cuprate superconductors. The anharmonicity
here suggests the importance of nonadiabatic behaviors of charge fluxes in
cuprates. These charge fluxes will result in the dynamic charge transfer that
can be directly calculated by the charge difference induced by phonons in
density functional theory simulations. However, retrieving the flux field from
the calculated charge transfer is nontrivial. In this article, a new method is
developed to solve these fluxes, which help identify anharmonically coupled
phonons as the generator of nonlocal flux flows beyond local oscillations in
cuprates, especially at high frequencies. A strength metric of such nonlocal
fluxes shows a strong correlation to the maximum superconducting transition
temperature T_(c,max) of different cuprate families. A unique picture is thus
proposed where heavy fluxes tunnel through a dynamic energy band near the Fermi
level, providing the attraction force through a Bernoulli-like mechanism for
the formation of Cooper pairs. Adding the dynamic band to our band simulation
also reproduces the flat band feature that appears below the superconducting
transition temperature Tc in previous experimental measurements.

regularization. Our approach does not require prior estimation of the
covariance structure of the functional predictors, which is computationally not

due to the inability of the celebrated reptation model to capture their
observed dynamics. Macrorheology and differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) are
powerful methods to determine entangled polymer dynamics across scales, yet
they typically require different samples under different conditions, preventing
direct coupling of bulk rheological properties to the underlying macromolecular
dynamics. Here, we perform macrorheology on composites of highly-overlapping
DNA and dextran polymers, focusing on the role of DNA topology (rings versus
linear chains) as well as the relative volume fractions of DNA and dextran. On
the same samples under the same conditions, we perform DDM and single-molecule

properties on the fraction of DNA comprising the composites, with
characteristics that are strongly dependent on the DNA topology. We rationalize

to simulate healthy femoral bone models and pathological region constraints to
identify cam bone mass. Agreement between manual and automated segmentation of

This study aims to uncover whether this problem is suited to a machine learning

prior work on detecting specific types of securities violations across
Ethereum, building classifiers based on features extracted from DeFi projects'

  Segmentation with Limited Annotation","Accepted in AAAI-22 (Oral)",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic delineation of organ-at-risk (OAR) and gross-tumor-volume (GTV) is
of great significance for radiotherapy planning. However, it is a challenging
task to learn powerful representations for accurate delineation under limited
pixel (voxel)-wise annotations. Contrastive learning at pixel-level can
alleviate the dependency on annotations by learning dense representations from
unlabeled data. Recent studies in this direction design various contrastive
losses on the feature maps, to yield discriminative features for each pixel in
the map. However, pixels in the same map inevitably share semantics to be
closer than they actually are, which may affect the discrimination of pixels in
the same map and lead to the unfair comparison to pixels in other maps. To
address these issues, we propose a separated region-level contrastive learning
scheme, namely SepaReg, the core of which is to separate each image into
regions and encode each region separately. Specifically, SepaReg comprises two
components: a structure-aware image separation (SIS) module and an intra- and
inter-organ distillation (IID) module. The SIS is proposed to operate on the
image set to rebuild a region set under the guidance of structural information.
The inter-organ representation will be learned from this set via typical
contrastive losses cross regions. On the other hand, the IID is proposed to
tackle the quantity imbalance in the region set as tiny organs may produce
fewer regions, by exploiting intra-organ representations. We conducted
extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model on a public dataset and
two private datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed model, consistently achieving better performance than
state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at

  Agents",,,,,"cs.MA cs.CY cs.GT cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The use of algorithmic decision making systems in domains which impact the
financial, social, and political well-being of people has created a demand for
these decision making systems to be ""fair"" under some accepted notion of
equity. This demand has in turn inspired a large body of work focused on the
development of fair learning algorithms which are then used in lieu of their
conventional counterparts. Most analysis of such fair algorithms proceeds from
the assumption that the people affected by the algorithmic decisions are
represented as immutable feature vectors. However, strategic agents may possess
both the ability and the incentive to manipulate this observed feature vector
in order to attain a more favorable outcome. We explore the impact that
strategic agent behavior could have on fair classifiers and derive conditions
under which this behavior leads to fair classifiers becoming less fair than
their conventional counterparts under the same measure of fairness that the
fair classifier takes into account. These conditions are related to the the way
in which the fair classifier remedies unfairness on the original unmanipulated
data: fair classifiers which remedy unfairness by becoming more selective than
their conventional counterparts are the ones that become less fair than their
counterparts when agents are strategic. We further demonstrate that both the
increased selectiveness of the fair classifier, and consequently the loss of
fairness, arises when performing fair learning on domains in which the
advantaged group is overrepresented in the region near (and on the beneficial
side of) the decision boundary of conventional classifiers. Finally, we observe
experimentally, using several datasets and learning methods, that this fairness
reversal is common, and that our theoretical characterization of the fairness
reversal conditions indeed holds in most such cases.

query with a bird name of ""Whip-poor-will"" or ""Mallard"" probably does not make
much sense. This however commonly accepted in the literature, underlines a
fundamental question interfacing AI and human -- what constitutes transferable
knowledge for human to learn from AI? This paper sets out to answer this very
question using FGVC as a test bed. Specifically, we envisage a scenario where a
trained FGVC model (the AI expert) functions as a knowledge provider in
enabling average people (you and me) to become better domain experts ourselves,
i.e. those capable in distinguishing between ""Whip-poor-will"" and ""Mallard"".
Fig. 1 lays out our approach in answering this question. Assuming an AI expert
trained using expert human labels, we ask (i) what is the best transferable
knowledge we can extract from AI, and (ii) what is the most practical means to
measure the gains in expertise given that knowledge? On the former, we propose
to represent knowledge as highly discriminative visual regions that are
expert-exclusive. For that, we devise a multi-stage learning framework, which
starts with modelling visual attention of domain experts and novices before
discriminatively distilling their differences to acquire the expert exclusive
knowledge. For the latter, we simulate the evaluation process as book guide to
best accommodate the learning practice of what is accustomed to humans. A
comprehensive human study of 15,000 trials shows our method is able to
consistently improve people of divergent bird expertise to recognise once
unrecognisable birds. Interestingly, our approach also leads to improved
conventional FGVC performance when the extracted knowledge defined is utilised

  Correlation Learning","Accepted by AAAI 2022","AAAI 2022",,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Audio-driven one-shot talking face generation methods are usually trained on
video resources of various persons. However, their created videos often suffer
unnatural mouth shapes and asynchronous lips because those methods struggle to
learn a consistent speech style from different speakers. We observe that it
would be much easier to learn a consistent speech style from a specific
speaker, which leads to authentic mouth movements. Hence, we propose a novel
one-shot talking face generation framework by exploring consistent correlations
between audio and visual motions from a specific speaker and then transferring
audio-driven motion fields to a reference image. Specifically, we develop an
Audio-Visual Correlation Transformer (AVCT) that aims to infer talking motions
represented by keypoint based dense motion fields from an input audio. In
particular, considering audio may come from different identities in deployment,
we incorporate phonemes to represent audio signals. In this manner, our AVCT
can inherently generalize to audio spoken by other identities. Moreover, as
face keypoints are used to represent speakers, AVCT is agnostic against
appearances of the training speaker, and thus allows us to manipulate face
images of different identities readily. Considering different face shapes lead
to different motions, a motion field transfer module is exploited to reduce the
audio-driven dense motion field gap between the training identity and the
one-shot reference. Once we obtained the dense motion field of the reference
image, we employ an image renderer to generate its talking face videos from an
audio clip. Thanks to our learned consistent speaking style, our method
generates authentic mouth shapes and vivid movements. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our synthesized videos outperform the state-of-the-art in

analytical chemistry, polarization manipulation and biological sensing. Here, a
chiral metasurface based on rectangular holes is systematically investigated.
The results show that the chirality is closely related to the size and the
orientation of resonance unit. It is found that the period of the structure is
always smaller than the wavelength at which chirality appears, which will
provide a good basis for the design of chiral structures. More importantly, the
CD is highly sensitive to the orientation of resonance unit. By adjusting the
rotation angle, it is not only possible to invert the CD, but also to change
the symmetry of the structure to realize the regulation of chirality. The
chirality can be significantly enhanced in the proposed structure, and the
maximum of circular dichroism (CD) can reach 0.76. To better understand the
physical mechanism, the distributions of electric field for LCP and RCP waves
are also discussed as well. This work will not only deepen the understanding of
chiral metasurfaces, but also provide guidance for the design of similar chiral
structures.

  from a Few Samples","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing",,"10.1109/TIP.2021.3131033",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advanced methods for fashion landmark detection are mainly driven by
training convolutional neural networks on large-scale fashion datasets, which
has a large number of annotated landmarks. However, such large-scale
annotations are difficult and expensive to obtain in real-world applications,
thus models that can generalize well from a small amount of labelled data are
desired. We investigate this problem of few-shot fashion landmark detection,
where only a few labelled samples are available for an unseen task. This work
proposes a novel framework named MetaCloth via meta-learning, which is able to
learn unseen tasks of dense fashion landmark detection with only a few
annotated samples. Unlike previous meta-learning work that focus on solving
""N-way K-shot"" tasks, where each task predicts N number of classes by training
with K annotated samples for each class (N is fixed for all seen and unseen
tasks), a task in MetaCloth detects N different landmarks for different
clothing categories using K samples, where N varies across tasks, because
different clothing categories usually have various number of landmarks.
Therefore, numbers of parameters are various for different seen and unseen
tasks in MetaCloth. MetaCloth is carefully designed to dynamically generate
different numbers of parameters for different tasks, and learn a generalizable
feature extraction network from a few annotated samples with a set of good
initialization parameters. Extensive experiments show that MetaCloth
outperforms its counterparts by a large margin.

approach to address this problem is quantum embedding methods. In particular,
the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) maps the original system to an effective
quantum impurity model comprising correlated orbitals embedded in an electron
bath. The biggest bottleneck in DMFT calculations is numerically solving the
quantum impurity model, i.e., computing Green's function. Past studies have
proposed theoretical methods to compute Green's function of a quantum impurity
model in polynomial time using a quantum computer. So far, however, efficient
methods for computing the imaginary-time Green's functions have not been
established despite the advantages of the imaginary-time formulation. We
propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for computing imaginary-time
Green's functions on quantum devices with limited hardware resources by
applying the variational quantum simulation. Using a quantum circuit simulator,
we verified this algorithm by computing Green's functions for a dimer model as
well as a four-site impurity model obtained by DMFT calculations of the
single-band Hubbard model, although our method can be applied to general
imaginary-time correlation functions.

However, large training sets are expensive to obtain, limiting the

focus on few-shot data-to-text generation. We observe that, while fine-tuned
pretrained language models may generate plausible sentences, they suffer from
the low semantic coverage problem in the few-shot setting. In other words,
important input slots tend to be missing in the generated text. To this end, we
propose a search-and-learning approach that leverages pretrained language
models but inserts the missing slots to improve the semantic coverage. We
further fine-tune our system based on the search results to smooth out the
search noise, yielding better-quality text and improving inference efficiency

method that explicitly accounts for annotation inaccuracies. To this end, we
treat the annotations as active contour models that can deform themselves while
preserving their topology. This enables us to jointly train the network and
correct potential errors in the original annotations. The result is an approach

scissoring modes, but they vanish at room temperature. The predicted timescales
of MA motion agree very well with experimental estimates, establishing dynamic
disordering of the molecular dipoles over several orientational minima at room

disordering of MA orientations, the transition to the cubic phase is also
associated with displacive characteristics arising from both MA as well as Br

(RMLE) problem. Challenges of the problem include 1) how to align large-scale
entities between sources to share information and 2) how to mitigate negative
transfer from joint learning multi-source data. What's worse, one practical
issue is the entanglement between both challenges. Specifically, incorrect
alignments may increase negative transfer; while mitigating negative transfer
for one source may result in poorly learned representations for other sources
and then decrease alignment accuracy. To handle the entangled challenges, we
point out that the key is to optimize information sharing first based on Pareto
front optimization, by showing that information sharing significantly
influences the Pareto front which depicts lower bounds of negative transfer.
Consequently, we proposed an Incentive Compatible Pareto Alignment (ICPA)
method to first optimize cross-source alignments based on Pareto front
optimization, then mitigate negative transfer constrained on the optimized
alignments. This mechanism renders each source can learn based on its true
preference without worrying about deteriorating representations of other
sources. Specifically, the Pareto front optimization encourages minimizing
lower bounds of negative transfer, which optimizes whether and which to align.
Comprehensive empirical evaluation results on four large-scale datasets are

spurious electrostatic interactions were corrected with the Freysoldt

a modified band alignment method is proposed in order to better predict the HSE
values from the LDA ones. The proposed method allows prediction of defect
energies with values that approximate those from the HSE functional at the
computational cost of LDA (about 20x faster for the systems studied here).
Tests of selected point defects in In-V:Bi materials resulted in corrected LDA
values having a mean absolute error (MAE)=0.175 eV for defect levels vs. HSE.
The method was further verified on an external database of defects and
impurities in CdX (X=S, Se, Te) systems, yielding a MAE=0.194 eV. These tests
demonstrate the correction to be sufficient for qualitative and
semi-quantitative predictions, and may suggest transferability to many

investigations, from predicting gravitational-wave event rates to studying
star-formation and stellar populations in clusters. However, uncertainties in
massive star evolution present a significant challenge when accounting for
these models' behaviour in stellar population studies. In this work, we present
a comparison between five published sets of stellar models from the BPASS,
BoOST, Geneva, MIST, and PARSEC simulations at near-solar metallicity. The
different sets of stellar models have been computed using slightly different
physical inputs in terms of mass-loss rates and internal mixing properties.
Moreover, these models also employ various pragmatic methods to overcome the
numerical difficulties that arise due to the presence of density inversions in
the outer layers of stars more massive than 40 M$_\odot$. These density
inversions result from the combination of inefficient convection in the
low-density envelopes of massive stars and the excess of radiative luminosity
to the Eddington luminosity. We find that the ionizing radiation released by
the stellar populations can change by up to 18 percent, the maximum radial
expansion of a star can differ between 100-1600 R$_\odot$, and the mass of the
stellar remnant can vary up to 20 M$_\odot$ between the five sets of
simulations. We conclude that any attempts to explain observations that rely on

several observed effects in massive stars. Computationally, if the luminosity
carried through radiation exceeds the local Eddington luminosity in the
low-density envelopes of massive stars, it can result in numerical
difficulties, inhibiting further computation of stellar models. This problem is
exacerbated by the fact that very few massive stars are observed beyond the
Humphreys-Davidson limit, the same region in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
where the aforementioned numerical issues relating to the Eddington luminosity
occur in stellar models. One-dimensional stellar evolution codes have to use
pragmatic solutions to evolve massive stars through this computationally
difficult phase. In this work, we quantify the impact of these solutions on the
evolutionary properties of massive stars. We used the stellar evolution code
MESA with commonly used input parameters for massive stellar models to compute
the evolution of stars in the initial mass range of 10-110 M$_\odot$ at
one-tenth of solar metallicity. We find that numerical difficulties in stellar
models with initial masses greater than or equal to 30 M$_\odot$ cause these
models to fail before the end of core helium burning. Recomputing these models
using the same physical inputs but three different pragmatic solutions to treat
the numerical instability, we find that the maximum radial expansion achieved
by stars can vary by up to 2000 R$_\odot$, while the remnant mass of the stars
can vary by up to 14 M$_\odot$ between the sets. These differences can have
implications on studies such as binary population synthesis.

our surrogate problem, relaxed from an integer optimization to a continuous

development of artificial intelligence research has created efficient methods
for solving MDPs, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), reinforcement learning
(RL), and imitation learning (IL). However, these popular models solving MDPs
are neither thoroughly tested nor rigorously reliable.
  We present MDPFuzz, the first blackbox fuzz testing framework for models
solving MDPs. MDPFuzz forms testing oracles by checking whether the target
model enters abnormal and dangerous states. During fuzzing, MDPFuzz decides
which mutated state to retain by measuring if it can reduce cumulative rewards
or form a new state sequence. We design efficient techniques to quantify the
""freshness"" of a state sequence using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and
dynamic expectation-maximization (DynEM). We also prioritize states with high
potential of revealing crashes by estimating the local sensitivity of target
models over states.
  MDPFuzz is evaluated on five state-of-the-art models for solving MDPs,
including supervised DNN, RL, IL, and multi-agent RL. Our evaluation includes
scenarios of autonomous driving, aircraft collision avoidance, and two games
that are often used to benchmark RL. During a 12-hour run, we find over 80
crash-triggering state sequences on each model. We show inspiring findings that
crash-triggering states, though they look normal, induce distinct neuron
activation patterns compared with normal states. We further develop an abnormal

of topologically nontrivial band structures, charge density wave states, giant
anomalous Hall effect, as well as unusual superconducting phase at low

instabilities for this class of materials based on first principles
calculations. We develop a method to calculate the generalized susceptibility
tensor defined in the sublattice-orbital-spin space, with the effects of
Coulomb interactions treated by generalized random phase approximation (RPA).
The RPA susceptibility calculations indicate that there are three leading
ferromagnetic instability modes at $\Gamma$ point, which are further verified
by unrestricted self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations including both the
on-site and inter-site Coulomb interactions. The inclusion of inter-site
interactions tend to suppress the spin ferromagnetism due to charge transfer
from the V to Sb sites, leading to weak spin magnetic moments $\sim
0.1\mu_{\textrm{B}}$ per V atom with small intrinsic anomalous Hall
conductivity. Current loops can be generated in such weak spin ferromagnetic
states as a result of spin-orbit coupling effects. The electronic structures in
the ferromagnetic states are significantly reconstructed which have nearly
compensated electron and hole carriers from two bands. On the other hand, we do
not find any diverging instability mode at $M$ point driven by
electron-electron Coulomb interactions. First principles phonon calculations
indicate that there are unstable phonon modes which tend to drive the system
into an inverse star-of-David structure. Our results indicate that there may be
separate phase transitions in the magnetic and charge channels in the system.

that the accretion efficiency factor also plays a very important role here and
its exact determination is essential. We have shown that the lower mass limit

(DNN) models, and thus facilitates the dissemination of sophisticated, sizable
DNN models, especially for their deployment on mobile or embedded devices.
However, the prediction results of compressed models may deviate from those of
their original models. To help developers thoroughly understand the impact of
model compression, it is essential to test these models to find those deviated
behaviors before dissemination. However, this is a non-trivial task because the
architectures and gradients of compressed models are usually not available.
  To this end, we propose DFLARE, a novel, search-based, black-box testing
technique to automatically find triggering inputs that result in deviated
behaviors in image classification tasks. DFLARE iteratively applies a series of
mutation operations to a given seed image, until a triggering input is found.
For better efficacy and efficiency, DFLARE models the search problem as Markov
Chains and leverages the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to guide the selection of
mutation operators in each iteration. Further, DFLARE utilizes a novel fitness
function to prioritize the mutated inputs that either cause large differences
between two models' outputs, or trigger previously unobserved models'
probability vectors. We evaluated DFLARE on 21 compressed models for image
classification tasks with three datasets. The results show that DFLARE
outperforms the baseline in terms of efficacy and efficiency. We also
demonstrated that the triggering inputs found by DFLARE can be used to repair
up to 48.48% deviated behaviors in image classification tasks and further
decrease the effectiveness of DFLARE on the repaired models.

most popular Russian novels of the Soviet era The Master and Margarita by
Bulgakov has been carried out. The structure of the novel is complex (a story
within a story). Moreover, the real-world-characters and the
other-world-characters are interacting in the novel. This complex and unusual
composition makes the novel especially attractive for a network analysis. In
our study, only paired verbal communications (conversations) between explicitly
present and acting characters have been taken into account. Based on a
character pair verbal communication matrix, a graph has been constructed, the
vertices of which are the characters of the novel, while the edges correspond
to the connections between them. Taking only paired verbal communications into
account leads to the result, that the character network can be described by an
ordinary, rather than a directed graph. Since the activity of the conversations
was out of our intended scope, the edges have been given no weights. The
largest connected component of the graph consists of 76 characters.
Centralities, such as degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, and
assortativity coefficient were computed to characterize the network. The
structure of the communities in the network was also analysed. In addition to
the obvious large communities-the characters from the Yershalaim part of the
novel and the characters of the Moscow part-the analysis also revealed a fine
structure in the Moscow component. Using the analysis of centralities, a group
of main characters has been detected. The central characters of the novel are
Koroviev, Margarita, Bezdomny, Woland, Behemoth, Azazello, Bosoi, Warenukha,
Master, and Levi Matthew.

revisit the lensed fraction of high-redshift quasars predicted by theoretical
models, where we adopt recent measurements of galaxy velocity dispersion
functions (VDFs) and explore a wide range of quasar luminosity function (QLF)
parameters. We use both analytical methods and mock catalogs which give
consistent results. For ordinary QLF parameters and the depth of current
high-redshift quasar surveys $(m_z\lesssim22)$, our model suggests a
multiply-imaged fraction of $F_\text{multi}\sim 0.4\%-0.8\%$. The predicted
lensed fraction is $\sim1\%-6\%$ for the brightest $z_s\sim6$ quasars
$(m_z\lesssim19)$, depending on the QLF. The systematic uncertainties of the

are dominated by the VDF. Applying VDFs from recent measurements decreases the
predicted lensed fraction and relieves the tension between observations and
theoretical models. Given the depth of current imaging surveys, there are
$\sim15$ lensed quasars at $z_s>5.5$ detectable over the sky. Upcoming sky
surveys like the LSST survey and the {\em Euclid} survey will find several tens
of lensed quasars at this redshift range.

identify a writer by their handwriting. Identification in existing writer-id
studies requires a complete document or text, limiting the scalability and
flexibility of writer-id in realistic applications. To make the application of
writer-id more practical (e.g., on mobile devices), we focus on a novel
problem, letter-level online writer-id, which requires only a few trajectories
of written letters as identification cues. Unlike text-\ document-based
writer-id which has rich context for identification, there are much fewer clues

a person often writes a letter in different styles from time to time. We refer
to this problem as the variance of online writing styles (Var-O-Styles). We
address the Var-O-Styles in a capture-normalize-aggregate fashion: Firstly, we
extract different features of a letter trajectory by a carefully designed
multi-branch encoder, in an attempt to capture different online writing styles.
Then we convert all these style features to a reference style feature domain by
a novel normalization layer. Finally, we aggregate the normalized features by a
hierarchical attention pooling (HAP), which fuses all the input letters with

contribute a large-scale LEtter-level online wRiter IDentification dataset

knowledge-driven approaches so that model behaviour and the final prediction
process became a black box. The proposed SyntEO approach enables Earth
observation researchers to automatically generate large deep learning ready

including expert knowledge in the data generation process in a highly
structured manner to control the automatic image and label generation by
employing an ontology. In this way, fully controllable experiment environments
are set up, which support insights in the model training on the synthetic data
sets. Thus, SyntEO makes the learning process approachable, which is an
important cornerstone for explainable machine learning. We demonstrate the
SyntEO approach by predicting offshore wind farms in Sentinel-1 images on two
of the worlds largest offshore wind energy production sites. The largest
generated data set has 90,000 training examples. A basic convolutional neural
network for object detection, that is only trained on this synthetic data,
confidently detects offshore wind farms by minimising false detections in
challenging environments. In addition, four sequential data sets are generated,

computational complexity, ineffective in inducing sparsity, and incapable of
handling complex matrix estimation. To mitigate all the aforementioned

framework built upon the proximal operator method to tackle the JADCE problem
in IoT networks, where the base station is equipped with multiple antennas.
Specifically, the JADCE problem is formulated as a group-sparse-matrix

we develop two additional unfolding structures to reduce the training

important implications for planet formation. This work thus shows that the
ongoing and future observations of the wind mass loss rate for protoplanetary

derivative-free optimization of a Monte Carlo rollout acquisition function.
Methods that use the reparameterization trick for more efficient
derivative-based optimization of non-myopic acquisition functions in the

perturbation analysis, do not extend: constraints introduce discontinuities in
the sampled acquisition function surface that hinder its optimization.
Moreover, we argue here that being non-myopic is even more important in
constrained problems because fear of violating constraints pushes myopic
methods away from sampling the boundary between feasible and infeasible
regions, slowing the discovery of optimal solutions with tight constraints. In
this paper, we propose a computationally efficient two-step lookahead

optimization, we develop a novel likelihood-ratio-based unbiased estimator of

cold dark matter along with slow-roll inflation. The dark energy density is
found to be of order $({\rm a \;few \;meV})^4$, and the mass of dark matter
constituent is $\approx 1\,$ meV. These numbers are given in terms of the
present value of Hubble constant $H_0$ and the Plank energy $1/\sqrt{16 \pi
G_N}$: they are $(H_0 M_{\rm P})^2$ for the energy density and $(H_0 M_{\rm
P})^{1/2}$ for the dark matter constituent mass. The basic framework is a
multi-scalar tensor gravity with non-trivial conformal coupling to the Ricci
scalar curvature in the lagrangian density. The key for a right amount of dark
energy is to incorporate in a novel way the spatially homogeneous kinetic
contribution of Nambu-Goldstone modes in a spontaneously broken multi-scalar
field sector. Proposed theories are made consistent with general relativity
tests at small cosmological distances, yet are different from general
relativity at cosmological scales. Dark matter is generated as spatially
inhomogeneous component of the scalar system, with roughly comparable amount to
the dark energy. In some presented models a cosmological bifurcation of
symmetry breaking of scalar sector is triggered by the spontaneous breaking of
electroweak SU(2) $\times $ U(1) gauge symmetry, hence the separation occurring

its high density, non-volatility, and high endurance. However, achieving high
memory fidelity incurs significant write-energy costs, which should be reduced
for large-scale deployment of MRAMs. In this paper, we formulate a
\emph{biconvex} optimization problem to optimize write fidelity given energy
and latency constraints. The basic idea is to allocate non-uniform write pulses
depending on the importance of each bit position. The fidelity measure we
consider is mean squared error (MSE), for which we optimize write pulses via
\emph{alternating convex search (ACS)}. By using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions, we derive analytic solutions and propose an \emph{iterative
water-filling-type} algorithm by leveraging the analytic solutions. Hence, the
proposed iterative water-filling algorithm is computationally more efficient
than the original ACS while their solutions are identical. Although the
original ACS and the proposed iterative water-filling algorithm do not
guarantee global optimality, the MSEs obtained by the proposed algorithm are
comparable to the MSEs by complicated global nonlinear programming solvers.
Furthermore, we prove that the proposed algorithm can reduce the MSE
exponentially with the number of bits per word. For an 8-bit accessed word, the
proposed algorithm reduces the MSE by a factor of 21. We also evaluate the
proposed algorithm for MNIST dataset classification supposing that the model
parameters of deep neural networks are stored in MRAMs. The numerical results
show that the optimized write pulses can achieve \SI{40}{\%} write energy
reduction for a given classification accuracy.

computational resources are limited. Optimal measurement scheduling is an
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. The so-called sequential greedy
(SG) algorithm is a popular suboptimal polynomial-time solution for this
problem. However, the merit function evaluation for the SG algorithms requires
access to the state estimate vector and error covariance matrix of all the
landmark agents (teammates that an agent can take measurements from). This
paper proposes a measurement scheduling for CL that follows the SG approach but
reduces the communication and computation cost by using a neural network-based
surrogate model as a proxy for the SG algorithm's merit function. The
significance of this model is that it is driven by local information and only a
scalar metadata from the landmark agents. This solution addresses the time and
memory complexity issues of running the SG algorithm in three ways: (a)
reducing the inter-agent communication message size, (b) decreasing the

research are available. In this paper, we facilitate the research by providing
large-scale datasets, and use them to examine the usage of the Decision
Transformer in the context of MARL. We investigate the generalisation of MARL
offline pre-training in the following three aspects: 1) between single agents
and multiple agents, 2) from offline pretraining to the online fine-tuning, and
3) to that of multiple downstream tasks with few-shot and zero-shot
capabilities. We start by introducing the first offline MARL dataset with
diverse quality levels based on the StarCraftII environment, and then propose
the novel architecture of multi-agent decision transformer (MADT) for effective
offline learning. MADT leverages transformer's modelling ability of sequence
modelling and integrates it seamlessly with both offline and online MARL tasks.
A crucial benefit of MADT is that it learns generalisable policies that can
transfer between different types of agents under different task scenarios. On
StarCraft II offline dataset, MADT outperforms the state-of-the-art offline RL
baselines. When applied to online tasks, the pre-trained MADT significantly
improves sample efficiency, and enjoys strong performance both few-short and

demonstrates the effectiveness of offline pre-trained models in terms of sample

Leveraging the rich subjective scores of the natural images, we can quest the
evaluation criteria of human perception via DNN and transfer the capability of
prediction to 3D point clouds. In particular, we treat natural images as the
source domain and point clouds as the target domain, and infer point cloud
quality via unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation. To extract effective

feature encoder and a conditional-discriminative network. Considering that the
ultimate purpose is regressing objective score, we introduce a novel
conditional cross entropy loss in the conditional-discriminative network to
penalize the negative samples which hinder the convergence of the quality

Specifically, we assemble the modulators with a cascaded propagation-correction

7,8,9,10\}$. We refute this conjecture by showing that the picture is different
for bigger alphabets. We prove that critical exponents of balanced sequences
over an alphabet of size $d\geq 11$ are lower bounded by $\frac{d-1}{d-2}$ and
this bound is attained for all even numbers $d\geq 12$. According to this
result, we conjecture that the least critical exponent of a balanced sequence
over $d$ letters is $\frac{d-1}{d-2}$ for all $d\geq 11$.

approach is when a citizen discloses his personally identifiable information to
both the HA a TC, if the test result comes positive, the information is used by
the TC to alert the HA. Along with this, there can be other trusted entities
that have other key elements of data related to the citizen. However, the

where each player can only observe its reward at each time -- determined by all
players' current joint action -- rather than its gradient. We focus on the
class of smooth and strongly monotone games and study optimal no-regret
learning therein. Leveraging self-concordant barrier functions, we first
construct a new bandit learning algorithm and show that it achieves the
single-agent optimal regret of $\tilde{\Theta}(n\sqrt{T})$ under smooth and
strongly concave reward functions ($n \geq 1$ is the problem dimension). We
then show that if each player applies this no-regret learning algorithm in
strongly monotone games, the joint action converges in the last iterate to the
unique Nash equilibrium at a rate of $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{\frac{n^2}{T}})$.
Prior to our work, the best-known convergence rate in the same class of games
is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt[3]{\frac{n^2}{T}})$ (achieved by a different algorithm),
thus leaving open the problem of optimal no-regret learning algorithms (since
the known lower bound is $\Omega(\sqrt{\frac{n^2}{T}})$). Our results thus
settle this open problem and contribute to the broad landscape of bandit
game-theoretical learning by identifying the first doubly optimal bandit
learning algorithm, in that it achieves (up to log factors) both optimal regret
in the single-agent learning and optimal last-iterate convergence rate in the
multi-agent learning. We also present results on several application studies --
Cournot competition, Kelly auctions, and distributed regularized logistic

point cloud. Motivated by the success of transformers, we propose Point
Tracking TRansformer (PTTR), which efficiently predicts high-quality 3D
tracking results in a coarse-to-fine manner with the help of transformer
operations. PTTR consists of three novel designs. 1) Instead of random
sampling, we design Relation-Aware Sampling to preserve relevant points to
given templates during subsampling. 2) Furthermore, we propose a Point Relation
Transformer (PRT) consisting of a self-attention and a cross-attention module.
The global self-attention operation captures long-range dependencies to enhance
encoded point features for the search area and the template, respectively.
Subsequently, we generate the coarse tracking results by matching the two sets
of point features via cross-attention. 3) Based on the coarse tracking results,
we employ a novel Prediction Refinement Module to obtain the final refined
prediction. In addition, we create a large-scale point cloud single object
tracking benchmark based on the Waymo Open Dataset. Extensive experiments show
that PTTR achieves superior point cloud tracking in both accuracy and

relies on the denoising filter in estimating Photo-Response Non-Uniformity
(PRNU). Given various attempts on enhancing the quality of the extracted PRNU,
it still suffers from unsatisfactory performance in low-resolution images and
high computational demand. Leveraging the similarity of PRNU estimation and
image denoising, we take advantage of the latest achievements of Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN)-based denoisers for PRNU extraction. In this paper, a
comparative evaluation of such CNN denoisers on SCI performance is carried out
on the public ""Dresden Image Database"". Our findings are two-fold. From one
aspect, both the PRNU extraction and image denoising separate noise from the
image content. Hence, SCI can benefit from the recent CNN denoisers if
carefully trained. From another aspect, the goals and the scenarios of PRNU
extraction and image denoising are different since one optimizes the quality of
noise and the other optimizes the image quality. A carefully tailored training
is needed when CNN denoisers are used for PRNU estimation. Alternative
strategies of training data preparation and loss function design are analyzed
theoretically and evaluated experimentally. We point out that feeding the CNNs
with image-PRNU pairs and training them with correlation-based loss function
result in the best PRNU estimation performance. To facilitate further studies
of SCI, we also propose a minimum-loss camera fingerprint quantization scheme
using which we save the fingerprints as image files in PNG format. Furthermore,
we make the quantized fingerprints of the cameras from the ""Dresden Image
Database"" publicly available.

this paper, a new ecosystem of ML model trading over a trusted Blockchain-based

market, and interested sellers spend local computations on their data to
enhance that model's quality. In doing so, the proportional relation between
the local data and the quality of trained models is considered, and the
valuations of seller's data in training the models are estimated through the
distributed Data Shapley Value (DSV). At the same time, the trustworthiness of
the entire trading process is provided by the distributed Ledger Technology

Vehicles (MAVs) have increased applications due to their small size, better
maneuverability, and remote operability. Non-conventional designs, such as
closed box-wing structures, have reduced induced drag, enabling a higher
payload capacity, endurance, and aerodynamic efficiency. Current studies have
widely studied the applicability of box-wing for large commercial aircraft,
general aviation, and medium to large UAVs. Despite the increased work on
non-conventional wing aircraft, little has been studied about the applicability
of box-wing design over a monoplane in the MAV scale and the choice of
parameters that enable the box wing to be best suited. This work presents
numerical simulation results for box-wing configurations in contrast with the
conventional monowing design, considering operations at lower Reynolds numbers
and aspect ratios suitable for small UAV operations. We study the effects of
lift, skin friction, and induced drag along with aerodynamic efficiency for six
structures. It is intuitive to expect that the decreased induced drag would
prove the box-wing design outperformed the conventional design. However, the
additional parasitic drag generated makes the monowing model a slightly better
choice. The simulations reveal that the box-wing lowers induced drag by 2 to
12% compared to a monowing aircraft but produces a lesser total lift to drag
ratio by 10% at equal lift requirement. Our analysis also addresses the effect
of varying aspect ratios and Reynolds numbers on the simulation results for the
box-wing and monowing designs and discusses the suitability of choosing a
particular structure based on mission requirements.

acquisition of accurate channel state information in holographic massive MIMO
systems is crucial. In this paper, we propose a channel estimation scheme based
on a parametric physical channel model for line-of-sight (LoS) dominated
communication in millimeter and terahertz wave bands. The proposed channel
estimation scheme exploits the specific structure of the radiated beams
generated by the continuous surface to estimate the channel parameters in a
dominated LoS channel model. The training overhead and computational complexity
of the proposed scheme do not scale with the number of antennas. The simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed estimation scheme significantly
outperforms other benchmark schemes in poor scattering environment.

integrating encryption into its transport functionality. In this process, it
hides transport layer information often used for network monitoring, thus
obsoleting traditional measurement concepts. To still enable passive RTT
estimations, QUIC introduces a dedicated measurement bit - the spin bit. While
simple in its design, tracking the spin bit at line-rate can become challenging
for software-based solutions. Dedicated hardware trackers are also unsuitable
as the spin bit is not invariant and can change in the future. Thus, this paper
investigates whether P4-programmable hardware, such as the Intel Tofino, can
effectively track the spin bit at line-rate. We find that the core
functionality of the spin bit can be realized easily, and our prototype has an
accuracy close to software-based trackers. Our prototype further protects
against faulty measurements caused by reordering and prepares the data
according to the needs of network operators, e.g., by classifying samples into
pre-defined RTT classes. Still, distinct concepts in QUIC, such as its
connection ID, are challenging with current hardware capabilities.

cocoa production combines high yields with biodiversity friendly management
into a climate adapted smart agroforestry system (SAS). As pollination
limitation is a key driver of global production, we use data of more than

manually enhancing cocoa pollination (hereafter manual pollination) can produce
SAS. Manual pollination can triple farm yields and double farmers annual profit

increase global cocoa supplies by up to 13%. We propose a win win scenario to
mitigate negative long term price and socioeconomic effects, whereby manual
pollination compensates only for yield losses resulting from climate and
disease related decreases in production area and conversion of monocultures

the stable sums method. Our goal is to incorporate time and space extreme

large deviations of regularly varying stationary time series. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that our novel approach enhances return levels
inference in two ways. First, it is robust concerning time dependencies. We
implement it alike on independent and dependent observations. In the univariate
setting, it improves the accuracy of confidence intervals compared to the main
estimators requiring temporal de-clustering. Second, it thoughtfully integrates

has a smaller mean squared error than its component-wise implementation. We
apply our method to infer high return levels of daily fall precipitation

In correlated systems, however, key phenomena crucially depend on dynamical
processes, too: In a Mott insulator, the electrons' spin moment fluctuates in
time, while it is dynamically screened in Kondo systems. Here, we introduce a
timescale $t_m$ characteristic for the screening of the local spin moment and
demonstrate that it fully characterizes the dynamical mean-field phase diagram
of the Hubbard model: The retarded magnetic response delineates the Mott
transition and provides a new perspective on its signatures in the
supercritical region above. We show that $t_m$ has knowledge of the Widom line
and that it can be used to demarcate the Fermi liquid from the bad metal
regime. Additionally, it reveals new structures inside the Fermi liquid phase:
First, we identify a region with preformed local moments that we suggest to
have a thermodynamic signature. Second, approaching the Mott transition from
weak coupling, we discover a regime in which the spin dynamics becomes
adiabatic, in the sense that it is much slower than valence fluctuations. Our
findings provide resolution limits for magnetic measurements and may build a
bridge to the relaxation dynamics of non-equilibrium states.

People in the crowd then compete with each other to win the rewards. Although
in real life, a crowd is usually networked and people influence each other via
social ties, existing crowdsourcing contest theories do not aim to answer how
interpersonal relationships influence people's incentives and behaviors and
thereby affect the crowdsourcing performance. In this work, we novelly take
people's social ties as a key factor in the modeling and designing of agents'
incentives in crowdsourcing contests. We establish two contest mechanisms by
which the principal can impel the agents to invite their neighbors to
contribute to the task. The first mechanism has a symmetric Bayesian Nash
equilibrium, and it is very simple for agents to play and easy for the
principal to predict the contest performance. The second mechanism has an
asymmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and agents' behaviors in equilibrium show
a vast diversity which is strongly related to their social relations. The
Bayesian Nash equilibrium analysis of these new mechanisms reveals that,
besides agents' intrinsic abilities, the social relations among them also play
a central role in decision-making. Moreover, we design an effective algorithm
to automatically compute the Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the invitation
crowdsourcing contest and further adapt it to a large graph dataset. Both
theoretical and empirical results show that the new invitation crowdsourcing
contests can substantially enlarge the number of participants, whereby the
principal can obtain significantly better solutions without a large

achieving a reliable camera system, in this paper, we make an attempt to train
such a robust detector. Unfortunately, to build a well-performing detector
across varying imaging conditions, one would require labeled training images
(often in large numbers) from a plethora of corner cases. As manually obtaining
such a large labeled dataset may be infeasible, we suggest using synthetic
images, to mimic different training image domains. We propose a novel,
contrastive learning method to align the latent representations of a pair of

domains. However, we found that merely contrasting the embeddings may lead to
catastrophic forgetting of the information essential for object detection.
Hence, we employ a continual learning based penalty, to alleviate the issue of
forgetting, while contrasting the representations. We showcase that our

at the same time as large wind power expansions are expected, resulting in even
greater exposure to weather risk. In this study, we quantify the increase in
weather risk resulting from replacing fossil fuels with power for heating in
the Nordic region, at the same time as variable renewable generation expands.
First, we calibrate statistical weather-driven power consumption models for
each of the countries Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. Then, we modify the
weather sensitivity of the models to simulate different levels of heating
electrification, and use 300 simulated weather years to investigate how
differing weather conditions impact power consumption at each electrification
level. The results show that full replacement of fossil fuels by power for
heating in 2040 leads to an increase in annual consumption of 155 TWh (30%)
compared to a business-as-usual scenario during an average weather year, but a
178 TWh (34%) increase during a one-in-twenty weather year. However, the
increase in the peak consumption is greater: around 50% for a normal weather
year, and 70% for a one-in-twenty weather year. Furthermore, wind and solar
generation contribute little during the consumption peaks. The increased
weather sensitivity caused by heating electrification causes greater total
load, but also causes a significant increase in inter-annual, seasonal, and
intra-seasonal variations. We conclude that heating electrification must be
accompanied by an increase in power system flexibility to ensure a stable and
secure power supply.

long-term memory feature of dynamical spin correlations can be precisely
quantified by computing the difference between the zero-frequency limit of the
Kubo susceptibility and the corresponding static isothermal one. Here, we
present a procedure for reliably evaluating this difference starting from
imaginary time-axis data, and apply it to the testbed case of the Mott-Hubbard

effects in the entire Mott regime, abruptly ending at the first order MIT. This
directly reflects the underlying local moment physics and the associated
degeneracy in the many-electron spectrum. At higher temperatures, a more
gradual onset of an infinitely-long time-decay of magnetic correlations occurs
in the crossover regime, not too far from the Widom line emerging from the
critical point of the MIT. Our work has relevant algorithmic implications for
the analytical continuation of dynamical susceptibilities in strongly
correlated regimes and offers a new perspective for unveiling fundamental
properties of the many-particle spectrum of the problem under scrutiny.

leakage, but in contrast for the power output. From the curves, we assured that

identification, i.e., identifying fashion products that match exactly in their
design (or style), but only to differ in their color. We propose a generic
framework, that leverages deep visual Representation Learning at its heart, to
address this problem for our fashion e-commerce platform. Our framework could
be trained with supervisory signals in the form of triplets, that are obtained
manually. However, it is infeasible to obtain manual annotations for the entire
huge collection of data usually present in fashion e-commerce platforms, such
as ours, while capturing all the difficult corner cases. But, to our rescue,
interestingly we observed that this crucial problem in fashion e-commerce could
also be solved by simple color jitter based image augmentation, that recently
became widely popular in the contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
literature, that seeks to learn visual representations without using manual
labels. This naturally led to a question in our mind: Could we leverage SSL in
our use-case, and still obtain comparable performance to our supervised
framework? The answer is, Yes! because, color variant fashion objects are
nothing but manifestations of a style, in different colors, and a model trained
to be invariant to the color (with, or without supervision), should be able to
recognize this! This is what the paper further demonstrates, both
qualitatively, and quantitatively, while evaluating a couple of

within the core of the jet, appearing to a misaligned observer in the X-ray
band because of less favorable Doppler boosting. These flares appear during the
afterglow phase because of core--observer light travel delays. In this picture,
the prompt emission recorded by this observer comes from material along their
line of sight, in the lateral structure of the jet, outside the jet's core. We
start by laying down the basic analytical framework to determine the flares
characteristics as a function of those of the gamma-ray pulse an aligned
observer would see. We show that there is viable parameter space to explain
flares with typical observing times and luminosities. We then analytically
explore this model, showing that it naturally produces flares with small aspect
ratios, as observed. We perform fits of our model to two $Swift$/XRT flares
representing two different types of morphology, to show that our model can
capture both. The ejection time of the core jet material responsible of the
flare is a critical parameter. While it always remains small compared to the
observed time of the flare, confirming that our model does not require very
late central engine activity, late ejection times are strongly favored,
sometimes larger than the observed duration of the parent gamma-ray burst's

are jointly training a machine learning model. Instead, these devices share
gradients, parameters, or other model updates, with a central party (e.g., a
company) coordinating the training. Because data never ""leaves"" personal
devices, FL is often presented as privacy-preserving. Yet, recently it was
shown that this protection is but a thin facade, as even a passive,
honest-but-curious attacker observing gradients can reconstruct data of
individual users contributing to the protocol. In this work, we show a novel
data reconstruction attack which allows an active and dishonest central party
to efficiently extract user data from the received gradients. While prior work
on data reconstruction in FL relies on solving computationally expensive
optimization problems or on making easily detectable modifications to the
shared model's architecture or parameters, in our attack the central party
makes inconspicuous changes to the shared model's weights before sending them
out to the users. We call the modified weights of our attack trap weights. Our
active attacker is able to recover user data perfectly, i.e., with zero error,
even when this data stems from the same class. Recovery comes with near-zero
costs: the attack requires no complex optimization objectives. Instead, our
attacker exploits inherent data leakage from model gradients and simply
amplifies this effect by maliciously altering the weights of the shared model
through the trap weights. These specificities enable our attack to scale to
fully-connected and convolutional deep neural networks trained with large

the presence of domain shift between data of different PV plants. Instead, we
frame fault detection as more realistic unsupervised domain adaptation problem
where we train on labelled data of one source PV plant and make predictions on
another target plant. We train a ResNet-34 convolutional neural network with a
supervised contrastive loss, on top of which we employ a k-nearest neighbor
classifier to detect anomalies. Our method achieves a satisfactory area under
the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 73.3 % to 96.6 % on nine
combinations of four source and target datasets with 2.92 million IR images of
which 8.5 % are anomalous. It even outperforms a binary cross-entropy
classifier in some cases. With a fixed decision threshold this results in 79.4
% and 77.1 % correctly classified normal and anomalous images, respectively.
Most misclassified anomalies are of low severity, such as hot diodes and small
hot spots. Our method is insensitive to hyperparameter settings, converges
quickly and reliably detects unknown types of anomalies making it well suited
for practice. Possible uses are in automatic PV plant inspection systems or to
streamline manual labelling of IR datasets by filtering out normal images.
Furthermore, our work serves the community with a more realistic view on PV

properties of networks and generate static rankings, in this work we propose a
novel method that is responsive to any change in the diffusion dynamics. The
main idea is to approximate the influential ability (influentiality) of a node
with the reachability of other nodes from that node in a set of random
sub-graphs. To this end, several random sub-graphs are sampled from the
original network and then a hyper-graph is created in which each sub-graph is
represented with a hyper-edge. From a theoretical standpoint, one can argue
that a factor of the degree of nodes in the hyper-graph approximates
influentiality. From an empirical perspective, the proposed model not only
achieves the highest correlation with the ground-truth ranking, but also the
ranking generated by this method hits the highest level of uniqueness and
uniformity. Theoretical and practical analysis of the running time of this
method also confirms a competitive running time compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

burning precedes the dynamical breakout. During this \textit{simmering} phase,
$e-$captures are energetically favored in the central region of the star, while
$\beta-$decays are favored more outside, and the two zones are connected by a
growing convective instability. We analyze the interplay between weak
interactions and convection, the so-called convective URCA process, during the
simmering phase of SNe Ia progenitors and its effects on the physical and
chemical properties at the explosion epoch. At variance with previous studies,
we find that the convective core powered by the carbon burning remains confined
within the ${^{21}(Ne,F)}$ URCA shell. As a result, a much larger amount of
carbon has to be consumed before the explosion which eventually occurs at
larger density than previously estimated. In addition, we find that the
extension of the convective core and its average neutronization depend on the
the WD progenitor initial metallicity. For the average neutronization in the
convective core at the explosion epoch we obtain ${\overline{\eta}_{exp}} =
(1.094\pm 0.143)\times 10^{-3} + (9.168\pm 0.677)\times 10^{-2}\times Z$.
Outside the convective core, the neutronization is instead determined by the
initial amount of C+N+O in the progenitor star. Since S, Ca, Cr and Mn, the
elements usually exploited to evaluate the pre-explosive neutronization, are
mainly produced outside the heavily neutronized core, the problem of too high
metallicity estimated for the progenitors of the historical Tycho and Kepler
SNe Ia remains unsolved.

  We present CSX, a domain-specific language for high-level declarative

parameters and the automated exploration of the configuration space of
finishers. The language serves as an interface to constraint solving, i.e., we
use low-level SMT constraint solving to find configurations for high-level

implementation of the CSX compiler and the CSX programming environment (IDE),

show that size measurements can be reliably measured up to linear

we measure span a >1-dex range, from <50 pc to >~500 pc. Uncertainties are
based on both the formal fit errors and systematic differences between the
public lensing models. These uncertainties range from ~20 pc for the smallest
sources to 50 pc for the largest. Using a forward-modeling procedure to model
the impact of incompleteness and magnification uncertainties, we characterize
the size-luminosity relation at both z~4 and z~6-8. We find that the source

a steeper size-luminosity relation (3 sigma) adds to earlier evidence for small

  Inequality Restrictions",,,,,"stat.ME stat.CO stat.OT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Univariate and multivariate general linear regression models, subject to
linear inequality constraints, arise in many scientific applications. The
linear inequality restrictions on model parameters are often available from
phenomenological knowledge and motivated by machine learning applications of
high-consequence engineering systems (Agrell, 2019; Veiga and Marrel, 2012).
Some studies on the multiple linear models consider known linear combinations
of the regression coefficient parameters restricted between upper and lower
bounds. In the present paper, we consider both univariate and multivariate
general linear models subjected to this kind of linear restrictions. So far,
research on univariate cases based on Bayesian methods is all under the
condition that the coefficient matrix of the linear restrictions is a square
matrix of full rank. This condition is not, however, always feasible. Another
difficulty arises at the estimation step by implementing the Gibbs algorithm,
which exhibits, in most cases, slow convergence. This paper presents a Bayesian
method to estimate the regression parameters when the matrix of the constraints
providing the set of linear inequality restrictions undergoes no condition. For
the multivariate case, our Bayesian method estimates the regression parameters
when the number of the constrains is less than the number of the regression
coefficients in each multiple linear models. We examine the efficiency of our
Bayesian method through simulation studies for both univariate and multivariate
regressions. After that, we illustrate that the convergence of our algorithm is
relatively faster than the previous methods. Finally, we use our approach to
analyze two real datasets.

directly in the Newton iterate with regularization parameter proportional to
the square root of the norm of the current gradient. For the basic scheme, as
applied to the composite optimization problem, we establish the global
convergence rate of the order $O(k^{-2})$ both in terms of the functional
residual and in the norm of subgradients. Our main assumption on the smooth
part of the objective is Lipschitz continuity of its Hessian. For uniformly
convex functions of degree three, we justify global linear rate, and for
strongly convex function we prove the local superlinear rate of convergence.
Our approach can be seen as a relaxation of the Cubic Regularization of the
Newton method, which preserves its convergence properties, while the auxiliary
subproblem at each iteration is simpler. We equip our method with adaptive line

observation with its unique advantages. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive
ship detector using full-polarization SAR images. First, by thoroughly
investigating the scattering characteristics between ships and their
background, and the wave polarization anisotropy, a novel ship detector is
proposed by jointing the two characteristics, named Scattering-Anisotropy joint
(joint-SA). Based on the theoretical analysis, we showed that the joint-SA is
an effective physical quantity to show the difference between the ship and its
background, and thus joint-SA can be used for ship detection of
full-polarization image data. Second, the generalized Gamma distribution was
used to characterize the joint-SA statistics of sea clutter with a large range
of homogeneity. As a result, an adaptive constant false alarm rate (CFAR)
method was implemented based on the joint-SA. Finally, RADARSAT-2 and GF-3 data
in C-band and ALOS data in L-band are used for verification. We tested on five
datasets, and the experimental results verify the correctness and superiority
of the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) method based on the joint-SA. In
addition, the experimental results also showed that the signal-clutter ratio
(SCR) of the proposed ship detector joint-SA (33.17 dB, 35.98 dB, 57.25 dB) is
better than that of DBSP (8.92 dB, 3.43 dB, 25.40 dB) and RsDVH (17.28 dB,

higher detection accuracy and a lower false alarm rate.

properties that are not consistent with several existing density functional
theory studies. Our study is based on a wide set of Hubbard-corrected density
functional tight binding (DTFB+U) and hybrid density functional theory (HSE06)
calculations on Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$ nanocubes of more than 400 atoms. We provide a
new explanation for the spin ordering in coated nanoparticles, through the
investigation of spin-flipping phenomena. In particular, we show that the
spin-flip of d electrons at octahedral Fe$^{3+}$ sites, which is confirmed to
be more favorable near the surface, especially where atomic reorganization can
take place such as at corner sites, can be hampered by the presence of adsorbed
organic acids because they do not only limit the surface reconstruction but
also allow for additional ferromagnetic superexchange interaction between
octahedral Fe sites as a consequence of the carboxylates bridging binding mode.
The proof-of-concept of this mechanism is given by a simplified model of the
Fe(III) tert-butoxide dimer.

intense neutrino beam at Fermilab (Chicago - USA), of a near detector to
monitor the beam and a far detector installed in the Sanford Underground
Research Facility (SURF), 1300 km far away. Four 10 kt Liquid Argon Time
Projection Chambers (LArTPC) will compose the 40 kt far detector modules to
perform the precise measurements required for DUNE. The experimental technique
uses charge and light signal from ionizing radiations in liquid argon to fully
reconstruct neutrino interactions with excellent spatial resolution,
calorimetric measurements and particle identification.
  The liquid argon scintillation light is produced around 127 nm within a few
nanoseconds from the radiation passage. Its detection may improve the LArTPC
calorimetric besides giving the time stamp of non-beam events, which is vital
in fiducializing nucleon-decay events. The DUNE Photon Detection System (PDS)
is responsible to efficiently collect this light in order to fiducialize the
active volume of the detector with $>99\%$ efficiency. The PDS will be composed
by 1,500 X-ARAPUCA modules, a light trapping device that was the main subject
of this thesis.
  In this work, the research and development of the ARAPUCA devices will be

glow) in eccentric debris discs are often used to infer the underlying orbits
of the dust and planetesimals that comprise the disc. However, there is a
misconception that eccentric discs have higher surface densities at apocentre
and thus necessarily exhibit apocentre glow at long wavelengths. This arises
from the expectation that the slower velocities at apocentre lead to a ""pile
up'"" of dust, which fails to account for the greater area over which dust is
spread at apocentre. Instead we show with theory and by modelling three
different regimes that the morphology and surface brightness distributions of
face-on debris discs are strongly dependent on their eccentricity profile (i.e.
whether this is constant, rising or falling with distance). We demonstrate that
at shorter wavelengths the classical pericentre glow effect remains true,
whereas at longer wavelengths discs can either demonstrate apocentre glow or
pericentre glow. We additionally show that at long wavelengths the same disc
morphology can produce either apocentre glow or pericentre glow depending on
the observational resolution. Finally, we show that the classical approach of
interpreting eccentric debris discs using line densities is only valid under an
extremely limited set of circumstances, which are unlikely to be met as debris

averaging rules can promote many observed group level patterns. Recent studies,
however, suggest that rules simpler than local averaging may be at play in real
organisms; for example, fish stochastically align towards only one randomly
chosen neighbour and yet the schools are highly polarised. Here, we ask -- how
do organisms maintain group cohesion? Using a spatially-explicit model,
inspired from empirical investigations, we show that group cohesion can be
achieved even when organisms randomly choose only one neighbour to interact
with. Cohesion is maintained even in the absence of local averaging that
requires interactions with many neighbours. Furthermore, we show that choosing
a neighbour randomly is a better way to achieve cohesion than interacting with
just its closest neighbour. To understand how cohesion emerges from these
random pairwise interactions, we turn to a graph-theoretic analysis of the
underlying dynamic interaction networks. We find that randomness in choosing a
neighbour gives rise to well-connected networks that essentially cause the
groups to stay cohesive. We compare our findings with the canonical averaging
models (analogous to the Vicsek model). In summary, we argue that randomness in
the choice of interacting neighbours plays a crucial role in collective motion.

pressure-strain are not profoundly affected by an increase of the velocity
defect, although the energy spectra drastically change in the inner layer of
the large defect APG TBL. In the latter, the signature of the inner layer
streaks is absent from the energy spectra. However, the production and
pressure-strain spectra suggest that the near-wall cycle or another energy
transfer mechanism with similar spectral features still exist in large defect
TBLs. In the outer layer, energetic, production and pressure-strain structures
appear to change from wall-attached to wall-detached structures with increasing
velocity defect. Despite this, the 2D spectral distributions have similar
shapes and wavelength aspect ratios of the peaks in all these flows. These
observations suggest that outer layer energy transfer mechanisms may be the
same in wall-bounded flows, no matter if dynamically relevant structures are
attached or detached to the wall. Therefore, the conclusion is that the
mechanisms responsible for turbulence production and inter-component energy

accommodating all types of data and Koopman algorithms. Through a pedagogical
demonstration on a prism wake and the rudimentary Dynamic Mode Decomposition

with mean and rms errors of O-12 and O-9, respectively. The DMD also
approximated the Koopman modes with O-8 error. The LTI reduced the subcritical

excitation-response Koopman modal duplets. The upstream and crosswind walls
constitute a dynamically unified interface dominated by only two mechanisms.
The downstream wall remains a distinct interface and is dominated by four other
mechanisms. The complete revelation of the prism wake essentially comes down to
understanding the six mechanisms, which Part 2 (Li et al., 2022) will address

mass scale ($\Sigma m_{\nu}<0.26 eV$ at $95\%$ C.L.). However, as recently
discussed in the literature, Planck data show anomalies that could affect this
result. Here we provide new constraints on neutrino masses using the recent and
complementary CMB measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR4 and the
South Polar Telescope SPT-3G experiments. We found that both the ACT-DR4 and
SPT-3G data, when combined with WMAP, mildly suggest a neutrino mass with
$\Sigma m_{\nu}=0.68 \pm 0.31$ eV and $\Sigma m_{\nu}=0.46_{-0.36}^{+0.14}$ eV
at $68 \%$ C.L, respectively. Moreover, when CMB lensing from the Planck
experiment is included, the ACT-DR4 data now indicates a neutrino mass above
the two standard deviations, with $\Sigma m_{\nu}=0.60_{-0.50}^{+0.44}$ eV at
$95 \%$, while WMAP+SPT-3G provides a weak upper limit of $\Sigma m_{\nu}<0.37$
eV at $68 \%$ C.L.. Interestingly, these results are consistent with the Planck
CMB+Lensing constraint of $\Sigma m_{\nu} = 0.41_{-0.25}^{+0.17}$ eV at $68 \%$
C.L. when variation in the $A_{\rm lens}$ parameter are considered. We also
show that these indications are still present after the inclusion of BAO or
SN-Ia data in extended cosmologies that are usually considered to solve the
so-called Hubble tension. A combination of ACT-DR4, WMAP, BAO and constraints
on the Hubble constant from the SH0ES collaboration gives $\Sigma
m_{\nu}=0.39^{+0.13}_{-0.25}$ eV at $68 \%$ C.L. in extended cosmologies. We
conclude that a total neutrino mass above the $0.26$ eV limit still provides an
excellent fit to several cosmological data and that future data must be

crucial for decision-making. In order to obtain unbiased ITE estimates, a
common assumption is that all confounders are observed. However, in practice,
it is unlikely that we observe these confounders directly. Instead, we often
observe noisy measurements of true confounders, which can serve as valid
proxies. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating ITE in the
longitudinal setting where we observe noisy proxies instead of true
confounders. To this end, we develop the Deconfounding Temporal Autoencoder, a
novel method that leverages observed noisy proxies to learn a hidden embedding
that reflects the true hidden confounders. In particular, the DTA combines a
long short-term memory autoencoder with a causal regularization penalty that
renders the potential outcomes and treatment assignment conditionally
independent given the learned hidden embedding. Once the hidden embedding is
learned via DTA, state-of-the-art outcome models can be used to control for it
and obtain unbiased estimates of ITE. Using synthetic and real-world medical
data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our DTA by improving over
state-of-the-art benchmarks by a substantial margin.

varying the width of the tracks or the width of the transition region between

high-resolution imaging of faint, distant objects, such as exoplanets. In the
near future, a spacecraft carrying a meter-class telescope with a solar
coronagraph would be placed in the focal region of the SGL. That region begins
at ~547 astronomical units from the Sun and occupies the vicinity of the
target-specific primary optical axis - the line that connects the center of the
target and that of the Sun. This axis undergoes complex motion as the exoplanet
orbits its host star, as that star moves with respect to the Sun, and even as
the Sun itself moves with respect to the solar system's barycenter due to the
gravitational pull of planets in our solar system. An image of an extended
object is projected by the SGL into an image plane and moves within that plane,
responding to the motion of the optical axis. To sample the image, a telescope
must follow the projection with precise knowledge of its own position with
respect to the image. We consider the dominant motions that determine the
position of the focal line as a function of time. We evaluate the needed
navigational capability for the telescope to conduct a multiyear exoplanet
imaging mission. We show that even in a rather conservative case, when an
Earth-like exoplanet is in our stellar neighborhood at $\sim10$ light years,
the motion of the image is characterized by a small total acceleration $\sim
6.1\,\mu {\rm m/s}^2$ that is driven primarily by the orbital motion of the
exoplanet and by the reflex motion of our Sun. We discuss how the amplified
light of the host star allows establishing a local reference frame thus
relaxing navigational requirements. We conclude that the required navigation in
the SGL's focal region, although complex, can be accurately modeled and a $\sim
10$-year imaging mission is achievable with the already available propulsion

in a range of complex control tasks. However, the agent's behavior is usually
difficult to interpret due to the introduction of black-box function, making it
difficult to acquire the trust of users. Although there have been some
interesting interpretation methods for vision-based RL, most of them cannot
uncover temporal causal information, raising questions about their reliability.
To address this problem, we present a temporal-spatial causal interpretation
(TSCI) model to understand the agent's long-term behavior, which is essential
for sequential decision-making. TSCI model builds on the formulation of
temporal causality, which reflects the temporal causal relations between
sequential observations and decisions of RL agent. Then a separate causal
discovery network is employed to identify temporal-spatial causal features,
which are constrained to satisfy the temporal causality. TSCI model is
applicable to recurrent agents and can be used to discover causal features with
high efficiency once trained. The empirical results show that TSCI model can
produce high-resolution and sharp attention masks to highlight task-relevant
temporal-spatial information that constitutes most evidence about how
vision-based RL agents make sequential decisions. In addition, we further
demonstrate that our method is able to provide valuable causal interpretations
for vision-based RL agents from the temporal perspective.

developed the Koopman-LTI architecture and applied it to a pedagogical prism

physical interpretations, providing a phenomenological revelation of the
subcritical prism wake. By the dynamical mode shape, results show that two

associated B\'ernard-K\'arm\'an shedding, and turbulence production, which
together overwhelm the upstream and crosswind walls by instigating a

them a spectrally unified fluid-structure interface. Another four harmonic
counterparts, namely the subharmonic at St7=0.0683, the second harmonic at

downstream wall. The 2P wake mode is also observed as an embedded harmonic of
the bluff-body wake. Finally, this work discovered the vortex breathing

circulation-entrainment-deposition processes. With the Koopman-LTI, one may
pinpoint the exact excitations responsible for a specific structural response,

networks that disentangles data and control planes and brings more flexibility
and efficiency to the network as a result. The Controller Placement (CP)
problem in SDN, which is typically subject to specific optimality criteria, is
one of the primary problems in the design of SDN systems. {\em Dynamic}
Controller Placement (DCP) enables a placement solution that is adaptable to
inherent variability in network components (traffic, locations, etc.). DCP has
gained much attention in recent years, yet despite this, most solutions
proposed in the literature cannot be implemented in real-time, which is a
critical concern especially in UAV/drone based SDN networks where mobility is
high and split second updates are necessary. As current conventional methods
fail to be relevant to such scenarios, in this work we propose a real-time
control placement (RCP) algorithm. Namely, we propose a temporal clustering
algorithm that provides real-time solutions for DCP, based on a control
theoretic framework for which we show the solution exponentially converges to a
near-optimal placement of controller devices. RCP has linear O(n) iteration
computational complexity with respect to the underlying network size, n, i.e.,
the number of nodes, and also leverages the maximum entropy principle from
information theory. This approach results in high quality solutions that are
practically immune from getting stuck in poor local optima, a drawback that
most works in the literature are susceptible to. We compare our work with a
frame-by-frame approach and demonstrate its superiority, both in terms of speed
and incurred cost, via simulations. According to our simulations RCP can be up
to 25 times faster than the conventional frame-by-frame method.

around, interference affects new channels, forcing AFH to deprive itself of new
frequencies, while some other excluded channels are now free of losses but
remain excluded. Channel re-inclusion is a primordial, yet often left out,
aspect of AFH, as it is non-trivial to assess the new situation of excluded
frequencies. We present eAFH, a mechanism for channel exclusion and inclusion.
eAFH introduces informed exploration to AFH: using only past measurements, eAFH
assesses which frequencies we are most likely to benefit from re-including in
the hopping sequence. As a result, eAFH adapts in dynamic scenarios where
interference varies over time. We show that eAFH achieves 98-99.5% link-layer
reliability in the presence of dynamic Wifi interference with 1% control
overhead and 40% higher channel diversity than state-of-the-art approaches.

to achieve spherical powders dates back to 1980s and different attitudes to

atomization, plasma-rotating-electrode atomization, and freefall atomization.
Facilities for employing the aforementioned methods have always been expensive.
This paper proposes two new processes by which pure spherical powder is
achievable with relatively low costs. The first method proposed will deal with
attrition of coarse particles in cryogenic milieu via coinciding jets (i.e.,
cryogenic coinciding jets or CCJ), while the second proposed method concerns
melting and evaporation of metals caused by the heat emitted from a plasma
channel made by the electric field breakdown at micrometer separations of
metallic electrodes (entitled as electrode-plasma-atomization method or EPA).
The CCJ method may face challenges such as cold welding of particles due to
high speed collision and inefficiency of process because of presence of high
plastic deformation and coldworking, whereas the EPA method demands only the
use of electrically conductive materials as electrodes. Titanium powder with
the particle average sizes of 62nm and also 300-400nm was achieved via the EPA
method. Studies also suggest that the CCJ method is expected to produce

the composition of the non-icy component of the moon's surfaces, notably,
sulphuric acid hydrates and magnesium and sodium sulphates. More recently,
magnesium and sodium chlorides have been proposed to explain features observed
in ground-based observations. We have considered four salts (NaCl, Na2SO4,
MgSO4 and MgCl2) with various concentrations, to produce salty ice analogues.
Granular particles were produced by a flash-freezing procedure. Additionally,
compact slabs of salty ices were produced by a slow crystallisation of salty
liquid solution. These two methods mimic the end-members (plumes and slow ice
block formation) for producing hydrated salty ices on the surface of icy moons
such as Europa and Ganymede. We have monitored the near-infrared (NIR)
evolution of our salty ices during sublimation, revealing differences between
the granular particles and the slabs. The slabs formed a higher amount of
hydrates and the most highly hydrated compounds. Granular ices must be formed
from a more concentrated salty solution to increase the amount of hydrates
within the ice particles. The sublimation of salty ices removed all excess
water ice efficiently, but the dehydration of the salts was not observed. The
final spectra of the slabs were most flattened around 1.5 and 2.0 {\mu}m,
especially for the Na2SO4, MgCl2 and MgSO4, suggesting the presence of stable,
highly hydrated compounds. We find that Na2SO4, MgCl2 and MgSO4 are most
compatible with the non-icy component at the surface of the icy moons as
observed by the NIMS instrument on Galileo and by ground-based observations.

and technological systems. We study the annealed ferromagnetic Ising model for
random networks with either independent edges (Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi), or with
prescribed degree distributions (configuration model). Contrary to many
physical models, the annealed setting is poorly understood and behaves quite
differently than the quenched system. In annealed networks with a fluctuating
number of edges, the Ising model changes the degree distribution, an aspect
previously ignored. For random networks with Poissonian degrees, this gives
rise to three distinct annealed critical temperatures depending on the precise
model choice, only one of which reproduces the quenched one. In particular, two
of these annealed critical temperatures are finite even when the quenched one
is infinite, since then the annealed graph creates a giant component for all
sufficiently small temperatures. We see that the critical exponents in the
configuration model with deterministic degrees are the same as the quenched
ones, which are the mean-field exponents if the degree distribution has finite
fourth moment, and power-law-dependent critical exponents otherwise.
Remarkably, the annealing for the configuration model with random i.i.d.
degrees washes away the universality class with power-law critical exponents.

analogous to Onsager's phenomenological equations when the condition of the

these oscillations to damped oscillators in physics (e.g., springs, coupled

Onsager's equations and harmonic Hamiltonian systems are shown to be limiting
cases of a more general formalism.
  The central element of un-damped physical oscillations is the conservation of
entropy which unavoidably results in reversible temperature oscillations. Such
temperature oscillations exist in springs and electrical LC-circuits, but have
among others also been found in the oscillating Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction,
in oscillations of yeast cells, and during the nervous impulse. This suggests
that such oscillations contain reversible entropy-conserving elements, and that

blockchain. Unlike full nodes, light clients are low-capacity devices that want
to validate certain data on a blockchain. They query the data they want from a
full node. If light clients do not verify the data they receive, full nodes
might deceive them. SPV, introduced in the Bitcoin paper, is a practical
solution to this problem currently used in many PoW blockchains. In SPV, the
resources needed to verify a full node's response grow linearly with the
blockchain size, making it inefficient over the long run. Another issue with
SPV is that the full nodes do not get compensated for the services they
provide.
  In this work, we introduce LightSync, a simple and cost-effective solution
for light clients to verify the inclusion of certain data in a PoW blockchain.
The resources needed for running LightSync remain constant no matter what the
size of the blockchain is. LightSync uses an incentive mechanism that
encourages full nodes to participate in the protocol. We perform a thorough

spacecraft trajectory prediction fidelity. To solve the issue, the ""correction

fixed and other parameters are revised by inverting spacecraft orbit data.
However, based on a single spacecraft data, the strategy usually performs
poorly as parameters in drag force calculation are coupled with each other,
which result in convoluted errors. A gravity field recovery and atmospheric
density detection satellite, Q-Sat, developed by xxxxx Lab at xxx University,
is launched on August 6th, 2020. The satellite is designed to be spherical for
a constant drag coefficient regardless of its attitude. An orbit prediction
method for low-earth orbit spacecraft with employment of Q-Sat data is proposed
in present paper for decoupling atmospheric density and drag coefficient
identification. For the first step, by using a dynamic approach-based
inversion, several empirical atmospheric density models are revised based on
Q-Sat orbit data. Depending on the performs, one of the revised atmospheric
density model would be selected for the next step in which the same inversion
is employed for drag coefficient identification for a low-earth orbit operating
spacecraft whose orbit needs to be predicted. Finally, orbit prediction is
conducted by extrapolation with the dynamic parameters in the previous steps.
Tests are carried out with the proposed method by using a GOCE satellite 15-day
continuous orbit data. Compared with legacy ""correction - prediction"" method in
which only GOCE data is employed, the accuracy of the 24-hour orbit prediction
is improved by about 171m the highest for the proposed method. 14-day averaged
24-hour prediction precision is elevated by approximately 70m.

possess the conservation law of energy and preserve entropy on two time layers.
This is achieved by means of specially selected approximations for the equation
of state of a polytropic gas. Also, invariant difference schemes with
additional conservation laws are proposed.
  A new scheme for the case of finite conductivity is tested numerically for
various boundary conditions which shows accurate preservation of difference
conservation laws.

  Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP 2022)",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A cut sparsifier is a reweighted subgraph that maintains the weights of the
cuts of the original graph up to a multiplicative factor of $(1\pm\epsilon)$.
This paper considers computing cut sparsifiers of weighted graphs of size
$O(n\log (n)/\epsilon^2)$. Our algorithm computes such a sparsifier in time
$O(m\cdot\min(\alpha(n)\log(m/n),\log (n)))$, both for graphs with polynomially
bounded and unbounded integer weights, where $\alpha(\cdot)$ is the functional
inverse of Ackermann's function. This improves upon the state of the art by
Bencz\'ur and Karger (SICOMP 2015), which takes $O(m\log^2 (n))$ time. For
unbounded weights, this directly gives the best known result for cut
sparsification. Together with preprocessing by an algorithm of Fung et al.
(SICOMP 2019), this also gives the best known result for polynomially-weighted
graphs. Consequently, this implies the fastest approximate min-cut algorithm,
both for graphs with polynomial and unbounded weights. In particular, we show
that it is possible to adapt the state of the art algorithm of Fung et al. for
unweighted graphs to weighted graphs, by letting the partial maximum spanning
forest (MSF) packing take the place of the Nagamochi-Ibaraki (NI) forest
packing. MSF packings have previously been used by Abraham at al. (FOCS 2016)
in the dynamic setting, and are defined as follows: an $M$-partial MSF packing
of $G$ is a set $\mathcal{F}=\{F_1, \dots, F_M\}$, where $F_i$ is a maximum
spanning forest in $G\setminus \bigcup_{j=1}^{i-1}F_j$. Our method for
computing (a sufficient estimation of) the MSF packing is the bottleneck in the
running time of our sparsification algorithm.

series models that include exogenous covariates in the dynamic. Our main
contribution is to study how a mixing condition on the covariate process
transfers to a mixing condition for the response. Using a coupling method, we
first derive mixing conditions for some Markov chains in random environments,
which gives a first result for some autoregressive categorical processes with
strictly exogenous regressors. Our result is then extended to some infinite
memory categorical processes. In the second part of the paper, we study
autoregressive models for which the covariates are sequentially exogenous.
Using a general random mapping approach on finite sets, we get explicit mixing
conditions that can be checked for many categorical time series found in the
literature, including multinomial autoregressive processes, ordinal time series
and dynamic multiple choice models. We also study some autoregressive count
time series using a somewhat different contraction argument. Our contribution
fill an important gap for such models, presented here under a more general
form, since such a strong mixing condition is often assumed in some recent
works but no general approach is available to check it.

in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using the rapid cadence and high signal-to-noise
ratio light-curves obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project. The feature is
present in most SNe Ia and emerges a few days after the $i$-band maximum. It is
an abrupt change in curvature in the light-curve over a few days and appears as
a flattening in mild cases and a strong downward concave shape, or a ""kink"", in
the most extreme cases. We computed the second derivatives of Gaussian Process
interpolations to study 54 rapid-cadence light-curves. From the second
derivatives we measure: 1) the timing of the feature in days relative to
$i$-band maximum; tdm$_{2}$($i$) and 2) the strength and direction of the
concavity in mag d$^{-2}$ ; dm$_{2}$($i$). 76$\%$ of the SNe Ia show a negative
dm$_{2}$($i$), representing a downward concavity - either a mild flattening or
a strong ""kink"". The tdm$_{2}$($i$) parameter is shown to correlate with the
color-stretch parameter s$_{\mathrm{BV}}$, a SN Ia primary parameter. The
dm$_{2}$($i$) parameter shows no correlation with s$_{\mathrm{BV}}$ and
therefore provides independent information. It is also largely independent of
the spectroscopic and environmental properties. Dividing the sample based on
the strength of the light-curve feature as measured by dm$_{2}$($i$), SNe Ia
with strong features have a Hubble diagram dispersion of 0.107 mag, 0.075 mag
smaller than the group with weak features. Although larger samples should be
obtained to test this result, it potentially offers a new method for improving
SN Ia distance determinations without shifting to more costly near-infrared or
spectroscopic observations.

method, node cloud is used to flexibly discretize the computational domain,
instead of complicated mesh generation. Combining with moving least square
approximation and local Taylor expansion, spatial derivatives of oil-phase
pressure at a node are approximated by generalized difference operators in the
local influence domain of the node. By introducing the first-order upwind
scheme of phase relative permeability, and combining the discrete boundary
conditions, fully-implicit GFDM-based nonlinear discrete equations of the
immiscible two-phase porous flow are obtained and solved by the nonlinear
solver based on the Newton iteration method with the automatic differentiation,
to avoid the additional computational cost and possible computational
instability caused by sequentially coupled scheme. Two numerical examples are
implemented to test the computational performances of the presented method.
Detailed error analysis finds the two sources of the calculation error, roughly
studies the convergence order thus find that the low-order error of GFDM makes
the convergence order of GFDM lower than that of FDM when node spacing is
small, and points out the significant effect of the symmetry or uniformity of
the node collocation in the node influence domain on the accuracy of
generalized difference operators, and the radius of the node influence domain
should be small to achieve high calculation accuracy, which is a significant
difference between the studied hyperbolic two-phase porous flow problem and the
elliptic problems when GFDM is applied.

devices for logic and memory applications. A major hindrance to this is
extrinsic DW pinning at specific sites related to shape and material defects,
which may be present even if the sample synthesis is well controlled.
Understanding the origin of DW pinning and reducing it is especially desirable
in electrochemically-deposited cylindrical magnetic nanowires (NWs), for which
measurements of the fascinating physics predicted by theoretical computation
have been inhibited by significant pinning. We experimentally investigate DW
pinning in Co$_x$Ni$_{100-x}$ NWs, by applying quasistatic magnetic fields.
Wire compositions were varied with $x=20,30,40$, while the microstructure was
changed by annealing or varying the pH of the electrolyte for deposition. We
conclude that pinning due to grain boundaries is the dominant mechanism,
decreasing inversely with both the spontaneous magnetization and grain size.
Second-order effects include inhomogeneities in lattice strain and the residual
magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Surface roughness, dislocations and impurities
are not expected to play a significant role in DW pinning in these wire

new task to help it learn a better model, and (2) maintain the performance of
the models for previous tasks so that they are not forgotten. This paper
proposes a novel capsule network based model called B-CL to address these
issues. B-CL markedly improves the ASC performance on both the new task and the
old tasks via forward and backward knowledge transfer. The effectiveness of
B-CL is demonstrated through extensive experiments.

electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) as a critical
index to evaluate the shielding performance, which is misleading to the
graduates and newcomers embarking on the field of electromagnetic shielding
materials. EMI SE is defined as the sum of three terms including reflection
loss, absorption loss and multiple reflection loss in the classical Schelkunoff
theory, while it is decomposed into two terms named reflection loss and
absorption loss in practice, which is called Calculation theory here. In this
paper, we elucidate the widely-seen misconceptions connected with EMI SE via
theoretical derivation and instance analysis. Firstly, the terms in Calculation
theory are often mistakenly regarded as the approximation of the terms with the
same names in Schelkunoff theory when multiple reflection loss is negligible.
Secondly, it is insufficient and unreasonable to determine the
absorption-dominant shielding performance in the case that absorption loss is
higher than reflection loss since reflection loss and absorption loss cannot
represent the actual levels of reflected and absorbed power. Power coefficients
are recommended to compare the contribution of reflection and absorption to
shielding performance. Thirdly, multiple reflection effect is included in the
definitions of reflection loss and absorption loss in Calculation theory, and
the effect of multiple reflections on shielding property is clarified as
against the commonly wrong understandings. These clarifications offer correct
comprehension about the shielding mechanism and assessment of reflection and
absorption contribution to the total shielding.

involves a mixture of long- and short-term patterns, with dynamic
spatio-temporal dependencies among variables. Existing graph neural networks
(GNN) typically model multivariate relationships with a pre-defined spatial
graph or learned fixed adjacency graph. It limits the application of GNN and
fails to handle the above challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, namely static- and dynamic-graph learning-neural network (SDGL). The
model acquires static and dynamic graph matrices from data to model long- and
short-term patterns respectively. Static matric is developed to capture the
fixed long-term association pattern via node embeddings, and we leverage graph
regularity for controlling the quality of the learned static graph. To capture
dynamic dependencies among variables, we propose dynamic graphs learning method
to generate time-varying matrices based on changing node features and static
node embeddings. And in the method, we integrate the learned static graph
information as inductive bias to construct dynamic graphs and local
spatio-temporal patterns better. Extensive experiments are conducted on two
traffic datasets with extra structural information and four time series
datasets, which show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
almost all datasets. If the paper is accepted, I will open the source code on

than an individual toxicant. Assessing mixtures of chemicals effects on TTP
poses significant statistical challenges, namely (i) TTP being a discrete

  Thermal Shocks in Sintered UO2 Pellets","Submitted to Journal of Nuclear Materials, in review",,"10.1016/j.jnucmat.2022.153719",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Commercial nuclear power plants extensively rely on fission energy from
uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel pellets that provide thermal energy; consequently,
generating carbon-free power in current generation reactors. UO2 fuel incurs
damage and fractures during operation due to large thermal gradients that
develop across the fuel pellet during normal operation. The underlying
mechanisms by which these processes take place are still poorly understood.
This work is a part of our combined experimental and computational effort for
quantifying the UO2 fuel fracture behavior induced by thermal shock. In this
work, we describe an experimental study performed to understand the fuel
fracturing behavior of sintered powder UO2 pellets when exposed to thermal
shock conditions, as well as a multiphysics phase-field fracture model which
accurately predicts the experimental results. Parametric studies and
sensitivity analysis are used to assess uncertainty. Experimental data was
collected from multiple experiments by exposing UO2 pellets to high-temperature
conditions (900-1200C), which are subsequently quenched in sub-zero water. We
exhibit that the fracture results gathered in the experimental setting can be
consistently recreated by this work phase-field fracture model, demonstrating a
reliable ability to our model in simulating the thermal shock gradients and
subsequent fracture mechanics in the primary fuel source for Light-Water
Reactors (LWRs). This model advanced the fundamental understanding of thermal
shock and property correlations to advance utilization of UO2 as a fuel for
nuclear reactors.

often need quick informational help, and meanwhile are often able to offer
help. Let alone professional insights, knowledge common to some is frequently
needed by others. However, rapid advice among strangers is rarely offered in
reality. This signifies a critical issue: the current labor market, called by
this paper the Conventional Market (CM), massively fails such Burst Jobs,
leading to huge job opportunity losses and human intelligence underutilization.
This paper attributes the failure to high transaction costs due to technology
constraints. Thus, this paper proposes creating an online Burst Market (BM)
letting people sell any services at their own rate via video or audio chats
lasting as short as a few seconds or minutes. Empowering all people with
enormous job creation, the BM will aid in poverty lifting, alleviate aging
society problem, reduce AI-led unemployment, maximize human values with
Life-Long Working, and increase prosperity and human achievements. The BM will
also reshape industries, and may cause a global power reshuffle or even the
ultimate destruction of nations. In short, this paper proposes the concept of
the BM and demonstrates that it will provide a major leap for humanity.

is widely used to calculate neutron incoherent inelastic scattering functions
in liquids. However, to overcome a few numerical difficulties, extra physical
approximations are often employed to ease the evaluation.
  In this work, a new numerical method, called convolutional discrete Fourier
transform, is proposed to perform Fourier transform of $\exp[-f(t)]$. We have
applied this method to compute the differential cross sections of light water
up to 10eV. The obtained results, thoroughly benchmarked against experimental
data, showed a much higher dynamic range than conventional fast Fourier
transform. The calculated integral cross sections agree closely with the light
water data in the state-of-the-art nuclear data library. It is in evidence that
this numerical method can be used in the place of the extra physical
approximations.

posts on social networks. Although social network data has numerous semantic
adulterations, and is not intended to be a source of geo-spatial information,
in the text of posts we find pieces of important information about how people
relate to their environment, which can be used to identify interesting aspects
of how human beings interact with portions of land based on their activities.
This research proposes a methodology for the identification of land uses using
Natural Language Processing (NLP) from the contents of the popular social
network Twitter. It will be approached by identifying keywords with linguistic
patterns from the text, and the geographical coordinates associated with the
publication. Context-specific innovations are introduced to deal with data
across South America and, in particular, in the city of Arequipa, Peru. The
objective is to identify the five main land uses: residential, commercial,
institutional-governmental, industrial-offices and unbuilt land. Within the
framework of urban planning and sustainable urban management, the methodology
contributes to the optimization of the identification techniques applied for
the updating of land use cadastres, since the results achieved an accuracy of
about 90%, which motivates its application in the real context. In addition, it
would allow the identification of land use categories at a more detailed level,
in situations such as a complex/mixed distribution building based on the amount
of data collected. Finally, the methodology makes land use information
available in a more up-to-date fashion and, above all, avoids the high economic
cost of the non-automatic production of land use maps for cities, mostly in
developing countries.

a consistent manner. Aside from crafting questions itself, putting together
relevant problems to form a question sheet is also a time-consuming process. In
this work, we present a generic formulation of question assembly and a genetic
algorithm based method that can generate assessment tests from raw
problem-solving history. First, we estimate the learner-question knowledge
matrix (snapshot). Each matrix element stands for the probability that a
learner correctly answers a specific question. We formulate the task as a
combinatorial search over this snapshot. To ensure representative and
discriminative diagnostic tests, questions are selected (1) that has a low root
mean squared error against the whole question pool and (2) high standard
deviation among learner performances. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms greedy and random baseline by a large margin in one
private dataset and four public datasets. We also performed qualitative
analysis on the generated assessment test for 9th graders, which enjoys good
problem scatterness across the whole 9th grader curriculum and decent
difficulty level distribution.

false, based on considerations about objective chance and an old theorem due to
Banach and Kuratowski. More specifically, I argue that the probabilistic
inductive methods standardly used in science presuppose that every proposition
about the outcome of a chancy process has a certain chance between 0 and 1. I
also argue in favour of the standard view that chances are countably additive.
Since it is possible to randomly pick out a point on a continuum, for instance
using a roulette wheel or by flipping a countable infinity of fair coins, it
follows, given the axioms of ZFC, that there are many different cardinalities
between countable infinity and the cardinality of the continuum.

to the field of simulation of quantum systems, in order to mimic more

there is a bridge that allows to simulate a particular quantum system on this

of a possible domestic source can be derived. In particular, the study compares
and evaluates different technologies for lithium extraction from thermal waters
such as liquid-liquid extraction, inorganic sorbents, electrochemical methods,
and membrane technologies in terms of their applicability in geothermal
systems. Based on the technology comparison and the current expansion of
geothermal energy in Germany, different scenarios for the extractable amount of
lithium carbonate from geothermal systems in Germany and the French side of the
Upper Rhine Graben were calculated. Thus, taking into account all currently
active wells, a total extraction capacity of about 4,000 tons of lithium
carbonate per year can be predicted.
