the oscillator versus free particle correspondence to a time-dependent

recently Gibbons [3] pointed out that time redefinition is conveniently studied

conformally flat and have a time-dependent profile, and can then be applied to
the geodesic motion in a plane gravitational wave.

and increasingly used in critical applications. They are also inherently black
box. A number of methods exist to generate image-wise explanations that allow
practitioners to understand and verify model predictions for a given image.
Beyond that, it would be desirable to validate that a DL model
\textit{generally} works in a sensible way, i.e. consistent with domain
knowledge and not relying on undesirable data artefacts. For this purpose, the
model needs to be explained globally. In this work, we focus on image
modalities that are naturally aligned such that each pixel position represents
a similar relative position on the imaged object, as is common in medical
imaging. We propose the pixel-wise aggregation of image-wise explanations as a
simple method to obtain label-wise and overall global explanations. These can
then be used for model validation, knowledge discovery, and as an efficient way
to communicate qualitative conclusions drawn from inspecting image-wise
explanations. We further propose Progressive Erasing Plus Progressive
Restoration (PEPPR) as a method to quantitatively validate that these global
explanations are faithful to how the model makes its predictions. We then apply
these methods to ultra-widefield retinal images, a naturally aligned modality.
We find that the global explanations are consistent with domain knowledge and
faithfully reflect the model's workings.

representation is obtained when combining the symmetric group, $\mathcal{S}_n$,
in the form of permutations of the underlying lattice site ordering, with the
cumulative spin-coupling based on the unitary group, $\mathrm{U}(n)$. In
one-dimensional systems the observed compression of the wave function is
reminiscent of block-spin renormalization group approaches, and allows us to
study larger lattices (here taken up to 80 sites) with the spin-adapted full
configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo method, which benefits from the
sparsity of the Hamiltonian matrix and the corresponding sampled eigenstates
that emerge from the reordering. We find that in an optimal lattice ordering
the configuration state function with highest weight already captures with high
accuracy the spin-spin correlation function of the exact ground state wave
function. This feature is found for more general lattice models, such as the
Hubbard model, and ab initio quantum chemical models, in this work exemplified
by a one-dimensional hydrogen chain. We also provide numerical evidence that
the optimal lattice ordering for the unitary group approach is not generally
equivalent to the optimal ordering obtained for methods based on matrix-product

stars at equilibrium with quark matter cores, as described by the SU(3)
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The hadronic phase is described by a unified
metamodeling approach, with a prior parameter space covering the present
uncertainties on nuclear matter properties with nucleonic degrees of freedom.
The parameter space of the NJL model includes vector-isoscalar and
vector-isovector couplings and, additionally, an effective bag constant for the
quark pressure is introduced as a free parameter. The phase transition is
assumed to be first order with charge neutral phases, following the Maxwell
construction. Our Bayesian framework includes filters on the experimental and
theoretical low-density nuclear physics knowledge (atomic masses, ab initio
calculations of the EoS) and high density constraints from astrophysical
observations (maximum mass of J0348+0432, binary tidal deformability of the
GW170817 event). We find that microscopic vector interactions play an important
role in quark matter in order to stiffen the equation of state sufficiently to
reach high star masses, in agreement with previous studies. Even within a very
large prior for both the hadronic phase and the quark phase and the important
freedom brought by the effective bag constant, our posterior quark cores tend
to be relatively small and only appear in very heavy stars ($M\gtrsim 2
M_\odot$). Coincidentally, the inclusion of the nucleon-quark transition
(deconfinement transition) only weakly affects the radii of compact stars,
foreshadowing a very low observability of a possible phase transition using

realised by acting with Casimirs of $SU(1,1|2)$, and is generically broken by
higher derivative corrections. We point out similar structure underlying

while the $\alpha'^3$ corrections can be written in terms of a sixth order
Casimir acting on a 10d conformal block, similar structure does not appear in

Therefore, we present a high-quality dataset composed of synthetic data and

Additionally, we propose two different methods for 6D bin pose estimation, an
analytical method as the industrial standard and a baseline data-driven method.

methods are trained and evaluated on a relatively small initial dataset which

us to implement glossification by executing a collection of editing actions,
e.g. word addition, deletion, and copying, called editing programs, on their
natural spoken language counterparts. Specifically, we design a new neural
agent that learns to synthesize and execute editing programs, conditioned on
sentence contexts and partial editing results. The agent is trained to imitate
minimal editing programs, while exploring more widely the program space via
policy gradients to optimize sequence-wise transcription quality. Results show
that our approach outperforms previous glossification models by a large margin.

Artificial intelligence is particularly good at recognizing patterns in high
dimensional data, where it usually outperforms humans. Here we applied a simple
ML tool called principal component analysis (PCA) to study data from muon
spectroscopy. The measured quantity from this experiment is an asymmetry
function, which holds the information about the average intrinsic magnetic
field of the sample. A change in the asymmetry function might indicate a phase
transition; however, these changes can be very subtle, and existing methods of
analyzing the data require knowledge about the specific physics of the
material. PCA is an unsupervised ML tool, which means that no assumption about
the input data is required, yet we found that it still can be successfully
applied to asymmetry curves, and the indications of phase transitions can be
recovered. The method was applied to a range of magnetic materials with
different underlying physics. We discovered that performing PCA on all those
materials simultaneously can have a positive effect on the clarity of phase
transition indicators and can also improve the detection of the most important
variations of asymmetry functions. For this joint PCA we introduce a simple way
to track the contributions from different materials for a more meaningful
analysis.

Unlike earlier works, our research focuses on hosts that reside in firewalled
networks (including source address validation -- SAV), which is a very common
scenario nowadays. Our attacks are designed to be non-disruptive -- in the
exfiltration scenario, this makes the attacks stealthier and thus extends their
longevity, and in case of host alias resolution and similar techniques -- this
ensures the techniques are ethical. We focused on ICMP, which is commonly
served by firewalls, and on UDP, which is forecasted to take a more prominent
share of the Internet traffic with the advent of HTTP/3 and QUIC, though we
report results for TCP as well.
  The information leakage scenarios we discovered enable the construction of
practical covert channels which directly pierce firewalls, or indirectly
establish communication via hosts in firewalled networks that also employ SAV.
We describe and test three novel attacks in this context: exfiltration via the
firewall itself, exfiltration via a DMZ host, and exfiltration via co-resident
containers. These are three generic, new use cases for covert channels that
work around firewalling and enable devices that are not allowed direct
communication with the Internet, to still exfiltrate data out of the network.
In other words, we exfiltrate data from isolated networks to the Internet. We
also explain how to mount known attacks such as host alias resolution,
de-NATting and container co-residence detection, using the new information
leakage techniques.

laying out a framework for Autonomous Reinforcement Learning (ARL):
reinforcement learning where the agent not only learns through its own

trials. We introduce a simulated benchmark EARL around this framework,
containing a set of diverse and challenging simulated tasks reflective of the
hurdles introduced to learning when only a minimal reliance on extrinsic

this effect emerges through a condensed state related to the Bogoliubov

problem is always approximable, we prove that this is not the case for FDs. We
show, however, that the class of FDs with a left-hand side chain forms an

following game was introduced by Winkler: An adversary puts a hat on each
player, where each hat has a colour out of $q$ available colours. The players
can see the hat of each of their neighbours in $G$, but not their own hat.
Using a prediscussed guessing strategy, the players then simultaneously guess
the colour of their hat. The players win if at least one of them guesses
correctly, else the adversary wins. The largest integer $q$ such that there is
a winning strategy for the players is denoted by $\text{HG}(G)$, and this is
called the hat guessing number of $G$.
  Although this game has received a lot of attention in the recent years, not
much is known about how the hat guessing number relates to other graph
parameters. For instance, a natural open question is whether the hat guessing
number can be bounded from above in terms of degeneracy. In this paper, we
prove that the hat guessing number of a graph can be bounded from above in
terms of a related notion, which we call strong degeneracy. We further give an
exact characterisation of graphs with bounded strong degeneracy. As a
consequence, we significantly improve the best known upper bound on the hat
guessing number of outerplanar graphs from $2^{125000}$ to $40$, and further
derive upper bounds on the hat guessing number for any class of $K_{2,s}$-free
graphs with bounded expansion, such as the class of $C_4$-free planar graphs,
more generally $K_{2,s}$-free graphs with bounded Hadwiger number or without a

changing orbital period that could be caused by orbital decay, apsidal
precession, or the acceleration of the system towards the Earth. We have
analyzed all data sectors from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
together with all radial velocity (RV) and transit data in the literature to

a possible additional planet in the WASP-4 system, with an orbital period of
~7000 days and $M_{c}sin(i)$ of $5.47^{+0.44}_{-0.43} M_{Jup}$. Additionally,
we find that the transit timing variations of all of the WASP-4b transits
cannot be explained by the second planet but can be explained with either a
decaying orbit or apsidal precession, with a slight preference for orbital
decay. Assuming the decay model is correct, we find an updated period of
1.338231587$\pm$0.000000022 days, a decay rate of -7.33$\pm$0.71 msec/year, and
an orbital decay timescale of 15.77$\pm$1.57 Myr. If the observed decay results
from tidal dissipation, we derive a modified tidal quality factor of
$Q^{'}_{*}$ = 5.1$\pm$0.9$\times10^4$, which is an order of magnitude lower
than values derived for other hot Jupiter systems. However, more observations
are needed to determine conclusively the cause of WASP-4b's changing orbit and

devoted to extend the stochastic block model and its variant, to capture
community structure as the network changes in time. While these models assume
that edge formation depends only on the community memberships, recent work for
static networks show the importance to include additional parameters capturing
structural properties, as reciprocity for instance. Remarkably, these models
are capable of generating more realistic network representations than those
that only consider community membership. To this aim, we present a
probabilistic generative model with hidden variables that integrates
reciprocity and communities as structural information of networks that evolve

of tasks in recent years but making such systems robust against adversarially
chosen modifications of input instances seems to be a much harder problem. It
is probably fair to say that no fully satisfying solution has been found up to
date and it is not clear if the standard formulation even allows for a
principled solution. Hence, rather than following the classical path of bounded
perturbations, we consider a model similar to the quantum PAC-learning model
introduced by Bshouty and Jackson [1995]. Our first key contribution shows that
in this model we can reduce adversarial robustness to the conjunction of two
classical learning theory problems, namely (Problem 1) the problem of finding
generative models and (Problem 2) the problem of devising classifiers that are
robust with respect to distributional shifts. Our second key contribution is
that the considered framework does not rely on specific (and hence also
somewhat arbitrary) threat models like $\ell_p$ bounded perturbations. Instead,
our reduction guarantees that in order to solve the adversarial robustness
problem in our model it suffices to consider a single distance notion, i.e. the
Hellinger distance. From the technical perspective our protocols are heavily
based on the recent advances on delegation of quantum computation, e.g. Mahadev
[2018].
  Although the considered model is quantum and therefore not immediately
applicable to ``real-world'' situations, one might hope that in the future
either one can find a way to embed ``real-world'' problems into a quantum
framework or that classical algorithms can be found that are capable of

unifies different strategies of quantum state discrimination, including
minimum-error and unambiguous discrimination. We first show that maximum
confidence discrimination, as well as unambiguous discrimination, contains
contextual advantages. We then consider a semi-device independent scenario of
certifying maximum confidence measurement. The scenario naturally contains
undetected events, making it a natural setting to explore maximum confidence
measurements. We show that the certified maximum confidence in quantum theory

applied to stochastic rendering techniques, blue noise masks (blue noise
textures) minimize unwanted low-frequency noise in the final image. Current
methods of applying blue noise masks at each frame independently produce white
noise frequency spectra temporally. This white noise results in slower
integration convergence over time and unstable results when filtered
temporally. Unfortunately, achieving temporally stable blue noise distributions
is non-trivial since 3D blue noise does not exhibit the desired 2D blue noise

  We propose novel blue noise patterns that, when animated, produce values at a
pixel that are well distributed over time, converge rapidly for Monte Carlo
integration, and are more stable under TAA, while still retaining spatial blue
noise properties. To do so, we propose an extension to the well-known void and
cluster algorithm that reformulates the underlying energy function to produce
spatiotemporal blue noise masks.
  These masks exhibit blue noise frequency spectra in both the spatial and
temporal domains, resulting in visually pleasing error patterns, rapid
convergence speeds, and increased stability when filtered temporally. We
demonstrate these improvements on a variety of applications, including
dithering, stochastic transparency, ambient occlusion, and volumetric

  By extending spatial blue noise to spatiotemporal blue noise, we overcome the
convergence limitations of prior blue noise works, enabling new applications

solution to the strong CP problem, and possibly account for the observed dark
matter abundance. The QCD axion arises as a composite Nambu-Goldstone boson
(NGB) from the dynamics of a chiral gauge theory with a strongly-interacting
and confining SU(N) factor and a weakly-interacting U(1), with no fundamental
scalar fields. The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is accidental and all the mass
scales are generated dynamically. We analyze specific models where the PQ
symmetry is broken only by operators of dimension 12 or higher. We also
classify several other models where the PQ symmetry can be potentially
protected up to the dimension 15 or 18 level. Our framework can be easily
extended to a scenario where the Standard Model (SM) is unified into a simple
gauge group, and we discuss the case of non-supersymmetric SU(5) unification.
The GUT models predict the existence of additional pseudo NGBs, parametrically
lighter than the GUT and PQ scales, which could have an impact on the
cosmological evolution and leave observable signatures. We also clarify the
selection rules under which higher-dimensional PQ-violating operators can
generate a potential for the axion in the IR, and provide a discussion of the
discrete symmetries in composite axion models associated to the number of
domain walls. These results can be of general interest for composite axion
models based on a QCD-like confining gauge group.

which oil spill characteristics are incorporated to guide oil spill

contour regularisation term and the updated level set regularisation term which
enhance the representational power of the segmentation energy functional.
Benefiting from the synchronisation of SAR image representation and oil spill

image segmentation. However, they require large labeled datasets for this, and
obtaining them is a laborious task that requires clinical expertise.
Semi/self-supervised learning-based approaches address this limitation by
exploiting unlabeled data along with limited annotated data. Recent
self-supervised learning methods use contrastive loss to learn good global
level representations from unlabeled images and achieve high performance in
classification tasks on popular natural image datasets like ImageNet. In
pixel-level prediction tasks such as segmentation, it is crucial to also learn
good local level representations along with global representations to achieve
better accuracy. However, the impact of the existing local contrastive
loss-based methods remains limited for learning good local representations
because similar and dissimilar local regions are defined based on random
augmentations and spatial proximity; not based on the semantic label of local
regions due to lack of large-scale expert annotations in the
semi/self-supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a local contrastive
loss to learn good pixel level features useful for segmentation by exploiting
semantic label information obtained from pseudo-labels of unlabeled images
alongside limited annotated images. In particular, we define the proposed loss
to encourage similar representations for the pixels that have the same
pseudo-label/ label while being dissimilar to the representation of pixels with
different pseudo-label/label in the dataset. We perform pseudo-label based
self-training and train the network by jointly optimizing the proposed
contrastive loss on both labeled and unlabeled sets and segmentation loss on
only the limited labeled set. We evaluated on three public cardiac and prostate
datasets, and obtain high segmentation performance.

  http://imagine.enpc.fr/~darmonf/",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Neural implicit surfaces have become an important technique for multi-view 3D
reconstruction but their accuracy remains limited. In this paper, we argue that
this comes from the difficulty to learn and render high frequency textures with
neural networks. We thus propose to add to the standard neural rendering
optimization a direct photo-consistency term across the different views.
Intuitively, we optimize the implicit geometry so that it warps views on each
other in a consistent way. We demonstrate that two elements are key to the
success of such an approach: (i) warping entire patches, using the predicted
occupancy and normals of the 3D points along each ray, and measuring their
similarity with a robust structural similarity (SSIM); (ii) handling visibility
and occlusion in such a way that incorrect warps are not given too much
importance while encouraging a reconstruction as complete as possible. We
evaluate our approach, dubbed NeuralWarp, on the standard DTU and EPFL
benchmarks and show it outperforms state of the art unsupervised implicit
surfaces reconstructions by over 20% on both datasets.

share a large amount of data with the intended receivers in an insecure

The privacy utility trade-off was facilitated through a privacy funnel based on
mutual information. Nevertheless, it is challenging to characterize the mutual
information accurately with small sample size or unknown distribution
functions. In this article, we propose a privacy funnel based on mutual
information neural estimator (MINE) to optimize the privacy utility trade-off
by estimating mutual information. Instead of computing mutual information in
traditional way, we estimate it using an MINE, which obtains the estimated
mutual information in a trained way, ensuring that the estimation results are
as precise as possible. We employ estimated mutual information as a measure of
privacy and utility, and then form a problem to optimize data utility by
training a neural network while the estimator's privacy discourse is less than
a threshold. The simulation results also demonstrated that the estimated mutual
information from MINE works very well to approximate the mutual information
even with a limited number of samples to quantify privacy leakage and data
utility retention, as well as optimize the privacy utility trade-off.

time-intensive automated image analysis pipelines have been validated for
high-resolution (HiRes) settings. Efficient deep learning approaches, on the
other hand, rarely support more than one fixed resolution (usually 1.0 mm).
Furthermore, the lack of a standard submillimeter resolution as well as limited
availability of diverse HiRes data with sufficient coverage of scanner, age,
diseases, or genetic variance poses additional, unsolved challenges for
training HiRes networks. Incorporating resolution-independence into deep
learning-based segmentation, i.e., the ability to segment images at their
native resolution across a range of different voxel sizes, promises to overcome
these challenges, yet no such approach currently exists. We now fill this gap
by introducing a Voxelsize Independent Neural Network (VINN) for
resolution-independent segmentation tasks and present FastSurferVINN, which (i)
establishes and implements resolution-independence for deep learning as the

(iii) mitigates the data imbalance problem present in HiRes datasets. Overall,
internal resolution-independence mutually benefits both HiRes and 1.0 mm MRI

the ability to react to unexpected situations that are very different from

devises a customized response to the unforeseen situation sequentially, by
selecting actions that minimize the rate of increase of the reconstruction

a data-efficient manner (on the order of 30 data-points) using a modified

  Velocity Estimation Using Signal Response Decomposition",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new method of distortion mitigation for multitarget interferometric angular
velocity estimation in millimeter-wave radar is presented. In general, when
multiple targets are present, the response of a correlation interferometer is
corrupted by intermodulation distortion, making it difficult to estimate
individual target angular velocities. We present a distortion mitigation method
that works by decomposing the responses at each antenna element into the
responses from the individual targets. Data association is performed to match
individual target responses at each antenna such that cross-correlation is
performed only between associated targets. Thus, the intermodulation distortion
(cross-terms) from correlating unlike targets are eliminated, and the result is
a frequency response whose individual frequencies are proportional to the
angular velocities of the targets. We demonstrate the approach with a custom 40
GHz interferometric radar, a high-accuracy motion capture system which provides
ground-truth position measurements, and two robotic platforms. The multitarget
experiments consist of three scenarios, designed to represent easy, medium, and
difficult cases for the distortion mitigation technique. We show that the
reduction in distortion yields angular velocity estimation errors in the three
cases of less than $0.008$ rad/s, $0.020$ rad/s, and $0.033$ rad/s for the
easy, medium, and hard cases, respectively.

identification systems (NISs); but the variegated nature of the trustor

system could be equally trustworthy to all actual and potential trustors. This
worry is accentuated by common theoretical accounts of trustworthiness.
According to such accounts, trustworthiness is relativized to particular
individuals and particular areas of activity, such that one can be trustworthy
with regard to some individuals in respect of certain matters, but not
trustworthy with regard to all trustors in respect of every matter. The present
article challenges this relativistic approach to trustworthiness by outlining a
new account of trustworthiness, dubbed the expectation-oriented account. This
account allows for the possibility of an absolutist (or one-place) approach to
trustworthiness. Such an account, we suggest, is the approach that best
supports the effort to develop NISs. To be trustworthy, we suggest, is to
minimize the error associated with trustor expectations in situations of social
dependency (commonly referred to as trust situations), and to be trustworthy in
an absolute sense is to assign equal value to all expectation-related errors in
all trust situations. In addition to outlining the features of the
expectation-oriented account, we describe some of the implications of this
account for the design, development, and management of trustworthy NISs.

integrals, that has its origin in the negative dimensional integration method.
It was originally proposed for the evaluation of Feynman integrals for which,
when applicable, it gives the results in terms of combinations of (multiple)
series. We focus here on some of the limitations of MoB and address them by
studying the Mellin-Barnes (MB) representation technique. There has been
significant process recently in the study of the latter due to the development
of a new computational approach based on conic hulls (see Phys. Rev. Lett. 127,
151601 (2021)). The comparison between the two methods helps to understand the
limitations of the MoB, in particular when termwise divergent series appear. As
a consequence, the MB technique is found to be superior over MoB for two major
reasons: 1. the selection of the sets of series that form a series
representation for a given integral follows, in the MB approach, from specific
intersections of conic hulls, which, in contrast to MoB, does not need any
convergence analysis of the involved series, and 2. MB can be used to evaluate
resonant (i.e. logarithmic) cases where MoB fails due to the appearance of
termwise divergent series. Furthermore, we show that the recently added Rule 5
of MoB naturally emerges as a consequence of the residue theorem in the context
of MB.

engineering design optimization and parameter estimation, where it is necessary
to invoke the high-fidelity model sequentially, many times. Surrogate models
are usually constructed for individual scalar quantities. However there are
scenarios where a spatially varying field needs to be modeled as a function of
the model's input parameters. We develop a method to do so, using projections
to represent spatial variability while a machine-learned model captures the
dependence of the model's response on the inputs. The method is demonstrated on
modeling the heat flux and pressure on the surface of the HIFiRE-1 geometry in
a Mach 7.16 turbulent flow. The surrogate model is then used to perform
Bayesian estimation of freestream conditions and parameters of the SST (Shear
Stress Transport) turbulence model embedded in the high-fidelity

paper provides the first-ever Bayesian calibration of a turbulence model for

simulations of a two-dimensional droplet between two moving plates are used to
create reference data for different capillary numbers and contact angles. We

calibrated against the drop displacement from MD reference data. It is
demonstrated that the calibrated continuum models can accurately capture
droplet displacement and droplet breakup for different capillary numbers and
contact angles. However, we also observe differences between continuum and
atomistic simulations in describing the transient and unsteady droplet
behavior, in particular, close to dynamical wetting transitions. The molecular
dynamics of the sheared droplet provide insight of the line friction
experienced by the advancing and receding contact lines and evidence of
large-scale temporal ""stick-slip"" like oscillations. The presented results will
serve as a stepping stone towards developing accurate continuum models for
nanoscale hydrodynamics.

paradigm shift in the computer-vision community and is serving as a key-enabler
for a multitude of applications. This technology has offered significant
advantages including reduced power consumption, reduced processing needs, and
communication speed-ups. However, neuromorphic cameras suffer from significant
amounts of measurement noise. This noise deteriorates the performance of
neuromorphic event-based perception and navigation algorithms. In this paper,
we propose a novel noise filtration algorithm to eliminate events which do not
represent real log-intensity variations in the observed scene. We employ a
Graph Neural Network (GNN)-driven transformer algorithm, called
GNN-Transformer, to classify every active event pixel in the raw stream into
real-log intensity variation or noise. Within the GNN, a message-passing
framework, called EventConv, is carried out to reflect the spatiotemporal
correlation among the events, while preserving their asynchronous nature. We
also introduce the Known-object Ground-Truth Labeling (KoGTL) approach for
generating approximate ground truth labels of event streams under various
illumination conditions. KoGTL is used to generate labeled datasets, from
experiments recorded in chalenging lighting conditions. These datasets are used
to train and extensively test our proposed algorithm. When tested on unseen
datasets, the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods by 8.8% in terms
of filtration accuracy. Additional tests are also conducted on publicly
available datasets to demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the
proposed algorithm in the presence of illumination variations and different
motion dynamics. Compared to existing solutions, qualitative results verified
the superior capability of the proposed algorithm to eliminate noise while
preserving meaningful scene events.

paper, we introduce the Exemplar Transformer, a transformer module utilizing a
single instance level attention layer for realtime visual object tracking.
E.T.Track, our visual tracker that incorporates Exemplar Transformer modules,
runs at 47 FPS on a CPU. This is up to 8x faster than other transformer-based
models. When compared to lightweight trackers that can operate in realtime on
standard CPUs, E.T.Track consistently outperforms all other methods on the

little group. In the little-group-covariant massive-spinor formalism, this
notationally amounts to bolding spinor labels. Mass-suppressed contributions to
the contact-term coefficients arise from higher-point contact terms with
additional soft Higgs legs. We apply this procedure to obtain massive
four-point amplitudes featuring scalars, spin 1/2 fermions and vectors, in the
standard-model EFT. The subleading helicity-flipped components of each massive
contact term, which are dictated by little-group covariance, are associated
with the residues of factorizable massless amplitudes. Extra ""frozen"" Higgses
emitted from each leg of a massless contact term supply the additional

the high cost of data annotation. A common approach to this problem is to
assign unlabeled data with pseudo-labels, which are then used as additional
supervision in training. Typically in recent work, the pseudo-labels are
obtained by training a model on the labeled data, and then using confident
predictions from the model to teach itself. In this work, we propose a more
effective pseudo-labeling scheme, called Cross-Model Pseudo-Labeling (CMPL).
Concretely, we introduce a lightweight auxiliary network in addition to the
primary backbone, and ask them to predict pseudo-labels for each other. We
observe that, due to their different structural biases, these two models tend
to learn complementary representations from the same video clips. Each model
can thus benefit from its counterpart by utilizing cross-model predictions as

significant improvement of our framework over existing alternatives. For

low-frequency \textit{total} bandgap in which both transverse and longitudinal

particular selection mechanism that has proved to be reliable is based on the
Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees, commonly referred as UCT. The UCT attempts
to nicely balance exploration and exploitation by considering the values stored

the characteristics of the GCE by first producing a new set of high-resolution
galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission templates, which are ultimately due to
cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium. Using multi-messenger
observations we constrain the properties of the galactic diffuse emission. The
broad properties of the GCE that we find in this work are qualitatively
unchanged despite the introduction of this new set of templates, though its
quantitative features appear mildly different than those obtained in previous
analyses. In particular, we find a high-energy tail at higher significance than
previously reported. This tail is very prominent in the northern hemisphere,
and less so in the southern hemisphere. This strongly affects one prominent
interpretation of the excess: known millisecond pulsars are incapable of
producing this high-energy emission, even in the relatively softer southern
hemisphere, and are therefore disfavored as the sole explanation of the GCE.
The annihilation of dark matter particles of mass $40^{+10}_{-7}$ GeV (95$\%$
CL) to $b$ quarks with a cross-section of $\sigma v = 1.4^{+0.6}_{-0.3} \times
10^{-26}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$ provides a good fit to the excess especially in the
relatively cleaner southern sky. Dark matter of the same mass range
annihilating to $b$ quarks or heavier dark matter particles annihilating to
heavier Standard Model bosons can combine with millisecond pulsars to provide a
good fit to the southern hemisphere emission. As part of this paper, we make
publicly available all of our templates and the data covariance matrix we have
generated to account for systematic uncertainties.[abridged]

the moment when the transiently forming neutron star (NS) collapses to a black
hole (BH), which happens within 350$-$580 ms after bounce in all cases. Because
of high neutrino luminosities and mean energies, neutrino heating leads to
shock revival within $\lesssim$250 ms post bounce in all cases except the
rapidly rotating 60$\mathrm{M}_\odot$ model. In the latter case, centrifugal
effects support a 10% higher NS mass but reduce the radiated neutrino
luminosities and mean energies by $\sim$20% and $\sim$10%, respectively, and
the neutrino-heating rate by roughly a factor of two compared to the
non-rotating counterpart. After BH formation, the neutrino luminosities drop
steeply but continue on a 1$-$2 orders of magnitude lower level for several 100
ms because of aspherical accretion of neutrino and shock-heated matter, before
the ultimately spherical collapse of the outer progenitor shells suppresses the
neutrino emission to negligible values. In all shock-reviving models BH
accretion swallows the entire neutrino-heated matter and the explosion energies
decrease from maxima around 1.5$\times$10$^{51}$erg to zero within a few
seconds latest. Nevertheless, the shock or a sonic pulse moves outward and may
trigger mass loss, which we estimate by long-time simulations with the

generation of turbulence upon which these particles scatter. Such a highly
non-linear problem can be addressed by numerically solving the coupled
differential equations describing the evolution in space and time of the

essentially on the propagation of cosmic rays from supernova remnants in the
warm ionized and warm neutral phases of the interstellar medium and propose an
extended framework to take into account also the effect of energy loss relevant
for cosmic rays of energy below 10 GeV. Interestingly, the diffusion
coefficient of low-energy cosmic rays could be suppressed by up to 2 orders of
magnitude for several tens of kiloyears after the escape from the shock. The
cosmic-ray spectrum outside the supernova remnant flattens below 1 GeV at a
sufficiently late time reminiscient of the spectral behaviour observed by
Voyager. We also find the grammage accumulated around the source to be
non-negligible, with important implications for precision fitting of the

the end of its ~10-yr long accretion outburst. The source is barely detected
during the observation, collecting only six net photons, all below 2 keV.
Assuming that the spectrum is shaped as a neutron star atmosphere model we
perform a statistical analysis to determine a 1-sigma confidence upper range
for the neutron star temperature of ~30-39 eV (for an observer at infinity),
depending on its mass, radius and distance. Given the heat injected into the
neutron star during the accretion outburst, estimated from data provided by
all-sky monitors, the inferred very low temperature suggests that either the
core has a very high heat capacity or undergoes very rapid neutrino cooling.
While the present data do not allow us to disentangle these two possibilities,
both suggest that a significant fraction of the dense core is not
superfluid/superconductor. Our modeling of the thermal evolution of the neutron
star predicts that it may still cool further, down to a temperature of ~15 eV.
Measuring such a low temperature with a future observation may provide

down and eventually join the tail gas, hence providing additional gas to form

the dependence on the weak mixing angle should be incorporated in the
calculation, since its low-energy value is experimentally poorly known. We
first repeat the PREX-II analysis confirming their measurement by fixing the
weak mixing angle to its standard model value. Then, we show the explicit
dependence of the PREX-II measurement on the weak mixing angle, obtaining that
it is fully degenerate with the neutron skin. To break this degeneracy, we
exploit the weak mixing angle measurement from atomic parity violation on lead,
obtaining a slightly thinner neutron skin but with about doubled uncertainties,
possibly easing the PREX tension. Relying on the theoretical prediction,
$\Delta R_{\rm{np}}^{\mathrm{th}}\approx 0.13-0.19\ \mathrm{fm}$, and using it
as a prior in the fit, we find a weak mixing angle value about $1.2\sigma$
smaller than the standard model prediction. Thus, we suggest a possible
solution of the PREX-II tension by showing that, considering its underlying
dependence on the weak mixing angle, the PREX-II neutron skin determination
could be in agreement with the other available measurements and predictions if
the weak mixing angle at the proper energy scale is smaller than the standard

embeddings and simulations of one probabilistic theory by another, show how
this concept subsumes standard notions of contextuality, and prove a multitude

variety of abundance matching and empirically motivated relations. We find: 1)
clear evidence for downsizing in $\sigma_{ap}[M^*,z]$ along the progenitor

called flat if each edge of $G$ belongs to at most two triangles of $G$. In

quantum information science platforms. The operational parameters of these
devices are pushed to the edge of their physical capabilities as the
experiments strive for increasing performance. When the applied radio-frequency
(RF) voltage is increased too much, the devices can experience damaging
electric discharge events known as RF breakdown. We introduce two novel
techniques for in situ detection of RF breakdown, which we implemented while
characterizing the breakdown threshold of surface ion traps produced at Sandia
National Laboratories. In these traps, breakdown did not always occur
immediately after increasing the RF voltage, but often minutes or even hours
later. This result is surprising in the context of the suggested mechanisms for
RF breakdown in vacuum. Additionally, the extent of visible damage caused by
breakdown events increased with applied voltage. To minimize the probability
for damage when RF power is first applied to a device, our results strongly
suggest that the voltage should be ramped up over the course of several hours
and monitored forbreakdown.

attention, including our recent proposal that `normal' SNe Ia from bare
detonations in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf stars are triggered by the passage
of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs): the magnitude step could then
originate from a brightness dependence on stellar properties, on DM properties,
or both. Here, we present a method to estimate the local DM density and
velocity dispersion of the environment of SN Ia progenitors. We find a
luminosity step of $0.52\pm 0.11\,$mag corresponding to bins of high vs low DM
density in a sample of 222 low-redshift events from the Open Supernova Catalog.
We investigate whether the magnitude step can be attributed to local DM
properties alone, assuming asteroid-mass PBHs. Given the inverse correlation
between SN Ia brightness and PBH mass, an intriguing explanation is a
spatially-inhomogeneous PBH mass function. If so, a strong mass segregation in
the DM density-dependent PBH mass scale is needed to explain the magnitude
step. While mass segregation is observed in dense clusters, it is unlikely to
be realized on galactic scales. Therefore, if DM consists of asteroid-mass
PBHs, the magnitude step is more likely to exist, and dominantly to be
attributed to local stellar properties.

spacetime the non-commutativity of translations permits translation without
momentum exchange, just as falling cats and lizards can self-deform to reorient
in flat space without environmental interaction. Translation in curved space
can occur not only in gravitationally induced curved spacetime (where
translation is predicted to be on the order of $10^{-23}$ m per gait cycle) but
also in the curved surfaces encountered by locomotors in real-world
environments. Here we show that a precision robophysical apparatus consisting
of motors driven on curved tracks (and thereby confined to a spherical surface
without a solid substrate) can self-propel without environmental momentum
exchange (impulse) via shape changes that can generate gauge potentials that
manifest as translations. Our system produces shape changes comparable to the
environment's inverse curvatures and generates from zero momentum forward
movement of $10^{-1}$ cm per gait cycle even while resisted by weak
gravitational and frictional forces. Dissipation via friction eventually
arrests the robot but also imbues it with momentum which can be released upon a
cessation of shape changes. This work demonstrates how the interaction between
environmental curvature, active driving and geometric phases yields rich,
exotic phenomena.

merely reporting on a model's bias, or generating explanations using existing
XAI techniques is insufficient to locate and eventually mitigate sources of

causal explanations for bias or unexpected model behavior by identifying
coherent subsets of the training data that are root-causes for this behavior.
Specifically, we introduce the concept of causal responsibility that quantifies
the extent to which intervening on training data by removing or updating
subsets of it can resolve the bias. Building on this concept, we develop an
efficient approach for generating the top-k patterns that explain model bias
that utilizes techniques from the machine learning (ML) community to
approximate causal responsibility and uses pruning rules to manage the large
search space for patterns. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the
effectiveness of Gopher in generating interpretable explanations for
identifying and debugging sources of bias.

a black-box solution without a clear understanding of its true benefits. In
this paper, we comprehensively study three architecture design choices on ViT

demonstrate that a vanilla ViT architecture can fulfill this goal without
handcrafting multiscale features, maintaining the original ViT design
philosophy. We further complete a scaling rule to optimize our model's
trade-off on accuracy and computation cost / model size. By leveraging a
constant feature resolution and hidden size throughout the encoder blocks, we

is achieved here without resorting to an $\boldsymbol{H}({\rm div})$-conforming

error contribution stems from key commutation properties of the underlying DDR

not yet understood, the other is the role played by the proximity to a
ferroelectric instability. In undoped STO, ferroelectric order can in fact be
stabilized by substituting $^{16}$O with its heavier isotope $^{18}$O. Here we
explore the superconducting properties of doped and isotope-substituted
SrTi$(^{18}$O$_{y}^{16}$O$_{1-y})_{3-\delta}$ for $0\le y \le 0.81$ and carrier
concentrations between $6\times 10^{17}$ and $2\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$

$T_c$ as high as 580~mK for $y=0.74$. When approaching SrTi$^{18}$O$_3$ the

  The $k^{\rm th}$ power $G^{(k)}$ of the graph $G$ is obtained from $G$ by
adding an edge between any two vertices of distance at most $k$ from each
other. The $k^{\rm th}$ power of the path $P_n$ on $n$ is an important class of

respectively. In this paper we calculate $\pi_t(P_n^{(k)})$ for all $n$, $k$,

  For a function $D:V(G)\rightarrow{\mathbb N}$, the $D$-pebbling number,

\pi_{|D|}(G)-(s(D)-1)$, where $s(D)$ counts the number of vertices $v$ with
$D(v)>0$. We prove this for trees and $P_n^{(k)}$, for all $n$ and $k$.
  The pebbling exponent $e_\pi(G)$ of a graph $G$ was defined by Pachter, et
al., to be the minimum $k$ for which $\pi(G^{(k)})=n(G^{(k)})$. Of course,
$e_\pi(G)\le {\rm diameter}(G)$, and Czygrinow, Hurlbert, Kierstead, and

thereby reducing the potential friction in its adaptation. This marriage of the

communities of news articles identified by a unique distribution of media

two groups which reflect the dominant ideological polarization in Argentina. We
also found that users form two well differentiated groups identified by their

display a bias towards the two main political parties that rule the political

capabilities to manage the complex relations between their internal components
and to avoid their destructive interactions. Existing communication
technologies commonly implement responsive self-coordination mechanisms that
can be very slow in dynamic situations. The sixth generation (6G) networks,
being in their early stages of research and standardization activities, open
new opportunities to opt for a design-driven approach when developing
self-coordination capabilities. This can be achieved through the use of hybrid
SON designs. A hybrid architecture combines the centralized and distributed
management and control. In this article, we review the history of SONs
including the inherent self-coordination feature. We then delve into the
concept of hybrid SONs (H-SONs), and we summarize the challenges,
opportunities, and future trends for H-SON development. We provide a
comprehensive collection of standardization activities and recommendations,
discussing the key contributions and potential work to continue the evolution
and push for a wide adoption of the H-SON paradigm. More importantly, as a key
6G architectural feature we propose that H-SONs should be loosely coupled
networks. Loose coupling refers to the weak interaction of different layers and
weak interaction between users in the same layer, i.e., the various feedback
loops must be almost isolated from each other to improve the stability and to
avoid chaotic situations. We finally conclude the paper with the key hints
about the future landscape and the key drivers of 6G H-SONs.

and evolve the system for more than 10 orbits in the inspiral regime. We model
the emission as the sum of thermal blackbody radiation emitted by an optically
thick accretion disk and a power-law spectrum extending to hard X-rays emitted
by a hot optically thin corona. We generate time-dependent spectra, images, and
light curves at various frequencies to investigate intrinsic periodic signals
in the emission, as well as the effects of the black hole spin. We find that
prograde black hole spin makes mini-disks brighter since the smaller innermost
stable circular orbit angular momentum demands more dissipation before matter
plunges to the horizon. However, compared to mini-disks in larger separation
binaries with spinning black holes, our mini-disks are less luminous: unlike
those systems, their mass accretion rate is lower than in the circumbinary
disk, and they radiate with lower efficiency because their inflow times are
shorter. Compared to a single black hole system matched in mass and accretion
rate, these binaries have spectra noticeably weaker and softer in the UV.

point that the two approaches can be considered antithetical. The first method
is kinetic energy preserving, meaning that the skew-symmetric discretization of
the convective term is guaranteed not to alter the kinetic energy balance. The
approximated velocity fields exactly satisfy the divergence free constraint and
continuity of the normal component of the velocity is weakly enforced on the
mesh skeleton, leading to H-div conformity. The second scheme relies on Godunov
fluxes for pressure-velocity coupling: a Harten, Lax and van Leer (HLL)
approximated Riemann Solver designed for cell centered formulations is adapted
to hybrid face centered formulations. The resulting numerical scheme is robust
up to the inviscid limit, meaning that it can be applied for seeking
approximate solutions of the incompressible Euler equations. The schemes are
numerically validated performing steady and unsteady two dimensional test cases
and evaluating the convergence rates on h-refined mesh sequences. In addition
to standard benchmark flow problems, specifically conceived test cases are

efficiently deploy DL applications in various systems. The notable finding is
that the solution architects must be aware of the DL application
characteristics, particularly, their pre- and post-processing requirements, to
be able to optimally choose and configure an execution platform, determine the
use of GPU, and decide the efficient scale-up range.

want to understand their role and their structure within that framework.
Inspired by Kirillov's discussion of the symplectic structure on coadjoint
orbits, we provide a similar construction in the case of real Jordan algebras.
Given a real, finite-dimensional, formally real Jordan algebra ${\mathcal{J}}$,
we exploit the generalized distribution determined by the Jordan product on the
dual ${\mathcal{J}}^{*}$ to induce a pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor on the
leaves of the distribution. In particular, these leaves are the orbits of a Lie
group, which is the structure group of ${\mathcal{J}}$, in clear analogy with
what happens for coadjoint orbits. However, this time in contrast with the
Lie-algebraic case, we prove that not all points in ${\mathcal{J}}^{*}$ lie on
a leaf of the canonical Jordan distribution. When the leaves are contained in
the cone of positive linear functionals on ${\mathcal{J}}$, the
pseudo-Riemannian structure becomes Riemannian and, for appropriate choices of
${\mathcal{J}}$, it coincides with the Fisher-Rao metric on non-normalized
probability distributions on a finite sample space, or with the Bures-Helstrom
metric for non-normalized, faithful quantum states of a finite-level quantum
system, thus showing a direct link between the mathematics of Jordan algebras
and both classical and quantum information geometry.

discharge of a charged young magnetar, caused by the short falling timescale of
oppositely charged particles onto the magnetar. In this scenario, curvature
radiation is emitted by particles accelerated at relativistic by the strong
electric fields produced by the disconnection and the subsequent reconnection
of the magnetic field lines, a process triggered by the sudden discharge. We
modeled the magnetars as charged neutron stars in the static approximation
using the exterior metric by the Reissner-Nordstr\""om. We also adopted an
electrical charge distribution proportional to the mass-energy density,
although our results are not strongly sensitive to the specific star charge
distribution, only to the total charge. Our calculations show that the
discharge and emission timescales are several milliseconds, compatible with the
FRB phenomena for magnetars with a total charge of $\sim 10^{20}~\mathrm{C}$
and mass and radius in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and 10 to
45 km, respectively. Furthermore, the calculated total emitted power of a
coherent pulse is $P_{tot}\sim 10^{42-43} erg/s$, and the frequency range and
time scale are also consistent with FRBs astronomical observations. Finally, if
the magnetar does not collapse after the discharge, the existence of FRB
repeater sources can not rule out the existence of a blast repetition after the
time needed to magnetosphere recharges and produce a new discharge.

sensitive attributes like gender, skintone etc. For gender and skintone, we
observe that the regions of the face that a network attends to vary by the
category of an attribute. This might contribute to bias. Building on this
intuition, we propose a novel distillation-based approach called Distill and
De-bias (D&D) to enforce a network to attend to similar face regions,
irrespective of the attribute category. In D&D, we train a teacher network on
images from one category of an attribute; e.g. light skintone. Then distilling
information from the teacher, we train a student network on images of the
remaining category; e.g., dark skintone. A feature-level distillation loss
constrains the student network to generate teacher-like representations. This
allows the student network to attend to similar face regions for all attribute
categories and enables it to reduce bias. We also propose a second distillation
step on top of D&D, called D&D++. Here, we distill the `un-biasedness' of the
D&D network into a new student network, the D&D++ network, while training this
new network on all attribute categories; e.g., both light and dark skintones.
This helps us train a network that is less biased for an attribute, while
obtaining higher face verification performance than D&D. We show that D&D++
outperforms existing baselines in reducing gender and skintone bias on the
IJB-C dataset, while obtaining higher face verification performance than
existing adversarial de-biasing methods. We evaluate the effectiveness of our

including similarities between $p$-Pb and Pb-Pb spectra. In order to verify or
falsify such claims it is essential that PID spectra for $p$-Pb collisions (as
a control experiment) be understood in terms of fundamental QCD principles.
This article (Part I of a two-part report) presents application of a

proton detection inefficiency) are resolved. Coefficients for TCM model
functions previously assumed independent of $p$-Pb centrality are obtained
directly from spectra. Jet-related spectrum hard components are precisely
isolated and their shape evolution with centrality determined relative to a
fixed TCM as reference. In Part II the TCM is further elaborated to describe
varying spectrum hard components (and therefore entire spectra) within data
statistical uncertainties. The completed PID TCM is then used to investigate
properties of spectrum and yield ratios (e.g. $p/\pi$) and $\bar p_t$ data.

While recent supervised machine learning methods offer solutions to incident

often too high to be used in practice. Specifically, the inconsistency in the
human labeling of the incidents significantly affects the performance of
supervised learning models. To that end, we focus on a data-centric approach to
improve the accuracy and reduce the false alarm rate of traffic incident
detection on highways. We develop a weak supervised learning workflow to
generate high-quality training labels for the incident data without the ground
truth labels, and we use those generated labels in the supervised learning
setup for final detection. This approach comprises three stages. First, we
introduce a data preprocessing and curation pipeline that processes traffic
sensor data to generate high-quality training data through leveraging labeling
functions, which can be domain knowledge-related or simple heuristic rules.
Second, we evaluate the training data generated by weak supervision using three
supervised learning models -- random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and a support
vector machine ensemble -- and long short-term memory classifiers. The results
show that the accuracy of all of the models improves significantly after using
the training data generated by weak supervision. Third, we develop an online
real-time incident detection approach that leverages the model ensemble and the
uncertainty quantification while detecting incidents. Overall, we show that our
proposed weak supervised learning workflow achieves a high incident detection

Two main challenges in designing straggler-resilient algorithms for CMC are the
need to estimate the statistics of the workers' outputs across multiple shots,

polynomials, which allows, in the $q$-Whittaker limit, for a unified
description of the quantum Q-system variables and the conserved quantities as
limits of the time-evolved Macdonald operators and the Pieri operators,
respectively. The latter are identified with relativistic $q$-difference Toda
Hamiltonians. A crucial ingredient in the proof is the use of the ""Fourier
transformed"" picture, in which we compute time-translation operators and prove
that they commute with the Pieri operators or Hamiltonians. We also discuss the
universal solutions of Koornwinder-Macdonald eigenvalue and Pieri equations,
for which we prove a duality relation, which simplifies the proofs further.

settings where the test distribution is different from the training data. In
this paper, we focus on the challenging problem of multi-source zero shot DG
(MDG), where labeled training data from multiple source domains is available
but with no access to data from the target domain. A wide range of solutions
have been proposed for this problem, including the state-of-the-art
multi-domain ensembling approaches. Despite these advances, the na\""ive ERM
solution of pooling all source data together and training a single classifier
is surprisingly effective on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we hypothesize
that, it is important to elucidate the link between pre-specified domain labels
and MDG performance, in order to explain this behavior. More specifically, we
consider two popular classes of MDG algorithms -- distributional robust
optimization (DRO) and multi-domain ensembles, in order to demonstrate how
inferring custom domain groups can lead to consistent improvements over the
original domain labels that come with the dataset. To this end, we propose (i)
Group-DRO++, which incorporates an explicit clustering step to identify custom
domains in an existing DRO technique; and (ii) DReaME, which produces effective
multi-domain ensembles through implicit domain re-labeling with a novel
meta-optimization algorithm. Using empirical studies on multiple standard
benchmarks, we show that our variants consistently outperform ERM by
significant margins (1.5% - 9%), and produce state-of-the-art MDG performance.

graph of an infinite finitely generated group. This is a collection of infinite
simple paths bringing all vertices to infinity. We impose a restriction that
every edge can be used a uniformly bounded number of times in this scheme. An
easy observation shows that existing of such a scheme is equivalent to
non-amenability of the group. A special case happens if every edge can be used
only once. These scheme are called pure. We obtain a criterion for existing of
such a scheme in terms of isoperimetric constant of the graph. We analyze
R.\,Thompson's group $F$, for which the amenability property is a famous open
problem. We show that pure evacuation schemes do not exist for the set of
generators $\{x_0,x_1,\bar{x}_1\}$, where $\bar{x}_1=x_1x_0^{-1}$. However, the
question becomes open if edges with labels $x_0^{\pm1}$ can be used twice.
Existing of pure evacuation scheme for this version is implied by some natural
conjectures.

interpretability and prediction performance. On the one hand, traditional
models are often interpretable to humans but they cannot achieve high
prediction performances. At the opposite end of the spectrum, deep models can
achieve state-of-the-art performances in many tasks. However, deep models'
predictions are known to be uninterpretable to humans. In this paper we present
a framework that shortens the gap between the two aforementioned groups of
methods. Given an artificial neural network (ANN), our method finds a Gaussian
process (GP) whose predictions almost match those of the ANN. As GPs are highly
interpretable, we use the trained GP to explain the ANN's decisions. We use our
method to explain ANNs' decisions on may datasets. The explanations provide
intriguing insights about the ANNs' decisions. With the best of our knowledge,
our inference formulation for GPs is the first one in which an ANN and a
similarly behaving Gaussian process naturally appear. Furthermore, we examine
some of the known theoretical conditions under which an ANN is interpretable by
GPs. Some of those theoretical conditions are too restrictive for modern
architectures. However, we hypothesize that only a subset of those theoretical
conditions are sufficient. Finally, we implement our framework as a publicly
available tool called GPEX. Given any pytorch feed-forward module, GPEX allows
users to interpret any ANN subcomponent of the module effortlessly and without
having to be involved in the inference algorithm. GPEX is publicly available

from the cloud to resource-limited edge devices. Unfortunately, current deep
networks remain not only too compute-heavy for inference and training on edge

bandwidth-constrained networks. In this paper, we develop, implement, and
experimentally validate a novel FL framework termed Federated Dynamic Sparse
Training (FedDST) by which complex neural networks can be deployed and trained
with substantially improved efficiency in both on-device computation and
in-network communication. At the core of FedDST is a dynamic process that
extracts and trains sparse sub-networks from the target full network. With this
scheme, ""two birds are killed with one stone:"" instead of full models, each
client performs efficient training of its own sparse networks, and only sparse
networks are transmitted between devices and the cloud. Furthermore, our
results reveal that the dynamic sparsity during FL training more flexibly
accommodates local heterogeneity in FL agents than the fixed, shared sparse
masks. Moreover, dynamic sparsity naturally introduces an ""in-time
self-ensembling effect"" into the training dynamics and improves the FL
performance even over dense training. In a realistic and challenging non i.i.d.
FL setting, FedDST consistently outperforms competing algorithms in our
experiments: for instance, at any fixed upload data cap on non-iid CIFAR-10, it
gains an impressive accuracy advantage of 10% over FedAvgM when given the same

cutting-edge works adopting individual chance constraints to manage
uncertainties, this paper controls the violation probability of all critical
constraints with joint chance constraints (JCCs). This joint manner can
explicitly guarantee the operational security of the entire system based on
operators' preferences. To overcome the intractability of JCCs, we first prove
that JCCs can be safely approximated by robust constraints with proper
uncertainty sets. A famous machine learning algorithm, one-class support vector
clustering, is then introduced to construct a small enough polyhedron
uncertainty set for these robust constraints. A linear robust counterpart is
further developed based on the strong duality to ensure computational
efficiency. Numerical results based on various distributed uncertainties
confirm the advantages of the proposed method in optimality and feasibility.

re-production in different serving sizes. To demonstrate the benefits of the
pipeline, the model can be used for meal kits generation. To evaluate the
pipeline, the large scale dataset Recipe1M is used. Prior to experiments, the
Recipe1M dataset is parsed and explicitly annotated with portions of
ingredients. Experiments show that using ingredients and their portions
significantly improves calorie estimation. Also, a visual interface is created
in which a user can interact with the pipeline to reach accurate calorie
estimations and generate a meal kit for cooking purposes.

Learning how to sample neighbors is non-trivial, since the neighbor indices in

heterogeneous policy impacts, and allows them to self-select into treatment. In
this paper, we propose a new approach that mixes paternalistic assignment and

Exploiting random variation generated by the field experiment, we develop a

the estimated assignment policy optimally allocates individuals to be treated,

(i) large space exploration of model sizes, and (ii) prohibitively long

its hierarchy, which is the set of auxiliary elements introduced to capture the

precision move beyond the regime that can be currently handled. This article
presents a new representation of HEOM theory in which the hierarchy is mapped
into a continuous space of a collective bath coordinate and several auxiliary

opposite signs of trilinear NH coefficients associated with $\mu$ and $e$

applications on an industrial scale requires scalable and mass-producible
plasmonic cavities that provide ease of access and control for quantum

nanoantenna, we propose a novel design strategy for multidimensional
engineering of nanocavity antenna-mode hotspots, which facilitates their
elevation to the top of the nanobowtie gap and provides a field enhancement of
~500 fold (a 1.6-fold increase compared to a conventional nanobowtie-on-glass
cavity at the bottom of the nanobowtie gap). We discuss the formation mechanism
for such antenna modes using different material substrates from the perspective
of charge carrier motion, and analyze their sensitivity to the geometrical
parameters of the device. The advantages of these antenna modes, particularly
in view of their dominantly in-plane polarized near-fields, are further
elaborated in a spatiotemporal study of plexcitonic strong coupling involving
single emitters and layered ensembles thereof, which reveals ultrafast quantum
dynamics dependent on both the substrate and nanobowtie geometry, as well as
the potential for applications related to 2D materials whose excitonic dipoles
are typically oriented in-plane. The conceptual discovery of this
substrate-enabled antenna-mode nanoengineering could readily be extended to
tailor hotspots in other plasmonic platforms, and we anticipate that this work
could inspire a wide range of novel research directions from photoluminescence

coordinate representation. In contrast to conventional recognitions that the
photoelectron holography is the interference of two branches of electron
trajectories, however, we find strikingly that infinite semiclassical

into the same final momentum: The initial momenta are found to be distributed
on a ring-shape curve in the transverse momentum plane and the initial
positions of these trajectories are perpendicular to their initial momentum
vectors. For the zero final transverse momentum, the above ring-source
trajectories degenerate into the point-source axial caustic trajectories (or
Glory trajectories) and the quantum interference of these trajectories will
dramatically alter the scattering amplitudes that is termed as Glory

validation basis of a multi-domain Lagrangian-Eulerian hybrid flow solver. In
this hybrid combination, separate grids of limited width are defined around
every solid body, on which the Eulerian flow equations are solved using finite
volume approximations. In order to interconnect the domains defined by the
grids, the entire flow is described in Lagrangian coordinates and the
corresponding equations are solved via particle approximations in fully coupled
mode with the solutions within the Eulerian grids. The flow solver is also
strongly (implicitly) coupled with the structural dynamic equations in case the
cylinders are elastically supported. In the present work, the Eulerian part
solves the compressible flow equations in density-velocity-pressure formulation
and uses pre-conditioning at low Ma while the Lagrangian part is based on the
density-dilatation-vorticity-pressure formulation. The hybrid solver is first
validated in the case of an isolated rigid cylinder at $Re=100$. Then the case
of a single elastically mounted cylinder at $Re=200$ is considered, followed by
the case of two cylinders in tandem arrangement that are either rigid or
elastically mounted. Good agreement with results produced with spectral and
immersed boundary methods is found indicating the capabilities of the hybrid
predictions. Also the flexibility of the method in handling complex multi-body
fluid structure interaction problems is demonstrated by allowing

The super-operator equations for the electromagnetic (EM) field operators are
formulated for the problems of quantum antenna emission and quantum light
scat-tering by a dielectric body. The general solution of super-operator
equation is presented in terms of the classical resolvent. In contrast to the
classical case, it includes the ancillary components associated with the
quantum noise even in the absence of absorption. The reason for it lies in the
energy exchange between different spatial regions with various bases for the
field presentation (it looks like losses or gain from the point of view of the
correspondent region). A number of examples (two-element dipole antenna, plane
dielectric layer, and dielectric cylinder with circular cross section) which
demonstrate the physical mechanism of the appearance of noise are considered.
It is shown, that antenna emission or scattering transforms the coherent
properties of quantum light. This opens a new way of controlling the coherence

transformation for the target basis functions to a gliding basis is presented,
which is time-periodic but does not displace in space with respect to the
projectile, allowing a local-basis Floquet impurity-scattering formalism to be

the formalism. The time-dependent non-orthogonality of the gliding basis
requires care in the proper (simplest) definition of a local projectile

least, a non degenerate quality of the mesh during the refinement iterations; a
bound of the number of unknowns of the discrete problem with respect to the

ions has been widely explored as a proficient approach to improve its ethanol
sensing properties, while anionic dopants have been rarely considered. Here in
we demonstrate the effect of nitrogen doping on the ethanol sensing
characteristics of ZnO thin films. Nitrogen doped ZnO (N-ZnO) thin films have
been synthesized following sol-gel technique with urea as nitrogen precursor.
Ethanol sensing characteristics of the N-ZnO thin film has been com-pared with
pure ZnO sensor over a wide range of temperature and relative humidity
conditions. The N-ZnO sensor exhibits significantly large ethanol sensing
response at a lower operating temperature (~99 % at 225 {\deg}C vs ~81 % at 250
{\deg}C for ZnO), faster response time (12 s vs 33 s for ZnO), long term
stability, improved resilience against humidity and selectivity towards ethanol
over methanol and acetone. The experimental observations have been supplemented
by estimating the adsorption energies of ethanol on ZnO and N-ZnO surface using
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discuss that the microscopic
origin of improved ethanol sensing of N-ZnO is related to the facile adsorption
of ethanol molecules on the oxide surface which is promoted by modification of
electronic properties of ZnO by the nitrogen dopant atoms.

a regularization model into a cascade network by replacing the first-order
information (i.e., (sub)gradient or proximal operator) of the regularizer with
a network module, which appears more explainable and predictable compared to
common data-driven networks. Conversely, in theory, there is not necessarily
such a functional regularizer whose first-order information matches the
replaced network module, which means the network output may not be covered by
the original regularization model. Moreover, up to now, there is also no theory
to guarantee the global convergence and robustness (regularity) of unrolled
networks under realistic assumptions. To bridge this gap, this paper propose to
present a safeguarded methodology on network unrolling. Specifically, focusing
on accelerated MRI, we unroll a zeroth-order algorithm, of which the network
module represents the regularizer itself, so that the network output can be
still covered by the regularization model. Furthermore, inspired by the ideal
of deep equilibrium models, before backpropagating, we carry out the unrolled
iterative network to converge to a fixed point to ensure the convergence. In
case the measurement data contains noise, we prove that the proposed network is
robust against noisy interference. Finally, numerical experiments show that the
proposed network consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art MRI
reconstruction methods including traditional regularization methods and other

there is increasing attention to developing explanation models (explainers) of
GNNs for improved transparency in clinical decisions.
  Existing explainers discover an explanatory subgraph relevant to the
prediction.
  However, such a subgraph is insufficient to reveal all the critical
biological substructures for the prediction because the prediction will remain
unchanged after removing that subgraph.
  Hence, an explanatory subgraph should be not only necessary for prediction,
but also sufficient to uncover the most predictive regions for the explanation.
  Such explanation requires a measurement of information transferred from
different input subgraphs to the predictive output, which we define as
information flow.
  In this work, we address these key challenges and propose IFEXPLAINER, which
generates a necessary and sufficient explanation for GNNs.
  To evaluate the information flow within GNN's prediction, we first propose a
novel notion of predictiveness, named $f$-information, which is directional and
incorporates the realistic capacity of the GNN model.
  Based on it, IFEXPLAINER generates the explanatory subgraph with maximal
information flow to the prediction.
  Meanwhile, it minimizes the information flow from the input to the predictive
result after removing the explanation.
  Thus, the produced explanation is necessarily important to the prediction and
sufficient to reveal the most crucial substructures.
  We evaluate IFEXPLAINER to interpret GNN's predictions on breast cancer
subtyping.

that is most informative to the graph property. It can be formulated by
optimizing Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) with a mutual information
estimator. However, GIB suffers from training instability and degenerated
results due to its intrinsic optimization process. To tackle these issues, we
reformulate the subgraph recognition problem into two steps: graph perturbation
and subgraph selection, leading to a novel Variational Graph Information
Bottleneck (VGIB) framework. VGIB first employs the noise injection to modulate
the information flow from the input graph to the perturbed graph. Then, the
perturbed graph is encouraged to be informative to the graph property. VGIB
further obtains the desired subgraph by filtering out the noise in the
perturbed graph. With the customized noise prior for each input, the VGIB
objective is endowed with a tractable variational upper bound, leading to a
superior empirical performance as well as theoretical properties. Extensive
experiments on graph interpretation, explainability of Graph Neural Networks,

Herein we present a computationally-efficient model to characterize the
interaction between a fully Rydberg-blockaded ensemble of $N$ $\Lambda$-type
three-level atoms and a strong probe light field in a coherent state. The model
enables us to achieve a decomposition of the coupled dynamics in the strong
field limit, which significantly reduces the complexity of computing the
$N$-body system evolution and paves a way for practical analysis in
experiments. A quasi-steady-state power spectrum with multiple sidebands is
found in the scattered field. The relative heights of the sidebands show a time
dependence determined by the atomic relaxation, which illuminates potential
applications of using the system in information transfer of quantum networks.
With negligible dissipative flipping to the unsymmetrical states, the atomic
relaxation time indicating a linearly increasing pooling state fraction is
derived analytically as a function of the atom number.

segmenting 3D building instances even if they are attached and embedded in a

to RGBH images by adding a heightmap and are segmented to obtain all roof

Our mask clustering accounts for spatial occlusion and overlapping, which can
eliminate segmentation ambiguities among multi-view images. Based on these
global masks, 3D roof instances are segmented out by mask back-projections and
extended to the entire building instances through a Markov random field
optimization. A new dataset that contains instance-level annotation for both 3D

best of our knowledge, it is the first outdoor dataset dedicated to 3D instance

The proposed end-to-end model utilizes a multi-objective loss function to
jointly reconstruct FC networks and learn discriminative graph representations
of the SC-to-FC mapping for downstream subject (i.e., graph-level)
classification. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the learnt

We show that the distillation guarantees the semantic features of the two

the unknown class. Therefore, we leverage the semantic feature discrepancy
between the two branches to discover the anomalies. DiCNet abandons the
semantic classification head in the inference process, and hence significantly
alleviates the issue caused by incorrect semantic classification. Extensive

move through multidimensional filter volumes. It is shown that these

to 1D filtering, particularly at large filter widths. Analytical results for
the filtered quantities are achieved by approximating density times progress

from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of statistically planar turbulent

parameters is used to develop and validate the model. Two wrinkling factor
models as function of filter width and subgrid turbulence level are proposed.
For small filter widths up to two times the laminar flame thickness, minor
effects from subgrid flame folding are observed. For larger filters, the
filtered reaction source term rises linearly with filter width at a rate which
increases with subgrid turbulence level. The modelled reaction source term as

agreement with filtered DNS data for all investigated free stream turbulence

agent runs a (small) network with a crafted structure and dynamics to form a
network of networks (i.e., the connection between the newly created networks
and their interconnections respecting the initial network connections).
Together with a re-weighting of the dynamic parameters dictating the
inter-agent dynamics and the initial states, we show that it is possible to
ensure that the value of each node converges to the consensus value of the
original network. Furthermore, we show that, under mild assumptions, it is
possible to craft the dynamics such that the design can be achieved in a
distributed fashion. Finally, we illustrate the proposed algorithm with

induced extreme storms and their effects on respective FD profiles. We observed
the sudden storm commencement of the GS coincides with the FD onset.
Interestingly, we also noted a gradual increase in neutron counts during the
main and recovery phases of GS. The maximum enhancement in neutron counts
coincides with the minimum value of the Sym-H index. The enhancement is visible
primarily in all the neutron monitors but significantly pronounced in
high-energy neutrons compared to low-energy neutrons. The weakening of Earth's
magnetic shield due to ICME-Magnetosphere interaction allows more cosmic rays
to reach the ground. Thus, we conclude that the geomagnetic storm conditions
highly influence the FD profile along with the external causing agent.
Therefore, it is essential to include the effect of geomagnetic field variation
in the models that are used to reproduce the FD profile.

the cluster sizes, their mass and concentration. The simulation results allow
us to distinguish three stages of the spinodal decomposition: early,

characteristic of the usual diffusion mass transfer; the change in the average
cluster size can be represented by a scaling function with an exponent close to

shown that the concentration of clusters at the final stage is determined by
the temperature dependence of the interfacial energy.

encoder, and refined using a graph-based attention network. This attention
network exploits geometrical relationships between key points to improve the
matching in point clouds with low overlap. At inference time, the relative pose
transformation is obtained by robustly fitting the correspondences through
sample consensus. The evaluation is performed on the KITTI dataset and a novel
synthetic dataset including low-overlapping point clouds with displacements of
up to 30m. The proposed method achieves on-par performance with
state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset, and outperforms existing methods

However, for this task, a model needs not only capture the important words in

While inducing large economic losses, the epidemiological consequences of such
travel restrictions are highly uncertain. They may be poorly effective when the
new highly transmissible strain of the virus already circulates in many
regions. Assessing the effectiveness of travel bans is difficult given the
paucity of data on daily cross-border mobility and on existing variant
circulation. The question is topical and timely as the new omicron variant --
classified as a variant of concern by WHO -- has been detected in Southern
Africa, and perceived as (potentially) more contagious than previous strains.

scenario of aligning sparsely and differently sampled observations in the
presence of noise is still lacking. We approach registration in this scenario
with a fusion of the closed-form Universal Mani-fold Embedding (UME) method and
a deep neural network. The two are combined into a single unified framework,
named DeepUME, trained end-to-end and in an unsupervised manner. To
successfully provide a global solution in the presence of large
transformations, we employ an SO(3)-invariant coordinate system to learn both a
joint-resampling strategy of the point clouds and SO(3)-invariant features.
These features are then utilized by the geometric UME method for transformation
estimation. The parameters of DeepUME are optimized using a metric designed to
overcome an ambiguity problem emerging in the registration of symmetric shapes,
when noisy scenarios are considered. We show that our hybrid method outperforms
state-of-the-art registration methods in various scenarios, and generalizes
well to unseen data sets. Our code is publicly available.

Therefore, it is crucial to extract structured representations of events from
social streams. Generally, existing event extraction research utilizes pattern
matching, machine learning, or deep learning methods to perform event
extraction tasks. However, the performance of Chinese event extraction is not
as good as English due to the unique characteristics of the Chinese language.
In this paper, we propose an integrated framework to perform Chinese event
extraction. The proposed approach is a multiple channel input neural framework
that integrates semantic features and syntactic features. The semantic features
are captured by BERT architecture. The Part of Speech (POS) features and
Dependency Parsing (DP) features are captured by profiling embeddings and Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN), respectively. We also evaluate our model on a
real-world dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms the benchmark approaches significantly.

However, when the field is directed along the axis of spontaneous sublattice

buoyancy-driven convection flow within a fluid layer experiencing an unstable
salinity gradient and a stable thermal gradient. Especially, we investigate the
influences from a background shear with uniform strength. Linear stability
analysis indicates that the unstable modes shift from a circular shape to a
sheet-like shape as the shear becomes stronger. Three dimensional direction
numerical simulations are conducted for five groups of cases, each of which has
the same combination of thermal and salinity gradients (measured by
corresponding Rayleigh numbers), and gradually increasing shear strength.
Simulation results reveal that a very weak shear organizes the salt fingers
into a very regular pattern, which can enhance the salinity flux. This
enhancement effect, however, reduces as the Rayleigh number increases. As the
shear further strengthens, the dominant structures change from salt fingers to
salt sheets, and the coherence length scale increases in the streamwise
direction. Meanwhile, salinity and heat fluxes decrease. These results suggest
that even a weak shear can notably alter the morphology and transport
properties of fingering double diffusive convection.

at $\pm$ 0.8 \AA, $\pm$ 0.4 \AA and line center of He I 10830. At the flare
ribbon's leading edge the line is observed to undergo enhanced absorption,
while the rest of the ribbon is observed to be in emission. When in emission,
the contrast compared to the pre-flare ranges from about $30~\%$ to nearly
$100~\%$ at different spectral positions. Two types of spectra, ""convex"" shape
with higher intensity at line core and ""concave"" shape with higher emission in
the line wings, are found at the trailing and peak flaring areas, respectively.
On the ribbon front, negative contrasts, or enhanced absorption, of about $\sim
10\% - 20\%$ appear in all five wavelengths. This observation strongly suggests
that the negative flares observed in He I 10830 with mono-filtergram previously
were not caused by pure Doppler shifts of this spectral line. Instead, the
enhanced absorption appears to be a consequence of flare energy injection,
namely non-thermal collisional ionization of helium caused by the precipitation
of high energy electrons, as found in our recent numerical modeling results. In
addition, though not strictly simultaneous, observations of Mg II from the IRIS
spacecraft, show an obvious central reversal pattern at the locations where
enhanced absorption of He I 10830 is seen, which is in consistent with previous
observations.

accuracy. In this work, we research how to increase the generalization
capability with an emerging graph deep learning method -- Graph Neural Network
(GNN). First, IP geolocation is re-formulated as an attributed graph node
regression problem. Then, we propose a GNN-based IP geolocation framework named
GNN-Geo. GNN-Geo consists of a preprocessor, an encoder, messaging passing (MP)
layers and a decoder. The preprocessor and encoder transform measurement data
into the initial node embeddings. MP layers refine the initial node embeddings
by modeling the connection information. The decoder maps the refined embeddings
to nodes' locations and relieves the convergence problem by considering prior
knowledge. The experiments in 8 real-world IPv4/IPv6 networks in North America,
Europe and Asia show the proposed GNN-Geo clearly outperforms the state-of-art

170 years. The challenge has been that a proof is only considered direct if it
does not rely on reductio ad absurdum. Thus, any proof that claims to be direct
must show, going back to the axioms, that all of the auxiliary theorems used
are also proved directly. In this paper, we give a proof of the Steiner-Lehmus
theorem that is guaranteed to be direct. The evidence for this claim is derived
from our methodology: we have formalized a constructive axiom set for Euclidean
plane geometry in a proof assistant that implements a constructive logic and
have built the proof of the Steiner-Lehmus theorem on this constructive
foundation.

actor-critic structure for continuous control tasks has received increasing
attention. It is still challenging to learn a near-optimal control policy with
safety and convergence guarantees. Also, few works have addressed the safe RL
algorithm design under time-varying safety constraints. This paper proposes a
model-based safe RL algorithm for optimal control of nonlinear systems with
time-varying state and control constraints. In the proposed approach, we
construct a novel barrier-based control policy structure that can guarantee
control safety. A multi-step policy evaluation mechanism is proposed to predict
the policy's safety risk under time-varying safety constraints and guide the
policy to update safely. Theoretical results on stability and robustness are
proven. Also, the convergence of the actor-critic learning algorithm is
analyzed. The performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms several
state-of-the-art RL algorithms in the simulated Safety Gym environment.
Furthermore, the approach is applied to the integrated path following and
collision avoidance problem for two real-world intelligent vehicles. A
differential-drive vehicle and an Ackermann-drive one are used to verify the
offline deployment performance and the online learning performance,
respectively. Our approach shows an impressive sim-to-real transfer capability
and a satisfactory online control performance in the experiment.

both optimization algorithms selected a comparable structure with similar

is in line with the CAP protocol to ensure multiple channels' arousals for CAP

receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82, with average accuracy ranging
from 77% to 79%, a result which is in the upper range of the specialist

experimentally thanks to its synthesis inside carbon nanotubes (CNTs). While
the role of the host CNT in determining the optical gap of the LCCs has been
studied previously, little is known about the excited states of such ultralong
LCCs. In this work, we employ the selectivity of wavelength-dependent resonant
Raman spectroscopy to investigate the excited states of ultralong LCCs
encapsulated inside double-walled CNTs. In addition to the optical gap, the
Raman resonance profile shows three additional resonances. Corroborated with
DFT calculations on LCCs with up to 100 C-atoms, we assign these resonances to
a vibronic series of a different electronic state. Indeed, the calculations
predict the existence of two optically allowed electronic states separated by
an energy of 0.14-0.22 eV in the limit of an infinite chain, in agreement with
the experimental results. Furthermore, among these two states, the one with
highest energy is also characterized by the largest electron-vibration
couplings, which explains the corresponding vibronic series of overtones.

robotic tasks in simulation, including visual navigation and manipulation.
Prior work generally aims to build embodied agents that solve their assigned
tasks as quickly as possible, while largely ignoring the problems caused by
collision with objects during interaction. This lack of prioritization is
understandable: there is no inherent cost in breaking virtual objects. As a
result, ""well-trained"" agents frequently collide with objects before achieving
their primary goals, a behavior that would be catastrophic in the real world.
In this paper, we study the problem of training agents to complete the task of
visual mobile manipulation in the ManipulaTHOR environment while avoiding
unnecessary collision (disturbance) with objects. We formulate disturbance
avoidance as a penalty term in the reward function, but find that directly
training with such penalized rewards often results in agents being unable to
escape poor local optima. Instead, we propose a two-stage training curriculum
where an agent is first allowed to freely explore and build basic competencies
without penalization, after which a disturbance penalty is introduced to refine
the agent's behavior. Results on testing scenes show that our curriculum not
only avoids these poor local optima, but also leads to 10% absolute gains in
success rate without disturbance, compared to our state-of-the-art baselines.
Moreover, our curriculum is significantly more performant than a safe RL
algorithm that casts collision avoidance as a constraint. Finally, we propose a
novel disturbance-prediction auxiliary task that accelerates learning.

out to look at things through a different lens. I make the (metaphorical)
hypothesis that human ancestors arrived on Earth along with security ceremonies
from a very far planet, the Cybersecurity planet. My hypothesis continues, in
that studying (by huge telescopes) the surface of Cybersecurity in combination
with the logical projection on that surface of what happens on Earth is
beneficial for us earthlings. I have spotted four cities so far on the remote
planet. Democratic City features security ceremonies that allow inhabitants to
follow personal paths of practice and, for example, make errors or be driven by
emotions. By contrast, security ceremonies in Dictatorial City compel
inhabitants to comply, thus behaving like programmed automata. Security
ceremonies in Beautiful City are so beautiful that inhabitants just love to
follow them precisely. Invisible City has security ceremonies that are not
perceivable, hence inhabitants feel like they never encounter any.
Incidentally, we use the words ""democratic"" and ""dictatorial"" without any
political connotation. A key argument I shall develop is that all cities but
Democratic City address the human factor, albeit in different ways. In the
light of these findings, I will also discuss security ceremonies of our planet,
such as WhatsApp web login and flight boarding, and explore room for improving
them based upon the current understanding of Cybersecurity.

The main building block of a GP regression is the covariance kernel, which
characterizes the relationship between pairs in the random field. The
optimization to find the optimal kernel, however, requires several large-scale
and often unstructured matrix inversions. We tackle this challenge by
introducing a hierarchical matrix approach, named HMAT, which effectively
decomposes the matrix structure, in a recursive manner, into significantly
smaller matrices where a direct approach could be used for inversion. Our
matrix partitioning uses a particular aggregation strategy for data points,
which promotes the low-rank structure of off-diagonal blocks in the
hierarchical kernel matrix. We employ a randomized linear algebra method for
matrix reduction on the low-rank off-diagonal blocks without factorizing a
large matrix. We provide analytical error and cost estimates for the inversion
of the matrix, investigate them empirically with numerical computations, and
demonstrate the application of our approach on three numerical examples
involving GP regression for engineering problems and a large-scale real
dataset. We provide the computer implementation of GP-HMAT, HMAT adapted for GP
likelihood and derivative computations, and the implementation of the last
numerical example on a real dataset. We demonstrate superior scalability of the
HMAT approach compared to built-in $\backslash$ operator in MATLAB for
large-scale linear solves $\bf{A}\bf{x} = \bf{y}$ via a repeatable and
verifiable empirical study. An extension to hierarchical semiseparable (HSS)
matrices is discussed as future research.

crustaceans through abundant food resources and refugia, and enhance secondary
production of populations. While small-scale studies remain important tools to
assess nursery value of habitats, targeted applications that unify survey data
over large spatiotemporal scales are vital to generalize inference of nursery
function, identify highly productive regions, and inform management strategies.
Using 21 years of GIS and spatiotemporally indexed field survey data on
potential nursery habitats, we constructed five Bayesian models with varying
spatiotemporal dependence structures to infer nursery habitat value for
juveniles of the blue crab C. sapidus within three tributaries in lower
Chesapeake Bay. Out-of-sample predictions of juvenile counts from a fully
nonseparable spatiotemporal model outperformed predictions from simpler models.
Salt marsh surface area, turbidity, and their interaction showed the strongest
associations (and positively) with abundance. Relative seagrass area,
previously emphasized as the most valuable nursery in small spatial-scale
studies, was not associated with abundance. Hence, we argue that salt marshes
should be considered a key nursery habitat for blue crabs, even amidst
extensive seagrass beds. Moreover, identification of nurseries should be based
on investigations at broad spatiotemporal scales incorporating multiple
potential nursery habitats, and on rigorously addressing spatiotemporal
dependence.
