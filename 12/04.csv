(3) How do current Entity Linking approaches exploit the specific

the chance to leverage Wikidata-specific characteristics to increase quality.
Almost all approaches employ specific properties like labels and sometimes
descriptions but ignore characteristics such as the hyper-relational structure.
Hence, there is still room for improvement, for example, by including
hyper-relational graph embeddings or type information. Many approaches also

planners. Hence, instead of fully automated scheduling systems steel
manufacturers prefer auxiliary recommendation algorithms. Through the
suggestion of suitable orders, these algorithms assist human expert planners
who are tasked with the selection and scheduling of production orders. However,
it is hard to estimate, what degree of complexity these algorithms should have
as steel campaign planning lacks precise rule-based procedures; in fact, it
requires extensive domain knowledge as well as intuition that can only be
acquired by years of business experience. Here, instead of developing new
algorithms or improving older ones, we introduce a shuffling-aided network
method to assess the complexity of the selection patterns established by a
human expert. This technique allows us to formalize and represent the tacit
knowledge that enters the campaign planning. As a result of the network
analysis, we have discovered that the choice of production orders is primarily
determined by the orders' carbon content. Surprisingly, trace elements like
manganese, silicon, and titanium have a lesser impact on the selection decision
than assumed by the pertinent literature. Our approach can serve as an input to
a range of decision-support systems, whenever a human expert needs to create
groups of orders ('campaigns') that fulfill certain implicit selection
criteria.

evolution of a state probability vector. Here, we present non-stochastic
numerical techniques to characterize the motion of individual defects migrating
over long distances prior to recombining or being absorbed by another defect,
resorting to the theory of absorbing Markov chains. These important events are
fully determined by their first-passage time distribution to distant locations,
no-passage distribution ,and walker fluxes to the sinks. We show that these
functions can be efficiently computed using a method combining Krylov subspace
projection and eigenvalue deflation. For a model system describing the
absorption of a vacancy by a cavity in aluminum, the use of a small Krylov
subspace deflated by the unique eigenmode corresponding to the quasi-stationary
distribution is sufficient to capture the kinetics of the defect absorption
faithfully. This method can be used in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to
perform stochastic non-local moves or in cluster dynamics simulations to

at the core of efficient light conversion sources. Typically, thick transparent
crystals or quasi-phase matched waveguides, are utilized in conjunction with
phase-matching techniques to select a single parametric process. In recent
years, due to the rapid developments in artificially structured materials,
optical frequency mixing has been achieved at the nanoscale in subwavelength
resonators arrayed as metasurfaces. Phase matching becomes relaxed for these
wavelength-scale structures, and all allowed nonlinear processes can, in
principle, occur on an equal footing. This could promote harmonic generation
via a cascaded (consisting of several frequency mixing steps) process. However,
so far, all reported work on dielectric metasurfaces have assumed frequency
mixing from a direct (single step) nonlinear process. In this work, we prove
the existence of cascaded second-order optical nonlinearities by analyzing the
second and third wave mixing from a highly nonlinear metasurface in conjunction
with polarization selection rules and crystal symmetries. We find that the
third wave mixing signal from a cascaded process can be of comparable strength
to that from conventional third harmonic generation, and that surface
nonlinearities are the dominant mechanism that contributes to cascaded second
order nonlinearities

mathematics problem of modelling user behaviour using machine learning methods,
in order to predict purchase intent of non-life insurance products. It is
valuable for a company to understand user interactions with their website as it
provides rich and individualized insight into consumer behaviour. Most of
existing research in user behaviour modelling aims to explain or predict clicks
on a search engine result page or to estimate click-through rate in sponsored
search. These models are based on concepts about users' examination patterns of
a web page and the web page's representation of items. Investigating the
problem of modelling user behaviour to predict purchase intent on a business
website, we observe that a user's intention yields high dependency on how the
user navigates the website in terms of how many different web pages the user
visited, what kind of web pages the user interacted with, and how much time the
user spent on each web page. Inspired by these findings, we propose two
different ways of representing features of a user session leading to two models
for user click-based purchase prediction: one based on a Feed Forward Neural
Network, and another based on a Recurrent Neural Network. We examine the
discriminativeness of user-clicks for predicting purchase intent by comparing
the above two models with a model using demographic features of the user. Our
experimental results show that our click-based models significantly outperform
the demographic model, in terms of standard classification evaluation metrics,
and that a model based on a sequential representation of user clicks yields
slightly greater performance than a model based on feature engineering of
clicks.

the outage rate criterion, which neglects the performance of the fraction of

communication scenarios, this paper takes a complementary approach by
introducing the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) rate as the expected rate of a
worst-case fraction of clients. To support differential quality-of-service
(QoS) levels in this class of clients, layered division multiplexing (LDM) is
applied, which enables decoding at different rates. Focusing on a practical
scenario in which the transmitter does not know the fading distribution, layer
allocation is optimized based on a dataset sampled during deployment. The
optimality gap caused by the availability of limited data is bounded via a
generalization analysis, and the sample complexity is shown to increase as the
designated fraction of worst-case clients decreases. Considering this
theoretical result, meta-learning is introduced as a means to reduce sample
complexity by leveraging data from previous deployments. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that LDM improves spectral efficiency even for small datasets;
that, for sufficiently large datasets, the proposed mirror-descent-based layer
optimization scheme achieves a CVaR rate close to that achieved when the
transmitter knows the fading distribution; and that meta-learning can
significantly reduce data requirements.

use of Wilson line operators, describing eikonal emissions from straight lines
extending to infinity. A generalization at subleading powers in the eikonal
expansion, known as Generalized Wilson Line (GWL), has been proposed some time
ago, and has been applied both in QCD phenomenology and in the high energy
limits of gravitational amplitudes. In this paper we revisit the construction
of the scalar gravitational GWL starting from first principles in the worldline
formalism. We identify the correct Hamiltonian that leads to a simple
correspondence between the soft expansion and the weak field expansion. This
allows us to isolate the terms in the GWL that are relevant in the classical
limit. In doing so we devote special care to the regularization of UV
divergences that were not discussed in an earlier derivation. We also clarify
the relation with a parallel body of work that recently investigated the
classical limit of scattering amplitudes in gravity in the worldline formalism.

a nanophotonic structure that possess special polarization properties such as a
polarization singularity, namely with right or left circularly polarization
(C-points). Recently, Chen et al. [Nature Physics 16, 571 (2020)] demonstrated
the surprising result of chiral radiation from a linearly-polarized (LP) dipole
emitter, and argued that this effect is caused by a decoupling with the
underlying eigenmodes of a non-Hermitian system, working at an exceptional
point (EP). Here we present a quasinormal mode (QNM) approach to model a
similar index-modulated ring resonator working near an EP and show the same
unusual chiral power flow properties from LP emitters, in direct agreement with
the experimental results. We explain these results quantitatively without
invoking the interpretation of a missing dimension (the Jordan vector) and a
decoupling from the cavity eigenmodes, since the correct eigenmodes are the
QNMs which explain the chiral emission using only two cavity modes. By coupling
a LP emitter with the dominant two QNMs of the ring resonator, we show how the
chiral emission depend on the position and orientation of the emitter, which is
also verified by the excellent agreement with respect to the power flow between
the QNM theory and full numerical dipole solutions. We also show how a normal
mode solution will fail to capture the correct chirality since it does not take
into account the essential QNM phase. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can
achieve frequency-dependent chiral emission, and replace lossy materials with
gain materials in the index modulation to reverse the chirality.

  Crowdsourced Data for Emergency Services","Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Emergency response is highly dependent on the time of incident reporting.
Unfortunately, the traditional approach to receiving incident reports (e.g.,
calling 911 in the USA) has time delays. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Waze
provide an opportunity for early identification of incidents. However,
detecting incidents from crowdsourced data streams is difficult due to the
challenges of noise and uncertainty associated with such data. Further, simply
optimizing over detection accuracy can compromise spatial-temporal localization
of the inference, thereby making such approaches infeasible for real-world
deployment. This paper presents a novel problem formulation and solution
approach for practitioner-centered incident detection using crowdsourced data
by using emergency response management as a case-study. The proposed approach
CROME (Crowdsourced Multi-objective Event Detection) quantifies the
relationship between the performance metrics of incident classification (e.g.,
F1 score) and the requirements of model practitioners (e.g., 1 km. radius for
incident detection). First, we show how crowdsourced reports, ground-truth
historical data, and other relevant determinants such as traffic and weather
can be used together in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for
early detection of emergency incidents. Then, we use a Pareto
optimization-based approach to optimize the output of the CNN in tandem with
practitioner-centric parameters to balance detection accuracy and
spatial-temporal localization. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of
this approach using crowdsourced data from Waze and traffic accident reports
from Nashville, TN, USA. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms existing approaches in incident detection while simultaneously
optimizing the needs for real-world deployment and usability.

take heritage from the optical imaging PLATO mission CCD270s and have been
optimised for low energy signals by including a parallel supplementary buried

reduce the number of traps it interacts with as it is transferred through the

predict its characteristics pre-fabrication over a 10^2-10^5 electron signal

number of traps present and hence calculate the mean amount of trapsthat exist
per pixel across the range of signal levels. The trap pumping results are used
to calculate a charge transfer performance improvement that shows good
agreement with the simulated values, especially in the SXI science band.These
results bring added confidence to the early performance modelling of the SMILE

to ensure that the robot is relevant for long-term use and its perceptions are

network (DBN) to capture the longitudinal interactions participants had with a
teleoperated robot coach (RC) delivering mindfulness sessions. The DBN model is
used to study complex, temporal interactions between the participants
self-reported personality traits, weekly baseline wellbeing scores, session
ratings, and facial AUs elicited during the sessions in a 5-week longitudinal
study. DBN modelling involves learning a graphical representation that
facilitates intuitive understanding of how multiple components contribute to
the longitudinal changes in session ratings corresponding to the perceptions of
the RC, and participants relaxation and calm levels. The learnt model captures
the following within and between sessions aspects of the longitudinal
interaction study: influence of the 5 personality dimensions on the facial AU
states and the session ratings, influence of facial AU states on the session
ratings, and the influences within the items of the session ratings. The DBN
structure is learnt using first 3 time points and the obtained model is used to
predict the session ratings of the last 2 time points of the 5-week
longitudinal data. The predictions are quantified using subject-wise RMSE and
R2 scores. We also demonstrate two applications of the model, namely,
imputation of missing values in the dataset and estimation of longitudinal
session ratings of a new participant with a given personality profile. The
obtained DBN model thus facilitates learning of conditional dependency
structure between variables in the longitudinal data and offers inferences and
conceptual understanding which are not possible through other regression
methodologies.

advances in processing have led to the emergence of fully integrated LiNbO3
electro-optic devices, including low-voltage, high-speed modulators,
electro-optic frequency combs, and microwave-optical transducers. Yet to date,
LiNbO3 photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have mostly been fabricated using
non-standard etching techniques that lack the reproducibility routinely
achieved in silicon photonics. Widespread future application of thin-film
LiNbO3 requires a reliable and scalable solution using standard processing and
precise lithographic control. Here we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated
LiNbO3 photonic platform that overcomes the abovementioned challenges by
employing wafer-scale bonding of thin-film LiNbO3 to planarized low-loss
silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits, a mature foundry-grade
integrated photonic platform. The resulting devices combine the substantial
Pockels effect of LiNbO3 with the scalability, high-yield, and complexity of
the underlying Si3N4 PICs. Importantly, the platform maintains the low
propagation loss (<0.1 dB/cm) and efficient fiber-to-chip coupling (<2.5 dB per
facet) of the Si3N4 waveguides. We find that ten transitions between a mode
confined in the Si3N4 PIC and the hybrid LiNbO$_3$ mode produce less than 0.8
dB additional loss, corresponding to a loss per transition not exceeding 0.1
dB. These nearly lossless adiabatic transitions thus link the low-loss passive
Si3N4 photonic structures with electro-optic components. We demonstrate high-Q
microresonators, optical splitters, electrically tunable photonic dimers,
electro-optic frequency combs, and carrier-envelope phase detection of a
femtosecond laser on the same platform, thus providing a reliable and
foundry-ready solution to low-loss and complex LiNbO3 integrated photonic
circuits.

mixture, a downwards solutal Marangoni flow is generated on the surface of the
drop, owing to the concentration gradient, and the resulting propulsion
competes against the downwards gravitational acceleration of the heavy drop. In
prior work of Li et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 126, issue 12, 2021, 124502),
we found that for drops of low viscosity, an oscillatory instability of the
Marangoni flow is triggered once the Marangoni advection is too strong for
diffusion to restore the stratified concentration field around the drop. Here
we experimentally explore the parameter space of the concentration gradient and
drop radius for large oil viscosities and find a different and new mechanism
for triggering the oscillatory instability in which diffusion is no longer the
limiting factor. For such drops of higher viscosities, the instability is
triggered when the gravitational effect is too strong so that the viscous
stress cannot maintain a stable Marangoni flow. This leads to a critical drop
radius above which the equilibrium is always unstable. Subsequently, a unifying
scaling theory that includes both the mechanisms for low and for high
viscosities of the oil drops is developed. The transition between the two
mechanisms is found to be controlled by two length scales: The drop radius $R$
and the boundary layer thickness $\delta$ of the Marangoni flow around the
drop. The instability is dominated by diffusion for $\delta<R$ and by viscosity
for $R<\delta$. The experimental results for various drops of different
viscosities can well be described with this unifying scaling theory. Our
theoretical description thus provides a unifying view of physicochemical
hydrodynamic problems in which the Marangoni stress is competing with a stable
stratification.

superconducting quantum processor, substantially larger than previous work
based on less scalable compression techniques, and going beyond the family of
1D Fermi-Hubbard instances, which are solvable classically. Consistent with
predictions for the ground state, we observe the onset of the metal-insulator

eight different convolutional neural networks, each with identical ResNet

within different learning systems. Specifically, the representations are
trained to guide action in a compound reinforcement learning task; to predict
one or a combination of three task-related targets with supervision; or using
one of three different unsupervised objectives. Using representational
similarity analysis, we find that the network trained with reinforcement
learning differs most from the other networks. Using metrics inspired by the
neuroscience literature, we find that the model trained with reinforcement
learning has a sparse and high-dimensional representation wherein individual
images are represented with very different patterns of neural activity. Further
analysis suggests these representations may arise in order to guide long-term
behavior and goal-seeking in the RL agent. Finally, we compare the
representations learned by the RL agent to neural activity from mouse visual
cortex and find it to perform as well or better than other models. Our results
provide insights into how the properties of neural representations are

is employed in which the highest stresses in the principal material coordinates
are grouped separately into two clusters using an adjusted $P$-norm. A detailed
description of the formulation and sensitivity analysis is discussed. While we
present an analysis of 2D structures in the numerical examples section, the
method can also be used for 3D structures, as the formulation is generic. Our

proximity to a large galaxy group with $M_\mathrm{dyn}\sim10^{13.5}\,M_\odot$.
We identify seven HI peak concentrations, interconnected as a tenuous 'chain'
structure, extending $\sim 400\,\mathrm{kpc}$ from east-to-west, with the
largest (central) concentration containing $10{^{9.7}}\,M_\odot$ in HI gas
distributed across $50\,\mathrm{kpc}$. The main source is not detected in
ultra-violet, optical or infrared imaging. The implied gas mass-to-light
($M_\mathrm{HI}$/$L_\mathrm{r}$) is extreme ($>$1000) even in comparison to
other 'dark clouds'. The complex has very little kinematic structure
($110\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), making it difficult to identify cloud
rotation. Assuming pressure support, the total mass of the central
concentration is $>10^{10.2}\,M_\odot$, while a lower limit to the dynamical
mass in the case of full rotational support is $10^{10.4}\,M_\odot$. If the
central concentration is a stable structure, it has to contain some amount of
unseen matter, but potentially less than is observed for a typical galaxy. It
is, however, not clear whether the structure has any gravitationally stable
concentrations. We report a faint UV--optical--infrared source in proximity to
one of the smaller concentrations in the gas complex, leading to a possible
stellar association. The system nature and origins is enigmatic, potentially
being the result of an interaction with or within the galaxy group it appears
to be associated with.

pivotal for heat management at the nanoscale. One promising strategy to obtain
the desired transport properties is to engineer particular spectral structures.
In this work we are interested in quasiperiodic disorder - incommensurate with
the underlying periodicity of the lattice - which induces fractality in the
energy spectrum. A well known example is the Fibonacci model which, despite
being non-interacting, yields anomalous diffusion with a continuously varying
dynamical exponent smoothly crossing over from superdiffusive to subdiffusive
regime as a function of potential strength. We study the finite-temperature
electric and heat transport of this model in linear response in the absence and
in the presence of dephasing noise due to inelastic scattering. The dephasing
causes both thermal and electric transport to become diffusive, thereby making
thermal and electrical conductivities finite in the thermodynamic limit. Thus,
in the subdiffusive regime it leads to enhancement of transport. We find that
the thermal and electric conductivities have multiple peaks as a function of
dephasing strength. Remarkably, we observe that the thermal and electrical
conductivities are not proportional to each other, a clear violation of
Wiedemann-Franz law, and the position of their maxima can differ. We argue that
this feature can be utilized to enhance performance of quantum thermal
machines. In particular, we show that by tuning the strength of the dephasing
noise we can enhance the performance of the device in regimes where it acts as
an autonomous refrigerator.

applications ranging from 5G telecommunication and microwave photonics to
microwave-to-optical quantum interfaces. Lithium niobate integrated photonic
circuits could equally be the basis of integrated narrow-linewidth

resonators has led to the development of electrically tunable narrow-linewidth

niobate integrated photonics and demonstrate their use for coherent laser
ranging. This is achieved through heterogeneous integration of ultra-low-loss
silicon nitride photonic circuits with thin-film lithium niobate via direct
wafer bonding. This platform features low propagation loss of 8.5 dB/m enabling
narrow-linewidth lasing (intrinsic linewidth of 3 kHz) by self-injection
locking to a III-V semiconductor laser diode. The hybrid mode of the resonator
allows electro-optical laser frequency tuning at a speed of 12 PHz/s with high
linearity, low hysteresis and while retaining narrow linewidth. Using this
hybrid integrated laser, we perform a proof-of-concept FMCW LiDAR ranging
experiment, with a resolution of 15 cm. By fully leveraging the high
electro-optic coefficient of lithium niobate, with further improvements in
photonic integrated circuits design, these devices can operate with
CMOS-compatible voltages, or achieve mm-scale distance resolution. Endowing low

tunable lasers from the visible to the mid-infrared, with applications from OCT

battery degradation explicitly consider the interactions between more than two
degradation mechanisms, and none do so within a single electrode. In this
paper, the first published attempt to directly couple more than two degradation
mechanisms in the negative electrode is reported. The results are used to map
different pathways through the complicated path dependent and non-linear
degradation space. Four degradation mechanisms are coupled in PyBaMM, an open
source modelling environment uniquely developed to allow new physics to be
implemented and explored quickly and easily. Crucially it is possible to see
'inside' the model and observe the consequences of the different patterns of
degradation, such as loss of lithium inventory and loss of active material. For
the same cell, five different pathways that can result in end-of-life have
already been found, depending on how the cell is used. Such information would
enable a product designer to either extend life or predict life based upon the
usage pattern. However, parameterization of the degradation models remains as a
major challenge, and requires the attention of the international battery
community.

$W_a$($W_r$) is attractive(repulsive) such that $W_a<W_r$. In three dimensions
$W_a$ tends to zero, $W_r$ remains finite, indicating metal-insulator

several years with better models and training methods. More, and more diverse,

datasets is time-consuming and challenging. Ways of augmenting the volume and
diversity of clean, labeled data generally have wide applicability. For some
languages (e.g., Ruby) labeled data is less abundant; in others (e.g.,
JavaScript) the available data maybe more focused on some application domains,
and thus less diverse. As a way around such data bottlenecks, we present
evidence suggesting that human-written code in different languages (which
performs the same function), is rather similar, and particularly preserving of
identifier naming patterns; we further present evidence suggesting that
identifiers are a very important element of training data for software
engineering tasks. We leverage this rather fortuitous phenomenon to find
evidence that available multilingual training data (across different languages)
can be used to amplify performance. We study this for 3 different tasks: code
summarization, code retrieval, and function naming. We note that this

fairly insensitive on the phase transition. Nonequilibrium simulations with an

is often used to avoid spurious voltages that are caused by the flow of

spin precession, or spin Hall measurements background signals have been

erroneous or misleading conclusions when falsely attributed to spin transport.
The charge-driven signals can be divided into two groups: Signals that are
inherent to the device structure and/or the measurement setup and signals that
depend on a common-mode voltage. We designed and built a voltage-controlled
current source that significantly diminishes all spurious voltage signals of
the latter group in both DC and AC measurements by creating a virtual ground
within the non-local detection circuit. This is especially important for
lock-in-based measurement techniques, where a common-mode voltage can create a
phase-shifted, frequency-dependent signal with an amplitude several orders of
magnitude larger than the actual spin signal. Measurements performed on
graphene-based non-local spin valve devices demonstrate how all spurious
voltage signals that are caused by a common-mode voltage can be completely
suppressed by such a current source.

Typical focused ion beam implantation relies on knowing the beam current and
setting a pulse length of the ion pulse to define the number of ions implanted
at each location, referred to as timed implantation in this paper. This process
is dominated by Poisson statistics resulting in large errors for low number of
implanted ions. Instead, we use in-situ detection to measure the number of ions
arriving at the substrate resulting in a two-fold reduction in the error on the
number of implanted ions used to generate a single optically active silicon
vacancy (SiV) defect in diamond compared to timed implantation. Additionally,
through post-implantation analysis, we can further reduce the error resulting
in a seven-fold improvement compared to timed implantation, allowing us to
better estimate the conversion yield of implanted Si to SiV. We detect SiV
emitters by photoluminescence spectroscopy, determine the number of emitters
per location and calculate the yield to be 2.98 + 0.21 / - 0.24 %. Candidates
for single photon emitters are investigated further by Hanbury-Brown-Twiss
interferometry confirming that 82 % of the locations exhibit single photon
emission statistics. This counted ion implantation technique paves the way
towards deterministic creation of SiV when ion counting is used in combination
with methods that improve the activation yield of SiV.

observable that encodes the physical conditions under which these massive
stellar clusters formed and evolved. The high-mass end of star cluster mass
functions are commonly described using a Schechter function, with an
exponential truncation mass $M_{c,*}$. For the GC mass functions in the Virgo
galaxy cluster, this truncation mass increases with galaxy mass ($M_{*}$). In
this paper we fit Schechter mass functions to the GCs in the most massive
galaxy group ($M_{\mathrm{200}} = 5.14 \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) in the
E-MOSAICS simulations. The fiducial cluster formation model in E-MOSAICS
reproduces the observed trend of $M_{c,*}$ with $M_{*}$ for the Virgo cluster.
We therefore examine the origin of the relation by fitting $M_{c,*}$ as a
function of galaxy mass, with and without accounting for mass loss by two-body
relaxation, tidal shocks and/or dynamical friction. In the absence of these
mass-loss mechanisms, the $M_{c,*}$-$M_{*}$ relation is flat above $M_* >
10^{10} M_{\odot}$. It is therefore the disruption of high-mass GCs in galaxies
with $M_{*}\sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ that lowers the $M_{c,*}$ in these galaxies.
High-mass GCs are able to survive in more massive galaxies, since there are
more mergers to facilitate their redistribution to less-dense environments. The
$M_{c,*}-M_*$ relation is therefore a consequence of both the formation
conditions of massive star clusters and their environmentally-dependent
disruption mechanisms.

N2, and O2 are unconstrained in all cases. The limit for a CH4 detection is R

  in Philadelphia",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimation of the spatial heterogeneity in crime incidence across an entire
city is an important step towards reducing crime and increasing our
understanding of the physical and social functioning of urban environments.
This is a difficult modeling endeavor since crime incidence can vary smoothly
across space and time but there also exist physical and social barriers that
result in discontinuities in crime rates between different regions within a
city. A further difficulty is that there are different levels of resolution
that can be used for defining regions of a city in order to analyze crime. To
address these challenges, we develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach for the
clustering of urban areal units at different levels of resolution
simultaneously. Our approach is evaluated with an extensive synthetic data
study and then applied to the estimation of crime incidence at various levels
of resolution in the city of Philadelphia.

compute two regional indicators of dispersion and the cost of inclusion into a

conclude that the region does not meet the required symmetry and synchronicity

center networks. However, the high optical loss of many optical components
coupled with the low efficiency of laser sources result in high aggregate power
requirements for the thousands of optical transceivers used by these networks.
As optical interconnects stay always on even as traffic demands ebb and flow,
most of this power is wasted. We present LC/DC, a data center network system
architecture in which the operating system, the switch, and the optical
components are co-designed to achieve energy proportionality.
  LC/DC capitalizes on the path divergence of data center networks to turn on
and off redundant paths according to traffic demand, while maintaining full
connectivity. Turning off redundant paths allows the optical transceivers and
their electronic drivers to power down and save energy. Maintaining full
connectivity hides the laser turn-on delay. At the node layer, intercepting
send requests within the OS allows for the NIC's laser turn-on delay to be
fully overlapped with TCP/IP packet processing, and thus egress links can
remain powered off until needed with zero performance penalty.
  We demonstrate the feasibility of LC/DC by i) implementing the necessary
modifications in the Linux kernel and device drivers, ii) implementing a
10Gbit/s FPGA switch, and iii) performing physical experiments with optical
devices and circuit simulations. Our results on university data center traces

in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we start by synthesizing usable data
through recovering the knowledge from a pre-trained deep neural network. Then
we use the synthesized data and their predicted soft-labels to guide neural
architecture search. We identify that the NAS task requires the synthesized
data (we target at image domain here) with enough semantics, diversity, and a
minimal domain gap from the natural images. For semantics, we propose recursive
label calibration to produce more informative outputs. For diversity, we
propose a regional update strategy to generate more diverse and
semantically-enriched synthetic data. For minimal domain gap, we use input and
feature-level regularization to mimic the original data distribution in latent
space. We instantiate our proposed framework with three popular NAS algorithms:
DARTS, ProxylessNAS and SPOS. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that the
architectures discovered by searching with our synthetic data achieve accuracy
that is comparable to, or even higher than, architectures discovered by
searching from the original ones, for the first time, deriving the conclusion
that NAS can be done effectively with no need of access to the original or
called natural data if the synthesis method is well designed.

proprioceptive feedback to ensure the safety of the planned path by sensing
unexpected obstacles like glass walls, terrain properties like slipperiness or
softness of the ground and robot properties like extra payload that are likely
missed by vision. The navigation system uses onboard cameras to generate an
occupancy map and a corresponding cost map to reach the goal. A fast marching
planner then generates a target path. A velocity command generator takes this
as input to generate the desired velocity for the walking policy. A safety

anatomical consistency constraints. Our method is a post-processing that takes
as input segmented echocardiographic sequences produced by any state-of-the-art

inconsistencies according to the overall dynamics of the cardiac sequence and
(ii) correct the inconsistencies. The identification and correction of cardiac
inconsistencies relies on a constrained autoencoder trained to learn a
physiologically interpretable embedding of cardiac shapes, where we can both
detect and fix anomalies. We tested our framework on 98 full-cycle sequences

improve on previous methods based on the use of the wavelet transform to
systematically search for the kinematic signature of the Sgr stream in the Gaia

statistical properties of the colour-magnitude diagrams. Our final sample
contains > 700k candidate stars, 3x larger than previous samples. We have been
able to detect the bifurcation of the stream in both the northern and southern
hemispheres, requiring four branches to fully describe this system. We present
the detailed proper motion distribution of the trailing arm as a function of
Lambda showing the presence of a sharp edge (on the side of the small proper
motions) beyond which there are no Sgr stars. We also characterise the
correlation between kinematics and distance. The chemical analysis of our
sample shows a significant difference between the faint and bright branches. We
provide analytical descriptions for the proper motion trends as well as for the

bifurcations as the misaligned overlap of the material stripped at the
antepenultimate pericentre (faint branches) with the stars ejected at the
penultimate pericentre (bright branch). The source of this misalignment is
still unknown but we argue that models with some internal rotation in the

provides a path to reduce the bias from two of the most dominant foregrounds,
the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ) and the Cosmic Infrared Background

tSZ alone and the CIB alone bias the lensing auto spectrum by 0.6 sigma and 1.1
sigma respectively, in the lensing multipole range of L in [5000,20000] for a
CMB-HD survey; combined these foregrounds yield a bias of only 1.3 sigma.
Including these foregrounds, we also find that a CMB-HD survey can distinguish
between a CDM model and a 10^-22 eV FDM model at the 5 sigma level. These
results provide an important step in demonstrating that foreground
contamination can be sufficiently reduced to enable a robust measurement of the

circum-stellar disk that is located in a binary system. Applying 3D resistive
MHD simulations, we investigate the local and global properties of the system,
such as the angular momentum transport and the accretion and ejection mass
fluxes. In comparison to previous works, for the first time, we have considered
the full magnetic torque, the presence of an outflow, thus the angular momentum
transport by vertical motion, and the binary torque. We discuss its specific 3D
structure, and how it is affected by tidal effects. We find that the spiral
structure evolving in the disk is {\em launched into the outflow}. We propose
to call this newly discovered structure a {\em jet spiral wall}. These spiral
features follow the same time evolution, with the jet spiral somewhat lagging
the disk spiral. We find that the vertical transport of angular momentum has a
significant role in the total angular momentum budget also in a binary system.
The same holds for the magnetic torque, however, the contribution from the
$\phi$-derivative of magnetic pressure and the $B_{\phi}B_r$ stresses are
small. The gravity torque arising from the time-dependent 3D Roche potential
becomes essential, as it constitutes the fundamental cause for all 3D effects
appearing in our disk-jet system. Quantitatively, we find that the disk
accretion rate in a binary system increases by $20\%$ compared to a disk around
a single star. The disk wind mass flux increases by even 50\%.

These methods can be applied to a large class of relational observables within

application we consider four scalar fields coupled to gravity to represent the
physical coordinate frame from which relational observables can be constructed.
At leading order of the derivative expansion the observables are the inverse
relational metric and the relational scalar curvature. We evaluate their
scaling dimensions at the fixed point, both in the standard renormalisation
group scheme and in the essential scheme. This represents the first steps to
describe running observables within asymptotic safety; this treatment can be
generalised to other observables constructed from different tensors and in
different physical coordinate systems.

accelerate towards or away from each other due to spacetime curvature. The GDE
assumes that nearby geodesics have a small rate of separation, which is
formally treated as the same order in smallness as the separation itself. This
assumption is discussed in various papers, but is typically not recognized in
textbooks. Relaxing this assumption leads to the generalized geodesic deviation
equation (GGDE). We demonstrate the distinction between the GDE and the GGDE by
computing the relative acceleration between timelike geodesics in
two-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. We do this by considering a fiducial
geodesic and a secondary geodesic (both timelike) that cross with nonzero
speed. These geodesics are spanned by a spacelike geodesic, whose tangent
evaluated at the fiducial geodesic defines the separation. The second
derivative of the separation describes the relative acceleration between the
fiducial and secondary geodesics. Near the crossing point, where the separation
between the timelike geodesics is small but their rates of separation can be
large, we show that the GGDE holds but the GDE fails to apply.

at the receiver terminals to store an accurate digital representation of the
received signal, thereby allowing for reliable decoding of transmitted
messages. However, in a wide range of applications, such as communication over
millimeter wave and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the
use of high resolution ADCs is not feasible due to power budget limitations. In
the conventional fully digital receiver design, where each receiver antenna is
connected to a distinct ADC, reducing the ADC resolution leads to performance
loss in terms of achievable rates. One proposed method to mitigate the
rate-loss is to use analog linear combiners leading to design of hybrid
receivers. Here, the hybrid framework is augmented by the addition of delay
elements to allow for temporal analog processing. Two new classes of receivers
consisting of delay elements, analog linear combiners, and one-bit ADCs are
proposed. The fundamental limits of communication in single and multi-user
(uplink and downlink) MIMO systems employing the proposed receivers are
investigated. In the high signal to noise ratio regime, it is shown that the
proposed receivers achieve the maximum achievable rates among all receivers

operate under communication constraints. We consider a network of agents that
must solve an online optimization problem from continual observation of
streaming data. The agents implement a distributed cooperative strategy where
each agent is allowed to perform local exchange of information with its
neighbors. In order to cope with communication constraints, the exchanged
information must be unavoidably compressed. We propose a diffusion strategy
nicknamed as ACTC (Adapt-Compress-Then-Combine), which relies on the following
steps: i) an adaptation step where each agent performs an individual
stochastic-gradient update with constant step-size; ii) a compression step that
leverages a recently introduced class of stochastic compression operators; and
iii) a combination step where each agent combines the compressed updates
received from its neighbors. The distinguishing elements of this work are as
follows. First, we focus on adaptive strategies, where constant (as opposed to
diminishing) step-sizes are critical to respond in real time to nonstationary
variations. Second, we consider the general class of directed graphs and
left-stochastic combination policies, which allow us to enhance the interplay
between topology and learning. Third, in contrast with related works that
assume strong convexity for all individual agents' cost functions, we require
strong convexity only at a network level, a condition satisfied even if a
single agent has a strongly-convex cost and the remaining agents have
non-convex costs. Fourth, we focus on a diffusion (as opposed to consensus)
strategy. Under the demanding setting of compressed information, we establish
that the ACTC iterates fluctuate around the desired optimizer, achieving
remarkable savings in terms of bits exchanged between neighboring agents.

generated to estimate the complex disturbances acting on the system. Then, two
different control strategies based on active disturbance rejection control
(ADRC) and computed torque model are implemented on a two-axis gimbal system.
The purpose is to improve the robustness, environmental adaptability and
tracking accuracy of the system and reduce the tuning effort of ADRC by
integrating a neural network (NN) based disturbance compensator (NN assisted
ADRC). In the second control strategy, NN is replaced with a computed torque
model (CTM assisted ADRC), whose inputs come from plant outputs. The simulation
results show that, NN and CTM assisted ADRC structures can decrease mean
tracking errors up to 85.4% and 40.8%, respectively.

chemical potential and is yet free from any such uncontrolled systematics: with
this approach the only problem is the sign problem itself. In practice the
approach involves the generation of configurations with the positive fermionic
weights given by the absolute value of the real part of the quark determinant,
and a reweighting by a sign. There are only two sectors, +1 and -1 and as long
as the average $\left\langle \pm \right\rangle \neq 0$ (with respect to the
positive weight) this discrete reweighting has no overlap problem - unlike
reweighting from $\mu=0$ - and the results are reliable. We also present
results based on this algorithm on the phase diagram of lattice QCD with two
different actions: as a first test, we apply the method to calculate the
position of the critical endpoint with unimproved staggered fermions at
$N_\tau=4$; as a second application, we study the phase diagram with 2stout
improved staggered fermions at $N_\tau=6$. This second one is already a
reasonably fine lattice - relevant for phenomenology. We demonstrate that the

the detailed process of coherent organic exciton-polariton transport and in

femtosecond transient absorption microscopy to directly image coherent

transport to be well-described by a model of band-like propagation of an
initially Gaussian distribution of exciton-polaritons in real space. The
velocity of the polaritons reaches values of ~0.65x10^6 m s-1, substantially
lower than expected from the polariton dispersion. Further, we find that the

this unexpected link between the quality-factor and polariton velocity and slow
coherent transport to be a result of varying admixing between delocalised dark

resolution can be made indirectly at the footpoints of reconnected loops into
which flare energy is deposited. The response of the lower atmosphere to this
energy input includes a downward-propagating shock called chromospheric
condensation, which can be observed in the UV and visible. In order to
characterize reconnection using high-resolution observations of this response,
one must develop a quantitative relationship between the two. Such a relation
was recently developed and here we test it on observations of chromospheric
condensation in a single footpoint from a flare ribbon of the X1.0 flare on 25
Oct. 2014 (SOL2014-10-25T16:56:36). Measurements taken of Si iv 1402.77 {\AA}
emission spectra using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in a
single pixel show red-shifted component undergoing characteristic condensation
evolution. We apply the technique called the Ultraviolet Footpoint Calorimeter
(UFC) to infer energy deposition into the one footpoint. This energy profile,
persisting much longer than the observed condensation, is input into a
one-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulation to compute the chromospheric response,
which contains a very brief condensation episode. From this simulation we
synthesize Si iv spectra and compute the time-evolving Doppler velocity. The
synthetic velocity evolution is found to compare reasonably well with the IRIS
observation, thus corroborating our reconnection-condensation relationship. The
exercise reveals that the chromospheric condensation characterizes a particular
portion of the reconnection energy release rather than its entirety, and that
the time scale of condensation does not necessarily reflect the time scale of
energy input.

scattering from magnetic fluctuations. In the ISM, for CRs with energies
~MeV-TeV, these fluctuations are usually attributed either to 'extrinsic
turbulence' (ET) - a cascade from larger scales - or 'self-confinement' (SC) -
self-generated fluctuations from CR streaming. Using simple analytic arguments
and detailed live numerical CR transport calculations in galaxy simulations, we
show that both of these, in standard form, cannot explain even basic
qualitative features of observed CR spectra. For ET, any spectrum that obeys
critical balance or features realistic anisotropy, or any spectrum that
accounts for finite damping below the dissipation scale, predicts qualitatively
incorrect spectral shapes and scalings of B/C and other species. Even if
somehow one ignored both anisotropy and damping, observationally-required
scattering rates disagree with ET predictions by orders-of-magnitude. For SC,
the dependence of driving on CR energy density means that it is nearly
impossible to recover observed CR spectral shapes and scalings, and again there
is an orders-of-magnitude normalization problem. But more severely, SC
solutions with super-Alfvenic streaming are unstable. In live simulations, they
revert to either arbitrarily-rapid CR escape with zero secondary production, or
to bottleneck solutions with far-too-strong CR confinement and secondary
production. Resolving these fundamental issues without discarding basic plasma
processes requires invoking different drivers for scattering fluctuations.
These must act on a broad range of scales with a power spectrum obeying several
specific (but plausible) constraints.

method results in overuse of herbicide and reduction in crop yield while the
latter is often untenable in large scale operations. This paper presents the
first fully autonomous robot for weed management for row crops capable of
computer vision based navigation, weed detection, complete field coverage, and
automatic recharge for under \$400. The target application is autonomous
inter-row weed control in crop fields, e.g. flax and canola, where the spacing
between croplines is as small as one foot. The proposed robot is small enough
to pass between croplines at all stages of plant growth while detecting weeds
and spraying herbicide. A recharging system incorporates newly designed robotic
hardware, a ramp, a robotic charging arm, and a mobile charging station. An
integrated vision algorithm is employed to assist with charger alignment
effectively. Combined, they enable the robot to work continuously in the field
without access to electricity. In addition, a color-based contour algorithm
combined with preprocessing techniques is applied for robust navigation relying
on the input from the onboard monocular camera. Incorporating such compact
robots into farms could help automate weed control, even during late stages of

High-quality measurements of electromagnetic fields and electron velocity

magnetosheath present a unique opportunity to characterize plasma turbulence
and to determine the mechanisms responsible for its dissipation. We apply the
field-particle correlation technique to a set of twenty MMS magnetosheath
intervals to identify the dissipation mechanism and quantify the dissipation
rate. It is found that 95% of the intervals have velocity-space signatures of
electron Landau damping that are quantitatively consistent with linear kinetic
theory for the collisionless damping of kinetic Alfv\'en waves. About 75% of
the intervals contain asymmetric signatures, indicating a local imbalance of
kinetic Alfv\'en wave energy flux in one direction along the magnetic field
than the other. About one third of the intervals have an electron energization
rate with the same order-of-magnitude as the estimated turbulent cascade rate,
suggesting that electron Landau damping plays a significant, and sometimes
dominant, role in the dissipation of the turbulent energy in these

emerge in chiral magnetic materials as a stable spin configuration under
external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ with the competition of ferromagnetic
interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) at low temperature $T$.
Skyrmion configurations are also known to be stable (unstable) under a
compressive stress applied parallel (perpendicular) to $\vec{B}$. To understand
the origin of such experimentally confirmed stability/instability, we use the
Finsler geometry modeling technique with a new degree of freedom for strains,
which plays an essential role in DMI being anisotropic. We find from MC data
that the area of the skyrmion state on the $B$-$T$ phase diagram increases
(decreases) depending on the direction of applied stresses, in agreement with
reported experimental results. This change in the area of the skyrmion state
indicates that skyrmions become more (less) stable if the tensile strain
direction is parallel (perpendicular) to $\vec{B}$. From the numerical data in
this paper, we find that the so-called magneto-elastic effect is suitably
implemented in the effective DMI theory with the strain degree of freedom
without complex magneto-elastic coupling terms for chiral magnetic materials.
This result confirms that experimentally-observed skyrmion stability and
instability are caused by DMI anisotropy.

Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling strategies are the benchmark due to their
flexibility and robustness in dealing with arbitrary posterior probability
density functions (PDFs). However, these algorithms been shown to be
inefficient when sampling from posterior distributions that are
high-dimensional or exhibit multi-modality and/or strong parameter
correlations. In such contexts, the sequential Monte Carlo technique of
transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) provides a more efficient
alternative. Despite the recent applicability for Bayesian updating and model
selection across a variety of disciplines, TMCMC may require a prohibitive
number of tempering stages when the prior PDF is significantly different from
the target posterior. Furthermore, the need to start with an initial set of
samples from the prior distribution may present a challenge when dealing with
implicit priors, e.g. based on feasible regions. Finally, TMCMC can not be used
for inverse problems with improper prior PDFs that represent lack of prior
knowledge on all or a subset of parameters. In this investigation, a
generalization of TMCMC that alleviates such challenges and limitations is
proposed, resulting in a tempering sampling strategy of enhanced robustness and
computational efficiency. Convergence analysis of the proposed sequential Monte
Carlo algorithm is presented, proving that the distance between the
intermediate distributions and the target posterior distribution monotonically
decreases as the algorithm proceeds. The enhanced efficiency associated with
the proposed generalization is highlighted through a series of test inverse
problems and an engineering application in the oil and gas industry.

provides seasonal daily precipitation over Europe on a 0.25 x 0.25 grid (about
27 x 27 km). This translates more than 20,000 land grid points and leads to
models with a large number of parameters when estimating return levels. To
bypass this abundance of parameters, we build on the regional frequency
analysis (RFA), a well-known strategy in statistical hydrology. This approach
consists in identifying homogeneous regions, by gathering locations with
similar distributions of extremes up to a normalizing factor and developing
sparse regional models. In particular, we propose a step-by-step blueprint that
leverages a recently developed and fast clustering algorithm to infer return
level estimates over large spatial domains. This enables us to produce maps of
return level estimates of ERA-5 reanalysis daily precipitation over continental
Europe for various return periods and seasons. We discuss limitations and
practical challenges and also provide a git hub repository. We show that a
relatively parsimonious model with only a spatially varying scale parameter can

is issued to begin with, and thus modeled decisions affect what data is
available to the lender for future decisions. As a result, it is possible for
the lender's algorithm to ``get stuck'' with a self-fulfilling model. This
model never corrects its false negatives, since it never sees the true label
for rejected data, thus accumulating infinite regret. In the case of linear
models, this issue can be addressed by adding optimism directly into the model
predictions. However, there are few methods that extend to the function
approximation case using Deep Neural Networks. We present Pseudo-Label Optimism
(PLOT), a conceptually and computationally simple method for this setting

state is known to be an anti-ferromagnetic Mott insulator. Doping Mott
insulators is believed to be relevant to the superconductivity observed in
cuprates. A variety of candidates have been proposed for the ground state of
the doped 2D Hubbard model. A recent work employing a combination of several
state-of-the-art numerical many-body methods, established the stripe order as
the ground state near $1/8$ doping at strong interactions. In this work, we
apply one of these methods, the cutting-edge constrained-path auxiliary field
quantum Monte Carlo method with self-consistently optimized gauge constraints,
to systematically study the model as a function of doping and interaction
strength. With careful finite size scaling based on large-scale computations,
we map out the ground state phase diagram in terms of its spin and charge
order. We find that modulated antiferromagnetic order persists from near
half-filling to about $1/5$ doping. At lower interaction strengths or larger
doping, these ordered states are best described as spin-density waves, with
essentially delocalized holes and modest oscillations in charge correlations.
When the charge correlations are stronger (large interaction or small doping),
they are best described as stripe states, with the holes more localized near
the node in the antiferromagnetic spin order. In both cases, we find that the
wavelength in the charge correlations is consistent with so-called filled

hexagonal boron phosphide monolayer (2D-h-BP). The system was deformed
isotropically by applying a simultaneous tensile strain along the a and b
crystal axes. We analyzed the band-gap evolution as function of the deformation
percentage, ranging from 1% to 8%. Results show that the system behaves as a
direct band-gap semiconductor, with the valence band maximum and conduction
band minimum located at the K point (1/3, 1/3, 0) of the Brillouin zone. This
behavior is unchanged despite the strain application. The band gap
underestimation, as computed within the standard DFT, was corrected by applying
the G0W0 approach. Trends in the band-gap behavior are the same within both
approaches: for low deformation percentages, the band-gap grows linearly with a
small slope, and at higher values, it grows very slow with a tendency to
achieve saturation. Therefore, the band-gap is less sensitive to tensile strain
for deformations near 8%. The origin of this band gap behavior is explained in
terms of the projected density of states and charge densities, and it can be
attributed to Coulomb interactions, and charge redistributions due to the
applied tensile strain. To study the carrier mobility, we computed the electron
and hole effective masses, finding high mobility for both carriers. Finally,
the stability analysis of each strained system includes the calculation of
phonon spectra, to assure the dynamical stability, the computation of elastic
constants to evaluate the mechanical stability, and cohesive energies for
exploring the thermodynamical stability. Results indicate that the boron
phosphide monolayer is stable under the calculated tensile strains.

(MILPs) is of great importance for many practical applications. In this
respect, the refinement heuristic local branching (LB) has been proposed to
produce improving solutions and has been highly influential for the development
of local search methods in MILP. The algorithm iteratively explores a sequence
of solution neighborhoods defined by the so-called local branching constraint,
namely, a linear inequality limiting the distance from a reference solution.
For a LB algorithm, the choice of the neighborhood size is critical to
performance. In this work, we study the relation between the size of the search
neighborhood and the behavior of the underlying LB algorithm, and we devise a
leaning based framework for predicting the best size for the specific instance
to be solved. Furthermore, we have also investigated the relation between the
time limit for exploring the LB neighborhood and the actual performance of LB
scheme, and devised a strategy for adapting the time limit. We computationally
show that the neighborhood size and time limit can indeed be learned, leading
to improved performances and that the overall algorithm generalizes well both

results indicate that, in general, for Ages $<$ 4 Gyr, younger open clusters

addition, metallicity segregates open clusters in the [Ce/X]-Age plane (where X

for which a known minimax defense optimizing for the worst-case attack provides
a benchmark. We derive the worst-case attack for the GLRT defense, and show
that its asymptotic performance (as the dimension of the data increases)

managers have to deal with uncertain demand, lost sales, and capacity
constraints that results in more complex feasible action spaces. Our proposed
Programmable Actor Reinforcement Learning (PARL) uses a deep-policy iteration
method that leverages neural networks (NNs) to approximate the value function
and combines it with mathematical programming (MP) and sample average
approximation (SAA) to solve the per-step-action optimally while accounting for
combinatorial action spaces and state-dependent constraint sets.
  We show how the proposed methodology can be applied to complex inventory
replenishment problems where analytical solutions are intractable. We also
benchmark the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-art RL algorithms and
commonly used replenishment heuristics and find that the proposed algorithm
considerably outperforms existing methods by as much as 14.7\% on average in

  This improvement in performance of PARL over benchmark algorithms can be
attributed to better inventory cost management, especially in inventory
constrained settings. Furthermore, in a simpler back order setting where the
optimal solution is tractable, we find that the RL based policy also converges
to the optimal policy. Finally, to make RL algorithms more accessible for

developed that can be used to test the performance of RL algorithms with

proposed to solve the linear system of equations arising from the extended

partitions the computational mesh into two types of subdomains: the regular
subdomains and the crack tip subdomains based on the observation that the crack
tips have a significant impact on the convergence of the iterative method while
the impact of the crack lines is not that different from those of regular mesh
points. The tip subdomains consist of mesh points at crack tips and all
neighboring points where the branch enrichment functions are applied. The
regular subdomains consist of all other mesh points, including those on the
crack lines. To overcome the mismatch between the number of subdomains and the
number of processor cores, the proposed method is divided into two steps: solve
the crack tip problem and then the regular subdomain problem during each
iteration. The proposed method was used to develop a parallel XFEM package
which is able to test different types of iterative methods. To achieve good
parallel efficiency, additional methods were introduced to reduce communication

architectural adaptation of the pretrained GAN to perform the conditioning. To
this end, we propose hyper-modulated generative networks that allow for shared

we introduce a self-initialization procedure that does not require any real

  Methods: A total of 1,058 EBC patients with pathologically confirmed ALN

(DL-CNB) model was built on the attention-based multiple instance-learning

extracted from the cancer areas of digitized whole-slide images (WSIs) of
breast CNB specimens annotated by two pathologists. Accuracy, sensitivity,

  Results: The best-performing DL-CNB model with VGG16_BN as the feature

Furthermore, our model incorporating the clinical data, which was called

for patients younger than 50 years (AUC: 0.918, 95%CI: 0.825, 0.971). The
interpretation of DL-CNB model showed that the top signatures most predictive

orientation ($p$ = 0.012).

have been developed and deployed using permissioned blockchain platforms
(access to network is controlled and given to only nodes with known
identities). Such blockchain platforms heavily depend on cryptography to
provide a layer of trust within the network, thus verification of cryptographic
signatures often becomes the bottleneck. The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
Algorithm (ECDSA) is the most commonly used cryptographic scheme in
permissioned blockchains. In this paper, we propose an efficient implementation
of ECDSA signature verification on an FPGA, in order to improve the performance
of permissioned blockchains that aim to use FPGA-based hardware accelerators.
  We propose several optimizations for modular arithmetic (e.g., custom
multipliers and fast modular reduction) and point arithmetic (e.g., reduced
number of point double and addition operations, and optimal width NAF
representation). Based on these optimized modular and point arithmetic modules,
we propose an ECDSA verification engine that can be used by any application for
fast verification of ECDSA signatures. We further optimize our ECDSA
verification engine for Hyperledger Fabric (one of the most widely used
permissioned blockchain platforms) by moving carefully selected operations to a
precomputation block, thus simplifying the critical path of ECDSA signature
verification. From our implementation on Xilinx Alveo U250 accelerator board
with target frequency of 250MHz, our ECDSA verification engine can perform a
single verification in $760\mu s$ resulting in a throughput of 1,315
verifications per second, which is ~2.5x faster than state-of-the-art
FPGA-based implementations. Our Hyperledger Fabric-specific ECDSA engine can
perform a single verification in $368\mu s$ with a throughput of 2,717

inference attacks (MIAs), attempting to determine whether a particular data

independently of specific MIAs, (c) which assesses susceptibility to different
MIAs, (d) can be used for different applications, and (e) efficiently. None of
the prior membership privacy risk metrics simultaneously meet all these
requirements.
  We present SHAPr, a membership privacy metric based on Shapley values which
is a leave-one-out (LOO) technique, originally intended to measure the
contribution of a training data record on model utility. We conjecture that
contribution to model utility can act as a proxy for memorization, and hence
represent membership privacy risk.
  Using ten benchmark datasets, we show that SHAPr is indeed effective in
estimating susceptibility of training data records to MIAs. We also show that,
unlike prior work, SHAPr is significantly better in estimating susceptibility
to newer, and more effective MIA. We apply SHAPr to evaluate the efficacy of
several defenses against MIAs: using regularization and removing high risk
training data records. Moreover, SHAPr is versatile: it can be used for
estimating vulnerability of different subgroups to MIAs, and inherits
applications of Shapley values (e.g., data valuation). We show that SHAPr has
an acceptable computational cost (compared to naive LOO), varying from a few
minutes for the smallest dataset to ~92 minutes for the largest dataset.

to lie at cosmological distances, through localisation to host galaxies.
Recently, an FRB-like event was seen from the Milky Way magnetar SGR 1935+2154
by the CHIME and STARE2 telescopes. This is the only magnetar that has produced
FRB events in our galaxy. Finding similar events in the Milky Way is of great
interest to understanding FRB progenitors. Such events will be strongly
affected by the turbulent interstellar medium in the Milky Way, their intrinsic
energy distribution and their spatial locations within the plane of the Milky
Way. We examine these effects using models for the distribution of electrons in
the ISM to estimate the dispersion measure and pulse scattering of mock events,
and a range of models for the spatial distribution and luminosity functions,
including models motivated by the spatial distribution of the Milky Way's
magnetars. We evaluate the fraction of FRB events in the Milky Way that are
detectable by STARE2 for a range of ISM models, spatial distributions and burst
luminosity functions. In all the models examined, only a fraction of burst
events are detectable, mainly due to the scattering effects of the ISM. We find
that GReX, a proposed all-sky experiment, could increase the detection rate of
Milky Way FRB events by an order of magnitude, depending on assumptions made
about the luminosity function and scale-height of the FRBs.

contended issue. Recently, non-local conductance signatures that exploit the
non-locality of the zero modes in three terminal hybrid setups have been
proposed as means to ascertain the definitive presence of Majorana modes. The
topological entanglement entropy, which is based on the von Neumann entropy, is
yet another way to gauge the non-locality in connection with the bulk-boundary
correspondence of a topological phase. We show that while both the entanglement
entropy and the non-local conductance exhibit a clear topological phase
transition signature for long enough pristine nanowires, non-local conductance
fails to signal a topological phase transition for shorter disordered wires.
While recent experiments have indeed shown premature gap-closure signatures in
the non-local conductance spectra, we believe that the entanglement entropy can
indeed signal a genuine transition, regardless of the constituent
non-idealities in an experimental situation. Our results thereby point toward
furthering the development of experimental techniques beyond conductance

loss function for pansharpening by taking into account the following
double-type structures, \emph{i.e.,} double-level, double-branch, and
double-direction, called as triple-double network (TDNet). By using the
structure of TDNet, the spatial details of the panchromatic image can be fully
exploited and utilized to progressively inject into the low spatial resolution
multispectral image, thus yielding the high spatial resolution output. The
specific network design is motivated by the physical formula of the traditional
multi-resolution analysis (MRA) methods. Hence, an effective MRA fusion module
is also integrated into the TDNet. Besides, we adopt a few ResNet blocks and
some multi-scale convolution kernels to deepen and widen the network to
effectively enhance the feature extraction and the robustness of the proposed
TDNet. Extensive experiments on reduced- and full-resolution datasets acquired

how the quality of patches in existing vulnerability databases is. Further,
existing manual or heuristic-based approaches for patch identification are

To address these problems, we first conduct an empirical study to understand

dimensions, i.e., the coverage, consistency, type, cardinality and accuracy of

Our key idea is that patch commits will be frequently referenced during the

evaluation has indicated that i) TRACER finds patches for up to 273.8% more
CVEs than existing heuristic-based approaches while achieving a significantly
higher F1-score by up to 116.8%; and ii) TRACER achieves a higher recall by up

the nightside distortion of the TPA. SuperDARN also found ionospheric flows
typically associated with Tail Reconnection during IMF Northward Non-substorm

tackling this problem is to leverage a powerful vision-language (""cross-modal"")
decoder to fuse features independently extracted from a vision encoder and a
language encoder. Recent methods have made remarkable advancements in this
paradigm by exploiting Transformers as cross-modal decoders, concurrent to the
Transformer's overwhelming success in many other vision-language tasks.
Adopting a different approach in this work, we show that significantly better
cross-modal alignments can be achieved through the early fusion of linguistic
and visual features in intermediate layers of a vision Transformer encoder
network. By conducting cross-modal feature fusion in the visual feature
encoding stage, we can leverage the well-proven correlation modeling power of a
Transformer encoder for excavating helpful multi-modal context. This way,
accurate segmentation results are readily harvested with a light-weight mask
predictor. Without bells and whistles, our method surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art methods on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref by large margins.

takes into account the detrimental aspects of multiple reflections by
incorporating multiple contacts, multiple current measurements and suitably
defined magnetoresistance signals. Our analysis provides a direct mapping
between the magnetoresistance signals and the tunneling times and aligns well
with the interpretation in terms of generalized quantum measurements and
quantum weak values. By means of an engineered pre-selection in one of the
ferromagnetic contacts, we also elucidate how one can make the measurement
""weak"" by minimizing the back-action, while keeping the tunneling time
unchanged. We then analyze the resulting interpretations of the tunneling time
and the measurement back action in the presence of phase breaking effects that
are intrinsic to solid state systems. We unravel that while the time-keeping
aspect of the Larmor clock is reasonably undeterred due to momentum and phase
relaxation processes, it degrades significantly in the presence of
spin-dephasing. We believe that the ideas presented here also open up a
fructuous solid state platform to encompass emerging ideas in quantum

channels between subnetworks of different modalities. Specifically, the channel
exchanging process is self-guided by individual channel importance that is
measured by the magnitude of Batch-Normalization (BN) scaling factor during
training. For the application of dense image prediction, the validity of CEN is
tested by four different scenarios: multimodal fusion, cycle multimodal fusion,
multitask learning, and multimodal multitask learning. Extensive experiments on
semantic segmentation via RGB-D data and image translation through multi-domain

general N-partite information ($I^{N}$) and quantum correlation of a
topologically ordered ground state remains unknown. In this work, we study such
$I^N$ measure and its nontrivial dependence on the arrangement of $N$

structure, the $I^{N}$ measure ($N\geq 3$) is a topological invariant equal to
the product of $S_{topo}$ and the Euler characteristic of the CSS embedded on a
planar manifold, $|I^{N}|=\chi S_{topo}$. Importantly, we establish that
$I^{N}$ is robust against several deformations of the annular CSS, such as the
addition of holes within individual subsystems and handles between
nearest-neighbour subsystems. For a general CSS with multiple holes
($n_{h}>1$), we find that the sum of the distinct, multipartite informations
measured on the annular CSS around those holes is given by the product of
$S_{topo}$, $\chi$ and $n_{h}$,
$\sum^{n_{h}}_{\mu_{i}=1}|I^{N_{\mu_{i}}}_{\mu_{i}}| = n_{h}\chi S_{topo}$. The
$N^{th}$ order irreducible quantum correlations for an annular CSS of $N$
subsystems is also found to be bounded from above by $|I^{N}|$, which shows the

inherent robustness and regularization properties and provides a means to
progressively increase the complexity of the learning model i.e. the number of

convolution networks (GCNs) and self-attention mechanism with deep time series
models (e.g. recurrent neural networks) to capture the spatio-temporal
correlations separately, ignoring the relationships across time and space.
Besides, GCNs are limited by over-smoothing issue and self-attention is limited
by quadratic problem, result in GCNs lack global representation capabilities,
and self-attention inefficiently capture the global spatial dependence. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning model for traffic forecasting, named
Multi-Context Aware Spatio-Temporal Joint Linear Attention (STJLA), which
applies linear attention to the spatio-temporal joint graph to capture global
dependence between all spatio-temporal nodes efficiently. More specifically,
STJLA utilizes static structural context and dynamic semantic context to
improve model performance. The static structure context based on node2vec and
one-hot encoding enriches the spatio-temporal position information.
Furthermore, the multi-head diffusion convolution network based dynamic spatial
context enhances the local spatial perception ability, and the GRU based
dynamic temporal context stabilizes sequence position information of the linear
attention, respectively. Experiments on two real-world traffic datasets,
England and PEMSD7, demonstrate that our STJLA can achieve up to 9.83% and
3.08% accuracy improvement in MAE measure over state-of-the-art baselines.

computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic multi-graph
convolution recurrent network (DMGCRN) to tackle above issues, which can model
the spatial correlations of distance, the spatial correlations of structure,
and the temporal correlations simultaneously. We not only use the
distance-based graph to capture spatial information from nodes are close in
distance but also construct a novel latent graph which encoded the structure
correlations among roads to capture spatial information from nodes are similar
in structure. Furthermore, we divide the neighbors of each sensor into
coarse-grained regions, and dynamically assign different weights to each region
at different times. Meanwhile, we integrate the dynamic multi-graph convolution
network into the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to capture temporal dependence.
Extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our
proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

players dynamically prepare and revise their actions in advance before a
deadline when payoffs are realized. It is at the cutting edge of dynamic game
theory and can be applied in many real-world scenarios, such as eBay auction,
stock market, election, online games, crowdsourcing, etc. In this work, we
novelly identify a class of strategies for revision games which are called
Limited Retaliation strategies. An limited retaliation strategy stipulates
that, (1) players first follow a recommended cooperative plan; (2) if anyone
deviates from the plan, the limited retaliation player retaliates by using the
defection action for a limited duration; (3) after the retaliation, the limited
retaliation player returns to the cooperative plan. A limited retaliation
strategy has three key features. It is cooperative, sustaining a high level of
social welfare. It is vengeful, deterring the opponent from betrayal by
threatening with a future retaliation. It is yet forgiving, since it resumes
cooperation after a proper retaliation. The cooperativeness and vengefulness
make it constitute cooperative subgame perfect equilibrium, while the
forgiveness makes it tolerate occasional mistakes. limited retaliation
strategies show significant advantages over Grim Trigger, which is currently
the only known strategy for revision games. Besides its contribution as a new
robust and welfare-optimizing equilibrium strategy, our results about limited
retaliation strategy can also be used to explain how easy cooperation can
happen, and why forgiveness emerges in real-world multi-agent interactions. In
addition, limited retaliation strategies are simple to derive and
computationally efficient, making it easy for algorithm design and
implementation in many multi-agent systems.

We propose a new physical-layer secret key generation approach with channel
obfuscation, which improves the dynamic property of channel parameters based on
random filtering and random antenna scheduling. Our approach makes one party
obfuscate the channel to allow the legitimate party to obtain similar dynamic
channel parameters yet prevents a third party from inferring the obfuscation

obfuscated channel parameters by a joint design of the K-L transform and
adaptive quantization. A testbed implementation shows that our approach,
compared to the existing ones that we evaluate, performs the best in generating
high entropy bits at a fast rate and a high-security level in slowly varying

secret bit generation rate at about $67$ bit/pkt, and the key sequences can

has received more and more attention. In this scenario, each occasional group

The recent proposed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which incorporate the

the embedding quality of the high-order neighbors with few interactions.
Motivated by the Self-supervised Learning technique, which is able to find the

learning framework, which takes the user/item/group embedding reconstruction as
the pretext task to enhance the embeddings of the cold-start
users/items/groups. In order to explicitly enhance the high-order cold-start
neighbors' embedding quality, we further introduce an embedding enhancer, which
leverages the self-attention mechanism to improve the embedding quality for

The
recent self-supervised learning (SSL) on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model,

has shown great potential for cold-start recommendation. However, due to the
over-smoothing problem, PT-GNN can only capture up to 3-order relation, which
can not provide much useful auxiliary information to depict the target
cold-start user or item. Besides, the embedding reconstruction task only
considers the intra-correlations within the subgraph of users and items, while
ignoring the inter-correlations across different subgraphs. To solve the above
challenges, we propose a multi-strategy based pre-training method for
cold-start recommendation (MPT), which extends PT-GNN from the perspective of
model architecture and pretext tasks to improve the cold-start recommendation
performance. Specifically, in terms of the model architecture, in addition to
the short-range dependencies of users and items captured by the GNN encoder, we
introduce a Transformer encoder to capture long-range dependencies. In terms of
the pretext task, in addition to considering the intra-correlations of users
and items by the embedding reconstruction task, we add embedding contrastive
learning task to capture inter-correlations of users and items. We train the
GNN and Transformer encoders on these pretext tasks under the meta-learning
setting to simulate the real cold-start scenario, making the model easily and
rapidly being adapted to new cold-start users and items. Experiments on three

Most existing methods directly inject the TIR modality into the RGB-based

generally have modality-specific noise, which might worsen the features along
with the propagation of the network. Therefore, this work proposes an effective

devised to distill the informative features and recalibrate the representations
asymptotically. Concretely, a bi-direction multi-stage fusion strategy is
adopted to progressively optimize features of two modalities and retain their

BAA-Gate is introduced by the illumination-based weighting strategy to
adaptively adjust the recalibrating and aggregating strength in the BAA-Gate

uncertainty than the data. The cost is only marginally larger than averaging
each plane before correlating, but the improvement in signal-to-noise can be
substantial. We test the method on correlators of the gradient-flowed
topological charge density and squared field strength, finding noise reductions
by a factor of $\sim$ 3$-$7 compared to the conventional approach on the same

that both scoring and thresholding models are included as important components

Mercer kernels, our first-order algorithm has been extended to deal with

  Full-Duplex Systems","Accepted by TWC",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)
assisted multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) full-duplex (FD)
system. We jointly optimize the active beamforming matrices at the access point
(AP) and uplink users, and the passive beamforming matrix at the IRS to
maximize the weighted sum-rate of the system. Since it is practically difficult
to acquire the channel state information (CSI) for IRS-related links due to its
passive operation and large number of elements, we conceive a mixed-timescale
beamforming scheme. Specifically, the high-dimensional passive beamforming
matrix at the IRS is updated based on the channel statistics while the active
beamforming matrices are optimized relied on the low-dimensional real-time
effective CSI at each time slot. We propose an efficient stochastic successive
convex approximation (SSCA)-based algorithm for jointly designing the active
and passive beamforming matrices. Moreover, due to the high computational
complexity caused by the matrix inversion computation in the SSCA-based
optimization algorithm, we further develop a deep-unfolding neural network (NN)
to address this issue. The proposed deep-unfolding NN maintains the structure
of the SSCA-based algorithm but introduces a novel non-linear activation
function and some learnable parameters induced by the first-order Taylor
expansion to approximate the matrix inversion. In addition, we develop a
black-box NN as a benchmark. Simulation results show that the proposed
mixed-timescale algorithm outperforms the existing single-timescale algorithm
and the proposed deep-unfolding NN approaches the performance of the SSCA-based
algorithm with much reduced computational complexity when deployed online.

fundamental challenges at the interface of network science and logistics. Given
the multitude of performance criteria, real-world constraints, and external
influences acting upon such a system, even formulating an appropriate research
question to address this topic is non-trivial.
  Here we present an abstraction of a supply and distribution system leading to
a minimal model, which only retains stylized facts of the systemic function
and, in this way, allows us to investigate the generic properties of robust
supply networks. On this level of abstraction, a supply and distribution system
is the strategic use of transportation to eliminate mismatches between
production patterns (i.e., the amounts of goods produced at each production
site of a company) and demand patterns (i.e., the amount of goods consumed at
each location). When creating networks based on this paradigm and furthermore
requiring the robustness of the system with respect to the loss of
transportation routes (edge of the network) we see that robust networks are
built from specific sets of subgraphs, while vulnerable networks display a
markedly different subgraph composition.
  Our findings confirm a long-standing hypothesis in the field of network
science, namely, that network motifs -- statistically over-represented small
subgraphs -- are informative about the robust functioning of a network. Also,
our findings offer a blueprint for enhancing the robustness of real-world
supply and distribution systems.

dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted increasing attention for their potential
in enabling distinct functionalities in the same material for making integrated
devices. Electron-injection to TMDs has been proved to be a feasible way to
drive structural phase transition from the semiconducting H-phase to the
semimetal dT-phase. In this contribution, based on density-functional theory
(DFT) calculations, firstly we demonstrate that hole-injection drives the
transition of the H-phase more efficiently to the metallic T-phase than to the
semimetallic dT-phase for group VI-B TMDs (MoS2, WS2, and MoSe2, etc.). The
origin can be attributed to the smaller work function of the T-phase than that
of the dT-phase. Our work function analysis can distinguish the T and dT phases
quantitatively while it is challenging for the commonly used crystal field
splitting analysis. In addition, our analysis provides a unified understanding
for both hole- and electron-injection induced phase transitions for 2D
materials beyond TMDs, such as the newly synthesized MoSi2N4 family. Moreover,
the hole-driven T-phase transition mechanism can explain the recent experiment
of WS2 phase transition by hole-doping with yttrium (Y) atoms. Using 1/3
Y-doped WS2 and MoSe2 as examples, we show that the Mo and W valency increases
to 5+. These above findings open up an avenue to obtain the metallic T-phase,
which expands the possible stable phases of 2D materials.

band. Strikingly, the topologically protected Fermi-arc states directly connect
the unpaired TDP with additional WPs, in contrast to the conventional Fermi-arc
states that connect the same degeneracies of band degenerate points with
opposite chirality. Furthermore, the different types of TDPs with unique

enables to decrease the interference brought by the highly frequency-selective
channels as the number of base station (BS) antennas increases. However,
existing works show that there remains residual interference after single-tap
equalization even with infinite number of BS antennas, leading to a limitation
of achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) performance. In
this paper, we propose a two-stage design scheme of equalizers to remove the
above limitation. In the first stage, we design high-rate equalizers working
before FBMC demodulation to avoid the potential loss of channel information
obtained at the BS. In the second stage, we transform the high-rate equalizers
into the low-rate equalizers after FBMC demodulation to reduce the
implementation complexity. Compared with prior works, the proposed scheme has
affordable complexity under massive MIMO and only requires instantaneous
channel state information (CSI) without statistical CSI and additional
equalizers. Simulation results show that the scheme can bring improved SINR
performance. Moreover, even with finite number of BS antennas, the interference
brought by the channels can be almost eliminated.

testing, we create a semi-synthetic large test-bench (363 templates, 363k

individually test and analyze reasoning capabilities along 17 reasoning
dimensions (including pragmatic reasoning), 2) design experiments to study
cross-capability information content (leave one out or bring one in); and 3)
the synthetic nature enable us to control for artifacts and biases. The
inherited power of automated test case instantiation from free-form natural
language templates (using CheckList), and a well-defined taxonomy of
capabilities enable us to extend to (cognitively) harder test cases while
varying the complexity of natural language. Through our analysis of
state-of-the-art NLI systems, we observe that our benchmark is indeed hard (and
non-trivial even with training on additional resources). Some capabilities
stand out as harder. Further fine-grained analysis and fine-tuning experiments
reveal more insights about these capabilities and the models -- supporting and
extending previous observations. Towards the end we also perform an user-study,
to investigate whether behavioral information can be utilised to generalize
much better for some models compared to others.

a traffic network, namely efficient pressure (EP); (2) build a traffic signal

the traffic state; and (4) develop a general RL-based TSC algorithm template:
efficient Xlight (Efficient-XLight) under EP. Through comprehensive experiments
on multiple real-world datasets in our traffic signal settings' protocol for

To address this issue, the authors pose and address a more general optimization
problem, namely by assuming the consumer's utility to be sigmoidal and in a
given class of functions. The considered class of functions is very attractive
for at least two reasons. First, the classical NP-hardness issue associated
with sum-utility maximization is circumvented. Second, the considered class of
functions encompasses well-known performance metrics used to analyze the
problems of pricing and energy-efficiency. This allows one to design a new and
optimal inclining block rates (IBR) pricing policy which also has the virtue of
flattening the power consumption and reducing the peak power. We also show how

search problem within a valid depth range. Recent deep learning-based MVS
methods typically densely sample depth hypotheses in the depth range, and then
construct prohibitively memory-consuming 3D cost volumes for depth prediction.
Although coarse-to-fine sampling strategies alleviate this overhead issue to a
certain extent, the efficiency of MVS is still an open challenge. In this work,
we propose a novel method for highly efficient MVS that remarkably decreases
the memory footprint, meanwhile clearly advancing state-of-the-art depth
prediction performance. We investigate what a search strategy can be reasonably
optimal for MVS taking into account of both efficiency and effectiveness. We
first formulate MVS as a binary search problem, and accordingly propose a
generalized binary search network for MVS. Specifically, in each step, the
depth range is split into 2 bins with extra 1 error tolerance bin on both
sides. A classification is performed to identify which bin contains the true
depth. We also design three mechanisms to respectively handle classification
errors, deal with out-of-range samples and decrease the training memory. The
new formulation makes our method only sample a very small number of depth
hypotheses in each step, which is highly memory efficient, and also greatly
facilitates quick training convergence. Experiments on competitive benchmarks
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much less memory.
Particularly, our method obtains an overall score of 0.289 on DTU dataset and
tops the first place on challenging Tanks and Temples advanced dataset among
all the learning-based methods. The trained models and code will be released at

towards artificial general intelligence. This requires the agent to
continuously learn and memorize new knowledge without interference. This paper
first demonstrates a fundamental issue of lifelong learning using neural
networks, named anterograde forgetting, i.e., preserving and transferring
memory may inhibit the learning of new knowledge. This is attributed to the
fact that the learning capacity of a neural network will be reduced as it keeps
memorizing historical knowledge, and the fact that conceptual confusion may
occur as it transfers irrelevant old knowledge to the current task. This work
proposes a general framework named Cycled Memory Networks (CMN) to address the
anterograde forgetting in neural networks for lifelong learning. The CMN
consists of two individual memory networks to store short-term and long-term
memories to avoid capacity shrinkage. A transfer cell is designed to connect
these two memory networks, enabling knowledge transfer from the long-term
memory network to the short-term memory network to mitigate the conceptual
confusion, and a memory consolidation mechanism is developed to integrate
short-term knowledge into the long-term memory network for knowledge
accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the CMN can effectively
address the anterograde forgetting on several task-related, task-conflict,
class-incremental and cross-domain benchmarks.

trainable inference operators have been shown to achieve favorable

LUTNet, exhibited state-of-the-art performance for standard DNN benchmarks. In
this paper, we propose the learned optimization of such LUT-based topologies,
resulting in higher-efficiency designs than via the direct use of
off-the-shelf, hand-designed networks. Existing implementations of this class
of architecture require the manual specification of the number of inputs per
LUT, K. Choosing appropriate K a priori is challenging, and doing so at even
high granularity, e.g. per layer, is a time-consuming and error-prone process
that leaves FPGAs' spatial flexibility underexploited. Furthermore, prior works
see LUT inputs connected randomly, which does not guarantee a good choice of
network topology. To address these issues, we propose logic shrinkage, a
fine-grained netlist pruning methodology enabling K to be automatically learned
for every LUT in a neural network targeted for FPGA inference. By removing LUT
inputs determined to be of low importance, our method increases the efficiency
of the resultant accelerators. Our GPU-friendly solution to LUT input removal
is capable of processing large topologies during their training with negligible
slowdown. With logic shrinkage, we better the area and energy efficiency of the
best-performing LUTNet implementation of the CNV network classifying CIFAR-10
by 1.54x and 1.31x, respectively, while matching its accuracy. This
implementation also reaches 2.71x the area efficiency of an equally accurate,
heavily pruned BNN. On ImageNet with the Bi-Real Net architecture, employment
of logic shrinkage results in a post-synthesis area reduction of 2.67x vs
LUTNet, allowing for implementation that was previously impossible on today's

language that can facilitate the translation of ideas and methods between
disparate contexts. The focus is on questions of ""resource-theoretic nature"".
In a resource theory, one identifies resources and allowed manipulations that
can be used to transform them. Some of the main questions are: How to optimize
resources? What are the trade-offs between them? Can a given resource be
converted to another one via the allowed manipulations?
  Because of their ubiquity, methods used to answer them in one context can be
used to tackle corresponding questions in new contexts. The translation occurs
in two stages. Firstly, methods are generalized to the abstract language. Then,
one can determine whether potentially novel contexts can accommodate them.
  We focus on the first stage, by introducing two variants of an abstract
framework in which existing and yet unidentified resource theories can be
represented. Using these, the task of generalizing concrete methods is tackled
in chapter 4 by studying the ways in which meaningful measures of resources may
be constructed.
  One construction expresses a notion of cost (or yield) of a resource. Among
other applications, it may be used to extend measures from a subset of
resources to a larger domain.
  Another construction allows the translation of resource measures from one
resource theory to another. Special cases include resource robustness and
weight measures, as well as relative entropy based measures quantifying minimal
distinguishability from freely available resources.
  We instantiate some of these ideas in a resource theory of distinguishability
in chapter 5. It describes the utility of systems with probabilistic behavior
for the task of distinguishing between hypotheses, which said behavior may
depend on.

hierarchical classification by decoupling it into several multi-class

of encoding the correlation embedded in class hierarchies. We further propose a
confusion loss, which encourages the classification network to learn the
correlation across different label hierarchies during training. The proposed

modifications. We experiment with three public benchmark datasets with various

to make better predictions for test instances from a different distribution
than the source. Crucially, TTA assumes no access to the source data or even
any additional labeled/unlabeled samples from the target distribution to
finetune the source model. In this work, we consider TTA in a more pragmatic
setting which we refer to as SITA (Single Image Test-time Adaptation). Here,
when making a prediction, the model has access only to the given single test
instance, rather than a batch of instances, as typically been considered in the
literature. This is motivated by the realistic scenarios where inference is
needed on-demand instead of delaying for an incoming batch or the inference is
happening on an edge device (like mobile phone) where there is no scope for
batching. The entire adaptation process in SITA should be extremely fast as it
happens at inference time. To address this, we propose a novel approach AugBN
that requires only a single forward pass. It can be used on any off-the-shelf
trained model to test single instances for both classification and segmentation
tasks. AugBN estimates normalization statistics of the unseen test distribution
from the given test image using only one forward pass with label-preserving
transformations. Since AugBN does not involve any back-propagation, it is
significantly faster compared to recent test time adaptation methods. We
further extend AugBN to make the algorithm hyperparameter-free. Rigorous
experimentation show that our simple algorithm is able to achieve significant

human-like mechanical compliance due to low loop gain, tolerance of time

Its outstanding feature is that it uses feedback of multisensory disturbance

proof-of-principle tests in 1 and 2 DOF posture control robots, we present here
a generalized DEC control module for multi-DOF robots. In the control layout,
one DEC module controls one DOF (modular control architecture). Modules of
neighboring joints are synergistically interconnected using vestibular
information in combination with joint angle and torque signals. These sensory
interconnections allow each module to control the kinematics of the more distal
links as if they were a single link. This modular design makes the complexity
of the robot control scale linearly with the DOFs and error robustness high

curvature. The degeneracy among spatial curvature, cosmological constant and
cosmological contortion distribution makes the model viable in describing the
known observation date. We get some constraints on the spatial curvature by the
comparison of the relation between measured distance modulus and red-shift with
the predicted one, the evolution of matter density over time and the evolution
of effective cosmological constant. The performance of large scale Lorentz
violation model with non-vanishing spatial curvature under these constrains is
discussed.

  Improving Financial Inclusion","Accepted at AAAI-22",,,,"cs.LG q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The prosperity of mobile and financial technologies has bred and expanded
various kinds of financial products to a broader scope of people, which
contributes to advocating financial inclusion. It has non-trivial social
benefits of diminishing financial inequality. However, the technical challenges
in individual financial risk evaluation caused by the distinct characteristic
distribution and limited credit history of new users, as well as the
inexperience of newly-entered companies in handling complex data and obtaining
accurate labels, impede further promoting financial inclusion. To tackle these
challenges, this paper develops a novel transfer learning algorithm (i.e.,
TransBoost) that combines the merits of tree-based models and kernel methods.
The TransBoost is designed with a parallel tree structure and efficient weights
updating mechanism with theoretical guarantee, which enables it to excel in
tackling real-world data with high dimensional features and sparsity in $O(n)$
time complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets and a
unique large-scale dataset from Tencent Mobile Payment. The results show that
the TransBoost outperforms other state-of-the-art benchmark transfer learning
algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy with superior efficiency, shows
stronger robustness to data sparsity, and provides meaningful model
interpretation. Besides, given a financial risk level, the TransBoost enables
financial service providers to serve the largest number of users including
those who would otherwise be excluded by other algorithms. That is, the
TransBoost improves financial inclusion.

computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of double stenosed artery models involves
time and effort, restricting physicians' ability to respond quickly in
time-critical medical applications. Such issues might be addressed by training
deep learning (DL) models to learn and predict blood flow characteristics using
a dataset generated by CFD simulations of simplified double stenosed artery
models with different configurations. When blood flow patterns are compared
through an actual double stenosed artery model, derived from IVUS imaging, it
is revealed that the sinusoidal approximation of stenosed neck geometry, which
has been widely used in previous research works, fails to effectively represent
the effects of a real constriction. As a result, a novel geometric
representation of the constricted neck is proposed which, in terms of a
generalized simplified model, outperforms the former assumption. The sequential
change in artery lumen diameter and flow parameters along the length of the
vessel presented opportunities for the use of LSTM and GRU DL models. However,
with the small dataset of short lengths of doubly constricted blood arteries,
the basic neural network model outperforms the specialized RNNs for most flow
properties. LSTM, on the other hand, performs better for predicting flow
properties with large fluctuations, such as varying blood pressure over the
length of the vessels. Despite having good overall accuracies in training and
testing across all the properties for the vessels in the dataset, the GRU model
underperforms for an individual vessel flow prediction in all cases. The
results also point to the need of individually optimized hyperparameters for
each property in any model rather than aiming to achieve overall good
performance across all outputs with a single set of hyperparameters.

not identical structures. The method transforms general DCMs to rigorously
periodic arrays by replacing each coding unit with the macro unit, which
comprises all possible coding states. The system matrix corresponding to the
rigorously periodic array is globally shared for DCMs with arbitrary codebooks
via implicit retrieval. The discrepancy of the interactions for edge and corner
units are precluded by the basis extension of periodic boundaries. Moreover,
the hierarchical pattern exploitation (HPE) algorithm is leveraged to
efficiently assemble the system matrix for further acceleration. Due to the
fully utilization of the rigid periodicity, the computational complexity of
R3M-HPE is theoretically lower than that of $\mathcal{H}$-matrix within the
same paradigm. Numerical results for two types of DCMs indicate that R3M-HPE is
accurate in comparison with commercial software. Besides, R3M-HPE is also
compatible with the preconditioning for efficient iterative solutions. The
efficiency of R3M-HPE for DCMs outperforms the conventional fast algorithms in

weakly $2$-absorbing) ideals was introduced and examined by Al-Zoubi,
Abu-Dawwas and \c{C}eken (Hacettepe Journal of Mathematics and Statistics, 48
(3) (2019), 724-731) as a generalization of the concept of graded prime (graded
weakly prime) ideals. Up to now, research on these topics mainly concentrated
on commutative graded rings. On the other hand, graded prime ideals over
non-commutative graded rings have been introduced and examined by Abu-Dawwas,
Bataineh and Al-Muanger (Vietnam Journal of Mathematics, 46 (3) (2018),
681-692). As a generalization of graded prime ideals over non-commutative
graded rings, the concept of graded $2$-absorbing ideals over non-commutative
graded rings has been introduced and investigated by Abu-Dawwas, Shashan and
Dagher (WSEAS Transactions on Mathematics, 19 (2020), 232-238). Recently,
graded weakly prime ideals over non-commutative graded rings have been
introduced and studied by Alshehry and Abu-Dawwas (Communications in Algebra,
49 (11) (2021), 4712-4723). In this article, we introduce and study the concept
of graded weakly $2$-absorbing ideals as a generalization of graded weakly
prime ideals in a non-commutative graded ring, and show that many of the
results in commutative graded rings also hold in non-commutative graded rings.

teacher model to a small student model with great improvements of the
performance of the student model. Therefore, the student network can replace
the teacher network to deploy on low-resource devices since the higher
performance, lower number of parameters and shorter inference time.
Self-knowledge distillation (SKD) attracts a great attention recently that a
student model itself is a teacher model distilling knowledge from. To the best
of our knowledge, self knowledge distillation can be divided into two main
streams: data augmentation and refined knowledge auxiliary. In this paper, we
purpose a novel SKD method in a different way from the main stream methods. Our
method distills knowledge from multilevel abstraction features. Experiments and
ablation studies show its great effectiveness and generalization on various
kinds of tasks with various kinds of model structures. Our codes have been
released on GitHub.

  work. An updated version will be reposted later",,,,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  An elementary introduction to knot theory and its link to quantum field
theory is presented with an intention to provide details of some basic
calculations in the subject, which are not easily found in texts. Study of
Chern-Simons theory with gauge group $\mathcal{G}$, along with the Wilson lines
carrying some representation is explained in generality, and a vital
calculation of the Chern-Simons propagator is done. Explicit calculation for
$U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory is presented, which leads to the topological
invariants, and finally to knot invariants. Further, using this result along
with the Gauss linking number formula, the expectation value of Wilson loops
are calculated. Colored knot invariants are also discussed along with more
advanced knot invariants which are obtained using Homology theory, i.e.,
categorification of Jones and HOMFLY polynomials. Various knot invariants for
$SU(N)$ gauge group are also introduced, along with a brief introduction to
A-polynomials and super A-polynomials. Recent developments in the field are
explored, and we discuss a conjectured formula for colored superpolynomials,
closed-form expression for HOMFLY polynomials, and conjectured expression for
$6j$ symbol for $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_N)$ for multiplicity free case. Also, a
MATHEMATICA program based on the conjectured formula had been developed, which
can compute the $6j$-symbols and the desired duality matrices which are needed
to use the closed-form expression for HOMFLY polynomials.

  Edge Computing Network",,,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  To support the newly introduced multimedia services with ultra-low latency
and extensive computation requirements, resource-constrained end user devices
should utilize the ubiquitous computing resources available at network edge for
augmenting on-board (local) processing with edge computing. In this regard, the
capability of cell-free massive MIMO to provide reliable access links by
guaranteeing uniform quality of service without cell edge can be exploited for
seamless parallel processing. Taking this into account, we consider a cell-free
massive MIMO-enabled mobile edge network to meet the stringent requirements of
the advanced services. For the considered mobile edge network, we formulate a
joint communication and computing resource allocation (JCCRA) problem with the
objective of minimizing energy consumption of the users while meeting the tight
delay constraints. We then propose a fully distributed cooperative solution
approach based on multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)
algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the
proposed distributed approach has converged to that of a centralized deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based target benchmark, while alleviating
the large overhead associated with the latter. Furthermore, it has been shown
that our approach significantly outperforms heuristic baselines in terms of
energy efficiency, roughly up to 5 times less total energy consumption.
