  This work shows how to efficiently apply vector clocks for dynamic data race

FastRacer, builds on the FastTrack algorithm with per-task and per-variable
optimizations to reduce the size of vector clocks. FastRacer exploits the
structured parallelism of async-finish programs to use a coarse-grained
encoding of the dynamic task inheritance relations to limit the metadata in the

substantially improves time and space overheads over FastTrack, and is

decouples the computation of the phase field variable, the velocity and

significantly reduces the computational cost. The energy stability of the

the features of two-phase flows in the coupled free flow and porous media

method of the polarized radiative transfer equation with magneto-hydrostatic
(MHS) constraints to infer the magnetic field vector in the three-dimensional

then apply Ampere's law to determine the electric currents, ${\bf j}$, from the

electric currents present in the original MHD simulation. We show that the
method employed here is able to attain reasonable reliability (close to 50 % of
the cases are within a factor of two, and this increases to 60 %-70 % for
pixels with $B\ge300$ G) in the inference of electric currents for low
atmospheric heights (optical depths at 500 nm $\tau_{5}\in$[1,0.1]) regardless
of whether a small or large number of spectral lines are inverted. Above these
photospheric layers, the method's accuracy strongly deteriorates as magnetic
fields become weaker and as the MHS approximation becomes less accurate. We
also find that the inferred electric currents have a floor value that is
related to low-magnetized plasma, where the uncertainty in the magnetic field
inference prevents a sufficiently accurate determination of the spatial
derivatives. We present a method that allows the inference of the three
components of the electric current vector at deep atmospheric layers

It is important to estimate a proper grasping pose for each fruit before

proposed to perform end-to-end instance segmentation and grasping estimation
using both color and geometry sensory data from a RGB-D camera. Besides,
workspace geometry modelling is applied to assist the robotic manipulation.
Moreover, we implement a global-to-local scanning strategy, which enables
robots to accurately recognise and retrieve fruits in field environments with
two consumer-level RGB-D cameras. We also evaluate the accuracy and robustness
of proposed network comprehensively in experiments. The experimental results
show that A3N achieves 0.873 on instance segmentation accuracy, with an average

representations that could rival ones from full supervision, and have been
shown to be beneficial to the model in several ways: for example improving
models robustness and out-of-distribution detection. In our paper, we conduct
an empirical study to understand more precisely in what way can self-supervised
learning - as a pre-training technique or part of adversarial training -
affects model robustness to $l_2$ and $l_{\infty}$ adversarial perturbations
and natural image corruptions. Self-supervision can indeed improve model
robustness, however it turns out the devil is in the details. If one simply
adds self-supervision loss in tandem with adversarial training, then one sees
improvement in accuracy of the model when evaluated with adversarial
perturbations smaller or comparable to the value of $\epsilon_{train}$ that the
robust model is trained with. However, if one observes the accuracy for
$\epsilon_{test} \ge \epsilon_{train}$, the model accuracy drops. In fact, the
larger the weight of the supervision loss, the larger the drop in performance,
i.e. harming the robustness of the model. We identify primary ways in which
self-supervision can be added to adversarial training, and observe that using a
self-supervised loss to optimize both network parameters and find adversarial
examples leads to the strongest improvement in model robustness, as this can be
viewed as a form of ensemble adversarial training. Although self-supervised
pre-training yields benefits in improving adversarial training as compared to
random weight initialization, we observe no benefit in model robustness or

quickly expanded in the medical and wellness fields. At rest, automatic
detection of vital parameters is generally accurate. However, in conditions
such as high-intensity exercise, sudden physiological changes occur to the
signals, compromising the robustness of standard algorithms. Methods: Our
method, called BayeSlope, is based on unsupervised learning, Bayesian
filtering, and non-linear normalization to enhance and correctly detect the R
peaks according to their expected positions in the ECG. Furthermore, as
BayeSlope is computationally heavy and can drain the device battery quickly, we
propose an online design that adapts its robustness to sudden physiological
changes, and its complexity to the heterogeneous resources of modern embedded
platforms. This method combines BayeSlope with a lightweight algorithm,
executed in cores with different capabilities, to reduce the energy consumption
while preserving the accuracy. Results: BayeSlope achieves an F1 score of 99.3%

the online adaptive process achieves an F1 score of 99% across five different

the use of proper intrinsic states. Various types of intrinsic states are

Energy spectra are generated via configuration-iteraction calculations in the

understanding of opinion evolution, a.k.a. opinion dynamics, is especially
important. Linear graph-based dynamics and bounded confidence dynamics are the
two most popular models for opinion dynamics in social networks. Recently,
stochastic bounded confidence opinion dynamics were proposed as a general
framework that incorporates both these dynamics as special cases and also
captures the inherent stochasticity and noise (errors) in real-life social
exchanges. Although these dynamics are quite general and realistic, their
analysis is particularly challenging compared to other opinion dynamics models.
This is because these dynamics are nonlinear and stochastic, and belong to the
class of Markov processes that have asymptotically zero drift and unbounded
jumps. The asymptotic behavior of these dynamics was characterized in prior
works. However, they do not shed light on their finite-time behavior, which is
often of interest in practice. We take a stride in this direction by analyzing
the finite time behavior of a two-agent system, which is fundamental to the
understanding of multi-agent dynamics. In particular, we show that the opinion
difference between the two agents is well concentrated around zero under the
conditions that lead to asymptotic stability of the dynamics.

controlled beam-splitter (cBS) and from this a cSWAP. The strongly biased error
channel for the Kerr-cat has phase flips which dominate over bit flips. This
yields important benefits for the cSWAP gate which becomes non-destructive and

  Composite Fading Mixed Multicast Channels: A Secrecy Tradeoff",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The secrecy performance of realistic wireless multicast scenarios can be
significantly deteriorated by the simultaneous occurrence of multipath and
shadowing. To resolve this security threat, in this work an opportunistic
relaying-based dual-hop wireless multicast framework is proposed in which the
source dispatches confidential information to a bunch of receivers via
intermediate relays under the wiretapping attempts of multiple eavesdroppers.
Two scenarios, i.e. non-line of sight (NLOS) and line of sight (LOS)
communications along with the multiplicative and LOS shadowing are considered
where the first scenario assumes eta-mu and eta-mu/inverse Gamma (IG) composite
fading channels and the latter one follows kappa-mu and kappa-mu/IG composite
fading channels as the source to relay and relay to receiver's as well as
eavesdropper's links, respectively. Secrecy analysis is accomplished by
deriving closed-form expressions of three familiar secrecy measures i.e. secure
outage probability for multicasting, probability of non-zero secrecy multicast
capacity, and ergodic secrecy multicast capacity. We further capitalize on
those expressions to observe the effects of all system parameters which are
again corroborated via Monte-Carlo simulations. Our observations indicate that
a secrecy tradeoff between the number of relays and number of receivers,
eavesdroppers, and shadowing parameters can be established to maintain the
admissible security level by decreasing the detrimental influences of fading,
shadowing, the number of multicast receivers and eavesdroppers.

gaps in the latter act as walls that confine electrons in $N$ in a square-well
potential. If the voltage $V$ across $N$ is finite, an electron injected into
the well undergoes multiple Andreev reflections (MAR) until it gains enough
energy to overcome the energy barrier. Because each reflection converts an
electron to a hole (or vice versa), while creating (or destroying) a Cooper
pair, the MAR process shuttles a stream of pairs across the junction. An
interesting question is, given a finite $V$, what percentage of the shuttled
pairs end up as a Josephson supercurrent? This fraction does not seem to have
been measured. Here we show that, in high-transparency junctions based on the
type II Dirac semimetal MoTe$_2$, the MAR leads to a stair-case profile in the
current-voltage ($I$-$V$) response, corresponding to pairs shuttled
incoherently by the $n^{th}$-order process. By varying the phase $\varphi$
across the junction, we demonstrate that a Josephson supercurrent ${\bf J}_{\rm
s}\sim \sin\varphi$ co-exists with the MAR steps, even at large $V$. The
observed linear increase in the amplitude of ${\bf J}_{\rm s}$ with $n$ (for
small $n$) implies that ${\bf J}_{\rm s}$ originates from the population of
pairs that are coherently shuttled. We infer that the MAR steps and the
supercurrent are complementary aspects of the Andreev process. The experiment
yields the percentage of shuttled pairs that form the supercurrent. At large
$V$, the coherent fraction is initially linear in $n$. However, as $V\to 0$
($n\gg 1$), almost all the pairs end up as the observed Josephson supercurrent.

A more general aim is to identify chemical processes applicable to other

in (circum)stellar parameters and evolutionary phases were observed in a
homogeneous observing strategy allowing for an unambiguous comparison. Data
were obtained between 213.83 and 269.71 GHz at high (0.025-0.050 arcsec),
medium (0.13-0.24 arcsec), and low (about 1 arcsec) angular resolution. The

sample properties, data reduction, and an overview of the data products are

fraction of the gas reaches a velocity which can be up to a factor of two times
larger than previously reported terminal velocities assuming isotropic
expansion, and the wind kinematic profiles establish that the radial velocity
described by the momentum equation for a spherical wind structure cannot
capture the complexity of the velocity field. In 15 sources, some molecular
transitions other than 12CO v=0 J=2-1 reach a higher outflow velocity, with a
spatial emission zone that is often greater than 30 stellar radii, but much
less than the extent of CO. Binary interaction with a (sub)stellar companion

morphologies related to their power: collimated high-power jets ending in a
bright termination shock and low-power jets opening up close to the core and
showing a more diffuse surface brightness distribution. The emergence of this

studied with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio observations of
blazars in which the jet emission is strongly Doppler boosted due to
relativistic bulk motion at small angles between the jet direction and the line

parsec-scale radio jets of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae
objects (BL Lacs) on parsec scales to derive properties of the magnetic field,
environment, and energetics for different classes of extragalactic jets. We
analyze the VLBI radio data of 15 FSRQs, 11 BL Lacs, and two radio galaxies

brightness-temperature and jet-width gradients along the jet axis from
parameterizations of the jets using 2D Gaussian brightness distributions. In
most BL Lac objects, the diameter and brightness-temperature gradients along
the jet axis can generally be described well by single power laws, while the
jets of FSRQs show more complex behavior and remain more strongly collimated on
larger physical scales. We find evidence for a transition of the global jet

LOCAL model. Fractional $c$-colorings can be understood as multicolorings as
follows. For some natural numbers $p$ and $q$ such that $p/q\leq c$, each node
$v$ is assigned a set of at least $q$ colors from $\{1,\dots,p\}$ such that
adjacent nodes are assigned disjoint sets of colors. The minimum $c$ for which
a fractional $c$-coloring of a graph $G$ exists is called the fractional
chromatic number $\chi_f(G)$ of $G$.
  Recently, [Bousquet, Esperet, and Pirot; SIROCCO '21] showed that for any
constant $\epsilon>0$, a fractional $(\Delta+\epsilon)$-coloring can be
computed in $\Delta^{O(\Delta)} + O(\Delta\cdot\log^* n)$ rounds. We show that
such a coloring can be computed in only $O(\log^2 \Delta)$ rounds, without any
dependency on $n$.
  We further show that in $O\big(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon}\big)$ rounds, it is
possible to compute a fractional $(1+\epsilon)\chi_f(G)$-coloring, even if the
fractional chromatic number $\chi_f(G)$ is not known. That is, this problem can
be approximated arbitrarily well by an efficient algorithm in the LOCAL model.
For the standard coloring problem, it is only known that an $O\big(\frac{\log
n}{\log\log n}\big)$-approximation can be computed in polylogarithmic time in
the LOCAL model. We also show that our distributed fractional coloring
approximation algorithm is best possible. We show that in trees, which have
fractional chromatic number $2$, computing a fractional $(2+\epsilon)$-coloring
requires at least $\Omega\big(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon}\big)$ rounds.
  We finally study fractional colorings of regular grids. In [Bousquet,
Esperet, and Pirot; SIROCCO '21], it is shown that in regular grids of bounded
dimension, a fractional $(2+\epsilon)$-coloring can be computed in time
$O(\log^* n)$. We show that such a coloring can even be computed in $O(1)$
rounds in the LOCAL model.

characterize the interface deformation and the manner in which the coupling
modifies the microswimmer translation itself. We treat the role of the swimmer
type (pushers and pullers), size and model an interface that can deform due to
both surface tension and bending elasticity. Our analysis reveals a strong
dependence of the hydrodynamics on the swimmer orientation and position. Given
the viscosities of the two fluid media, the interface properties and the
swimmer type, a swimmer can either migrate towards or away from the interface
depending on its configurations. When the swimmer is oriented parallel to the
interface, a pusher-type swimmer is repelled from the interface at short times
if it is swimming in the more viscous fluid. At long times however, pushers are
always attracted to the interface, and pullers are always repelled from it. On
the other hand, swimmers oriented orthogonal to the interface exhibit a
migration pattern opposite to the parallel swimmers. In consequence, a host of
complex migration trajectories emerge for swimmers arbitrarily oriented to the
interface. We find that confining a swimmer between a rigid boundary and a
deformable interface results in regimes of attraction towards both surfaces
depending on the swimmer location in the channel, irrespective viscosity ratio.
The differing migration patterns are most prominent in a region of order the
swimmer size from the interface, where the slender swimmer model yields a
better approximation to the coupled hydrodynamics.

depreciation of the disorder-averaged success probability in response to the

major science drivers for the next generation of telescopes. Current direct
imaging instruments are limited by evolving non-common path aberrations
(NCPAs). The NCPAs must be compensated for by using the science focal-plane
image. A promising sensor is the self-coherent camera (SCC). An SCC modifies
the Lyot stop in the coronagraph to introduce a probe electric field. However,
the SCC has a weak probe electric field due to the requirements on the pinhole
separation. A spectrally modulated self-coherent camera (SM-SCC) is proposed as
a solution to the throughput problem. The SM-SCC uses a pinhole with a spectral
filter and a dichroic beam splitter, which creates images with and without the
probe electric field. This allows the pinhole to be placed closer to the pupil
edge and increases the throughput. Combining the SM-SCC with an integral field
unit (IFU) can be used to apply more complex modulation patterns to the pinhole
and the Lyot stop. A modulation scheme with at least three spectral channels
(e.g. IFU) can be used to change the pinhole to an arbitrary aperture with
higher throughput. Numerical simulations show that the SM-SCC increases the
pinhole throughput by a factor of 32, which increases the wavefront sensor
sensitivity by a factor of 5.7. The SM-SCC reaches a contrast of
$1\cdot10^{-9}$ for bright targets in closed-loop control with the presence of
photon noise, phase errors, and amplitude errors. The contrast floor on fainter
targets is photon-noise-limited and reaches $1\cdot10^{-7}$. For bright
targets, the SM-SCC-IFU reaches a contrast of $3\cdot10^{-9}$ in closed-loop
control with photon noise, amplitude errors, and phase errors. The SM-SCC is a
promising focal-plane wavefront sensor for systems that use multiband
observations, either through integral field spectroscopy or dual-band imaging.

immense potential to improve the safety of high-risk engineering structures.
These materials are intrinsically self-sensing because their electrical
conductivity is affected by deformations and damage. This property, known as
piezoresistivity, has been extensively leveraged for conductivity-based damage
detection via electrical resistance change methods and tomographic imaging
techniques such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Although these
techniques are very effective at detecting the presence of damage, they suffer
from an inability to provide precise information about damage shape, size, or
mechanism. This is particularly detrimental for laminated composites which can
suffer from complex failure modes, such as delaminations, that are difficult to
detect. To that end, we herein propose a new technique for precisely
determining damage shape and size in self-sensing composites. Our technique
makes use of a genetic algorithm (GA) integrated with realistic physics-based
damage models to recover precise damage shape from conductivity changes imaged
via EIT. We experimentally validate this technique on carbon nanofiber
(CNF)-modified glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminates by considering
two specific damage mechanisms: through-holes and delaminations. Our results
show that this novel technique can accurately reconstruct multiple
through-holes with radii as small as 1.19 mm and delaminations caused by low
velocity impacts. These findings illustrate that coupling piezoresistivity with
conductivity-based spatial imaging techniques and physics-based inversion
strategies can enable damage shaping capabilities in self-sensing composite

importance for nanophotonics, and chirality is a prototypical example of such a
property, with applications ranging from photochemistry to nonlinear photonics.
A measure of electromagnetic chirality with a well-defined upper bound has
recently been proposed. Here, we optimize the shape of silver helices at
discrete frequencies ranging from the far infrared to the optical band.
Gaussian process optimization, taking into account also shape derivative
information of the helices scattering response, is used to maximize the
electromagnetic chirality. We show that the theoretical designs achieve more
than 90 percent of the upper bound of em-chirality for wavelenghts
\SI{3}{\micro\meter} or larger, while their performance decreases towards the
optical band. We fabricate and characterize helices for operation at
\SI{800}{\nano\meter}, and identify some of the imperfections that affect the
performance. Our work motivates further research both on the theoretical and
fabrication sides to unlock potential applications of objects with large
electromagnetic chirality at optical frequencies, such as helicity filtering
glasses. We show that, at \SI{3}{\micro\meter}, a thin slab of randomly

further demonstrated that a) using pairs of different audio segments from the

Understanding of the magnetoresistive properties and their correlation to the

Fe3(Ge,As)Te2. Interestingly, doping at the non-magnetic (Ge) site results in
an unconventional Hall effect whose strength was considerably modified by
increasing As concentration, possibly arising from emergent electromagnetic
behavior from underlying complicated spin configurations. The present results
provide a possible route to understand the intricate role played by the
non-magnetic (Ge) atom towards magnetic properties of vdW FMs, and shows a
novel direction towards tailoring of underlying interactions responsible for

atmosphere. These waves are important in the context of solar physics as it is
widely believed they can contribute to the energy budget of the solar
atmosphere and are a prime candidate to contribute towards coronal heating.
Realistic models of these waves are required representing observed
configurations such that plasma properties can be determined more accurately
which can not be measured directly. This work utilises a previously developed
numerical technique to find permittable eigenvalues under different non-uniform
equilibrium conditions in a Cartesian magnetic slab geometry. Here we
investigate the properties of magnetoacoustic waves under non-uniform
equilibria in a cylindrical geometry. Previously obtained analytical results
are retrieved to emphasise the power and applicability of this numerical
technique. Further case studies investigate the effect that a radially
non-uniform plasma density and non-uniform plasma flow, modelled as a series of
Gaussian profiles, has on the properties of different MHD waves. For all cases
the dispersion diagrams are obtained and spatial eigenfunctions calculated
which display the effects of the equilibrium inhomogeneity. It is shown that as
the equilibrium non-uniformity is increased, the radial spatial eigenfunctions
are affected and extra nodes introduced, similar to the previous investigation
of a magnetic slab. Furthermore, azimuthal perturbations are increased with
increasing inhomogeneity introducing vortical motions inside the waveguide.
Finally, 2D and 3D representations of the velocity fields are shown which may
be useful for observers for wave mode identification under realistic magnetic
waveguides with ever increasing instrument resolution.

that the probability distribution function (PDF) of spheres in the matter field

particularly useful for probing modifications of gravity or expansion history.
Our approach in Cataneo et. al. 2021 extends the success of Large Deviation
Theory for predicting the matter PDF in $\Lambda$CDM in these ''extended''

matter PDF via constraints for a Euclid-like survey volume combining the 3D
matter PDF with the 3D matter power spectrum. Adding the matter PDF halves the
uncertainties on parameters in an evolving dark energy model, relative to the
power spectrum alone. Additionally, the matter PDF contains enough non-linear

from General Relativity, with improvements up to six times the power spectrum

convergence rate of the $k$-th marginals $f^{(k)}$ to the product of $k$
solutions of the corresponding Vlasov-Alignment equation, $f^{\otimes k}$.
Specifically, the following estimate holds in terms of Wasserstein-2 metric

package uses temperature sensors that would have been brought to the target
depth of 3--5 m by a small penetrator, nicknamed the mole. The mole requiring
friction on its hull to balance remaining recoil from its hammer mechanism did
not penetrate to the targeted depth. Instead, by precessing about a point
midway along its hull, it carved a 7 cm deep and 5-6 cm wide pit and reached a
depth of initially 31 cm. The root cause of the failure - as was determined
through an extensive, almost two years long campaign - was a lack of friction
in an unexpectedly thick cohesive duricrust. During the campaign -- described
in detail in this paper -- the mole penetrated further aided by friction
applied using the scoop at the end of the robotic Instrument Deployment Arm and
by direct support by the latter. The mole finally reached a depth of 40 cm,
bringing the mole body 1--2 cm below the surface. The penetration record of the
mole and its thermal sensors were used to measure thermal and mechanical soil
parameters such as the thermal conductivity and the penetration resistance of
the duricrust and its cohesion. The hammerings of the mole were recorded by the
seismometer SEIS and the signals could be used to derive a P-wave velocity and
a S-wave velocity and elastic moduli representative of the topmost tens of cm
of the regolith. The combined data were used to derive a model of the regolith

layer of sand mixed with dust and above another 10 cm of unconsolidated sand.
Underneath the latter, a layer more resistant to penetration and possibly
consisting of debris from a small impact crater is inferred.

affected by disturbances. By tightening constraints probabilistically with
respect to the additive disturbance and robustly with respect to the
measurement noise, satisfaction of original chance-constraints is guaranteed.
The resulting data-driven receding horizon optimal control problem is
lightweight and recursively feasible, and renders the closed loop
input-to-state stable with respect to both additive disturbances and
measurement noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in

various symmetry-breaking orders that populate the cuprates. Here we report the
observation of charge density waves (CDWs) in infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$ films

CDWs and the Nd 5$d$ - Ni 3$d$ orbital hybridisation. Upon entering the
superconducting state at 20\% Sr doping, the CDWs disappear. Our work

  Surfaces",,,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel approach for the joint design of a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) and a transmitter-receiver pair that are trained
together as a set of deep neural networks (DNNs) to optimize the end-to-end
communication performance at the receiver. The RIS is a software-defined array
of unit cells that can be controlled in terms of the scattering and reflection
profiles to focus the incoming signals from the transmitter to the receiver.
The benefit of the RIS is to improve the coverage and spectral efficiency for
wireless communications by overcoming physical obstructions of the
line-of-sight (LoS) links. The selection process of the RIS beam codeword (out
of a pre-defined codebook) is formulated as a DNN, while the operations of the
transmitter-receiver pair are modeled as two DNNs, one for the encoder (at the
transmitter) and the other one for the decoder (at the receiver) of an
autoencoder, by accounting for channel effects including those induced by the
RIS in between. The underlying DNNs are jointly trained to minimize the symbol
error rate at the receiver. Numerical results show that the proposed design
achieves major gains in error performance with respect to various baseline
schemes, where no RIS is used or the selection of the RIS beam is separated
from the design of the transmitter-receiver pair.

and internal organization of the information encoded into an object such as an
infinite binary sequence. We consider a natural way to relativize the notion of
depth for such sets, and we investigate for various kinds of oracles whether
and how the unrelativized and the relativized version of depth differ.
Intuitively speaking, access to an oracle increases computation power.
Accordingly, for most notions for sets considered in computability theory, for
the corresponding classes trivially for all oracles the unrelativized class is
contained in the relativized class or for all oracles the relativized class is
contained in the unrelativized class. Examples for these two cases are given by
the classes of computable and of Martin-L\""{o}f random sets, respectively.
However, in the case for depth the situation is different. It turns out that
the classes of deep sets and of sets that are deep relative to the halting set
$\emptyset '$ are incomparable with respect to set-theoretical inclusion. On
the other hand, the class of deep sets is strictly contained in the class of
sets that are deep relative to any given Martin-L\""{o}f-random oracle. The set
built in the proof of the latter result can also be used to give a short proof
of the known fact that every PA-complete degree is Turing-equivalent to the
join of two Martin-L\""{o}f-random sets. In fact, we slightly strengthen this
result by showing that every DNC$_2$ function is truth-table-equivalent to the
join of two Martin-L\""{o}f random sets. Furthermore, we observe that the class
of deep sets relative to any given K-trivial oracle either is the same as or is
strictly contained in the class of deep sets. Obviously, the former case
applies to computable oracles. We leave it as an open problem which of the two
possibilities can occur for noncomputable K-trivial oracles.

vision-and-language (VL) fusion. Through extensive experiments on 5 VL tasks
and 5 robust VQA benchmarks, we find that: (i) Without pre-training, using MLPs
for multimodal fusion has a noticeable performance gap compared to
transformers; (ii) However, VL pre-training can help close the performance gap;
(iii) Instead of heavy multi-head attention, adding tiny one-head attention to
MLPs is sufficient to achieve comparable performance to transformers. Moreover,
we also find that the performance gap between MLPs and transformers is not
widened when being evaluated on the harder robust VQA benchmarks, suggesting
using MLPs for VL fusion can generalize roughly to a similar degree as using
transformers. These results hint that MLPs can effectively learn to align
vision and text features extracted from lower-level encoders without heavy
reliance on self-attention. Based on this, we ask an even bolder question: can
we have an all-MLP architecture for VL modeling, where both VL fusion and the
vision encoder are replaced with MLPs? Our result shows that an all-MLP VL
model is sub-optimal compared to state-of-the-art full-featured VL models when
both of them get pre-trained. However, pre-training an all-MLP can surprisingly
achieve a better average score than full-featured transformer models without
pre-training. This indicates the potential of large-scale pre-training of
MLP-like architectures for VL modeling and inspires the future research
direction on simplifying well-established VL modeling with less inductive
design bias. Our code is publicly available at:

multi-agent reinforcement learning methods with linear value decomposition

the correspondence between individual greedy actions and the maximal true Q

where each self-transition node (STN) is a possible convergence. To ensure
optimal consistency, the optimal node is required to be the unique STN.
Therefore, we propose the greedy-based value representation (GVR), which turns
the optimal node into an STN via inferior target shaping and further eliminates
the non-optimal STNs via superior experience replay. In addition, GVR achieves
an adaptive trade-off between optimality and stability. Our method outperforms

challenging to directly observe these stars and their immediate environments.
It is known that accretion and ejection processes are intrinsically related,
thus observing massive protostellar outflows can provide crucial information
about the processes governing massive star formation close to the central
engine. We aim to probe the IRAS 18264-1152 (G19.88-0.53) high-mass
star-forming complex in the near infrared (NIR) through its molecular hydrogen
(H2) jets to analyse the morphology and composition of the line emitting
regions and to compare with other outflow tracers. We observed the H2 NIR jets
via K-band (1.9-2.5um) observations obtained with the integral field units
VLT/SINFONI and VLT/KMOS. SINFONI provides the highest NIR angular resolution
achieved so far for the central region (~0.2''). We compared the geometry of
the NIR outflows with that of the associated molecular outflow probed by CO
(2-1) emission mapped with SMA. We identify nine point sources. Four of these
display a rising continuum in the K-band and are BrG emitters, revealing that
they are young, potentially jet-driving sources. The spectro-imaging analysis
focusses on the H2 jets, for which we derived visual extinction, temperature,
column density, area, and mass. The intensity, velocity, and excitation maps
based on H2 emission strongly support the existence of a protostellar cluster,
with at least two (and up to four) different large-scale outflows. The
literature is in agreement with the outflow morphology found here. We derived a
stellar density of ~4000 stars pc^-3. Our study reveals the presence of several
outflows driven by young sources from a forming cluster of young, massive
stars. The derived stellar number density together with the geometry of the
outflows suggest that stars can form in a relatively ordered manner in this
cluster.

the possibility of probing salient exotic phenomena in condensed matter and
high-energy physics, along with potential applications in quantum information
and science technologies. In light of the impressive ongoing efforts to achieve
such realizations, a fundamental question regarding quantum link model
regularizations of lattice gauge theories is how faithfully they capture the
quantum field theory limit of gauge theories. Recent work [Zache, Van Damme,
Halimeh, Hauke, and Banerjee, at
https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.L091502 has shown
through analytic derivations, exact diagonalization, and infinite matrix
product state calculations that the low-energy physics of $1+1$D
$\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link models approaches the quantum field theory limit
already at small link spin length $S$. Here, we show that the approach to this
limit also lends itself to the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of lattice
gauge theories, as demonstrated by our numerical simulations of the Loschmidt
return rate and the chiral condensate in infinite matrix product states, which
work directly in the thermodynamic limit. Similar to our findings in
equilibrium that show a distinct behavior between half-integer and integer link
spin lengths, we find that criticality emerging in the Loschmidt return rate is
fundamentally different between half-integer and integer spin quantum link
models in the regime of strong electric-field coupling. Our results further
affirm that state-of-the-art finite-size ultracold-atom and NISQ-device
implementations of quantum link lattice gauge theories have the real potential
to simulate their quantum field theory limit even in the far-from-equilibrium
regime.

significantly from the randoms' across scales of 35 to 155 Mpc, which is a
robust signature of clustering. In addition to $k$NN, we also measure the
two-point correlation function for the same set of redMaPPer clusters versus
random points, which shows a noisier and less significant clustering signal
within the same radial scales. Quantitatively, the $\chi^2$ distribution for
both the $k$NN-CDFs and the two-point correlation function measured on the
randoms peak at $\chi^2\sim 50$ (null hypothesis), whereas the $k$NN-CDFs

4NN CDFs deviate from the predicted $k=3, 4$-NN CDFs assuming an ideal Gaussian
field, indicating a non-Gaussian clustering signal for redMaPPer clusters,
although its origin might not be cosmological due to observational systematics.

suppress the ultraviolet cutoff. We also compute the CP breaking due to
high-energy instantons in QCD. In the absence of vectorlike pairs, we find
contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment that are not excluded, but
that could be accessible to future experiments if the scale of supersymmetry
breaking is sufficiently low. The existence of vectorlike pairs can lead to a
larger dipole moment. Finally, we show that a significant fraction of models

is the detection of overmassive black holes in the centers of some UCDs, which
also lead to elevated dynamical mass-to-light ratios ($M/L_{dyn}$). Here we
present new high-resolution spectroscopic observations of 321 luminous GC
candidates in the massive galaxy NGC 5128/Centaurus A. Using these data we
confirm 27 new luminous GCs, and measure velocity dispersions for 57 luminous
GCs (with $g$-band luminosities between $2.5 \times 10^5$ and $2.5 \times 10^7
L_{\odot}$), of which 48 are new measurements. Combining these data with size
measurements from Gaia, we determine the $M/L_{dyn}$ for all 57 luminous GCs.
We see a clear bimodality in the $M/L_{dyn}$ distribution, with a population of
normal GCs with mean $M/L_{dyn}=1.51\pm0.31$, and a second population of
$\sim$20 GCs with elevated mean $M/L_{dyn}=2.68\pm0.22$. We show that black
holes with masses $\sim4$-18 % of the luminous GCs can explain the elevated
mass-to-light ratios. Hence, it is plausible that the NGC 5128 sources with
elevated $M/L_{dyn}$ are mostly stripped galaxy nuclei that contain massive
central black holes, though future high spatial resolution observations are
necessary to confirm this hypothesis for individual sources. We also present a
detailed discussion of an extreme outlier, \textit{VHH81-01}, one of the
largest and most massive GC in NGC 5128, making it an exceptionally strong

formation and evolution of galaxies. However, many questions still remain, and
the uncertainty on the epoch of reionization is large. In this approach, some
models allow a double-reionization scenario, although the number of confirmed
detections at very high $z$ is still too low to serve as observational proof.
The main goal of this project is studying whether we can search for
Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z \sim 9$ using a narrow-band (NB) filter
that was specifically designed by our team and was built for this experiment.
We used the NB technique to select candidates by measuring the flux excess due
to the Ly$\alpha$ emission. The observations were taken with an NB filter (full
width at half minimum of 11 nm and central wavelength $\lambda_{c} = 1.257
\mu$m) and the CIRCE near-infrared camera for the GTC. We describe a data
reduction procedure that was especially optimized to minimize instrumental
effects. With a total exposure time of 18.3 hours, the final NB image covers an
area of $\sim 6.7$ arcmin$^{2}$, which corresponds to a comoving volume of $1.1
\times 10^{3}$ Mpc$^{3}$ at $z = 9.3$. We pushed the source detection to its
limit, which allows us to analyze an initial sample of 97 objects. We detail
the different criteria we applied to select the candidates. The criteria
included visual verifications in different photometric bands. None of the
objects resembled a reliable LAE, however, and we found no robust candidate
down to an emission-line flux of $2.9 \times 10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1} $cm$^{-2}$,
which corresponds to a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity limit of $3 \times 10^{44}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. We derive an upper limit on the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function at $z
\sim 9$ that agrees well with previous constraints. We conclude that deeper and
wider surveys are needed to study the LAE population at the cosmic dawn.

the two measures correlate strongly, with most blue galaxies being late-types
(spirals) and most early-types, typically ellipticals, being red. This
observation has led to the use of colour as a convenient selection criteria to
make samples which are then labelled by morphology. Such use of colour as a
proxy for morphology results in necessarily impure and incomplete samples. In
this paper, we make use of the morphological labels produced by Galaxy Zoo to
measure how incomplete and impure such samples are, considering optical
(ugriz), NUV and NIR (JHK) bands. The best single colour optical selection is
found using a threshold of g-r = 0.742, but this still results in a sample
where only 56% of red galaxies are smooth and 56% of smooth galaxies are red.
Use of the NUV gives some improvement over purely optical bands, particularly
for late-types, but still results in low purity/completeness for early-types.
No significant improvement is found by adding NIR bands. With any two bands,
including NUV, a sample of early-types with greater than two-thirds purity
cannot be constructed. Advances in quantitative galaxy morphologies have made
colour-morphology proxy selections largely unnecessary going forward; where
such assumptions are still required, we recommend studies carefully consider
the implications of sample incompleteness/impurity.

high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations performed with GIZMO to
investigate the effect of magnetic fields on primordial galaxy formation.
Physical processes such as relevant gas physics (e.g., gas cooling and gas
chemistry), star formation, stellar and supernova feedback, and chemical
enrichment were considered in the simulations. The simulation results suggest
that cosmic magnetic fields can be amplified from 1e-13 G to a few microgauss
during cosmic structure evolution and galaxy formation. In the ideal MHD
setting, in primordial galaxies at z>8, the magnetic energy is less than the
thermal and kinetic energy, and therefore, magnetic fields hardly affect the
gas dynamics and star formation in these galaxies. Specifically, the
consideration of micro-physics properties such as metal diffusion, heat
conduction, and viscosity in the MHD simulations, could increase the magnetic
field strength. Notably, metal diffusion reduced gas cooling by decreasing the
metallicity and thereby suppresses star formation in the primordial galaxies.
As a result, the cosmic re-ionization driven by these primordial galaxies may
be delayed.

information from the power spectrum multipoles, the real-space power spectrum,
the reconstructed power spectrum and the bispectrum monopole. This is the first
analysis to feature a complete treatment of the galaxy bispectrum, including a
consistent theoretical model and without large-scale cuts. Unlike previous
works, the statistics are measured using window-free estimators: this greatly
reduces computational costs by removing the need to window-convolve the theory
model. Our pipeline is tested using a suite of high-resolution mocks and shown
to be robust and precise, with systematic errors far below the statistical
thresholds. Inclusion of the bispectrum yields consistent parameter constraints
and shrinks the $\sigma_8$ posterior by $13\%$ to reach $<5\%$ precision; less
conservative analysis choices would reduce the error-bars further. Our
constraints are broadly consistent with Planck: in particular, we find $H_0 =
69.6^{+1.1}_{-1.3}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\sigma_8 =
0.692^{+0.035}_{-0.041}$ and $n_s=0.870^{+0.067}_{-0.064}$, including a BBN
prior on the baryon density. When $n_s$ is set by Planck, we find $H_0 =
68.31^{+0.83}_{-0.86}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and
$\sigma_8 = 0.722^{+0.032}_{-0.036}$. Our $S_8$ posterior, $0.751\pm0.039$, is
consistent with weak lensing studies, but lower than Planck. Constraints on the
higher-order bias parameters are significantly strengthened from the inclusion
of the bispectrum, and we find no evidence for deviation from the dark matter
halo bias relations. These results represent the most complete full-shape
analysis of BOSS DR12 to-date, and the corresponding spectra will enable a
variety of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM analyses, probing phenomena such as the neutrino
mass and primordial non-Gaussianity.

carried out intranight optical monitoring of 14 flat-spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQs) located at high redshifts (1.5 < $z$ < 3.7), in 42 sessions of median
duration $\sim$ 5.4 hr. These sources were grouped into two samples
distinguished by published fractional optical polarisation: (i) nine
low-polarisation sources with $p_{opt} < 3\%$ and (ii) five high-polarisation
sources. Unexpectedly, a high duty cycle (DC $\sim$ 30$\%$) is found for
intranight variability (with amplitude $\psi > 3\%$) of the low-polarisation
sources. This DC is a few times higher than that reported for low-polarisation
FSRQs located at moderate redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 0.7) and hence typically
monitored in the rest-frame blue-optical. Further, we found no evidence for an
increased intranight variability of UV emission with polarisation, in contrast
to the strong correlation found for intranight variability of optical emission.
We briefly discuss this in the context of an existing scenario which posits
that the nonthermal UV emission of blazars arises from a relativistic particle
population different from that radiating up to near-infrared/optical
frequencies.

developed as a way to characterize the landscape of conceivable physical
theories. Thus, the GPT describing a given physical theory necessarily includes
all physically possible processes. We here consider the question of how to
provide a GPT-like characterization of a particular experimental setup within a
given physical theory. We show that the resulting characterization is not
generally a GPT in and of itself-rather, it is described by a more general
mathematical object that we introduce and term an accessible GPT fragment. We
then introduce an equivalence relation, termed cone equivalence, between
accessible GPT fragments (and, as a special case, between standard GPTs). We
give a number of examples of experimental scenarios that are best described
using accessible GPT fragments, and where moreover cone-equivalence arises
naturally. We then prove that an accessible GPT fragment admits of a classical
explanation if and only if every other fragment that is cone-equivalent to it
also admits of a classical explanation. Finally, we leverage this result to
prove several fundamental results regarding the experimental requirements for
witnessing the failure of generalized noncontextuality. In particular, we prove
that neither incompatibility among measurements nor the assumption of freedom
of choice is necessary for witnessing failures of generalized noncontextuality,
and, moreover, that such failures can be witnessed even using arbitrarily

resulting wave function is found to be proportional to the Hartle-Hawking wave
function and its dependence on $a_0$ is only through an overall phase factor.
Motivated by this observation, we ask whether it is possible to analytically
extend $a_0$ to an extended region $\bar{\mathcal{D}}$ in complex $a_0-$plane,
while retaining the Hartle-Hawking form of the wave function. We use the
condition for convergence of path integral and a recent theorem due to
Kontsevich and Segal, further extended by Witten, to explicitly find
$\bar{\mathcal{D}}$. Interestingly, a special point on the boundary of
$\bar{\mathcal{D}}$ recovers the exact no-boundary wave function. Following
that, we show that our prescription leads to a family of quantum states for the
perturbations, which give rise to scale-invariant power spectra. If we demand,
as an extra ingredient to our prescription, a matching condition at the
""no-boundary point"" in $\bar{\mathcal{D}}$, we converge on a unique quantum
state for the perturbations.

generates Majorana neutrino masses at one-loop level; the neutral partner of
the $SU(2)_L$ doublet contributes to the AMM of electron and muon via one loop
and two-loop corrections. We propose two minimal flavor structures that can
explain these anomalies while fitting the neutrino oscillation data. We find
that the neutral Higgs resides in the mass range of roughly 10-300 GeV or 1-30
GeV, depending on the flavor structures. The model is consistent with
constraints from colliders, electroweak precision data, and lepton flavor
violation. To be comprehensive, we examine the constraints from the electric

contribution to muon EDM while simultaneously giving corrections to muon AMM.

the four SN positions are more useful to constrain microlensing models. We
define the macrolens model as a combination of a baryonic component that traces
the observed light distribution, and a dark matter halo component. We constrain
the macrolens model using the positional constraints given by the 4 observed
images, and compare it with the best model obtained when magnification
constraints are included. We find that the magnification can not be explained
by a macrolens model alone, and that contributions from substructures such as
microlenses are needed to explain the observed magnifications. We consider
microlens models based on the inferred stellar mass from the baryonic component
of the macrolens model, and use the observed magnification and light curves to
constrain the contribution from microlenses. We compute the likelihood of a
variety of macro+micro lens models where we vary the dark matter halo, baryonic
component, and microlens configurations. We use information about the position,
magnification and, for the first time, the lightcurves of the four observed SN
images. We combine macrolens and microlens models in order to reproduce the
observations; the four SN positions, magnifications, and lack of fluctuations
in the light curves. After marginalizing over the model parameters, we find
that larger stellar surface mass densities are preferred. This result suggests
that the mass of the baryonic component is dominated by its stellar component.
We conclude that microlensing from the baryonic component suffices to explain
the observed flux ratios and light curves.

intrinsic limits of the process of cosmic-ray data inversion for atmospheric
temperature retrieval, by combining a detection station at ground with another
one placed at an optimal depth, and making full use of the angular information.
With that aim, the temperature-induced variations in c. r. rates have been
simulated resorting to the theoretical temperature coefficients $W_T(h, \theta,

reanalysis. Muon absorption and Poisson statistics have been included to
increase realism. The resulting c.r. sample has been used as input for the

data. Relative to early simulation works, performed without using angular
information and relying on underground temperature coefficients from a
sub-optimal depth, our analysis shows a strong improvement in temperature
predictability for all atmospheric layers up to 50 hPa, nearing a factor 2
error reduction. Furthermore, the temperature predictability on 6 h-intervals
stays well within the range 0.8-2.2 K. Most remarkably, we show that it can be
achieved with small-area m$^2$-scale muon hodoscopes, amenable nowadays to a

boson stars, was recently found as solutions to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon
system. The generalization consists in incorporating some of the effects of
angular momentum, while still maintaining the spacetime's spherical symmetry.
These new solutions depend on an (integer) angular parameter $\ell$, and hence
were named $\ell$-boson stars. Like the standard $\ell=0$ boson stars these
configurations admit a stable branch in the solution space; however, contrary
to them they have a morphology that presents a shell-like structure with a
""hole"" in the internal region. In this article we perform a thorough
exploration of the parameter space, concentrating particularly on the extreme
cases with large values of $\ell$. We show that the shells grow in size with
the angular parameter, doing so linearly for large values, with the size
growing faster than the thickness. Their mass also increases with $\ell$, but
in such a way that their compactness, while also growing monotonically,
converges to a finite value corresponding to about one half of the Buchdahl
limit for stable configurations. Furthermore, we show that $\ell$-boson stars
can be highly anisotropic, with the radial pressure diminishing relative to the
tangential pressure for large $\ell$, reducing asymptotically to zero, and with
the maximum density also approaching zero. We show that these properties can be
understood by analyzing the asymptotic limit $\ell\rightarrow\infty$ of the
field equations and their solutions. We also analyze the existence and
characteristics of both timelike and null circular orbits, especially for very
compact solutions.

are powered by radioactive decay of Nickel-56 and evolve more slowly. AT2018cow
(at redshift of 0.014) is an extreme FBOT in terms of rapid evolution and high
luminosities. Here we present evidence for a high-amplitude quasi-periodic
oscillation (QPO) of AT2018cow's soft X-rays with a frequency of 224 Hz (at
3.7$\sigma$ significance level or false alarm probability of 0.02%) and
fractional root-mean-squared amplitude of >30%. This signal is found in the
average power density spectrum taken over the entire 60-day outburst and
suggests a highly persistent signal that lasts for a billion cycles. The high
frequency (rapid timescale) of 224 Hz (4.4 ms) argues for a compact object in
AT2018cow, which can be a neutron star or black hole with a mass less than 850
solar masses. If the QPO is the spin period of a neutron star, we can set
limits on the star's magnetic field strength. Our work highlights a new way of
using high time-resolution X-ray observations to study FBOTs.

Adversarial patch attacks, which are easy to implement in the physical world,
pose a serious threat to state-of-the-art object detectors. Developing reliable
defenses for object detectors against patch attacks is critical but severely
understudied. In this paper, we propose Segment and Complete defense (SAC), a
general framework for defending object detectors against patch attacks through
detection and removal of adversarial patches. We first train a patch segmenter
that outputs patch masks which provide pixel-level localization of adversarial
patches. We then propose a self adversarial training algorithm to robustify the
patch segmenter. In addition, we design a robust shape completion algorithm,
which is guaranteed to remove the entire patch from the images if the outputs
of the patch segmenter are within a certain Hamming distance of the
ground-truth patch masks. Our experiments on COCO and xView datasets
demonstrate that SAC achieves superior robustness even under strong adaptive
attacks with no reduction in performance on clean images, and generalizes well
to unseen patch shapes, attack budgets, and unseen attack methods. Furthermore,
we present the APRICOT-Mask dataset, which augments the APRICOT dataset with
pixel-level annotations of adversarial patches. We show SAC can significantly
reduce the targeted attack success rate of physical patch attacks. Our code is

applicable in estimating disease-specific survival. Relative survival analysis
may be used to estimate disease-specific survival when cause of death is either
unknown or subject to misspecification and not reliable for practical usage.
This method is popular for population-based cancer survival studies using
registry data and does not require CoD information. The standard estimator is
the ratio of all-cause survival in the cancer cohort group to the known
expected survival from a general reference population. Disease-specific death
competes with other causes of mortality, potentially creating dependence among
the CoD. The standard ratio estimate is only valid when death from disease and
death from other causes are independent. To relax the independence assumption,
we formulate dependence using a copula-based model. Likelihood-based parametric
method is used to fit the distribution of disease-specific death without CoD
information, where the copula is assumed known and the distribution of other
cause of mortality is derived from the reference population. We propose a
sensitivity analysis, where the analysis is conducted across a range of assumed
dependence structures. We demonstrate the utility of our method through
simulation studies and an application to French breast cancer data.

be abundant at the outer edge of the CO depletion zone, where CO is actively
adsorbed. CO adsorption correlates with volume density in cold cores, and, in
nearby molecular clouds, the catastrophic CO freeze-out happens at volume
densities above 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The methanol production rate is maximized
there and its freeze-out rate does not overcome its production rate, while the
molecules are shielded from UV destruction by gas and dust. Thus, in cold
cores, methanol abundance should generally correlate with visual extinction
that depends both on volume and column density. In this work, we test the most
basic model prediction that maximum methanol abundance is associated with a
local $A_V\simeq$4 mag in dense cores and constrain the model parameters with
the observational data. With the IRAM 30 m antenna, we mapped the CH$_3$OH
(2-1) and (3-2) transitions toward seven dense cores in the L1495 filament in
Taurus to measure the methanol abundance. We use the Herschel/SPIRE maps to
estimate visual extinction, and the C$^{18}$O(2-1) maps from Tafalla & Hacar

extinction varying the key model parameters. The modeling results show that
hydrogen surface diffusion via tunneling is crucial to reproduce the observed
methanol abundances, and the needed reactive desorption efficiency matches the
one deduced from laboratory experiments.

visualize the dissimilarities between DIBs, represented by 1 - r_norm, using

ultra-sensitive microwave cavities. The ADMX experiment uses a cylindrical
cavity operating at the fundamental mode to search for axions in the few
micro-eV mass range. However, the ADMX search technique becomes increasingly
challenging with increasing axion mass. This is because higher masses require
smaller-diameter cavities, and a smaller cavity volume reduces the signal
strength. Thus, there is interest in developing more sophisticated resonators
to overcome this problem. The ADMX-Orpheus experiment uses a dielectric-loaded
Fabry-Perot cavity to search for axions and dark photons with masses
approaching 100 micro-eV. Orpheus maintains a large volume by operating at a
higher-order mode, and the dielectrics shape the electric field so that the

Theoretical approaches have attempted to answer the contradicting behavior of
the object, resisting the expected dissolution of a gaseous cloud due to tidal
forces in combination with evaporation and hydrodynamical instabilities.
However, assuming that the object is rather a dust-enshrouded young stellar
object seems to be in line with the predictions of several groups and

an extended and stretched component as it appeared in previous representations
of the same data. Considering our recent publications, we propose that the

nonparametric short-term queue length estimation in terms of cycle-by-cycle
partially observed queues from probe vehicles. The method does not assume
random arrivals and does not assume any primary parameters or estimation of any
parameters but uses simple algebraic expressions that only depend on signal
timing. For an approach lane at a traffic intersection, the conditional queue
lengths given probe vehicle location, count, time, and analysis interval (e.g.,
at the end of red signal phase) are represented by a Negative Hypergeometric
distribution. The estimators obtained are compared with parametric methods and
simple highway capacity manual methods using field test data involving probe
vehicles. The analysis indicates that the nonparametric methods presented in
this paper match the accuracy of parametric methods used in the field test data
for estimating queue lengths.

(TO) framework to help efficiently explore the design space of components
fabricated using metal additive manufacturing (AM), while ensuring
manufacturability with respect to cracking. Specifically, parts fabricated
through Laser Powder Bed Fusion are prone to defects such as warpage or
cracking due to high residual stress values generated from the steep thermal
gradients produced during the build process. Maturing the design for such parts
and planning their fabrication can span months to years, often involving
multiple handoffs between design and manufacturing engineers. PATO is based on
the a priori discovery of crack-free designs, so that the optimized part can be
built defect-free at the outset. To ensure that the design is crack free during
optimization, producibility is explicitly encoded within the standard
formulation of TO, using a crack index. Multiple crack indices are explored and
using experimental validation, maximum shear strain index (MSSI) is shown to be
an accurate crack index. Simulating the build process is a coupled,
multi-physics computation and incorporating it in the TO loop can be
computationally prohibitive. We leverage the current advances in deep
convolutional neural networks and present a high-fidelity surrogate model based
on an Attention-based U-Net architecture to predict the MSSI values as a
spatially varying field over the part's domain. Further, we employ automatic
differentiation to directly compute the gradient of maximum MSSI with respect
to the input design variables and augment it with the performance-based
sensitivity field to optimize the design while considering the trade-off
between weight, manufacturability, and functionality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method through benchmark studies in 3D as well as
experimental validation.

  Charging: A Pilot Study","19 pages, 12 figures; To appear in Transportation Research Part D",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Wide-scale electrification of the transportation sector will require careful
planning and coordination with the power grid. Left unmanaged, uncoordinated
charging of electric vehicles (EVs) at increased levels of penetration will
amplify existing peak loads, potentially outstripping the grid's capacity to
reliably meet demand. In this paper, we report findings from the OptimizEV
Project - a real-world pilot study in Upstate New York exploring a novel
approach to coordinated residential EV charging. The proposed coordination
mechanism seeks to harness the latent flexibility in EV charging by offering EV
owners monetary incentives to delay the time required to charge their EVs. Each
time an EV owner initiates a charging session, they specify how long they
intend to leave their vehicle plugged in by selecting from a menu of deadlines
that offers lower electricity prices the longer they're willing to delay the
time required to charge their EV. Given a collection of active charging
requests, a smart charging system dynamically optimizes the power being drawn
by each EV in real time to minimize strain on the grid, while ensuring that
each customer's car is fully charged by its deadline. Under the proposed
incentive mechanism, we find that customers are frequently willing to engage in
optimized charging sessions, allowing the system to delay the completion of
their charging requests by more than eight hours on average. Using the
flexibility provided by customers, the smart charging system was shown to be
highly effective in shifting the majority of EV charging loads off-peak to fill
the night-time valley of the aggregate load curve. Customer opt-in rates
remained stable over the span of the study, providing empirical evidence in
support of the proposed coordination mechanism as a potentially viable
""non-wires alternative"" to meet the increased demand for electricity driven
growing EV adoption.

and provide a new set of counterfactual guidelines that can yield causal
improvements. Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) are widely studied to formalize
this process. However, available methods in finding optimal DTRs often rely on
assumptions that are violated in real-world applications (e.g., medical
decision-making or public policy), especially when (a) the existence of
unobserved confounders cannot be ignored, and (b) the unobserved confounders
are time-varying (e.g., affected by previous actions). When such assumptions
are violated, one often faces ambiguity regarding the underlying causal model.
This ambiguity is inevitable, since the dynamics of unobserved confounders and
their causal impact on the observed part of the data cannot be understood from
the observed data. Motivated by a case study of finding superior treatment
regimes for patients who underwent transplantation in our partner hospital and
faced a medical condition known as New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation
(NODAT), we extend DTRs to a new class termed Ambiguous Dynamic Treatment
Regimes (ADTRs), in which the causal impact of treatment regimes is evaluated
based on a ""cloud"" of causal models. We then connect ADTRs to Ambiguous
Partially Observable Mark Decision Processes (APOMDPs) and develop
Reinforcement Learning methods, which enable using the observed data to
efficiently learn an optimal treatment regime. We establish theoretical results
for these learning methods, including (weak) consistency and asymptotic

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), a pivotal enabler of Smart Manufacturing (SM).
While previous relevant studies on the subject have primarily focused on time
series classification, change point detection is equally important because it
provides temporal information on changes in behavior of the machine. In this
work, we address point detection and time series classification for
machine-part interactions with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
framework. The CNN in this framework utilizes a two-stage encoder-classifier
structure for efficient feature representation and convenient deployment
customization for CPS. Though data-driven, the design and optimization of the
framework are Subject Matter Expertise (SME) guided. An SME defined Finite
State Machine (FSM) is incorporated into the framework to prohibit intermittent
misclassifications. In the case study, we implement the framework to perform
machine-part interaction classification on a milling machine, and the
performance is evaluated using a testing dataset and deployment simulations.
The implementation achieved an average F1-Score of 0.946 across classes on the
testing dataset and an average delay of 0.24 seconds on the deployment

representation learning for graph-structured data. The layer-wise graph
convolution in GNNs is shown to be powerful at capturing graph topology. During
this process, GNNs are usually guided by pre-defined kernels such as Laplacian
matrix, adjacency matrix, or their variants. However, the adoptions of
pre-defined kernels may restrain the generalities to different graphs: mismatch
between graph and kernel would entail sub-optimal performance. For example,
GNNs that focus on low-frequency information may not achieve satisfactory
performance when high-frequency information is significant for the graphs, and
vice versa. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel framework
- i.e., namely Adaptive Kernel Graph Neural Network (AKGNN) - which learns to
adapt to the optimal graph kernel in a unified manner at the first attempt. In
the proposed AKGNN, we first design a data-driven graph kernel learning
mechanism, which adaptively modulates the balance between all-pass and low-pass
filters by modifying the maximal eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian. Through
this process, AKGNN learns the optimal threshold between high and low frequency
signals to relieve the generality problem. Later, we further reduce the number
of parameters by a parameterization trick and enhance the expressive power by a
global readout function. Extensive experiments are conducted on acknowledged
benchmark datasets and promising results demonstrate the outstanding
performance of our proposed AKGNN by comparison with state-of-the-art GNNs. The

refractive index of VO2 thin film is thickness dependent, therefore, in
calculating the transmission of light spectrum from VO2 thin films, a unique

the valence bond formation in IrTe$_2$ is driven by changes in the Ir-Te-Ir

drastically, leading to a stabilization of local valence bonds large enough to
push them out of a broad band continuum. This unusual local mechanism of

learning are a few of many potential applications of high resolution generative
models. Recent progress in GANs have established them as an excellent choice
for such tasks. However, since they do not provide an inference model, image
editing or downstream tasks such as classification can not be done on real
images using the GAN latent space. Despite numerous efforts to train an
inference model or design an iterative method to invert a pre-trained

architecture (e.g. StyleGAN) specific. These methods are nontrivial to extend
to novel datasets or architectures. We propose a general framework that is
agnostic to architecture and datasets. Our key insight is that, by training the
inference and the generative model together, we allow them to adapt to each
other and to converge to a better quality model. Our \textbf{InvGAN}, short for
Invertible GAN, successfully embeds real images to the latent space of a high

research problem in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image
manipulation. Most of the existing methods that rely only on a global generator
usually suffer from changing unwanted attributes along with the target
attributes. Recently, hierarchical networks that consist of both a global
network dealing with the whole image and multiple local networks focusing on
local parts are showing success. However, these methods extract local regions
by bounding boxes centred around the sparse facial key points which are
non-differentiable, inaccurate and unrealistic. Hence, the solution becomes
sub-optimal, introduces unwanted artefacts degrading the overall quality of the
synthetic images. Moreover, a recent study has shown strong correlation between
facial attributes and local semantic regions. To exploit this relationship, we
designed a unified architecture of semantic segmentation and hierarchical GANs.
A unique advantage of our framework is that on forward pass the semantic
segmentation network conditions the generative model, and on backward pass
gradients from hierarchical GANs are propagated to the semantic segmentation
network, which makes our framework an end-to-end differentiable architecture.
This allows both architectures to benefit from each other. To demonstrate its
advantages, we evaluate our method on two challenging facial expression
translation benchmarks, AffectNet and RaFD, and a semantic segmentation
benchmark, CelebAMask-HQ across two popular architectures, BiSeNet and UNet.
Our extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on both face semantic
segmentation and face expression manipulation tasks validate the effectiveness
of our work over existing state-of-the-art methods.

of matter. Recently, intensive research has been devoted to understanding the
physical properties of the edge states at the quantum phase transitions of the
bulk topological states. A higher-order symmetry-protected topological state is
realized in a plaquette Heisenberg model on the square lattice. In its
disordered phase, the lattice with an open boundary hosts either dangling
corner states with spin-$1/2$ degeneracy characterizing the topological phase,
or nondangling corner states without degeneracy, which depends on the bond
configuration near the corners. In this work, we study the critical behavior of
these corner states at the quantum critical point (QCP), and find that the
spin-$1/2$ corner state induces a new universality class of the corner critical
behavior, which is distinct from the ordinary transition of the nondangling

horizon online resource allocation/matching problem, when the corresponding
static planning linear program (SPP) exhibits a non-degeneracy condition called
the general position gap (GPG). The key intuition that we formalize is that the
solution of the reward maximizing SPP is the same as a feasibility Linear
Program restricted to the optimal basic activities, and under GPG this solution
can be tracked with bounded regret by a greedy algorithm, i.e., without the
commonly used technique of periodically resolving the SPP.
  The goal of the decision maker is to combine resources (from a finite set of
resource types) into configurations (from a finite set of feasible
configurations) where each configuration is specified by the number of
resources consumed of each type and a reward. The resources are further
subdivided into three types - offline (whose quantity is known and available at
time 0), online-queueable (which arrive online and can be stored in a buffer),
and online-nonqueueable (which arrive online and must be matched on arrival or
lost). Under GRG we prove that, (i) our greedy algorithm gets bounded any-time
regret of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon_0)$ for matching reward ($\epsilon_0$ is a
measure of the GPG) when no configuration contains both an online-queueable and
an online-nonqueueable resource, and (ii) $\mathcal{O}(\log t)$ expected
any-time regret otherwise (we also prove a matching lower bound). By
considering the three types of resources, our matching framework encompasses
several well-studied problems such as dynamic multi-sided matching, network

important problem in neuroscience. Drift-diffusion models are popular in such

model for gradual longitudinal learning was recently developed in Paulon, et
al. (2020). Fitting drift-diffusion models however require data on both
category responses and associated response times. Category response accuracies
are, however, often the only reliable measure recorded by behavioral scientists
to describe human learning. To our knowledge, however, drift-diffusion models
for such scenarios have never been considered in the literature before. To
address this gap, in this article we build carefully on Paulon, et al. (2020),
but now with latent response times integrated out, to derive a novel
biologically interpretable class of `inverse-probit' categorical probability
models for observed categories. This marginal model, however, presents
significant identifiability and inferential challenges not encountered
originally for the joint model in Paulon, et al. (2020). We address these new
challenges via a novel projection-based approach with a symmetry-preserving
identifiability constraint that allows us to work with conjugate priors in an
unconstrained space. We adapt the model for group and individual-level
inference in longitudinal settings. Building again on the model's latent
variable representation, we design an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm for posterior computation. We evaluate the method's empirical
performances through simulation experiments. The method's practical efficacy is
illustrated in applications to longitudinal tone learning studies.

Voyager 2 flyby in 1989. Models for Triton's plumes have previously been
grouped into five hypotheses, two of which are primarily atmospheric phenomena
and are generally considered unlikely, and three of which include eruptive
processes and are plausible. These hypotheses are compared, including new
arguments, such as comparisons based on current understanding of Mars,
Enceladus, and Pluto. An eruption model based on a solar-powered, solid-state
greenhouse effect was previously considered the leading hypothesis for Triton's
plumes, in part due to the proximity of the plumes to the subsolar latitude
during the Voyager 2 flyby and the distribution of Triton's fans that are
putatively deposits from former plumes. The other two eruption hypotheses are
powered by internal heat, not solar insolation. Based on new analyses of the
ostensible relation between the latitude of the subsolar point on Triton and
the geographic locations of the plumes and fans, we argue that neither the
locations of the plumes nor fans are strong evidence in favor of the
solar-powered hypothesis. We conclude that all three eruption hypotheses should
be considered further. Five tests are presented that could be implemented with
remote sensing observations from future spacecraft to confidently distinguish
among the eruption hypotheses for Triton's plumes. The five tests are based on
the: (1) composition and thickness of Triton's southern hemisphere terrains,
(2) composition of fan deposits, (3) distribution of active plumes, (4)
distribution of fans, and (5) surface temperature at the locations of plumes
and/or fans. The tests are independent, but complementary, and implementable
with a single flyby mission such as the Trident mission concept. We note that,

effective formulation for monocular 3D object detection without exploiting any
extra information. It presents the MonoCon method which learns Monocular
Contexts, as auxiliary tasks in training, to help monocular 3D object
detection. The key idea is that with the annotated 3D bounding boxes of objects
in an image, there is a rich set of well-posed projected 2D supervision signals
available in training, such as the projected corner keypoints and their
associated offset vectors with respect to the center of 2D bounding box, which
should be exploited as auxiliary tasks in training. The proposed MonoCon is
motivated by the Cramer-Wold theorem in measure theory at a high level. In
implementation, it utilizes a very simple end-to-end design to justify the
effectiveness of learning auxiliary monocular contexts, which consists of three
components: a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based feature backbone, a number of
regression head branches for learning the essential parameters used in the 3D
bounding box prediction, and a number of regression head branches for learning
auxiliary contexts. After training, the auxiliary context regression branches
are discarded for better inference efficiency. In experiments, the proposed
MonoCon is tested in the KITTI benchmark (car, pedestrain and cyclist). It
outperforms all prior arts in the leaderboard on car category and obtains
comparable performance on pedestrian and cyclist in terms of accuracy. Thanks
to the simple design, the proposed MonoCon method obtains the fastest inference

learn on large-scale graphs. In this paper, we study the problem of training
GNNs on graphs of moderate size and transferring them to large-scale graphs. We
use graph limits called graphons to define limit objects for graph filters and
GNNs -- graphon filters and graphon neural networks (WNNs) -- which we
interpret as generative models for graph filters and GNNs. We then show that
graphon filters and WNNs can be approximated by graph filters and GNNs sampled
from them on weighted and stochastic graphs. Because the error of these
approximations can be upper bounded, by a triangle inequality argument we can
further bound the error of transferring a graph filter or a GNN across graphs.
Our results show that (i) the transference error decreases with the graph size,

helps Deformable DETR achieve 44.8 AP on the MSCOCO dataset with only 36

  To our knowledge, this is the first low regularity well-posedness result for
a quasilinear dispersive model where the nonlinearity is both rough and lacks
the decay necessary for global smoothing type estimates. These two features
pose considerable difficulty when trying to apply standard tools for closing
low-regularity estimates. While the tools developed in this article are used to

specific locations within the duct cross-section. This particle focusing is a
result of a balance between two dominant forces acting on the particle: (i) the
inertial lift force arising from small but non-negligible inertia of the fluid,
and (ii) the secondary drag force due to the cross-sectional vortices induced
by the curvature of the duct. By adopting a simplified particle dynamics model
developed by Ha et al.~[2], we investigate both analytically and numerically,
the particle equilibria and their bifurcations when a small particle is
suspended in low-flow-rate fluid flow through a curved duct having a $2\times1$
and a $1\times2$ rectangular cross-section. In certain parameter regimes of the
model, we analytically obtain the particle equilibria and deduce their
stability, while for other parameter regimes, we numerically calculate the
particle equilibria and stability. Moreover, we observe a number of different
bifurcations in particle equilibria such as saddle-node, pitchfork and Hopf, as
the model parameters are varied. These results may aid in the design of
inertial microfluidic devices aimed at particle separation by size.

Algorithm (FSLA) for bilevel optimization problems. Classic algorithms for

expensive. Recently, several single loop algorithms have been proposed with
optimizing the inner and outer variable alternatively. However, these
algorithms not yet achieve fully single loop. As they overlook the loop needed
to evaluate the hyper-gradient for a given inner and outer state. In order to
develop a fully single loop algorithm, we first study the structure of the
hyper-gradient and identify a general approximation formulation of
hyper-gradient computation that encompasses several previous common approaches,
e.g. back-propagation through time, conjugate gradient, \emph{etc.} Based on
this formulation, we introduce a new state variable to maintain the historical
hyper-gradient information. Combining our new formulation with the alternative
update of the inner and outer variables, we propose an efficient fully single
loop algorithm. We theoretically show that the error generated by the new state
can be bounded and our algorithm converges with the rate of $O(\epsilon^{-2})$.
Finally, we verify the efficacy our algorithm empirically through multiple

ReID by computing the contrastive loss between the individual features and the
cluster memory. However, existing methods that use the individual features to
momentum update the cluster memory will fluctuate over the training examples,
especially for the outlier samples. Unlike the individual-based updating
mechanism, the centroid-based updating mechanism that applies the mean feature
of each cluster to update the cluster memory can reduce the impact of
individual samples. Therefore, we formulate the individual-based updating and
centroid-based updating mechanisms in a unified cluster contrastive framework,
named Dual Cluster Contrastive framework (DCC), which maintains two types of
memory banks: individual and centroid cluster memory banks. Significantly, the
individual cluster memory considers just one individual at a time to take a
single step for updating. The centroid cluster memory applies the mean feature
of each cluster to update the corresponding cluster memory. During
optimization, besides the vallina contrastive loss of each memory, a cross-view
consistency constraint is applied to exchange the benefits of two memories for
generating a discriminative description for the object ReID. Note that DCC can
be easily applied for unsupervised or supervised object ReID by using
ground-truth labels or the generated pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on

follows:
  1) Many rocky planets may form with initial H$_2$-He envelopes that are later
lost to space, likely due to a combination of stellar UV/X-ray irradiation and
internal heating.
  2) After the early stages of evolution, a wide diversity of atmospheric
compositions is expected, due to variations in host star flux, atmospheric
escape rates, interior exchange and other factors.
  3) Observations have ruled out the presence of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres
on several nearby rocky exoplanets, and the presence of any thick atmosphere on
one target. More detailed atmospheric characterization of these planets and
others will become possible in the near future.
  4) Exoplanet biosphere searches are an exciting future goal. However,
reliable detections for a representative sample of planets will require further

diagram of the two-orbital Hubbard model with interorbital hopping ($t_{12})$,

We find that the negative interorbital hopping ($t_{12}<0$) can enhance the
OSMP regime upon tuning the effective bandwidth ratio. On the contrary, for the
cases with positive interorbital hopping ($t_{12}>0$), the OSMP region becomes
narrow with the increase of orbital hybridization until it disappears. It is
also shown that a new OSMP emerges for a large enough positive interorbital
hopping, owing to the role exchange of wide and narrow effective orbitals
caused by the large $t_{12}$. Our results are also applicable to the

adaptation (OSUDA) for semantic segmentation where the segmentors only see one
unlabeled target image during training. In this case, traditional unsupervised
domain adaptation models usually fail since they cannot adapt to the target
domain with over-fitting to one (or few) target samples. To address this
problem, existing OSUDA methods usually integrate a style-transfer module to
perform domain randomization based on the unlabeled target sample, with which
multiple domains around the target sample can be explored during training.
However, such a style-transfer module relies on an additional set of images as
style reference for pre-training and also increases the memory demand for
domain adaptation. Here we propose a new OSUDA method that can effectively
relieve such computational burden. Specifically, we integrate several
style-mixing layers into the segmentor which play the role of style-transfer
module to stylize the source images without introducing any learned parameters.
Moreover, we propose a patchwise prototypical matching (PPM) method to weighted
consider the importance of source pixels during the supervised training to
relieve the negative adaptation. Experimental results show that our method
achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used benchmarks for
domain adaptive semantic segmentation under the one-shot setting and is more
efficient than all comparison approaches.

DualFormer, which can efficiently perform space-time attention for video

into dual cascaded levels, i.e., to first learn fine-grained local interactions
among nearby 3D tokens, and then to capture coarse-grained global dependencies
between the query token and global pyramid contexts. Different from existing
methods that apply space-time factorization or restrict attention computations
within local windows for improving efficiency, our local-global stratification
strategy can well capture both short- and long-range spatiotemporal
dependencies, and meanwhile greatly reduces the number of keys and values in
attention computation to boost efficiency. Experimental results verify the
superiority of DualFormer on five video benchmarks against existing methods. In

late-type L dwarf co-moving with the young K0 star BD+60 1417 at a projected
separation of 37"" or 1662 AU. The secondary - CWISER J124332.12+600126.2
(W1243) - is detected in both the CatWISE2020 and 2MASS reject tables. The
photometric distance and CatWISE proper motion both match that of the primary
within ~1sigma and our estimates for chance alignment yield a zero probability.
Follow-up near infrared spectroscopy reveals W1243 to be a very red 2MASS
color(J-Ks=2.72), low-surface gravity source that we classify as L6 - L8gamma.
Its spectral morphology strongly resembles that of confirmed late-type L dwarfs
in 10 - 150 Myr moving groups as well as that of planetary mass companions. The
position on near- and mid-infrared color-magnitude diagrams indicates the
source is redder and fainter than the field sequence, a telltale sign of an
object with thick clouds and a complex atmosphere. For the primary we obtained
new optical spectroscopy and analyzed all available literature information for
youth indicators. We conclude that the Li I abundance, its loci on
color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, and the rotation rate revealed in
multiple TESS sectors are all consistent with an age of 50 - 150 Myr. Using our
re-evaluated age of the primary, the Gaia parallax along with the photometry
and spectrum for W1243 we find a Teff=1303+/-31 K, logg=4.3+/-0.17 cm s-2, and
a mass of 15+/-5 MJup. We find a physical separation of ~1662 AU and a mass
ratio of ~0.01 for this system. Placing it in context with the diverse
collection of binary stars, brown dwarf and planetary companions, the BD+60
1417 system falls in a sparsely sampled area where the formation pathway is
difficult to assess.

However, most of the methods are generally designed on the RGB image domain.
Due to the discrepancy between the two-dimensional image plane and the

information and serve as sub-optimal solutions for 3D-related tasks. To bridge
this gap, we aim to learn a spatial-aware visual representation that can
describe the three-dimensional space and is more suitable and effective for
these tasks. To leverage point clouds, which are much more superior in
providing spatial information compared to images, we propose a simple yet
effective 2D Image and 3D Point cloud Unsupervised pre-training strategy,
called SimIPU. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal contrastive learning
framework that consists of an intra-modal spatial perception module to learn a
spatial-aware representation from point clouds and an inter-modal feature
interaction module to transfer the capability of perceiving spatial information
from the point cloud encoder to the image encoder, respectively. Positive pairs
for contrastive losses are established by the matching algorithm and the
projection matrix. The whole framework is trained in an unsupervised end-to-end
fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore
contrastive learning pre-training strategies for outdoor multi-modal datasets,

optimize urban traffic and reduce local carbon emissions. In order to cut
carbon emissions and maximize the utility of electric buses, it is important to
choose suitable routes for them. Traditionally, route selection is on the basis
of dedicated surveys, which are costly in time and labor. In this paper, we
mainly focus attention on planning electric bus routes intelligently, depending
on the unique needs of each region throughout the city. We propose
Clairvoyance, a route planning system that leverages a deep neural network and
a multilayer perceptron to predict the future people's trips and the future
transportation carbon emission in the whole city, respectively. Given the
future information of people's trips and transportation carbon emission, we
utilize a greedy mechanism to recommend bus routes for electric buses that will
depart in an ideal state. Furthermore, representative features of the two
neural networks are extracted from the heterogeneous urban datasets. We
evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world data sources

the recommended routes for electric buses are helpful in reducing the peak

considering both departure time and route choices, and a dynamic queuing model
is designed to describe the EV queuing behaviors at fast charging stations
(FCSs). Then, the charging load fluctuation toll is designed as an ancillary
toll at FCSs and the bus voltage deviation penalty is considered in optimal
power flow to guide the interaction of two networks and tackle the voltage
deviation issue. Moreover, the equilibrium state is designed as a fixed-point
problem and the solution's existence is proved under mild assumptions. Third,
the linearization and convex relaxation techniques are used to improve
computational efficiency and a Monte Carlo simulation technique is developed to
evaluate the influence of uncertain travel demands on coupled networks.
Numerical simulations of coupled networks interaction analyses in deterministic

CWS-PResUNet utilizes a channel-wise subband (CWS) feature to limit unnecessary

mixed-autonomy ring roads as depictions of instabilities that result in the

all clusters with relaxation times of the order of their ages or longer have
little to no mass segregation. For each cluster, the amount of mass segregation
seen is fully compatible with the amount expected by dynamical evolution from
initially unsegregated clusters, showing that globular clusters formed without
primordial mass segregation among their low-mass stars. Ultra-faint dwarf
galaxy candidates split into two groups, star clusters which follow the same
trend between relaxation time and amount of mass segregation as globular
clusters and dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies that are unsegregated despite
having relaxation times smaller than a Hubble time. Stellar abundance and
velocity dispersion data, where available, confirm our classification. After
classification of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidates, we find that outer

the magnitudes and signs of the exchange interactions, but also their bond
anisotropy even without the bond-anisotropic hopping integrals. Because of this
property, the honeycomb-network spin system could be transformed into weakly
coupled zigzag or step spin chains for the light field polarized along the $b$-

determine the coherence cost of preparing a general state when there are no

as the minimum rate of consumption of systems in a pure coherent state, that is
needed to prepare copies of the desired system. We show that the coherence cost

we design a new adaptive SCL-Flip (AD-SCLF) decoder, which can be easily
implemented based on existing SCL-Flip techniques. Simulation results showed
that the AD-SCLF can reduce up to 80.85\% of the computational complexity of a
current SCL-Flip decoder at a matched $FER=10^{-3}$. The result implies our
decoder can significantly reduce the energy consumption caused by redundant
re-decoding attempts from the SCL-Flip decoder.

consider a hierarchical model of fog devices, where the computation power of

tiers. However, the higher tier fog devices are located at greater physical
distance from data generation sources as compared to lower tier fog devices.
Jobs with varying granularity and cpu requirements have been considered. In
general, jobs with modest cpu requirements are scheduled on lower tier fog
devices, and jobs with larger cpu requirements are scheduled on higher tier fog
devices or the cloud data center $(cdc)$. The performance of $FiFSA$ and $EFSA$
has been evaluated using a real life workload trace on various simulated fog
hierarchies as well as on a prototype testbed. Employing $FiFSA$ offers an
average improvement of 27% and 57.9% in total completion time and an

  Regularization",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Despite overparameterization, deep networks trained via supervised learning
are easy to optimize and exhibit excellent generalization. One hypothesis to
explain this is that overparameterized deep networks enjoy the benefits of
implicit regularization induced by stochastic gradient descent, which favors
parsimonious solutions that generalize well on test inputs. It is reasonable to
surmise that deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods could also benefit from
this effect. In this paper, we discuss how the implicit regularization effect
of SGD seen in supervised learning could in fact be harmful in the offline deep
RL setting, leading to poor generalization and degenerate feature
representations. Our theoretical analysis shows that when existing models of
implicit regularization are applied to temporal difference learning, the
resulting derived regularizer favors degenerate solutions with excessive
""aliasing"", in stark contrast to the supervised learning case. We back up these
findings empirically, showing that feature representations learned by a deep
network value function trained via bootstrapping can indeed become degenerate,
aliasing the representations for state-action pairs that appear on either side
of the Bellman backup. To address this issue, we derive the form of this
implicit regularizer and, inspired by this derivation, propose a simple and
effective explicit regularizer, called DR3, that counteracts the undesirable
effects of this implicit regularizer. When combined with existing offline RL
methods, DR3 substantially improves performance and stability, alleviating
unlearning in Atari 2600 games, D4RL domains and robotic manipulation from

Furthermore, we construct a differentiable strategy to cooperatively search

phases after the initial one. However, we find that improving CIL at its
initial phase is also a promising direction. Specifically, we experimentally
show that directly encouraging CIL Learner at the initial phase to output
similar representations as the model jointly trained on all classes can greatly
boost the CIL performance. Motivated by this, we study the difference between a
na\""ively-trained initial-phase model and the oracle model. Specifically, since
one major difference between these two models is the number of training
classes, we investigate how such difference affects the model representations.
We find that, with fewer training classes, the data representations of each
class lie in a long and narrow region; with more training classes, the
representations of each class scatter more uniformly. Inspired by this
observation, we propose Class-wise Decorrelation (CwD) that effectively
regularizes representations of each class to scatter more uniformly, thus
mimicking the model jointly trained with all classes (i.e., the oracle model).
Our CwD is simple to implement and easy to plug into existing methods.
Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that CwD consistently

that different tasks can share a low-rank common yet latent subspace. It means
learning multiple tasks jointly is better than learning them independently. In
this paper, we propose two novel multi-task learning formulations based on two
regularization terms, which can learn the optimal shared latent subspace by
minimizing the exactly $k$ minimal singular values. The proposed regularization
terms are the more tight approximations of rank minimization than trace norm.
But it's an NP-hard problem to solve the exact rank minimization problem.
Therefore, we design a novel re-weighted based iterative strategy to solve our

setting a large penalizing parameter. Experimental results on benchmark

lack of training data in low-resource languages. The recent approaches use
training data only in a resource-rich language like English to fine-tune
large-scale cross-lingual pre-trained language models. Due to the big
difference between languages, a model fine-tuned only by a source language may
not perform well for target languages. Interestingly, we observe that while the
top-1 results predicted by the previous approaches may often fail to hit the
ground-truth answers, the correct answers are often contained in the top-k
predicted results. Based on this observation, we develop a two-stage approach
to enhance the model performance. The first stage targets at recall: we design
a hard-learning (HL) algorithm to maximize the likelihood that the top-k
predictions contain the accurate answer. The second stage focuses on precision:
an answer-aware contrastive learning (AA-CL) mechanism is developed to learn
the fine difference between the accurate answer and other candidates. Our
extensive experiments show that our model significantly outperforms a series of
strong baselines on two cross-lingual MRC benchmark datasets.

surfaces have still not been investigated to a large extent. We use numerical
simulations to study conjugate heat transfer of liquid-filled grooves. It is
shown that heat transfer can increase for both laminar and turbulent liquid
flows due to recirculation in the surface texture. For the increase to be
substantial, the thermal conductivity of the solid must be similar to the
thermal conductivity of the fluids, and the recirculation in the grooves must
be sufficiently strong (P\'eclet number larger than 1). The ratio of the
surface cavity to the system height is an upper limit of the direct
contribution from the recirculation. While this ratio can be significant for
laminar flows in microchannels, it is limited for turbulent flows, where the
system scale (e.g. channel height) usually is much larger than the texture
height. However, heat transfer enhancement on the order of $10\%$ is observed
(with a net drag reduction) in a turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds
number $Re_\tau \approx 180$. It is shown that the turbulent convection in the
bulk can be enhanced indirectly from the recirculation in the grooves.

for initiating effective emergency response actions. Remotely sensed very high
spatial resolution (VHR) imagery can provide vital information due to their
ability to map the affected buildings with high geometric precision. Many
approaches have been developed to detect damaged buildings due to earthquakes.
However, little attention has been paid to exploiting rich features represented
in VHR images using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This paper presents a novel
superpixel based approach combining DNN and a modified segmentation method, to
detect damaged buildings from VHR imagery. Firstly, a modified Fast Scanning
and Adaptive Merging method is extended to create initial over-segmentation.
Secondly, the segments are merged based on the Region Adjacent Graph (RAG),
considered an improved semantic similarity criterion composed of Local Binary
Patterns (LBP) texture, spectral, and shape features. Thirdly, a pre-trained
DNN using Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders called SDAE-DNN is presented, to
exploit the rich semantic features for building damage detection. Deep-layer
feature abstraction of SDAE-DNN could boost detection accuracy through learning
more intrinsic and discriminative features, which outperformed other methods
using state-of-the-art alternative classifiers. We demonstrate the feasibility
and effectiveness of our method using a subset of WorldView-2 imagery, in the

to a great variety of applications. Local differential privacy (LDP), as an
emerging standard that is suitable for PPDA, has been widely deployed into
various real-world scenarios to analyze massive data while protecting against
many forms of privacy breach. In this study, we are mainly concerned with
piecewise transformation technique (PTT) for analyzing numerical data under
local differential privacy. We provide a principled framework for PTT in the
context of LDP, based on which PTT is studied systematically. As a result, we
show that (1) many members in PTTs are asymptotically optimal when used to
obtain an unbiased estimator for mean of numerical data, and (2) for a given
privacy budget, there is PTT that reaches the theoretical low bound with
respect to variance. Next, we prove by studying two classes of PTTs in detail
that (1) there do not exist optimal PTTs compared to the well-used technique,
i.e., Duchi's scheme, in terms of the consistency noisy variance, (2) on the
other hand, one has the ability to find a great number of PTTs that are
consistently more optimal than the latter with regard to the worst-case noisy
variance, which is never reported so far. When we are restricted to consider
only the high privacy level, enough PTTs turn out to be optimal than the
well-known Laplace mechanism. Lastly, we prove that for a family of PTTs, the
correspondingly theoretical low bound of noisy variance follows
$O(\epsilon^{-2})$ when considering the high privacy level.

controversial. This is in part owed to the ambiguity of electrochemical
parameters of the mechanism such as the Tafel slope and reaction orders. We
took the most commonly assumed adsorbate mechanism and calculated the Tafel
slopes and reaction orders with respect to pH based on microkinetic analysis.
We demonstrate that number of possible Tafel slopes strongly depends on a
number of preceding steps and surface coverage. Furthermore, the Tafel slope
becomes pH dependent when the coverage of intermediates changes with pH. These
insights complicate the identification of a rate-limiting step by a single
Tafel slope at a single pH. Yet, simulations of reaction orders complementary
to Tafel slopes can solve some ambiguities to distinguish between possible
rate-limiting steps. The most insightful information can be obtained from the
low overpotential region of the Tafel plot. The simulations in this work
provide clear guidelines to experimentalists for the identification of the
limiting steps in the adsorbate mechanism using the observed values of the
Tafel slope and reaction order in pH-dependent studies.

electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, most of their
performance largely lags behind noble metals such as benchmark platinum (Pt).
In this work, a Pd(20nm)/SnTe(70nm) heterostructure, fabricated by molecular
beam epitaxy and electron beam evaporation, is found to display much higher
electrocatalytic activity than that of a pure Pd(20nm) thin film and even
higher than that of a commercial Pt foil. This heterostructure adopts an
extracted turnover frequency value more than two times higher than that of the
Pd(20nm) thin film at a potential of 0.2 V, indicating a much higher intrinsic
activity per Pd site. Density functional theory calculations show that the
conventional d-band theory, which works well for many transition metal
heterostructures, cannot explain the enhancement of electrocatalytic
performance. Instead, we found that the topological surface states (TSSs) of
the SnTe (001) underlayer play a key role; electrons transfer from both the Pd
surface and the adsorbed H atoms to the TSSs of SnTe (001), resulting in weaker
Pd-H binding strength and more favorable hydrogen adsorption free energies. Our
work demonstrates for the first time that a metal/topological quantum material
heterostructure could be a prominent catalyst to enjoy HER activity
outperforming that of a commercial Pt foil and offers a promising direction to
optimize the performance of electrocatalysts based on topological quantum

the degree of current rectification. As the choice of Fermi energy is crucial
for obtaining significant current rectification, explicit dependence of Fermi
energy on the degree of current rectification is also studied for a particular
shape of the nanopore. Finally, the role of nanopore size and different spatial
distributions of the electrostatic potential profile across the GNR are
discussed. Given the simplicity of the proposed method and promising results,
the present proposition may lead to a new route of getting current
rectification in different kinds of materials where nanopores can be formed
selectively.

  Structure Convolutions for Risky Seller Detection",,,,,"cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  A payment network contains transactions between sellers and buyers. Detecting
risky (or bad) sellers on such a payment network is crucial to payment service
providers for risk management and legal compliance. In this research, we
formulate this task as a node classification task. Specifically, we aim to
predict a label for each seller in a payment network, by analysing its
properties and/or interactions. Nodes residing in different parts of a payment
network can have similar local topology structures. Such local topology
structures reveal sellers' business roles, eg., supplier, drop-shipper, or
retailer. We note that many existing solutions for graph-based node
classification only consider node connectivity but not the similarity between
node's local topology structure. Motivated by business need, we present a
dual-path graph convolution network, named DP-GCN, for node classification.
DP-GCN considers both node connectivity and topology structure similarity. The
proposed model consists of three main modules: (i) a C-GCN module to capture
connectivity relationships between nodes, (ii) a T-GCN module to capture
topology structure similarities between nodes, and (iii) a multi-head
self-attention module to align both properties. We evaluate DP-GCN on seven
benchmark datasets against diverse baselines. We also provide a case study of
running DP-GCN on three large-scale payment networks from PayPal, one of the
leading payment service providers. Experimental results demonstrate DP-GCN's
effectiveness and practicability.

amount of labeled data needed would exceed dimensions of present day technical

redundancy along with the proof of sufficient subsystems' performances. As it
is known, this strategy is efficient especially for the case of subsystems
operating independently, i.e. the occurrence of errors is independent in a
statistical sense. Here, we give some first considerations and experimental
evidence that this strategy is not a free ride as the errors of neural networks
fulfilling the same computer vision task, at least for some cases, show
correlated occurrences of errors. This remains true, if training data,
architecture, and training are kept separate or independence is trained using
special loss functions. Using data from different sensors (realized by up to
five 2D projections of the 3D MNIST data set) in our experiments is more
efficiently reducing correlations, however not to an extent that is realizing
the potential of reduction of testing data that can be obtained for redundant

time interval between 1.3 and 370 days after the burst, in the observer frame.
We find that the afterglow emission can be modelled with a forward shock
propagating in a uniform medium modified by time-variable extinction along the
line of sight. A jet break could be present after 7 rest-frame days, and
accordingly the maximum luminosity of the underlying SN ranges between that of
stripped-envelope corecollapse supernovae (SNe) of intermediate luminosity, and
that of the luminous GRB-associated SN2013dx. The observed spectral absorption
lines of SN2019jrj are not as broad as in classical GRB-SNe, and are rather
more similar to those of less-luminous core-collapse SNe. Taking the
broad-lined stripped-envelope core-collapse SN2004aw as an analogue, we
tentatively derive the basic physical properties of SN2019jrj. We discuss the
possibility that a fraction of the TeV emission of this source might have had a
hadronic origin and estimate the expected high-energy neutrino detection level

substantially improve the generalization of 3D object detectors to

domain labels for the training data samples, and instead only have an
aggregated collection of training points. Existing approaches that utilize
domain labels to create domain-invariant feature representations are
inapplicable in this setting, requiring alternative approaches to learn

these pseudo-domains we learn a domain-adaptive classifier that makes
predictions using information about both the input and the pseudo-domain it

(GRDs), which can detect gamma-rays and particles and can roughly localize the
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). GRD was designed using lanthanum bromide (LaBr3)
crystal as the sensitive material with the rear end coupled with silicon
photomultiplier (SiPM) array for readout. Purpose: In aerospace engineering
design of GRD, there are many key points to be studied. In this paper, we
present the specific design scheme of GRD, the assembly and the performance
test results of detectors. Methods: Based on Monte Carlo simulation and
experimental test results, the specific schematic design and assembling process
ofGRDwere optimized. After being fully assembled, theGRDswere conducted
performance tests by using radioactive source and also conducted random
vibration tests. Result and conclusion: The test results show that all
satellite-borne GRDs have energy resolution <16% at 59.5 keV, meeting
requirements of satellite in scientific performance. The random vibration test
shows that GRD can maintain in a stable performance, which meets the
requirement of spatial application.

All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is primarily designed to spot gamma-ray bursts
corresponding to gravitational waves. In order to achieve stable observations
from various astronomical phenomena, the payload performance need to be
monitored during the in-orbit operation. Method This article describes the
design and implementation of GECAM satellite payload performance monitoring
(GPPM) software. The software extracts the payload status and telescope
observations (light curves, energy spectrums, characteristic peak fitting of
energy spectrums, etc) from the payload data. Considering the large amount of
payload status parameters in the engineering data, we have designed a method of
parameter processing based on the configuration tables. This method can deal
with the frequent changes of the data formats and facilitate program
maintenance. Payload status and performance are monitored through defined
thresholds and monitoring reports. The entire software is implemented in python
language and the huge amount of observation data is stored in MongoDB.
Conclusion The design and implementation of GPPM software have been completed,
tested with ground and in-orbit payload data. The software can monitor the
performance of GECAM payload effectively. The overall design of the software
and the data processing method can be applied to other satellites.

believed to be produced by some quenching processes, such as the feedback from
active galactic nuclei. We perform an analysis of weak lensing and satellite
kinematics for SDSS central galaxies. Our results reveal that the efficiency is
much higher, more than sixty percent, for a large population of massive

investigated in statistical and machine learning communities due to its
robustness to outliers and heavy-tailed noises. Understanding modal
regression's theoretical behavior can be fundamental in learning theory.
Despite significant progress in characterizing its statistical property, the
majority of the results are based on the assumption that samples are
independent and identical distributed (i.i.d.), which is too restrictive for
real-world applications. This paper concerns the statistical property of
regularized modal regression (RMR) within an important dependence structure -
Markov dependent. Specifically, we establish the upper bound for RMR estimator
under moderate conditions and give an explicit learning rate. Our results show
that the Markov dependence impacts on the generalization error in the way that
sample size would be discounted by a multiplicative factor depending on the
spectral gap of underlying Markov chain. This result shed a new light on
characterizing the theoretical underpinning for robust regression.

robustness of superconductivity in an ideal two-dimensional (2D) system was an
intriguing fact that defied the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Here, we took advantage
of the high sensitivity of scanning SQUID susceptometry to image the phase
stiffness throughout the phase transition of Bi2212 in the 2D limit. We found
susceptibility oscillated with flux between diamagnetism and paramagnetism in a
Fraunhofer-like pattern up till $T_C$. The temperature and sample
size-dependence of the modulation period agreed well with our Coulomb gas
analogy of a finite 2D system based on Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
transition. In the multilayers, the susceptibility oscillation differed in a
small temperature regime below $T_C$ in consistent with a dimensional-crossover
led by interlayer coupling. Serving as strong evidence of BKT transition in the
bulk, there appeared a sharp superfluid density jump at zero-field and
paramagnetism at small fields just below $T_C$. These results unified the phase
transitions from the monolayer Bi2212 to the bulk as BKT transition with finite
interlayer coupling. This elucidating picture favored the pre-formed pairs
scenario for the underdoped cuprates regardless of lattice dimensionality.

polarized manifold X was established by Aubin and Yau already in the 70s there
are only a few explicit formulas available. In previous work a probabilistic
construction of the K\""ahler-Einstein metric was introduced - involving
canonical random point processes on X - which yields canonical approximations
of the K\""ahler-Einstein metric, expressed as explicit period integrals over a
large number of products of X. Here it is shown that the conjectural extension
to the case when X is a Fano variety suggests a zero-free property of the
Archimedean zeta functions defined by the partition functions of the
probabilistic model. A weaker zero-free property is also shown to be relevant
for the Calabi-Yau equation. The convergence in the case of log Fano curves is
settled, exploiting relations to the complex Selberg integral in the orbifold
case. Some intriguing relations to the zero-free property of the local
automorphic L-functions appearing in the Langlands program and arithmetic
geometry are also pointed out. These relations also suggest a natural p-adic
extension of the probabilistic approach.

operation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) complex. The LHC internal beam
dump (LHC Target Dump Injection or LHC TDI) is the main protection BID of the
LHC injection system; its main function is to protect LHC equipment in the
event of a malfunction of the injection kicker magnets during beam transfer
from the SPS to the LHC. Several issues with the TDI were encountered during
LHC operation, most of them due to outgassing from its core components induced
by electron cloud effects, which led to limitations of the injector intensity
and hence had an impact on LHC availability. The absorbing cores of the TDIs,
and of beam intercepting devices in general, need to deal with high
thermo-mechanical loads induced by the high intensity particle beams. In
addition, devices such as the TDI - where the absorbing materials are installed
close to the beam, are important contributors to the accelerator impedance
budget. To reduce impedance, the absorbing materials that make up the core must
be typically coated with high electrical conductivity metals. Beam impact
testing of the coated absorbers is a crucial element of development work to
ensure their correct operation. The behaviour of several metal-coated absorber
materials was investigated when exposed to high intensity and high energy
proton beams in the HiRadMat facility at CERN. Different coating configurations
based on copper and molybdenum, and absorbing materials such as isostatic
graphite, Carbon Fibre Composite (CfC) and Silicon Carbide reinforced with
Silicon Carbide fibres (SiC-SiC), were tested in the facility to assess the
TDI's performance and to extract information for other BIDs using these
materials. In addition to beam impact tests and an extensive Post Irradiation
Examination (PIE) campaign, extensive numerical simulations were carried out.

parity-violating Nieh-Yan term results in the velocity birefringence of
gravitational waves (GWs) and triggers the tachyonic instability only for one
of the two circular polarization states. We consider that the inflaton is
identified as the coupled axion-like field with a wiggly potential
characterized by steep cliffs connected by smooth plateaus. During inflation,
the temporary fast roll of axion on the cliff-like region leads to the
significant enhancement of the tensor perturbations in one polarization state
with the wave numbers that exit the horizon around this period. In this setup,
the resulting energy spectrum for GWs presents a sizable localized bump
involving the contribution of only one polarization state. This chiral GW

associated with suicide rates, with some content characteristics likely having
harmful and others potentially protective effects. Although good evidence
exists for a few selected characteristics, systematic large scale
investigations are missing in general, and in particular for social media data.
We apply machine learning methods to classify large quantities of Twitter data
according to a novel annotation scheme that distinguishes 12 categories of
suicide-related tweets. We then trained a benchmark of machine learning models
including a majority classifier, an approach based on word frequency (TF-IDF
with a linear SVM) and two state-of-the-art deep learning models (BERT, XLNet).
The two deep learning models achieved the best performance in two
classification tasks: In the first task, we classified six main content
categories, including personal stories about either suicidal ideation and
attempts or coping, calls for action intending to spread either problem
awareness or prevention-related information, reporting of suicide cases, and
other tweets irrelevant to these categories. The deep learning models reached
accuracy scores above 73% on average across the six categories, and F1-scores
in between 0.70 and 0.85 for all but the suicidal ideation and attempts
category (0.51-0.55). In the second task, separating tweets referring to actual
suicide from off-topic tweets, they correctly labeled around 88% of tweets,
with BERT achieving F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.74 for the two categories,
respectively. These classification performances are comparable to the
state-of-the-art on similar tasks. By making data labeling more efficient, this
work has enabled large-scale investigations on harmful and protective

implementing variable feedback for efficient control of the excitation level of

central wavelength with 1.5 nJ output pulse energy. By combining the nonlinear
Shrodinger equation and population inversion rate equations for the gain
medium, the developed numerical model helps to unveil nonlinear pulse evolution
under the influence of dynamically varying gain spectrum. The resulting laser
system presents a compact and straightforward approach to achieve laser
generation with a broad range tuneability of wavelength and operation regimes,

the sensitivities of future observatories POEMMA and GRAND for indirect dark

domains are strongly affected by irregular variations. However, the mean curves
are remarkably stable and qualitatively similar in both domains. This means
that the IR flux of the system originates not only from the free-free radiation
of the WR wind but also from a compact IR source located near the relativistic
companion. The shape of the mean X-ray and IR light curves suggest the
existence of two additional structures in the WR wind - a bow shock near the
relativistic companion and a so-called ""clumpy trail"" (Vilhu et al. 2013).
Modeling of the mean X-ray and IR light curves allowed us to obtain important
system parameters: the orbital phase of the superior conjunction of the
relativistic companion $\phi_0=-0.066\pm 0.006$, the orbital inclination angle
$i=29.5^\circ\pm 1.2^\circ$, and the WR mass-loss rate $\dot{M} = (0.96\pm
0.14)\times 10^{-5}\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$. By using relations between $\dot{M}$
and the rate of the period change and between $\dot{M}$ and the WR mass, we
estimated the probable mass of the relativistic companion $M_{\rm C}\simeq
7.2\rm M_\odot$ which points towards the black hole hypothesis. However, this
estimate is based on the assumption of a smooth WR wind. Considering the
uncertainty associated with clumping, the mass-loss rate can be lower which

($\sim10^{4}$ K and $\sim 10^{10-11}$ cm$^{-3}$), sometimes leading to coronal
mass ejections (CMEs) that directly affect the Earth's environment.
`Superflares' are found on some active solar-type (G-type main-sequence) stars,
but the association of filament eruptions/CMEs has not been established. Here
we show that our optical spectroscopic observation of the young solar-type star
EK Draconis reveals the evidence for a stellar filament eruption associated
with a superflare. This superflare emitted a radiated energy of
$2.0\times10^{33}$ erg, and blue-shifted hydrogen absorption component with a
large velocity of $-510$ km s$^{-1}$ was observed shortly after. The temporal
changes in the spectra greatly resemble those of solar filament eruptions.
Comparing this eruption with solar filament eruptions in terms of the length
scale and velocity strongly suggests that a stellar CME occurred. The erupted
filament mass of $1.1\times10^{18}$ g is 10 times larger than those of the
largest solar CMEs. The massive filament eruption and an associated CME provide
the opportunity to evaluate how they affect the environment of young
exoplanets/young Earth and stellar mass/angular-momentum evolution.

routinely traverse a variety of unstructured terrains. However, while gaits can
be varied typically by selecting from a range of pre-computed styles, current
planners are unable to vary key gait parameters continuously while the robot is
in motion. The synthesis, on-the-fly, of gaits with unexpected operational
characteristics or even the blending of dynamic manoeuvres lies beyond the
capabilities of the current state-of-the-art. In this work we address this
limitation by learning a latent space capturing the key stance phases of a
particular gait, via a generative model trained on a single trot style. This
encourages disentanglement such that application of a drive signal to a single
dimension of the latent state induces holistic plans synthesising a continuous
variety of trot styles. In fact properties of this drive signal map directly to
gait parameters such as cadence, footstep height and full stance duration. The
use of a generative model facilitates the detection and mitigation of
disturbances to provide a versatile and robust planning framework. We evaluate
our approach on a real ANYmal quadruped robot and demonstrate that our method
achieves a continuous blend of dynamic trot styles whilst being robust and
reactive to external perturbations.

simultaneously support retrieving related companies, technologies related to a
specific company and companies relevant to a technology. To evaluate these

entities extracted from these documents together with company categories and

processes where two or more proteins physically bind together to achieve their

vaccine design, antibody therapeutics, and peptide drug discovery. Pre-training
a protein model to learn effective representation is critical for PPIs. Most
pre-training models for PPIs are sequence-based, which naively adopt the
language models used in natural language processing to amino acid sequences.
More advanced works utilize the structure-aware pre-training technique, taking
advantage of the contact maps of known protein structures. However, neither
sequences nor contact maps can fully characterize structures and functions of
the proteins, which are closely related to the PPI problem. Inspired by this
insight, we propose a multimodal protein pre-training model with three
modalities: sequence, structure, and function (S2F). Notably, instead of using
contact maps to learn the amino acid-level rigid structures, we encode the
structure feature with the topology complex of point clouds of heavy atoms. It
allows our model to learn structural information about not only the backbones
but also the side chains. Moreover, our model incorporates the knowledge from
the functional description of proteins extracted from literature or manual

achieve good performances on a variety of PPIs tasks, including cross-species

extremely strong compared to older planets. In turn, stellar winds are faster
and denser for young stars compared to evolved main-sequence stars. Their
interaction with escaping planetary atmospheres can substantially affect
atmospheric mass loss rates, as well as the observable signatures of escaping
atmospheres, with both effects expected to occur differently for young and
evolved planets. We perform a comparative study of two systems around stars of
similar masses but very different ages (50~Myr and 9~Gyr): TOI-942 and TOI-421.
Both stars host two sub-Neptune-like planets at similar orbits and in similar
mass ranges, which allows a direct comparison of the atmospheric escape and

measurements of $K^{*0}$ and $\phi$ vector mesons in heavy-ion and pp
collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. Measurements in $e^+e^-$ collisions at LEP
energies are also discussed. Spin alignment of vector mesons are studied by
measuring the second diagonal element $\rho_{00}$ of spin density matrix. The
$\rho_{00}$ is obtained by measuring the angular distribution of vector meson
decay daughter with respect to the quantization axis in vector meson rest
frame. Measured $\rho_{00}$ values for vector mesons are found to be larger
than 1/3 at high momentum in $e^+e^-$ collisions at LEP energies, suggesting
the preferential production of vector meson with helicity zero state from the
fragmentation process. The $\rho_{00}$ values are found to be smaller than 1/3
($\rho_{00}$ = 1/3 implies no spin alignment) for $K^{*0}$ and $\phi$ vector
mesons at low transverse momentum in Pb--Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. This observations are qualitatively
consistent with the expectation from models which attribute the spin alignment
effect due to polarization of quarks in the presence of large initial angular
momentum in non-central heavy-ion collisions and its subsequent hadronization
by the process of recombination. No significant spin alignment effect is
observed for $K^0_S$ (spin = 0) in mid-central Pb--Pb collisions and for vector
mesons in pp collisions. However, the preliminary results of $\rho_{00}$ for
$\phi$ mesons are larger than 1/3 at intermediate $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ in Au--Au
collisions at RHIC energies and can be attributed to the presence of $\phi$
meson field. Although there is evidence of spin alignment effect of vector
mesons in heavy-ion collisions but the measured effect is surprisingly larger
in context of hyperon polarization. Therefore these results will trigger
further theoretical study.

constant speeds. The server spends an exponentially distributed amount of time
in each queue. After the completion of such a visit time to one queue, the
server instantly switches to the other queue, i.e., there is no switchover
time.

stationary marginal fluid content/workload at each queue. Subsequently, we
derive a functional equation for the LST of the two-dimensional workload
distribution that leads to a Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem (BVP).
After taking a heavy-traffic limit, and restricting ourselves to the symmetric
case, the boundary value problem simplifies and can be solved explicitly.

process-limit of the joint workload in heavy traffic. Again solving a BVP, we
determine the stationary distribution of the limiting process. We show that, in
the symmetric case, this distribution coincides with our earlier solution of
the BVP, implying that in this case the two limits (stationarity and heavy
traffic) commute.

applications to continuum physics, such a field describes physical properties
of a homogeneous and isotropic continuous medium in the situation, when a
microstructure is attached to all medium points. The range of the field is the
fixed point set of a symmetry class, where two compact Lie groups act by
orthogonal representations. The material symmetry group of a homogeneous medium
is the same at each point and acts trivially, while the group of physical
symmetries may act nontrivially. In an isotropic random medium, the rank 1

  Vision Workshops, WACV Workshops 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is challenging to derive explainability for unsupervised or
statistical-based face image quality assessment (FIQA) methods. In this work,
we propose a novel set of explainability tools to derive reasoning for
different FIQA decisions and their face recognition (FR) performance
implications. We avoid limiting the deployment of our tools to certain FIQA
methods by basing our analyses on the behavior of FR models when processing
samples with different FIQA decisions. This leads to explainability tools that
can be applied for any FIQA method with any CNN-based FR solution using
activation mapping to exhibit the network's activation derived from the face
embedding. To avoid the low discrimination between the general spatial
activation mapping of low and high-quality images in FR models, we build our
explainability tools in a higher derivative space by analyzing the variation of
the FR activation maps of image sets with different quality decisions. We
demonstrate our tools and analyze the findings on four FIQA methods, by
presenting inter and intra-FIQA method analyses. Our proposed tools and the
analyses based on them point out, among other conclusions, that high-quality
images typically cause consistent low activation on the areas outside of the
central face region, while low-quality images, despite general low activation,
have high variations of activation in such areas. Our explainability tools also
extend to analyzing single images where we show that low-quality images tend to
have an FR model spatial activation that strongly differs from what is expected
from a high-quality image where this difference also tends to appear more in
areas outside of the central face region and does correspond to issues like
extreme poses and facial occlusions. The implementation of the proposed tools
is accessible here [link].

with measures of discrimination. This is a non-trivial problem as
discrimination measures are the most commonly used in survival analysis and yet
there is no clear method to derive a risk prediction from a distribution
prediction. We survey methods proposed in literature and software and consider
their respective advantages and disadvantages. Whilst distributions are
frequently evaluated by discrimination measures, we find that the method for
doing so is rarely described in the literature and often leads to unfair
comparisons. We find that the most robust method of reducing a distribution to
a risk is to sum over the predicted cumulative hazard. We recommend that
machine learning survival analysis software implements clear transformations
between distribution and risk predictions in order to allow more transparent

characteristics, apart from their ages (50~Myr and 9~Gyr). Each of the stars
hosts two sub-Neptune-like planets at similar orbits and in similar mass
ranges. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether the similarity of the host
stars and the configuration of the planetary systems can be taken as proof that
the two systems were formed and evolved in a similar way. In paper I of this
series, we performed a comparative study of these two systems using 3D modeling
of atmospheric escape and its interaction with the stellar wind, for the four
planets. We demonstrated that though the strong wind of the young star has a
crucial effect on observable signatures, its effect on the atmospheric mass
loss is minor in the evolutionary context. Here, we use atmosphere evolution
models to track the evolution of planets in the younger system TOI-942 and also
to constrain the past of the TOI-421 system. We demonstrate that despite all
the similarities, the two planetary systems are on two very different
evolutionary pathways. The inner planet in the younger system, TOI-942, will
likely lose all of its atmosphere and become a super-Earth-like planet, while
the outer planet will become a typical sub-Neptune. Concerning the older
system, TOI-421, our evolution modeling suggests that they must have started
their evolution with very substantial envelopes, which can be a hint of
formation beyond the snow line.

system architectures. An improved understanding of the formation process can be
achieved by studying it across the full parameter space, particularly toward
the extremes. Earlier studies of planets in close-in orbits around high-mass
stars have revealed an increase in giant planet frequency with increasing
stellar mass until a turnover point at 1.9 solar masses, above which the
frequency rapidly decreases. This could potentially imply that planet formation
is impeded around more massive stars, and that giant planets around stars
exceeding 3 solar masses may be rare or non-existent. However, the methods used
to detect planets in small orbits are insensitive to planets in wide orbits.
Here we demonstrate the existence of a planet at 560 times the Sun-Earth
distance from the 6-10 solar mass binary b Centauri through direct imaging. The
planet-to-star mass ratio of 0.10-0.17% is similar to the Jupiter-Sun ratio,
but the separation of the detected planet is ~100 times wider than that of
Jupiter. Our results show that planets can reside in much more massive stellar
systems than what would be expected from extrapolation of previous results. The
planet is unlikely to have formed in-situ through the conventional core
accretion mechanism, but might have formed elsewhere and arrived to its present
location through dynamical interactions, or might have formed via gravitational
instability.

the dark matter gets its mass via $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking, the phase
transition that gives a mass to the dark matter also produces cosmic strings
which radiate gravitational waves. Because the symmetry-breaking scale
$\Lambda_{CS}$ is of the same order as $M_{DM}$, the gravitational waves
radiated by the cosmic strings have a large enough amplitude to be detectable
across all frequencies accessible with current and planned experimental
facilities. Moreover, an epoch of early primordial black hole domination
introduces a unique spectral break in the gravitational wave spectrum whose
frequency is related to the super-heavy dark matter mass. Hence, the features
of a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves could indicate
that super-heavy dark matter originated from primordial black holes. In this
perspective, the recent finding of a stochastic common-spectrum process across
many pulsars by two nano-frequency pulsar timing arrays would fix the dark
matter mass to be $3\times 10^{13}~\text{GeV} \lesssim M_{DM} \lesssim

KD methods for object detection is non-trivial. In this work, we elaborately
study the behaviour difference between the teacher and student detection

rank their detected candidate boxes quite differently, which results in their
precision discrepancy. Second, there is a considerable gap between the feature
response differences and prediction differences between teacher and student,
indicating that equally imitating all the feature maps of the teacher is the
sub-optimal choice for improving the student's accuracy. Based on the two
observations, we propose Rank Mimicking (RM) and Prediction-guided Feature
Imitation (PFI) for distilling one-stage detectors, respectively. RM takes the
rank of candidate boxes from teachers as a new form of knowledge to distill,
which consistently outperforms the traditional soft label distillation. PFI
attempts to correlate feature differences with prediction differences, making
feature imitation directly help to improve the student's accuracy. On MS COCO

common yet challenging problem, has recently attracted considerable attention.
We observe that existing literature: 1) isolates the learning of attribute and
structure embedding thus fails to take full advantages of the two types of
information; 2) imposes too strict distribution assumption on the latent space
variables, leading to less discriminative feature representations. In this
paper, based on the idea of introducing intimate information interaction
between the two information sources, we propose our Siamese Attribute-missing
Graph Auto-encoder (SAGA). Specifically, three strategies have been conducted.
First, we entangle the attribute embedding and structure embedding by
introducing a siamese network structure to share the parameters learned by both
processes, which allows the network training to benefit from more abundant and
diverse information. Second, we introduce a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and
structural constraint enhanced learning mechanism to improve the quality of
latent features of the missing attributes by filtering unreliable connections.
Third, we manually mask the connections on multiple adjacent matrices and force
the structural information embedding sub-network to recover the true adjacent
matrix, thus enforcing the resulting network to be able to selectively exploit
more high-order discriminative features for data completion. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SAGA
against the state-of-the-art methods.

requiring methods that account for continuous and abrupt changes of sampling
resolution without introducing additional biases. The edit-distance is an
effective metric to quantitatively compare time series segments of unequal
length by computing the cost of transforming one segment into the other. We
show that transformation costs generally exhibit a non-trivial relationship
with local sampling rate. If the sampling resolution undergoes strong
variations, this effect impedes unbiased comparison between different time
episodes. We study the impact of this effect on recurrence quantification
analysis, a framework that is well-suited for identifying regime shifts in
nonlinear time series. A constrained randomization approach is put forward to
correct for the biased recurrence quantification measures. This strategy
involves the generation of a novel type of time series and time axis surrogates
which we call sampling rate constrained (SRC) surrogates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach with a synthetic example and an
irregularly sampled speleothem proxy record from Niue island in the central
tropical Pacific. Application of the proposed correction scheme identifies a
spurious transition that is solely imposed by an abrupt shift in sampling rate
and uncovers periods of reduced seasonal rainfall predictability associated

a unique shortest path. These paths are shown to determine the limiting
distribution of the properly rescaled random field given that a fixed variable
exceeds a high threshold. The latter limit relation implies that the random
field is multivariate regularly varying and it determines the max-stable
distribution to which component-wise maxima of independent random samples from
the field are attracted. When the sub-vectors induced by the blocks have
certain limits parametrized by H\""usler-Reiss distributions, the global Markov
property of the original field induces a particular structure on the parameter
matrix of the limiting max-stable H\""usler-Reiss distribution. The multivariate
Pareto version of the latter turns out to be an extremal graphical model
according to the original block graph. Thanks to these algebraic relations, the
parameters are still identifiable even if some variables are latent.

each $n$, a symmetry group of $w$ is a subgroup $G_n(w)$ of the symmetric group
$S_n$ such that $g(v)$ is a factor of $w$ for each permutation $g \in G_n(w)$

symmetry groups of Sturmian words and more generally Arnoux-Rauzy words are of
order two for large enough $n$; on the other hand, symmetry groups of certain

Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) conditions. We have also performed a non-LTE
analysis using SpectralRadex. We report the detection of a P-bearing molecule,
phosphorus nitride (PN), for the first time in an extragalactic environment,
towards two giant molecular clouds (GMCs) of NGC 253. The LTE analysis yields
total PN beam-averaged column densities $N$=(1.20$\pm$0.09)$\times$10$^{13}$

into abundances with respect to H$_2$ of $\chi$=(8.0$\pm$1.0)$\times$10$^{-12}$

temperature of $T_{\rm ex}$=(4.4$\pm$1.3) K towards the GMC with the brightest
PN emission, which indicates that PN is sub-thermally excited. The non-LTE
analysis results in column densities consistent with the LTE values. We have
also searched for other P-bearing molecules (PO, PH$_{3}$, CP and CCP), and
upper limits were derived. The derived PO/PN ratios are $<$1.3 and $<$1.7. The
abundance ratio between PN and the shock-tracer SiO derived towards NGC 253
follows the same trend previously found towards Galactic sources. Comparison of
the observations with chemical models indicates that the derived molecular
abundances of PN in NGC 253 can be explained by shock-driven chemistry followed

we consider the repeated preparation of an arbitrary state of a two-level

transformation, and thereafter use a perturbative approach to calculate the
decay rates for the system. Upon calculating the decay rates, we discover that
there is a transition in their qualitative behaviors as the state being
repeatedly prepared moves away from the excited state towards a superposition
of the ground and excited states. Our results should be useful for the quantum
control of a two-level system interacting with its environment.

optical and electronic response, multiferroic nature and lack of inversion
symmetry. The 2D SnS crystals exhibit anisotropic response along the in-plane
armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) crystallographic directions, offering an
additional degree of freedom in manipulating their behavior. Therefore,
calculating the AC/ZZ directions is important in characterizing the 2D SnS

the 2D SnS crystal, that produces second harmonic generation (SHG), to perform
polarization-resolved SHG (P-SHG) nonlinear imaging of the in-plane anisotropy.
We fit the P-SHG experimental data with a nonlinear optics model, that allows
us to calculate the AC/ZZ orientation from every point of the 2D crystal and to
map with high-resolution the AC/ZZ direction of several 2D SnS flakes belonging
in the same field of view. It is found that the P-SHG intensity polar patterns
are associated with the crystallographic axes of the flakes and with the
relative strength of the second order nonlinear susceptibility tensor in

this has occurred against a haphazard backdrop of proposals for solar export

passive participation will support customer trust in the guiderails of active

reveal an important discrepancy between the derived sample complexity and the
naive parameter counting, which serves as a direct indicator of the model

becomes so large that typical broadband photometric bands shift into the
neighboring rest frame band. At $z=0.6-0.8$ the shift reaches two or even three

explain due to its subjectivity, lack of context and deeply-felt opinion. In
the multimodal setup, sarcasm is conveyed through the incongruity between the
text and visual entities. Although recent approaches deal with sarcasm as a
classification problem, it is unclear why an online post is identified as
sarcastic. Without proper explanation, end users may not be able to perceive
the underlying sense of irony. In this paper, we propose a novel problem --
Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE) -- given a multimodal sarcastic post

explanation to reveal the intended sarcasm. To this end, we develop MORE, a new
dataset with explanation of 3510 sarcastic multimodal posts. Each explanation
is a natural language (English) sentence describing the hidden irony. We
benchmark MORE by employing a multimodal Transformer-based architecture. It
incorporates a cross-modal attention in the Transformer's encoder which attends
to the distinguishing features between the two modalities. Subsequently, a
BART-based auto-regressive decoder is used as the generator. Empirical results
demonstrate convincing results over various baselines (adopted for MuSE) across
five evaluation metrics. We also conduct human evaluation on predictions and
obtain Fleiss' Kappa score of 0.4 as a fair agreement among 25 evaluators.

(non) friendly links only. This topological transition was observed from the
domain distribution of each associated network between the two phases of the
system (absorbing and active). We also showed that another metric from network
science called modularity (or assortative coefficient) can also be used as
order parameter, giving the same phase diagram as the original order parameter

modularity for each associated network reaches a maximum value, while on the

confirmed its interaction with molecular clouds. About $0.36\degr$ north from
Kes 79, a powerful pulsar -- PSR J1853+0056 also deserves our attention. In
this work, we analyse the 11.5-year Fermi-LAT data to investigate the
$\gamma$-ray feature in/around this complex region. Our result shows a more
significant detection ($\sim$34.8$\sigma$ in 0.1--50 GeV) for this region. With
$\ge$5 GeV data, we detect two extended sources -- Src-N (the brighter one;
radius $\approx0.31\degr$) concentrated at the north of the SNR while enclosing
PSR J1853+0056, and Src-S (radius $\approx0.58\degr$) concentrated at the south
of the SNR. Their spectra have distinct peak energies ($\sim$1.0 GeV for Src-N
and $\lesssim$0.5 GeV for Src-S), suggesting different origins for them. In our
hadronic model that includes the leaked cosmic-rays (CRs) from the shock-cloud
collision, even with extreme values of parameters, SNR Kes 79 can by no means
provide enough CRs reaching clouds at Src-N to explain the local GeV spectrum.
We propose that the Src-N emission could be predominantly reproduced by a
putative pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR J1853+0056. On the other hand,
our same hadronic model can reproduce a majority of the GeV emission at Src-S
with typical values of parameters, while the three known pulsars inside Src-S
release a total power that is too low to account for half of its $\gamma$-ray
emission.

experiment in three flavour scenario as well as its sensitivity to non-standard
interactions (NSI) in neutrino propagation. Because of the largest possible
baseline length of 2595 km, P2O is expected to have strong sensitivity towards
neutrino mass hierarchy and NSI parameters. In our study, we show that even
though the number of appearance channel events for the minimal configuration of
P2O are higher compared to DUNE, still the hierarchy sensitivity of P2O is less
than DUNE because of large background events. Our results show that for a
background reduction factor of 0.46 and appearance channel background
systematic normalization error of $4\%$, the hierarchy sensitivity of P2O
becomes equivalent of DUNE for $\delta_{\rm CP} = 195^\circ$. We call this
configuration of P2O as optimized P2O. Regarding the study of NSI, we find
that, for $\epsilon_{e\mu}$ ($\epsilon_{e\tau}$) sensitivity of DUNE is similar
(better) as compared to optimized P2O when both $\epsilon_{e\mu}$ and
$\epsilon_{e\tau}$ are included in the analysis. Our results show that in
presence of NSI, the change of hierarchy sensitivity with respect to standard
three flavor scenario, is higher in P2O as compared to DUNE. Further, hierarchy
sensitivity in presence of NSI is lower (higher) than sensitivity in the
standard three flavour scenario for $\delta_{\rm CP} = 270^\circ (90^\circ)$.
It is important to note that hierarchy sensitivity of optimized P2O does not
get significantly better than DUNE for the current favourable values of
$\delta_{\rm CP}$ which is $180^\circ < \delta_{\rm CP} < 360^\circ$ as
obtained by the global analysis in both standard three flavour and in presence
of NSI.

modality that exploits the non-linear response of magnetic nanoparticles

capability to distinguish different MNPs and/or MNP environments. The system
function approach for color MPI relies on extensive calibrations that capture
the differences in the harmonic responses of the MNPs. An alternative
calibration-free x-space-based method called TAURUS estimates a map of the
relaxation time constant, by recovering the underlying mirror symmetry in the
MPI signal. However, TAURUS requires a back and forth scanning of a given
region, restricting its usage to slow trajectories with constant or piecewise
constant focus fields (FFs). In this work, we propose a novel technique to
increase the performance of TAURUS and enable $\tau$ map estimation for rapid
and multi-dimensional trajectories. The proposed technique is based on
correcting the mirror symmetry distortion induced by time-varying FFs. We
demonstrate via simulations and experiments in our in-house MPI scanner that
the proposed method successfully estimates high-fidelity time constant maps for
rapid trajectories that provide orders of magnitude reduction in scanning time
while preserving the calibration-free property of TAURUS.

solution to the many-body Schrodinger equation. The essential part of the DFT
theory is the exchange-correlation (XC) functional, which can not be obtained
in analytical form. Accordingly, the accuracy improvement of the DFT is mainly
based on the development of XC functional approximations. Commonly, they are
built upon analytic solutions in low- and high-density limits and result from
quantum Monte Carlo or post-Hartree-Fock numerical calculations. However, there
is no universal functional form to incorporate these data into XC functional.
Various parameterizations use heuristic rules to build a specific XC
functional. The neural network (NN) approach to interpolate the data from
higher precision theories can give a unified path to parametrize an XC
functional. Moreover, data from many existing quantum chemical databases could
provide the XC functional with improved accuracy. In this work, we develop NN
XC functional, which gives both exchange potential and exchange energy density.
Proposed NN architecture consists of two parts NN-E and NN-V, which could be
trained in separate ways, which adds additional flexibility. We also show the
suitability of the developed NN XC functional in the self-consistent cycle when
applied to atoms, molecules, and crystals.

track everything at once, or allocate their full capacity to a sparse

explore a middle ground based on the observation that the number of relevant

few-shot task adaptation, which allows a sparse-style network to condition on a
keypoint embedding that indicates which point to track. Our central finding is
that this approach provides the generality of dense-embedding models, while
offering accuracy significantly closer to sparse-keypoint approaches. We
present results illustrating this capacity vs. accuracy trade-off, and

Our analysis shows that, besides the tests and code, flakiness stems from

appear in the form of an inertial range energy spectrum $\mathcal{E}(k)\sim
k^{-q}$ and a cut-off wave-number $k_{c}$. For example, the values $q=5/3$ and
$\ell k_{c}\sim \mathit{Re}^{3/4}$ are intimately associated with Kolmogorov's
1941 theory. To extract such spectral information from the Navier-Stokes
equations, Doering and Gibbon (2002) introduced the idea of forming a set of
dynamic wave-numbers $\kappa_n(t)$ from ratios of norms of solutions. The time
averages of the $\kappa_n(t)$ can be interpreted as the 2$n$th-moments of the
energy spectrum. They found that $1 < q \leqslant 8/3$, thereby confirming the
earlier work of Sulem and Frisch (1975) who showed that when spatial
intermittency is included, no inertial range can exist in the limit of
vanishing viscosity unless $q \leqslant 8/3$. Since the $\kappa_n(t)$ are based
on Navier-Stokes weak solutions, this approach connects empirical predictions
of the energy spectrum with the mathematical analysis of the Navier-Stokes
equations. This method is developed to show how it can be applied to many
hydrodynamic models such as the two dimensional Navier--Stokes equations (in
both the direct- and inverse-cascade regimes), the forced Burgers equation and
shell models.

nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Even though star-forming activity can be
traced as close to about 3 kpc (in projection) distance to the GRB explosion
site, stellar population synthesis calculations show that none of the
Halpha-bright star-forming regions is a likely birthplace of the short-GRB

host galaxy clusters, assemble their mass over time alternating periods of
quiescent accretion and phases of rapid growth associated with major merger
episodes. Observations of such events in clusters can provide insights on the
astrophysical processes that characterise the properties of the intra-cluster
medium, as well as the gravitational processes that contribute to their
assembly. It is therefore of prime interest to devise a fast and reliable way
of detecting such perturbed systems. We present a novel approach to identifying
and timing major mergers in clusters characterised by large values of halo
sparsity. Using halo catalogues from the MultiDark-Planck2 simulation, we show
that major merger events disrupt the radial mass distribution of haloes, thus
leaving a distinct universal imprint on the evolution of halo sparsity over a
period not exceeding two dynamical times. We exploit this feature using
numerically calibrated distributions to test whether an observed galaxy cluster
with given sparsity measurements has undergone a recent major merger and to
eventually estimate when such an event occurred. We implement these statistical
tools in a specifically developed public python library \textsc{lammas}, which
we apply to the analysis of Abell 383 and Abell 2345 as test cases. Finding
that, for example, Abell 2345 had a major merger about $2.1\pm 0.2$ Gyr ago.
This work opens the way to detecting and timing major mergers in galaxy
clusters solely through measurements of their mass at different radii.

is one of the best targets to resolve the innermost region of SMBH with very
long baseline interferometry (VLBI). In this study, we have carried out
observations toward Sgr A* at 1.349 cm (22.223 GHz) and 6.950 mm (43.135 GHz)
with the East Asian VLBI Network, as a part of the multi-wavelength campaign of
the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) in 2017 April. To mitigate scattering
effects, the physically motivated scattering kernel model from Psaltis et al.
(2018) and the scattering parameters from Johnson et al. (2018) have been
applied. As a result, a single, symmetric Gaussian model well describes the
intrinsic structure of Sgr A* at both wavelengths. From closure amplitudes, the
major-axis sizes are ~704$\pm$102 $\mu$as (axial ratio
$\sim$1.19$^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$) and $\sim$300$\pm$25 $\mu$as (axial ratio
$\sim$1.28$\pm$0.2) at 1.349 cm and 6.95 mm respectively. Together with a
quasi-simultaneous observation at 3.5 mm (86 GHz) by Issaoun et al. (2019), we
show that the intrinsic size scales with observing wavelength as a power-law,
with an index $\sim$1.2$\pm$0.2. Our results also provide estimates of the size
and compact flux density at 1.3 mm, which can be incorporated into the analysis
of the EHT observations. In terms of the origin of radio emission, we have
compared the intrinsic structures with the accretion flow scenario, especially
the radiatively inefficient accretion flow based on the Keplerian shell model.
With this, we show that a nonthermal electron population is necessary to
reproduce the source sizes.

potentially erroneous assignment of modal characters to the spectral features.
We develop an intuitive analogy that helps distinguish between the two

infer about the change in the turbine's health. Analyzes are carried out
separately for different external conditions (wind speed and temperature). We
extract concepts that represent relative low, moderate, and high power
production. The first method aims at evaluating the decrease or increase in
relatively high and low power production. This task is performed using a
regression-like model. The second method evaluates the overall drift of the
extracted concepts. Large drift indicates that the power production process
undergoes fluctuations in time. Concepts are labeled using linguistic labels,

integrals in a regime of low regularity where the usual Riemann-Stieltjes
integral does not converge. Before we may rigorously define rough paths, we
start with the introduction of some basic algebraic terminology. Among them are
algebras and coalgebras, two notions which are in some sense dual to each
other. As a combination of these notions we obtain bialgebras, and as a special
case of them then Hopf algebras, which play a central role in this thesis.
After further algebraic preliminaries, we give the examples of Hopf algebras we
are interested in. Among them is the example of the polynomial Hopf algebra,
whose product is nothing but the usual multiplication of polynomials and whose
coproduct can be expressed very simply with the help of a binomial coefficient.
We then use the dual pair of tensor Hopf algebras to introduce weakly geometric
rough paths, which correspond to notions of Stieltjes integrals satisfying the
usual integration by parts rule. For cases like It\^o-integration where we need
to give up integration by parts, we look at Gubinelli's branched rough paths
based on the dual pair of Hopf algebras on trees and forests. Finally, we give
some basic concepts of Hairer's theory of regularity structures and use them
for a different approach to branched and weakly geometric rough paths. While we
first look at a general method described by Hairer to derive a regularity
structure from certain Hopf algebras, we then develop a regularity structure
based on a formal Picard iteration which is more suitable for dealing with
rough differential equations.

end-to-end networks mapping the noisy mixture into an estimate of the clean

microphone recordings, prior works have aimed to incorporate spatial statistics
along with spectral information to boost up performance. Despite an improvement
in enhancement performance of mono output, the spatial image preservation and
subjective evaluations have not gained much attention in the literature. This
paper proposes a novel stereo-aware framework for speech enhancement, i.e., a
training loss for deep learning-based speech enhancement to preserve the
spatial image while enhancing the stereo mixture. The proposed framework is
model independent, hence it can be applied to any deep learning based
architecture. We provide an extensive objective and subjective evaluation of
the trained models through a listening test. We show that by regularizing for

  Extraction","WSDM2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Tagging based relational triple extraction methods are attracting growing
research attention recently. However, most of these methods take a
unidirectional extraction framework that first extracts all subjects and then
extracts objects and relations simultaneously based on the subjects extracted.
This framework has an obvious deficiency that it is too sensitive to the
extraction results of subjects. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a
bidirectional extraction framework based method that extracts triples based on
the entity pairs extracted from two complementary directions. Concretely, we
first extract all possible subject-object pairs from two paralleled directions.
These two extraction directions are connected by a shared encoder component,
thus the extraction features from one direction can flow to another direction
and vice versa. By this way, the extractions of two directions can boost and
complement each other. Next, we assign all possible relations for each entity
pair by a biaffine model. During training, we observe that the share structure
will lead to a convergence rate inconsistency issue which is harmful to
performance. So we propose a share-aware learning mechanism to address it. We
evaluate the proposed model on multiple benchmark datasets. Extensive
experimental results show that the proposed model is very effective and it
achieves state-of-the-art results on all of these datasets. Moreover,
experiments show that both the proposed bidirectional extraction framework and
the share-aware learning mechanism have good adaptability and can be used to
improve the performance of other tagging based methods. The source code of our
work is available at: https://github.com/neukg/BiRTE.

representing tractable probability distributions over combinatorial spaces. In
machine learning and probabilistic programming, one is often interested in
understanding whether the distributions learned using PCs are close to the
desired distribution. Thus, given two probabilistic circuits, a fundamental
problem of interest is to determine whether their distributions are close to
each other.
  The primary contribution of this paper is a closeness test for PCs with
respect to the total variation distance metric. Our algorithm utilizes two
common PC queries, counting and sampling. In particular, we provide a poly-time
probabilistic algorithm to check the closeness of two PCs when the PCs support
tractable approximate counting and sampling. We demonstrate the practical
efficiency of our algorithmic framework via a detailed experimental evaluation
of a prototype implementation against a set of 475 PC benchmarks. We find that
our test correctly decides the closeness of all 475 PCs within 3600 seconds.

high fidelity quantum control of atomic qubits. The ultimate fidelity floor for
atomic qubits driven with laser radiation is due to spontaneous emission from
excited energy levels. The goal is to suppress the technical noise from the
laser source to below the spontaneous emission floor such that it is no longer
a limiting factor. It has been shown that the spectral structure of control
noise can have a large influence on achievable control fidelities, while prior
studies of laser noise contributions have been restricted to noise magnitudes.
Here, we study the unique spectral structure of laser noise and introduce a new
metric that determines when a stabilised laser source has been optimised for
quantum control of atomic qubits. We find requirements on stabilisation
bandwidths that can be orders of magnitude higher than those required to simply
narrow the linewidth of a laser. We introduce a new metric, the
$\chi$-separation line, that provides a tool for the study and engineering of
laser sources for quantum control of atomic qubits below the spontaneous

Recent advances in representation learning and perceptual learning inspired us
to consider the reconstruction of media inputs from side channel traces as a
cross-modality manifold learning task that can be addressed in a unified manner
with an autoencoder framework trained to learn the mapping between media inputs
and side channel observations. We further enhance the autoencoder with
attention to localize the program points that make the primary contribution to
SCA, thus automatically pinpointing information-leakage points in media
software. We also propose a novel and highly effective defensive technique
called perception blinding that can perturb media inputs with perception masks
and mitigate manifold learning-based SCA.
  Our evaluation exploits three popular media software to reconstruct inputs in
image, audio, and text formats. We analyze three common side channels - cache
bank, cache line, and page tables - and userspace-only cache set accesses
logged by standard Prime+Probe. Our framework successfully reconstructs
high-quality confidential inputs from the assessed media software and
automatically pinpoint their vulnerable program points, many of which are

because of the existence of adversarial attacks. Such attacks usually rely on
the principle of transferability, where an adversarial example crafted on a
surrogate classifier tends to mislead the target classifier trained on the same
dataset even if both classifiers have quite different architecture. Ensemble
methods against adversarial attacks demonstrate that an adversarial example is
less likely to mislead multiple classifiers in an ensemble having diverse
decision boundaries. However, recent ensemble methods have either been shown to
be vulnerable to stronger adversaries or shown to lack an end-to-end
evaluation. This paper attempts to develop a new ensemble methodology that
constructs multiple diverse classifiers using a Pairwise Adversarially Robust
Loss (PARL) function during the training procedure. PARL utilizes gradients of
each layer with respect to input in every classifier within the ensemble
simultaneously. The proposed training procedure enables PARL to achieve higher
robustness against black-box transfer attacks compared to previous ensemble
methods without adversely affecting the accuracy of clean examples. We also
evaluate the robustness in the presence of white-box attacks, where adversarial
examples are crafted using parameters of the target classifier. We present
extensive experiments using standard image classification datasets like
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 trained using standard ResNet20 classifier against
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks to demonstrate the robustness of the

develop a mean-field description of the stochastic network model and study the

additional connections it generates. In contrast, considering also random walks
of fractional order that in some sense are a more realistic model of human
mobility, we find that these non-local transport dynamics raise the epidemic
threshold in comparison to a classical local random walk. We also test our
model on a realistic transport network (the Munich U-Bahn network), and

formalism where the full light-matter interaction leads to induced
inter-emitter interactions described by the classical Green function of
inhomogeneous dielectric media. When making the RWA in the light-matter
interaction, however, these induced interactions differ from the classical
Green function, and for free space we find a reduction of the interatomic
interaction strength by up to a factor of two. By contrast, for the
corresponding scalar model the relative RWA error for the inter-emitter
interaction even diverges in the near field. For two identical emitters, the
errors due to the RWA in collective light emission will show up in the emission
spectrum, but not in the sub- and superradiant decay rates. In case of two
non-identical emitters, also the collective emission rates will differ by
making the RWA. For three or more identical emitters, the RWA errors in the
interatomic interaction in general affect both the collective emission spectra
and the collective decay rates. Ring configurations with discrete rotational
symmetry are an interesting exception. Interestingly, the maximal errors in the

an estimate for solar irradiance. This estimate is then post-processed using ML
to provide a final prediction. Normalized root-mean-square error from WRF is
reduced by up to 40-50% with this ML error correction model. Results obtained
using CAM, GFDL, New Goddard and RRTMG radiation models were comparable after
this correction, negating the need for WRF parameterization tuning. Other
models incorporating nearby locations and sensor data are also evaluated, with

diagnostic technique is based on measuring the change in phase and power of a
microwave beam passing tangentially through the edge plasma. The wave
propagation involves varying combinations of refraction, phase change and
further interference of the beam fractions. A 3D model is constructed as a
synthetic diagnostic for MILS and allows exploring this broad range of wave
propagation regimes. The diagnostic parameters, such as its dimensions,
frequency and configuration of the emitter and receiver antennas, should be
balanced to meet the target range and location of measurements. It can be
therefore adjusted for various conditions and here the diagnostic concept is
evaluated on a chosen example, which was taken as suitable to cover densities
of ~10^15-10^19 m^-3 on the edge of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. Based on a
density profile with fixed radial shape, appropriate for experimental density
approximation, a database of syntethic diagnostic measurements is built. The
developed genetic algorithm genMILS of density profile reconstruction using the
constructed database results in quite low numerical error. It is estimated as ~
5-15 % for density >10^17 m^-3. Therefore, the new diagnostic technique (with
dedicated data processing algorithm) has a large potential in practical
applications in a wide range of densities, with low numerical error, so the
total error and the density estimation accuracy is expected to be defined by
experimental uncertainties.

self-supervised and semi-supervised methods extract either task-unrelated or
task-specific training signals from unlabeled data. We show that these two
approaches, at the two extreme ends of the task-specificity spectrum, are
suboptimal for the task performance. Utilizing too little task-specific
training signals causes underfitting to the ground-truth labels of downstream
tasks, while the opposite causes overfitting to the ground-truth labels. To
this end, we propose a novel Class-Agnostic Semi-Supervised Learning (CA-SSL)
framework to achieve a more favorable task-specificity balance in extracting
training signals from unlabeled data. CA-SSL has three training stages that act
on either ground-truth labels (labeled data) or pseudo labels (unlabeled data).
This decoupling strategy avoids the complicated scheme in traditional SSL
methods that balances the contributions from both data types. Especially, we
introduce a warmup training stage to achieve a more optimal balance in task
specificity by ignoring class information in the pseudo labels, while
preserving localization training signals. As a result, our warmup model can
better avoid underfitting/overfitting when fine-tuned on the ground-truth
labels in detection and segmentation tasks. Using 3.6M unlabeled data, we
achieve a significant performance gain of 4.7% over ImageNet-pretrained
baseline on FCOS object detection. In addition, our warmup model demonstrates
excellent transferability to other detection and segmentation frameworks.

proposed for the realization of artificial magnonic crystals and new spintronic

importance to analyze their dynamical properties in the GHz range, i.e. in the

then the case of two interacting skyrmions and finally a linear chain,

series which aims to address this question in the context of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$
mirror symmetry. A general prescription for constructing vortex defects and
their mirror maps in quiver gauge theories beyond the $A$-type was presented by
the author in an earlier paper [arxiv:2103.01243], where specific examples
involving $D$-type and affine $D$-type quivers were discussed. In this paper,
we apply the aforementioned prescription to construct a family of vortex
defects as coupled 3d-1d systems in quiver gauge theories beyond the
$ADE$-type, and study their mirror maps. Specifically, we focus on a class of
quiver gauge theories involving unitary gauge nodes with edge multiplicity
greater than 1, i.e. two gauge nodes in these theories may be connected by
multiple bifundamental hypermultiplets. Quiver gauge theories of this type
arise as 3d mirrors of certain Argyres-Douglas theories compactified on a
circle. Some of these quiver gauge theories are known to have a pair of 3d
mirrors, which are themselves related by an IR duality, discussed recently in
[arxiv:2109.07493]. For a concrete example where a pair of 3d mirrors do exist,
we study how the vortex defects constructed using our prescription map to
Wilson defects in each mirror theory.

us to specify the internal structure and chemical elements of Jupiter and
Saturn, respectively. However, we still do not know much about the impact of
rotation on the planetary internal structure as well as their formation. The
centrifugal force induced by rotation deforms the planetary shape and partially
counteracts the gravitational force. Thus, rotation will affect the critical
core mass of the exoplanet. Once the atmospheric mass becomes comparable to the
critical core mass, the planet will enter the runaway accretion phase and
becomes a gas giant. We have confirmed that the critical core masses of
rotating planets depend on the stiffness of the polytrope, the outer boundary
conditions, and the thickness of the isothermal layer. The critical core mass
with Bondi boundary condition is determined by the surface properties. The
critical core mass of a rotating planet will increase with the core gravity
(i.e., the innermost density). For the Hill boundary condition, the soft
polytrope shares the same properties as planets with Bondi boundary condition.
Since the total mass for planets with Hill boundary condition increases with
the decrease of the polytropic index, higher core gravity is required for
rotating planets. As a result, the critical core mass in the stiff Hill model
sharply increases. The rotation effects become more important when the
radiative and convective regions coexist. Besides, the critical core mass of
planets with Hill (Bondi) boundary increases noticeably as the radiative layer
becomes thinner (thicker).

quartets due to the collision of bands of continuous spectrum. The relevant
instabilities become weaker as the lattice size gets larger. Finally, we also
consider multi-soliton analogues of these Floquet states, inspired by the

of the sterile neutrino searches at a commercial nuclear reactor. Due to its
highly advantageous location, fine segmentation and ability to change the
distance to the neutrino production origin DANSS is ahead of many similar
experiments around the world in terms of the counting rate, signal to
background ratio and sterile neutrino exclusion regions. Yet a moderate energy
resolution of the detector prevents the further progress in the physics
program. The main challenge of the planned upgrade is to achieve the energy
resolution of 12% at 1 MeV. The new design of the main sensitive element - the
plastic scintillation strip - is the most important step forward. The strip
prototypes were manufactured and tested at the pion beam of the PNPI

detector response uniformity, longitudinal timing information and other

the drawbacks of the current strip version, outlines the new features of the

methods, our AdaStereo realizes a more standard, complete and effective domain
adaptation pipeline. Firstly, we propose a non-adversarial progressive color
transfer algorithm for input image-level alignment. Secondly, we design an
efficient parameter-free cost normalization layer for internal feature-level
alignment. Lastly, a highly related auxiliary task, self-supervised
occlusion-aware reconstruction is presented to narrow the gaps in output space.
We perform intensive ablation studies and break-down comparisons to validate
the effectiveness of each proposed module. With no extra inference overhead and
only a slight increase in training complexity, our AdaStereo models achieve
state-of-the-art cross-domain performance on multiple benchmarks, including
KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D and DrivingStereo, even outperforming some
state-of-the-art disparity networks finetuned with target-domain ground-truths.
Moreover, based on two additional evaluation metrics, the superiority of our
domain-adaptive stereo matching pipeline is further uncovered from more
perspectives. Finally, we demonstrate that our method is robust to various
domain adaptation settings, and can be easily integrated into quick adaptation
application scenarios and real-world deployments.

dichalcogenide layers via their environment as a route to new
functionalization. However, it remains a challenge to induce large electronic
changes without chemically altering the layer or compromising its
two-dimensionality. Here, a non-invasive technique is used to shift the
chemical potential of monolayer MoS$_2$ through p- and n-type doping of
graphene (Gr), which remains a well-decoupled 2D substrate. With the
intercalation of oxygen (O) under Gr, a nearly rigid Fermi level shift of 0.45
eV in MoS$_2$ is demonstrated, whereas the intercalation of europium (Eu)
induces a metal-insulator transition in MoS$_2$, accompanied by a giant band
gap reduction of 0.67 eV. Additionally, the effect of the substrate charge on
1D states within MoS$_2$ mirror-twin boundaries (MTBs) is explored. It is found
that the 1D nature of the MTB states is not compromised, even when MoS$_2$ is
made metallic. Furthermore, with the periodicity of the 1D states dependent on
substrate-induced charging and depletion, the boundaries serve as chemical
potential sensors functional up to room temperature.

radiologists are increasingly stressed to examine the CT scans manually.
Therefore, an automated 3D CT scan recognition tool is highly in demand since
the manual analysis is time-consuming for radiologists and their fatigue can
cause possible misjudgment. However, due to various technical specifications of
CT scanners located in different hospitals, the appearance of CT images can be
significantly different leading to the failure of many automated image

extensive number of exponentially-localized states, dubbed non-Hermitian skin

However, the selective excitation of the system in one among the

Here we suggest a route toward the selective and tunable excitation of

semi-infinite lattice boundaries via tailored on-site potentials at the edges

negligible for most of the loops considered in the study. For loops with high

the effect of heating-cooling misbalance with a temperature- and

polytropic index [$\gamma_{\rm eff}$] and found that under linear MHD the
effect of compressive viscosity on polytropic index is negligible. The
radiative losses with constant heating lead to a monotonic increase of
$\gamma_{\rm eff}$ with increasing density whereas the consideration of an
assumed heating function [$H(\rho,T) \propto \rho^{a}T^{b}$, where $a=-0.5$ and

due to limitations on cost, acquisition time, or dosage. However, traditional
direct reconstruction methods such as filtered back-projection (FBP) lead to
low-quality reconstructions in the sub-Nyquist regime. In contrast, deep neural
networks (DNNs) can produce high-quality reconstructions from sparse and noisy
data, e.g. through post-processing of FBP reconstructions, as can model-based
iterative reconstruction (MBIR), albeit at a higher computational cost.
  In this paper, we introduce a direct-reconstruction DNN method called
Recurrent Stacked Back Projection (RSBP) that uses sequentially-acquired
backprojections of individual views as input to a recurrent convolutional LSTM
network. The SBP structure maintains all information in the sinogram, while the
recurrent processing exploits the correlations between adjacent views and
produces an updated reconstruction after each new view. We train our network on
simulated data and test on both simulated and real data and demonstrate that
RSBP outperforms both DNN post-processing of FBP images and basic MBIR, with a
lower computational cost than MBIR.

vector projection distance and abstract triangular Conditional Random Field
(CRF) for the few-shot NLU. The vector projection distance exploits projections
of contextual word embeddings on label vectors as word-label similarities,
which is equivalent to a normalized linear model. The abstract triangular CRF
learns domain-agnostic label transitions for joint intent classification and
slot filling tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods
can significantly surpass strong baselines. Specifically, our approach can

Bayesian neural networks (BNN), Monte Carlo dropout (MCDropout) -- aim to
improve the interpretability of machine learning models by assigning an
estimated uncertainty value to each of their prediction outputs. However, since
too high uncertainty estimates can have fatal consequences in practice, this
paper analyzes the above techniques.
  Firstly, we show that GP methods always yield high uncertainty estimates on
out of distribution (OOD) data. Secondly, we show on a 2D toy example that both
BNNs and MCDropout do not give high uncertainty estimates on OOD samples.
Finally, we show empirically that this pitfall of BNNs and MCDropout holds on
real world datasets as well. Our insights (i) raise awareness for the more
cautious use of currently popular UE methods in Deep Learning, (ii) encourage
the development of UE methods that approximate GP-based methods -- instead of

in the field of computer vision. However, most existing methods fail to perform
good boundary extraction for prediction maps and cannot fully use high level

thermal modalities but are unable to obtain comprehensive fused features. To
address these problems, we propose an edge-aware guidance fusion network
(EGFNet) for RGB thermal scene parsing. First, we introduce a prior edge map
generated using the RGB and thermal images to capture detailed information in

multimodal fusion module that guarantees adequate cross-modal fusion.
Considering the importance of high level semantic information, we propose a
global information module and a semantic information module to extract rich
semantic information from the high-level features. For decoding, we use simple
elementwise addition for cascaded feature fusion. Finally, to improve the

its application to inverse problems have demonstrated state-of-the-art

are inherently slow to sample from, needing few thousand steps of iteration to
generate images from pure Gaussian noise. In this work, we show that starting
from Gaussian noise is unnecessary. Instead, starting from a single forward
diffusion with better initialization significantly reduces the number of
sampling steps in the reverse conditional diffusion. This phenomenon is
formally explained by the contraction theory of the stochastic difference
equations like our conditional diffusion strategy - the alternating
applications of reverse diffusion followed by a non-expansive data consistency
step. The new sampling strategy, dubbed Come-Closer-Diffuse-Faster (CCDF), also
reveals a new insight on how the existing feed-forward neural network
approaches for inverse problems can be synergistically combined with the

A typical framework is to simultaneously estimate the illumination and

encapsulated in feature spaces, causing many unfavorable outcomes, e.g.,
details loss, color unsaturation, artifacts, and so on. To address these
issues, we develop a new context-sensitive decomposition network architecture
to exploit the scene-level contextual dependencies on spatial scales. More
concretely, we build a two-stream estimation mechanism including reflectance
and illumination estimation network. We design a novel context-sensitive
decomposition connection to bridge the two-stream mechanism by incorporating
the physical principle. The spatially-varying illumination guidance is further
constructed for achieving the edge-aware smoothness property of the
illumination component. According to different training patterns, we construct
CSDNet (paired supervision) and CSDGAN (unpaired supervision) to fully evaluate
our designed architecture. We test our method on seven testing benchmarks to
conduct plenty of analytical and evaluated experiments. Thanks to our designed
context-sensitive decomposition connection, we successfully realized excellent
enhanced results, which fully indicates our superiority against existing

high-efficiency, we develop a lightweight CSDNet (named LiteCSDNet) by reducing
the number of channels. Further, by sharing an encoder for these two

an optimal solution for a twice-differentiable function. It is found that the
learning rate has to be sufficiently small to ensure local stability of the
optimal solution. The above convergence results also hold for AdamW. In this
work, we propose a new adaptive optimisation method by extending AdamW in two
aspects with the purpose to relax the requirement on small learning rate for
local stability, which we refer to as Aida. Firstly, we consider tracking the
2nd moment r_t of the pth power of the gradient-magnitudes. r_t reduces to v_t
of AdamW when p=2. Suppose {m_t} is the first moment of AdamW. It is known that
the update direction m_{t+1}/(v_{t+1}+epsilon)^0.5 (or
m_{t+1}/(v_{t+1}^0.5+epsilon) of AdamW (or Adam) can be decomposed as the sign
vector sign(m_{t+1}) multiplied elementwise by a vector of magnitudes
|m_{t+1}|/(v_{t+1}+epsilon)^0.5 (or |m_{t+1}|/(v_{t+1}^0.5+epsilon)). Aida is
designed to compute the qth power of the magnitude in the form of
|m_{t+1}|^q/(r_{t+1}+epsilon)^(q/p) (or |m_{t+1}|^q/((r_{t+1})^(q/p)+epsilon)),
which reduces to that of AdamW when (p,q)=(2,1).
  Suppose the origin 0 is a local optimal solution of a twice-differentiable
function. It is found theoretically that when q>1 and p>1 in Aida, the origin 0
is locally stable only when the weight-decay is non-zero. Experiments are
conducted for solving ten toy optimisation problems and training Transformer
and Swin-Transformer for two deep learning (DL) tasks. The empirical study
demonstrates that in a number of scenarios (including the two DL tasks), Aida
with particular setups of (p,q) not equal to (2,1) outperforms the setup
(p,q)=(2,1) of AdamW.

one hand, the trained prediction model can only capture the motion pattern in

Value decomposition, which decomposes joint action values into individual
action values, has been an important work in MAS. However, many value
decomposition methods ignore the coordination among different agents, leading
to the notorious ""lazy agents"" problem. To enhance the coordination in MAS,
this paper proposes HyperGraph CoNvolution MIX (HGCN-MIX), a method that
incorporates hypergraph convolution with value decomposition. HGCN-MIX models
agents as well as their relationships as a hypergraph, where agents are nodes
and hyperedges among nodes indicate that the corresponding agents can
coordinate to achieve larger rewards. Then, it trains a hypergraph that can
capture the collaborative relationships among agents. Leveraging the learned
hypergraph to consider how other agents' observations and actions affect their
decisions, the agents in a MAS can better coordinate. We evaluate HGCN-MIX in
the StarCraft II multi-agent challenge benchmark. The experimental results
demonstrate that HGCN-MIX can train joint policies that outperform or achieve a
similar level of performance as the current state-of-the-art techniques. We
also observe that HGCN-MIX has an even more significant improvement of
performance in the scenarios with a large amount of agents. Besides, we conduct
additional analysis to emphasize that when the hypergraph learns more
relationships, HGCN-MIX can train stronger joint policies.

  Spiking Neural Networks","It is an older version of arXiv:2112.08954 and was submitted by
  mistake",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Despite the rapid progress of neuromorphic computing, the inadequate depth
and the resulting insufficient representation power of spiking neural networks
(SNNs) severely restrict their application scope in practice. Residual learning
and shortcuts have been evidenced as an important approach for training deep
neural networks, but rarely did previous work assess their applicability to the
characteristics of spike-based communication and spatiotemporal dynamics. This
negligence leads to impeded information flow and the accompanying degradation
problem. In this paper, we identify the crux and then propose a novel residual
block for SNNs, which is able to significantly extend the depth of directly
trained SNNs, e.g., up to 482 layers on CIFAR-10 and 104 layers on ImageNet,
without observing any slight degradation problem. We validate the effectiveness
of our methods on both frame-based and neuromorphic datasets, and our
SRM-ResNet104 achieves a superior result of 76.02% accuracy on ImageNet, the
first time in the domain of directly trained SNNs. The great energy efficiency
is estimated and the resulting networks need on average only one spike per
neuron for classifying an input sample. We believe our powerful and scalable
modeling will provide a strong support for further exploration of SNNs.

option prices through deep self-consistent learning, by approximating market
option prices and local volatility using deep neural networks. Our method uses
the initial-boundary value problem of the underlying Dupire's partial
differential equation solved by the parameterized option prices to bring
corrections to the parameterization in a self-consistent way. By exploiting the
differentiability of the neural networks, we can evaluate Dupire's equation
locally at each maturity-strike pair; while by exploiting their continuity, we
sample maturity-strike pairs uniformly from a given domain, going beyond the
discrete points where the options are quoted. For comparison with existing
approaches, the proposed method is tested on both synthetic and market option
prices, which shows an improved performance in terms of repricing error, no
violation of the no-arbitrage constraints, and smoothness of the calibrated
local volatility.

over-provisioning, but there is no simple measure of just how much
over-provisioning can buy. In this Thesis, we aim to provide the network
designer with a simple view of the network robustness to traffic matrix
changes. We first present the Traffic Load Distribution Plots, or T-Plots, a
class of plots illustrating the percentage of traffic matrices that can be
serviced as a function of the capacity over-provisioning. For instance, from a
simple look at their T- Plots, network designers can guarantee that their
network services all admissible traffic matrices, or 99% of permutation traffic
matrices, or all traffic matrices with ingress/egress load at most half the
maximum. We further show that, unfortunately, in the general case plotting
T-Plots is #P-Complete, i.e., that it is impossible to plot a T-plot in a
polynomial time by the noon tools. However, we show that T-Plots can sometimes
be closely modeled as Gaussian, thus only using two values (mean and variance)
to quantify the robustness of a capacity allocation to traffic matrix changes.
We further utilize these Gaussian T-Plots to provide a more robust capacity
allocation. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of using T-Plots by showing
results of extensive Monte Carlo simulations in a real backbone network. This
Thesis was submitted in 2007. Since then, the results that appeared in it were
applied in various networking environments. In this newer version, we revisit
the results 13 years later and explain their relevance to state-of-the-art
problems in network design.
