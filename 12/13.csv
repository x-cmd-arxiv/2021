DiVA uniquely offers support for simultaneous comparison of two competing
diffusion models and even the comparison with the ground-truth results, both of
which help develop a coherent understanding of real-world scenarios. Along with
performing an exhaustive feature comparison and system evaluation of DiVA

the pure $R^2$ model, regardless the values of the free parameters. Basically
the deformed $R^2$ model is also a single parameter inflationary model, exactly
like the ordinary $R^2$ model. In contrast to the early-time era, where the
deformed $R^2$ model is quite similar to the $R^2$ model, at late times, the
phenomenological picture is different. The deformed $R^2$ model describes
stronger gravity compared to the ordinary $R^2$ with an effectively smaller
effective Planck mass. We propose the addition of an early dark energy term
which does not affect at all the inflationary era, but takes over the control
of the late-time dynamics at late times. We study in some detail the predicted

deformed $R^2$ model can describe a viable dark energy era, compatible with the
Planck constraints on cosmological parameters. Furthermore the model is

A persistent X-ray period at ~ 546 s confirming the optical spin period
obtained from previous observations is detected. The detection of a strong
X-ray spin pulse reinforces the classification of this system as an
intermediate polar. The lack of orbital or side-band periodicities in the
X-rays implies that the system is accreting predominantly via a disk. A
variable covering absorber appears to be responsible for the spin pulsations in
the low energy range. In the high energy band, the pulsations are likely due to
the self occultation of tall shocks above the white dwarf surface. The observed
double-humped X-ray spin pulse profile indicates two-pole accretion geometry
with tall accretion regions in short rotating IP IGR J16547-1916. We present
the variation of the spin pulse profile over an orbital phase to account for
the effects of orbital motion on the spin pulsation. X-ray spectra obtained
from the contemporaneous observations of Swift and NuSTAR in the 0.5-78.0 keV
energy band are modeled with a maximum temperature of 31 keV and a blackbody
temperature of 64 eV, along with a common column density of $1.8\times10^{23}

additional Gaussian component and a reflection component are needed to account

arise from the combination of electron-electron repulsion at high energies and

works, superconductivity can develop despite the overall repulsion due to the
energy dependence of the interaction, but the gap $\Delta(\omega)$ must change
sign at some (imaginary) frequency $\omega_0$ to counteract the repulsion.
However, when the constant repulsive part of the interaction is increased, a
quantum phase transition towards the normal state occurs. We show that, as the

correlated way such that $1/|\log[\Delta(0)]| \sim \omega_0^2$. We discuss the

'U-shape' at intermediate stellar masses from 0.1<z<0.7 for a number of
metrics, including using the deconvolved intrinsic dispersion. A physical
interpretation of this relation is the combination of stochastic star-formation
and stellar feedback causing large scatter at low stellar masses and AGN
feedback causing asymmetric scatter at high stellar masses. As such, the shape
of this distribution and its evolution encodes detailed information about the
astrophysical processes affecting star-formation, feedback and the lifecycle of
galaxies. We find that the stellar mass that the minimum ${\sigma}_{SFR}$
occurs evolves linearly with redshift, moving to higher stellar masses with
increasing lookback time and traces the turnover in the star-forming sequence.
This minimum ${\sigma}_{SFR}$ point is also found to occur at a fixed specific
star-formation rate (sSFR) at all epochs (sSFR~10$^{-9.6}$yr$^{-1}$). The
physical interpretation of this is that there exists a maximum sSFR at which
galaxies can internally self-regulate on the tight sequence of star-formation.
At higher sSFRs, stochastic stellar processes begin to cause galaxies to be
pushed both above and below the star-forming sequence leading to increased SFR
dispersion. As the Universe evolves, a higher fraction of galaxies will drop
below this sSFR threshold, causing the dispersion of the low-stellar mass end
of the star-forming sequence to decrease with time.

discover that the first layer of a deep network possesses multiple disparate
optima when solely retrained. This indicates a large posterior variance when
the first layer is altered by a Bayesian layer, which motivates us to design a
spatial-temporal-fusion BNN (STF-BNN) for efficiently scaling BNNs to large

training; and (2) the first layer is converted to Bayesian and inferred by
employing stochastic variational inference, while other layers are fixed.
Compared to vanilla BNNs, our approach can greatly reduce the training time and
the number of parameters, which contributes to scale BNNs efficiently. We
further provide theoretical guarantees on the generalizability and the

strategically modify their observable features in ways they believe will
maximize their chances of receiving a favorable decision. In many practical
situations, the underlying assessment rule is deliberately kept secret to avoid
gaming and maintain competitive advantage. The resulting opacity forces the
decision subjects to rely on incomplete information when making strategic
feature modifications. We capture such settings as a game of Bayesian
persuasion, in which the decision maker offers a form of recourse to the
decision subject by providing them with an action recommendation (or signal) to
incentivize them to modify their features in desirable ways. We show that when
using persuasion, the decision maker and decision subject are never worse off
in expectation, while the decision maker can be significantly better off. While
the decision maker's problem of finding the optimal Bayesian
incentive-compatible (BIC) signaling policy takes the form of optimization over
infinitely-many variables, we show that this optimization can be cast as a
linear program over finitely-many regions of the space of possible assessment
rules. While this reformulation simplifies the problem dramatically, solving
the linear program requires reasoning about exponentially-many variables, even
in relatively simple cases. Motivated by this observation, we provide a
polynomial-time approximation scheme that recovers a near-optimal signaling
policy. Finally, our numerical simulations on semi-synthetic data empirically
demonstrate the benefits of using persuasion in the algorithmic recourse
setting.

throughout the kinetic non-linear advection channel. We also show that this
negligible mean flux is the result of a flux-loop balance between heterochiral
(direct) and homochiral (inverse) transfers. Conversely, both homochiral and
heterochiral channels transfer energy forward for the other three channels.
Cross exchange between velocity and the magnetic field is reversed around $a =
0.4$ and except when $a \sim 1$ we always observe that heterochiral mixed
velocity-magnetic energy triads tend to move energy from magnetic to velocity
fields. Our study is an attempt to further characterize the multi-scale nature
of MHD dynamics, by disentangling different properties of the total energy
transfer mechanisms, which can be useful for improving sub-grid-modelling.

{\epsilon}-Cu were observed in the as-built 17-4PH steels. To design an optimum
post-heat treatment, homogenization was performed at 1050oC for different times
followed by aging at 482oC for 1 hour. It was identified that homogenization
for 1 hour followed by aging leads to the best combination of strength and
ductility due to the refinement of martensite and prior austenite grains.
Improved tensile properties were achieved for the post-heat-treated alloys that
exceeded the traditionally fabricated 17-4PH steels. Through comprehensive
microstructure characterization, it was deduced that the incoherent
{\epsilon}-Cu precipitates in the as-built alloy were dissolved through
homogenization, and subsequently, re-precipitated as coherent Cu-rich clusters
during aging. This study demonstrates that altering the precipitation behavior

one element in connection to coefficients quivers. To be precise, we prove that
the category $\textrm{Rep}(Q,\mathbb{F}_1)$ is equivalent to the (suitably

way to see Euler characteristics of a class of quiver Grassmannians as the
number of ``$\mathbb{F}_1$-rational points'' of quiver Grassmannians. We
generalize techniques originally developed for string and band modules to
compute the Euler characteristics of quiver Grassmannians associated to

explore the Hall algebras associated to $\mathbb{F}_1$-representations of

  arXiv:2102.07647",,,,"math.OC cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main objective of this paper is to outline a theoretical framework to
characterise humans' decision-making strategies under uncertainty, in
particular active learning in a black-box optimization task and trading-off
between information gathering (exploration) and reward seeking (exploitation).
Humans' decisions making according to these two objectives can be modelled in
terms of Pareto rationality. If a decision set contains a Pareto efficient
strategy, a rational decision maker should always select the dominant strategy
over its dominated alternatives. A distance from the Pareto frontier determines
whether a choice is Pareto rational. To collect data about humans' strategies
we have used a gaming application that shows the game field, with previous
decisions and observations, as well as the score obtained. The key element in
this paper is the representation of behavioural patterns of human learners as a
discrete probability distribution. This maps the problem of the
characterization of humans' behaviour into a space whose elements are
probability distributions structured by a distance between histograms, namely
the Wasserstein distance (WST). The distributional analysis gives new insights
about human search strategies and their deviations from Pareto rationality.
Since the uncertainty is one of the two objectives defining the Pareto
frontier, the analysis has been performed for three different uncertainty
quantification measures to identify which better explains the Pareto compliant
behavioural patterns. Beside the analysis of individual patterns WST has also
enabled a global analysis computing the barycenters and WST k-means clustering.
A further analysis has been performed by a decision tree to relate non-Paretian
behaviour, characterized by exasperated exploitation, to the dynamics of the
evolution of the reward seeking process.

Although predicted by theoretical studies, here it is experimentally shown for
the first time that graphene SW/NHR defects have a signature in Raman. Broad
bandwidth of the pertinent Raman features suggests the presence of more than
one SW/NHR defect mode, in agreement with the DFT studies. Variations in the

topological defects at higher energies. Behavior of Raman allowed G and 2D

been investigated in SLG and MLG. These indicate an evolution of defects in
graphene with ion irradiation, as well as presence of a transition state beyond

these aspects with the SW/NHR Raman provide significant insight into ion

distribution (SED) and the intrinsic X-ray absorption, and compare the results
with those from historical observations taken in 2006. We thereby investigate
the effects of the changing-look phenomenon on the accretion-powered radiation
and the ionized outflows. Compared to its normal high-flux state in 2006, the
intrinsic bolometric luminosity of NGC 3516 was lower by a factor of 4 to 8
during 2017. Our SED modeling shows a significant decline in the luminosity of
all the continuum components from the accretion disk and the X-ray source. As a
consequence, the reprocessed X-ray emission lines have also become fainter. The
Swift monitoring of NGC 3516 shows remarkable X-ray spectral variability on
short (weeks) and long (years) timescales. We investigate whether this
variability is driven by obscuration or the intrinsic continuum. We find that
the new low-flux spectrum of NGC 3516, and its variability, do not require any
new or variable obscuration, and instead can be explained by changes in the
ionizing SED that result in lowering of the ionization of the warm-absorber
outflows. This in turn induces enhanced X-ray absorption by the warm-absorber
outflows, mimicking the presence of new obscuring gas. Using the response of
the ionized regions to the SED changes, we place constraints on their density
and location.

the photo-excited particle-hole pairs and cannot be accounted for in a model in

distributions is fundamental to the calculation of information-theoretic
measures such as mutual information and transfer entropy. Common techniques
include variations on histogram estimation which, whilst computationally
efficient, are often unable to precisely capture the probability density of
samples with high correlation, kurtosis or fine substructure, especially when
sample sizes are small. Adaptive partitions, which adjust heuristically to the
sample, can reduce the bias imparted from the geometry of the histogram itself,
but these have commonly focused on the location, scale and granularity of the
partition, the effects of which are limited for highly correlated
distributions. In this paper, I reformulate the differential entropy estimator
for the special case of an equiprobable histogram, using a k-d tree to
partition the sample space into bins of equal probability mass. By doing so, I
expose an implicit rotational orientation parameter, which is conjectured to be
suboptimally specified in the typical marginal alignment. I propose that the
optimal orientation minimises the variance of the bin volumes, and demonstrate
that improved entropy estimates can be obtained by rotationally aligning the
partition to the sample distribution accordingly. Such optimal partitions are
observed to be more accurate than existing techniques in estimating entropies
of correlated bivariate Gaussian distributions with known theoretical values,

retrospective forecasts and observations, as well as an extension to make this

guaranteed to improve calibration and log score performance when trained and
measured in-sample. We also prove that the increase in expected log score of a
recalibrated forecaster is equal to the entropy of the PIT distribution. We
apply this recalibration method to the 27 influenza forecasters in the FluSight

upon several factors. In this work, we focus on collection geometry with
respect to isotropic and anisotropic textures. The low grazing angle of the
collection geometry, combined with orientation of the sonar path relative to
anisotropic texture, poses a significant challenge for image-alignment and
other multi-view scene understanding frameworks. We previously proposed using
features captured from estimated seabed relief to improve scene understanding.
While several methods have been developed to estimate seabed relief via
intensity, no large-scale study exists in the literature. Furthermore, a
dataset of coregistered seabed relief maps and sonar imagery is nonexistent to
learn this domain translation. We address these problems by producing a large
simulated dataset containing coregistered pairs of seabed relief and intensity
maps from two unique sonar data simulation techniques. We apply three types of
models, with varying complexity, to translate intensity imagery to seabed
relief: a Gaussian Markov Random Field approach (GMRF), a conditional
Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN), and UNet architectures. Methods are
compared in reference to the coregistered simulated datasets using L1 error.
Additionally, predictions on simulated and real SAS imagery are shown. Finally,
models are compared on two datasets of hand-aligned SAS imagery and evaluated
in terms of L1 error across multiple aspects in comparison to using intensity.
Our comprehensive experiments show that the proposed UNet architectures
outperform the GMRF and pix2pix cGAN models on seabed relief estimation for
simulated and real SAS imagery.

connecting the scattered field with the field of the oncoming PPWs, that is
valid for any strength of the scattering and dissipative properties of the
conducting half-space. As a measure of scattering strength, the Hilbert norm of
the intermode scattering operator is used. It is shown that the intensity of
the scattering is not only determined by the parameters of the random impedance
(the variance, correlation radius, the length of the heterogenious region), but
it also crucially depends on the metal substrate conductivity. For a small norm
of the integral operator, the incident surface plasmon polariton (SPP) radiates
effectively into vacuum, loosing the part of its energy for excitation of
quasi-isotropic Norton-type waves above the conducting surface. The intensity
of the leaking field is expressed in terms of the pair correlation function of
the impedance, the dependence of which on wave numbers of incident and
scattered waves demonstrates the possibility to observe a phenomenon similar to
Wood's anomalies of wave scattering by periodic lattices. With strong
scattering, when the norm of the scattering operator becomes large as compared
to unity, the radiation into the volume is highly suppressed and the PPW is
basically mirrored from the heterogeneous surface area in backward direction.
In the model of dissipationless conducting halfspace, the surface
plasmon-polariton becomes unstable for arbitrarily small fluctuations of the
conductor polarizability. The mirroring also takes place at small norm of the
scattering operator, yet in this case it is related to Anderson's localization
of the SPP within the disordered region.

for the problem of acoustic scattering by a two-dimensional surface in
three-dimensional space. The approach is based, in part, on the novel
Interpolated Factored Green Function acceleration method (IFGF) that, without
recourse to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), evaluates the action of Green
function-based integral operators for an $N$-point surface discretization at a
complexity of $\Ord(N\log N)$ operations instead of the $\Ord(N^2)$ cost
associated with nonaccelerated methods. The IFGF algorithm exploits the slow
variations of factored Green functions to enable the fast evaluation of fields
generated by groups of sources on the basis of a recursive interpolation
scheme. In the proposed approach, the IFGF method is used to account for the
vast majority of the computations, while, for the relatively few singular,
nearly-singular and neighboring non-singular integral operator evaluations, a
high-order rectangular-polar quadrature approach is employed instead. Since the
overall approach does not rely on the FFT, it is amenable to efficient shared-
and distributed-memory parallelization; this paper demonstrates such a
capability by means of an OpenMP parallel implementation of the method. A
variety of numerical examples presented in this paper demonstrate that the
proposed methods enable the efficient solution of large problems over complex
geometries on small parallel hardware infrastructures. Numerical examples
include acoustic scattering by a sphere of up to $128$ wavelengths, an
$80$-wavelength submarine, and a turbofan nacelle that is more than $80$

cross-domain few-shot anomaly detection, which can transfer knowledge learned
from numerous videos in the source domain to help solve few-shot abnormality
detection in the target domain. Concretely, we leverage self-supervised
training on the target normal videos to reduce the domain gap and devise a meta

few-shot setting. Our experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms baseline methods on DoTA and UCF-Crime datasets, and the new task
contributes to a more practical training paradigm for anomaly detection.

standard accuracy and do not generalize well to novel attacks. Recent works
show generalization improvement with adversarial samples under novel threat
models such as on-manifold threat model or neural perceptual threat model.
However, the former requires exact manifold information while the latter
requires algorithm relaxation. Motivated by these considerations, we exploit
the underlying manifold information with Normalizing Flow, ensuring that exact

Joint Space Threat Model (JSTM), which can serve as a special case of the
neural perceptual threat model that does not require additional relaxation to
craft the corresponding adversarial attacks. Under JSTM, we develop novel
adversarial attacks and defenses. The mixup strategy improves the standard

tackle this issue, we propose the Robust Mixup strategy in which we maximize
the adversity of the interpolated images and gain robustness and prevent
overfitting. Our experiments show that Interpolated Joint Space Adversarial

modes with a high amplitude of vibrations of surface atoms, which indicates
their strong damping. Taking into account the difference in the damping of
different modes and their calculated intensities, all bands in the spectra are
unambiguously identified. It is found that the frequencies of longitudinal
optical modes in heterostructures are close to the frequencies of LO phonons in

differ significantly from those of the corresponding TO phonons. It is shown
that an anomalous thickness dependence of CdS TO mode is due to a noticeable

the agent's observed consequences of its actions. This illustration shows
twelve separate layers: the lowest consisting of raw pixels, touch and force
sensors, and a small number of actions; the higher layers increasing in
abstraction, eventually resulting in rich knowledge about the agent's world,

that this general mechanism may allow the representation of a broad spectrum of

  holes","26 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is generally accepted that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grew from
progenitor seeds; but it remains unclear when the seeds formed, how large they
were, and what were their growth rates. This study finds answers to such open
questions in an analysis and interpretation of available mass (MBH) and age (t)
data of SMBHs at z>5.7. Their distribution reveals that a significant number
(36) spread over 300 million years (Myr) of cosmic time have markedly similar
masses (within a factor of 2) even though MBH depends on age. Besides age, MBH
depends upon seed mass Ms, origin time ts, and a variable dubbed accretion
ratio AR. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the 36 SMBHs had
similar-size seeds that formed essentially concurrently and that AR is
inversely proportional to t. Consequently, we get 36 equations with 1 variable
(t) and 3 parameters. Solving these equations using the SANN method, the
optimum values of the parameters define AR as a function of age t, and MBH as a
function of Ms and t. These relationships are tested and applied to thousands
of SMBHs. The results indicate that ts ~100Myr (z=30); that SMBHS > 1E+09M*
(solar masses) require seeds > 1E+03M* but < 5E+04M*; that seeds grew at an
exponentially increasing rate that reached a maximum near z=7 and decreased
thereafter; that seeds may have initially experienced a short period (150 Myr)
of super-Eddington accretion or accretion efficiency much <0.1; that about half
of the growth occurs from z=30-3.5 and the rest thereafter, and that accretion
is the predominant mode of growth with an upper limit of 2.2E+06Ms or
MBH=(6.7+/-2)E+10M*. This study provides quantitative estimates of accretion
rates, constraints for models of seed formation, and insights into the origins

quarks in lattice QCD, while the range of its applicability has been sometimes
questioned. We study the convergence and the valid range of the hopping
parameter expansion in the determination of the critical point (critical quark
mass) of QCD with heavy quarks at finite temperature and density. On lattices
with sufficiently large spatial extent, the terms in the hopping parameter
expansion are classified into Wilson loop terms and Polyakov-type loop terms.
We first study the case of the worst convergence in which all the gauge link
variables are unit matrices and thus the Wilson loops and the Polyakov-type
loops get their maximum values. We perform explicit calculation up to more than
100th order of the hopping parameter expansion. We show that the hopping
parameter expansion is convergent up to the chiral limit of free Wilson quarks.
We then perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to measure correlation among
Polyakov-type loop terms up to the 20th order of the hopping parameter
expansion. In previous studies, strong correlation between the leading order
Polyakov loop term and the next-to-leading order bent Polyakov loop terms was
reported and used to construct an effective theory to incorporate the
next-to-leading order effect by a shift of the leading order coupling
parameter. We establish that the strong correlation among Polyakov-type loop
terms holds also at higher orders of the hopping parameter expansion, and
extend the effective theory to incorporate higher-order effects up to high
orders. Using the effective theory, we study the truncation error of the
hopping parameter expansion. We find that the previous next-to-leading order
result of the critical point for $N_t=4$ are well reliable. For $N_t \ge 6$, we
need to incorporate higher-order effects in the effective theory.

asking whether no more than k-1 objects are located inside the circle centered

a significant impact on our daily life. Forecasting such events is of great
importance for decision-making and resource allocation. Event prediction has
traditionally been challenging due to the lack of knowledge regarding the true
causes and underlying mechanisms of event occurrence. In recent years, research
on event forecasting has made significant progress due to two main reasons: (1)
the development of machine learning and deep learning algorithms and (2) the
accessibility of public data such as social media, news sources, blogs,
economic indicators, and other meta-data sources. The explosive growth of data
and the remarkable advancement in software/hardware technologies have led to
applications of deep learning techniques in societal event studies. This paper
is dedicated to providing a systematic and comprehensive overview of deep
learning technologies for societal event predictions. We focus on two domains
of societal events: \textit{civil unrest} and \textit{crime}. We first
introduce how event forecasting problems are formulated as a machine learning
prediction task. Then, we summarize data resources, traditional methods, and
recent development of deep learning models for these problems. Finally, we
discuss the challenges in societal event forecasting and put forward some
promising directions for future research.

state-of-the-art performance on the personalized dialog generation dataset:
Persona-Chat. With values as additional features, existing emotion recognition

improves the empathetic response generation performance in the
EmpatheticDialogues dataset. To the best of our knowledge, ValueNet is the
first large-scale text dataset for human value modeling, and we are the first

alloys is crucial for the development and design of high-performance materials

process and, despite having been studied for decades, the microscopic aspects
that govern the crystallization mechanism of a material remain to date elusive.
Recent evidence shows that spatial heterogeneity in the supercooled liquid,
characterised by extended regions with distinctive mobility and order, may be a
key microscopic factor that determines the mechanism of crystal nucleation.
These findings have advanced our view of the fundamental nature of
crystallization, as most research has assumed that crystal clusters nucleate
from random fluctuations in a `homogeneous' liquid. Here, by analysing
transition path sampling trajectories, we show that dynamical heterogeneity
plays a key role in the mechanism of crystal nucleation in an elemental metal,
nickel. Our results demonstrate that crystallization occurs preferentially in
regions of low mobility in the supercooled liquid, evidencing the collective
dynamical nature of crystal nucleation in Ni. In addition, our results show
that low mobility regions form before and spatially overlap with pre-ordered
domains that act as precursors to the crystal phase that subsequently emerges.
Our results show a clear link between dynamical and structural heterogeneity in
the supercooled liquid and its impact on the nucleation mechanism, revealing
microscopic descriptors that could pave a novel way to control crystallization
processes in metals.

reduce demand for seaborne thermal coal and amplify the effect of

horizon is considered to be in thermal equilibrium. In the present article,
both the energy stored on the horizon and its thermodynamic fluctuations are
examined through the holographic equipartition law. First, it is confirmed that
a flat Friedmann--Robertson--Walker universe approaches a de Sitter universe,
using a cosmological model close to lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM)
models. Then, based on the holographic equipartition law, the energy density of
the Hubble volume is calculated from the energy on the Hubble horizon of a de
Sitter universe. The energy density for a de Sitter universe is constant and
the order of the energy density is consistent with the order of that for the
observed cosmological constant. Second, thermodynamic fluctuations of energy on
the horizon are examined, assuming stable fluctuations around thermal
equilibrium states. A standard formulation of the fluctuations for a canonical
ensemble is applied to the Hubble horizon of a de Sitter universe. The
thermodynamic fluctuations of the energy are found to be a universal constant
corresponding to the Planck energy, regardless of the Hubble parameter. In
contrast, the relative fluctuations of the energy can be characterized by the
ratio of the one-degree-of-freedom energy to the Planck energy. At the present
time, the order of the relative fluctuations should be within the range of a
discrepancy derived from a discussion of the cosmological constant problem,
namely a range approximately from $10^{-60}$ to $10^{-123}$. The present
results may imply that the energy stored on the Hubble horizon is related to a
kind of effective dark energy, whereas the energy that can be `maximally'
stored on the horizon may behave as if it were a kind of effective vacuum-like
energy in an extended holographic equipartition law.

solution to a second-order partial differential equation (PDE). Using a limit
of experiments approach, we show that this PDE characterization also holds
asymptotically under both parametric and non-parametric distributions of the

asymptotically sufficient to restrict attention to, and thereby suggests a
practical strategy for dimension reduction. The PDEs characterizing minimal

the optimal Bayes and minimax policies from their numerical solutions. These
optimal policies substantially dominate existing methods such as Thompson

through the analysis of repeated quantum measurements, is an important tool for
validating the operation of a quantum processor. We detail the combined use of
an existing QPT approach based on tensor networks (TNs) and unsupervised
learning with TN contraction path finding algorithms in order to use TNs of
arbitrary topologies for reconstruction. Experiments were conducted on the
7-qubit IBM Quantum Falcon Processor ibmq_casablanca, where we demonstrate this
technique by matching the topology of the tensor networks used for
reconstruction with the topology of the processor, allowing us to extend past
the characterisation of linear nearest neighbour circuits. Furthermore, we
conduct single-qubit gate set tomography (GST) on each individual qubit to
correct for separable errors during the state preparation and measurement
phases of QPT, which are separate from the channel under consideration but may
negatively impact the quality of its reconstruction. We are able to report a
fidelity of 0.89 against the ideal unitary channel of a single-cycle random
quantum circuit performed on ibmq_casablanca, after obtaining just $1.1 \times
10^5$ measurements for the reconstruction of this 7-qubit process. This
represents more than five orders of magnitude fewer total measurements than the

mid-infrared, or X-ray emission or through the presence of broad and/or narrow
emission lines. AGN can also leave an imprint on a galaxy's spectral energy
distribution (SED) through the re-processing of photons by the dusty torus.
Using the SED fitting code ProSpect with an incorporated AGN component, we fit
the far ultraviolet to far-infrared SEDs of $\sim$494,00 galaxies in the
D10-COSMOS field and $\sim$230,000 galaxies from the GAMA survey. By combining
an AGN component with a flexible star formation and metallicity implementation,
we obtain estimates for the AGN luminosities, stellar masses, star formation
histories, and metallicity histories for each of our galaxies. We find that
ProSpect can identify AGN components in 91 per cent of galaxies pre-selected as
containing AGN through narrow-emission line ratios and the presence of broad
lines. Our ProSpect-derived AGN luminosities show close agreement with
luminosities derived for X-ray selected AGN using both the X-ray flux and
previous SED fitting results. We show that incorporating the flexibility of an
AGN component when fitting the SEDs of galaxies with no AGN has no significant
impact on the derived galaxy properties. However, in order to obtain accurate
estimates of the stellar properties of AGN host galaxies, it is crucial to
include an AGN component in the SED fitting process. We use our derived AGN
luminosities to map the evolution of the AGN luminosity function for $0<z<2$

effect on resonance frequency, but, interestingly, attenuation of the SAW can
decrease significantly in the high frequency region as the interface damping

our theory; the experimental results show similar trends both for resonant

one-way functions really necessary for commitments in the quantum world? In
this work, we show that non-interactive quantum commitments (for classical

where the dependencies among sub-tasks can be naturally established within the
auto-regressive decoder. Compared with previous works, it has three advantages:
(1) it fits in the pretraining pattern of masked language models, and thereby
can benefit from the semantic prompts of each sub-task rather than treating
them as atomic labels, (2) it utilizes a single unified architecture, enabling
full parameter sharing across all sub-tasks, and (3) it can incorporate both
classification and generative sub-tasks. We show that this unified transformer,
albeit pretrained on general-domain text, outperforms pretrained models
tailored specifically for the legal domain. Through an extensive set of
experiments, we find that the best order to capture dependencies is different
from human intuitions, and the most reasonable logical order for humans can be
sub-optimal for the model. We further include two more auxiliary tasks: court
view generation and article content prediction, showing they can not only
improve the prediction accuracy, but also provide interpretable explanations
for model outputs even when an error is made. With the best configuration, our

predominant trend of the noise spectral density, S, dependence on the current

of graph theory, a method is proposed that automatically splits a complex line
topology with branches into several one-dimensional lines. The problem of
short-circuit fault location in the branching lines is then transformed into
several one-dimensional optimization problems, which are then solved by the
optimization algorithm. This solves the problem of realizing rapid location in
a power network with branches. Numerical experiments are carried out in a
distribution network model to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
Results under different conditions show the method works reliably and
efficiently.

modified version named as dynamic exploitation Gaussian bare-bones bat
algorithm (DeGBBBA) are proposed for solving optimal reactive power dispatch
(ORPD) problem. The optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) plays a fundamental
role in ensuring stable, secure, reliable as well as economical operation of
the power system. The ORPD problem is formulated as a complex and nonlinear
optimization problem of mixed integers including both discrete and continuous
control variables. Bat algorithm (BA) is one of the most popular metaheuristic
algorithms which mimics the echolocation of the microbats and which has also
outperformed some other metaheuristic algorithms in solving various
optimization problems. Nevertheless, the standard BA may fail to balance
exploration and exploitation for some optimization problems and hence it may
often fall into local optima. The proposed GBBBA employs the Gaussian
distribution in updating the bat positions in an effort to mitigate the
premature convergence problem associated with the standard BA. The GBBBA takes
advantages of Gaussian sampling which begins from exploration and continues to
exploitation. DeGBBBA is an advanced variant of GBBBA in which a modified
Gaussian distribution is introduced so as to allow the dynamic adaptation of
exploitation and exploitation in the proposed algorithm. Both GBBBA and DeGBBBA
are used to determine the optimal settings of generator bus voltages, tap
setting transformers and shunt reactive sources in order to minimize the active
power loss, total voltage deviations and voltage stability index. Simulation
results show that GBBBA and DeGBBBA are robust and effective in solving the
ORPD problem.

the theoretical limits, astrometry would allow for the detection of smaller

Sun-like star due to magnetic activity in its photosphere induces apparent
variability in the photocenter of order $0.5\ \textrm{m}R_\odot$. This jitter
creates a fundamental astrophysical noise floor preventing detection of
lower-mass planets in a single spectral band. By injecting planet orbits into
simulated solar data at five different passbands, we investigate mitigation of
this fundamental astrometric noise using correlations across passbands. For a
true solar analog and a planet at 1 au semimajor axis, the $6\sigma$ detection
limit set by stellar activity for an ideal telescope at the best single
passband is $0.01$ Earth masses. We found that pairs of passbands with highly
correlated astrometric jitter due to stellar activity, but with less motion in
the redder band, enable higher-precision measurements of the common signal from
the planet. Using this method improves detectable planet masses at 1 au by up
to a factor of $10$, corresponding to at best $0.005$ Earth masses for a
Sun-like star with a perfect telescope. Given these results, we recommend that
future astrometry missions consider proceeding with two or more passbands to
reduce noise due to stellar activity.

usually assumed to be sampled from the same distribution. When part of the test
samples are drawn from a distribution that is sufficiently far away from that
of the training samples (a.k.a. out-of-distribution (OOD) samples), the trained
neural network has a tendency to make high confidence predictions for these OOD
samples. Detection of the OOD samples is critical when training a neural
network used for image classification, object detection, etc. It can enhance
the classifier's robustness to irrelevant inputs, and improve the system
resilience and security under different forms of attacks. Detection of OOD
samples has three main challenges: (i) the proposed OOD detection method should
be compatible with various architectures of classifiers (e.g., DenseNet,
ResNet), without significantly increasing the model complexity and requirements
on computational resources; (ii) the OOD samples may come from multiple
distributions, whose class labels are commonly unavailable; (iii) a score
function needs to be defined to effectively separate OOD samples from

Wasserstein-based out-of-distribution detection (WOOD) method. The basic idea
is to define a Wasserstein-distance-based score that evaluates the
dissimilarity between a test sample and the distribution of InD samples. An
optimization problem is then formulated and solved based on the proposed score

to guarantee that the loss value achieved by the empirical optimizer

electric-toroidal dipole moments. To describe local electric polarizations
originating from the disproportionation of localized electronic clouds, we
introduce a two-dimensional three-orbital model with localized $s$ and two $p$

neighboring one as dipole-dipole interactions. We find that a vortex-type
configuration of local electric polarizations appears as a mean-field ground
state, corresponding to a ferro-type electric-toroidal dipole order. By taking
account of collective modes from this ordered state, we calculate the
coefficient of the thermopolarization based on the linear response theory. The
antisymmetric component is nonzero in the presence of the electric-toroidal
dipole order. We clarify that fluctuations in the $p$ orbitals are crucial in
enhancing the antisymmetric thermopolarization. We discuss the appearance

that the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the lift of degeneracy in the

collective observability condition. In particular, the steady-state covariance
matrix can be simplified as the solution to a discrete-time Lyapunov equation.
Moreover, the performance degradation induced by reduced fusion frequency is
obtained in closed form, which establishes an analytical relation between the
performance of the CMDF with finite fusion steps and that of centralized

barriers to the wide-spread adoption of FHE. In this paper, we present an
in-depth architectural analysis of the bootstrapping step in FHE. First, we
observe that secure implementations of bootstrapping exhibit a low arithmetic
intensity (<1 Op/byte), require large caches (>100 MB), and are heavily bound
by the main memory bandwidth. Consequently, we demonstrate that existing
workloads observe marginal performance gains from the design of bespoke
high-throughput arithmetic units tailored to FHE. Second, we propose several
cache-friendly algorithmic optimizations that improve the throughput in FHE
bootstrapping by enabling up to 3.2x higher arithmetic intensity and 4.6x lower

similar computations such as private evaluation and training of machine
learning models. Finally, we incorporate these optimizations into an

parameters to maximize the bootstrapping throughput. Our optimized
bootstrapping implementation represents a best-case scenario for compute
acceleration of FHE. We show that despite these optimizations, bootstrapping

  Relevance Feedback: A Reproducibility Study","Accepted at ECIR 2022",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) utilises the relevance signals from the top-k
passages from the first round of retrieval to perform a second round of
retrieval aiming to improve search effectiveness. A recent research direction
has been the study and development of PRF methods for deep language models
based rankers, and in particular in the context of dense retrievers. Dense
retrievers, compared to more complex neural rankers, provide a trade-off
between effectiveness, which is often reduced compared to more complex neural
rankers, and query latency, which also is reduced making the retrieval pipeline
more efficient. The introduction of PRF methods for dense retrievers has been
motivated as an attempt to further improve their effectiveness.
  In this paper, we reproduce and study a recent method for PRF with dense
retrievers, called ANCE-PRF. This method concatenates the query text and that
of the top-k feedback passages to form a new query input, which is then encoded
into a dense representation using a newly trained query encoder based on the
original dense retriever used for the first round of retrieval. While the
method can potentially be applied to any of the existing dense retrievers,
prior work has studied it only in the context of the ANCE dense retriever.
  We study the reproducibility of ANCE-PRF in terms of both its training
(encoding of the PRF signal) and inference (ranking) steps. We further extend
the empirical analysis provided in the original work to investigate the effect
of the hyper-parameters that govern the training process and the robustness of
the method across these different settings. Finally, we contribute a study of
the generalisability of the ANCE-PRF method when dense retrievers other than
ANCE are used for the first round of retrieval and for encoding the PRF signal.

which aims to transfer structure information from guidance image to target
image. Most existing methods construct filter kernels from the guidance itself
without considering the mutual dependency between the guidance and the target.
However, since there typically exist significantly different edges in the two
images, simply transferring all structural information of the guidance to the
target would result in various artifacts. To cope with this problem, we propose
an effective framework named deep attentional guided image filtering, the
filtering process of which can fully integrate the complementary information
contained in both images. Specifically, we propose an attentional kernel
learning module to generate dual sets of filter kernels from the guidance and
the target, respectively, and then adaptively combine them by modeling the
pixel-wise dependency between the two images. Meanwhile, we propose a
multi-scale guided image filtering module to progressively generate the
filtering result with the constructed kernels in a coarse-to-fine manner.
Correspondingly, a multi-scale fusion strategy is introduced to reuse the
intermediate results in the coarse-to-fine process. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed framework compares favorably with the state-of-the-art
methods in a wide range of guided image filtering applications, such as guided
super-resolution, cross-modality restoration, texture removal, and semantic
segmentation.

purchase decisions. To manipulate a product's reputation, many stores hire
large numbers of people to produce fake reviews to mislead customers. Previous
methods tackle this problem by detecting malicious individuals, ignoring the
fact that the spam activities are often formed in groups, where individuals
work collectively to write fake reviews. Fake reviewer group detection,
however, is more challenging due to the difficulties in capturing the
underlying relationships in groups. In this work, we present an unsupervised
and end-to-end approach for fake reviewer group detection in online reviews.
Specifically, our method can be summarized into two procedures. First,
cohensive groups are detected with modularity-based graph convolutional
networks. Then the suspiciousness of each group is measured by several anomaly
indicators from both individual and group levels. The fake reviewer groups can
be finally detected through suspiciousness. Extensive experiments are conducted
on real-world datasets, and the results show that our proposed method is
effective in detecting fake reviewer groups compared with the state-of-the-art
baselines.

dominate star formation. A next-generation space mission with capabilities
moderately superior to those of CDIM will be able to probe this scenario by
measuring the He II and H$\alpha$ fluctuation power spectrum signals and their
cross-correlation at high significance up to $z\sim 20$. Moreover, regardless
of the IMF, a ratio value of He II/H$\alpha \lesssim 0.01$ indicates low
Population III star formation and, therefore, it signals the end of the period

He II power spectrum may be only possible for top-heavy Population III IMFs or
through cross-correlation with the stronger H$\alpha$ signal. Finally, ratio

interpret because they can be driven by several competing effects. We discuss
how various measurements at different redshifts and the combination of the

engineering where machine learning becomes the new software, powered by big

striking observation is that a significant portion of the machine learning
process is spent on data preparation. Without good data, even the best machine
learning algorithms cannot perform well. As a result, data-centric AI practices
are now becoming mainstream. Unfortunately, many datasets in the real world are
small, dirty, biased, and even poisoned. In this survey, we study the research
landscape for data collection and data quality primarily for deep learning
applications. Data collection is important because there is lesser need for
feature engineering for recent deep learning approaches, but instead more need
for large amounts of data. For data quality, we study data validation,
cleaning, and integration techniques. Even if the data cannot be fully cleaned,
we can still cope with imperfect data during model training using robust model
training techniques. In addition, while bias and fairness have been less
studied in traditional data management research, these issues become essential
topics in modern machine learning applications. We thus study fairness measures
and unfairness mitigation techniques that can be applied before, during, or
after model training. We believe that the data management community is well
poised to solve these problems.

computational efficiency, machine learning techniques have been used to create
accelerated data-driven approximations for CFD. A majority of such approaches
rely on large labeled CFD datasets that are expensive to obtain at the scale

We achieve state-of-the-art results without any labeled simulation data, but
using a custom data-driven and physics-informed loss function by using and
small-scale solutions to prime the model to solve the N-S equations. To improve
the resolution and predictability, we train stacked models of increasing
complexity generating the numerical solutions for N-S equations. Without
expensive computations, our model achieves high predictability with a variety

an experimentally achievable three-component Fermi-Hubbard model of

We find the long-range antiferromagnetic order of such a three-component

low-switching-cost RL, i.e., achieving the highest reward while reducing the

theoretical studies aiming to design provably efficient RL algorithms with low
switching costs, none of the existing approaches have been thoroughly evaluated

extensive experiments on a medical treatment environment, the Atari games, and
robotic control tasks, we present the first empirical benchmark for
low-switching-cost RL and report novel findings on how to decrease the
switching cost while maintain a similar sample efficiency to the case without
the low-switching-cost constraint. We hope this benchmark could serve as a

Interestingly, the scalable subagging estimator can be tuned to have the same

patterns are produced through systematic pedestrian surveys. Recently,
systematic manual survey of satellite and aerial imagery has enabled continuous
distributional views of archaeological phenomena at interregional scales.
However, such 'brute force' manual imagery survey methods are both time- and
labor-intensive, as well as prone to inter-observer differences in sensitivity
and specificity. The development of self-supervised learning methods offers a
scalable learning scheme for locating archaeological features using unlabeled
satellite and historical aerial images. However, archaeological features are
generally only visible in a very small proportion relative to the landscape,
while the modern contrastive-supervised learning approach typically yields an
inferior performance on highly imbalanced datasets. In this work, we propose a
framework to address this long-tail problem. As opposed to the existing
contrastive learning approaches that treat the labelled and unlabeled data
separately, our proposed method reforms the learning paradigm under a
semi-supervised setting in order to utilize the precious annotated data (<7% in

employed as the prior knowledge in order to form pseudo negative pairs by
ranking the similarities between unannotated image patches and annotated anchor

ruler in the galaxy 2-Point Correlation Function (2PCF). In order to measure
the distance scale, one dilates and contracts a template for the 2PCF in a
fiducial cosmology, using a scaling factor $\alpha$. The standard method for
finding the best-fit $\alpha$ is to compute the likelihood over a grid of
roughly 100 values of it. This approach is slow; in this work, we propose a
significantly faster way. Our method writes the 2PCF as a polynomial in
$\alpha$ by Taylor-expanding it about $\alpha = 1$, exploiting that we know the
fiducial cosmology sufficiently well that $\alpha$ is within a few percent of
unity. The likelihood resulting from this expansion may then be analytically
solved for the best-fit $\alpha$. Our method is 48-85$\times$ faster than a

by the long-range Coulomb interaction in a two-dimensional semi-Dirac
semimetal. This kind of semimetal may be realized in deformed graphene and a
class of other realistic materials. In the non-interacting limit, the
dispersion of semi-Dirac fermion is linear in one direction and quadratic in
the other direction. When the impact of Coulomb interaction is taken into
account, such a dispersion can be significantly modified. To reveal the
correlation effects, we first obtain the exact self-consistent Dyson-Schwinger
equation of the full fermion propagator and then extract the momentum
dependence of the renormalized fermion dispersion from the numerical solutions.
Our results show that the fermion dispersion becomes linear in two directions.
These results are compared to previous theoretical works on semi-Dirac
semimetals.

the gripper grasps the puller, which hides the bag state such as the direction

a model that can perform contact-rich flexible object manipulation by real-time

results of experiments using a real robot arm revealed that our method can
realize motions responding to the deformation of the bag while reducing the

as a malicious target sentence by ASR systems. Several methods have been
proposed to generate audio adversarial examples and feed them directly into the

feasibility of robust physical audio adversarial examples(over-air). To defend
against the attacks, several studies have been proposed. However, deploying
them in a real-world situation is difficult because of accuracy drop or time

the ASR. We show that carefully selected noise can significantly impact the

transcription altered by logit noising with its original transcription. The
proposed method can be easily applied to ASR systems without any structural

prevailing low-contrast and weak-visibility problems of single RGB images. In
this paper, we respond to the intriguing learning-related question -- if
leveraging both accessible unpaired over/underexposed images and high-level
semantic guidance, can improve the performance of cutting-edge LLE models?
Here, we propose an effective semantically contrastive learning paradigm for
LLE (namely SCL-LLE). Beyond the existing LLE wisdom, it casts the image
enhancement task as multi-task joint learning, where LLE is converted into
three constraints of contrastive learning, semantic brightness consistency, and
feature preservation for simultaneously ensuring the exposure, texture, and
color consistency. SCL-LLE allows the LLE model to learn from unpaired
positives (normal-light)/negatives (over/underexposed), and enables it to
interact with the scene semantics to regularize the image enhancement network,
yet the interaction of high-level semantic knowledge and the low-level signal
prior is seldom investigated in previous methods. Training on readily available
open data, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the
state-of-the-arts LLE models over six independent cross-scenes datasets.
Moreover, SCL-LLE's potential to benefit the downstream semantic segmentation
under extremely dark conditions is discussed. Source Code:

has super-human performance in that no human being would be able to achieve
such amounts of exploration. To address this problem, we focus on the
\textit{satisficing} policy, which is a qualitatively different approach from
that of existing optimization algorithms. Thus, we propose Linear RS (LinRS),
which is a type of satisficing algorithm and a linear extension of
risk-sensitive satisficing (RS), for application to a wider range of tasks. The
generalization of RS provides an algorithm to reduce the volume of exploratory
actions by adopting a different approach from existing optimization algorithms.
LinRS utilizes linear regression and multiclass classification to linearly
approximate both the action value and proportion of action selections required
in the RS calculation. The results of our experiments indicate that LinRS
reduced the number of explorations and run time compared to those of existing
algorithms in contextual bandit problems. These results suggest that a further
generalization of satisficing algorithms may be useful for complex
environments, including those that are to be handled with deep reinforcement

are caused by the vulnerabilities present in these devices. In addition,
although international standards define tasks to assess vulnerabilities, they
do not specify any particular method. Having a secure design is important, but
is also complex, costly, and an extra factor to manage during the lifespan of
the device. This paper presents a model to analyze the known vulnerabilities of
industrial components over time. The proposed model is based on two main
elements: a directed graph representation of the internal structure of the
component, and a set of quantitative metrics that are based on international
security standards; such as, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).
This model is applied throughout the entire lifespan of a device to track
vulnerabilities, identify new requirements, root causes, and test cases. The
proposed model also helps to prioritize patching activities. To test its
potential, the proposed model is applied to the OpenPLC project. The results
show that most of the root causes of these vulnerabilities are related to
memory buffer operations and are concentrated in the \textit{libssl} library.
Consequently, new requirements and test cases were generated from the obtained

well-labeled data that does not have noise and imbalanced distribution
problems, learning DDMs is always challenging. Existing methods usually tackle
these challenges through learning more discriminative features or re-weighting
samples. We argue that learning DDMs gradually, from easy to hard, is more
reasonable, for two reasons. First, this is more consistent with the cognitive
process of human beings. Second, noisy as well as underrepresented examples can
be distinguished by virtue of previously learned knowledge. Thus, we resort to
a gradual learning strategy -- self-paced learning (SPL). Then, a natural
question arises: can SPL lead DDMs to achieve more robust and less biased
solutions? To answer this question, this paper proposes a new SPL method: easy
and underrepresented examples first, for learning DDMs. This tackles the
fundamental ranking and selection problem in SPL from a new perspective:
fairness. Our idea is fundamental and can be easily combined with a variety of
DDMs. Extensive experimental results on three computer vision tasks, i.e.,
facial age estimation, head pose estimation, and gaze estimation, show our new
method gains considerable performance improvement in both accuracy and

  of Transformer","13 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sequential recommendation can capture user chronological preferences from
their historical behaviors, yet the learning of short sequences (cold-start
problem) in many benchmark datasets is still an open challenge. Recently, data
augmentation with pseudo-prior items generated by Transformers has drawn
considerable attention. These methods can generate pseudo-prior items
sequentially in reverse chronological order to extend the original sequences.
Nevertheless, the performance may still dramatically degrade in very short
sequences; most notably, the generation of pseudo-prior items does not take
into account the forward direction (from the past to the future), and so the
underlying temporal correlations are not preserved in terms of conditional
probabilities. Motivated by this, we propose a Bidirectional Chronological
Augmentation of Transformer (BiCAT) that uses a forward learning constraint in
the reverse generative process to capture contextual information more
effectively. Then, self-knowledge distillation is adopted in augmented and
original sequences to bridge the gap between data augmentation and model
representation, which enhances the robustness of sequence encoder. Moreover, an
informative positive and negative sampling strategy is proposed to accelerate
optimization and prevent overfitting. Extensive experiments on two popular
real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method on very short
sequences (L < 3) and long sequences (20 < L < 50) as well, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art models by an average of 35.04% and 8.76%
respectively, in terms of Recall@5. Source code is available at

a CsCl-type structure at high pressures. When the superconductivity of the

specific star formation rate as a function of local density in a LSS at
$z=0.735$ in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. The LSS is mapped by 732
galaxies with $R<24$\,mag and redshift at $0.72\le z \le 0.75$ collected from
the literature and our spectroscopic observations with Magellan/IMACS,
consisting of five galaxy clusters/groups and surrounding filaments over an
area of $23.9 \times22.7$\,co-moving\,Mpc$^2$. The spread of spectroscopic
redshifts corresponds a velocity dispersion of 494\,km\,s$^{-1}$, indicating
the LSS likely to be a thin sheet with a galaxy density $\gtrsim 3.9$ times
that of the general field. These clusters/groups in this LSS mostly exhibit
elongated morphologies and multiple components connected with surrounding
filaments. Strikingly, we find that star-forming galaxies in the LSS keep star
formation at the same level as field, and show no dependence on local density
but stellar mass. Meanwhile, an increasing fraction of quiescent galaxies is
detected at increasing local density in both the LSS and the field, consistent
with the expectation that galaxy mass and local dense environment hold the key
to quench star formation. Combined together, we conclude that the cosmic
environment of the LSS overtakes the local environment in remaining galaxy star
formation to the level of the field.

attention. Most of the work utilizes image information through region-level
visual representations obtained from a pretrained object detector and relies on
an attention mechanism to model the interactions between image and text
representations. However, it is difficult to model such interactions as image
and text representations are trained separately on the data of their respective
modality and are not aligned in the same space. As text representations take
the most important role in MNER, in this paper, we propose {\bf I}mage-{\bf
t}ext {\bf A}lignments (ITA) to align image features into the textual space, so
that the attention mechanism in transformer-based pretrained textual embeddings
can be better utilized. ITA first aligns the image into regional object tags,
image-level captions and optical characters as visual contexts, concatenates
them with the input texts as a new cross-modal input, and then feeds it into a
pretrained textual embedding model. This makes it easier for the attention
module of a pretrained textual embedding model to model the interaction between
the two modalities since they are both represented in the textual space. ITA
further aligns the output distributions predicted from the cross-modal input
and textual input views so that the MNER model can be more practical in dealing
with text-only inputs and robust to noises from images. In our experiments, we
show that ITA models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on multi-modal Named
Entity Recognition datasets, even without image information.

rate well below the Eddington limit, manifesting themselves as low-luminosity
active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). The prevalence of a hot wind from LLAGNs is a
generic prediction by theories and numerical simulations of black hole
accretion and is recently becoming a crucial ingredient of AGN kinetic feedback
in cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution. However, direct observational
evidence for this hot wind is still scarce. In this work, we identify
significant Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ and Fe XXV K$\alpha$ emission lines from
high-resolution Chandra grating spectra of the LLAGN in NGC\,7213, a nearby Sa
galaxy hosting a $\sim10^8\rm~M_\odot$ SMBH, confirming previous work. We find
that these lines exhibit a blueshifted line-of-sight velocity of
$\sim1100\rm~km s^{-1}$ and a high XXVI Ly$\alpha$ to XXV K$\alpha$ flux ratio
implying for a $\sim16$ keV hot plasma. By confronting these spectral features
with synthetic X-ray spectra based on our custom magnetohydrodynamical
simulations, we find that the high-velocity, hot plasma is naturally explained
by the putative hot wind driven by the hot accretion flow powering this LLAGN.
Alternative plausible origins of this hot plasma, including stellar activities,
AGN photoionization and the hot accretion flow itself, are quantitatively
disfavored. The inferred kinetic energy and momentum carried by the wind can
serve as strong feedback to the environment. We compare NGC\,7213 to M81*, in
which strong evidence for a hot wind was recently presented, and discuss
implications on the universality and detectability of hot winds from LLAGNs.

from the fully synchronized cluster and becomes incoherent with the rest of the
network. Such chimera-type patterns with an incoherent state formed by a single
oscillator were observed in various oscillator networks; however, there is
still a lack of understanding of how such states can stably appear. Here, we
study the stability of solitary states in Kuramoto networks of identical
two-dimensional phase oscillators with inertia and a phase-lagged coupling. The
presence of inertia can induce rotatory dynamics of the phase difference
between the solitary oscillator and the coherent cluster. We derive asymptotic
stability conditions for such a solitary state as a function of inertia,
network size, and phase lag that may yield either attractive or repulsive
coupling. Counterintuitively, our analysis demonstrates that (i) increasing the
size of the coherent cluster can promote the stability of the solitary state in
the attractive coupling case and (ii) the solitary state can be stable in
small-size networks with all repulsive coupling. We also discuss the
implications of our stability analysis for the emergence of rotatory chimeras.

communications such as 5G and 6G, the researchers continuously come up with
newer techniques to enhance the security and performance of these progressive
wireless communications. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is one of
those techniques that artificially rearrange and optimize the propagation
environment of electromagnetic waves to improve both spectrum and energy
efficiency of wireless networks. Besides, in underwater communication,
underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) is a better
alternative/replacement for conventional acoustic and radio frequency (RF)
technologies. Hence, mixed RIS-aided RF-UOWC can be treated as a promising
technology for future wireless networks. This work focuses on the secrecy
performance of mixed dual-hop RIS-aided RF-UOWC networks under the intercepting
effort of a probable eavesdropper. The RF link operates under generalized Gamma
fading distribution; likewise, the UOWC link experiences the mixture
exponential generalized Gamma distribution. The secrecy analysis subsumes the
derivations of closed-form expressions for average secrecy capacity, exact and
lower bound of secrecy outage probability, and strictly positive secrecy
capacity, all in terms of Meijer G functions. Capitalizing on these
derivations, the effects of heterodyne and intensity modulation/direct
detection systems, underwater turbulence resulting from air bubble levels,
temperature gradients, and salinity gradients, are measured. Unlike
conventional models that merely deal with thermally uniform scenarios, this
proposed model is likely to be unique in terms of dealing with secrecy analysis
of a temperature gradient RIS-aided RF-UOWC network. Lastly, the derivations
are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations.

instruments provides a massive leap forward in collecting area and therefore
raw sensitivity. However, to achieve this theoretical level of sensitivity in
the science data products we need to address the much more pernicious
systematic effects, which are the true limitation. These become all the more
significant when we consider that much of the time used by survey instruments,
such as the SKA, will be dedicated to deep surveys.
  CHILES is a deep HI survey of the COSMOS field, with 1,000 hours of VLA time.
We present our approach for creating the image cubes from the first Epoch, with
discussions of the methods and quantification of the data quality from 946 to
1420MHz -- a redshift range of 0.5 to 0. We layout the problems we had to solve
and describe how we tackled them. These are of importance as CHILES is the
first deep wideband multi-epoch HI survey and it has relevance for ongoing and
future surveys.
  We focus on the accumulated systematic errors in the imaging, as the goal is
to deliver a high-fidelity image that is only limited by the random thermal
errors. To understand and correct these systematic effects we ideally manage
them in the domain in which they arise, and that is predominately the
visibility domain. CHILES is a perfect test bed for many of the issues we can
expect for deep imaging with the SKA or ngVLA and we discuss the lessons we
have learned.

tackle the problem of unsupervised learning of binary hash codes for efficient
cross-modal retrieval. We proposed a novel method, dubbed Cross-Modal Info-Max
Hashing (CMIMH). First, to learn informative representations that can preserve
both intra- and inter-modal similarities, we leverage the recent advances in
estimating variational lower-bound of MI to maximize the MI between the binary
representations and input features and between binary representations of
different modalities. By jointly maximizing these MIs under the assumption that
the binary representations are modelled by multivariate Bernoulli
distributions, we can learn binary representations, which can preserve both
intra- and inter-modal similarities, effectively in a mini-batch manner with
gradient descent. Furthermore, we find out that trying to minimize the modality
gap by learning similar binary representations for the same instance from
different modalities could result in less informative representations. Hence,
balancing between reducing the modality gap and losing modality-private
information is important for the cross-modal retrieval tasks. Quantitative
evaluations on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods.

quantum correlations at the mesoscopic and macroscopic level. We begin by
summarizing the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument and the Bell
correlations that cannot be explained by local hidden variable theories. It was
originally an open question as to whether (and how) such quantum correlations
could occur on a macroscopic scale, since this would seem to counter the
correspondence principle. The purpose of this review is to examine how this
question has been answered over the decades since the original papers of EPR
and Bell. We first review work relating to higher spin measurements which
revealed that macroscopic quantum states could exhibit Bell correlations. This
covers higher dimensional, multi-particle and continuous-variable EPR and Bell
states where measurements on a single system give a spectrum of outcomes, and
also multipartite states where measurements are made at multiple separated
sites. It appeared that the macroscopic quantum observations were for an
increasingly limited span of measurement settings and required a fine
resolution of outcomes. Motivated by this, we next review correlations for
macroscopic superposition states, and examine predictions for the violation of
Leggett-Garg inequalities for dynamical quantum systems. These results reveal
Bell correlations for coarse-grained measurements which need only distinguish
between macroscopically distinct states, thus bringing into question the
validity of certain forms of macroscopic realism. Finally, we review progress
for massive systems, including Bose-Einstein condensates and optomechanical
oscillators, where EPR-type correlations have been observed between massive
systems. Experiments are summarized, which support the predictions of quantum
mechanics in mesoscopic regimes.

a remarkable pairing phenomenon: If the interaction between electrons in this
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian superconductor is attractive then the
interaction between holes (i.e. missing electrons) is repulsive and vice versa.
This difference in the sign of the interactions gives rise to negative cross
correlations. Here, we propose how such electron-electron interaction can occur
due to spatiotemporal modulation of the material. We also discuss the
observability of this signature in multi-band systems.

form games (MONFGs), i.e., normal form games with vectorial payoffs. Taking a
utility-based approach, we assume that each player's utility can be modelled
with a utility function that maps a vector to a scalar utility. In the case of
a mixed strategy, it is meaningful to apply such a scalarisation both before
calculating the expectation of the payoff vector as well as after. This
distinction leads to two optimisation criteria. With the first criterion,
players aim to optimise the expected value of their utility function applied to
the payoff vectors obtained in the game. With the second criterion, players aim
to optimise the utility of expected payoff vectors given a joint strategy.
Under this latter criterion, it was shown that Nash equilibria need not exist.
Our first contribution is to provide a sufficient condition under which Nash
equilibria are guaranteed to exist. Secondly, we show that when Nash equilibria
do exist under both criteria, no equilibrium needs to be shared between the two
criteria, and even the number of equilibria can differ. Thirdly, we contribute
a study of pure strategy Nash equilibria under both criteria. We show that when
assuming quasiconvex utility functions for players, the sets of pure strategy
Nash equilibria under both optimisation criteria are equivalent. This result is
further extended to games in which players adhere to different optimisation
criteria. Finally, given these theoretical results, we construct an algorithm
to compute all pure strategy Nash equilibria in MONFGs where players have a
quasiconvex utility function.

Taylor on the turbulent dispersion of aerosols is
exactly one century old and provides an original way of introducing both
diffusive processes and turbulence at an undergraduate level. Light enough
particles transported by a turbulent flow exhibit a Brownian-like motion over
time scales larger than the velocity correlation time. Aerosols are therefore
subjected to an effective turbulent diffusion at large length scales. However,
the case of a source of pollutant much smaller than the integral scale is not
completely understood. Here, we present experimental results obtained by
undergraduate students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dispersion
of a smoke of oil droplets by a turbulent flow is studied in a wind tunnel
designed for pedagogical purposes. It shows a ballistic-like regime at short
distance, followed by Taylor's diffusive-like regime, suggesting that the
continuous cascade is bypassed. Accordingly, measurements show that the CO$_2$
concentration emitted when breathing typically decays as the inverse squared
distance to the mouth, which is not the law expected for a diffusion. The
experiment offers the possibility for students to understand the role of
fluctuations in diffusive processes and in turbulence. The non-linear diffusive
equations governing aerosol dispersion, based on a single correlation time,
allow us to model the airborne transmission risk of pathogens, indoors and
outdoors. We discuss the pedagogical interest of making students work on
applied scientific problems, as the results obtained in this study have been
used to provide public health policy recommendations to prevent transmission in
French shopping malls.

extensive experimental findings. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training
strategy for training DGL-GAN, which can largely stabilize its training process
and achieve superior performance when we apply DGL-GAN to compress the two most

Experiments show that DGL-GAN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on both
StyleGAN2 (FID 2.92 on FFHQ with nearly $1/3$ parameters of StyleGAN2) and
BigGAN (IS 93.29 and FID 9.92 on ImageNet with nearly $1/4$ parameters of
BigGAN) and also outperforms several existing vanilla GAN compression
techniques. Moreover, DGL-GAN is also effective in boosting the performance of
original uncompressed GANs, original uncompressed StyleGAN2 boosted with
DGL-GAN achieves FID 2.65 on FFHQ, which achieves a new state-of-the-art
performance. Code and models are available at

mobility, not much is known about how HSR affects the flow of well-educated

on large-scale resume data of online job seekers and explore how it is affected
by HSR. Specifically, we employ both a multiple linear regression model that
controls for several socioeconomic factors and a two-stage least square
regression model that instruments the introduction of HSR to a city to address
endogeneity concerns. We find that the introduction of HSR has an overall
positive effect on the talent net inflow of a city although both inflow and
outflow are increased. Moreover, the effects of HSR on talent flow are rather
heterogeneous for cities with different levels of economic development and for
talents working in different industries. Specifically, developed cities benefit
from HSR, whereas less-developed cities are relatively impaired. Cities
connected by HSR show significant advantage in attracting talents from
secondary and tertiary industries. These substantial but heterogeneous effects
of HSR suggest a critical need for more comprehensive thinking about the
long-term benefits of entering the HSR network, especially for less-developed
cities and those with comparative advantage in manufacturing and service

research topic of growing popularity in the last few years. Being able to
learn, adapt, and generalize continually in an efficient, effective, and
scalable way is fundamental for a sustainable development of Artificial
Intelligent systems. However, an agent-centric view of continual learning
requires learning directly from raw data, which limits the interaction between
independent agents, the efficiency, and the privacy of current approaches.
Instead, we argue that continual learning systems should exploit the
availability of compressed information in the form of trained models. In this
paper, we introduce and formalize a new paradigm named ""Ex-Model Continual
Learning"" (ExML), where an agent learns from a sequence of previously trained
models instead of raw data. We further contribute with three ex-model continual
learning algorithms and an empirical setting comprising three datasets (MNIST,
CIFAR-10 and CORe50), and eight scenarios, where the proposed algorithms are
extensively tested. Finally, we highlight the peculiarities of the ex-model
paradigm and we point out interesting future research directions.

other via a real singlet scalar field by a modelled Yukawa interactions is
studied to explore the extent of dynamical mass generation and the field
propagators in the model at different cutoff values. The model is studied for
various renormalized masses of the second Higgs field at various coupling

$125.09$ GeV. The model has strong indications of existence of critical

generally within $200$ MeV. The two Higgs propagators are found to be
considerably stable compared to scalar singlet propagators despite cutoff
effects. No phase structure in the parameter space was observed. The model is a
non-trivial theory in scalar sector.

the soliton is wider by a factor of 3, following the inverse scaling required

apparent horizons. We review properties of the near-horizon geometry
emphasizing the consequences of two common implicit assumptions of
semiclassical physics. The first is a consequence of the cosmic censorship
conjecture, namely that curvature scalars are finite at apparent horizons. The
second is that horizons form in finite asymptotic time (i.e. according to
distant observers), a property implicitly assumed in conventional descriptions
of black hole formation and evaporation. Taking these as the only requirements
within the semiclassical framework, we find that in spherical symmetry only two
classes of dynamic solutions are admissible, both describing evaporating black
holes and expanding white holes. We review their properties and present the
implications. The null energy condition is violated in the vicinity of the
outer horizon and satisfied in the vicinity of the inner apparent/anti-trapping
horizon. Apparent and anti-trapping horizons are timelike surfaces of
intermediately singular behavior, which manifests itself in negative energy
density firewalls. These and other properties are also present in axially
symmetric solutions. Different generalizations of surface gravity to dynamic
spacetimes are discordant and do not match the semiclassical results. We
conclude by discussing signatures of these models and implications for the

smoking-gun evidence for deconfined spinons in any QSL candidate so far. The
disorders and competing exchange interactions may prevent the formation of an

thermal conductivity. Thus, we propose a scenario of fluctuating ferrimagnetic

angular resolution is relatively lower than that of a narrow field-of-view
(FOV) perspective image as it is captured by using fisheye lenses with the same
sensor size. Therefore, it is beneficial to super-resolve a 360{\deg}image.
Some attempts have been made but mostly considered the equirectangular
projection (ERP) as one of the way for 360{\deg}image representation despite of
latitude-dependent distortions. In that case, as the output high-resolution(HR)
image is always in the same ERP format as the low-resolution (LR) input,
another information loss may occur when transforming the HR image to other
projection types. In this paper, we propose SphereSR, a novel framework to
generate a continuous spherical image representation from an LR 360{\deg}image,
aiming at predicting the RGB values at given spherical coordinates for
super-resolution with an arbitrary 360{\deg}image projection. Specifically, we
first propose a feature extraction module that represents the spherical data
based on icosahedron and efficiently extracts features on the spherical
surface. We then propose a spherical local implicit image function (SLIIF) to
predict RGB values at the spherical coordinates. As such, SphereSR flexibly
reconstructs an HR image under an arbitrary projection type. Experiments on
various benchmark datasets show that our method significantly surpasses

that for the classic case of channel flow, the growth of turbulent stripes is

embedding network. This design is problematic because the classifier needs to
adapt quickly to new tasks while the embedding does not. To overcome this

two GNNs, an instance GNN and a prototype GNN. Instead of label propagation,
they act as feature embedding adaptation modules for quick adaptation of the
meta-learned feature embedding to new tasks. Importantly they are designed to
deal with a fundamental yet often neglected challenge in FSL, that is, with
only a handful of shots per class, any few-shot classifier would be sensitive

freely cooling granular gas made up of smooth inelastic hard spheres. In
general, intruders and particles of the granular gas are assumed to have
different mechanical properties, implying that non-equipartition of energy must
be accounted for in the computation of the diffusion coefficient $D$. In the
hydrodynamic regime, the time decay of the granular temperature $T$ of the
cooling granular gas is known to be dictated by Haff's law; the corresponding
decay of the intruder's collision frequency entails a time decrease of the
diffusion coefficient $D$. Explicit knowledge of this time dependence allows us
to determine the MSD by integrating the corresponding diffusion equation. As in
previous studies of self-diffusion (intruders mechanically equivalent to gas
particles) and the Brownian limit (intruder's mass much larger than the grain's
mass), we find a logarithmic time dependence of the MSD as a consequence of
Haff's law. Beyond the logarithmic time growth, we find that the MSD depends on
the mechanical system parameters in a highly complex way. To explain the
observed behaviour, we analyze in detail the intruder's random walk, consisting
of ballistic displacements interrupted by anisotropic deflections caused by the
collisions with the hard spheres. We also show that the MSD can be thought of
as arising from an equivalent random walk with isotropic, uncorrelated steps.

the smallest number of linearly-dependent columns of the matrix, influences the
effectiveness of PPR. We formulate a spark optimization problem and obtain code

interventions in the first stages of a pandemic. Among these, lockdown policies
proved unavoidable yet extremely costly from an economic perspective. To better
understand the tradeoffs between economic and epidemic costs of lockdown
interventions, we here focus on a simple SIR epidemic model and study lockdowns
as solutions to an optimal control problem. We first show numerically that the
optimal lockdown policy exhibits a phase transition from suppression to
mitigation as the time horizon grows, i.e., if the horizon is short the optimal
strategy is to impose severe lockdown to avoid diffusion of the infection,
whereas if the horizon is long the optimal control steers the system to herd
immunity to reduce economic loss. We then consider two alternative policies,
motivated by government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, where lockdown
levels are selected to either stabilize the reproduction number (i.e., ""flatten
the curve"") or the fraction of infected (i.e., containing the number of
hospitalizations). We compute analytically the performance of these two
feedback policies and compare them to the optimal control. Interestingly, we
show that in the limit of infinite horizon stabilizing the number of infected
is preferable to controlling the reproduction number, and in fact yields close
to optimal performance.

a topological analysis of the minimal spanning trees calculated based on this
matrix are applied for different positions of a moving window. The
cryptocurrencies become more strongly cross-correlated among themselves than
they used to be before. The average cross-correlations increase with time on a
specific time scale in a way that resembles the Epps effect amplification when
going from past to present. The minimal spanning trees also change their
topology and, for the short time scales, they become more centralized with
increasing maximum node degrees, while for the long time scales they become
more distributed, but also more correlated at the same time. Apart from the
inter-market dependencies, the detrended cross-correlations between the
cryptocurrency market and some traditional markets, like the stock markets,
commodity markets, and Forex, are also analyzed. The cryptocurrency market
shows higher levels of cross-correlations with the other markets during the
same turbulent periods, in which it is strongly cross-correlated itself.

galaxies with stellar mass Mstar > 10^9 Mo in the EAGK simulation over the
redshift range z=[0, 2.5]. We find that the median metallicity gradient of the
simulated galaxies is close to zero at all z, whereas the scatter around the
median increases with z. The metallicity gradients of individual galaxies can
evolve from strong to weak and vice-versa, since mostly low-metallicity gas
accretes onto the galaxy, resulting in enhanced star formation and ejection of
metal enriched gas by energy feedback. Such episodes of enhanced accretion,
mainly dominated by major mergers, are more common at higher z, and hence
contribute to increasing the diversity of gradients. For galaxies with negative
metallicity gradients, we find a redshift evolution of ~ -0.03 dex/kpc/\delta
z$. A positive mass dependence is found at z< 0.5, which becomes slightly
stronger for higher redshifts and, mainly, for Mstar < 10^9.5 Mo. Only galaxies
with negative metallicity gradients define a correlation with galaxy size,
consistent with an inside-out formation scenario. Our findings suggest that
major mergers and/or significant gas accretion can drive strong negative or
positive metallicity gradients. The first ones are preferentially associated
with disc-dominated galaxies, and the second ones with dispersion-dominated
systems. The comparison with forthcoming observations at high redshift will
allow a better understanding of the potential role of metallicity gradients as
a chemical probe of galaxy formation.

from the noisy pairwise measurements. Such a nonconvex problem has received
much attention from numerous scientific fields including computer vision,
robotics, and cryo-electron microscopy. In this paper, we focus on the
orthogonal group synchronization problem with general additive noise models
under incomplete measurements, which is much more general than the commonly
considered setting of complete measurements. Characterizations of the
orthogonal group synchronization problem are given from perspectives of
optimality conditions as well as fixed points of the projected gradient ascent
method which is also known as the generalized power method (GPM). It is well
worth noting that these results still hold even without generative models. In
the meantime, we derive the local error bound property for the orthogonal group
synchronization problem which is useful for the convergence rate analysis of
different algorithms and can be of independent interest. Finally, we prove the
linear convergence result of the GPM to a global maximizer under a general
additive noise model based on the established local error bound property. Our
theoretical convergence result holds under several deterministic conditions
which can cover certain cases with adversarial noise, and as an example we
specialize it to the setting of the Erd\""os-R\'enyi measurement graph and
Gaussian noise.

visual content and reading the text of images to generate a natural language
description. Although a task can teach machines to understand the complex human
environment further given that text is omnipresent in our daily surroundings,
it poses additional challenges in normal captioning. A text-based image
intuitively contains abundant and complex multimodal relational content, that
is, image details can be described diversely from multiview rather than a
single caption. Certainly, we can introduce additional paired training data to
show the diversity of images' descriptions, this process is labor-intensive and
time-consuming for TextCap pair annotations with extra texts. Based on the

multimodal relational graphs of images and model complex relationships among
graphs to represent descriptive diversity. Moreover, a cascaded generative
adversarial network is developed from modeled graphs to infer the unpaired
caption generation in image-sentence feature alignment and linguistic coherence
levels. We validate the effectiveness of MAGIC in generating diverse captions
from different relational information items of an image. Experimental results
show that MAGIC can generate very promising outcomes without using any

of its relationship to other broad-line region (BLR) lines. The self-shielding,
stratified, BLR model of Gaskell, Klimek & Nazarova (2007; GKN) predicts that
Fe II emission comes from twice the radius of H$\beta$, in agreement with
widths of lines of Fe II lines being only 70% of the widths of H$\beta$. This
disagrees with some reverberation mapping results which have suggested that Fe
II and H$\beta$ arise at similar radii. The highest quality reverberation
mapping, however, supports the predictions that Fe II comes from twice the
radius of H$\beta$. We suggest that lower quality reverberation mapping of Fe
II is biased to give too small lags. We conclude that, in agreement with the
GKN model, the region emitting Fe II is the outermost part of the BLR just
inside the surrounding dust. The model naturally gives the Doppler broadening
require by models of Fe II emission. Optical Fe II emission implies typical
reddenings of E(B-V) ~ 0.20. This helps explain the ratio of UV to optical Fe
II emission. Simulations show that the amplitude of Fe II variability is
consistent with being the same as for H$\beta$ variability. The FeII/H$\beta$
ratio is a good proxy for the Eddington ratio. The ratio might be driven in
part by the strong soft X-ray excess because the X-rays destroy grains and
release iron into the gas phase. We propose that the correlation of Fe II
strength with radio and host galaxy properties is a result of AGN downsizing.

low-mass galaxies of $M_* \lesssim 10^9 M_\odot$, we find a dependence of
decreasing HI-to-optical disk size ratio with increasing $S_{sum}$, but no
dependence of HI spectral line asymmetry with $S_{sum}$. This is consistent
with the behavior expected under tidal stripping. We confirm that the color
profile shape and color gradient depend on the stellar mass, but there is
additional correlation of low-mass galaxies having their color gradients within
$2R_{50}$ increasing with higher $S_{sum}$. For these low-mass galaxies, the
dependence of color gradients on $S_{sum}$ is driven by color becoming
progressively redder in the inner disk when tidal perturbations are stronger.
For high-mass galaxies, there is no dependence of color gradients on $S_{sum}$,
and we find a marginal reddening throughout the disks with increasing
$S_{sum}$. Our result highlights tidal interaction as an important

KGs can be biased either directly due to the underlying data sources that are

always opposite the larger angle in any triangle. However, directly applying
such information on the input image is ineffective because it cannot thoroughly
explore the neighborhood of the input sample in the high dimensional space. To
address this issue, TA optimizes the perturbation in the low frequency space
for effective dimensionality reduction owing to the generality of such
geometric property. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet dataset show that TA
achieves a much higher attack success rate within 1,000 queries and needs a
much less number of queries to achieve the same attack success rate under
various perturbation budgets than existing decision-based attacks. With such
high efficiency, we further validate the applicability of TA on real-world API,
i.e., Tencent Cloud API.

the thermalisation of some isolated quantum systems, starting from certain
initial states. One of the first models to show this was the so-called PXP
Hamiltonian, which was used to theoretically model an experiment on a chain of
strongly interacting Rydberg atoms. A defining feature of the PXP Hamiltonian
is a set of dynamical constraints that make certain states inaccessible to the
dynamics. In this paper we construct a class of spin chain models that are
parameterised by a discrete variable $\ell$ that controls the ""strength"" of a
dynamical constraint. We show that by increasing $\ell$ the constraint becomes
weaker, in the sense that fewer states are excluded from the dynamics. The PXP
Hamiltonian is special case for $\ell = 2$. By weakening the constraint to
$\ell \geq 4$, however, we find a more extreme version of quantum scarring than
in the PXP Hamiltonian, with the number of scar states growing exponentially in
the system size.

as the trial progresses. Platform trials are more efficient than independent
parallel-group trials because of using shared control groups. For arms entering
the trial later, not all patients in the control group are randomised
concurrently. The control group is then divided into concurrent and
non-concurrent controls. Using non-concurrent controls (NCC) can improve the
trial's efficiency, but can introduce bias due to time trends. We focus on a
platform trial with two treatment arms and a common control arm. Assuming that
the second treatment arm is added later, we assess the robustness of
model-based approaches to adjust for time trends when using NCC. We consider
approaches where time trends are modeled as linear or as a step function, with
steps at times where arms enter or leave the trial. For trials with continuous
or binary outcomes, we investigate the type 1 error (t1e) rate and power of
testing the efficacy of the newly added arm under a range of scenarios. In
addition to scenarios where time trends are equal across arms, we investigate
settings with trends that are different or not additive in the model scale. A
step function model fitted on data from all arms gives increased power while
controlling the t1e, as long as the time trends are equal for the different
arms and additive on the model scale. This holds even if the trend's shape
deviates from a step function if block randomisation is used. But if trends
differ between arms or are not additive on the model scale, t1e control may be
lost. The efficiency gained by using step function models to incorporate NCC
can outweigh potential biases. However, the specifics of the trial,
plausibility of different time trends, and robustness of results should be
considered

formulation of the polling system as to introduce additional modelling power.
Such power comes at the expense of truncation errors and expensive numerical
integrals which naturally leads to the question of whether the SMDP policy
provides a worthwhile advantage. To further add to this scenario, it is shown
how sparsity can be exploited in the CTMDP to develop a computationally
efficient model. The discounted performance of the SMDP and CTMDP policies are
evaluated using a Semi-Markov Process simulator. The two policies are
accompanied by a heuristic policy specifically developed for this polling

model of explainable $k$-means and $k$-median clustering. In this model, a
decision tree with $k$ leaves provides a straightforward characterization of
the data set into clusters.
  We study two natural algorithmic questions about explainable clustering. (1)
For a given clustering, how to find the ""best explanation"" by using a decision
tree with $k$ leaves? (2) For a given set of points, how to find a decision
tree with $k$ leaves minimizing the $k$-means/median objective of the resulting
explainable clustering? To address the first question, we introduce a new model
of explainable clustering. Our model, inspired by the notion of outliers in
robust statistics, is the following. We are seeking a small number of points
(outliers) whose removal makes the existing clustering well-explainable. For
addressing the second question, we initiate the study of the model of
Moshkovitz et al. from the perspective of multivariate complexity. Our rigorous
algorithmic analysis sheds some light on the influence of parameters like the
input size, dimension of the data, the number of outliers, the number of

The goal of our work was to reduce the number of annotated images needed to

performance of a CNN can be improved faster by ensuring that the set of
training images contains a large fraction of hard-to-classify images. The
objective of our study was to test this hypothesis with an active learning
method that can automatically select the hard-to-classify images. We developed
an active learning method for Mask Region-based CNN (Mask R-CNN) and named this
method MaskAL. MaskAL involved the iterative training of Mask R-CNN, after
which the trained model was used to select a set of unlabelled images about
which the model was most uncertain. The selected images were then annotated and
used to retrain Mask R-CNN, and this was repeated for a number of sampling
iterations. In our study, MaskAL was compared to a random sampling method on a
broccoli dataset with five visually similar classes. MaskAL performed
significantly better than the random sampling. In addition, MaskAL had the same
performance after sampling 900 images as the random sampling had after 2300
images. Compared to a Mask R-CNN model that was trained on the entire training
set (14,000 images), MaskAL achieved 93.9% of that model's performance with
17.9% of its training data. The random sampling achieved 81.9% of that model's

and data scientists, aiming to equip them with an overarching framework of
quantum computing, the basic language and building blocks of quantum
algorithms, and an overview of existing quantum applications in statistics and
data analysis. Our goal is to enable statisticians and data scientists to
follow quantum computing literature relevant to their fields, to collaborate
with quantum algorithm designers, and, ultimately, to bring forth the next
generation of statistical and data analytics tools.

  epidemics in networks","11 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, we discuss the impacts of assortative mixing by mask-wearing
on the effectiveness of mask use in suppressing the propagation of epidemics.
We employ the mask model, which is an epidemic model involving mask wearers and
non-mask wearers. We derive the occurrence probability and mean size of large
outbreaks, epidemic threshold, and average epidemic size for the mask model in
an assortatively mixed random network that follows an arbitrary degree
distribution. Applying our analysis to the Poisson random networks, we find
that the assortative (disassortative) mixing by mask-wearing decreases
(increases) the epidemic threshold. Assortative mixing, the tendency for
(non-)mask wearers to prefer to connect with (non-)mask wearers, is not
effective in containing epidemics in that the transmissibility required for
large outbreaks to occur is small. On the other hand, in high-transmissibility
cases, mask use is most effective in decreasing the occurrence probability and
mean size of large outbreaks, as well as the average epidemic size, when the
mixing pattern is strongly assortative. Strongly assortative mixing, resulting
in the separation of mask wearers and non-mask wearers, reduces the probability
and degree of a large outbreak in high-transmissibility cases, although it
allows a large outbreak to occur even in low-transmissibility cases. In
scale-free networks, mask use is most effective when the mixing pattern is
strongly assortative and when it is maximally disassortative, provided that the
mask coverage is not low. Both for the Poisson random and scale-free networks,
all analytical treatments are in good agreement with simulation results.

significant evolution, resulting in a population of viruses that harbor
multiple haplotypes. The task of reconstructing these haplotypes from
short-read sequencing data is called viral quasispecies assembly, and it can be
categorized as a multiassembly problem. We consider the de novo version of the
problem, where no reference is available.
  We present ViQUF, a de novo viral quasispecies assembler that addresses
haplotype assembly and quantification. ViQUF obtains a first draft of the
assembly graph from a de Bruijn graph. Then, solving a min-cost flow over a
flow network built for each pair of adjacent vertices based on their paired-end
information creates an approximate paired assembly graph with suggested
frequency values as edge labels, which is the first frequency estimation. Then,
original haplotypes are obtained through a greedy path reconstruction guided by
a min-cost flow solution in the approximate paired assembly graph. ViQUF
outputs the contigs with their frequency estimations. Results on real and
simulated data show that ViQUF is at least four times faster using at most half
of the memory than previous methods, while maintaining, and in some cases
outperforming, the high quality of assembly and frequency estimation of overlap
graph-based methodologies, which are known to be more accurate but slower than
the de Bruijn graph-based approaches.

underlying face recognition algorithms. Face image quality assessment (FIQA)
estimates the utility of the captured image in achieving reliable and accurate
recognition performance. In this work, we propose a novel learning paradigm
that learns internal network observations during the training process. Based on
that, our proposed CR-FIQA uses this paradigm to estimate the face image
quality of a sample by predicting its relative classifiability. This
classifiability is measured based on the allocation of the training sample
feature representation in angular space with respect to its class center and
the nearest negative class center. We experimentally illustrate the correlation
between the face image quality and the sample relative classifiability. As such
property is only observable for the training dataset, we propose to learn this
property from the training dataset and utilize it to predict the quality
measure on unseen samples. This training is performed simultaneously while
optimizing the class centers by an angular margin penalty-based softmax loss
used for face recognition model training. Through extensive evaluation
experiments on eight benchmarks and four face recognition models, we
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CR-FIQA over state-of-the-art

RISs are deployed to assist the communication between multiple access points
(APs) and multiple users, with either continuous or discrete phase shifts at
the RISs. We formulate the max-min fairness problem that maximizes the minimum
achievable rate among all users by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming
at active APs and the phase shifts at passive RISs, subject to power
constraints at the APs. To address such a challenging problem, we first study
the special single-user scenario and propose an algorithm that can transform
the optimization problem into semidefinite program (SDP) or integer linear
program (ILP) for the cases of continuous and discrete phase shifts,
respectively. By solving the resulting SDP and ILP, we first obtain the optimal
phase shifts, and then design the optimal transmit beamforming accordingly. To
solve the optimization problem for the multi-user scenario and continuous phase
shifts at RISs, we extend the single-user algorithm and propose an alternating
optimization algorithm, which can first decompose the max-min fairness problem
into two subproblems related to transmit beamforming and phase shifts, and then
transform the two subproblems into second-order-cone program and SDP,
respectively. For the multi-user scenario and discrete phase shifts, the
max-min fairness problem is shown to be a mixed-integer non-linear program
(MINLP). To tackle it, we design a ZF-based successive refinement algorithm,
which can find a suboptimal transmit beamforming and phase shifts by means of
alternating optimization. Numerical results show that compared with benchmark
schemes of random phase shifts and without using RISs, the proposed algorithms
can significantly increase the minimum achievable rate among all users,
especially when the number of reflecting elements at each RIS is large.

self-tests a quantum state, rather a non-maximal nonlocal behavior can serve
the same purpose. We, in fact, completely characterize all such behaviors

Specifically, our network takes the semantic layout features from the input
scene image, features encoded from the edges and silhouette in the input object
patch, as well as a latent code as inputs, and generates a 2D spatial affine
transform defining the translation and scaling of the object patch. The learned

transform the object patch into the target image, where our model is trained
adversarially using an affine transform discriminator and a layout

  Let us underline that, as opposed to prior works, in case of vacuum, our

promising candidates for thermoelectric applications due to its intrinsically

enhancement of the thermoelectric performance by single doping at Bi site is
limited mainly due to dramatic decrease of carrier mobility. Thus, new
strategies, such as dual doping or doping with variable-valence elements seem
to be promising. Along with that, the development of a fast and scalable
synthesis route is essential for the industrial-scale fabrication of
thermoelectric materials. Hence, in this paper, Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_{x}$CuSeO samples
(0 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 0.08) have been synthesized with a simple and scalable

the muon flux according to the localization and to the atmospheric conditions.
Two approaches are commonly used: either through semi-empirical models
calibrated on existing data or via Monte-Carlo simulations. The former requires
extrapolations to the field experiment conditions while the latter offers the
advantage of tackling down in an unique way all relevant parameters such as
barometric conditions, geomagnetic field, atmosphere density etc. Although
significant progress were made in the last decades, precision muography
experiments require more and more accuracy on the models, especially for the
muons close to the horizon where large disparities still remain. In this paper

is related to the increase in the number of authors per paper and the emergence
of interdisciplinary works featuring specialists of different fields. In such a
environment, it is not trivial to quantify the individual impact of
researchers. Here we analyze how the most prolific collaboration tie (in terms
of co-produced works) of an established researcher influences their
productivity and visibility metrics. In particular, we check how the number of
produced works, citations and h-index rank of an researcher changes when their
works also coauthored by their prolific collaborators are not considered. We
observed different patterns of prolific collaborator influence across the major
fields of knowledge. More specifically, in formal and applied sciences, the
prolific collaborators seem to play an important role to the visibility metrics
of authors even when they are among the highly cited. Such a results can help
stakeholders to better understand the collaboration patterns and draw measures
of success that also consider collaboration ties.

engage in and enjoy effortful thinking is referred to as a person's 'need for
cognition.' In this article we study the relationship between software
engineers' personality traits and their need for cognition. Through a
large-scale sample study of 483 respondents we collected data to capture the
six 'bright' personality traits of the HEXACO model of personality, and three
`dark' personality traits. Data were analyzed using several methods including a
multiple Bayesian linear regression analysis. The results indicate that ca. 33%
of variation in developers' need for cognition can be explained by personality
traits. The Bayesian analysis suggests four traits to be of particular interest
in predicting need for cognition: openness to experience, conscientiousness,
honesty-humility, and emotionality. Further, we also find that need for
cognition of software engineers is, on average, higher than in the general
population, based on a comparison with prior studies. Given the importance of
human factors for software engineers' performance in general, and problem
solving skills in particular, our findings suggest several implications for

crucial precondition to understand the ability of the immune system to

complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of their respective T-cell receptor
beta chains. Nevertheless, previous studies often simply compared if CDR3beta
sequences were equal, while network theory studies were usually limited to
several thousand sequences due to the high computational effort of constructing
the network. To overcome that hurdle, we introduce the GPU-based algorithm
TCR-NET to construct large-scale CDR3beta similarity networks using
model-generated and empirical sequence data with up to 800,000 CDR3beta
sequences on a normal computer for the first time. Using network analysis
methods we study the structural properties of these networks and conclude that
(i) the fraction of public TCRs depends on the size of the TCR repertoire,
along with the exact (not unified) definition of ""public"" sequences, (ii) the
TCR network is assortative with the average neighbor degree being proportional
to the squareroot of the degree of a node and (iii) the repertoire is robust
against losses of TCRs. Moreover, we analyze the networks of antigen-specific
TCRs for different antigen families and find differing clustering coefficients
and assortativities. TCR-NET offers better access to assess large-scale TCR
repertoire networks, opening the possibility to quantify their structure and
quantitatively distinguish their ability to react to antigens, which we
anticipate to become a useful tool in a time of increasingly large amounts of
repertoire sequencing data becoming available.

the improvements of a radon detector by installing a new PIN-photodiode

of PIN-photodiodes. As a result of the calibrations, we found an improvement of
$(3.8\pm2.4)\%$ in the detection efficiencies below $1.0$ $\mathrm{g/m^{3}}$,
while a $10$-$20\%$ improvement occurred above this level. The intrinsic

as $0.24^{+0.09}_{-0.05}$ $\mathrm{mBq/m^{3}}$. This background level is
consistent with the radon detector with the small PIN-photodiode, although we

compare with the prediction of the Stokes-Einstein theory. Two main set-ups are

eventually producing merger events. Approximately half of the systems exhibit
orbital period modulations, as a result of mass transfer or mass loss
processes. Although they are in contact, their fill-out factor is low (less
than 30 per cent), while their mass ratio is larger than the one in longer
period contact binaries. The present study investigates the orbital stability
of these systems and examines their physical and orbital parameters in
comparison to those of the entire sample of known and well-studied contact

that ultra-short orbital period contact binaries have very stable orbits, while
very often additional components are gravitationally bound in wide orbits
around the central binary system. We confirmed that the evolution of such

extensively investigated to mitigate the adverse effects of domain gaps. Those
works assume the target domain data can be accessible all at once. However, for
the real-world streaming data, this hinders the timely adaptation to changing
data statistics and sufficient exploitation of increasing samples. In this
paper, to address more practical scenarios, we propose a new task, Lifelong
Unsupervised Domain Adaptive (LUDA) person ReID. This is challenging because it
requires the model to continuously adapt to unlabeled data in the target
environments while alleviating catastrophic forgetting for such a fine-grained
person retrieval task. We design an effective scheme for this task, dubbed
CLUDA-ReID, where the anti-forgetting is harmoniously coordinated with the
adaptation. Specifically, a meta-based Coordinated Data Replay strategy is
proposed to replay old data and update the network with a coordinated
optimization direction for both adaptation and memorization. Moreover, we
propose Relational Consistency Learning for old knowledge
distillation/inheritance in line with the objective of retrieval-based tasks.
We set up two evaluation settings to simulate the practical application
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
CLUDA-ReID for both scenarios with stationary target streams and scenarios with
dynamic target streams.

avoiding the conservation of the total energy-momentum tensor has been already
introduced in the literature, it has been not widely explored so far. We study
an expanding universe sourced by a single effective perfect fluid such that the
null divergence of its energy-momentum tensor is not imposed. As we shall show,
in this scheme, the unimodular theory has its own conservation equation
obtained from the Bianchi identities. We explore the evolution of the
homogeneous and isotropic expanding background and show that a viable
cosmological scenario exists. Also, we consider scalar perturbations with
particular attention given to the gauge issue. We show that contrary to the
traditional unimodular theory where the synchronous and longitudinal
(newtonian) gauge for cosmological perturbations are not permitted, if the
conservation of the energy-momentum is relaxed the scalar perturbations in the
synchronous condition survive and present a growing mode behavior. We study
therefore a new cosmological scenario in which the dynamics of the universe
transits from the radiative phase directly to a accelerated one but allowing
thus for structure formation.

Dynamic classifier chains denote the idea that for each instance to classify,

complexity of a naive implementation of such an approach is prohibitive,
because it would require to train a sequence of classifiers for every possible
permutation of the labels. To tackle this problem efficiently, we propose a new
approach based on random decision trees which can dynamically select the label

the next label improves over the use of a static ordering under an otherwise

importantly, the dynamic selection strategy allows to considerably speed up

experiment, several square meters of wavelength-shifting reflectors (WLSR) were

  In this work, we first characterized the absorption (and reflectivity) of
PEN, TPB (and TTX) films in response to visible light. We then measured TPB and
PEN coupled to TTX in a LAr setup equipped with a VUV sensitive photomultiplier

transiting exoplanet atmospheres have employed a linear map between comparison

correct for systematics contaminating the transit signal. As an alternative to
this conventional method, we introduce a new Gaussian Processes (GP)
regression-based method to analyse ground-based spectrophotometric data. Our
new method allows for a generalised non-linear mapping between the target
transit light curves and the time series used to detrend them. This represents
an improvement compared to previous studies because the target and comparison
star fluxes are affected by different telluric and instrumental systematics,
which are complex and non-linear. We apply our method to six Gemini/GMOS
transits of the warm (T$_{\rm eq}$ = 990 K) Neptune HAT-P-26b. We obtain on
average $\sim$20 % better transit depth precision and residual scatter on the
white light curve compared to the conventional method when using the comparison
star light curve as a GP regressor and $\sim$20% worse when explicitly not
using the comparison star. Ultimately, with only a cost of 30% precision on the
transmission spectra, our method overcomes the necessity of using comparison
stars in the instrument field of view, which has been one of the limiting
factors for ground-based observations of the atmospheres of exoplanets
transiting bright stars. We obtain a flat transmission spectrum for HAT-P-26b
in the range of 490-900 nm that can be explained by the presence of a grey
opacity cloud deck, and indications of transit timing variations, both of which
are consistent with previous measurements.

cornerstone of our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. In particular,
random circuits act as minimally structured toy models for chaotic

thereby providing invaluable insights into questions which might be out of

present at very early epochs, which includes a totally antisymmetric torsion,
that in (3+1)-dimensions is equivalent to a pseudoscalar (Kalb-Ramond,
string-model independent) axion field. Upon condensation of primordial
gravitational waves (GW), that are created at a pre-inflationary era, the model
leads to inflation of the so-called running-vacuum-model (RVM) type, which is
realised without the need for external inflaton fields, being due to the
non-linearities that characterise the gravitational theory. The model provides
an alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, and is also capable of inducing
matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe, during the post-inflationary
radiation era, in models with right-handed neutrinos in their matter spectra.
The so-induced asymmetry is triggered by a Lorentz-symmetry-violating KR axion
background that is generated during the RVM-inflationary period, as a
consequence of the GW condensate. The modern era of this cosmology is argued to
be characterised by observable (RVM-type) deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, with
the potential of alleviating the observed tensions in the cosmological data.

often assumed to be uncorrelated in theoretical work. Correlated branches are
considered seldom since they are mathematically less tractable. For correlated
Rician fading, only the first- and second-order moments have been explored. To
describe propagation environments more accurately, full distribution functions
are needed.
  This manuscript provides these functions for the maximum ratio combining
effective channel, a quadratic form of a random complex normal channel vector.
Its mean vector and covariance matrix are based on a plane wave model
incorporating array geometry, antenna element pattern, power angular spectra
and power delay profiles. Closed-form approximations of the distribution
functions are presented, to allow the fast evaluation of many real-world
scenarios.
  The statistical framework is used to show that low-directivity antenna
elements provide better performance in angular constricted Rician fading with
off-axis incidence than high-directivity elements. Moreover, two base station
array layouts are compared, showing that a half-circle array illuminates a cell
more evenly than a uniform linear array. With the full distribution functions
available, performance can be compared over the full range of received powers
and not only based on the average SNR.

  Segmentation with Ambiguous Labels",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Despite the superior performance of Deep Learning (DL) on numerous
segmentation tasks, the DL-based approaches are notoriously overconfident about
their prediction with highly polarized label probability. This is often not
desirable for many applications with the inherent label ambiguity even in human
annotations. This challenge has been addressed by leveraging multiple
annotations per image and the segmentation uncertainty. However, multiple
per-image annotations are often not available in a real-world application and
the uncertainty does not provide full control on segmentation results to users.
In this paper, we propose novel methods to improve the segmentation probability
estimation without sacrificing performance in a real-world scenario that we
have only one ambiguous annotation per image. We marginalize the estimated
segmentation probability maps of networks that are encouraged to
under-/over-segment with the varying Tversky loss without penalizing balanced
segmentation. Moreover, we propose a unified hypernetwork ensemble method to
alleviate the computational burden of training multiple networks. Our
approaches successfully estimated the segmentation probability maps that
reflected the underlying structures and provided the intuitive control on
segmentation for the challenging 3D medical image segmentation. Although the
main focus of our proposed methods is not to improve the binary segmentation
performance, our approaches marginally outperformed the state-of-the-arts. The

strongly convex and non-convex loss functions. We then present an adaptation
framework to maximize the final model accuracy by strategically adjusting the
compression rate in each iteration. We have discussed the key implementation

  Sensing: An Empirical Study","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the field of WiFi sensing, as an alternative sensing source of the channel
state information (CSI) matrix, the use of a beamforming feedback matrix
(BFM)that is a right singular matrix of the CSI matrix has attracted
significant interest owing to its wide availability regarding the underlying
WiFi systems. In the IEEE 802.11ac/ax standard, the station (STA) transmits a
BFM to an access point (AP), which uses the BFM for precoded multiple-input and
multiple-output communications. In addition, in the same way, the AP transmits
a BFM to the STA, and the STA uses the received BFM. Regarding BFM-based
sensing, extensive real-world experiments were conducted as part of this study,
and two key insights were reported: Firstly, this report identified a potential
issue related to accuracy in existing uni-directional BFM-based sensing
frameworks that leverage only BFMs transmitted for the AP or STA. Such
uni-directionality introduces accuracy concerns when there is a sensing
capability gap between the uni-directional BFMs for the AP and STA. Thus, this
report experimentally evaluates the sensing ability disparity between the
uni-directional BFMs, and shows that the BFMs transmitted for an AP achieve
higher sensing accuracy compared to the BFMs transmitted from the STA when the
sensing target values are estimated depending on the angle of departure of the
AP. Secondly, to complement the sensing gap, this paper proposes a
bi-directional sensing framework, which simultaneously leverages the BFMs
transmitted from the AP and STA. The experimental evaluations reveal that
bi-directional sensing achieves higher accuracy than uni-directional sensing in
terms of the human localization task.

background (CMB) are required for constraining energy release scenarios at
redshifts $z\gtrsim 10^3$. The existing literature focuses on distortions that
are small perturbations to the background blackbody spectrum. At high redshifts
($z\gtrsim 10^6$), this assumption can be violated, and the CMB spectrum can be
significantly distorted at least during part of its cosmic evolution. In this
paper, we carry out accurate thermalization computations, evolving the
distorted CMB spectrum in a general, fully non-linear way, consistently
accounting for the time-dependence of the injection process, modifications to
the Hubble expansion rate and relativistic Compton scattering. Specifically, we
study single energy injection and decaying particle scenarios, discussing
constraints on these cases. We solve the thermalization problem using two
independent numerical approaches that are now available in {\tt CosmoTherm} as
dedicated setups for computing CMB spectral distortions in the large distortion
regime. New non-linear effects at low frequencies are furthermore highlighted,
showing that these warrant a more rigorous study. This work eliminates one of
the long-standing simplifications in CMB spectral distortion computations,
which also opens the way to more rigorous treatments of distortions induced by
high-energy particle cascade, soft photon injection and in the vicinity of
primordial black holes.

OQASM operations move qubits between two different bases via the quantum
Fourier transform, thus admitting important optimizations, but without inducing

enabled us to prove correct VQO's compilers -- from a simple imperative

OQASM programs using the QuickChick property-based testing framework. We have
used VQO to implement a variety of arithmetic and geometric operators that are
building blocks for important oracles, including those used in Shor's and
Grover's algorithms. We found that VQO's QFT-based arithmetic oracles require
fewer qubits, sometimes substantially fewer, than those constructed using

this case, small objects are frequently abandoned or mislabeled. In this paper,
we present an effective Dynamic Enhancement Anchor (DEA) network to construct a

interactive sample screening between an anchor-based unit and an anchor-free

recent inter-language analysis improves the capability of tracking information

the additional income gained through business expansion is the key incentive
for a decision to expand. Interestingly, companies may have this incentive but
are likely to wait for a period of time before expanding, although situations
of zero opportunity cost or specific restrictive conditions on the model

small-scale fluctuation amplitude relative to larger scales, and thus require a
significant modification of the primordial density perturbation, especially the
scalar spectral index, $n_s$. In certain promising models, $n_s$ is favored to
be larger than the $\Lambda$CDM prediction, and even the scale-invariant one,
$n_s=1$, is allowed. In this Letter, we focus on the very early Universe models
to study the implication of such unusual $n_s$. In particular, we find that an
axiverse with an axion in the equilibrium distribution during inflation can be
easily consistent with $n_s = 1$. This is because the axion behaves as a
curvaton with mass much smaller than the inflationary Hubble parameter. We also
discuss other explanations of $n_s$ different from that obtained based on the
$\Lambda$CDM.

of patterns that can be learned by the network. In this paper, we study the
storage capacity of fully-connected and sparsely-connected networks with a
binarized Hebbian rule, for arbitrary coding levels. Our results show that a
network with discrete synapses has a similar storage capacity as the model with
continuous synapses, and that this capacity tends asymptotically towards the
optimal capacity, in the space of all possible binary connectivity matrices, in
the sparse coding limit. We also derive finite coding level corrections for the
asymptotic solution in the sparse coding limit. The result indicates the
capacity of network with Hebbian learning rules converges to the optimal
capacity extremely slowly when the coding level becomes small. Our results also
show that in networks with sparse binary connectivity matrices, the information
capacity per synapse is larger than in the fully connected case, and thus such
networks store information more efficiently.

increase in size over time for drops spreading over substrates, or liquid
bridges between coalescing drops, or the decrease in the radius of pinching
necks during drop formation. Even for Newtonian fluids, the interplay of
inertial, viscous, and capillary stresses can lead to a number of scaling laws,
with three limiting self-similar cases: visco-inertial (VI), visco-capillary
(VC) and inertio-capillary (IC). Though experiments are presented as examples
of the methods of dimensional analysis, the lack of precise values or estimates
for pre-factors, transitions, and scaling exponents presents difficulties for
quantitative analysis and material characterization. In this tutorial review,
we reanalyze and summarize an elaborate set of landmark published experimental
studies on a wide range of Newtonian fluids. We show that moving beyond VI, VC,

three material properties (viscosity, surface tension and density), creates a
complementary system that we call the Ohnesorge units. We find that in spite of
large differences in topological features, timescales, and material properties,
the analysis of spreading, pinching and coalescing drops in the Ohnesorge units
results in a remarkable collapse of the experimental datasets, highlighting the

Topological classifications of either static/Floquet Hermitian or static
non-Hermitian systems based on the underlying symmetries have been well
established in the past several years. However, a coherent understanding and
classification of Floquet non-Hermitian (FNH) topological phases have not been
achieved yet. Here we systematically classify FNH topological bands for 54-fold
generalized Bernard-LeClair (GBL)symmetry classes and arbitrary spatial
dimensions using $K$-theory. The classification distinguishes two different
scenarios of the Floquet operator's spectrum gaps [dubbed as Floquet operator
(FO) angle-gapped and FO angle-gapless]. The results culminate into two
periodic tables, each containing 54-fold GBL symmetry classes. Our scheme
reveals FNH topological phases without any static/Floquet Hermitian and static
non-Hermitian counterparts. And our results naturally produce the periodic
tables of Floquet Hermitian topological insulators and Floquet unitaries. The
framework can also be applied to characterize the topological phases of bosonic
systems. We provide concrete examples of one and
two-dimensionalfermionic/bosonic systems. And we elucidate the meaning of the
topological invariants and their physical consequences. Our paper lays the

dispersed at distant galaxies. However, the physical origin of FRBs is still
unknown. Coherent curvature emission by bunches, e.g., powered by starquakes,
has already been proposed for repeating FRBs. It has the nature of
understanding narrowband radiation exhibiting time--frequency drifting.
Recently, a highly active FRB source, i.e., FRB 20201124A, was reported to
enter a newly active episode and emit at least some highly circular-polarized
bursts. In this study, we revisit the polarized FRB emission, particularly
investigating the production mechanisms of a highly circular polarization (CP)
by deriving the intrinsic mechanism and propagative effect. The intrinsic
mechanisms of invoking charged bunches are approached with radiative coherence.
Consequently, a highly CP could naturally be explained by the coherent
summation of outcome waves, generated or scattered by bunches, with different
phases and electric vectors. Different kinds of evolutionary trajectories are
found on the Poincare sphere for the bunch-coherent polarization, and this
behavior could be tested through future observations. Cyclotron resonance can
result in the absorption of R-mode photons at a low altitude region of the
magnetosphere, and an FRB should then be emitted from a high-altitude region if
the waves have strong linear polarization. Circularly polarized components
could be produced from Faraday conversion exhibiting a \lambda^3-oscillation,
but the average CP fraction depends only on the income wave, indicating a
possibility of a highly circular-polarized income wave.The analysis could be
welcome if extremely high CP from repeating FRBs is detected in the future.
Finally, the production of a bulk of energetic bunches in the pulsar-like
magnetosphere is discussed, which is relevant to the nature of the FRB central
engine.

remnants of powerful FR-II radio galaxies. In this study we make the first
attempt to perform a systematic search for RRGs of small angular sizes
($<$30$^{\prime\prime}$) in the XMM-LSS field. By using spectral curvature
criterion we discover 48 remnant candidates exhibiting strong spectral
curvature ${\it i.e.}$; ${\alpha}_{\rm 150~MHz}^{\rm 325~MHz}$ - ${\alpha}_{\rm
325~MHz}^{\rm 1.4~GHz}$ $\geq$0.5. Spectral characteristics at higher frequency
regime ($>$1.4 GHz) indicate that some of our remnant candidates can depict
recurrent AGN activity with an active core. We place an upper limit on the
remnant fraction ($f_{\rm rem}$) to be 3.9$\%$, which increases to 5.4$\%$ if
flux cutoff limit of S$_{\rm 150~MHz}$ $\geq$10 mJy is considered. Our study
unveils, hitherto unexplored, a new population of small-size ($<$200 kpc)

achieves remarkably improvements, there still exists room for further gains due
to the granularity mismatch between the masking unit of PMT (phoneme) and the
modeling unit (word-piece). To boost the performance of PMT, we propose
multi-modeling unit training (MMUT) architecture fusion with PMT (PM-MMUT). The
idea of MMUT framework is to split the Encoder into two parts including
acoustic feature sequences to phoneme-level representation (AF-to-PLR) and
phoneme-level representation to word-piece-level representation (PLR-to-WPLR).
It allows AF-to-PLR to be optimized by an intermediate phoneme-based CTC loss
to learn the rich phoneme-level context information brought by PMT.
Experimental results on Uyghur ASR show that the proposed approaches outperform
obviously the pure PMT. We also conduct experiments on the 960-hour Librispeech

this case by considering a composite system consisting of two coupled two-level

couples to the driven one. Due to the decoherence caused by environments, the

responses based on the exemplars provided by the retriever, taking advantage of
generative models and retrieval models. However, they often ignore the
retrieved exemplars while generating responses or produce responses over-fitted
to the retrieved exemplars. In this paper, we argue that these drawbacks are
derived from the one-to-many problem of the open-domain conversation. When the
retrieved exemplar is relevant to the given context yet significantly different
from the gold response, the exemplar-based generative models are trained to
ignore the exemplar since the exemplar is not helpful for generating the gold
response. On the other hand, when the retrieved exemplar is lexically similar
to the gold response, the generative models are trained to rely on the exemplar
highly. Therefore, we propose a training method selecting exemplars that are
semantically relevant to the gold response but lexically distanced from the
gold response to mitigate the above disadvantages. In the training phase, our
proposed training method first uses the gold response instead of dialogue
context as a query to select exemplars that are semantically relevant to the
gold response. And then, it eliminates the exemplars that lexically resemble
the gold responses to alleviate the dependency of the generative models on that
exemplars. The remaining exemplars could be irrelevant to the given context
since they are searched depending on the gold response. Thus, our proposed
training method further utilizes the relevance scores between the given context
and the exemplars to penalize the irrelevant exemplars. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed training method alleviates the drawbacks of the
existing exemplar-based generative models and significantly improves the
performance in terms of appropriateness and informativeness.

average Class II object does not have enough dust mass to make the cores of
giant planets. Younger Class 0/I objects have enough dust in their embedded
disk, which begs the questions: can the first steps of planet formation occur
in these younger systems? The first step is building the first planetesimals,
generally believed to be the product of the streaming instability. Hence the
question can be restated: are the physical conditions of embedded disks
conducive to the growth of the streaming instability? Here we model the
collapse of a `dusty' proto-stellar cloud to show that if there is sufficient
drift between the falling gas and dust, regions of the embedded disk can become
sufficiently enhanced in dust to drive the streaming instability. We include
four models, three with different dust grain sizes and one with a different
initial cloud angular momentum to test a variety of collapse trajectories. We
find a `sweet spot' for planetesimal formation for grain sizes of a few 10s of
micron since they fall sufficiently fast relative to the gas to build a high
dust-to-gas ratio along the disk midplane, but have slow enough radial drift
speeds in the embedded disk to maintain the high dust-to-gas ratio. Unlike the
gas, which is held in hydrostatic equilibrium for a time due to gas pressure,
the dust can begin collapsing from all radii at a much earlier time. The
streaming instability can produce at least between 7-35 M$_\oplus$ of
planetesimals in the Class 0/I phase of our smooth embedded disks, depending on
the size of the falling dust grains. This first generation of planetesimals
could represent the first step in planet formation, and occurs earlier in the
lifetime of the young star than is traditionally thought.

domains, the demand for automated understanding of visual data is higher than
ever before. Most existing machine learning models typically rely on massive
amounts of labeled training data to achieve high performance. Unfortunately,
such a requirement cannot be met in real-world applications. The number of
labels is limited and manually annotating data is expensive and time-consuming.
It is often necessary to transfer knowledge from an existing labeled domain to
a new domain. However, model performance degrades because of the differences
between domains (domain shift or dataset bias). To overcome the burden of
annotation, Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to mitigate the domain shift problem
when transferring knowledge from one domain into another similar but different
domain. Unsupervised DA (UDA) deals with a labeled source domain and an
unlabeled target domain. The principal objective of UDA is to reduce the domain
discrepancy between the labeled source data and unlabeled target data and to
learn domain-invariant representations across the two domains during training.
In this paper, we first define UDA problem. Secondly, we overview the
state-of-the-art methods for different categories of UDA from both traditional
methods and deep learning based methods. Finally, we collect frequently used

spatio-temporal models is important for decision-making as it impacts the
utilisation and interpretation of information. Bivariate mapping is commonly
used for communication of estimates and associated uncertainty; however, it is
known that different visual qualities resulting from choics of symbols and
consequent interaction between the display dimensions can lead to different
interpretations and consequently affect resultant decisions. Characteristics of
the data to be presented, such as spatial format, statistical level and
continuousness, shape the range of available bivairate symbols. The subsequent
utility of these bivariate symbols depends on their ability to achieve
end-user's goals. In this paper we present a novel design framework, which,
through consideration of both input data characteristics and potential
operational tasks (as proxy to end-user goals), assists map designers in
appropriate selection of bivariate symbols for the coincident presentation of
spatio-temporal modelled data and associated uncertainty. The framework is
showcased through application to a case study pertaining to sediment pollution

usually treat text images as general images while ignoring the fact that the
visual quality of strokes (the atomic unit of text) plays an essential role for
text recognition. According to Gestalt Psychology, humans are capable of
composing parts of details into the most similar objects guided by prior
knowledge. Likewise, when humans observe a low-resolution text image, they will
inherently use partial stroke-level details to recover the appearance of
holistic characters. Inspired by Gestalt Psychology, we put forward a
Stroke-Aware Scene Text Image Super-Resolution method containing a
Stroke-Focused Module (SFM) to concentrate on stroke-level internal structures
of characters in text images. Specifically, we attempt to design rules for
decomposing English characters and digits at stroke-level, then pre-train a
text recognizer to provide stroke-level attention maps as positional clues with
the purpose of controlling the consistency between the generated
super-resolution image and high-resolution ground truth. The extensive
experimental results validate that the proposed method can indeed generate more
distinguishable images on TextZoom and manually constructed Chinese character
dataset Degraded-IC13. Furthermore, since the proposed SFM is only used to
provide stroke-level guidance when training, it will not bring any time

cognitive D2D pair, which is the secondary user. The D2D pair needs a bandwidth
for data transmission that can be obtained via spectrum trading. We introduce a
bandwidth-auction game for the spectrum trading problem. The base station (BS)
and CUEs are able to sell their spectrum or share it with the D2D pair, which
allows the D2D pair to operate in orthogonal sharing, cellular, or
non-orthogonal sharing (NOS) modes. Operation of the D2D pair in the NOS mode
causes interference to the CUEs, which is possible under low interference
condition. In the auction, the D2D pair can buy its required spectrum from
three different service providers (SPs) corresponding to each mode that
operateon different frequency spectrums. The D2D pair bids a price bandwidth
demand curve and the SPs offer a price-demand supply curve. Since each player
is not aware of the strategy of other players in practical scenarios, the game
is assumed to be an incomplete information repeated one. A best response based
learning method is proposed for the decision making procedure of all players,
the D2D pair and SPs. It is shown that the proposed method converges to the

paradigm for future wireless networks. Since distributed methods can be more
practical compared to complex centralized schemes, we propose a low-complexity
distributed pricing-based resource allocation algorithm to allocate power to
cellular user equipments (CUEs) and D2D pairs constrained to the minimum
quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of CUEs and D2D pairs in two phases. The
price of each link is set by the base station (BS). CUEs and D2D pairs maximize
their rate-and-interference-dependent utility function by adjusting their power
in the first phase, while the price of each link is updated at the BS based on
the minimum QoS requirements of CUEs and D2D pairs in the second phase. The
proposed utility function controls D2D admission, hence it is suitable for
dense scenarios. The proposed method is fast due to the closed-form solution
for the first phase power allocation. Numerical results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method for practical dense beyond 5G scenarios by
allocating resources to multiple D2D pairs and taking advantage of the spatial
reuse gain of D2D pairs. Furthermore, the utility function definition is
discussed to illustrate its effectiveness for SE maximization. Finally, the SE
of the proposed method is compared to other centralized and distributed

time-series prediction model which takes a series of numerical values as input
to generate a numerical value as a prediction. Although treating this as a
regression problem seems straightforward, incorporating various contextual
information such as the semantic category information of each Place-of-Interest

mobility prediction model. As opposed to the typical approach, we treat
forecasting as a translation problem and propose a novel forecasting through a
language generation pipeline. The paper aims to address the human mobility
forecasting problem as a language translation task in a sequence-to-sequence
manner. A mobility-to-language template is first introduced to describe the
numerical mobility data as natural language sentences. The core intuition of
the human mobility forecasting translation task is to convert the input
mobility description sentences into a future mobility description from which
the prediction target can be obtained. Under this pipeline, a two-branch
network, SHIFT (Translating Human Mobility Forecasting), is designed.
Specifically, it consists of one main branch for language generation and one
auxiliary branch to directly learn mobility patterns. During the training, we
develop a momentum mode for better connecting and training the two branches.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the
proposed SHIFT is effective and presents a new revolutionary approach to
forecasting human mobility.

part of the population to prioritize when assigning the available doses, and
how to manage the interval between doses for multi-dose vaccines. In this
paper, we present an optimization framework to address the dynamic double-dose

In particular, we first identify an age-dependent
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemic model including an
extension capturing partially and fully vaccinated people, whereby we account
for age-dependent immunity and infectiousness levels together with disease
severity. Second, we leverage our model to frame the dynamic age-dependent
vaccine allocation problem for different societal objectives, such as the
minimization of infections or fatalities, and solve it with nonlinear
programming techniques. Finally, we carry out a numerical case study with
real-world data from The Netherlands. Our results show how different societal
objectives can significantly alter the optimal vaccine allocation strategy. For
instance, we find that minimizing the overall number of infections results in
delaying second doses, whilst to minimize fatalities it is important to fully

proposed to train SNNs suffers from large memory footprint and prohibits
backward and update unlocking, making it impossible to exploit the potential of
locally-supervised training methods. This work proposes an efficient and direct
training algorithm for SNNs that integrates a locally-supervised training
method with a temporally-truncated BPTT algorithm. The proposed algorithm
explores both temporal and spatial locality in BPTT and contributes to
significant reduction in computational cost including GPU memory utilization,
main memory access and arithmetic operations. We thoroughly explore the design
space concerning temporal truncation length and local training block size and
benchmark their impact on classification accuracy of different networks running
different types of tasks. The results reveal that temporal truncation has a
negative effect on the accuracy of classifying frame-based datasets, but leads
to improvement in accuracy on dynamic-vision-sensor (DVS) recorded datasets. In
spite of resulting information loss, local training is capable of alleviating
overfitting. The combined effect of temporal truncation and local training can
lead to the slowdown of accuracy drop and even improvement in accuracy. In
addition, training deep SNNs models such as AlexNet classifying CIFAR10-DVS
dataset leads to 7.26% increase in accuracy, 89.94% reduction in GPU memory,
10.79% reduction in memory access, and 99.64% reduction in MAC operations
