Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) S- (2--4 GHz), C- (4--8
GHz), and X-band (8--12 GHz) continuum observations toward seven radio-loud
quasars at $z>5$. This sample has previously been found to exhibit spectral
peaks at observed-frame frequencies above $\sim$1 GHz. We also present upgraded
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) band-2 (200 MHz), band-3 (400 MHz), and
band-4 (650 MHz) radio continuum observations toward eight radio-loud quasars
at $z>5$, selected from our previous GMRT survey, in order to sample their
low-frequency synchrotron emission. Combined with archival radio continuum
observations, all ten targets show evidence for spectral turnover. The turnover
frequencies are $\sim$1--50 GHz in the rest frame, making these targets
gigahertz-peaked-spectrum (GPS) or high-frequency-peaker (HFP) candidates. For
the nine well-constrained targets with observations on both sides of the
spectral turnover, we fit the entire radio spectrum with absorption models
associated with synchrotron self-absorption and free-free absorption (FFA). Our
results show that FFA in an external inhomogeneous medium can accurately
describe the observed spectra for all nine targets, which may indicate an FFA
origin for the radio spectral turnover in our sample. As for the complex
spectrum of J114657.79+403708.6 at $z=5.00$ with two spectral peaks, it may be
caused by multiple components (i.e., core-jet) and FFA by the high-density
medium in the nuclear region. However, we cannot rule out the spectral turnover
origin of variability. Based on our radio spectral modeling, we calculate the
radio loudness $R_{2500\rm\, \AA}$ for our sample, which ranges from
12$^{+1}_{-1}$ to 674$^{+61}_{-51}$.

  Generalized Zero Shot Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generalized zero shot learning (GZSL) is still a technical challenge of deep
learning as it has to recognize both source and target classes without data
from target classes. To preserve the semantic relation between source and
target classes when only trained with data from source classes, we address the
quantification of the knowledge transfer and semantic relation from an
information-theoretic viewpoint. To this end, we follow the prototypical model
and format the variables of concern as a probability vector. Leveraging on the
proposed probability vector representation, the information measurement such as
mutual information and entropy, can be effectively evaluated with simple closed
forms. We discuss the choice of common embedding space and distance function
when using the prototypical model. Then We propose three information-theoretic
loss functions for deterministic GZSL model: a mutual information loss to
bridge seen data and target classes; an uncertainty-aware entropy constraint
loss to prevent overfitting when using seen data to learn the embedding of
target classes; a semantic preserving cross entropy loss to preserve the
semantic relation when mapping the semantic representations to the common
space. Simulation shows that, as a deterministic model, our proposed method
obtains state of the art results on GZSL benchmark datasets. We achieve 21%-64%
improvements over the baseline model -- deep calibration network (DCN) and for
the first time demonstrate a deterministic model can perform as well as
generative ones. Moreover, our proposed model is compatible with generative
models. Simulation studies show that by incorporating with f-CLSWGAN, we obtain
comparable results compared with advanced generative models.

weak Hamiltonian and the heavy quark effective theory (HQET), we describe the
construction of the heavy quark expansion (HQE), which constitutes the
theoretical framework to systematically compute the total decay width of heavy
hadrons, in terms of an expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass.
The structure of the HQE is discussed in detail, and the computation of the
lowest dimensional contributions, explicitly outlined. Particular emphasis is
put in describing the expansion of the quark propagator in the external gluon
field using the Fock-Schwinger (FS) gauge, which represents a fundamental
ingredient of the calculation. Moreover, the main result is the computation of
the dimension-six contribution due to the Darwin operator, only recently
determined and found to have a sizeable effect. Finally, we consider two
phenomenological applications of the HQE in the charm sector, namely the study
of the lifetime of charmed mesons and the analysis of the
Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) cancellations in neutral $D$-meson mixing. By
comparing our results with recent measurements performed by the LHCb, Belle-II
and BESIII collaborations, we conclude that the HQE is able to reproduce,
within large theoretical uncertainties, the experimental pattern for the
lifetimes of charmed mesons and we discuss a potential solution for the
discrepancy of previous theoretical determinations of $D$-mixing with data.

deterministic differential games where agents control their acceleration,
asymptotically in the limit as the number of agents tends to infinity. The
known results for the well-posedness theory of mean field games with control on
the acceleration assume either that the running and final costs are
regularizing functionals of the density variable, or the presence of noise,
i.e. a second-order system. In this article we construct global in time weak
solutions to a first order mean field games system involving kinetic transport
operators, where the costs are local (hence non-regularizing) functions of the
density variable with polynomial growth. We show the uniqueness of these
solutions on the support of the agent density. This is achieved by
characterizing solutions through two convex optimization problems in duality.
As part of our approach, we develop tools for the analysis of mean field games
on a non-compact domain by variational methods. We introduce a notion of
`reachable set', built from the initial measure, that allows us to work with
initial measures with or without compact support. In this way we are able to
obtain crucial estimates on minimizing sequences for merely bounded and
continuous initial measures. These are then carefully combined with $L^1$-type
averaging lemmas from kinetic theory to obtain pre-compactness for the
minimizing sequence. Finally, under stronger convexity and monotonicity
assumptions on the data, we prove higher order Sobolev estimates of the
solutions.

contaminating stellar mass and star-formation rate calculations, we identified
917 galaxies with central, excess X-ray emission likely originating from an
AGN. We analysed their optical emission lines using the BPT diagnostic and
confirmed that such techniques are more effective at reliably identifying
sources as AGN in higher mass galaxies: rising from 30% agreement in the lowest
mass bin to 93% in the highest. We then calculated the growth rates of the
black holes powering these AGN in terms of their specific accretion rates

the majority accreting at rates $\leq 0.5\%$ of their Eddington luminosity.

stellar mass and redshift. After correcting for the varying sensitivity of
3XMM, we split the galaxy sample by stellar mass and redshift and investigated
the AGN fraction as a function of X-ray luminosity and specific black hole
accretion rate. From this we found the fraction of galaxies hosting AGN above a

policies from scratch. However, these methods are notorious for the enormous
amount of required training data which is prohibitively expensive to collect on
real robots. A highly popular alternative is to learn from simulations,
allowing to generate the data much faster, safer, and cheaper. Since all
simulators are mere models of reality, there are inevitable differences between
the simulated and the real data, often referenced as the 'reality gap'. To
bridge this gap, many approaches learn one policy from a distribution over
simulators. In this paper, we propose to combine reinforcement learning from
randomized physics simulations with policy distillation. Our algorithm, called
Distilled Domain Randomization (DiDoR), distills so-called teacher policies,
which are experts on domains that have been sampled initially, into a student
policy that is later deployed. This way, DiDoR learns controllers which
transfer directly from simulation to reality, i.e., without requiring data from
the target domain. We compare DiDoR against three baselines in three sim-to-sim
as well as two sim-to-real experiments. Our results show that the target domain
performance of policies trained with DiDoR is en par or better than the
baselines'. Moreover, our approach neither increases the required memory
capacity nor the time to compute an action, which may well be a point of
failure for successfully deploying the learned controller.

scarcity of high-quality parallel training data, unsupervised learning has
become a trending direction for TST tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel

method which utilizes Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and external style
embeddings to learn semantics and style distribution jointly. Additionally, we
introduce pivot words learning, which is applied to learn decisive words for a

transfer. The proposed VT-STOWER can be scaled to different TST scenarios given
very limited and non-parallel training data with a novel and flexible style

mass between 0.8 and 4.5 TeV are considered using events in which one Higgs
boson decays into a bottom quark pair and the other into final states with
either one or two charged leptons. Specifically, the single-lepton decay

significant excess above the standard model expectation is observed in data.
Model-independent exclusion limits are placed on the product of the cross

Multimodal queries. SIMAT contains 6k images and 18k textual transformation
queries that aim at either replacing scene elements or changing pairwise

consistent with the (source image, text transformation) query. We use an
image/text matching oracle (OSCAR) to assess whether the image transformation
is successful. The SIMAT dataset will be publicly available. We use SIMAT to
evaluate the geometric properties of multimodal embedding spaces trained with
an image/text matching objective, like CLIP. We show that vanilla CLIP
embeddings are not very well suited to transform images with delta vectors, but
that a simple finetuning on the COCO dataset can bring dramatic improvements.
We also study whether it is beneficial to leverage pretrained universal

where users can control the partition of the disentangled latent space to
factorize dataset attributes (concepts) for downstream tasks. Two general
problems remain under-explored in current methods: (1) They lack comprehensive
disentanglement constraints, especially missing the minimization of mutual
information between different attributes across latent and observation domains.
(2) They lack convexity constraints, which is important for meaningfully
manipulating specific attributes for downstream tasks. To encourage both
comprehensive C-Dis-RL and convexity simultaneously, we propose a simple yet
efficient method: Controllable Interpolation Regularization (CIR), which
creates a positive loop where disentanglement and convexity can help each
other. Specifically, we conduct controlled interpolation in latent space during
training, and we reuse the encoder to help form a 'perfect disentanglement'
regularization. In that case, (a) disentanglement loss implicitly enlarges the
potential understandable distribution to encourage convexity; (b) convexity can
in turn improve robust and precise disentanglement. CIR is a general module and
we merge CIR with three different algorithms: ELEGANT, I2I-Dis, and GZS-Net to
show the compatibility and effectiveness. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments show improvement in C-Dis-RL and latent convexity by CIR. This
further improves downstream tasks: controllable image synthesis, cross-modality
image translation, and zero-shot synthesis.

map if its Jacobian is a nonzero scalar (the field has zero characteristic).
Each Jacobian map $\sigma$ is extended to an endomorphism $\sigma$ of the Weyl

  The Jacobian Conjecture (JC) says that every Jacobian map is an automorphism.
Clearly, the Jacobian Conjecture is true iff the twisted (by $\sigma$)
$P_n$-module ${}^{\sigma} P_n$ is 1-generated for all Jacobian maps $\sigma$.
It is shown that the $A_n$-module ${}^{\sigma} P_n$ is 1-generated for all
Jacobian maps $\sigma$. Furthermore, the $A_n$-module ${}^{\sigma} P_n$ is
holonomic and as a result has finite length. An explicit upper bound is found
for the length of the $A_n$-module ${}^{\sigma} P_n$ in terms of the degree
${\rm deg} (\sigma )$ of the Jacobian map $\sigma$. Analogous results are given
for the Conjecture of Dixmier and the Poisson Conjecture. These results show
that the Jacobian Conjecture, the Conjecture of Dixmier and the Poisson
Conjecture are questions about holonomic modules for the Weyl algebra $A_n$,
the images of the Jacobian maps, endomorphisms of the Weyl algebra $A_n$ and
the Poisson endomorphisms are large in the sense that further strengthening of
the results on largeness would be either to prove the conjectures or produce

revealed by templates to design resilient support features for prototyping D3
visualizations: recommendations to suggest complementary interactions for a
user's D3 program; and code augmentation to implement recommended interactions
with a single click, even when users deviate from pre-defined templates. We
demonstrate the utility of these features in Mirny, a d design-focused
prototyping environment for D3. In a user study with 20 D3 users, we find that
these automated features enable participants to prototype their design ideas

modification strategies used by participants to customize D3 templates.
Informed by our findings and participants' feedback, we discuss the key

researched for decades. In recent years, supervised methods have reached
unprecedented accuracy, however they require many pixel-level annotations for
every new class category which is very time-consuming and expensive.
Additionally, the ability of current semantic segmentation networks to handle a
large number of categories is limited. That means that images containing rare
class categories are unlikely to be well segmented by current methods. In this
paper we propose a novel approach for creating semantic segmentation masks for
every object, without the need for training segmentation networks or seeing any
segmentation masks. Our method takes as input the image-level labels of the
class categories present in the image; they can be obtained automatically or
manually. We utilize a vision-language embedding model (specifically CLIP) to
create a rough segmentation map for each class, using model interpretability
methods. We refine the maps using a test-time augmentation technique. The
output of this stage provides pixel-level pseudo-labels, instead of the manual
pixel-level labels required by supervised methods. Given the pseudo-labels, we
utilize single-image segmentation techniques to obtain high-quality output
segmentation masks. Our method is shown quantitatively and qualitatively to
outperform methods that use a similar amount of supervision. Our results are
particularly remarkable for images containing rare categories.

tractability, many approximate stochastic models have been proposed. In this
paper, we focus on one class of such approximations -- time series
Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (TSIR) models. Infectious disease modeling often
starts with a homogeneous mixing assumption, postulating that the rate of
disease transmission is proportional to a product of the numbers of susceptible
and infectious individuals. One popular way to relax this assumption proceeds
by raising the number of susceptible and/or infectious individuals to some
positive powers. We show that when this technique is used within the TSIR
models they cannot be interpreted as approximate SIR models, which has
important implications for TSIR-based statistical inference. Our simulation
study shows that TSIR-based estimates of infection and mixing rates are
systematically biased in the presence of non-homogeneous mixing, suggesting
that caution is needed when interpreting TSIR model parameter estimates when
this class of models relaxes the homogeneous mixing assumption.

multistability depends on the starting position and velocity of the particle.
While for non-zero temperature the ergodicity is in principle restored, in the

into the cosmic history of X-ray emission from normal (non-active) galaxies.
Scaling relations of normal galaxy X-ray luminosity (L_X) with star formation
rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M_star) have been used to show that the formation
rates of low-mass and high-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs and HMXBs, respectively)
evolve with redshift across z = 0-2 following L_HMXB/SFR ~ 1 + z and
L_LMXB/M_star ~ (1 + z)^{2-3}. However, these measurements alone do not
directly reveal the physical mechanisms behind the redshift evolution of X-ray
binaries (XRBs). We derive star-formation histories for a sample of 344 normal
galaxies in the CDFs, using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of
FUV-to-FIR photometric data, and construct a self-consistent, age-dependent
model of the X-ray emission from the galaxies. Our model quantifies how X-ray
emission from hot gas and XRB populations vary as functions of host
stellar-population age. We find that (1) the ratio L_X/M_star declines by a
factor of ~1000 from 0-10 Gyr and (2) the X-ray SED becomes harder with
increasing age, consistent with a scenario in which the hot gas contribution to
the X-ray SED declines quickly for ages above 10 Myr. When dividing our sample
into subsets based on metallicity, we find some indication that L_X/M_star is
elevated for low-metallicity galaxies, consistent with recent studies of X-ray
scaling relations. However, additional statistical constraints are required to
quantify both the age and metallicity dependence of X-ray emission from
star-forming galaxies.

to control the properties of a sequence of statistical tests. In the context of
anomaly detection, the null hypothesis is that an observation is normal and the
alternative is that it is anomalous. FDRC rules allow users to target a lower
bound on precision in unsupervised settings. The methods proposed in this
article overcome short-comings of previous FDRC rules in the context of anomaly
detection, in particular ensuring that power remains high even when the
alternative is exceedingly rare (typical in anomaly detection) and the test
statistics are serially dependent (typical in time series). We show the
soundness of these rules in both theory and experiments.

the first implementation of recoil-free vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) based

time, and each item must be packed into an available bin instantly upon its
arrival. In this paper, we revisit the problem under a setting where the total
number of items T is known in advance, also known as the closed online bin
packing problem. Specifically, we study both the stochastic model and the
random permutation model. We develop and analyze an adaptive algorithm that
solves an offline bin packing problem at geometric time intervals and uses the
offline optimal solution to guide online packing decisions. Under both models,
we show that the algorithm achieves C\sqrt{T} regret (in terms of the number of
used bins) compared to the hindsight optimal solution, where C is a universal
constant (<= 13) that bears no dependence on the underlying distribution or the
item sizes. The result shows the lower bound barrier of \Omega(\sqrt{T \log T})

without a need of knowing the underlying distribution. As to the algorithm
analysis, we develop a new approach to analyzing the packing dynamic using the
notion of exchangeable random variables. The approach creates a symmetrization
between the offline solution and the online solution, and it is used to analyze
both the algorithm performance and various benchmarks related to the bin
packing problem. For the latter one, our analysis provides an alternative
(probably simpler) treatment and tightens the analysis of the asymptotic
benchmark of the stochastic bin packing problem in Rhee and Talagrand

low-dimensional variables often called collective variables. Collective
variables are used to generated reduced representation of free energy surface
and calculate transition probabilities between different metastable basins.
However the choice of collective variables is not trivial for complex systems.
Collective variables ranges from geometric criteria's such as distances,
dihedral angles to abstract ones such as weighted linear combinations of
multiple geometric variables. Advent of machine learning algorithms led to
increasing use of abstract collective variables to represent biomolecular
dynamics. In this review, I will highlight several nuances of commonly used
collective variables ranging from geometric to abstract ones. Further, I will
put forward some cases where machine learning based collective variables were

graph classes have been studied from both the theoretical and practical point
of view. On the one hand, many hard problems can be efficiently solved or
approximated when the input graph is restricted to a geometric intersection
class of graphs. On the other hand, these graphs appear naturally in many
applications such as sensor networks, scheduling problems, and others.
Recently, in the context of distributed certification and distributed
interactive proofs, the recognition of graph classes has started to be
intensively studied. Different results related to the recognition of trees,
bipartite graphs, bounded diameter graphs, triangle-free graphs, planar graphs,
bounded genus graphs, $H$-minor free graphs, etc., have been obtained.
  The goal of the present work is to design efficient distributed protocols for
the recognition of relevant geometric intersection graph classes, namely
permutation graphs, trapezoid graphs, circle graphs, and polygon-circle graphs.
More precisely, for the two first classes, we give proof labeling schemes
recognizing them with logarithmic-sized certificates. For the other two

messages and certificates of size $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$. Finally, we provide
logarithmic lower-bounds on the size of the certificates on the proof labeling

quantum field theory. Specifically, the constraints can be solved by providing
a ""gravitational dressing"" for the underlying field-theory operators, but this
modifies their locality properties. It has been argued that holography itself
may be explained through this role of the gauge symmetry and constraints, at
the nonperturbative level, but there are also subtleties in constructing a
holographic map in this approach. There are also claims that holography is
implied even by perturbative solution of the constraints. This short note
provides further examination of these questions, and in particular investigates
to what extent perturbative or nonperturbative solution of the constraints
implies that information naively thought to be localized can be recovered by
asymptotic measurements, and the relevance of this in defining subsystems. In
the leading perturbative case, the relevant effects are seen to be
exponentially suppressed. These questions are, for example, important in

retrofitting, and control operations. Classical white-box models, based on
physical equations, are bound to follow the laws of physics but the specific
design of their underlying structure might hinder their expressiveness and
hence their accuracy. On the other hand, black-box models are better suited to
capture nonlinear building dynamics and thus can often achieve better accuracy,
but they require a lot of data and might not follow the laws of physics, a
problem that is particularly common for neural network (NN) models. To counter
this known generalization issue, physics-informed NNs have recently been
introduced, where researchers introduce prior knowledge in the structure of NNs
to ground them in known underlying physical laws and avoid classical NN
generalization issues.
  In this work, we present a novel physics-informed NN architecture, dubbed
Physically Consistent NN (PCNN), which only requires past operational data and
no engineering overhead, including prior knowledge in a linear module running
in parallel to a classical NN. We formally prove that such networks are
physically consistent - by design and even on unseen data - with respect to
different control inputs and temperatures outside and in neighboring zones. We
demonstrate their performance on a case study, where the PCNN attains an
accuracy up to 40% better than a classical physics-based resistance-capacitance
model on 3-day long prediction horizons. Furthermore, despite their constrained
structure, PCNNs attain similar performance to classical NNs on the validation
data, overfitting the training data less and retaining high expressiveness to
tackle the generalization issue.

complex optimization dynamics of neural networks, resulting from the
high-dimensional interactions between the large number of network parameters.
Such non-trivial dynamics lead to intriguing behaviors such as the phenomenon
of ""double descent"" of the generalization error. The more commonly studied
aspect of this phenomenon corresponds to model-wise double descent where the
test error exhibits a second descent with increasing model complexity, beyond
the classical U-shaped error curve. In this work, we investigate the origins of
the less studied epoch-wise double descent in which the test error undergoes
two non-monotonous transitions, or descents as the training time increases. By
leveraging tools from statistical physics, we study a linear teacher-student
setup exhibiting epoch-wise double descent similar to that in deep neural
networks. In this setting, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the
evolution of generalization error over training. We find that double descent
can be attributed to distinct features being learned at different scales: as
fast-learning features overfit, slower-learning features start to fit,
resulting in a second descent in test error. We validate our findings through
numerical experiments where our theory accurately predicts empirical findings
and remains consistent with observations in deep neural networks.

of Aubry--Andr\'{e} duality for this model, which partitions the parameter
space into three regions: a supercritical region and a subcritical region that
are dual to one another, and a critical regime that is self-dual. In each
parameter region, we characterize the cocycle dynamics of the transfer matrix
cocycle generated by the associated generalized eigenvalue equation. In
particular, we show that supercritical, critical, and subcritical behavior all
occur in this model. Using Avila's global theory of one-frequency cocycles, we
exactly compute the Lyapunov exponent on the spectrum in terms of the given
parameters. We also characterize the spectral type for each value of the
coupling constant, almost every frequency, and almost every phase. Namely, we
show that for almost every frequency and every phase the spectral type is
purely absolutely continuous in the subcritical region, pure point in the
supercritical region, and purely singular continuous in the critical region. In
some parameter regions, we refine the almost-sure results. In the critical case
for instance, we show that the spectrum is a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue
measure for arbitrary irrational frequency and that the spectrum is purely
singular continuous for all but countably many phases.

Nonlinear coupling of system components is described as the interaction of
individually propagating and exponentially damped impulse trains. The derived

numerical designed and carefully controlled rhythmical beat sequences. The
results are evaluated by comparison in the light of other publications on

many non-parametric regression problems. However its use is less common in
change-point regression, perhaps as its prediction error-based criterion may
appear to permit small spurious changes and hence be less well-suited to
estimation of the number and location of change-points. We show that in fact
the problems of cross-validation with squared error loss are more severe and
can lead to systematic under- or over-estimation of the number of
change-points, and highly suboptimal estimation of the mean function in simple
settings where changes are easily detectable. We propose two simple approaches
to remedy these issues, the first involving the use of absolute error rather
than squared error loss, and the second involving modifying the holdout sets
used. For the latter, we provide conditions that permit consistent estimation
of the number of change-points for a general change-point estimation procedure.
We show these conditions are satisfied for optimal partitioning using new
results on its performance when supplied with the incorrect number of
change-points. Numerical experiments show that the absolute error approach in
particular is competitive with common change-point methods using classical
tuning parameter choices when error distributions are well-specified, but can
substantially outperform these in misspecified models. An implementation of our
methodology is available in the R package crossvalidationCP on CRAN.

successfully generate targeted mis-categorization attacks that achieve higher
transfer success rates on blackbox object detectors than the state-of-the-art.

dissimilarities in atmospheric properties, geophysical activity and magnetic
field generation could hint towards significant differences in the chemical
composition and interior evolution of the two planets. Although various
explanations for the differences between Venus and Earth have been proposed,
the currently available data are insufficient to discriminate among the
different solutions. Here we investigate the possible range of Venus structure
models. We assume that core segregation happened as a single-stage event. The
mantle composition is inferred from the core composition using a prescription
for metal-silicate partitioning. We consider three different cases for the
composition of Venus defined via the bulk Si and Mg content, and the core's S
content. Permissible ranges for the core size, mantle and core composition as
well as the normalized moment of inertia (MoI) are presented for these
compositions. A solid inner core could exist for all compositions. We estimate
that Venus' MoI is 0.317-0.351 and its core size 2930-4350 km for all assumed
compositions. Higher MoI values correspond to more oxidizing conditions during
core segregation. A determination of the abundance of FeO in Venus' mantle by
future missions could further constrain its composition and internal structure.
This can reveal important information on Venus' formation and evolution, and
possibly, the reasons for the differences between Venus and our home planet.

  We answer Mazur's question completely and describe the quadratic points on

Properties Package HP$^3$ to measure the surface heat flow. The package was
designed to use a small penetrator -- nicknamed the mole -- to implement a
string of temperature sensors in the soil to a depth of 5m. The mole itself is
equipped with sensors to measure a thermal conductivity as it proceeds to
depth. The heat flow would be calculated from the product of the temperature
gradient and the thermal conductivity. To avoid the perturbation caused by
annual surface temperature variations, the measurements would be taken at a
depth between 3 m and 5 m. The mole was designed to penetrate cohesionless soil
similar to Quartz sand which was expected to provide a good analogue material
for Martian sand. The sand would provide friction to the buried mole hull to
balance the remaining recoil of the mole hammer mechanism that drives the mole
forward. Unfortunately, the mole did not penetrate more than a mole length of
40 cm. The failure to penetrate deeper was largely due to a few tens of
centimeter thick cohesive duricrust that failed to provide the required
friction. Although a suppressor mass and spring in the hammer mechanism
absorbed much of the recoil, the available mass did not allow a system that
would have eliminated the recoil. The mole penetrated to 40 cm depth benefiting
from friction provided by springs in the support structure from which it was
deployed. It was found in addition that the Martian soil provided unexpected
levels of penetration resistance that would have motivated to designing a more
powerful mole. It is concluded that more mass would have allowed to design a
more robust system with little or no recoil, more energy of the mole hammer
mechanism and a more massive support structure.

different approximation than the one they presented. We show that the new

for dyad-dependent models the errors tend to increase with the level of

Carnegie et al. to the dyad-dependent case, proving that both the old and new
approximations are asymptotically exact as the STERGM time step size goes to
zero, for arbitrary dyad-dependent terms and some dyad-dependent constraints.
We also show that the continuous-time limit of the discrete-time approximations

Currently, we have enough theoretical studies to assure that if Kepler-1625 b-I

explored. Previous works indicated that the most likely scenario is capture,
even though conditions for in situ formation were also investigated. In this

of an additional, massive exomoon being stable in the same system. To model
this scenario we perform N-body simulations of a system including the planet,
Kepler-1625 b-I and one extra Earth-like satellite. Based on previous results,
the satellites in our system will be exposed to tidal interactions with the

between the planet and the satellites is an important mechanism to assure the
stability of satellites in circular orbits closer to the planet, while the 2:1
mean motion resonance between the Earth-like satellite and Kepler-1625 b-I

Broadly, two classes of force dependence have been observed -- slip bonds,
where unbinding rate increases, and catch bonds where unbinding rate decreases.
Despite much theoretical work, we cannot we predict for which protein-ligand
pairs, pulling coordinates, and forces a particular rate dependence will
appear. Here, we assess the ability of MD simulations combined with enhanced
sampling techniques to probe the force dependence of unbinding rates. We show
that the infrequent metadynamics technique correctly produces both catch and
slip bonding kinetics for model potentials. We then apply it to the
well-studied case of a buckyball in a hydrophobic cavity, which appears to
exhibit an ideal slip bond. Finally, we compute the force-dependent unbinding
rate of biotin-streptavidin. Here, the complex nature of the unbinding process
causes the infrequent metadynamics method to begin to break down due to the
presence of unbinding intermediates, despite use of a previously optimized
sampling coordinate. Allowing for this limitation, a combination of kinetic and
free energy computations predict an overall slip bond for larger forces
consistent with prior experimental results, although there are substantial
deviations at small forces that require further investigation. This work
demonstrates the promise of predicting force-dependent unbinding rates using
enhanced sampling MD techniques, while also revealing the methodological
barriers that must be overcome to tackle more complex targets in the future.

\IE, with no degradation in synthesis quality over earlier domains due to
catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we introduce a novel framework that not

(ii) guarantees zero forgetting with a small overhead cost. While being more
memory efficient, thanks to continual learning, our model obtains better
synthesis quality as compared against the brute-force solution that trains one
full model for each domain. Especially, under extreme low-data regimes, our
approach outperforms the brute-force one by a large margin.

model to predict the local PNG bias parameters $b_\phi$ and $b_{\phi\delta}$ of
atomic neutral hydrogen, ${\rm H_I}$. These parameters and their relation to
the linear density bias parameter $b_1$ play a key role in observational
constraints of the local PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ using the ${\rm H_I}$ power
spectrum and bispectrum. Our results show that the popular calculation based on
the universality of the halo mass function overpredicts the $b_\phi(b_1)$ and
$b_{\phi\delta}(b_1)$ relations measured in the simulations. In particular, our
results show that at $z \lesssim 1$ the ${\rm H_I}$ power spectrum is more
sensitive to $f_{\rm NL}$ compared to previously thought ($b_\phi$ is more
negative), but is less sensitive at other epochs ($b_\phi$ is less positive).
We discuss how this can be explained by the competition of physical effects
such as that large-scale gravitational potentials with local PNG (i) accelerate
the conversion of hydrogen to heavy elements by star formation, (ii) enhance
the effects of baryonic feedback that eject the gas to regions more exposed to
ionizing radiation, and (iii) promote the formation of denser structures that
shield the ${\rm H_I}$ more efficiently. Our numerical results can be used to
revise existing forecast studies on $f_{\rm NL}$ using 21cm line-intensity

bias parameters of ${\rm H_I}$, we emphasize that more work is needed to assess
their sensitivity on the assumed galaxy formation physics and ${\rm H_I}$

harmonic (VSH) separation method and the
Frolov-Krtou\v{s}-Kubiz\v{n}\'{a}k-Santos (FKKS) method that separates the
relevant equations in spinning geometries. The analysis in the VSH method
shows, on one hand, that it is arduous to separate the scalar-type from the
vector-type polarizations of the electric sector of the Proca field, and on the
other hand, it displays clearly the electric and the magnetic mode sectors. The
analysis in the FKKS method is performed by taking the nonrotating limit of the
Kerr-AdS spacetime, and shows that the ansatz decouples the polarizations in
the electric mode sector even in the nonrotating limit. On the other hand, it
captures only two of the three possible polarizations, the magnetic mode sector
is missing. The reason for the absence of this polarization is related to the
degeneracy of the principal tensor in static spherical symmetric spacetimes.
The degrees of freedom and quasinormal modes in both separation methods of the
Proca field are found. The frequencies of the quasinormal modes are also
computed. For the electric mode sector in the VSH method the frequencies are
found through an extension, which substitutes number coefficients by matrix
coefficients, of the Horowitz-Hubeny numerical procedure, whereas for the
magnetic mode sector in the VSH method and the electric sector of the FKKS
method it is shown that a direct use of the procedure can be made. The values
of the quasinormal mode frequencies obtained for each method are compared and
showed to be in good agreement with each other. This further supports the

a comparison sample of galaxies, closely matched to the quasar sample in terms
of both stellar mass and redshift. On scales <1 Mpc, the galaxy number counts
and group membership of quasars appear entirely consistent with those of the
matched galaxy sample. Despite this, we find that quasars are ~1.5 times more
likely to be classified as the group center, indicating a potential link
between quasar activity and cold gas flows or galaxy interactions associated
with rich group environments. On scales of ~a few Mpc, the clustering strength
of both samples are statistically consistent and beyond 10 Mpc we find no
evidence that quasars trace large scale structures any more than the galaxy

sheets and filaments to either very high- or very low- density environments.

paradigm in which quasars represent a phase in the lifetime of all massive

to know whether stars in the bar differ in the chemical element composition of
their birth material as compared to disk stars. This requires stellar abundance
measurements for large samples across the Milky Way's body. Such samples, e.g.
luminous red giant stars observed by SDSS's Apogee survey, will inevitably span
a range of stellar parameters; as a consequence, both modelling imperfections
and stellar evolution may preclude consistent and precise estimates of their
chemical composition at a level of purported bar signatures, which has left
current analyses of a chemically distinct bar inconclusive. Here, we develop a
new self-calibration approach to eliminate both modelling and astrophysical
abundance systematics among red giant branch (RGB) stars of different
luminosities (and hence surface gravity $\log g$). We apply our method to
$48,853$ luminous Apogee DR16 RGB stars to construct spatial abundance maps of

With GAIA updated distances, now is a good time to use ALMA archival data for a

understanding of planet formation. This work determines the masses and sizes of
all Herbig dust disks observed with ALMA to date out to 450 pc. These masses
and sizes are put into context of the Lupus and Upper Sco T Tauri disk

making this work 64% complete excluding Orion. Using stellar parameters and
distances the dust masses and sizes of the disks are determined and survival
analysis is used to make cumulative distributions of the dust masses and radii.
Herbig disks have a higher dust mass than the T Tauri disk populations of Lupus
and Upper Sco by factors of $\sim3$ and $\sim7$ respectively. In addition,
Herbig disks are often larger than the typical T Tauri disk. Although the
masses and sizes of Herbig disks extend over a similar range as those of T
Tauri disks, the distributions of masses and sizes of Herbig disks are
significantly skewed toward higher values. Lastly, group I disks are more
massive than group II disks. Based on these findings we speculate that these
differences between Herbig and T Tauri disks find their origin in an initial
disk mass that scales with the stellar mass, and that subsequent disk evolution
enlarges the observable differences, especially if (sub)mm continuum optical
depth plays a role. Moreover, the larger disk masses and sizes of Herbig stars
could be linked to the increasing prevalence of giant planets with host star
mass.

With the launch of several satellites in recent years by NASA, ESA, and other
major space agencies, an ample amount of datasets are at our disposal which can
be utilized to train machine learning models that can automate the arduous
tasks of exoplanet detection, its identification, and habitability
determination. Automating these tasks can save a considerable amount of time
and minimize human errors due to manual intervention. To achieve this aim, we
first analyze the light intensity curves from stars captured by the Kepler
telescope to detect the potential curves that exhibit the characteristics of an
existence of a possible planetary system. For this detection, along with
training conventional models, we propose a stacked GBDT model that can be
trained on multiple representations of the light signals simultaneously.
Subsequently, we address the automation of exoplanet identification and
habitability determination by leveraging several state-of-art machine learning
and ensemble approaches. The identification of exoplanets aims to distinguish
false positive instances from the actual instances of exoplanets whereas the
habitability assessment groups the exoplanet instances into different clusters
based on their habitable characteristics. Additionally, we propose a new metric
called Adequate Thermal Adequacy (ATA) score to establish a potential linear
relationship between habitable and non-habitable instances. Experimental
results suggest that the proposed stacked GBDT model outperformed the
conventional models in detecting transiting exoplanets. Furthermore, the
incorporation of ATA scores in habitability classification enhanced the
performance of models.

of providing spectroscopic membership information for the cluster, and it
supports the chromospheric activity measurements of cluster stars that we

them with the predictions of angular momentum evolution models. We directly
measured 176 photometric rotation periods for the cluster members. An

FGKM stars in NGC 3532. The colour-period diagram constructed from this rich

fast rotator sequence evolved beyond zero-age main sequence age whose stars are
in transition from fast to slow rotation. We also identify an extended slow
rotator sequence, apparently the analogue of the one we previously identified
in NGC 2516. We compare our period distribution to rotational isochrones in
colour-period space and find that all considered models have certain
shortcomings. Using more detailed spin-down models, we evolve the rotation
periods of the younger NGC 2516 forward in time and find that the spindown of
the models is too aggressive with respect to the slow rotators. In contrast,
stars on the evolved fast rotator sequence are not spun down strongly enough by
these models. Our observations suggest a shorter crossing time for the

sensitivity with timescales from $10$ min to $1$ day and a bandwidth of $722$
kHz at $60$ MHz. To model remaining survey selection effects, we introduce a
flexible Bayesian approach for inferring transient rates. We do not detect any
transient and find compelling evidence that our non-detection is inconsistent
with the detection of ILT J225347+862146. Under the assumption that the
transient is astrophysical, we propose two hypotheses that may explain our
non-detection. First, the transient population associated with ILT
J225347+862146 may have a low all-sky density and display strong temporal
clustering. Second, ILT J225347+862146 may be an extreme instance of the
fluence distribution, of which we revise the surface density estimate at $15$
Jy to $1.1\times 10^{-7}$ deg$^{-2}$ with a $95\%$ credible interval of
$(3.5\times10^{-12}, 3.4\times10^{-7})$ deg$^{-2}$. Finally, we find a
previously identified object coincident with ILT J225347+862146 to be an M
dwarf at $420$ pc.

of the rotation-activity relationship that elude studies of multi-age field
populations. We measure the chromospheric activity of cool stars in the 300 Myr
old open cluster NGC 3532 in concert with their rotation periods to study the
mass-dependent morphology of activity for this transitional coeval population.
Using multi-object spectra of the Ca ii infrared triplet region obtained with
the AAOmega spectrograph at the Anglo- Australian Telescope, we measure the
chromospheric emission ratios for 454 FGKM cluster members of NGC 3532. The
morphology of activity against colour appears to be a near-mirror image of the
cluster's rotational behaviour. In particular, we identify a group of
'desaturated transitional rotators' that branches off from the main group of
unsaturated FGK slow rotators, and from which it is separated by an 'activity
gap'. The few desaturated gap stars are identical to the ones in the rotational
gap. Nevertheless, the rotation-activity diagram is completely normal. In fact,
the relationship is so tight that it allows us to predict rotation periods for
many additional stars. We then precisely determine these periods from our
photometric light curves. Our activity measurements show that all fast rotators
of near-solar mass have evolved to become slow rotators, demonstrating that the
absence of fast rotators in a colour-period diagram is not a detection issue
but an astrophysical fact. We also identify a new population of low-activity
stars among the early M dwarfs, enabling us to populate the extended slow
rotator sequence in the colour-period diagram. The joint analysis of
chromospheric activity and photometric time series data thus enables
comprehensive insights into the evolution of the rotation and activity of stars
during the transitional phase between the Pleiades and Hyades age. (Abridged)

generalised form for particles having an arbitrary quantum state. The core of
this proposal is the ability to transform to a Quantum Reference Frame (QRF)
associated to an arbitrary quantum state of a physical system, in which the
metric is locally inertial. Here, we show that this extended EEP, initially
formulated in terms of the local expression of the metric field in a QRF, can
be verified in an interferometric setup via tests on the proper time of
entangled clocks. We find that the violation of the generalised EEP corresponds
to the impossibility of defining dynamical evolution in the frame of each

measurements calculated in the laboratory frame, and hence can be verified in
an interferometric setting.

(-1.6<[X/H]<-0.2) as seen in damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs); it can also be
very metal-poor ([X/H]<-2.4) or even pristine gas ([X/H]<-3.8) not observed in
DLAs, but commonly observed in the IGM. For 16<log N(HI)<20 absorbers, the
frequency of pristine absorbers is about 1%-10%, while for 14.6<log N(HI)<16
absorbers it is 10%-20%, similar to the diffuse IGM. Supersolar gas is
extremely rare (<1%) in this gas. The factor of several thousand spread from
the lowest to highest metallicities and large metallicity variations (a factor
of a few to >100) between absorbers separated by less than 500 km/s imply that
the metals are poorly mixed in 14.6<log N(HI)<20 gas. We show that these
photoionized absorbers contribute to about 10% of the cosmic baryons and 30% of

N(HI), consistent with what is found in z<1 gas. The metallicity of gas in this
column density regime has increased by a factor ~8 from 2.2<z<3.6 to z<1, but
the contribution of the 14.6<log N(HI)<19 absorbers to the total metal budget
of the universe at z<1 is half that at 2.2<z<3.6, indicating a substantial
shift in the reservoirs of metals between these two epochs. We compare the
KODIAQ-Z results to FOGGIE cosmological zoom simulations. The simulations show
an evolution of [X/H] with N(HI) similar to our observational results. Very
metal-poor absorbers with [X/H]<-2.4 at z~2-3 in these simulations are

in discs. Since only the spiral shape from a circularly orbiting perturber is
known, most previous works assume that the planet is in a circular orbit. We
develop a simple semi-analytical method to calculate the shape of the spirals
launched by an eccentric planet. We assume that the planet emits wavelets
during its orbit, and the wave fronts of these propagating wavelets form the
spirals. The resulting spiral shape from this simple method agrees with
numerical simulations exceptionally well. The spirals excited by an eccentric
planet can detach from the planet, bifurcate, or even cross each other, which
are all reproduced by this simple method. The spiral's bifurcation point
corresponds to the wavelet that is emitted when the planet's radial speed
reaches the disc's sound speed. Multiple spirals can be excited by an eccentric
planet (more than 5 spirals when $e\gtrsim0.2$). The pitch angle and pattern
speed are different between different spirals and can vary significantly across
one spiral. The spiral wakes launched by high-mass eccentric planets steepen to
spiral shocks and the crossing of spiral shocks leads to distorted or broken
spirals. With the same mass, a more eccentric planet launches weaker spirals
and induces a shallower gap over a long period of time. The observed unusually
large/small pitch angles of some spirals, the irregular multiple spirals, and
the different pattern speeds between different spirals may suggest the
existence of eccentric perturbers in protoplanetary discs.

magnetic fields merge and annihilate through a current sheet, driving plasma
jets and accelerating non-thermal particle populations to high energy, in
plasmas ranging from space and astrophysical to laboratory scales. Through
laboratory experiments and spacecraft observations, significant experimental
progress has been made in demonstrating how fast dissipation and reconnection
occurs in narrow, kinetic-scale current sheets. However, a challenge has been
to demonstrate what triggers reconnection and how it proceeds rapidly and
efficiently as part of a global system much larger than these kinetic scales.
Here we show experimentally the full development of a process where the current
sheet forms and then breaks up into multiple current-carrying structures at the
ion kinetic scale. The results are consistent with tearing of the current
sheet, however modified by collisionless kinetic ion effects, which leads to a
larger growth rate and number of plasmoids than observed in previous
experiments or compared to predictions from standard tearing instability theory
and previous non-linear kinetic reconnection simulations. This effect will
increase the role of plasmoid instabilities in many natural reconnection
systems and should be considered in triggering rapid reconnection in a broad
range of natural plasmas with collisionless, compressible flows, including at
the Earth's magnetosheath and magnetotail and at the heliopause, in accretion

tendency to overestimate current costs by a bias factor. Kleinberg and Oren
(2014) introduced an elegant graph-theoretical model of inconsistent planning
capturing the behavior of a present-biased agent accomplishing a set of
actions. The essential measure of the system introduced by Kleinberg and Oren
is the cost of irrationality -- the ratio of the total cost of the actions
performed by the present-biased agent to the optimal cost. This measure is
vital for a task designer to estimate the aftermaths of human behavior related
to time-inconsistent planning, including procrastination and abandonment.
  As we prove in this paper, the cost of irrationality is highly susceptible to
the agent's choices when faced with a few possible actions of equal estimated
costs. To address this issue, we propose a modification of Kleinberg-Oren's
model of inconsistent planning. In our model, when an agent selects from
several options of minimum prescribed cost, he uses a randomized procedure. We
explore the algorithmic complexity of computing and estimating the cost of
irrationality in the new model.

statistics. Traditionally, model criticism methods have been based on the
predictive check, an adaptation of goodness-of-fit testing to Bayesian modeling
and an effective method to understand how well a model captures the
distribution of the data. In modern practice, however, researchers iteratively
build and develop many models, exploring a space of models to help solve the
problem at hand. While classical predictive checks can help assess each one,
they cannot help the researcher understand how the models relate to each other.
This paper introduces the posterior predictive null check (PPN), a method for
Bayesian model criticism that helps characterize the relationships between
models. The idea behind the PPN is to check whether data from one model's
predictive distribution can pass a predictive check designed for another model.
This form of criticism complements the classical predictive check by providing
a comparative tool. A collection of PPNs, which we call a PPN study, can help
us understand which models are equivalent and which models provide different
perspectives on the data. With mixture models, we demonstrate how a PPN study,
along with traditional predictive checks, can help select the number of
components by the principle of parsimony. With probabilistic factor models, we
demonstrate how a PPN study can help understand relationships between different
classes of models, such as linear models and models based on neural networks.
Finally, we analyze data from the literature on predictive checks to show how a
PPN study can improve the practice of Bayesian model criticism. Code to

noise from features that are simply small. We address this problem by defining
a family of ""density-scaled filtered complexes"" that includes a density-scaled
\v{C}ech complex and a density-scaled Vietoris--Rips complex. We show that the
density-scaled \v{C}ech complex is homotopy-equivalent to $M$ for filtration
values in an interval whose starting point converges to $0$ in probability as
the number of points $N \to \infty$ and whose ending point approaches infinity
as $N \to \infty$. By contrast, the standard \v{C}ech complex may only be
homotopy-equivalent to $M$ for a very small range of filtration values. The
density-scaled filtered complexes also have the property that they are
invariant under conformal transformations, such as scaling. We implement a
filtered complex $\widehat{DVR}$ that approximates the density-scaled
Vietoris--Rips complex, and we empirically test the performance of our
implementation. As examples, we use $\widehat{DVR}$ to identify clusters that
have different densities, and we apply $\widehat{DVR}$ to a time-delay
embedding of the Lorenz dynamical system. Our implementation is stable (under
conditions that are almost surely satisfied) and designed to handle outliers in
the point cloud that do not lie on $M$.

range of applications \cite{gionis2015dense}. Despite a large number of
applications ranging from computational neuroscience to social network
analysis, that take as input a {\em dual} graph, namely a pair of graphs on the
same set of nodes, dense subgraph discovery methods focus on a single graph
input with few notable exceptions
\cite{semertzidis2019finding,charikar2018finding,reinthal2016finding,jethava2015finding}.
In this work, we focus the following problem: given a pair of graphs $G,H$ on
the same set of nodes $V$, how do we find a subset of nodes $S \subseteq V$
that induces a well-connected subgraph in $G$ and a dense subgraph in $H$?
  Our formulation generalizes previous research on dual graphs
\cite{Wu+15,WuZLFJZ16,Cui2018}, by enabling the {\em control} of the
connectivity constraint on $G$. We propose a novel mathematical formulation
based on $k$-edge connectivity, and prove that it is solvable exactly in
polynomial time. We compare our method to state-of-the-art competitors; we find
empirically that ranging the connectivity constraint enables the practitioner
to obtain insightful information that is otherwise inaccessible. Finally, we
show that our proposed mining tool can be used to better understand how users
interact on Twitter, and connectivity aspects of human brain networks with and
without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

  https://github.com/yiren-jian/LabelHalluc",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Few-shot classification requires adapting knowledge learned from a large
annotated base dataset to recognize novel unseen classes, each represented by
few labeled examples. In such a scenario, pretraining a network with high
capacity on the large dataset and then finetuning it on the few examples causes
severe overfitting. At the same time, training a simple linear classifier on
top of ""frozen"" features learned from the large labeled dataset fails to adapt
the model to the properties of the novel classes, effectively inducing
underfitting. In this paper we propose an alternative approach to both of these
two popular strategies. First, our method pseudo-labels the entire large
dataset using the linear classifier trained on the novel classes. This
effectively ""hallucinates"" the novel classes in the large dataset, despite the
novel categories not being present in the base database (novel and base classes
are disjoint). Then, it finetunes the entire model with a distillation loss on
the pseudo-labeled base examples, in addition to the standard cross-entropy
loss on the novel dataset. This step effectively trains the network to
recognize contextual and appearance cues that are useful for the novel-category
recognition but using the entire large-scale base dataset and thus overcoming
the inherent data-scarcity problem of few-shot learning. Despite the simplicity
of the approach, we show that that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art

junctions where only Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is present, the
topological phase diagram is insensitive to the supercurrent direction, but
exhibits a strong dependence on the magnetic field orientation. However, when
both Rashba and Dresselhaus SOCs coexist, the topological phase diagram
strongly depends on both the magnetic field and junction crystallographic
orientations. We examine the impact of the magnetic and crystalline anisotropy
on the current-phase relation (CPR), energy spectrum, and topological gap of
phase-biased JJs, where the junction is connected in a loop and the
superconducting phase difference is fixed by a loop-threading magnetic flux.
The anisotropic CPR can be used to extract the ground-sate phase (i.e. the
superconducting phase difference that minimizes the system free energy)
behavior in phase-unbiased JJs with no magnetic flux. Under appropriate
conditions, phase-unbiased JJs can self-tune into or out of the topological
superconducting state by rotating the in-plane magnetic field. The magnetic
field orientations at which topological transitions occur strongly depend on
both the junction crystallographic orientation and the relative strength
between Rashba and Dresselhaus SOCs. We find that for an optimal practical
application, in which the junction exhibits topological superconductivity with
a sizable topological gap, a careful balancing of the magnetic field direction,
the junction crystallographic orientation, and the relative strengths of the

of nonexpansive kernels that are shown to induce Hilbert spaces consisting of
only Lipschitz continuous operators. The Lipschitz constant of estimated
operators within such Hilbert spaces can be tuned by suitable selection of a
regularization parameter. As is typical for kernel-based models, input-output

framework to derive robust stability criteria. It also uses simulated policy
rollouts to obtain gradients on the controller parameters, which serve to
improve the closed-loop performance. By formulating the stability criteria as
penalties with computable gradients, they can be used to guide the controller
parameters toward robust stability during gradient descent. The approach is
flexible as it does not restrict the type of learned model for the simulated
rollouts. The robust control framework ensures that the controller is already
robustly stabilizing when first implemented on the actual system and no data is
yet collected. It also ensures that the system stays stable in the event of a
shift in dynamics, given the system behavior remains within assumed uncertainty
bounds. We demonstrate the approach by synthesizing a controller for simulated
autonomous lane change maneuvers. This work thus presents a flexible approach
to learning robustly stabilizing LTI controllers that take advantage of modern

class of record linkage problems in multipartite entity resolution across many
datasets as a combinatorial optimization problem known as the multidimensional
assignment problem. As a motivation for our approach, we illustrate the
advantage of multipartite entity resolution over sequential bipartite matching.
Because the optimization problem is NP-hard, we apply two heuristic procedures,
a Greedy algorithm and very large scale neighborhood search, to solve the
assignment problem and find the most likely matching of records from multiple
datasets into a single entity. We evaluate and compare the performance of these
algorithms and their modifications on synthetically generated data. We perform
computational experiments to compare performance of recent heuristic, the very
large-scale neighborhood search, with a Greedy algorithm, another heuristic for
the MAP, as well as with two versions of genetic algorithm, a general
metaheuristic. Importantly, we perform experiments to compare two alternative
methods of re-starting the search for the former heuristic, specifically a
random-sampling multi-start and a deterministic design-based multi-start. We
find evidence that design-based multi-start can be more efficient as the size
of databases grow large. In addition, we show that very large scale search,
especially its multi-start version, outperforms simple Greedy heuristic.
Hybridization of Greedy search with very large scale neighborhood search
improves the performance. Using multi-start with as few as three additional
runs of very large scale search offers some improvement in the performance of
the very large scale search procedure. Last, we propose an approach to
evaluating complexity of the very large-scale neighborhood search.

uncertainty bounds prior to learning. Also, the uncertainty bounds should only
be tightened if the collected data sufficiently capture the future system
behavior. To support the principle, two example problems are solved with

with ALMA; and Astrochemical Surveys at IRAM (ASAI) conducted with the Institut

up to 330 GHz, and J=95 and Ka=20 in the range from 400 - 660 GHz were

a well-known yet little studied limitation of discrete MRFs is that they cannot
capture context-specific independence (CSI). Existing methods require carefully
developed theories and purpose-built inference methods, which limit their
applications to only small-scale problems. In this paper, we propose the Markov
Attention Model (MAM), a family of discrete MRFs that incorporates an attention
mechanism. The attention mechanism allows variables to dynamically attend to
some other variables while ignoring the rest, and enables capturing of CSIs in
MRFs. A MAM is formulated as an MRF, allowing it to benefit from the rich set
of existing MRF inference methods and scale to large models and datasets. To
demonstrate MAM's capabilities to capture CSIs at scale, we apply MAMs to
capture an important type of CSI that is present in a symbolic approach to
recurrent computations in perceptual grouping. Experiments on two recently
proposed synthetic perceptual grouping tasks and on realistic images
demonstrate the advantages of MAMs in sample-efficiency, interpretability and
generalizability when compared with strong recurrent neural network baselines,

modern Earth (mass, geography, atmosphere). We first simulated planets with
fixed rotational axes and circular orbits, finding that the vast majority
(>90%) of planets with habitable surfaces are free of ice. For planets with
partial ice coverage, the parameter space for ice caps (interannual ice located
at the poles) is about as large as that for ""ice belts"" (interannual ice
located at the equator), but belts only persist on land. We then performed
simulations that mimicked perturbations from other planets by forcing
sinusoidal orbital and rotational oscillations over a range of frequencies and
amplitudes. We assume initially ice-free surfaces and set the initial
eccentricity distribution to mirror known exoplanets, while the initial
obliquity distribution matches planet formation predictions, ie favoring 90
degrees. For these dynamic cases, we find again that ~90% of habitable planets
are free of surface ice for a range of assumptions for ice's albedo. Planets
orbiting F dwarfs are three times as likely to have ice caps than belts, but
for planets orbiting K and G dwarfs ice belts are twice as likely as caps. In
some cases, a planet's surface ice can cycle between the equatorial and polar
regions. Future direct imaging surveys of habitable planets may be able to test

investigates a possible influence on $\alpha$ for $Ar, N_2, He$ within

whether the assumption of $\alpha$ = 1 is valid. By using a parallel plates
device, very similar to the guarded-hot-plate, following EN 12667 it was
possible to determine $\alpha$ on a dense $CaSiO_3$. It occured that the
assumptions $\alpha$ = 1 (for $Ar, N_2$) and $\alpha$ = 0.3 (for $He$) are
valid for measurements near room temperature. Further, physical adsorption was
found to increase $\alpha$. The determination of the influence of roughness has
been started showing an interesting effect, but it still remains an open topic.
In a collaborative study molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed
showing a strong equivalence of $\alpha$ between $SiO_2$ and $CaSiO_3$. These
results can be considered a lower limit of $\alpha$ as neither roughness nor
adsorption processes have been included in the simulation. Therefore, any
deviations between experiments and MD could be considered as an appearance of

this value and to analyse the variations that occur outside of those limits, we
present an alternative approach to the slug-flow model to predict the
non-dimensional energy of a vortex ring. Our approach is based on the
self-similar vortex sheet roll-up described by Pullin. We derive the vorticity
distribution for the vortex core resulting from a spiralling shear layer
roll-up and compute the associated non-dimensional energy. To demonstrate the
validity of our model, we consider different velocity profiles of the vortex
generator that follow a power-law with a variable exponent m. For a constant
velocity (m=0), our model yields a non-dimensional energy of E*=0.33. For a
constant acceleration (m=1), we find E*=0.19. For a constant velocity, we
obtain realistic vorticity distributions by radially diffusing the vorticity
distribution of the Pullin spiral and predict a decrease of the non-dimensional
energy from 0.33 to 0.28, in accordance with experimental results. Our proposed
model offers a practical alternative to the existing slug flow model to predict
the minimum non-dimensional energy of a vortex ring. The model is applicable to
piston-generated and wake vortex rings and requires only the kinematics of the

eclipsing binary system where both components are low-mass white dwarfs, with
stellar masses of 0.362$\pm$0.014~M$_{\odot}$ and 0.325$\pm$0.013~M$_{\odot}$.
In particular, the less massive component is a pulsating star, showing at least
three pulsation periods of $\sim$1314 s, $\sim$1069 s and $\sim$582.9 s. This
opens the way to use asteroseismology as a tool to uncover its inner chemical

constraints and a ten-dimensional hypersphere. We show that in all cases the
combined midpoint method has greatly reduced errors compared to methods using a
combined Euler projection approach or purely tangential projection. Our
technique can handle multiple constraints. This allows manifolds that embody

essentially viewing it as a search problem where the starting point is a
default CNN model, and mutation of this CNN model allows exploration of the
space of CNN models to find a CNN model that will work best for the problem.
These works have had significant success in producing high-accuracy CNN models.
There are two problems, however. First, NAS can be very costly, often taking
several hours to complete. Second, CNN models produced by NAS can be very
complex that makes it harder to understand them and costlier to train them. We
propose a novel approach for NAS, where instead of starting from a default CNN
model, the initial model is selected from a repository of models extracted from
GitHub. The intuition being that developers solving a similar problem may have
developed a better starting point compared to the default model. We also
analyze common layer patterns of CNN models in the wild to understand changes
that the developers make to improve their models. Our approach uses commonly
occurring changes as mutation operators in NAS. We have extended Auto-Keras to
implement our approach. Our evaluation using 8 top voted problems from Kaggle

the same search time, without loss of accuracy, Manas produces models with

remarkably successful for high dimensional data spaces. Some DC methods employ
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), motivated by the powerful latent
representations these models are able to learn implicitly. In this work, we
propose HC-MGAN, a new technique based on GANs with multiple generators
(MGANs), which have not been explored for clustering. Our method is inspired by
the observation that each generator of a MGAN tends to generate data that
correlates with a sub-region of the real data distribution. We use this
clustered generation to train a classifier for inferring from which generator a
given image came from, thus providing a semantically meaningful clustering for
the real distribution. Additionally, we design our method so that it is
performed in a top-down hierarchical clustering tree, thus proposing the first
hierarchical DC method, to the best of our knowledge. We conduct several
experiments to evaluate the proposed method against recent DC methods,
obtaining competitive results. Last, we perform an exploratory analysis of the
hierarchical clustering tree that highlights how accurately it organizes the
data in a hierarchy of semantically coherent patterns.

conditional occurrence of two classes of planets: close-in small planets

that $42^{+17}_{-13}\%$ of cold giant hosts also host an inner small planet,
compared to $27.6^{+5.8}_{-4.8}\%$ of stars irrespective of cold giant

small planets are less likely to host outer giant companions more massive than
approximately 120 Earth masses and within 0.3--3 au than to host less massive
or more distant giant companions, with $\sim$2.2$\sigma$ confidence. This

distributions for systems with only small planets and those with both small
planets and cold giants. In agreement with previous studies, we find that stars
in our survey that only host small planets have a metallicity distribution that
is consistent with the broader solar-metallicity-median sample, while stars
that host both small planets and gas giants are distinctly metal-rich with

scattering in the magnetosphere, and also account for the broadband spectral
energy distribution of these sources from below 1 keV to nearly 100 keV. We
find that either atmospheres or condensed surfaces can account for the emission
at a few keV; in both cases either a small hot polar cap or scattering is
required to account for the emission at 5-10 keV, and above 10 keV scattering
by a hard population of electrons can account for the rising power in the hard
X-rays observed in many magnetars in quiescence. Although these different
scenarios result in very similar spectral energy distributions, they generate
dramatically different polarization signatures from 2-10 keV, which is the
range of sensitivity of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. Observations of

LISA. However, if QPEs are made of eccentric WD-MBH binaries, they radiate GWs
in a wide range of frequencies. The broad spectra overlap to form a background
which, between $0.003-0.02$ Hz, exceeds the background known to exist due to
other types of sources. Presence of this GW background in the LISA band could
impact the future search for the seed black holes at high redshift as well as
the stellar-mass binary black holes in the local universe.

to the coupling between the borehole fluid and the surrounding poroelastic
formation. The tube waves have been exploited in the past to infer the in-situ
hydraulic properties. In order to understand better the physical mechanisms
underlying the generation of tube waves at a fault zone, we develop a new model
that calculates the pressure responses in a borehole. The model incorporates
simultaneous effects of elastic impedance boundaries, fluid infiltration from
poroelastic formation, and irregularities in the borehole radius. The
analytical tube-wave amplitudes are derived from the new model assuming a
normally incident plane P wave, verified by complete numerical solutions for
Biot's theory of dynamic poroelasticity. We find that the upgoing and downgoing
tube waves due to an elastic impedance boundary have opposite polarities, and
those excited by a thin poroelastic layer have different wave shapes. The model
also enables the prediction of a VSP response at a major fault zone in Japan
(Nojima fault). Our quantitative evaluation suggests that tube waves are
generated by elastic impedance boundaries and borehole irregularities around
the main shear zone of the fault, as well as due to the presence of several
porous layers. We also find that the modeled amplitudes agree well with the
observation, especially when assuming a heterogeneous permeability
distribution. The developed model and the presented results will be crucial in
quantitatively interpreting the VSP data in order to estimate the fault zone's

the feature spaces extracted from images by trained models (in their hidden
layers, including the 64-dimensional feature space in the last hidden layer of
pre-trained residual neural networks), and also the feature space extracted by
wavelets/shearlets. In all these domains, testing samples considerably fall
outside the convex hull of training sets, and image classification requires
extrapolation. In contrast to the deep learning literature, in cognitive
science, psychology, and neuroscience, extrapolation and learning are often
studied in tandem. Moreover, many aspects of human visual cognition and
behavior are reported to involve extrapolation. We propose a novel
extrapolation framework for the mathematical study of deep learning models. In
our framework, we use the term extrapolation in this specific way of
extrapolating outside the convex hull of training set (in the pixel space or
feature space) but within the specific scope defined by the training data, the
same way extrapolation is defined in many studies in cognitive science. We
explain that our extrapolation framework can provide novel answers to open
research problems about deep learning including their over-parameterization,
their training regime, out-of-distribution detection, etc. We also see that the
extent of extrapolation is negligible in learning tasks where deep learning is
reported to have no advantage over simple models.

gradients through the SNN. Hybrid SNN-ANNs can be trained without conversion,
and result in highly accurate networks that are substantially more
computationally efficient than their ANN counterparts. We demonstrate results
on event-based classification and object detection datasets, in which only the
architecture of the ANN heads need to be adapted to the tasks, and no
conversion of the event-based input is necessary. Since ANNs and SNNs require
different hardware paradigms to maximize their efficiency, we envision that SNN
backbone and ANN head can be executed on different processing units, and thus
analyze the necessary bandwidth to communicate between the two parts. Hybrid
networks are promising architectures to further advance machine learning
approaches for event-based vision, without having to compromise on efficiency.

are grouped by similarity, the distribution of spectra onto the map for a
single galaxy, i.e., its ""fingerprint"", reveals the presence of distinct
stellar populations within the galaxy indicating smoother or episodic
star-formation histories. We further map the diversity of galaxy fingerprints
onto a second map (DESOM-2). Using galaxy images and independent measures of
galaxy morphology, we confirm that galaxies with similar fingerprints have
similar morphologies and inclination angles. Since morphological information
was not used in the mapping algorithm, relating galaxy morphology to the
star-formation histories encoded in the fingerprints is one example of how the
DESOM maps can be used to make scientific inferences.

""matrix epidemic models"" introduced in [1], an explicit general formula for the
reproduction number and the corresponding ""weak stability alternative"" still
holds, under small modifications, for models with nonconstant population size,
and even when the model allows for vaccination and loss of immunity. The
importance of this result is clear once we note that the models of [1] include
a large number of viral and bacterial models of epidemic propagation, including
for example the totality of homogeneous COVID-19 models. To better understand
the nature of the result, we emphasize that the models proposed in [1] and
considered here are extensions of the SIR-PH model, which is essentially
characterized by a phase-type distribution that models transitions between the
""disease/infectious compartments"". In these cases, the reproduction number and
a certain Lyapunov function for the disease free equilibrium are explicitly
expressible. Not surprisingly, accounting for varying demography, loss of
immunity, and vaccinations lead to several challenges. One of the most
important is that a varying population size leads to multiple endemic
equilibrium points: this is in contrast with ""classic models"" which in general
admit unique disease-free and endemic equilibria. As a special case of our
analysis, we consider a ""first approximation"" (FA) of our model, which
coincides with the constant-demography model often studied in the literature,

between all pairs of distributions. Such a generalization leads to important
new applications such as estimating statistical discrepancy among multiple

at the interface of game theory and computer science. It is well known that a
general normal form game in N players and k strategies requires exponential
space simply to write down. This Curse of Multi-Agents prompts the study of
succinct games which can be written down efficiently. A canonical example of a
succinct game is the graphical game which models players as nodes in a graph
interacting with only their neighbors in direct analogy with markov random
fields. Graphical games have found applications in wireless, financial, and
social networks. However, computing the nash equilbrium of graphical games has
proven challenging. Even for polymatrix games, a model where payoffs to an
agent can be written as the sum of payoffs of interactions with the agent's
neighbors, it has been shown that computing an epsilon approximate nash
equilibrium is PPAD hard for epsilon smaller than a constant. The focus of this
work is to circumvent this computational hardness by considering average case
graph models i.e random graphs. We provide a quasipolynomial time approximation

HERA and the SKA will provide new scientific insights and exciting implications
for astrophysics and cosmology regarding the Epoch of Reionization (EoR).
Several recent works have proposed using machine learning methods, such as
convolutions neural networks (CNNs), to analyze images of reionization
generated by these experiments since they could take full advantage of
information contained in the image. Generally, these studies have used only a
single semi-numeric method to generate the input 21cm data. In this work, we
investigate the extent to which training CNNs for reionization applications
depends on the underlying semi-numeric models. Working in the context of
predicting CMB optical depth from 21cm images, we compare networks trained on
similar datasets from 21cmfast and zreion, two widely used semi-numeric
reionization methods. We show that neural networks trained on input data from
only one model produce poor predictions on data from the other model.
Satisfactory results are only achieved when both models are included in the
training data. This finding has important implications for future analyses on
observation data, and encourages the use of multiple models to produce images
that capture the full complexity of the EoR.

especially in multiview geometry problems. Traditional methods for solving
these systems typically aim to eliminate variables to reach a univariate
polynomial, e.g., a tenth-order polynomial for 5-point pose estimation, using
clever manipulations, or more generally using Grobner basis, resultants, and
elimination templates, leading to successful algorithms for multiview geometry
and other problems. However, these methods do not work when the problem is
complex and when they do, they face efficiency and stability issues. Homotopy
Continuation (HC) can solve more complex problems without the stability issues,
and with guarantees of a global solution, but they are known to be slow. In
this paper we show that HC can be parallelized on a GPU, showing significant
speedups up to 26 times on polynomial benchmarks. We also show that GPU-HC can
be generically applied to a range of computer vision problems, including 4-view
triangulation and trifocal pose estimation with unknown focal length, which
cannot be solved with elimination template but they can be efficiently solved
with HC. GPU-HC opens the door to easy formulation and solution of a range of

perovskite layer and instead employed a variety of different contact materials
to create functionality. Only recently, intentional, or unintentional doping of
the perovskite layer is more frequently invoked as an important factor
explaining differences in photovoltaic or optoelectronic performance in certain
devices. Here we use numerical simulations to study the influence of doping and
photodoping on photoluminescence quantum yield as well as other device relevant
metrics. We find that doping can improve the photoluminescence quantum yield by
making radiative recombination faster. This effect can benefit or harm
photovoltaic performance given that the improvement of photoluminescence
quantum efficiency and open-circuit voltage is accompanied by a reduction of
the diffusion length. This reduction will eventually lead to inefficient
carrier collection at high doping densities. The photovoltaic performance might
improve at an optimum doping density which depends on a range of factors such
as the mobilities of the different layers and the ratio of the capture cross
sections for electrons and holes.

Thus, development of automatic methods for evaluation of histopathological

images (WSIs) of breast cancer from a Norwegian cohort. We propose a cascaded
convolutional neural network design, called H2G-Net, for semantic segmentation
of gigapixel histopathological images. The design involves a detection stage
using a patch-wise method, and a refinement stage using a convolutional
autoencoder. To validate the design, we conducted an ablation study to assess
the impact of selected components in the pipeline on tumour segmentation.
Guiding segmentation, using hierarchical sampling and deep heatmap refinement,
proved to be beneficial when segmenting the histopathological images. We found
a significant improvement when using a refinement network for postprocessing
the generated tumour segmentation heatmaps. The overall best design achieved a
Dice score of 0.933 on an independent test set of 90 WSIs. The design
outperformed single-resolution approaches, such as cluster-guided, patch-wise
high-resolution classification using MobileNetV2 (0.872) and a low-resolution
U-Net (0.874). In addition, segmentation on a representative x400 WSI took ~58
seconds, using only the CPU. The findings demonstrate the potential of
utilizing a refinement network to improve patch-wise predictions. The solution
is efficient and does not require overlapping patch inference or ensembling.
Furthermore, we showed that deep neural networks can be trained using a random
sampling scheme that balances on multiple different labels simultaneously,
without the need of storing patches on disk. Future work should involve more
efficient patch generation and sampling, as well as improved clustering.

CardEst, i.e., how to estimate the join query size on multiple tables, has not

convergence property remains to be a mystery. It is far from satisfactory in
the sense that some studies require strong assumptions about the updates, which
are not necessarily applicable in practice, while other studies still follow
the original problematic convergence analysis of Adam, which was shown to be
not sufficient to ensure convergence. Although rigorous convergence analysis
exists for Adam, they impose specific requirements on the update of the
adaptive step size, which are not generic enough to cover many other variants
of Adam. To address theses issues, in this extended abstract, we present a
simple and generic proof of convergence for a family of Adam-style methods
(including Adam, AMSGrad, Adabound, etc.). Our analysis only requires an
increasing or large ""momentum"" parameter for the first-order moment, which is
indeed the case used in practice, and a boundness condition on the adaptive
factor of the step size, which applies to all variants of Adam under mild
conditions of stochastic gradients. We also establish a variance diminishing
result for the used stochastic gradient estimators. Indeed, our analysis of
Adam is so simple and generic that it can be leveraged to establish the
convergence for solving a broader family of non-convex optimization problems,

uses a deep neural network (DNN) as a predictor, has been shown to achieve good
performance even in complex environments and with high dimensional inputs.
However, the training of DRL models require a large amount of data, which may
limit its adaptability to ever-evolving statistics of the underlying

where centralized DRL approaches would require excessive data exchange, while
fully distributed approaches may result in slower convergence rates and
performance degradation. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose

simultaneously virtually visit the bridge structure for final assessment. In
this work, we present an SHM system in a VR environment that includes the

correlation learned by self-attention is often loose and implicit, inefficient
in capturing crucial cross-lingual representations between languages. The
matter worsens when performing on languages with separate morphological or
structural features, making the cross-lingual alignment more challenging,
resulting in the performance drop. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel
Knowledge-Distillation-based framework for Cross-Lingual Summarization, seeking
to explicitly construct cross-lingual correlation by distilling the knowledge
of the monolingual summarization teacher into the cross-lingual summarization
student. Since the representations of the teacher and the student lie on two
different vector spaces, we further propose a Knowledge Distillation loss using
Sinkhorn Divergence, an Optimal-Transport distance, to estimate the discrepancy
between those teacher and student representations. Due to the intuitively
geometric nature of Sinkhorn Divergence, the student model can productively
learn to align its produced cross-lingual hidden states with monolingual hidden
states, hence leading to a strong correlation between distant languages.
Experiments on cross-lingual summarization datasets in pairs of distant
languages demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models under

to explain both the shape and the dynamical evolution of $\eta$ Car's nebula.
As in our previous work, we have assumed a two-stage scenario for $\eta$ Car's
eruption: a slow outflow phase during a few decades before the eruption
followed by the explosive event. From the collision of these outflow phases,
the large Homunculus is produced. Our numerical simulations show that such
scenario does not resemble some of the observed physical features and the
expansion of the nebula. Notwithstanding, we also explore other injection
parameters (mass-loss rate and ejection velocity) for these outflow phases. In
particular, we find that an explosion with an intermediate-speed of 1000 km

threat, mostly by increasing the cost of model stealing. In this paper, we
explore the defense from another angle by verifying whether a suspicious model

Specifically, we embed the external features by tempering a few training
samples with style transfer. We then train a meta-classifier to determine
whether a model is stolen from the victim. This approach is inspired by the
understanding that the stolen models should contain the knowledge of features
learned by the victim model. We examine our method on both CIFAR-10 and

three-dimensional system with a Bardeen-Pines-like interaction in the
low-density limit, where the chemical potential $\mu$ is much smaller than the
phonon frequency $\omega_L$. We parameterize the strength of the repulsion by a
dimensionless parameter $f$, and find that the superconducting transition
temperature $T_c$ approaches a nonzero value in the $\mu = 0$ limit as long as
$f$ is below a certain threshold $f^*$. In this limit, we find that $T_c$ goes
to zero as a power of $f^*-f$, in contrast to the high density limit, where
$T_c$ goes to zero exponentially quickly as $f$ approaches $f^*$. For all
nonzero $f$, the gap function $\Delta (\omega_m)$ changes sign along the
Matsubara axis, which allows the system to partially overcome the repulsion at
high frequencies. We trace the position of the gap node with $f$ and show that
it approaches zero frequency as $f$ approaches $f^*$. To investigate the
robustness of our conclusions, we then go beyond the Bardeen-Pines model and

as a path forward for highly accurate electronic structure calculations.
Previous proposals have combined equivariant neural network layers with an
antisymmetric layer to satisfy the antisymmetry requirements of the electronic
wavefunction. However, to date it is unclear if one can represent antisymmetric
functions of physical interest, and it is difficult to measure the
expressiveness of the antisymmetric layer. This work attempts to address this
problem by introducing explicitly antisymmetrized universal neural network
layers as a diagnostic tool. We first introduce a generic antisymmetric (GA)
layer, which we use to replace the entire antisymmetric layer of the highly
accurate ansatz known as the FermiNet. We demonstrate that the resulting
FermiNet-GA architecture can yield effectively the exact ground state energy
for small systems. We then consider a factorized antisymmetric (FA) layer which
more directly generalizes the FermiNet by replacing products of determinants
with products of antisymmetrized neural networks. Interestingly, the resulting
FermiNet-FA architecture does not outperform the FermiNet. This suggests that
the sum of products of antisymmetries is a key limiting aspect of the FermiNet
architecture. To explore this further, we investigate a slight modification of
the FermiNet called the full determinant mode, which replaces each product of
determinants with a single combined determinant. The full single-determinant
FermiNet closes a large part of the gap between the standard single-determinant
FermiNet and FermiNet-GA. Surprisingly, on the nitrogen molecule at a
dissociating bond length of 4.0 Bohr, the full single-determinant FermiNet can
significantly outperform the standard 64-determinant FermiNet, yielding an
energy within 0.4 kcal/mol of the best available computational benchmark.

neglect of noise sensitivity differences between image regions by existing
decision-based attacks further compromises the efficiency of noise compression,
especially for ViTs. Therefore, validating the black-box adversarial robustness
of ViTs when the target model can only be queried still remains a challenging
problem. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the limitations of existing
decision-based attacks from the perspective of noise sensitivity difference
between regions of the image, and propose a new decision-based black-box attack
against ViTs, termed Patch-wise Adversarial Removal (PAR). PAR divides images
into patches through a coarse-to-fine search process and compresses the noise
on each patch separately. PAR records the noise magnitude and noise sensitivity
of each patch and selects the patch with the highest query value for noise
compression. In addition, PAR can be used as a noise initialization method for
other decision-based attacks to improve the noise compression efficiency on
both ViTs and CNNs without introducing additional calculations. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate that PAR achieves a much lower noise
magnitude with the same number of queries.

covariate-shifted conformal inference to this more general setting. The result
is a predictive interval that has guaranteed nominal coverage of the ITE, a

advance. Changing an asteroid's albedo changes the force of Solar radiation on
it, and hence its orbit. Albedo may be changed by applying a thin ($\sim
0.1\,\mu$) reflective coat of alkali metal, dispensed as vapor by an orbiting
spacecraft. A complete coat reduces the effective Solar gravity, changing the
orbital period. A Tunguska-class (50 m diameter) asteroid in a nominal orbit
with perihelion 1 AU and aphelion 3 AU ($a = 2\,$AU, $e = 0.5$) may be
displaced along its path by $\sim 1000\,$km in 100 years, sufficient to avoid
impact in a populated area, by application of one kg of lithium or sodium metal
over its entire surface. Alternatively, coating one hemisphere of an asteroid
in an elliptical orbit may produce a Solar radiation torque, analogous to but
distinct from the Yarkovsky effect, displacing it by an Earth radius in $\sim
200$ years. The time required scales as the square root of the asteroid's
diameter (the 1/6 power of its mass) because the displacement increases
quadratically with time, making it possible to prevent the catastrophic impact
of a km-sized asteroid with a minimal mass.

more important challenge. Previous research on this problem has mainly focused
on improving DGMs by either introducing new objective functions or designing
more expressive model architectures. However, such approaches often introduce
significantly more computational and/or designing overhead. To resolve such
issues, we introduce in this paper a generic framework called {\em
generative-model inference} that is capable of enhancing pre-trained GANs
effectively and seamlessly in a variety of application scenarios. Our basic
idea is to efficiently infer the optimal latent distribution for the given
requirements using Wasserstein gradient flow techniques, instead of re-training
or fine-tuning pre-trained model parameters. Extensive experimental results on
applications like image generation, image translation, text-to-image
generation, image inpainting, and text-guided image editing suggest the
effectiveness and superiority of our proposed framework.

explaining a prediction model. For improving the interpretability, reducing the

environments, drone control programs typically provide configurable control
parameters. However, such a flexibility introduces vulnerabilities. One such
vulnerability, referred to as range specification bugs, has been recently
identified. The vulnerability originates from the fact that even though each
individual parameter receives a value in the recommended value range, certain
combinations of parameter values may affect the drone physical stability. In
this paper we develop a novel learning-guided search system to find such
combinations, that we refer to as incorrect configurations. Our system applies
metaheuristic search algorithms mutating configurations to detect the
configuration parameters that have values driving the drone to unstable
physical states. To guide the mutations, our system leverages a machine
learning predictor as the fitness evaluator. Finally, by utilizing
multi-objective optimization, our system returns the feasible ranges based on
the mutation search results. Because in our system the mutations are guided by
a predictor, evaluating the parameter configurations does not require
realistic/simulation executions. Therefore, our system supports a comprehensive
and yet efficient detection of incorrect configurations. We have carried out an
experimental evaluation of our system. The evaluation results show that the
system successfully reports potentially incorrect configurations, of which over
85% lead to actual unstable physical states.

the present paper, we give a detailed study of these quantities to draw
definite conclusions. [Method]To carry forward our earlier idea, the energy
density functional of the momentum space of neutron star matter is converted to
the coordinate space in a local density approximation. This functional is again
used to derive the neutron star surface properties within the coherent density
fluctuation model using the weight function obtained from the density profile
of the neutron star using the recently developed G3 and widely used NL3 and
IU-FSU parameter sets in the context of relativistic mean-field formalism.
[Results] The systematic surface properties of the neutron star, such as
incompressibility, symmetry energy, slope parameter, and curvature coefficient,
is calculated. The volume and surface components of the total symmetry energy
are decomposed with the help of the $\kappa$ factor obtained from the volume to
surface ratio of the symmetry energies in the liquid drop limit of Danielewicz.
The magnitude of the computed surface quantities increases with the neutron

$S^{\rm star}$, slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}^{\rm star}$ and curvature
coefficient $K_{\rm sym}^{\rm star}$ of the neutron stars with different mass

deuteron, triton and their anti-particles in different centralities for
$^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 39$ GeV. The calculated
transverse momentum spectra of protons, deuterons, and tritons are comparable
to those of experimental data from the RHIC-STAR collaboration. Both
coalescence parameters $B_{2}$ for (anti-)deuteron and $B_{3}$ for triton
increase with the transverse momentum as well as the collision centrality, and
they are comparable with the measured values in experiments. The effect of
system size on the production of light nuclei is also investigated by $^{10}$B

nuclei increase with system size, while the values of coalescence parameters
present an opposite trend. It is interesting to see that the system size, as
well as the centrality dependence of $B_A$ ($A$ = 2, 3), falls into the same
group, which further demonstrates production probability of light nuclei is
proportional to the size of the fireball. Furthermore, we compare our

beam with spatial structures is also widely concerned due to its important
applications in lots of areas. We theoretically and experimentally investigate
the self-healing and transformation characteristics of obstructed structured
beams composed by incoherent or coherent superposition of multiple
Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes. We reveal that partially obstructed single HG mode
can recover itself or transfer to a lower order in the far-field. When the
obstacle retains one pair of edged bright spots of HG mode in each direction of
its two symmetry axes, the beam structure information (number of knot lines)
along each axis can be restored. Otherwise, it will be transferred to the
corresponding low-order HG mode or multi interference fringes in the far-field,
according to the interval of the two most edged remaining spots on each axis.
It's proved that the above effect is induced by the diffraction and
interference results of the partially retained light field. This principle is
also applicable to multi-eigenmodes composed beams with special customized
optical structures. Then the self-healing and transformation characteristics of
the partially obstructed HG modes composed structured beams are investigated.
It's found that the HG modes incoherently composed structured beams have a
strong ability to recover themselves in the far-field after occlusion. These
investigations can expand the applications of optical lattice structures of

avoids streets penetrating shared spaces and main routes with high probability

can be effectively found with an average of 10 % increment of route length with

socially acceptable and safe route with minimal interaction of different PMDs

shared spaces, mi-cro-mobility simulations are of prime usage for acceptable

pedestrian behavior. Social force model with calibration can imitate the
required behavior of PMDs in a pedestrian mix navigation scheme. Based on
calibrated models, simulations on shared space links and gate structures are
performed to assist policies related to deciding wait-ing and stopping time.
Also, based on simulated PMDs interaction with pedestri-ans, location data with

objects. However, real-scanned 3D point clouds are often incomplete, and it is
important to recover complete point clouds for downstream applications. Most
existing point cloud completion methods use Chamfer Distance (CD) loss for
training. The CD loss estimates correspondences between two point clouds by
searching nearest neighbors, which does not capture the overall point density
distribution on the generated shape, and therefore likely leads to non-uniform
point cloud generation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Point
Diffusion-Refinement (PDR) paradigm for point cloud completion. PDR consists of
a Conditional Generation Network (CGNet) and a ReFinement Network (RFNet). The
CGNet uses a conditional generative model called the denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate a coarse completion conditioned on the
partial observation. DDPM establishes a one-to-one pointwise mapping between
the generated point cloud and the uniform ground truth, and then optimizes the
mean squared error loss to realize uniform generation. The RFNet refines the
coarse output of the CGNet and further improves quality of the completed point
cloud. Furthermore, we develop a novel dual-path architecture for both
networks. The architecture can (1) effectively and efficiently extract
multi-level features from partially observed point clouds to guide completion,
and (2) accurately manipulate spatial locations of 3D points to obtain smooth
surfaces and sharp details. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark
datasets show that our PDR paradigm outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods for point cloud completion. Remarkably, with the help of the RFNet, we
can accelerate the iterative generation process of the DDPM by up to 50 times
without much performance drop.

Langlands program, their analytic properties interact directly, yet deeply with
the decomposition of parabolic induction locally and the residues of Eisenstein
series globally. Inspired by the profound Langlands-Shahidi theory,
Casselman-Shahidi conjectured that a certain normalization factor would govern
the singularity of intertwining operators for generic standard modules. Indeed,
motivated by the theory of theta correspondence, especially the Siegel-Weil
formula globally, and the composition problem of degenerate principal series
and the demand of a g.c.d. definition of standard $L$-functions in the
framework of the doubling method locally, an optimal normalization factor has
been determined for degenerate principal series of classical groups via the
theory of integrals on prehomogeneous vector spaces. Such a method seems
impossible to be generalized to work even in the setting of degenerate
generalized principal series, which are naturally involved in the recent
Cai-Friedberg-Ginzburg-Kaplan's generalized doubling method. To circumvent it,
we discover a new uniform argument that can answer the singularity problem of
intertwining operators for a large class of induced representations. As an
illustration, we prove the aforementioned Casselman-Shahidi conjecture for
quasi-split groups of classical type in the paper. Along the way, with the help
of Shahidi's local coefficient theory, we also prove that those normalized
intertwining operators are always non-zero, and provide a new one-sentence
proof of the standard module conjecture in the spirit of Casselman-Shahidi.

operations in conventional frequency-domain beamformers are typically
independently-defined and complex-valued, which result in two drawbacks: the
former does not fully utilize the advantage of end-to-end optimization, and the
latter may introduce numerical instability during the training phase. Motivated
by the recent success in end-to-end neural separation systems, in this paper we
propose time-domain real-valued generalized Wiener filter (TD-GWF), a linear
filter defined on a 2-D learnable real-valued signal transform. TD-GWF splits
the transformed representation into groups and performs an minimum mean-square

show how TD-GWF can be connected to conventional filter-and-sum beamformers
when certain signal transform and the number of groups are specified. Moreover,
given the recent success in the sequential neural beamforming frameworks, we
show how TD-GWF can be applied in such frameworks to perform iterative
beamforming and separation to obtain an overall performance gain. Comprehensive
experiment results show that TD-GWF performs consistently better than
conventional frequency-domain beamformers in the sequential neural beamforming

human-region priority and group-level consistency. The lookup table-based
method achieves promising retouching performance by learning image-adaptive
weights to combine 3-dimensional lookup tables (3D LUTs) and conducting
pixel-to-pixel color transformation. However, this paradigm ignores the local
context cues and applies the same transformation to portrait pixels and
background pixels when they exhibit the same raw RGB values. In contrast, an
expert usually conducts different operations to adjust the color temperatures
and tones of portrait regions and background regions. This inspires us to model
local context cues to improve the retouching quality explicitly. Firstly, we
consider an image patch and predict pixel-adaptive lookup table weights to
precisely retouch the center pixel. Secondly, as neighboring pixels exhibit
different affinities to the center pixel, we estimate a local attention mask to
modulate the influence of neighboring pixels. Thirdly, the quality of the local
attention mask can be further improved by applying supervision, which is based
on the affinity map calculated by the groundtruth portrait mask. As for
group-level consistency, we propose to directly constrain the variance of mean

model, we ask ourselves what is the ``best'' convex regularizer to perform its
recovery. To answer this question, we define an optimal regularizer as a
function that maximizes a compliance measure with respect to the model. We
introduce and study several notions of compliance. We give analytical
expressions for compliance measures based on the best-known recovery guarantees
with the restricted isometry property. These expressions permit to show the
optimality of the ${\ell}$1-norm for sparse recovery and of the nuclear norm
for low-rank matrix recovery for these compliance measures. We also investigate
the construction of an optimal convex regularizer using the examples of
sparsity in levels and of sparse plus low-rank models.

the sufficiency of regional medical resources during health policy design.
However, patient choices can be the result of the complex interactivity of
various factors. The aim of this study is to propose a deep neural network
approach to model the complex decision of patient choice in travel distance to
access care, which is an important indicator for policymaking in allocating
resources. Method: We used the 4-year nationwide insurance data of Taiwan and
accumulated the possible features discussed in earlier literature. This study
proposes the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to
make predictions. The model performance was tested against other machine
learning methods. The proposed framework was further interpreted using
Integrated Gradients (IG) to analyze the feature weights. Results: We
successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of using a CNN-based framework to
predict the travel distance of patients, achieving an accuracy of 0.968, AUC of
0.969, sensitivity of 0.960, and specificity of 0.989. The CNN-based framework
outperformed all other methods. In this research, the IG weights are
potentially explainable; however, the relationship does not correspond to known
indicators in public health, similar to common consensus. Conclusions: Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of the deep learning-based travel distance
prediction model. It has the potential to guide policymaking in resource
allocation.

systems of agents need to communicate in order to pursue some collective task.
In particular, many biologically inspired systems that try to achieve
agreements on some opinion must implement resilient dynamics that are not
strongly affected by noisy communications. In this work, we study the popular
3-Majority dynamics, an opinion dynamics which has been proved to be an
efficient protocol for the majority consensus problem, in which we introduce a
simple feature of uniform communication noise, following (d'Amore et al. 2020).
We prove that in the fully connected communication network of n agents and in
the binary opinion case, the process induced by the 3-Majority dynamics
exhibits a phase transition. For a noise probability $p < 1/3$, the dynamics
reaches in logarithmic time an almost-consensus metastable phase which lasts
for a polynomial number of rounds with high probability. Furthermore, departing
from previous analyses, we further characterize this phase by showing that
there exists an attractive equilibrium value $s_{\text{eq}} \in [n]$ for the
bias of the system, i.e. the difference between the majority community size and
the minority one. Moreover, the agreement opinion turns out to be the initial
majority one if the bias towards it is of magnitude $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ in
the initial configuration. If, instead, $p > 1/3$, no form of consensus is
possible, and any information regarding the initial majority opinion is lost in
logarithmic time with high probability. Despite more communications per-round
are allowed, the 3-Majority dynamics surprisingly turns out to be less
resilient to noise than the Undecided-State dynamics (d'Amore et al. 2020),
whose noise threshold value is $p = 1/2$.

  Our algorithms arise from a new framework that provides a general blueprint
for modifying convex relaxations for robust estimation to satisfy strong
worst-case stability guarantees in the appropriate parameter norms whenever the
algorithms produce witnesses of correctness in their run. We verify such
guarantees for a modification of standard sum-of-squares (SoS) semidefinite

obtained by combining stability guarantees with a new ""estimate dependent""
noise injection mechanism in which noise scales with the eigenvalues of the
estimated covariance. We believe this framework will be useful more generally
in obtaining DP counterparts of robust estimators.

incorporate an object detection branch into an existing gaze prediction method.
However, previous gaze prediction methods usually use two different networks to
extract features from scene image and head image, which would lead to heavy
network architecture and prevent each branch from joint optimization. In this
paper, we build a novel framework named GaTector to tackle the gaze object
prediction problem in a unified way. Particularly, a specific-general-specific
(SGS) feature extractor is firstly proposed to utilize a shared backbone to
extract general features for both scene and head images. To better consider the
specificity of inputs and tasks, SGS introduces two input-specific blocks
before the shared backbone and three task-specific blocks after the shared
backbone. Specifically, a novel Defocus layer is designed to generate
object-specific features for the object detection task without losing

loss is introduced to guide the gaze heatmap to concentrate on the stared box.

expends enormous time. In this paper, we strive to liberate ViTs from

preserving their network architectures for higher upper bound and setting up
more suitable optimization objectives. To begin with, an agent CNN is designed
based on the given ViT with inductive biases. Then a bootstrapping training
algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the agent and ViT with weight
sharing, during which the ViT learns inductive biases from the intermediate

\textit{how do we discover the underlying DAG structure from decentralized

approximates the mechanisms among variables and personally updates on its own

overall learning task as a continuous optimization problem by taking advantage
of an equality acyclicity constraint, which can be solved by gradient descent
methods to boost the searching efficiency. Extensive experiments on both

soft lag of $\sim4.7$ ms is found at the sub-harmonic frequency. The increase
in the soft lags at the QPO frequencies with energy is also observed in other
black hole transients and is attributed to the inclination dependence of the
lags. The rms-energy spectra indicate the power-law component to be more
variable than the disk and the reflection components. We find a broad iron line

methods have been proposed. In this paper, we present the method of
spatio-temporal graph neural controlled differential equation (STG-NCDE).
Neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are a breakthrough concept for
processing sequential data. We extend the concept and design two NCDEs: one for
the temporal processing and the other for the spatial processing. After that,
we combine them into a single framework. We conduct experiments with 6
benchmark datasets and 20 baselines. STG-NCDE shows the best accuracy in all
cases, outperforming all those 20 baselines by non-trivial margins.

gravitational-wave detectors might be impacted by correlated noise sources. A
well known example are the Schumann resonances, which are extensively studied
in the context of searches for a gravitational-wave background. Earlier work
has shown that a technique termed ""gravitational-wave geodesy"" can be used to
generically differentiate observations of a gravitational-wave background from
signals due to correlated terrestrial effects, requiring true observations to
be consistent with the known geometry of our detector network. The key result
of this test is a Bayes factor between the hypotheses that a candidate signal
is astrophysical or terrestrial in origin. Here, we further formalize the
geodesy test, mapping distributions of false-alarm and false-acceptance
probabilities to quantify the degree with which a given Bayes factor will boost
or diminish our confidence in an apparent detection of the gravitational-wave
background. To define the false alarm probability of a given Bayes factor, we
must have knowledge of our null hypothesis: the space of all possible
correlated terrestrial signals. Since we do not have this knowledge we instead
construct a generic space of smooth functions in the frequency domain using
Gaussian processes, which we tailor to be conservative. This enables us to use
draws from our Gaussian processes as a proxy for all possible non-astrophysical
signals. As a demonstration, we apply the tool to the SNR = 1.25 excess
observed for a 2/3-power law by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations during their
second observing run.

turns out, the associated critical exponent is related to the eigenvalues of a
certain Dirichlet problem on a spherical domain. An important underlying
question is to decide whether this asymptotic exponent is a (non-)rational
number, as this has important consequences on the algebraic nature of the
associated generating function. In this paper, we ask whether such an excursion
sequence might admit an asymptotic expansion with a first rational exponent and
a second non-rational exponent. While the current state of the art does not
give any access to such many-term expansions, we look at the associated
continuous problem, involving Brownian motion in cones. Our main result is to
prove that in dimension three, there exists a cone such that the heat kernel
(the continuous analogue of the excursion sequence) has the desired
rational/non-rational asymptotic property. Our techniques come from spectral

different viewpoints, even though the exact viewpoints are untold. This ability
is essential for humans to identify the same object while moving and to learn

similar ability. In this paper, we consider a novel problem of learning
compositional scene representations from multiple unspecified viewpoints
without using any supervision, and propose a deep generative model which
separates latent representations into a viewpoint-independent part and a
viewpoint-dependent part to solve this problem. To infer latent

formation episodes. Aims. We want to show here that both the FP and its
projections arise naturally from the combination of the Virial Theorem (VT) and
a new time-dependent relation, describing how luminosity and stellar velocity
dispersion change during galaxy evolution. This relation has the form of the
Faber-Jackson (FJ) relation but a different physical meaning: the new relation
is $L = L'_0(t) \sigma^{\beta(t)}$, where its coefficients $L'_0$ and $\beta$
are time-dependent and can vary considerably from object to object, at variance
with those obtained from the fit of the $L - \sigma$ plane. Methods. We derive
the equations of the FP and its projections as a function of $\beta$ and
$L'_0$, by combining the VT and the $L = L'_0(t) \sigma^{\beta(t)}$ law. Then,
from their combination we derive the expression of the FP as a function of
$\beta$ and the solutions for $\beta$ and $L'_0$. Results. We demonstrate that
the observed properties of ETGs in the FP and its projections can be understood
in terms of variations of $\beta$ and $L'_0$. These two parameters encrypt the
history of galaxy evolution across the cosmic epochs and determine the future
aspect of the FP and its projections. Using the solutions found for $\beta$ and
$L'_0$ for each galaxy at the present epoch, we derive the coefficients of the
FP (and FJ relation) and show that, the values of the coefficients coming form
the fit, obtained in the literature, originate from the average of the single
FP coefficients derived for each galaxy. In addition, we show that the
variations of beta naturally explain the curvature observed in the FP
projections and the correct position of the Zone of Exclusion.

Furthermore, these measures are not easily transferable to new environments. We
cast safe exploration as an offline meta-RL problem, where the objective is to
leverage examples of safe and unsafe behavior across a range of environments to
quickly adapt learned risk measures to a new environment with previously unseen
dynamics. We then propose MEta-learning for Safe Adaptation (MESA), an approach

recoil kicks eject one SMBH remnant from the central host galaxy. This
temporarily drives the galaxy off the $M_{\bullet}$-$\sigma_{\star}$ relation,
however the galaxy returns to the relation due to subsequent galaxy mergers,
which bring in new SMBHs. This showcases a possible mechanism contributing to
the observed scatter of the $M_{\bullet}$-$\sigma_{\star}$ relation. Finally,
we show that Pulsar Timing Arrays and LISA would be able to detect parts of the
GW signals from the SMBH mergers that occur during the $\sim 4\,\mathrm{Gyr}$

significant expressive power from the model to leverage rich spatial-temporal
knowledge and generate effective supervisory signals from large amounts of
unlabeled videos. However, existing methods fail to increase the temporal
diversity of unlabeled videos and ignore elaborately modeling multi-scale
temporal dependencies in an explicit way. To overcome these limitations, we
take advantage of the multi-scale temporal dependencies within videos and
proposes a novel video self-supervised learning framework named Temporal
Contrastive Graph Learning (TCGL), which jointly models the inter-snippet and
intra-snippet temporal dependencies for temporal representation learning with a
hybrid graph contrastive learning strategy. Specifically, a Spatial-Temporal
Knowledge Discovering (STKD) module is first introduced to extract
motion-enhanced spatial-temporal representations from videos based on the
frequency domain analysis of discrete cosine transform. To explicitly model
multi-scale temporal dependencies of unlabeled videos, our TCGL integrates the
prior knowledge about the frame and snippet orders into graph structures, i.e.,
the intra-/inter- snippet Temporal Contrastive Graphs (TCG). Then, specific
contrastive learning modules are designed to maximize the agreement between
nodes in different graph views. To generate supervisory signals for unlabeled
videos, we introduce an Adaptive Snippet Order Prediction (ASOP) module which
leverages the relational knowledge among video snippets to learn the global
context representation and recalibrate the channel-wise features adaptively.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our TCGL over the
state-of-the-art methods on large-scale action recognition and video retrieval

proposed to minimize the distribution divergence in a more gentle way. Third,
the Nearest Neighbors Mining (NNM) is proposed to further expand positive

shown to reduce the memory and runtime costs of storing, visualizing, and

Gaussian data for the two LIGO observatories with expected O4 sensitivity, we
demonstrate that there is a non-negligible opportunity to deliver pre-merger

issued at a nominal rate of one binary neutron star coalescence per year and

This results in random vector valued fixed-point (FP) equations in large
dimensional spaces, and our aim is to study their almost-sure solutions. An
underlying directed random graph defines the connections between various
components of the FP equations. Existence of an edge between nodes $i,j$
implies the $i$-th FP equation depends on the $j$-th component. We consider a
special case where any component of the FP equation depends upon an appropriate
aggregate of that of the random `neighbour' components. We obtain
finite-dimensional limit FP equations in a much smaller dimensional space,
whose solutions aid to approximate the solution of FP equations for almost all
realizations, as the number of nodes increases. We use Maximum theorem for
non-compact sets to prove this convergence.
  We apply the results to study systemic risk in an example financial network
with large number of heterogeneous entities. We utilized the simplified limit
system to analyse trends of default probability (probability that an entity
fails to clear its liabilities) and expected surplus (expected-revenue after
clearing liabilities) with varying degrees of interconnections between two
diverse groups. We illustrated the accuracy of the approximation using
exhaustive Monte-Carlo simulations.
  Our approach can be utilized for a variety of financial networks (and
others); the developed methodology provides approximate small-dimensional
solutions to large-dimensional FP equations that represent the clearing vectors

enhanced via mutual distillation, which involves one-to-one knowledge transfer
at each training step, making full use of the complementary information from
two inverse directions. Moreover, in order to deal with mathematical symbols in
diverse scales, an Attention Aggregation Module (AAM) is proposed to
effectively integrate multi-scale coverage attentions. Notably, in the
inference phase, given that the model already learns knowledge from two inverse
directions, we only use the L2R branch for inference, keeping the original
parameter size and inference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed approach achieves the recognition accuracy of 56.85 % on CROHME 2014,
52.92 % on CROHME 2016, and 53.96 % on CROHME 2019 without data augmentation

started. A heuristic way to address it is the construction of a graph-based

Probabilistic Roadmap is a commonly used method by the robotics community to
build a path for navigational mobile robot path planning. In this study, path
smoothening by arc fillets is proposed for mobile robot path planning after
obtaining the path from PRM in the presence of the obstacle. The proposed
method runs in two steps; the first one is generating the shortest path between
the initial state to one of the goal states in the obstacle presence
environment, wherein the PRM is used to construct a straight-lined path by
connecting the intermediate nodes. The second step is smoothening every corner
caused by node presence. Smoothening the corners with arc fillets ensures
smooth turns for the mobile robots. The suggested method has been simulated and
tested with different PRM features. Experiment results show that the
constructed path is not just providing smooth turning; it is also shorter and
quicker to finish for a robot while avoiding obstacles.

implemented by a Petri net $N$. Depending on the level of accuracy, there are
three ways how $N$ can implement $A$: an embedding, the least accurate
implementation, preserves only the diversity of states of $A$; a language
simulation already preserves exactly the language of $A$; a realization, the
most accurate implementation, realizes the behavior of $A$ exactly. However,
whatever the sought implementation, a corresponding net does not always exist.
In this case, it was suggested to modify the input behavior -- of course as
little as possible. Since transition systems consist of states, events and
edges, these components appear as a natural choice for modifications. In this
paper we show that the task of converting an unimplementable transition system
into an implementable one by removing as few states or events or edges as
possible is NP-complete -- regardless of what type of implementation we are
aiming for; we also show that the corresponding parameterized problems are
$W[2]$-hard, where the number of removed components is considered as the
parameter; finally, we show there is no $c$-approximation algorithm (with a
polynomial running time) for neither of these problems, for every constant

calibration for Planck scaling relations, exploiting the cosmological
constraining power of the SPT-SZ cluster catalog and its dedicated weak lensing
(WL) and X-ray follow-up observations. We build a new version of the Planck
cluster likelihood. In the $\nu \Lambda$CDM scenario, focusing on the mass
slope and mass bias of Planck scaling relations, we find $\alpha_{\text{SZ}} =
1.49_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$ and $(1-b)_{\text{SZ}} = 0.69_{-0.14}^{+0.07}$
respectively. The results for the mass slope show a $\sim 4 \, \sigma$
departure from the self-similar evolution, $\alpha_{\text{SZ}} \sim 1.8$. This
shift is mainly driven by the matter density value preferred by SPT data,
$\Omega_m = 0.30 \pm 0.03$, lower than the one obtained by Planck data alone,
$\Omega_m = 0.37_{-0.06}^{+0.02}$. The mass bias constraints are consistent
both with outcomes of hydrodynamical simulations and external WL calibrations,
$(1-b) \sim 0.8$, and with results required by the Planck cosmic microwave
background cosmology, $(1-b) \sim 0.6$. From this analysis, we obtain a new
catalog of Planck cluster masses $M_{500}$. We estimate the ratio between the
published Planck $M_{\text{SZ}}$ masses and our derived masses $M_{500}$, as a
""measured mass bias"", $(1-b)_M$. We analyse the mass, redshift and detection
noise dependence of $(1-b)_M$, finding an increasing trend towards high
redshift and low mass. These results mimic the effect of departure from
self-similarity in cluster evolution, showing different dependencies for the
low-mass high-mass, low-z high-z regimes.

Moreover, with the merits of cloud radio access network (C-RAN), small cell
base stations (SBSs) can be decomposed of a central small cell (CSC) and remote
small cells (RSCs). To achieve the coordination, the split medium access
control (MAC) based functional splitting is adopted with scheduler deployed at
CSCs and retransmission functions left at RSCs. However, limited fronthaul has
a compelling impact at RSCs due to requirements of user quality-of-service
(QoS). Accordingly, a traffic control-based user association and resource
allocation (TURA) scheme is proposed for a centralized resource management. To
deal with the infeasibility to control all RSCs by CSC, we propose a hybrid
controlled user and resource management (HARM) scheme. A CSC performs TURA for
RSCs to mitigate intra-group interference within localized C-RANs, whereas the
CSCs among separate C-RANs conduct cooperative resource competition (CRC) game
for alleviating inter-group interference. Based on regret-based learning
algorithm, the proposed schemes are analytically proved to reach the correlated
equilibrium (CE). Simulation results have validated the effect of traffic
control in TURA scheme and the convergence of CRC. Moreover, the comparison of
the proposed TURA, HARM, and CRC schemes with the benchmark is revealed. It is
observed that the TURA scheme outperforms the other schemes under ideal

two levels, namely, boundary level and proposal level, for generating
high-quality action proposals, thereby improving the performance of temporal
action detection. Specifically, we design the Multi-Path Temporal Context
Aggregation (MTCA) to achieve smooth context aggregation on boundary level and
precise evaluation of boundaries. For matching evaluation, Coarse-to-fine
Matching (CFM) is designed to aggregate context on the proposal level and
refine the matching map from coarse to fine. We conduct extensive experiments
on ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS-14. DCAN obtains an average mAP of 35.39% on
ActivityNet v1.3 and reaches mAP 54.14% at IoU@0.5 on THUMOS-14, which
demonstrates DCAN can generate high-quality proposals and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. We release the code at

recognition, classification, and reconstruction tasks. Although very appealing
and valuable due to their predictive capabilities, one common threat remains
challenging to resolve. A specifically trained attacker can introduce malicious
input perturbations to fool the network, thus causing potentially harmful
mispredictions. Moreover, these attacks can succeed when the adversary has full
access to the target model (white-box) and even when such access is limited
(black-box setting). The ensemble of models can protect against such attacks
but might be brittle under shared vulnerabilities in its members (attack
transferability). To that end, this work proposes a novel diversity-promoting
learning approach for the deep ensembles. The idea is to promote saliency map
diversity (SMD) on ensemble members to prevent the attacker from targeting all
ensemble members at once by introducing an additional term in our learning
objective. During training, this helps us minimize the alignment between model
saliencies to reduce shared member vulnerabilities and, thus, increase ensemble
robustness to adversaries. We empirically show a reduced transferability
between ensemble members and improved performance compared to the
state-of-the-art ensemble defense against medium and high strength white-box
attacks. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach combined with existing
methods outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble algorithms for defense under
white-box and black-box attacks.

rising branches of the individual outbursts shows that the start of outbursts
of RU Peg can occur at various distances from the disc centre without
remarkable changes of the outburst recurrence time $T_{\rm C}$. The disc
overflow of the inflowing mass stream, varying with time, could contribute to
the changes in the starting position of the heating front, hence the variations
of the outburst types. A typical length of $T_{\rm C}$ was 90 days. The
segments of the relatively stable length of $T_{\rm C}$ were accompanied by the
primarily little variable and small values of the fluence (the energy radiated
in the optical band in the individual outbursts). Jumps of $T_{\rm C}$,
accompanied by the big scatter of the fluences, sometimes replaced them. In the
interpretation, a combination of variations of $T_{\rm C}$ with the unstable
properties of the outbursts, including an unstable mass transfer rate between

to manually optimizing CNN architectures and parametrizations. This would allow
developers of software solutions for computational pathology to focus efforts

recognition requires extensive biometric performance tests through large scale
data. However, using real face images raises concerns about privacy as the laws
do not allow the images to be used for other purposes than originally intended.
Using representative and subsets of face data can also lead to unwanted
demographic biases and cause an imbalance in datasets. One possible solution to
overcome these issues is to replace real face images with synthetically
generated samples. While generating synthetic images has benefited from recent
advancements in computer vision, generating multiple samples of the same
synthetic identity resembling real-world variations is still unaddressed, i.e.,
mated samples. This work proposes a non-deterministic method for generating
mated face images by exploiting the well-structured latent space of StyleGAN.
Mated samples are generated by manipulating latent vectors, and more precisely,
we exploit Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to define semantically meaningful
directions in the latent space and control the similarity between the original
and the mated samples using a pre-trained face recognition system. We create a
new dataset of synthetic face images (SymFace) consisting of 77,034 samples
including 25,919 synthetic IDs. Through our analysis using well-established
face image quality metrics, we demonstrate the differences in the biometric
quality of synthetic samples mimicking characteristics of real biometric data.
The analysis and results thereof indicate the use of synthetic samples created
using the proposed approach as a viable alternative to replacing real biometric
data.

traditional inference using dynamic programming (DP) typically works with a
small number of states (less than hundreds), which severely limits model
capacity. At the same time, across machine learning, there is a recent trend of
using randomized truncation techniques to accelerate computations involving
large sums. Here, we propose a family of randomized dynamic programming (RDP)
algorithms for scaling structured models to tens of thousands of latent states.
Our method is widely applicable to classical DP-based inference (partition,
marginal, reparameterization, entropy) and different graph structures (chains,
trees, and more general hypergraphs). It is also compatible with automatic
differentiation: it can be integrated with neural networks seamlessly and
learned with gradient-based optimizers. Our core technique approximates the
sum-product by restricting and reweighting DP on a small subset of nodes, which
reduces computation by orders of magnitude. We further achieve low bias and
variance via Rao-Blackwellization and importance sampling. Experiments over
different graphs demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach.

baselines and successfully prevent posterior collapse. code at:

distinguished type of CSs and should not be mixed up with so-called

electron-to-ion bulk speed ratio Ue/Ui increases. Theoretical predictions and
high-resolution observations from the MMS mission suggest that strong
electron-dominated CSs can be seen at ion scales. Therefore, we suggest that
applying the Ue/Ui parameter to the solar wind data may allow locating the
strongest electron-dominated CSs with an ordinary spacecraft resolution of
one-three seconds at least approximately. The results show that, indeed, an
impact of electron-dominated CSs on the plasma observed during a period of
quiet solar wind conditions at 1 AU may be associated with sharp changes in
Ue/Ui. Electron-dominated CSs are found to be localized in the vicinity of
ion-dominated CSs identified via changes in the magnetic field and plasma

models of artificial general intelligence to quantum environments. The utility
function of a classical exploratory stochastic Knowledge Seeking Agent, KL-KSA,
is generalized to distance measures from quantum information theory on density
matrices. Quantum process tomography (QPT) algorithms form the tractable subset
of programs for modeling environmental dynamics. The optimal QPT policy is
selected based on a mutable cost function based on algorithmic complexity as
well as computational resource complexity. Instead of Turing machines, we
estimate the cost metrics on a high-level language to allow realistic
experimentation. The entire agent design is encapsulated in a self-replicating
quine which mutates the cost function based on the predictive value of the
optimal policy choosing scheme. Thus, multiple agents with pareto-optimal QPT
policies evolve using genetic programming, mimicking the development of
physical theories each with different resource trade-offs. This formal
framework is termed Quantum Knowledge Seeking Agent (QKSA).
  Despite its importance, few quantum reinforcement learning models exist in
contrast to the current thrust in quantum machine learning. QKSA is the first
proposal for a framework that resembles the classical URL models. Similar to
how AIXI-tl is a resource-bounded active version of Solomonoff universal
induction, QKSA is a resource-bounded participatory observer framework to the
recently proposed algorithmic information-based reconstruction of quantum

information theory. Specifically, we demonstrate that it can be used to
accelerate quantum variational algorithms which include tomographic

Numerous architectures have been proposed for different data structures but
when it comes to the loss function, the cross-entropy loss is the predominant
choice. Recently, several alternative losses have seen revived interests for
deep classifiers. In particular, empirical evidence seems to promote square
loss but a theoretical justification is still lacking. In this work, we
contribute to the theoretical understanding of square loss in classification by
systematically investigating how it performs for overparametrized neural
networks in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. Interesting properties
regarding the generalization error, robustness, and calibration error are
revealed. We consider two cases, according to whether classes are separable or
not. In the general non-separable case, fast convergence rate is established
for both misclassification rate and calibration error. When classes are
separable, the misclassification rate improves to be exponentially fast.
Further, the resulting margin is proven to be lower bounded away from zero,
providing theoretical guarantees for robustness. We expect our findings to hold
beyond the NTK regime and translate to practical settings. To this end, we
conduct extensive empirical studies on practical neural networks, demonstrating
the effectiveness of square loss in both synthetic low-dimensional data and
real image data. Comparing to cross-entropy, square loss has comparable
generalization error but noticeable advantages in robustness and model
calibration.

underlying application. We show that transient hardware faults of GPUs can be
generated by exploiting the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)
technology, and these faults may cause computation errors, but they have
limited impact on the inference accuracy of DNN due to the robustness and
fault-tolerant nature of well-developed DNN models. To take full advantage of
these transient hardware faults, we propose the Lightning attack to locate the
fault injection targets of DNNs and to control the fault injection precision in
terms of timing and position. We conduct experiments on three commodity GPUs to
attack four widely-used DNNs. Experimental results show that the proposed
attack can reduce the inference accuracy of the models by as high as 78.3\% and
64.5\% on average. More importantly, 67.9\% of the targeted attacks have
successfully misled the models to give our desired incorrect inference result.
This demonstrates that the secure isolation on GPU clouds is vulnerable against
transient hardware faults and the computation results may not be trusted.

domain but with much fewer interactions. It is critical to learn a user's
preference from the source domain and transfer it into the target domain,
especially on the newly arriving contents with limited user feedback. To bridge
this gap, we propose a self-trained Cross-dOmain User Preference LEarning
(COUPLE) framework, targeting cold-start recommendation with various semantic
tags, such as attributes of items or genres of videos. More specifically, we
consider three levels of preferences, including user history, user content and
user group to provide reliable recommendation. With user history represented by
a domain-aware sequential model, a frequency encoder is applied to the
underlying tags for user content preference learning. Then, a hierarchical
memory tree with orthogonal node representation is proposed to further
generalize user group preference across domains. The whole framework updates in
a contrastive way with a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue to obtain more
distinctive representations. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate
the efficiency of COUPLE in both user and content cold-start situations. By
deploying an online A/B test for a week, we show that the Click-Through-Rate

failure modes of SF-2DNMs are demonstrated with this model. The Young's modulus

The magnetic signals are much weaker for the (110) and negligible for the (111)

moving charges is carried out, considering the EM action to propagate at the
speed of light. Through the altering of the Li\'enard-Wiechert potential (LWP)
a new retarded, electric potential called retarded Coulomb potential (RCP) is
ordered to the moving charges. RCP depends on the velocities both of the
interacting charges. The force law of the electric interaction of moving
charges is determined by means of the second order approximation of RCP. The
force law obtained is the Galilean invariant Webers force law, surprisingly.
The rediscovery of the Webers force law from a retarded electric potential
confirms its significance and proves it to be an approximated law, based on

generalization aims to generalize well to arbitrary unseen target domains

target domain is not available during training, previous methods inevitably
suffer from overfitting in source domains. To tackle this issue, we develop an
effective dropout-based framework to enlarge the region of the model's
attention, which can effectively mitigate the overfitting problem.
Particularly, different from the typical dropout scheme, which normally
conducts the dropout on the fixed layer, first, we randomly select one layer,
and then we randomly select its channels to conduct dropout. Besides, we
leverage the progressive scheme to add the ratio of the dropout during
training, which can gradually boost the difficulty of training model to enhance
the robustness of the model. Moreover, to further alleviate the impact of the
overfitting issue, we leverage the augmentation schemes on image-level and
feature-level to yield a strong baseline model. We conduct extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, which show our method can
outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

study of mode degeneracies, i.e. exceptional points, has led to the discovery
of intriguing and counterintuitive phenomena. Degeneracies are typically
modeled through the coupled mode theory to determine the behaviour of
eigenstates and eigenvalues. However, the complex nature of the eigenvalues
makes hard their direct characterization from the response spectrum. Here, we
demonstrate that a coherent interferometric excitation allows estimating both
the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues. We studied the clockwise and
counter-clockwise modes in an optical microresonators both in the case of
Hermitian and non-Hermitian intermodal coupling. We show the conditions by
which a resonant doublet, due to the dissipative coupling of
counter-propagating modes caused by surface roughness backscattering, merges to
a single Lorentzian. This permits to estimate the optimal quality factor of the
microresonator in the absence of modal coupling caused by backscattering.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that a taiji microresonator working at an
exceptional point shows a degeneracy splitting only in one propagation
direction and not in the other. This follows from the strongly non-Hermitian
intermodal coupling caused by the inner S-shaped waveguide.

set of large $N$-body simulations -- the ELEPHANT suite. We consider two
popular beyond-general relativity scenarios: the Hu-Sawicki chameleon $f(R)$
model and the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld (nDGP).
We show that in MG, analytic formulation based on the Press-Schechter framework
offers a grossly inaccurate description of the HMF. We find, however, that once
the HMF is expressed in terms of the dimensionless multiplicity function, it
approximately assumes a redshift-independent universal character for all the
models. Exploiting this property, we propose universal fits for the MG HMF in
terms of their fractional departures from the $\mathrm{\Lambda \text{CDM}}$
case. We find two enclosed formulas, one for $f(R)$ and another for nDGP, that
provide a reliable description of the HMF over the mass range covered by the
simulations. These are accurate to a few percent with respect to the $N$-body
data. We test the extrapolation potential of our fits against separate
simulations with a different cosmological background and mass resolution, and
find very good accuracy, within $\sim 10\%$. A particularly interesting finding
from our analysis is a Gaussian-like shape of the HMF deviation that seems to
appear universally across the whole $f(R)$ family, peaking at a mass variance
scale characteristic for each $f(R)$ variant. We attribute this behavior to the
specific physics of the environmentally-dependent chameleon screening models.

hypothetical or treatment policy strategies, respectively, for different types
of ICEs seem most appropriate in this context. Several estimators based on

candidate pulsating eclipsing binary system V948\,Her. TESS data were used for
the binary modelling with the literature radial velocity measurements and the

solar cell can be utilized via the up-conversion (UC) of two or more photons,
resulting in the emission of a single above-bandgap photon. Due to the
non-linear nature of UC, highly concentrated light is required, which is
typically much greater than the practical concentration limits of a solar cell.
It has been proposed that concentrating up-conversion solar cells (UC-SC) with
optical elements integrated into the device could help realize the high solar
irradiance required. To avoid scattering problems arising from common UC
materials based on micro-crystalline powders, in this work concentrators are
investigated with mono-crystalline up-converters in silicon-based tandem
devices. An external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6% with 1493 nm infrared
illumination at $876 W/m^2$ was obtained in upconverter device with concave
integrated optics. At an irradiance higher than $90 W/m^2$ (equivalent to 2.95x
in the 1450-1600 nm range), the non-concentrating UC-SC exhibited 1.5x higher
EQE than the UC-SC with CPC, while below $90 W/m^2$ the CPC UC-SC exhibited
1.95x higher EQE than the non-concentrating reference device. Due to the
negligible scattering of the UC layer, the distribution of localized irradiance
is revealed along with its effect on the performance of devices. It is found
that irradiance is accumulated within the first 1 mm of the UC layer with peaks
at variable depths according to the concentrating scheme. These results suggest
ample space for improved up-conversion devices by using integrated optics.

For example,
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) implements the compression by factoring a

Orthonormality, however, inherently includes constraints that would induce
redundant degrees of freedom, preventing SVD from deeper compression and even
making it frustrated as the data fidelity is strictly required. In this paper,
we theoretically prove that these redundancies resulted by orthonormality can
be completely eliminated in a lossless manner. An enhanced version of SVD,
namely E-SVD, is accordingly established to losslessly and quickly release
constraints and recover the orthonormal parts in SVD by avoiding multiple
matrix multiplications. According to the theory, advantages of E-SVD over SVD
become increasingly evident with the rising requirement of data fidelity. In
particular, E-SVD will reduce 25% storage units as SVD reaches its limitation
and fails to compress data. Empirical evidences from typical scenarios of
remote sensing and Internet of things further justify our theory and
consistently demonstrate the superiority of E-SVD in compression. The presented

desires. We refer to such objects as programmable instrument devices (PIDs),

important class of PIDs are those that do not require quantum memory to
implement, and these are naturally ""free"" in this resource theory. The
traditional notion of measurement incompatibility emerges as a resource in this
theory since any PID controlling an incompatible family of instruments requires
quantum memory to build. We identify an incompatibility partial ordering of
PIDs based on whether one can be transformed into another using processes that
do not require additional quantum memory. Necessary and sufficient conditions
are derived for when such transformations are possible based on how well
certain guessing games can be played using a given PID. Ultimately our results
provide an operational characterization of incompatibility, and they offer
device-independent tests for incompatibility in the most general types of
quantum instruments. Since channel steerability is equivalent to PID
incompatibility, this work can also be seen as a resource theory of channel
steering.

clean probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. Recently, the Canadian
Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) published a first catalog of 536
FRBs, 62 of which are from repeating sources. In light of this new data, we
re-examine the prospects to constrain the abundance of PBHs via FRBs. Extending
previous forecasts, we calculate a PBH dark matter bound using the intrinsic
burst width and a calibrated flux-ratio threshold per FRB. In addition, we take
into account the uncertainty in the relation between the FRB dispersion measure
and source redshift. We outline an algorithm to detect lensed FRBs and a method
to simulate its performance on real data and set a flux-ratio threshold for
each event, which we use to infer realistic forecasts. We then attempt to
extract a preliminary bound using the publicly available CHIME data.
Unfortunately, both instrumental noise and the provided ~1 ms time-resolution
of the public data hinder this effort. We identify one candidate event where a
double burst could be explained via strong lensing by a 10 solar-mass PBH,
which will require follow-up study at higher time resolution to either confirm
or discard. We show that with a few times the size of the first catalog --
sampled at the full instrumental time-resolution so that candidates can be
efficiently scrutinized -- CHIME will be able to find strong evidence for or
robustly rule out PBHs with mass above 10 solar masses as the dark matter.
Finally, we demonstrate that stacking repeating FRBs can improve the
constraints, especially for lower masses.

Apertif Imaging Survey is to perform a wide survey of 3500 square degrees

hydrogen (up to a redshift of 0.26), radio continuum emission and polarisation.
Each survey pointing yields 4.6 TB of correlated data. The goal of Apercal is
to process this data and fully automatically generate science ready data
products for the astronomical community while keeping up with the survey
observations. We make use of common astronomical software packages in
combination with Python based routines and parallelisation. We use an object
oriented module-based approach to ensure easy adaptation of the pipeline. A
Jupyter notebook based framework allows user interaction and execution of
individual modules as well as a full automatic processing of a complete survey

learners keep adding new nodes to the tree but never remove old ones increasing
the memory consumption over time. Gradient-based tree learning, on the other
hand, requires the computation of gradients over the entire tree which is
costly for even moderately sized trees. In this paper, we propose a novel
memory-efficient online classification ensemble called shrub ensembles for
resource-constraint systems. Our algorithm trains small to medium-sized
decision trees on small windows and uses stochastic proximal gradient descent
to learn the ensemble weights of these `shrubs'. We provide a theoretical

of our approach in the online setting. In a series of 2~959 experiments on 12

begin by deriving the nonlinear governing equations for torsional Alfv\'en wave

Lare3d, which solves the full set of nonlinear MHD equations, to the outputs
from WiggleWave to detect nonlinear effects such as: the excitation of
magnetosonic waves by the Alfv\'en wave, self-interaction of the Alfv\'en wave
through coupling to the induced magnetosonic waves, and the formation of shock
waves higher in the atmosphere caused by the steepening of these compressive
perturbations. We suggest that the presence of these nonlinear effects in the
solar corona would lead to Alfv\'en wave heating that exceeds the expectation

receptive fields (RF) to compete with visual transformers and their attention
mechanism. In CNNs, RFs can simply be enlarged by increasing the convolution
kernel sizes. Yet the number of trainable parameters, which scales
quadratically with the kernel's size in the 2D case, rapidly becomes
prohibitive, and the training is notoriously difficult. This paper presents a
new method to increase the RF size without increasing the number of parameters.
The dilated convolution (DC) has already been proposed for the same purpose. DC
can be seen as a convolution with a kernel that contains only a few non-zero
elements placed on a regular grid. Here we present a new version of the DC in
which the spacings between the non-zero elements, or equivalently their
positions, are no longer fixed but learnable via backpropagation thanks to an
interpolation technique. We call this method ""Dilated Convolution with
Learnable Spacings"" (DCLS) and generalize it to the n-dimensional convolution
case. However, our main focus here will be on the 2D case. We first tried our
approach on ResNet50: we drop-in replaced the standard convolutions with DCLS
ones, which increased the accuracy of ImageNet1k classification at
iso-parameters, but at the expense of the throughput. Next, we used the recent
ConvNeXt state-of-the-art convolutional architecture and drop-in replaced the
depthwise convolutions with DCLS ones. This not only increased the accuracy of
ImageNet1k classification but also of typical downstream and robustness tasks,
again at iso-parameters but this time with negligible cost on throughput, as
ConvNeXt uses separable convolutions. Conversely, classic DC led to poor
performance with both ResNet50 and ConvNeXt. The code of the method is

applications to algorithms. Classical algorithms that solve the spatial search

on quantum walks and the computational complexity is determined not only by the

However, in some modern optical communication systems where the transmitted

probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) with finite-length sphere shaping,
the kurtosis-based EGN model produces significant inaccuracies in analytical

a new one-way quantum finite automata (1QFA) model that integrates quantum
finite automata (QFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA). This model uses
classical states to control the evolution and measurement of quantum states. As
a quantum-classical hybrid model, 1QFAC recognize all regular languages. It was
shown that the state complexity of 1QFAC for some languages is essentially
superior to that of DFA and other 1QFA. In this paper, our goal is to clarify
state complexity problems for 1QFAC. We obtain the following results: (1) We
optimize the bound given by Qiu et al. that characterizes the relationship
between quantum basis state number and classical state number of 1QFAC as well
as the state number of its corresponding minimal DFA for recognizing any given
regular language. (2) We give an upper bound showing that how many classical
states are needed if the quantum basis states of 1QFAC are reduced without
changing its recognition ability. (3) We give a lower bound of the classical
state number of 1QFAC for recognizing any given regular language, and the lower
bound is exact if the given language is finite. (4) We show that 1QFAC are
exponentially more succinct than DFA and probabilistic finite automata (PFA)
for recognizing some regular languages that can not be recognized by
measure-once 1QFA (MO-1QFA), measure-many 1QFA (MM-1QFA) or multi-letter 1QFA.

both the circular dichroism (CD) response and the dissymmetry factor, g,

obtained in the case of a Parity-Time (PT) symmetric gain-loss bilayer, while
deviations from the exact PT symmetry lead to only moderate deterioration of

relationship with the fundamental forces acting on them. As we will describe in
detail, the distribution of the observed structures in the Universe is not
completely random, but it reflects the intimate features of the involved
particles and the nature of the fundamental interactions at play. The observed
structures cluster in restricted regions of the mass-radius diagram linked to
known particles, with the remarkable exception of very large structures that

successful in relatively static and known operating environments. However, when
an accurate model of the robot is not available, model-based design can lead to
suboptimal and even unsafe behaviour. In this work, we propose a method that
bridges the model-reality gap and enables the application of model-based
approaches even if dynamic uncertainties are present. In particular, we present
a learning-based model reference adaptation approach that makes a robot system,
with possibly uncertain dynamics, behave as a predefined reference model. In
turn, the reference model can be used for model-based controller design. In
contrast to typical model reference adaptation control approaches, we leverage
the representative power of neural networks to capture highly nonlinear
dynamics uncertainties and guarantee stability by encoding a certifying
Lipschitz condition in the architectural design of a special type of neural
network called the Lipschitz network. Our approach applies to a general class
of nonlinear control-affine systems even when our prior knowledge about the
true robot system is limited. We demonstrate our approach in flying inverted

technologies, has inspired a widespread of research activities, most of which
focused on 2-dimensional qubit states. Multilevel systems, qudits, promise to
upgrade and inspire new technical developments in high-dimensional Hilbert
space. Whereas, for high-dimensional teleportation, it routinely necessitates
several ancillary photons in linear optical schemes. A fundamental open
challenge remains as to whether we can teleport qudit states with bipartite
entanglement only. Here we demonstrate such a high-dimensional teleportation
using photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM). The so-called ""perfect vortices""
are exploited both for conducting the prerequisite entanglement concentration
to prepare high-dimensional yet maximal OAM entanglement, and for performing
faithful high-dimensional Bell sate measurements (HDBSM) based on sum-frequency
generation. We experimentally achieve the average teleportation fidelity
0.8788$\pm$0.048 for a complete set of 3-dimensional mutually unbiased bases,
for instance, conditional on three specific HDBSM results. More importantly, we
succeed in realizing the first quantum teleportation of optical images by
exploring full transverse spatial entanglement. From the multi-pixel field of
view in the teleported images recorded by the ICCD camera, we estimate the
effective channel capacity up to \k{appa} > 100. Our scheme holds promise for

amount of data, and require careful monitoring to allow for cost-effective
preventative maintenance. In aerospace applications, returning all measured
data to ground is prohibitively expensive, often causing useful, high value,
data to be discarded. The ability to detect, prioritise, and return useful data
in real-time is therefore vital. This paper proposes that system output
measurements, described by a convolutional neural network model of normality,
are prioritised in real-time for the attention of preventative maintenance
decision makers.
  Due to the complexity of gas turbine engine time-varying behaviours, deriving
accurate physical models is difficult, and often leads to models with low
prediction accuracy and incompatibility with real-time execution. Data-driven
modelling is a desirable alternative producing high accuracy, asset specific
models without the need for derivation from first principles.
  We present a data-driven system for online detection and prioritisation of
anomalous data. Biased data assessment deriving from novel operating conditions
is avoided by uncertainty management integrated into the deep neural predictive
model. Testing is performed on real and synthetic data, showing sensitivity to
both real and synthetic faults. The system is capable of running in real-time
on low-power embedded hardware and is currently in deployment on the

assumption that nearly all the bosons condense into the lowest quantum state at
sufficiently low temperatures. Here we develop a generalized version of
Bogoliubov theory for the case of a driven-dissipative exciton-polariton
condensate with a large incoherent uncondensed component, or excitonic
reservoir. We argue that such a reservoir can consist of both excitonic
high-momentum polaritons and optically dark superpositions of excitons across
different optically active layers, such as multiple quantum wells in a
microcavity. In particular, we predict interconversion between the dark and
bright (light-coupled) excitonic states that can lead to a dynamical
equilibrium between the condensate and reservoir populations. We show that the
presence of the reservoir fundamentally modifies both the energy and the
amplitudes of the Bogoliubov quasiparticle excitations due to the
non-Galilean-invariant nature of polaritons. Our theoretical findings are
supported by our experiment, where we directly detect the Bogoliubov excitation
branches of an optically trapped polariton condensate in the high-density
regime. By analyzing the measured occupations of the excitation branches, we
extract the Bogoliubov amplitudes across a range of momenta and show that they
agree with our generalized theory.

discretizations of Riemannian, negative-curvature Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. On
such manifolds, diffusion is ballistic. Asymptotically, diffusion time is
soldered with a manifold coordinate and, consequently, the probability
distribution is governed by the wave equation on the corresponding Lorentzian
manifold of positive curvature, de Sitter space-time. With this asymptotic
Lorentzian picture, the original negative curvature of the Riemannian manifold
turns into a positive cosmological constant. The Lorentzian picture, however,
is valid only asymptotically and cannot be extrapolated back in coordinate
time. Before a certain epoch, coordinate time looses its meaning and the
universe is a negative-curvature Riemannian ""shuttlecock"" with ballistic
diffusion, thereby avoiding a big bang singularity. The so-called ""dimension at

systems with a much higher long-term mass transfer rate ($\gg 10^{-4} \rm

supplementing, informing, and extending the possibilities of AI models. We show
this by describing how QA can be integrated in the current prediction paradigm
of AI, assisting scientists in the process of selecting data, variables, and
model architectures. Furthermore, we argue that QA can be a part of novel
paradigms towards Human Centered AI. QA can support scientists and
practitioners in practical problem solving and situated model development. It
can also promote participatory design approaches, reveal understudied and
emerging issues in AI systems, and assist policy making.

  correction","12 pages, 13 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When storing encoded qubits, if single faults can be corrected and double
faults postselected against, logical errors only occur due to at least three
faults. At current noise rates, having to restart when two errors are detected
prevents very long-term storage, but this should not be an issue for low-depth
computations. We consider distance-four, efficient encodings of multiple qubits
into a modified planar patch of the $16$-qubit surface code. We simulate
postselected error correction for up to $12000$ rounds of parallel stabilizer
measurements, and subsequently estimate the cumulative probability of logical
error for up to twelve encoded qubits.
  Our results demonstrate a combination of low logical error rate and low
physical overhead. For example, the distance-four surface code, using
postselection, accumulates $25$ times less error than its distance-five
counterpart. For $six$ encoded qubits, a distance-four code using $25$ qubits
protects as well as the distance-five surface code using $246$ qubits.
  Hence distance-four codes, using postselection and in a planar geometry, are
qubit-efficient candidates for fault-tolerant, moderate-depth computations.

especially, foundations of quantum information theory. This notion is
characterized by the huge diversity of approaches and interpretations. One of
the strongest trends in contextual research is to identify contextuality with
violation of the Bell inequalities. We call this sort of contextuality {\it
Bell test contextuality} (BTC). In this note, we criticize the BTC-approach. It
can be compared with an attempt to identify the complex and theoretically
nontrivial notion of randomness with a test for randomness (or a batch of
tests, as the NIST-test). We advertize {\it Bohr contextuality} -- taking into
account all experimental conditions (context). In the simplest case, the
measurement context of an observable $A$ is reduced to joint measurement with a
compatible observable $B.$ The latter definition was originally considered by
Bell in relation to his inequality. We call it {\it joint measurement
contextuality} (JMC). Although JMC is based on the use of counterfactuals, by
considering it in the general Bohr's framework it is possible to handle JMC on
physical grounds. We suggest (similarly to randomness) to certify JMC in
experimental data with Bell tests, but only certify and not reduce.

quality control. However, classic robust design requires a lot of evaluations
for a single design target, while the results of these evaluations could not be
reused for a new target. To achieve a data-efficient robust design, we propose
Robust Inverse Design under Noise (RID-Noise), which can utilize existing noisy
data to train a conditional invertible neural network (cINN). Specifically, we
estimate the robustness of a design parameter by its predictability, measured
by the prediction error of a forward neural network. We also define a
sample-wise weight, which can be used in the maximum weighted likelihood
estimation of an inverse model based on a cINN. With the visual results from
experiments, we clearly justify how RID-Noise works by learning the

real-world benchmark tasks with noises confirm that our method is more

independently. A solution of MTL with conflicting objectives requires modelling
the trade-off among them which is generally beyond what a straight linear
combination can achieve. A theoretically principled and computationally
effective strategy is finding solutions which are not dominated by others as it
is addressed in the Pareto analysis. Multi-objective optimization problems
arising in the multi-task learning context have specific features and require
adhoc methods. The analysis of these features and the proposal of a new
computational approach represent the focus of this work. Multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can easily include the concept of dominance and
therefore the Pareto analysis. The major drawback of MOEAs is a low sample
efficiency with respect to function evaluations. The key reason for this
drawback is that most of the evolutionary approaches do not use models for
approximating the objective function. Bayesian Optimization takes a radically
different approach based on a surrogate model, such as a Gaussian Process. In
this thesis the solutions in the Input Space are represented as probability
distributions encapsulating the knowledge contained in the function
evaluations. In this space of probability distributions, endowed with the
metric given by the Wasserstein distance, a new algorithm MOEA/WST can be
designed in which the model is not directly on the objective function but in an
intermediate Information Space where the objects from the input space are
mapped into histograms. Computational results show that the sample efficiency
and the quality of the Pareto set provided by MOEA/WST are significantly better

time-delayed feedback on extreme events in a non-polynomial system with
velocity dependent potential. To begin, we investigate the effect of this
feedback on extreme events for four different values of the external forcing
parameter. Among these four values, in the absence of time-delayed feedback,
for two values, the system does not exhibit extreme events and for the other
two values, the system exhibits extreme events. On the introduction of
time-delayed feedback and varying the feedback strength, we found that extreme
events get suppressed as well as get induced. When the feedback is positive,
suppression occurs for a larger parameter region whereas in the case of
negative feedback it is restricted to the limited parameter region. We confirm
our results through Lyapunov exponents, probability density function of peaks,
$d_{max}$ plot and two parameter probability plot. Finally, we analyze the
changes in the overall dynamics of this system under the influence of
time-delayed feedback. We notice that complete suppression of chaos occurs in
the considered system for higher values of the time-delayed feedback.

trained operator manually interpreting data with the support of rudimentary
automation tools. Recently, many demonstrations of deep learning (DL)
techniques that address individual NDE tasks (data pre-processing, defect
detection, defect characterisation, and property measurement) have started to
emerge in the research community. These methods have the potential to offer
high flexibility, efficiency, and accuracy subject to the availability of
sufficient training data. Moreover, they enable the automation of complex
processes that span one or more NDE steps (e.g. detection, characterisation,
and sizing). There is, however, a lack of consensus on the direction and
requirements that these new methods should follow. These elements are critical
to help achieve automation of ultrasonic NDE driven by artificial intelligence
such that the research community, industry, and regulatory bodies embrace it.
This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of autonomous ultrasonic NDE enabled by
DL methodologies. The review is organised by the NDE tasks that are addressed
by means of DL approaches. Key remaining challenges for each task are noted.
Basic axiomatic principles for DL methods in NDE are identified based on the
literature review, relevant international regulations, and current industrial
needs. By placing DL methods in the context of general NDE automation levels,
this paper aims to provide a roadmap for future research and development in the
area.

result of the mutual interactions between their units. An interesting feature
of these systems is the presence of stable periodic behavior even when each
unit oscillates chaotically if in isolation. Surprisingly, the mechanism in
which the network interaction replaces chaos by periodicity is still poorly
understood. Here, we show that such an onset of regularity can occur via
replication of periodic windows. This phenomenon multiplies the stability
domains in the system parameter space, not only suppressing chaos but also
making the network less vulnerable to external disturbances such as shocks and
noise. Moreover, we observe that the network cluster synchronizes for the
parameters corresponding to the replica periodic windows. To confirm these
observations, we employ the formalism of the master stability function
demonstrating that the complete synchronized state is indeed transversally
unstable in the replica windows.

social Frohlich condensate and attract attention of other researchers (both
from physics and socio-political science) to the problem of modelling of
stability and order preservation in highly energetic society coupled with
social energy bath of high temperature. Design methodology approach: The model
of social Frohlich condensation and its analysis are based on the mathematical
formalism of quantum thermodynamics and field theory (applied outside of
physics). Findings: The presented quantum-like model provides the consistent
operational model of such complex socio-political phenomenon as Frohlich
condensation. Research limitations implications: The model of social Frohlich
condensation is heavily based on theory of open quantum systems. Its consistent
elaboration needs additional efforts. Practical implications: Evidence of such
phenomenon as social Frohlich condensation is demonstrated by stability of
modern informationally open societies. Social implications: Approaching the
state of Frohlich condensation is the powerful source of social stability.
Understanding its informational structure and origin may help to stabilize the
modern society. Originality value: Application of the quantum-like model of
Frohlich condensation in social and political sciences is really the novel and
original approach to mathematical modeling of social stability in society
exposed to powerful information radiation from mass-media and internet based
sources.
