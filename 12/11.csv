developed a circuit quantum electrodynamics probe that, in addition to
transition spectroscopy, measures the microwave susceptibility of different
states of a semiconductor nanowire weak link with a single dominant
(spin-degenerate) Andreev level. We found that the microwave susceptibility
does not exhibit a particle-hole symmetry, which we qualitatively explain as an
influence of Coulomb interaction. Moreover, our state-selective measurement
reveals a large, $\pi$-phase shifted contribution to the response common to all
many-body states which can be interpreted as arising from a phase-dependent
continuum in the superconducting density of states.

several other state-of-the-art and alternative channel-allocation algorithms.
The two proposed performance metrics are the capacity-based and the
utility-based context. In the first case, every unit of additional capacity is
regarded as beneficial for any tenant, independent of the already allocated
quantity, and the main measure is the total throughput of the system. In the
second case, we assume a minimal and maximal required capacity value for each
tenant, and consider the implied utility values accordingly. In addition to the
total system performance, we also analyze fairness and computational
requirements in both contexts. We conclude that at the cost of higher but still
plausible computational time, the fairness-enhanced version of the proposed
preallocation based combinatorial auction algorithm outperforms every other
considered method when one considers total system performance and fairness
simultaneously, and performs especially well in the utility context. Therefore,
the proposed algorithm may be regarded as candidate scheme for URLLC channel
allocation problems, where minimal and maximal capacity requirements have to be
considered.

often explained by implicit bias from the decision maker against disadvantaged

receives a noisy estimate of each candidate's quality, whose variance depends
on the candidate's group -- we argue that such differential variance is a key
feature of many selection problems. We analyze two notable settings: in the
first, the noise variances are unknown to the decision maker who simply picks
the candidates with the highest estimated quality independently of their group;
in the second, the variances are known and the decision maker picks candidates
having the highest expected quality given the noisy estimate. We show that both
baseline decision makers yield discrimination, although in opposite directions:
the first leads to underrepresentation of the low-variance group while the
second leads to underrepresentation of the high-variance group. We study the
effect on the selection utility of imposing a fairness mechanism that we term
the $\gamma$-rule (it is an extension of the classical four-fifths rule and it
also includes demographic parity). In the first setting (with unknown
variances), we prove that under mild conditions, imposing the $\gamma$-rule
increases the selection utility -- here there is no trade-off between fairness
and utility. In the second setting (with known variances), imposing the
$\gamma$-rule decreases the utility but we prove a bound on the utility loss
due to the fairness mechanism.

main benefits are that it is scalable and can be fully or partially non

which incorporates multi-level optimisation. The presented approach adapts
evolution strategies for evolving an ensemble model based on the bagging
technique, using genetic operators for optimising single anomaly detection
models, reducing the training dataset to speedup the search process and perform
non-gradient fine tuning. Multivariate anomaly detection as an unsupervised
learning task is the case study upon which the presented approach is tested.
Single model optimisation is based on mutation and crossover operators and is
focused on finding optimal window sizes, the number of layers, layer depths,
hyperparameters etc. to boost the anomaly detection scores of new and already
known models. The proposed framework and its protocol shows that it is possible
to find architecture within a reasonable time frame which can boost all well
known multivariate anomaly detection deep learning architectures. The work
concentrates on improvements to the multi-level neuroevolution approach for
anomaly detection. The main modifications are in the methods of mixing groups
and single model evolution, non-gradient fine tuning and a voting mechanism.
The presented framework can be used as an efficient learning network
architecture method for any different unsupervised task where autoencoder
architectures can be used. The tests were run on SWAT, WADI, MSL and SMAP

observations of edges or snapshots of graphs over time. In this work, we define
sequential motifs in trajectory data, which are small, directed, and
edge-weighted subgraphs corresponding to patterns in observed sequences. We
draw a connection between counting and analysis of sequential motifs and
Higher-Order Network (HON) models. We show that by mapping edges of a HON,
specifically a $k$th-order DeBruijn graph, to sequential motifs, we can count
and evaluate their importance in observed data. We test our methodology with
two datasets: (1) passengers navigating an airport network and (2) people
navigating the Wikipedia article network. We find that the most prevalent and
important sequential motifs correspond to intuitive patterns of traversal in
the real systems, and show empirically that the heterogeneity of edge weights
in an observed higher-order DeBruijn graph has implications for the
distributions of sequential motifs we expect to see across our null models.

problems of practical interest necessitates the development of hybrid

decomposition (BD) approach that exploits multiple feasible solutions of the
master problem (MP) to generate multiple valid cuts is adapted, so as to be
used as an HQC solver for general mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
problems. The use of different cut selection criteria and strategies to manage
the size of the MP by eliciting a subset of cuts to be added in each iteration
of the BD scheme using quantum computing is discussed. The HQC optimization
algorithm is applied to the Unit Commitment (UC) problem. UC is a prototypical
use case of optimization applied to electrical power systems, a critical sector
that may benefit from advances in quantum computing. The validity and
computational viability of the proposed approach are demonstrated using the

one uses available 2D floor plans to guide selection and deformation of 3D

them into novel layouts. We design a set of metrics that evaluate the generated

frequent wearing of masks. These masks affect the performance of previous face
recognition systems, as they hide important identity information. In this
paper, we propose a mask-invariant face recognition solution (MaskInv) that
utilizes template-level knowledge distillation within a training paradigm that
aims at producing embeddings of masked faces that are similar to those of
non-masked faces of the same identities. In addition to the distilled
knowledge, the student network benefits from additional guidance by
margin-based identity classification loss, ElasticFace, using masked and
non-masked faces. In a step-wise ablation study on two real masked face
databases and five mainstream databases with synthetic masks, we prove the
rationalization of our MaskInv approach. Our proposed solution outperforms
previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) academic solutions in the recent MFRC-21

also outperforms the previous solution on the MFR2 dataset. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the proposed model can still perform well on unmasked faces

for eccentric, equatorial (i.e., spin-aligned) motion in Kerr spacetime. The
forcing terms are provided by an efficient spectral interpolation of the
first-order gravitational self-force in the outgoing radiation gauge. We apply
a near-identity (averaging) transformation to eliminate all dependence of the
orbital phases from the equations of motion, while maintaining all secular
effects of the first-order gravitational self-force at post-adiabatic order.
This implies that the model can be evolved without having to resolve all
$\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ orbit cycles of an EMRI, yielding an inspiral model that
can be evaluated in less than a second for any mass-ratio. In the case of a
non-rotating central black hole, we compare inspirals evolved using self-force
data computed in the Lorenz and radiation gauges. We find that the two gauges
generally produce differing inspirals with a deviation of comparable magnitude

including the (currently unknown) dissipative second order self-force to obtain
gauge independent, post-adiabatic waveforms.

angles by tracking the hit locations in the detector layers on the sub-divided
uniform energy intervals through the GEANT4 simulations. In the latter step, we
express two misclassification probabilities where the first approach assumes a
symmetrical linear propagation bounded by one standard deviation in one
dimension, whereas the second procedure employs a positively defined modified
Gaussian distribution that governs the overlapping area in two dimensions. In
the final stage, we compare qualitatively and quantitatively the adjacent
energy groups by using the computed misclassification probabilities. In the
absence of any further data manipulation, we explicitly show that the
misclassification probabilities increase when the number of energy groups
augments. Furthermore, we also conclude that it is feasible to benefit from the
mean deflection angle to roughly estimate the muon energies up to four energy
groups by taking the misclassification probabilities into consideration, while
the classification viability significantly diminishes when the partition number

approached and obtain an exact analytical expression for the distribution of
the fluctuations $\Delta(t) = [R-M_x(t)]/R$ in the limit of large $t$ in all
dimensions. We find that the distribution of $\Delta(t)$ exhibits a rich
variety of behaviors depending on the dimension $d$. These results are obtained
by establishing a connection between this problem and the narrow escape time

trajectory of the particle in a disk of radius $R$ with reflecting boundaries.
We find that the mean perimeter $\langle L(t)\rangle$ of the convex hull
exhibits a slow convergence towards the perimeter of the circle $2\pi R$ with a

three sensor modalities, i.e., an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a
millimetre-wave (mmWave) radar, and a thermal infrared camera, and realise
their deep odometry inference engines which runs in real-time. A pipeline of
deploying deep odometry considering accuracy, complexity, and edge platform is
proposed. We design a LoRa link for positional data backhaul and projecting
aggregated positions of deep odometry into the global frame. We find that a
simple EKF based fusion module is sufficient for generic positioning
calibration with over 34% accuracy gains against any standalone deep odometry
system. Extensive tests in different environments validate the efficiency and
efficacy of our proposed positioning system.

further two variants are proposed by adding Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers respectively. All three network models have
consecutive fully connected layers before the final softmax layer for
classification. The ensemble model uses a weighted average to provide the final
classification. We have utilized five standard benchmark datasets: TESS,
EMO-DB, RAVDESS, SAVEE, and CREMA-D for evaluation. We have performed DA by
injecting Additive White Gaussian Noise, pitch shifting, and stretching the
signal level to generalize the models, and thus increasing the accuracy of the
models and reducing the overfitting as well. We handcrafted five categories of
features: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, Log Mel-Scaled Spectrogram,
Zero-Crossing Rate, Chromagram, and statistical Root Mean Square Energy value
from each audio sample. These features are used as the input to the LFAB blocks
that further extract the hidden local features which are then fed to either
fully connected layers or to LSTM or GRU based on the model type to acquire the
additional long-term contextual representations. LFAB followed by GRU or LSTM
results in better performance compared to the baseline model. The ensemble

World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a guideline for alcohol-based hand

these steps involve complex gestures, human assessment of them lacks enough
accuracy. However, Deep Neural Network (DNN) and machine vision have made it
possible to accurately evaluate hand rubbing quality for the purposes of

assessment system with real-time feedback is presented. The system evaluates
the compliance with the 8-step guideline using a DNN architecture trained on a
dataset of videos collected from volunteers with various skin tones and hand
characteristics following the hand rubbing guideline. Various DNN architectures
were tested, and an Inception-ResNet model led to the best results with 97%

for long simulation times $t_\text{max}$, with a cubic scaling of the
computation time with $t_\text{max}$. Truncation of the memory kernel can
reduce the computational cost to linear scaling with $t_\text{max}$, but the
required memory times will depend on the model and the diagrammatic
approximation to the self-energy. We explain how a truncation of the memory
kernel can be incorporated into the time-propagation algorithm to solve the
KBE, and investigate the systematic truncation of the memory kernel for the
Hubbard model in different parameter regimes, and for different diagrammatic
approximations. The truncation is easier to control within dynamical mean-field
solutions, where it is applied to a momentum-independent self-energy. Here,
simulation times up to two orders of magnitude longer are accessible both in

naturally out of the more fine-grained and flexible model, and (2) it suggests
new ways of using available data with SC methods for valid causal inference, in

use optimal control theory to pose the problem of transporting a slender drop

to move it with minimal viscous dissipation. By parametrizing the position and

uncover a natural ''gather-move-spread'' strategy that leads to an optimal

In the continuum setting, the competition between passive surface tension, and
active controls generates richer behaviour with futile oscillations and complex

rough in other regions, are modelled naturally in a Bayesian manner using
so-called Besov priors which are given by random wavelet expansions with
Laplace-distributed coefficients. This paper studies theoretical guarantees for
such prior measures - specifically, we examine their frequentist posterior
contraction rates in the setting of non-linear inverse problems with Gaussian
white noise. Our results are first derived under a general local Lipschitz
assumption on the forward map. We then verify the assumption for two non-linear
inverse problems arising from elliptic partial differential equations, the
Darcy flow model from geophysics as well as a model for the Schr\""odinger
equation appearing in tomography. In the course of the proofs, we also obtain
novel concentration inequalities for penalized least squares estimators with
$\ell^1$ wavelet penalty, which have a natural interpretation as maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimators. The true parameter is assumed to belong to some
spatially inhomogeneous Besov class $B^{\alpha}_{11}$, $\alpha>0$.
  In a setting with direct observations, we complement these upper bounds with
a lower bound on the rate of contraction for arbitrary Gaussian priors. An
immediate consequence of our results is that while Laplace priors can achieve
minimax-optimal rates over $B^{\alpha}_{11}$-classes, Gaussian priors are
limited to a (by a polynomial factor) slower contraction rate. This gives
information-theoretical justification for the intuition that Laplace priors are
more compatible with $\ell^1$ regularity structure in the underlying parameter.

the test performance of the task model used in AL. In this work, we explore
such an impact by theoretically proving that selecting unlabeled data of higher

test performance. However, due to the lack of label information, directly
computing gradient norm for unlabeled data is infeasible. To address this
challenge, we propose two schemes, namely expected-gradnorm and
entropy-gradnorm. The former computes the gradient norm by constructing an
expected empirical loss while the latter constructs an unsupervised loss with
entropy. Furthermore, we integrate the two schemes in a universal AL framework.
We evaluate our method on classical image classification and semantic
segmentation tasks. To demonstrate its competency in domain applications and
its robustness to noise, we also validate our method on a cellular imaging

Young integral constructed in the space of functions with finite $p$-variation,
which is well suited when $b$ is a nonnegative (or nonpositive) distribution.
Depending on $H$, a condition on the Besov regularity of $b$ is given so that

state-of-the-art quantum hardware. As a proof of principle demonstration
targeting the Anderson impurity model we close the DMFT loop with current noisy

resilient spectral analysis we observe a Mott phase transition. Based on a
Cartan decomposition, our algorithm gives a fixed depth, fast-forwarding,
quantum circuit that can evolve the initial state over arbitrarily long times

formulas such as Trotter decomposition. By exploiting the structure of the
fast-forwarding circuits we reduce the gate count (to 77 CNOTs after

otherwise dominate due to the long-time evolution required to resolve

wide range of applications - for instance, in astrophysics and remote sensing.
Classical sparse BSS methods, such as the Proximal Alternating Linearized
Minimization (PALM) algorithm, nevertheless often suffer from a difficult
hyperparameter choice, which undermines their results. To bypass this pitfall,
we propose in this work to build on the thriving field of algorithm
unfolding/unrolling. Unrolling PALM enables to leverage the data-driven
knowledge stemming from realistic simulations or ground-truth data by learning
both PALM hyperparameters and variables. In contrast to most existing unrolled
algorithms, which assume a fixed known dictionary during the training and
testing phases, this article further emphasizes on the ability to deal with
variable mixing matrices (a.k.a. dictionaries). The proposed Learned PALM
(LPALM) algorithm thus enables to perform semi-blind source separation, which
is key to increase the generalization of the learnt model in real-world
applications. We illustrate the relevance of LPALM in astrophysical
multispectral imaging: the algorithm not only needs up to $10^4-10^5$ times
fewer iterations than PALM, but also improves the separation quality, while
avoiding the cumbersome hyperparameter and initialization choice of PALM. We
further show that LPALM outperforms other unrolled source separation methods in
the semi-blind setting.

information to predict future events. These methods rely on historical labeled
data and cannot accurately predict events when data are limited or of poor

analysis and can contribute to a more robust prediction of events. However,
incorporating causality analysis in data-driven event forecasting is
challenging due to several factors: (i) Events occur in a complex and dynamic
social environment. Many unobserved variables, i.e., hidden confounders, affect
both potential causes and outcomes. (ii) Given spatiotemporal non-independent
and identically distributed (non-IID) data, modeling hidden confounders for
accurate causal effect estimation is not trivial. In this work, we introduce a
deep learning framework that integrates causal effect estimation into event
forecasting. We first study the problem of Individual Treatment Effect (ITE)
estimation from observational event data with spatiotemporal attributes and
present a novel causal inference model to estimate ITEs. We then incorporate
the learned event-related causal information into event prediction as prior
knowledge. Two robust learning modules, including a feature reweighting module
and an approximate constraint loss, are introduced to enable prior knowledge
injection. We evaluate the proposed causal inference model on real-world event
datasets and validate the effectiveness of proposed robust learning modules in
event prediction by feeding learned causal information into different deep

proposed causal inference model for ITE estimation in societal events and

Temperature and calorimetry were measured during the course of the experiments.
An interesting side effect of these measurements is that they served to spot

probability distributions. However, they do not provide a mechanism for
obtaining exact samples from these distributions. Monte Carlo techniques can
aid us in obtaining samples if some proposal distribution that we can easily
sample from is available. For instance, rejection sampling can provide exact
samples but is often difficult or impossible to apply due to the need to find a
proposal distribution that upper-bounds the target distribution everywhere.
Approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques like
Metropolis-Hastings are usually easier to design, exploiting a local proposal
distribution that performs local edits on an evolving sample. However, these
techniques can be inefficient due to the local nature of the proposal
distribution and do not provide an estimate of the quality of their samples. In
this work, we propose a new approximate sampling technique, Quasi Rejection
Sampling (QRS), that allows for a trade-off between sampling efficiency and
sampling quality, while providing explicit convergence bounds and diagnostics.
QRS capitalizes on the availability of high-quality global proposal
distributions obtained from deep learning models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of QRS sampling for discrete EBMs over text for the tasks of
controlled text generation with distributional constraints and paraphrase
generation. We show that we can sample from such EBMs with arbitrary precision

They aim to provide a pedagogical introduction and basic working knowledge of
single-field inflation including the ultra-slow-roll regime, where the
perturbations grow exponentially. This rapid growth is connected to the
formation of primordial black holes (PBHs), a special dark matter candidate and
probe of the initial conditions of the early universe. Although there are many
textbooks and introductory texts about inflation, to the best of our knowledge
there is no comparable introduction to ultra-slow-roll inflation. Furthermore,
given their recent surge in popularity, there are numerous research articles
and reviews on primordial black holes, however these notes aim to be more
accessible for graduate students and those brand new to the topic. Some
problems and solutions to primordial black hole-related calculations are also
included. The reader of these lecture notes should come away being able to
calculate the present-day abundance of primordial black holes produced from the
density fluctuations left over at the end of single-field inflation with an
ultra-slow-roll phase, and understand how this abundance compares with current

focusing due to the Sun induces modulations of dark matter signals on
terrestrial experiments. We consider the gravitational focusing of a light
bosonic dark matter with a mass of less than about 10 eV. The wave nature of
such dark matter candidates leads to unique signatures both in the local

We provide a formalism that captures both the gravitational focusing and the

density contrast and spectrum are observed when the de Broglie wavelength of
dark matter becomes comparable or less than the size of the system and/or when
the velocity dispersion of dark matter is sufficiently small. While
gravitational focusing effects generally remain at a few percent level for a
relaxed halo dark matter component, they could be much larger for dark matter
substructures. With a few well-motivated dark matter substructures, we

Wireless coexistence interfaces enable them to schedule packets without

performance. Today's hardwired coexistence interfaces hinder clear security
boundaries and separation between chips and chip components. This paper shows
practical coexistence attacks on Broadcom, Cypress, and Silicon Labs chips
deployed in billions of devices. For example, we demonstrate that a Bluetooth
chip can directly extract network passwords and manipulate traffic on a Wi-Fi
chip. Coexistence attacks enable a novel type of lateral privilege escalation
across chip boundaries. We responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to the

wireless chips would need to be redesigned from the ground up to prevent the

$x_i\in\Sigma$, $x_j\neq x_{j+1}$ and $d_i\geq 2$ for all $i$ in $[k]$ and $j$
in $[k-1]$. A linear time algorithm for computing the longest letter-duplicated
subsequence (LLDS) of $S$ can be easily obtained. In this paper, we focus on
two variants of this problem. We first consider the constrained version when
$\Sigma$ is unbounded, each letter appears in $S$ at least 6 times and all the
letters in $\Sigma$ must appear in the solution. We show that the problem is
NP-hard (a further twist indicates that the problem does not admit any
polynomial time approximation). The reduction is from possibly the simplest
version of SAT that is NP-complete, $(\leq 2,1,\leq 3)$-SAT, where each
variable appears at most twice positively and exact once negatively, and each
clause contains at most three literals and some clauses must contain exactly
two literals. (We hope that this technique will serve as a general tool to help
us proving the NP-hardness for some more tricky sequence problems involving
only one sequence -- much harder than with at least two input sequences, which
we apply successfully at the end of the paper on some extra variations of the
LLDS problem.) We then show that when each letter appears in $S$ at most 3
times, then the problem admits a factor $1.5-O(\frac{1}{n})$ approximation.
Finally, we consider the weighted version, where the weight of a block
$x_i^{d_i} (d_i\geq 2)$ could be any positive function which might not grow
with $d_i$. We give a non-trivial $O(n^2)$ time dynamic programming algorithm

$\log\Xi_0$ ($68\%$ C.L., maximum posterior and HDI), which only rely on the
presence of a feature in the BBH mass distribution around $\sim 30-45

an outlier of the population. We then study in more detail the effects of
modified GW propagation on population and cosmological analyses for LIGO/Virgo
at design sensitivity. For a given data-taking period, the relative error
$\Delta\Xi_0/\Xi_0$ has a significant dependence on the fiducial value of
$\Xi_0$, since the latter has a strong influence on the detection rate. For
five years of data, the accuracy ranges from $\sim 10\%$ on $\Xi_0$ when

required to interpret, analyze, and calibrate the results of automated

investigate anomalies in time series data in industrial contexts and identifies
corresponding needs. Through iterative design and working with nine experts
from two industry domains (aerospace and energy), we characterize six design
elements required for a successful visualization system that supports effective
detection, investigation, and annotation of time series anomalies. We summarize
an ideal human-AI collaboration workflow that streamlines the process and
supports efficient and collaborative analysis. We introduce MTV (Multivariate
Time Series Visualization), a visual analytics system to support such workflow.
The system incorporates a set of novel visualization and interaction designs to
support multi-faceted time series exploration, efficient in-situ anomaly
annotation, and insight communication. Two user studies, one with 6 spacecraft
experts (with routine anomaly analysis tasks) and one with 25 general end-users
(without such tasks), are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and

non-linearly decomposed into the leading constrained parameter combinations via
parallel transport in the metric space. We test our methods on two

spontaneous decay rates and forces included. As is well-known, the
Heaviside-Larmor duality symmetry of Maxwell's equations, where electric and

interaction energy. We argue that this symmetry can be restored by including
general local-field effects, and that local fields should be treated as a
necessity for correctly translating between the microscopic world of the dipole
and the macroscopic world of the measured fields. This may additionally aid in
resolving a long standing debate over the form of the force on a dipole in a

detections of black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) mergers requires comparing
observations with population synthesis predictions. In this work we investigate
the combined impact from the key uncertainties in population synthesis
modelling of the isolated binary evolution channel: the physical processes in
massive binary-star evolution and the star formation history as a function of
metallicity, $Z$, and redshift $z, \mathcal{S}(Z,z)$. Considering these
uncertainties we create 560 different publicly available model realizations and
calculate the rate and distribution characteristics of detectable BHBH, BHNS,
and NSNS mergers. We find that our stellar evolution and $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$
variations can impact the predicted intrinsic and detectable merger rates by
factors $10^2$-$10^4$. We find that BHBH rates are dominantly impacted by
$\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ variations, NSNS rates by stellar evolution variations and
BHNS rates by both. We then consider the combined impact from all uncertainties
considered in this work on the detectable mass distribution shapes (chirp mass,
individual masses and mass ratio). We find that the BHNS mass distributions are
predominantly impacted by massive binary-star evolution changes. For BHBH and
NSNS we find that both uncertainties are important. We also find that the shape
of the delay time and birth metallicity distributions are typically dominated
by the choice of $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ for BHBH, BHNS and NSNS. We identify
several examples of robust features in the mass distributions predicted by all
560 models, such that we expect more than 95% of BHBH detections to contain a
BH $\gtrsim 8\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and have mass ratios $\lesssim 4$. Our work
demonstrates that it is essential to consider a wide range of allowed models to
study double compact object merger rates and properties.

built from the Magneticum simulations. From the simulated catalogs, the ML
method estimates the amplitude of matter fluctuations, sigma_8, at

saliency for evaluating feature importance, and correlations in the terse layer
for understanding whether an ML technique can be safely applied to
observational data. These interpretation schemes led to the discovery of a
previously unknown self-calibration mode for flux- and volume-limited cluster

correlated electron system. Instead, in iron pnictides and in certain cuprates

spin-stripe or charge-stripe state. As a result, random strain, ubiquitous in
any real crystal, creates both random-field disorder for the nematic degrees of
freedom and random-bond disorder for the spin or charge ones. Here, we put
forward an Ashkin-Teller model with random Baxter fields to capture the dual
role of random strain in nematic systems for which nematicity is a composite
order arising from a stripe state. Using Monte Carlo to simulate this
$\textit{random Baxter-field model}$, we find not only the expected break-up of
the system into nematic domains, but also the emergence of nontrivial
disorder-promoted magnetic correlations. Such correlations enhance and tie up
the fluctuations associated with the two degenerate magnetic stripe states from
which nematicity arises, leaving characteristic signatures in the spatial
profile of the magnetic domains, in the configurational space of the spin
variables, and in the magnetic noise spectrum. We discuss possible experimental
manifestations of these effects in iron-pnictide superconductors. Our work
establishes the random Baxter-field model as a more complete alternative to the
random-field Ising model to describe complex electronic nematic phenomena in
the presence of disorder.

theoretically investigate the nonlinear electrodynamics of such striped

photoexcitation is converted into a shift current by a second-order optical
nonlinearity, which is activated by the breaking of inversion symmetry in
certain stripe configurations. While such a low-frequency current impulsively
drives both bulk and surface collective modes, we demonstrate that the observed
emission is dominated by oscillations of the surface Josephson plasmon.
Typically, surface excitations lie outside the light cone and are therefore
silent; however, they can become bright due to the Bragg scattering off the
charge order. We point out the importance of including Umklapp shift currents
modulated at the stripe periodicity itself, which impulsively drive surface
Josephson plasmons and lead to a resonant structure of outgoing radiation,
consistent with the experiments.

with them. As each star is likely to contribute at least $10^{12}$ interstellar
objects, the Galaxy's drifting population of interstellar objects (ISOs)
provides an overview of the properties of its stellar population through time.
Using the EAGLE cosmological simulation and models of protoplanetary formation,
our modelling predicts an ISO population with a bimodal distribution in their
water mass fraction. Objects formed in low-metallicity, typically older,
systems have a higher water fraction than their counterparts formed in
high-metallicity protoplanetary disks, and these water-rich objects comprise
the majority of the population. Both detected ISOs seem to belong to the lower
water fraction population; these results suggest they come from recently formed
systems. We show that the population of ISOs in galaxies with different star
formation histories will have different proportions of objects with high and
low water fractions. This work suggests that it is possible that the upcoming
Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time will detect a large
enough population of ISOs to place useful constraints on models of

convex cone -- normalized into the first quadrant -- has received a lot of
attention, stimulated the development of several original approaches, and led
to a rich collection of results. Most of them deal with the nature of the
associated generating function: for which models is it algebraic, D-finite,
D-algebraic? By model, what we mean is a finite collection of allowed steps.
  More recently, similar questions have been raised for non-convex cones,
typically the three-quadrant cone $C = \{ (i,j) : i \geq 0 \text{ or } j \geq 0
\}$. They turn out to be more difficult than their quadrant counterparts. In
this paper, we investigate a collection of eight models in $C$. This collection
consists of diagonally symmetric models in $\{-1, 0,1\}^2\setminus\{(-1,1),
(1,-1)\}$. Three of them are known not to be D-algebraic. We show that the
remaining five can be solved in a uniform fashion using Tutte's notion of
\emph{invariants}, which has already proved useful for some quadrant models.
Three models are found to be algebraic, one is (only) D-finite, and the last
one is (only) D-algebraic. We also solve in the same fashion the diagonal model
$\{ \nearrow, \nwarrow, \swarrow, \searrow\}$, which is D-finite. The three
algebraic models are those of the Kreweras trilogy, $S=\{\nearrow, \leftarrow,
\downarrow\}$, $S'=\{\rightarrow, \uparrow, \swarrow\}$, and $S\cup S'$.
  Our solutions take similar forms for all six models. Roughly speaking, the
square of the generating function of three-quadrant walks with steps in $S$ is
an explicit rational function in the quadrant generating function with steps in
$\{(j-i,j): (i,j) \in S\}$. We derive various corollaries, including an
explicit algebraic description of the positive harmonic function in $C$ for the
five models that are at least D-finite.

computational tasks over classical computers. Designing quantum circuits for
practical use, however, is not a trivial objective and requires expert-level
knowledge. To aid this endeavor, this paper proposes a machine learning-based
method to construct quantum circuit architectures. Previous works have
demonstrated that classical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms can
successfully construct quantum circuit architectures without encoded physics
knowledge. However, these DRL-based works are not generalizable to settings
with changing device noises, thus requiring considerable amounts of training
resources to keep the RL models up-to-date. With this in mind, we incorporated
continual learning to enhance the performance of our algorithm. In this paper,
we present the Probabilistic Policy Reuse with deep Q-learning (PPR-DQL)
framework to tackle this circuit design challenge. By conducting numerical
simulations over various noise patterns, we demonstrate that the RL agent with
PPR was able to find the quantum gate sequence to generate the two-qubit Bell
state faster than the agent that was trained from scratch. The proposed
framework is general and can be applied to other quantum gate synthesis or
control problems -- including the automatic calibration of quantum devices.

questions involve explicit or implicit time constraints, question answering
(QA) over TKGs has been a relatively unexplored area. Existing solutions are
mainly designed for simple temporal questions that can be answered directly by
a single TKG fact. This paper puts forth a comprehensive embedding-based
framework for answering complex questions over TKGs. Our method termed temporal
question reasoning (TempoQR) exploits TKG embeddings to ground the question to
the specific entities and time scope it refers to. It does so by augmenting the
question embeddings with context, entity and time-aware information by
employing three specialized modules. The first computes a textual
representation of a given question, the second combines it with the entity
embeddings for entities involved in the question, and the third generates
question-specific time embeddings. Finally, a transformer-based encoder learns
to fuse the generated temporal information with the question representation,
which is used for answer predictions. Extensive experiments show that TempoQR
improves accuracy by 25--45 percentage points on complex temporal questions
over state-of-the-art approaches and it generalizes better to unseen question

  Spatial Arrangement in Overhead Images",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increasing availability and accessibility of numerous overhead images
allows us to estimate and assess the spatial arrangement of groups of
geospatial target objects, which can benefit many applications, such as traffic
monitoring and agricultural monitoring. Spatial arrangement estimation is the
process of identifying the areas which contain the desired objects in overhead
images. Traditional supervised object detection approaches can estimate
accurate spatial arrangement but require large amounts of bounding box
annotations. Recent semi-supervised clustering approaches can reduce manual
labeling but still require annotations for all object categories in the image.
This paper presents the target-guided generative model (TGGM), under the
Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) framework, which uses Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) to estimate the distributions of both hidden and decoder variables in
VAE. Modeling both hidden and decoder variables by GMM reduces the required
manual annotations significantly for spatial arrangement estimation. Unlike
existing approaches that the training process can only update the GMM as a
whole in the optimization iterations (e.g., a ""minibatch""), TGGM allows the
update of individual GMM components separately in the same optimization
iteration. Optimizing GMM components separately allows TGGM to exploit the
semantic relationships in spatial data and requires only a few labels to
initiate and guide the generative process. Our experiments shows that TGGM
achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and
outperforms unsupervised methods by 10% based on the $F_{1}$ scores, while
requiring significantly fewer labeled data.

these fixed points to construct a path of strict decay, in general, requires
specific dynamical properties of associated monotone operators. For particular
types of gain operators such as max-type operators and subadditive operators,
these properties follow from uniform global asymptotic stability of the system

for participants that bid at a sub-minute timescale. To that end, we model the
market-clearing process as a dynamical system, called market dynamics, which is
temporally coupled with the grid frequency dynamics and is thus required to
guarantee system-wide stability while meeting the system operational
constraints. We characterize participants as price-takers who rationally update
their bids to maximize their utility in response to real-time schedules of
prices and dispatch. For two common bidding mechanisms, based on quantity and
price, we identify a notion of alignment between participants' behavior and
planners' goals that leads to a saddle-based design of the market that
guarantees convergence to a point meeting all operational constraints. We
further explore cases where this alignment property does not hold and observe
that misaligned participants' bidding can destabilize the closed-loop system.
We thus design a regularized version of the market dynamics that recovers all
the desirable stability and steady-state performance guarantees. Numerical
tests validate our results on the IEEE 39-bus system.

performance, especially when operating near the psychophysical threshold. For
instance, if subjects know that one choice is much more likely than the other,
they can make that choice when evidence is weak. A common hypothesis for these
kinds of tasks is that the prior is stored in neural activity. Here we propose
a different hypothesis: the prior is stored in synaptic strengths. We study the
International Brain Laboratory task, in which a grating appears on either the
right or left side of a screen, and a mouse has to move a wheel to bring the
grating to the center. The grating is often low in contrast which makes the
task relatively difficult, and the prior probability that the grating appears
on the right is either 80% or 20%, in (unsignaled) blocks of about 50 trials.
We model this as a reinforcement learning task, using a feedforward neural
network to map states to actions, and adjust the weights of the network to
maximize reward, learning via policy gradient. Our model uses an internal state
that stores an estimate of the grating and confidence, and follows Bayesian
updates, and can switch between engaged and disengaged states to mimic animal
behavior. This model reproduces the main experimental finding - that the
psychometric curve with respect to contrast shifts after a block switch in
about 10 trials. Also, as seen in the experiments, in our model the difference
in neuronal activity in the right and left blocks is small - it is virtually
impossible to decode block structure from activity on single trials if noise is
about 2%. The hypothesis that priors are stored in weights is difficult to
test, but the technology to do so should be available in the not so distant
future.

performance of an image sensor. However, confusions sometimes arise between the
two types of SNRs. The first one is the output-referred SNR which measures the
ratio between the signal and the noise seen at the sensor's output. This SNR is
easy to compute, and it is linear in the log-log scale for most image sensors.
The second SNR is the exposure-referred SNR, also known as the input-referred
SNR. This SNR considers the noise at the input by including a derivative term
to the output-referred SNR. The two SNRs have similar behaviors for sensors
with a large full-well capacity. However, for sensors with a small full-well
capacity, the exposure-referred SNR can capture some behaviors that the
output-referred SNR cannot.
  While the exposure-referred SNR has been known and used by the industry for a
long time, a theoretically rigorous derivation from a signal processing
perspective is lacking. In particular, while various equations can be found in
different sources of the literature, there is currently no paper that attempts
to assemble, derive, and organize these equations in one place. This paper aims
to fill the gap by answering four questions: (1) How is the exposure-referred
SNR derived from first principles? (2) Is the output-referred SNR a special
case of the exposure-referred SNR, or are they completely different? (3) How to
compute the SNR efficiently? (4) What utilities can the SNR bring to solving
imaging tasks? New theoretical results are derived for image sensors of any

due to not considering the correlation between phenotypes. The typical
approaches are many global testing methods, such as multivariate analysis of
variance (MANOVA), which tests the overall association between phenotypes and
each gene, without considersing the heterogeneity among phenotypes. In this
paper, we extend and evaluate two p-value combination methods, adaptive
weighted Fisher's method (AFp) and adaptive Fisher's method (AFz), to tackle
this problem, where AFp stands out as our final proposed method, based on
extensive simulations and a real application. Our proposed AFp method has three
advantages over traditional global testing methods. Firstly, it can consider
the heterogeneity of phenotypes and determines which specific phenotypes a gene
is associated with, using phenotype specific 0-1 weights. Secondly, AFp takes
the p-values from the test of association of each phenotype as input, thus can
accommodate different types of phenotypes (continuous, binary and count).
Thirdly, we also apply bootstrapping to construct a variability index for the
weight estimator of AFp and generate a co-membership matrix to categorize
(cluster) genes based on their association-patterns for intuitive biological
investigations. Through extensive simulations, AFp shows superior performance
over global testing methods in terms of type I error control and statistical
power, as well as higher accuracy of 0-1 weights estimation over AFz. A real
omics application with transcriptomic and clinical data of complex lung
diseases demonstrates insightful biological findings of AFp.

observed HE 0515$-$4414 for 16.1$\,$h with the Very Large Telescope and present

parts-per-million (ppm) precision from the new ESPRESSO spectrograph:
$\Delta\alpha/\alpha = 1.3 \pm 1.3_{\rm stat} \pm 0.4_{\rm sys}\,{\rm ppm}$.
The statistical uncertainty (1$\sigma$) is similar to the ensemble precision of
previous large samples of absorbers, and derives from the high S/N achieved
($\approx$105 per 0.4$\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$ pixel). ESPRESSO's design, and
calibration of our observations with its laser frequency comb, effectively
removed wavelength calibration errors from our measurement. The high resolving
power of our ESPRESSO spectrum ($R=145000$) enabled the identification of very
narrow components within the absorption profile, allowing a more robust
analysis of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$. The evidence for the narrow components is
corroborated by their correspondence with previously detected molecular
hydrogen and neutral carbon. The main remaining systematic errors arise from
ambiguities in the absorption profile modelling, effects from redispersing the
individual quasar exposures, and convergence of the parameter estimation
algorithm. All analyses of the spectrum, including systematic error estimates,
were initially blinded to avoid human biases. We make our reduced ESPRESSO
spectrum of HE 0515$-$4414 publicly available for further analysis. Combining
our ESPRESSO result with 28 measurements, from other spectrographs, in which
wavelength calibration errors have been mitigated, yields a weighted mean

  High-PerformanceComputer Architecture (HPCA-28)",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are relatively robust to noise, but
errors are still a significant detriment to VQAs on near-term quantum machines.
It is imperative to employ error mitigation techniques to improve VQA fidelity.
While existing error mitigation techniques built from theory provide
substantial gains, the disconnect between theory and real machine execution
limits their benefits. Thus, it is critical to optimize mitigation techniques
to explicitly suit the target application as well as the noise characteristics
of the target machine.
  We propose VAQEM, which dynamically tailors existing error mitigation
techniques to the actual, dynamic noisy execution characteristics of VQAs on a
target quantum machine. We do so by tuning specific features of these
mitigation techniques similar to the traditional rotation angle parameters - by
targeting improvements towards a specific objective function which represents
the VQA problem at hand. In this paper, we target two types of error mitigation
techniques which are suited to idle times in quantum circuits: single qubit
gate scheduling and the insertion of dynamical decoupling sequences. We gain
substantial improvements to VQA objective measurements - a mean of over 3x
across a variety of VQA applications, run on IBM Quantum machines.
  More importantly, the proposed variational approach is general and can be

large-scale systems. One common scalable dispatching paradigm is the
``power-of-$d$,'' in which the dispatcher queries $d$ servers at random and
assigns the job to a server based only on the state of the queried servers. The
bulk of power-of-$d$ policies studied in the literature assume that the system
is homogeneous, meaning that all servers have the same speed; meanwhile
real-world systems often exhibit server speed heterogeneity.
  This paper introduces a general framework for describing and analyzing
heterogeneity-aware power-of-$d$ policies. The key idea behind our framework is
that dispatching policies can make use of server speed information at two
decision points: when choosing which $d$ servers to query, and when assigning a
job to one of those servers. Our framework explicitly separates the dispatching
policy into a querying rule and an assignment rule; we consider general
families of both rule types.
  While the strongest assignment rules incorporate both detailed queue-length
information and server speed information, these rules typically are difficult
to analyze. We overcome this difficulty by focusing on heterogeneity-aware
assignment rules that ignore queue length information beyond idleness status.
In this setting, we analyze mean response time and formulate novel optimization
problems for the joint optimization of querying and assignment. We build upon
our optimized policies to develop heuristic queue length-aware dispatching
policies. Our heuristic policies perform well in simulation, relative to
policies that have appeared in the literature.

issues that hamper the convergence to the complete basis set (CBS) limit,
especially in correlated calculations. In this work, we revisit Dunning's
strategy for construction of correlation-consistent basis sets and examine the
relationship between accuracy and numerical stability in periodic settings.
Specifically, we find that limiting the number of primitive functions avoids
the appearance of problematic small exponents while still providing smooth
convergence to the CBS limit. As an example, we generate double-, triple-, and
quadruple-zeta correlation-consistent Gaussian basis sets for periodic
calculations with Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials. Our basis sets
cover the main-group elements from the first three rows of the periodic table.
Especially for atoms on the left side of the periodic table, our basis sets are

represented by a set of quality-aware and aggregation networks. In addition to
architecture modifications, we propose two task-specific loss functions:
multimodal separability loss and multimodal compactness loss. The first loss
assures that the representations of modalities for a class have comparable
magnitudes to provide a better quality estimation, while the multimodal
representations of different classes are distributed to achieve maximum
discrimination in the embedding space. The second loss, which is considered to
regularize the network weights, improves the generalization performance by
regularizing the framework. We evaluate the performance by considering three

brush-forming chains have an affinity to the substrate. For sufficiently strong
surface interactions, a fraction of chains condenses into a near-surface layer,
while the remaining ones form the outer brush with a reduced grafting density.
The dense layer and the more tenuous outer brush can be seen as coexisting
microphases. The effective grafting density of the outer brush is controlled by
the adsorption strength and can be changed reversibly as a response to changes
in environmental parameters.
  In this paper we use numerical self-consistent field calculations and
theoretical considerations to study this phenomenon in polydisperse brushes.
Our results reveal an unexpected effect: Although all chains are chemically
identical, shorter chains are adsorbed preferentially. Hence, with the increase
in the surface affinity parameter, a reduction in the surface grafting density
of the residual brush is accompanied by a change in the shape of its molecular
mass distribution. In particular, an originally bidisperse brush can be
effectively transformed into a nearly monodisperse one containing only the

strapping field and the flux rope twist in a parametric simulation study of
flux rope ejection from approximately marginally stable force-free equilibria,
different ratios of self- and mutual helicity are set and the onset of the
torus or helical kink instability is obtained. The helicity shed is found to
vary over a broad range from a minor to a major part of the initial helicity,
with self helicity being largely or completely shed and mutual helicity, which
makes up the larger part of the initial helicity, being shed only partly.
Torus-unstable configurations with subcritical twist and without a guide field
shed up to about two-thirds of the initial helicity, while a highly twisted,
kink-unstable configuration sheds only about one-quarter. The parametric study
also yields stable force-free flux rope equilibria up to a total
flux-normalized helicity of 0.25, with a ratio of self- to total helicity of
0.32 and a ratio of flux rope to external poloidal flux of 0.94. These results
numerically demonstrate the conjecture of helicity shedding by coronal mass
ejections and provide a first account of its parametric dependence. Both self-

directly (without decompressing it) can save space and time by orders of
magnitude. In this work, we focus on fundamental sequence comparison problems
and try to quantify the gain in time complexity when the underlying data is
highly compressible. We consider grammar compression, which unifies many
practically relevant compression schemes. For two strings of total length $N$
and total compressed size $n$, it is known that the edit distance and a longest
common subsequence (LCS) can be computed exactly in time $\tilde{O}(nN)$, as
opposed to $O(N^2)$ for the uncompressed setting. Many applications need to
align multiple sequences simultaneously, and the fastest known exact algorithms
for median edit distance and LCS of $k$ strings run in $O(N^k)$ time. This
naturally raises the question of whether compression can help to reduce the
running time significantly for $k \geq 3$, perhaps to $O(N^{k/2}n^{k/2})$ or
$O(Nn^{k-1})$. Unfortunately, we show lower bounds that rule out any
improvement beyond $\Omega(N^{k-1}n)$ time for any of these problems assuming
the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis.
  At the same time, we show that approximation and compression together can be
surprisingly effective. We develop an $\tilde{O}(N^{k/2}n^{k/2})$-time FPTAS
for the median edit distance of $k$ sequences. In comparison, no
$O(N^{k-\Omega(1)})$-time PTAS is known for the median edit distance problem in
the uncompressed setting. For two strings, we get an
$\tilde{O}(N^{2/3}n^{4/3})$-time FPTAS for both edit distance and LCS. In
contrast, for uncompressed strings, there is not even a subquadratic algorithm
for LCS that has less than a polynomial gap in the approximation factor.
Building on the insight from our approximation algorithms, we also obtain
results for many distance measures including the edit, Hamming, and shift
distances.

hot-spot pressure can be significantly reduced by heat-flow anisotropy.
Simulations including a P2 drive asymmetry then show that the magnetized yield
is a maximum when the capsule drive corrects the hot-spot shape to be round at
neutron bang-time. The benefit of an applied field increases when the implosion
is more highly perturbed. Increasing the magnetic field strength past the value
required to magnetize the electrons is beneficial due to additional suppression
of perturbations by magnetic tension.

DFT coefficients to be known. When the DFT coefficients of a rasterized image
(represented as a matrix) are known only within a pass band, the original
matrix cannot be uniquely recovered. In many cases of practical importance, the
matrix is binary and its elements can be reduced to one of the two values,
either 0 or 1. This is the case, for example, for the commonly used QR codes.
The a priori information that the matrix is binary can compensate for the
missing high-frequency DFT coefficients and restore uniqueness of image
recovery. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the smallest band limit
for which unique recovery of a generic binary matrix is still possible. The
results depend on the dimensions of the matrix. Uniqueness results are proven
for the dimensions $p \times q$, $p \times p$, and $p^\alpha\times p^\alpha$,
where $p \neq q$ are prime numbers and $\alpha>1$ an integer. Inversion
algorithms are proposed for uniquely recovering the matrix from its
band-limited (blurred) version. The algorithms combine integer linear
programming methods with lattice basis reduction techniques and significantly
outperform naive implementations. The algorithm efficiently and reliably
reconstructs severely blurred $29 \times 29$ binary matrices with only 121 out

ideas and influence each other's opinions. A popular approach to study the
spread of opinions on networks is by examining bounded-confidence models
(BCMs), in which the nodes of a network have continuous-valued states that
encode their opinions and are receptive to other nodes' opinions when they lie
within some confidence bound of their own opinion. In this paper, we extend the
Deffuant--Weisbuch (DW) model, which is a well-known BCM, by examining the
spread of opinions that coevolve with network structure. We propose an adaptive
variant of the DW model in which the nodes of a network can (1) alter their
opinions when they interact with neighboring nodes and (2) break connections
with neighbors based on an opinion tolerance threshold and then form new
connections following the principle of homophily. This opinion tolerance
threshold determines whether or not the opinions of adjacent nodes are
sufficiently different to be viewed as `discordant'. Using numerical
simulations, we find that our adaptive DW model requires a larger confidence
bound than a baseline DW model for the nodes of a network to achieve a
consensus opinion. In one region of parameter space, we observe
`pseudo-consensus' steady states, in which there exist multiple subclusters of
an opinion cluster with opinions that differ from each other by a small amount.
In our simulations, we also examine the importance of early-time dynamics and
nodes with initially moderate opinions for achieving consensus. Additionally,
we explore the effects of coevolution on the convergence time of our BCM.

intrinsic geometrical parametrisation of LDs, free of the time variable, for 1

the energy of the system and on the geometry of the associated level curve. We
discuss applications of this framework on classical problems on the plane and

developed apparatus allows to characterise semi-analytically the rate at which
the derivatives of the geometrical LDs become singular when approaching the

found irrespective from the dynamical system. Some of our results are connected

fields perpendicular to the $c$-axis in a single crystal that has been
carefully cut by a plasma focused ion beam to an ellipsoidal shape to minimize
the inhomogeneity of the internal demagnetization field. The resulting dramatic
increase in spectral resolution enabled us to resolve the anisotropy of the
electric field gradient and to measure the magnetic and quadrupolar relaxation
channels separately. Perpendicular magnetic fields nominally do not couple to
the low energy degrees of freedom, but we find a significant nonlinear
contribution for sufficiently large fields that give rise to a rich phase
diagram. The in-plane magnetic field can act either as an effective transverse
or longitudinal field to the Ising nematic order, depending on the orientation
relative to the principle axes of the quadrupole order, and leads to a marked
in-plane anisotropy in both relaxation channels. We find that the small
in-plane transverse fields initially enhance the ferroquadrupolar ordering
temperature but eventually suppress the long-range order. We tentatively
ascribe this behavior to the competing effects of field-induced mixing of
higher energy crystal field states and the destabilizing effects of

Permutation Invariant training (PIT), the order of separated speech chunks is
nondeterministic and leads to difficulty in accurately stitching homogenous
speaker chunks for downstream tasks like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
Also, most of these models are trained with synthetic mixtures and do not
generalize to real conversational data. In this paper, we propose a speaker
conditioned separator trained on speaker embeddings extracted directly from the
mixed signal using an over-clustering based approach. This model naturally
regulates the order of the separated chunks without the need for an additional

is one of the most fundamental context-free languages. The Dyck edit distance
quantifies the number of edits (character insertions, deletions, and

Folding involves a similar problem, where a closing parenthesis can match an
opening parenthesis of the same type irrespective of their ordering. For
example, in RNA Folding, both $\tt{()}$ and $\tt{)(}$ are valid matches,
whereas the Dyck language only allows $\tt{()}$ as a match. Using fast matrix
multiplication, it is possible to compute their exact solutions of both
problems in time $O(n^{2.824})$. Whereas combinatorial algorithms would be more
desirable, the two problems are known to be at least as hard as Boolean matrix
multiplication. In terms of fast approximation algorithms that are
combinatorial in nature, both problems admit an $\epsilon n$-additive
approximation in $\tilde{O}(\frac{n^2}{\epsilon})$ time. Further, there is a
$O(\log n)$-factor approximation algorithm for Dyck edit distance in
near-linear time.
  In this paper, we design a constant-factor approximation algorithm for Dyck

$(1+\epsilon)$-factor approximation algorithm running in

additive approximation. Finally, we design a $(3+\epsilon)$-approximation that
takes $\tilde{O}(\frac{nd}{\epsilon})$ time, where $d\ge 1$ is an upper bound
on the sought distance. As for RNA folding, for any $s\ge1$, we design a
factor-$s$ approximation algorithm that runs in $O(n+(\frac{n}{s})^3)$ time. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first nontrivial approximation algorithm
for RNA Folding that can go below the $n^2$ barrier. All our algorithms are

been shown that the iterative sequence generated by AFBA with a modified

in terms of the distance between consecutive iterates (DCI-convergence rate).
In this paper, we propose a more general momentum scheme with an introduced
power parameter $\omega\in(0,1]$ and show that AFBA with the proposed momentum
scheme converges to a minimizer of the objective function with an
$o\left(\frac{1}{k^{2\omega}}\right)$ FV-convergence rate and an

Different with previous quantum key agreement (QKA) protocols, the proposed
single-state three-party SQKA protocol can realize the goal that a quantum
party and two classical parties who only possess limited quantum capabilities
equally contribute to the generation of a shared private key over quantum
channels. Detailed security analysis turns out that the proposed single-state
three-party SQKA protocol is secure against several famous attacks from an
outside eavesdropper, such as the Trojan horse attack, the entangle-measure
attack, the measure-resend attack and the intercept-resend attack. Moreover, it
can resist the participant attack, which means that the shared private key
cannot be determined fully by any nontrivial subset of three parties. The
proposed single-state three-party SQKA protocol has the following nice
features: (1) it only employs one kind of three-particle GHZ entangled states
as initial quantum resource; (2) it doesn't need pre-shared keys among
different parties; (3) it doesn't need unitary operations or quantum
entanglement swapping. Finally, we generalize the proposed single-state
three-party SQKA protocol into the case of N-party by only employing one kind
of N-particle GHZ entangled states as initial quantum resource, which inherits
the nice features of its three-party counterpart.

substrate, a series of commensuration effects can arise when the number of
particles is an integer multiple of the number of substrate minima. Such
commensuration effects can appear for vortices in type-II superconductors with
periodic pinning or for colloidal particles on optical landscapes. Under bulk
external driving, the pinning or drag on the particles is strongly enhanced at
commensuration. Here we consider the active rheology of a single particle
driven through an assembly of particles coupled to a periodic substrate at
different commensurate conditions. For increasing density at fixed driving
force, we observe nonmonotonic drag along with what we call an
anti-commensuration effect where the drag or pinning effectiveness is reduced
in commensurate states, opposite from the behavior typically observed under
bulk driving. The velocity enhancement or drag reduction appears when the
background particles form a crystalline state that is coupled more strongly to
the substrate than to the driven particle, while under incommensurate
conditions, the background particles are disordered and produce enhanced drag
on the probe particle. The velocity noise of the driven particle has a narrow
band signature at commensuration and a broad band signature away from
commensuration. We map out the regions in which viscous flow, periodic flow,
and a pinned phase appear. We show that the effects we observe are robust on
both square and triangular substrate arrays and for both vortices in type-II

always increase? This is the kind of question we address in this article.
Surprisingly, we show that it is possible that the variation of the reality of
$X'$ is bigger than the variation of the reality of $X$. As well, the
monitoring map of $X$ does not affect the already established reality of $X'$,
even when they are maximally incompatible. On the other hand, there are
circumstances where the variation of reality of both observables is the same,
even when they are maximally incompatible. Besides, we give a quantum circuit
to implement the monitoring map and use it to experimentally verify the
variation of reality of observables using IBM's quantum computers.

significant success by exploring essential properties of videos, e.g. speed,

continuity-related pretext tasks, i.e. continuity justification, discontinuity
localization, and missing section approximation, that jointly supervise a
shared backbone for video representation learning. This self-supervision
approach, termed as Continuity Perception Network (CPNet), solves the three

long-ranged motion and context representations. It outperforms prior arts on
multiple downstream tasks, such as action recognition, video retrieval, and
action localization. Additionally, the video continuity can be complementary to
other coarse-grained video properties for representation learning, and
integrating the proposed pretext task to prior arts can yield much performance
gains.

An unraveling algorithm is developed to uncouple particle motion from the

the motion of membrane proteins confined in the tubules of the peripheral

diffusive motion with a well-characterized diffusivity. Our algorithm provides
a generally applicable approach for disentangling geometric morphology and

coupled to two Minkowski spacetimes as the thermal baths. We consider two
different situations for the matter fields: First, the matter fields are
described by a $CFT_{d+2}$ whose central charge $c$ is very large. Second, they
are described by a d+2 dimensional HV QFT which has a holographic gravitational
theory that is a HV geometry at zero temperature. For both cases, we calculate
the Page curve of the Hawking radiation as well as the Page time $t_{\rm

Page time and saturates after this time. Moreover, $t_{\rm Page}$ is
proportional to $\frac{2 S_{\rm th}}{c T}$, where $S_{\rm th}$ and $T$ are the
thermal entropy and temperature of the black brane. For the second case, when
the hyperscaling violation exponent $\theta_m$ of the matter fields is zero,
the results are very similar to those for the first case. However, when
$\theta_m \neq 0$, the entropy of Hawking radiation grows exponentially before
$t_{\rm Page}$ and saturates after this time. Furthermore, the Page time is
proportional to $\log \left( \frac{1}{G_{\rm N,r}} \right) $, where $G_{\rm
N,r}$ is the renormalized Newton's constant. It was also observed that for both
cases, $t_{\rm Page}$ is a decreasing and an increasing function of the
dynamical exponent $z$ and hyperscaling violation exponent $\theta$ of the
black brane geometry, respectively. Moreover, for the second case, $t_{\rm
Page}$ is independent of $z_m$, and for $\theta_m \neq 0$, it is a decreasing
function of $\theta_m$.

perform the device association, computation offloading and resource allocation

utilize the computation resources, we take account of multi-step computation
offloading. Considering that the finally formulated problem is in a nonlinear

greatly reduce the network-wide energy consumption under devices' latency

between the inter-component interaction strength and the component-wise
interaction strength. If the inter-component interaction is stronger than the
component-wise interaction, we can expect all the components to be synchronized
in the course of metastable transition. However, if the inter-component
interaction is relatively weaker, then the components will be desynchronized in
the course of metastable transition. For the two-component Curie-Weiss model,
the phase transition from synchronization to desynchronization has been
precisely characterized in studies owing to its mean-field nature. The purpose
of this paper is to extend this result to the Curie-Weiss-Potts model with
three spins. We observe that the nature of the phase transition for the
three-spin case is entirely different from the two-spin case of the Curie-Weiss

  Purpose: To develop a method that automatically segments and quantifies lung

COVID-19 patients.
  Materials and Methods: In this study, we incorporated data augmentation to
generate synthetic chest CT images using public available datasets (285
datasets from ""Lung Nodule Analysis 2016""). The synthetic images and masks were
used to train a 2D U-net neural network and tested on 203 COVID-19 datasets to
generate lung and lesion segmentations. Disease severity scores (DL: damage
load; DS: damage score) were calculated based on the segmentations.
Correlations between DL/DS and clinical lab tests were evaluated using
Pearson's method. A p-value < 0.05 was considered as statistical significant.
  Results: Automatic lung and lesion segmentations were compared with manual
annotations. For lung segmentation, the median values of dice similarity
coefficient, Jaccard index and average surface distance, were 98.56%, 97.15%
and 0.49 mm, respectively. The same metrics for lesion segmentation were

were found between DL/DS and percentage lymphocytes tests, with r-values of
-0.561 and -0.501, respectively.
  Conclusion: An AI system that based on thoracic radiographic and data
augmentation was proposed to segment lung and lesions in COVID-19 patients.
Correlations between imaging findings and clinical lab tests suggested the
value of this system as a potential tool to assess disease severity of

azimuthal order $m$ $=4,2$) Love number $k_{42}=1.289\pm0.063$ ($1\sigma$), an
order of magnitude above the hydrostatic $k_{42}$ obtained in a nonrotating
Jupiter model. After numerically modeling rotation, the hydrostatic
$k_{42}=1.743\pm0.002$ is still $7\sigma$ away from the observation, raising
doubts about our understanding of Jupiter's tidal response. Here, we use
first-order perturbation theory to explain the hydrostatic $k_{42}$ result
analytically. We use a simple Jupiter equation of state ($n=1$ polytrope) to
obtain the fractional change in $k_{42}$ when comparing a rotating model with a
nonrotating model. Our analytical result shows that the hydrostatic $k_{42}$ is
dominated by the tidal response at $\ell=m=2$ coupled into the spherical
harmonic $\ell,m=4,2$ by the planet's oblate figure. The $\ell=4$ normalization
in $k_{42}$ introduces an orbital factor $(a/s)^2$ into $k_{42}$, where $a$ is
the satellite semimajor axis and $s$ is Jupiter's average radius. As a result,
different Galilean satellites produce a different $k_{42}$. We conclude that
high-degree tesseral Love numbers ($\ell> m$, $m\geq2$) are dominated by
lower-degree Love numbers and thus provide little additional information about
interior structure, at least when they are primarily hydrostatic. Our results
entail important implications for a future interpretation of the currently
observed Juno $k_{42}$. After including the coupling from the well-understood
$\ell=2$ dynamical tides ($\Delta k_2 \approx -4\%$), Jupiter's hydrostatic
$k_{42}$ requires an unknown dynamical effect to produce a fractional
correction $\Delta k_{42}\approx-11\%$ in order to fit Juno's observation
within $3\sigma$. Future work is required to explain the required $\Delta
k_{42}$.

out a comprehensive numerical exploration of the long-term evolution of Pallene

dynamical state around Pallene. A simple tidal evolution model serves to set a
time frame for the current orbital configuration of the system. With detailed
short and long-term N-body simulations we determine whether Pallene is
currently in resonance with one or more of six of Saturn's major moons. We
analysed a myriad of resonant arguments extracted from the direct and indirect
parts of the disturbing function, finding that Pallene is not in mean motion
resonance from the present up to 5~Myr into the future; nonetheless, some
resonant arguments exhibit intervals of libration and circulation at different
timescales and moon pairings. We studied the dynamical evolution of micrometric
particles forming the ring, considering gravitational and non-gravitational
forces. Non-gravitational forces are responsible for particles vertical
excursions and outward migration. By estimating the satellite's mass production
rate, we find that Pallene could be responsible for keeping its ring in
steady-state only if it is mainly composed of large micrometre-sized particles.
If mainly composed of particles with a few micrometres for which Pallene is the
only source, the ring will spread out, both radially and vertically, until it
finally disappears.

delivery system capable of enhanced transport beyond that of passive Brownian

immersed in a viscous fluid is proposed. By maintaining a steady-state solute
gradient inside the vesicle, a seepage flow of the solvent (e.g., water) across
the semipermeable membrane is generated which in turn propels the vesicle. We
develop a theoretical model for this vesicle-solute system in which the seepage
flow is described by a Darcy flow. Using the reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow
it is shown that the seepage velocity at the exterior surface of the vesicle
generates a thrust force which is balanced by the hydrodynamic drag such that
there is no net force on the vesicle. We characterize the motility of the
vesicle in relation to the concentration distribution of the solute confined
inside the vesicle. Any osmotic solute is able to propel the vesicle so long as
a concentration gradient is present. In the present work, we propose active
Brownian particles (ABPs) as a solute. To maintain a symmetry-breaking
concentration gradient, we consider ABPs with spatially varying swim speed and
ABPs with constant properties but under the influence of an orienting field. In
particular, it is shown that at high activity the vesicle velocity is

constructing a policy that makes the closed-loop system trajectories inherently

contraction metric, which is the distance metric with respect to which a
robot's trajectories exhibit contraction is often non-trivial. We propose to
jointly learn the control policy and its corresponding contraction metric while

the robotic system from an offline data set consisting of the robot's state and
input trajectories. Using this learned dynamics model, we propose a data
augmentation algorithm for learning contraction policies. We randomly generate
samples in the state-space and propagate them forward in time through the
learned dynamics model to generate auxiliary sample trajectories. We then learn
both the control policy and the contraction metric such that the distance
between the trajectories from the offline data set and our generated auxiliary
sample trajectories decreases over time. We evaluate the performance of our
proposed framework on simulated robotic goal-reaching tasks and demonstrate
that enforcing contraction results in faster convergence and greater robustness

$\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) on the Coulomb branch of

simplicity arise due to the fact that it has the smallest possible value of the
$c$ central charge among unitary interacting $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs. A main
purpose of this note is to uncover additional aspects of this minimal
Argyres-Douglas (MAD) theory's simplicity. In particular, we argue that: (1)
the MAD theory shares an infinite set of large spin thresholds in part of its
operator spectrum with the free $\mathcal{N}=2$ Maxwell theory (this data is
therefore invariant under generic $\mathcal{N}=2$-preserving renormalization
group flows to the IR) and (2) the MAD theory has, at every order in the
natural grading, the smallest number of ""Schur"" operators of any unitary
$\mathcal{N}=2$ theory (interacting or free). We then show that property (1)
has a suitable generalization for all $(A_1, A_{2k})$ cousins of the MAD
theory. In particular, the corresponding large spin thresholds encode generic
renormalization group flows within this class. This construction therefore
gives a different handle on these flows from the one provided by the
Seiberg-Witten description. To emphasize the importance of these spin
thresholds, we abstractly study theories with ""enough matter"" to form Higgs

still been illusive. In this work, we first identify the fundamental
bottlenecks of SL, and thereby propose a scalable SL framework, coined SGLR.
The server under SGLR broadcasts a common gradient averaged at the split-layer,
emulating FL without any additional communication across clients as opposed to
SplitFed. Meanwhile, SGLR splits the learning rate into its server-side and
client-side rates, and separately adjusts them to support many clients in
parallel. Simulation results corroborate that SGLR achieves higher accuracy
than other baseline SL methods including SplitFed, which is even on par with FL
consuming higher energy and communication costs. As a secondary result, we
observe greater reduction in leakage of sensitive information via mutual
information using SLGR over the baselines.

curved which can result in multiple images separated by a time delay, a
phenomenon known as strong lensing. Although gravitational wave lensing has not
been observed yet, it is currently predicted that it will be possible to detect
with third-generation detectors. Moreover, the future detectors are expected to
significantly increase the gravitational-wave detection rate up to $O(10^5 -
10^6)$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ which could also increase the chance of observing
gravitational wave lensing. Therefore, it is necessary to develop accurate and
efficient tools to filter potentially lensed gravitational-wave signal pairs.
In the study, we propose three statistics to analyze the overlap of two sky
localization probability maps, which could provide a quick preliminary lensing
analysis of two gravitational-wave signals within 3 seconds. We simulate 200
lensed pairs of gravitational-wave signals for 5 signal-to-noise ratios to
investigate the performance of the search methodology. By setting up a
threshold with a specific false positive rate $\mathrm{FPR} = 10^{-2}$ for the
three overlap statistics, we conclude that it is possible to filter out more
than $99\%$ of the non-lensed event pairs while keeping all lensed event pairs.

resource for the realization of high-dimensional qudits with spatial modes of

qudit state in the SPDC process. This problem can be addressed through advanced
computational learning methods; however, due to difficulties in modeling the
SPDC process by a fully differentiable algorithm that takes into account all
interaction effects, progress has been limited. Here, we overcome these
limitations and introduce a physically-constrained and differentiable model,
validated against experimental results for shaped pump beams and structured
crystals, capable of learning every interaction parameter in the process. We
avoid any restrictions induced by the stochastic nature of our physical model
and integrate the dynamic equations governing the evolution under the SPDC
Hamiltonian. We solve the inverse problem of designing a nonlinear quantum
optical system that achieves the desired quantum state of down-converted photon
pairs. The desired states are defined using either the second-order
correlations between different spatial modes or by specifying the required
density matrix. By learning nonlinear volume holograms as well as different
pump shapes, we successfully show how to generate maximally entangled states.
Furthermore, we simulate all-optical coherent control over the generated
quantum state by actively changing the profile of the pump beam. Our work can
be useful for applications such as novel designs of high-dimensional quantum
key distribution and quantum information processing protocols. In addition, our
method can be readily applied for controlling other degrees of freedom of light
in the SPDC process, such as the spectral and temporal properties, and may even
be used in condensed-matter systems having a similar interaction Hamiltonian.

but are challenging to be automated in industrial tasks such as bin picking.
They are long, flexible and tend to get entangled when randomly placed in a
bin. This makes it difficult for the robot to grasp a single one in dense
clutter. Besides, training or collecting data in simulation is challenging due
to the difficulties in modeling the combination of deformable and rigid
components for wire harnesses. In this work, instead of directly lifting wire
harnesses, we propose to grasp and extract the target following a circle-like
trajectory until it is untangled. We learn a policy from real-world data that
can infer grasps and separation actions from visual observation. Our policy
enables the robot to efficiently pick and separate entangled wire harnesses by
maximizing success rates and reducing execution time. To evaluate our policy,
we present a set of real-world experiments on picking wire harnesses. Our
policy achieves an overall 84.6% success rate compared with 49.2% in baseline.
We also evaluate the effectiveness of our policy under different clutter
scenarios using unseen types of wire harnesses. Results suggest that our
approach is feasible for handling wire harnesses in industrial bin picking.

designed and analyzed for the coupled Brinkman-Darcy flow and transport. The
flow equations are discretized by using a strongly mass conservative scheme in
mixed formulation with a suitable incorporation of the interface conditions. In
particular, the interface conditions can be incorporated into the discrete
formulation naturally without introducing additional variables. Moreover, the
proposed scheme behaves uniformly robust for various values of viscosity. A
novel upwinding staggered DG scheme in mixed form is exploited to solve the
transport equation, where the boundary correction terms are added to improve
the stability. A rigorous convergence analysis is carried out for the
approximation of the flow equations. The velocity error is shown to be
independent of the pressure and thus confirms the pressure-robustness.
Stability and a priori error estimates are also obtained for the approximation
of the transport equation; moreover, we are able to achieve a sharp stability
and convergence error estimates thanks to the strong mass conservation
preserved by our scheme. In particular, the stability estimate depends only on
the true velocity on the inflow boundary rather than on the approximated
velocity. Several numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical
findings and demonstrate the performances of the method.

numerical solvers with high fidelity. Based on the stochastic Galerkin
formulation, this paper addresses the idea and implementation of the first flux
reconstruction scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws with random inputs.
Unlike the finite volume method, the treatments in physical and random space
are consistent, e.g., the modal representation of solutions based on an
orthogonal polynomial basis and the nodal representation based on solution
collocation points. Therefore, the numerical behaviors of the scheme in the
phase space can be designed and understood uniformly. A family of filters is
extended to multi-dimensional cases to mitigate the well-known Gibbs phenomenon
arising from discontinuities in both physical and random space. The filter
function is switched on and off by the dynamic detection of discontinuous
solutions, and a slope limiter is employed to preserve the positivity of
physically realizable solutions. As a result, the proposed method is able to
capture stochastic cross-scale flow evolution where resolved and unresolved
regions coexist. Numerical experiments including wave propagation, Burgers'
shock, one-dimensional Riemann problem, and two-dimensional shock-vortex
interaction problem are presented to validate the scheme. The order of
convergence of the current scheme is identified. The capability of the scheme
for simulating smooth and discontinuous stochastic flow dynamics is
demonstrated. The open-source codes to reproduce the numerical results are

TMD model predicts high concentrations of positively charged defects

categories only occupying a few training samples. Decoupled training achieves
better performance by training backbone and classifier separately. What causes
the poorer performance of end-to-end model training (e.g., logits margin-based
methods)? In this work, we identify a key factor that affects the learning of
the classifier: the channel-correlated features with low entropy before
inputting into the classifier. From the perspective of information theory, we
analyze why cross-entropy loss tends to produce highly correlated features on
the imbalanced data. In addition, we theoretically analyze and prove its
impacts on the gradients of classifier weights, the condition number of

Channel Whitening to decorrelate (""scatter"") the classifier's inputs for
decoupling the weight update and reshaping the skewed decision boundary, which
achieves satisfactory results combined with logits margin-based method.
However, when the number of minor classes are large, batch imbalance and more
participation in training cause over-fitting of the major classes. We also
propose two novel modules, Block-based Relatively Balanced Batch Sampler (B3RS)
and Batch Embedded Training (BET) to solve the above problems, which makes the
end-to-end training achieve even better performance than decoupled training.

photocatalysis, severely limiting the photocatalytic efficiency. Here, we
develop a dipole-scheme (D-scheme for short) photocatalytic model and materials
realization. The D-scheme heterojunction not only can effectively separate
electrons and holes by a large polarization field, but also boosts
photocatalytic redox reactions with large driving photovoltages and without any
carrier loss. By means of first-principles and GW calculations, we propose a
D-scheme heterojunction prototype with two real polar materials, PtSeTe/LiGaS2.
This D-scheme photocatalyst exhibits a high capability of the photogenerated
carrier separation and near-infrared light absorption. Moreover, our
calculations of the Gibbs free energy imply a high ability of the hydrogen and
oxygen evolution reaction by a large driving force. The proposed D-scheme
photocatalytic model is generalized and paves a valuable route of significantly
improving the photocatalytic efficiency.

essential for ultrafast magnetization dynamics. Magnetoelectric multiferroics
of type II possess intrinsic correlations among magnetic sublattices and
electric polarization (P) through spin-lattice coupling, enabling fundamentally
coupled dynamics between spins and lattice. Here we report on ultrafast
magnetization dynamics in a room-temperature multiferroic hexaferrite
possessing ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic sublattices, revealed by
time-resolved resonant x-ray diffraction. A femtosecond above-bandgap
excitation triggers a coherent magnon in which the two magnetic sublattices
entangle and give rise to a transient modulation of P. A novel microscopic
mechanism for triggering the coherent magnon in this ferrimagnetic insulator
based on the spin-lattice coupling is proposed. Our finding opens up a novel

developing verified systems code. Because of its sometimes-onerous
restrictions, such as the lack of support for recursion and its strict
uniqueness type system, Cogent provides an escape hatch in the form of a
foreign function interface (FFI) to C code. This poses a problem when verifying
Cogent programs, as imported C components do not enjoy the same level of static
guarantees that Cogent does. Previous verification of file systems implemented
in Cogent merely assumed that their C components were correct and that they
preserved the invariants of Cogent's type system. In this paper, we instead
prove such obligations. We demonstrate how they smoothly compose with existing
Cogent theorems, and result in a correctness theorem of the overall Cogent-C
system. The Cogent FFI constraints ensure that key invariants of Cogent's type
system are maintained even when calling C code. We verify reusable higher-order

iterators and demonstrate their application to several examples including
binary search and the BilbyFs file system. We demonstrate the feasibility of

relies on consistency constraints which define a neighborhood around each
subsystem's reference trajectory where the state of the subsystem is guaranteed
to stay in. Reference trajectories and consistency constraints are known to
neighboring subsystems. Contrary to other relevant approaches, the reference
trajectories are improved consecutively. The presented approach allows the
formulation of convex optimization problems for systems with linear dynamics
even in the presence of non-convex state constraints. Additionally, we employ
tubes in order to ensure the controller's robustness against bounded
uncertainties. In the end, we briefly comment on an iterative extension of the
DMPC scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed DMPC scheme and its iterative

enhancing the scattering cross section of the object. The design philosophy of
the acoustic superscatterers is based on partially-resonant systems in which a
coating material or double-negative metamaterial complementary to the host
medium is provided on top of the rigid object. When the source lies within the
enhanced boundary of the complementary media, the interaction between the
radiated wavefront and the enhanced virtual boundary gets stronger and results
in suppression of the total forward radiated sound at far-field. An analytical
framework is shown in this paper on suppression of the total acoustic pressure
at far field in the forward direction when a cylindrical source, both monopole
and dipole, lies within the virtual rigid boundary of the superscatterer. Total
extinction cross section of the scatterer as a function of the distance between
the source and scatterer is derived to substantiate the earlier results.
Additionally, the effect of the area of cross-section of the cylindrical source
on the total forward radiated sound pressure at far-field is discussed.
Finally, the effectiveness of the analytical results is verified numerically

determined via network connections successively. This constructs a directed

Neurons in upper layers spike earlier than those in lower layers. More
interestingly, we find that among the same layer, neuron spiking order is
mainly associated with stimuli they receive from upper layer via network

more lethal in rapid exponential growth than in stationary phase. It is this
effect which makes radiotherapy effective in cancer treatment. This stress
effect can be explained in two ways: (a) more vulnerability in the growth
phase, (b) improved protection capacity and repair mechanisms in the stationary
phase. Although the two explanations do not exclude each other, they are very
different in the sense that (a) is a general mechanism whereas (b) is strain
and stress-factor dependent. In this paper we explore major facets of (a).
Firstly, we emphasize that (a) can account for known experimental stress-factor
evidence. Secondly, we observe that (a) rightly predicts that slow exponential
growth (meaning with a doubling time of several hours) results in a lower death
rate than fast exponential growth (doubling time of a fraction of one hour), an
effect that cannot be explained in the (b) framework because both organisms are
in the same phase. Thirdly, we conjecture that the stress-factor effect can be
extended to situations of chronic stress due to non-optimal environmental
conditions. If correct, this conjecture would imply that even in normal culture
conditions the natural death rate is lower in the stationary phase than in the
growth phase. Finally, the paper closes with the description of several open
questions and of appropriate test-experiments meant to address them.

generated automata admit all system behaviours over the given variables and
provide useful insight in the form of invariants that hold on the
implementation. To achieve this, the proposed approach uses a pluggable model
learning component that can generate an FSA from a given set of traces.
Conditions that encode a completeness hypothesis are then extracted from the
FSA under construction and used to evaluate its degree of completeness by
checking their truth value against the system using software model checking.
This generates new traces that express any missing behaviours. The new trace
data is used to iteratively refine the abstraction, until all system behaviours
are admitted by the learned abstraction. To evaluate the approach, we
reverse-engineer a set of publicly available Simulink Stateflow models from
their C implementations.

disks of gas and dust, thus inflicting changes on their morphological and
chemical composition. In this work, we aim at studying the effects that such
bursts may have on the spatial distribution of dust grain sizes and the
corresponding spectral index in protoplanetary disks. We use the numerical
hydrodynamics code FEOSAD, which simulates the co-evolution of gas, dust, and
volatiles in a protoplanetary disk, taking dust growth and back reaction on gas
into account. The dependence of the maximum dust size on the water ice mantles
is explicitly considered. The burst is initialized by increasing the luminosity
of the central star to 100-300 L_sun for a time period of 100 yr. The water
snowline shifts during the burst to a larger distance, resulting in the drop of
the maximum dust size interior to the snowline position because of more
efficient fragmentation of bare grains. After the burst, the water snowline
shifts quickly back to its preburst location followed by renewed dust growth.
The timescale of dust regrowth after the burst depends on the radial distance
so that the dust grains at smaller distances reach the preburst values faster
than the dust grains at larger distances. As a result, a broad peak in the
radial distribution of the spectral index in the millimeter dust emission
develops at \approx 10 au, which shifts further out as the disk evolves and
dust grains regrow to preburst values at progressively larger distances. This
feature is most pronounced in evolved axisymmetric disks rather than in young
gravitationally unstable counterparts, although young disks may still be good
candidates if gravitational instability is suppressed. Abridged.

the number N of data items is large, SGD relies on constructing an unbiased
estimator of the gradient of the empirical risk using a small subset of the
original dataset, called a minibatch. Default minibatch construction involves
uniformly sampling a subset of the desired size, but alternatives have been
explored for variance reduction. In particular, experimental evidence suggests
drawing minibatches from determinantal point processes (DPPs), distributions
over minibatches that favour diversity among selected items. However, like in
recent work on DPPs for coresets, providing a systematic and principled
understanding of how and why DPPs help has been difficult. In this work, we
contribute an orthogonal polynomial-based DPP paradigm for minibatch sampling
in SGD. Our approach leverages the specific data distribution at hand, which
endows it with greater sensitivity and power over existing data-agnostic
methods. We substantiate our method via a detailed theoretical analysis of its
convergence properties, interweaving between the discrete data set and the
underlying continuous domain. In particular, we show how specific DPPs and a
string of controlled approximations can lead to gradient estimators with a
variance that decays faster with the batchsize than under uniform sampling.
Coupled with existing finite-time guarantees for SGD on convex objectives, this
entails that, DPP minibatches lead to a smaller bound on the mean square
approximation error than uniform minibatches. Moreover, our estimators are
amenable to a recent algorithm that directly samples linear statistics of DPPs
(i.e., the gradient estimator) without sampling the underlying DPP (i.e., the
minibatch), thereby reducing computational overhead. We provide detailed
synthetic as well as real data experiments to substantiate our theoretical
claims.

interpret the edge weights and induce a metric on the vertices of the graph. A
few examples are shortest-path, when interpreting the weights as lengths;
resistance distance, when thinking of the graph as an electrical network and
the weights are resistances; and the inverse of minimum $st$-cut, when thinking

  It is known that the 3 above-mentioned metrics can all be derived from flows,
when formalizing them as convex optimization problems. This key observation led
us to studying a family of metrics that are derived from flows, which we call
flow metrics, that gives a natural interpolation between the above metrics
using a parameter $p$.
  We make the first steps in studying the flow metrics, and mainly focus on two
aspects: (a) understanding basic properties of the flow metrics, either as an
optimization problem (e.g. finding relations between the flow problem and the
dual potential problem) and as a metric function (e.g. understanding their
structure and geometry); and (b) considering methods for reducing the size of

metrics, and thus attaining a smaller instance that can be used to accelerate
running time of algorithms and reduce their storage requirements.
  Our main result is a lower bound for the number of edges required for a
resistance sparsifier in the worst case. Furthermore, we present a method for
reducing the number of edges in a graph while approximating the flow metrics,
by utilizing a method of [Cohen and Peng, 2015] for reducing the size of

predict the effect of each agent on all other agents. The force law used is
motivated by gravitational force laws and electrical force laws for dipoles. It
assumes that the force between two agents is proportional to the similarity of
attributes, which is implemented mathematically as the dot product of the
vectors representing the attributes of the agents, and the force goes as the
inverse square of the difference in attributes, which is expressed as the
Euclidean distance in attribute space between the two vectors. The force
between the agents may be positive (attractive), zero, or negative (repulsive)
depending on whether the angle between the corresponding vectors is less than,

the agents to become more similar and the corresponding vectors to become more
nearly parallel. Interaction between all agents is allowed unless the distance
between the attributes representing the agents exceeds a confidence limit (the

previous research has focused on the differences between true and false claims
and how they affect evidence retrieval. This paper shows that, compared with
true claims, false claims more frequently contain irrelevant entities which can
distract evidence retrieval model. A BERT-based retrieval model made more
mistakes in retrieving refuting evidence for false claims than supporting
evidence for true claims. When tested with adversarial false claims
(synthetically generated) containing irrelevant entities, the recall of the
retrieval model is significantly lower than that for original claims. These
results suggest that the vanilla BERT-based retrieval model is not robust to
irrelevant entities in the false claims. By augmenting the training data with
synthetic false claims containing irrelevant entities, the trained model
achieved higher evidence recall, including that of false claims with irrelevant
entities. In addition, using separate models to retrieve refuting and
supporting evidence and then aggregating them can also increase the evidence
recall, including that of false claims with irrelevant entities. These results
suggest that we can increase the BERT-based retrieval model's robustness to
false claims with irrelevant entities via data augmentation and model ensemble.

Nielsen-Thurston classification theorem have led to a wide range of practical
applications. Braids have been used to detect coherent structures and mixing
regions in oceanic flows, drive the design of industrial mixing machines,
contextualize the evolution of taffy pullers, and characterize the chaotic
motion of topological defects in active nematics. Mixing plays a central role
in each of these examples, and the braids naturally associated with each system
come equipped with a useful measure of mixing efficiency, the topological
entropy per operation (TEPO). This motivates the following questions. What is
the maximum mixing efficiency for braids, and what braids realize this? The
answer depends on how we define braids. For the standard Artin presentation,
well-known braids with mixing efficiencies related to the golden and silver
ratios have been proven to be maximal. However, it is fruitful to consider
surface braids, a natural generalization of braids, with presentations
constructed from Artin-like braid generators on embedded graphs. In this work,
we introduce an efficient and elegant algorithm for finding the topological
entropy and TEPO of surface braids on any pairing of orientable surface and
planar embeddable graph. Of the myriad possible graphs and surfaces, graphs
that can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$ as a lattice are a simple, highly
symmetric choice, and the braids that result more naturally model the motion of
points on the plane. We extensively search for a maximum mixing efficiency
braid on planar lattice graphs and examine a novel candidate braid, which we
conjecture to have this maximal property.

patterns. Releasing the user trajectories may compromise user privacy.
Therefore, the general practice is to release aggregated location datasets.
However, private information may still be inferred from an aggregated version
of location trajectories. Differential privacy (DP) protects the query output
against inference attacks regardless of background knowledge. This paper
presents a differential privacy-based privacy model that protects the user's
origins and destinations at the aggregated level. This is achieved by injecting
Planar Laplace noise to the user origin and destination GPS points. The noisy
GPS points are then transformed to a link representation using a link-matching
algorithm. Finally, the link trajectories form an aggregated mobility network.
The injected noise level is selected adaptively, by considering the link
density of the location and the functional category of the localized links.
Compared to the different baseline models, including a k-anonymity method, our
differential privacy-based aggregation model offers closer query responses to
the raw data in terms of aggregate statistics at both the network and
trajectory-levels with max 4% deviation from the baseline. Beyond link
aggregation and spatial noise injection, temporal aggregation can also provide
a degree of privacy and a discussion of temporal aggregation requirements is
presented.

We perform microscopic visualizations to verify the occurrence of non-spherical

The introduced valuation principle relies on stochastic ordering so that the
valuation risk-loading, and thus risk premiums, generated by the measure
distortion is an ordered parametric family. The quantile processes are
generated by a composite map consisting of a distribution and a quantile
function. The distribution function accounts for model risk in relation to the
empirical distribution of the risk process, while the quantile function models
the response to the risk source as perceived by, e.g., a market agent. This
gives rise to a system of subjective probability measures that indexes a
stochastic valuation principle susceptible to probability measure distortions.
We use the Tukey-$gh$ family of quantile processes driven by Brownian motion in
an example that demonstrates stochastic ordering. We consider the conditional
expectation under the distorted measure as a member of the time-consistent
class of dynamic valuation principles, and extend it to the setting where the
driving risk process is multivariate. This requires the introduction of a
copula function in the composite map for the construction of quantile
processes, which presents another new element in the risk quantification and
modelling framework based on probability measure distortions induced by
quantile processes.

Unlike dynamic behavior analysis, static analysis is resource-efficient and

  The results demonstrate that features which work well in dynamic analysis are
