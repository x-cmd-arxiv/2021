rectangular arrays and discrepancy minimization too. Near optimal clusters are
obtained with singular value decomposition and with the weighted $k$-means

correspondence analysis with clustering, and in case of edge-weighted graphs, a
normalized Laplacian based clustering. In the latter case it is proved that a
spectral gap between the $(k-1)$th and $k$th smallest positive eigenvalues of
the normalized Laplacian matrix gives rise to a sudden decrease of the inner
cluster variances when the number of clusters of the vertex representatives is
$2^{k-1}$, but only the first $k-1$ eigenvectors, constituting the so-called
Fiedler-carpet, are used in the representation. Application to directed
migration graphs is also discussed.

statistical model for the detection rate conveniently can be used if no

been limited so far by the number of artificial lattice sites that can be
feasibly coupled along the synthetic dimension. Here, we experimentally realise
for the first time a very long and controllable synthetic dimension of atomic
harmonic trap states. To create this, we couple trap states by dynamically
modulating the trapping potential of the atomic cloud with patterned light. By
controlling the detuning between the frequency of the driving potential and the
trapping frequency, we implement a controllable force in the synthetic
dimension. This induces Bloch oscillations in which atoms move periodically up
and down tens of atomic trap states. We experimentally observe the key
characteristics of this behaviour in the real space dynamics of the cloud, and
verify our observations with numerical simulations and semiclassical theory.
This experiment provides an intuitive approach for the manipulation and control
of highly-excited trap states, and sets the stage for the future exploration of
topological physics in higher dimensions.

Solar Orbiter has made the removal of the 180$^\circ$ ambiguity possible using
solely observations obtained from two different vantage points. While the
exploitation of such a possibility is straightforward in principle, it is less
so in practice and it is therefore important to assess the accuracy and
limitations, as a function of both the satellites orbits and measurement
principles. In this work we present a stereoscopic disambiguation method (SDM)
and discuss a thorough testing of its accuracy in applications to modeled
active regions and quiet Sun observations. In a first series of tests, we
employ magnetograms extracted from three different numerical simulations as
test fields, and model observations of the magnetograms from different angles
and distances. In these more idealized tests, the SDM is proven to to reach a
100% disambiguation accuracy when applied to moderately-to-well resolved
fields. Even in the case of disambiguation of quiet Sun magnetograms with
significant under-resolved scale, the SDM provides an accuracy between 82% and
98% depending on the field strength. The accuracy of the SDM is found to be
mostly sensitive to the variable resolution of Solar Orbiter on its highly
elliptic orbit, as well as to the intrinsic scale of the observed field.
Finally, as a more realistic test, we consider magnetograms that are obtained
using a radiative transfer inversion code and the SOPHISM instrument simulator
applied to a 3D simulation of a pore, and present a preliminary discussion of
the effect of the viewing angle on the observed field.

protocol consists of two steps, firstly quantum pre-processing, which applies
local unitary transformations before a measurement, and classical
post-processing that manipulates measurement outcomes to recover noiseless

characterizing a noisy measurement via quantum detector tomography. We show
that the mitigation protocol can maintain a measurement error on multiple

measurements on multiple qubits are suppressed up to a percent level. The
mitigation protocol is realized in IBMQ Sydney and applied to the certification

high variability of the shape and pattern of objects (such as organs or

segmentation, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been introduced to find
high-performance 3D segmentation network architectures. However, because of the
massive computational requirements of 3D data and the discrete optimization
nature of architecture search, previous NAS methods require a long search time
or necessary continuous relaxation, and commonly lead to sub-optimal network
architectures. While one-shot NAS can potentially address these disadvantages,
its application in the segmentation domain has not been well studied in the
expansive multi-scale multi-path search space. To enable one-shot NAS for
medical image segmentation, our method, named HyperSegNAS, introduces a
HyperNet to assist super-net training by incorporating architecture topology
information. Such a HyperNet can be removed once the super-net is trained and
introduces no overhead during architecture search. We show that HyperSegNAS
yields better performing and more intuitive architectures compared to the
previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation networks; furthermore, it can
quickly and accurately find good architecture candidates under different
computing constraints. Our method is evaluated on public datasets from the

the white dwarf that explodes to create SNIa depends on the values of the
constants at the epoch the SNIa is formed. We show that the SNeIa luminosities
were up to about four times higher in the past than they are now. Thus, the
luminosity distance estimation of the earliest SNeIa could be off by up to a
factor of two. Cosmological parameters, determined with this correction applied
to the redshift vs. distance modulus database (Pantheon SNeIa), are not very
different from those from the standard $\Lambda $CDM model without this

elliptic estimates, where constraining the values of the field to lie in a cone
compensates for the lack of ellipticity of the differential operator. We give a
series of new examples of this phenomenon for a geometric class of cones and
operators such as the divergence or the curl. One of our main findings is that
the maximal gain of integrability is tied to both the differential operator and
the cone, contradicting in particular a recent conjecture from
arXiv:2106.03077. This extends the recent theory of compensated integrability
due to D. Serre. In particular, we find a new family of integrands that are

cohomological complex obtained from localization of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM on
simply-connected compact four-manifolds with a $T^2$-action. Knowledge of said
index is essential to compute the perturbative part of the partition function
for the theory. In the topologically twisted case, the complex is elliptic and
its index can be computed in a standard way using the Atiyah-Bott localization
formula. Recently, a framework for more general types of twisting, so-called
cohomological twisting, was introduced for which the complex turns out to be
only transversally elliptic. While the index of such a complex has been
computed for some cases where the manifold can be lifted to a Sasakian
$S^1$-fibration in five dimensions, a general four-dimensional treatment was
still lacking. We provide a formal, purely four-dimensional treatment of the
cohomological complex, showing that the Laplacian part can be globally split
off while the remaining part can be trivialized uniquely in the
group-direction. This ultimately produces a simple formula for the index
applicable for any compact simply-connected four-manifold. Finally, the index
formula is applied to examples on $S^4$, $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and $\mathbb{F}^1$.
For the latter, we use the result to compute the perturbative partition
function.

human population. Researchers introduce appropriate reward mechanisms to
incentivize agents to report accurately. In particular, this paper focuses on
Peer-Based Mechanisms (PBMs). We observe that with PBMs, crowdsourcing systems
may not be fair, i.e., agents may not receive the deserved rewards despite
investing efforts and reporting truthfully. Unfair rewards for the agents may
discourage participation. This paper aims to build a general framework that
assures fairness for PBMs in temporal settings, i.e., settings that prefer
early reports. Towards this, we introduce two general notions of fairness for
PBMs, namely gamma-fairness and qualitative fairness. To satisfy these notions,
our framework provides trustworthy agents with additional chances of pairing.
We introduce Temporal Reputation Model (TERM) to quantify agents'
trustworthiness across tasks. With TERM as the key constituent, we present our
iterative framework, REFORM, that can adopt the reward scheme of any existing
PBM. We demonstrate REFORM's significance by deploying the framework with
RPTSC's reward scheme. Specifically, we prove that REFORM with RPTSC
considerably improves fairness; while incentivizing truthful and early reports.
We conduct synthetic simulations and show that our framework provides improved
fairness over RPTSC.

Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. In the simplest limit, the combined signal from
the scattered radio and cosmic microwave background exhibits a null at around
$\nu \simeq 735$ MHz. Here, we show that kinematic and relativistic temperature
corrections to this radio SZ signal are easily calculable. We treat both the
cluster and observer motion, and the scattering of anisotropies in the radio
background, highlighting how the spectrum of the radio SZ effect is affected in
each case. Although relativistic temperature corrections only enter at the
level of a few percent, our expressions allow high-precision modelling of these
terms. By measuring the SZ signal around the radio null, one is in principle
able to place constraints on the properties of a cosmological radio background.
A combination with standard SZ measurements from large cluster samples could
provide a promising avenue towards breaking degeneracies between different
contributions. Stacking analyses can reduce the effect of kinematic corrections
and dipolar anisotropies in the radio background, thereby providing a way to
constrain the redshift dependence of the average radio background. Our
qualitative discussion is meant to give an analytic understanding of the
various effects and also motivate further studies with the aim to obtain
quantitative forecasts of their observability. At this stage, a detection of
the corrections seems rather futuristic, but the advent of large SZ and X-ray
cluster samples could drastically improve our ability to disentangle various
effects.

in spiral spin liquids -- the momentum vortex -- and reveal its dominant role
in shaping the low energy physics of such systems. Spiral spin liquids are a
class of classical spin liquids featuring sub-extensively degenerate ground
states. They are distinct from spin liquids on geometrically frustrated
lattices, in which the ground state degeneracy is extensive and connected by
local spin flips. Despite a handful of experimental realizations and many
theoretical studies, a concrete physical picture of their spin liquidity has
not been established so far. In this work, we study a 2D spiral spin liquid
model to answer this question. We find that the local momentum vector field can
carry topological defects in the form of vortices, which, however, have very
different properties from the commonly known spin vortices. The fluctuations of
such vortices lead the system into a liquid phase at intermediate temperatures.
Furthermore, the effective low energy theory of such vortices indicates their
equivalence to quadrupoles of fractons in a rank-2 U(1) gauge theory or,
alternatively, to quadrupoles of disclinations in elasticity theory. At very
low temperatures, the system freezes into a glassy state in which these
vortices form a rigid network with straight-line domain walls. Our work sheds
light on the nature of spiral spin liquids and also paves the way toward
understanding their quantum limit.

linear differential operator with constant coefficients, we study a class of
variational problems whose regularizing terms depend on the operator.
Precisely, the regularizers are integrals of spatially inhomogeneous integrands
with convex dependence on the differential operator applied to the image
function. The setting is made rigorous by means of the theory of Radon measures
and of suitable function spaces modeled on $BV$. We prove the lower
semicontinuity of the functionals at stake and existence of minimizers for the
corresponding variational problems. Then, we embed the latter into a bilevel
scheme in order to automatically compute the space-dependent regularization
parameters, thus allowing for good flexibility and preservation of details in
the reconstructed image. We establish existence of optima for the scheme and we
finally substantiate its feasibility by numerical examples in image denoising.
The cases that we treat are Huber versions of the first and second order total
variation with both the Huber and the regularization parameter being spatially
dependent. Notably the spatially dependent version of second order total
variation produces high quality reconstructions when compared to
regularizations of similar type, and the introduction of the spatially
dependent Huber parameter leads to a further enhancement of the image details.

super-resolution models perform poorly in real scenarios since the remarkable
domain gap between the real images and the synthesized training pairs. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel domain-adaptive degradation network for
face super-resolution in the wild. This degradation network predicts a flow
field along with an intermediate low resolution image. Then, the degraded
counterpart is generated by warping the intermediate image. With the preference
of capturing motion blur, such a model performs better at preserving identity
consistency between the original images and the degraded. We further present
the self-conditioned block for super-resolution network. This block takes the
input image as a condition term to effectively utilize facial structure
information, eliminating the reliance on explicit priors, e.g. facial landmarks
or boundary. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CelebA and
real-world face dataset. The former demonstrates the powerful generative
ability of our proposed architecture while the latter shows great identity
consistency and perceptual quality in real-world images.

confidence sets to frequentist ones. We define admissible solutions to
inference problems, noting that Bayesian solutions are admissible. We give
seven weaker common-sense criteria for solutions to inference problems, all
failed by these frequentist methods but satisfied by any admissible method. We
note that pseudo-Bayesian methods made by handicapping Bayesian methods to
satisfy criteria on type I error rate makes them frequentist not Bayesian in
nature.
  We give five examples showing the differences between Bayesian and
frequentist methods; the first requiring little calculus, the second showing in
abstract what is wrong with these frequentist methods, the third to illustrate
information conservation, the fourth to show that the same problems arise in
everyday statistical problems, and the fifth to illustrate how on some
real-life inference problems Bayesian methods require less data than fixed
sample-size (resp. pseudo-Bayesian) frequentist hypothesis testing by factors
exceeding 3000 (resp 300) without recourse to informative priors.
  To address the issue of different parties with opposing interests reaching
agreement on a prior, we illustrate the beneficial effects of a Bayesian ""Let
the data decide"" policy both on results under a wide variety of conditions and
on motivation to reach a common prior by consent.
  We show that in general the frequentist confidence level contains less
relevant Shannon information than the Bayesian posterior, and give an example
where no deterministic frequentist critical regions give any relevant
information even though the Bayesian posterior contains up to the maximum
possible amount. In contrast use of the Bayesian prior allows construction of
non-deterministic critical regions for which the Bayesian posterior can be
recovered from the frequentist confidence.

upscaled to the space-time scale of a hypothetical measurement through

local balance equation which allow us to derive expressions for the flow
velocity and the intrinsic diffusion coefficient in terms of averaged
microscopic quantities. The latter are further used to verify the CGST-GRW
numerical approach. The upscaling approach is applied to biodegradation
processes in saturated aquifers and variably saturated soils and the CGST
averages are compared to classical volume averages. One finds that if the
process is characterized by slow variations in time, as in homogeneous reaction
systems, the differences between the two averages are negligible. Instead, the
differences are significant and can be extremely large in simulations of

VX Sgr is a cool, evolved, and luminous red star whose stellar
parameters are difficult to determine, which affects its classification. Aims.
We aim to spatially resolve the photospheric extent as well as the
circumstellar environment. Methods. We used interferometric observations
obtained with the MATISSE instrument in the L (3 to 4 {\mu}m), M (4.5 to 5
{\mu}m), and N (8 to 13 {\mu}m) bands. We reconstructed monochromatic images
using the MIRA software. We used 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations
carried out with CO5BOLD and a uniform disc model to estimate the apparent
diameter and interpret the stellar surface structures. Moreover, we employed
the radiative transfer codes Optim3D and Radmc3D to compute the spectral energy
distribution for the L, M, and N bands, respectively. Results. MATISSE
observations unveil, for the first time, the morphology of VX Sgr across the L,
M, and N bands. The reconstructed images show a complex morphology with
brighter areas whose characteristics depend on the wavelength probed. We
measured the angular diameter as a function of the wavelength and showed that
the photospheric extent in the L and M bands depends on the opacity through the
atmosphere. In addition to this, we also concluded that the observed
photospheric inhomogeneities can be interpreted as convection-related surface
structures. The comparison in the N band yielded a qualitative agreement
between the N band spectrum and simple dust radiative transfer simulations.
However, it is not possible to firmly conclude on the interpretation of the
current data because of the difficulty in constraing the model parameters using
the limited accuracy of our absolute flux calibration. Conclusions. MATISSE
observations and the derived reconstructed images unveil the appearance of the
stellar surface and circumstellar environment across a very large spectral
domain for the first time.

in ways governed by the underlying interaction and symmetry. Understanding this
phenomenon, also called quantum scrambling, is a prerequisite for employing
interacting systems for quantum information processing. The character and
direction dependence of quantum scrambling can be inferred from the
out-of-time-ordered commutators (OTOCs) containing information on correlation
buildup and entanglement spreading. Employing OTOC, we study and quantify the
directionality of quantum information propagation in oxide-based helical spin
systems hosting a spin-driven ferroelectric order. In these systems,
magnetoelectricity permits the spin dynamics and associated information content
to be controlled by an electric field coupled to the emergent ferroelectric
order. We show that topologically nontrivial quantum phases, such as chiral or
helical spin ordering, allows for electric-field controlled anisotropic
scrambling and a direction-dependent buildup of quantum correlations. Based on
general symmetry considerations, we find that starting from a pure state (e.g.,
the ground state) or a finite temperature state is essential for observing
directional asymmetry in scrambling. In the systematic numerical studies of
OTOC, we quantify the directional asymmetry of the scrambling and verify the
conjectured form of the OTOC around the ballistic wavefront. The obtained
direction-dependent butterfly velocity $v_{\mathrm{B}}(\mathbf{n})$ provides
information on the speed of the ballistic wavefront. In general, our
calculations show an early-time power-law behavior of OTOC, as expected from an
analytic expansion for small times. The long-time behavior of OTOC reveals the
importance of (non-)integrability of the underlying Hamiltonian as well as the
implications of conserved quantities such as the $z$-projection of the total
spin.

frequently discussed as prioritization criteria in biodiversity conservation.
They rank species according to their contribution to overall diversity by
taking into account the unique and shared evolutionary history of each species
as indicated by its placement in an underlying phylogenetic tree.
Traditionally, phylogenetic trees were inferred from single genes and the
resulting gene trees were assumed to be a valid estimate for the species tree,
i.e., the ""true"" evolutionary history of the species under consideration.
However, nowadays it is common to sequence whole genomes of hundreds or
thousands of genes, and it is often the case that conflicting genealogical
histories exist in different genes throughout the genome, resulting in
discordance between individual gene trees and the species tree. Here, we
analyze the effects of gene and species tree discordance on prioritization
decisions based on the FP index. In particular, we consider the ranking order
of taxa induced by (i) the FP index on a species tree, and (ii) the expected FP
index across all gene tree histories associated with the species tree. On one
hand, we show that for particular tree shapes, the two rankings always
coincide. On the other hand, we show that for all leaf numbers greater than or
equal to five, there exist species trees for which the two rankings differ.
Finally, we illustrate the variability in the rankings obtained from the FP
index across different gene tree and species tree estimates for an empirical
multilocus mammal data set.

vertices of the core with degree $2$, is such that the sum of the degree of its
vertices exceeds that of a trivalent map by a term of order
$\sqrt{\mathrm{s}_{n}^{3}/n}$; in particular they are trivalent with high
probability when $\mathrm{s}_{n} \ll n^{1/3}$. This enables us to identify a
mesoscopic scale $\sqrt{n/\mathrm{s}_n}$ at which the scaling limits of these
random maps can be seen as the local limit of their kernels, which is the dual
of the UIPT in the planar case and the infinite three-regular tree in the
unicellular case, where each edge is replaced by an independent (biased)
Brownian tree with two marked points.

derive the joint distribution of Busemann functions across all directions. The
set of directions where the Busemann process is discontinuous, denoted
$\Theta$, provides detailed information about the uniqueness and coalescence of
semi-infinite geodesics. The uncountable set of initial points in BLPP gives
rise to new phenomena not seen in discrete models. For example, in every
direction $\theta > 0$, there exists a countably infinite set of initial points
$\mathbf x$ such that there exist two $\theta$-directed geodesics that split
but eventually coalesce. Further, we define the competition interface in BLPP
and show that the set of initial points whose competition interface is
nontrivial has Hausdorff dimension $\frac{1}{2}$. From each of these
exceptional points, there exists a random direction $\theta \in \Theta$ for
which there exists two $\theta$-directed semi-infinite geodesics that split
immediately and never meet again. Conversely, when $\theta \in \Theta$, from
every initial point $\mathbf x \in \mathbb Z \times \mathbb R$, there exists
two $\theta$-directed semi-infinite geodesics that eventually separate.
Whenever $\theta \notin \Theta$, all $\theta$-directed semi-infinite geodesics
coalesce.

suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and healthy individuals has been
a mainstay of clinical neuroscience for decades. However, recent meta- and
mega-analyses have raised concerns regarding the replicability and clinical
relevance of brain alterations in depression. Methods: Here, we systematically
investigate healthy controls and MDD patients across a comprehensive range of
modalities including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion
tensor imaging, functional task-based and resting-state MRI under near-ideal
conditions. To this end, we quantify the upper bounds of univariate effect
sizes, predictive utility, and distributional dissimilarity in a fully
harmonized cohort of N=1,809 participants. We compare the results to an MDD
polygenic risk score (PRS) and environmental variables. Results: The upper
bound of the effect sizes range from partial eta squared = .004 to .017,
distributions overlap between 89% and 95%, with classification accuracies
ranging between 54% and 55% across neuroimaging modalities. This pattern
remains virtually unchanged when considering only acutely or chronically
depressed patients. Differences are comparable to those found for PRS, but
substantially smaller than for environmental variables. Discussion: We provide
a large-scale, multimodal analysis of univariate biological differences between
MDD patients and controls and show that even under near-ideal conditions and
for maximum biological differences, deviations are extremely small and
similarity dominates. We sketch an agenda for a new focus of future research in
biological psychiatry facilitating quantitative, theory-driven research, an
emphasis on computational psychiatry and multivariate machine learning
approaches, as well as the utilization of ecologically valid phenotyping.

revealed that most gLSBGs do not deviate from the Tully-Fisher relation. We
discovered compact elliptical (cE) satellites in 2 out of these 7 galaxies.
Provided the low statistical frequencies of gLSBGs and cEs, the chance
alignment is improbable, so it can indicate that gLSBGs and cE are evolutionary
connected and gives evidence in favor of the major merger formation scenario.
Other formation paths of gLSBGs are also discussed.

thermal fluctuations indicating that the mixed sample is marginally stable in
the full detected temperature range. The enthalpy of mixing is negative, which
points to an ordered arrangement of the Co(II) and Fe(II) ions in the solid
solution CoFeNb. The negative values of the entropy of mixing are explained by
considering the enhanced rigidity of the crystal lattice of the solid solution
sample. To extract the magnetic contribution to the heat capacity an approach
based on a reasonable frequency spectrum is adopted. Taking advantage of the
in-field heat capacity measurements MCE was described in terms of the
isothermal entropy change $\Delta S_\mathrm{M}$ and the adiabatic temperature
change $\Delta T_\mathrm{ad}$. The magnitudes of these quantities are typical

is proposed for $\boldsymbol{G}_N$-coset codes that implements
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding with an adaptive complexity for transmission
over binary-input AWGN channels. Unlike bit-flip decoders, no outer code is
needed to terminate decoding; therefore, SCOS also applies to
$\boldsymbol{G}_N$-coset codes modified with dynamic frozen bits. The average
complexity is close to that of successive cancellation (SC) decoding at
practical frame error rates (FERs) for codes with wide ranges of rate and
lengths up to $512$ bits, which perform within $0.25$ dB or less from the
random coding union bound and outperform Reed--Muller codes under ML decoding
by up to $0.5$ dB. Simulations illustrate simultaneous gains for SCOS over
SC-Fano, SC stack (SCS) and SC list (SCL) decoding in FER and the average
complexity at various SNR regimes. SCOS is further extended by forcing it to
look for candidates satisfying a threshold on the likelihood, thereby
outperforming basic SCOS under complexity constraints. The modified SCOS
enables strong error-detection capability without the need for an outer code.
In particular, the $(128, 64)$ PAC code under modified SCOS provides gains in
overall and undetected FER compared to CRC-aided polar codes under SCL/dynamic
SC flip decoding at high SNR.

the Euclidean evolution while the other regions experience the Lorentzian

2$\cdot$10$^{15}$ n$_{\mathrm{eq}}$/cm$^2$. Depletion depth was measured with
Edge-TCT. Effective space charge concentration $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ was estimated
from the dependence of depletion depth on bias voltage and studied as a
function of neutron fluence. Dependence of $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ on fluence
changes with initial acceptor concentration in agreement with other
measurements with p-type silicon. Long term accelerated annealing study of
$N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and detector current up to 1280 minutes at 60$^\circ$C was
made. It was found that $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and current in reverse biased
detector behaves as expected for irradiated silicon.

of two standardisable rulers: the sound horizon scale, $r_s$, and the

last decade have focused on the first scale, recent work has emphasised that
the second can provide an independent source of information about the expansion
rate of the universe. Recent approaches to obtain a sound-horizon-independent
measurement of $H_0$ from the equality scale have avoided $r_s$-based
information by removing the sound-horizon-calibrating prior on the baryon
density. We present a new method to marginalise over $r_s$; this allows baryon
information to be retained enabling tighter parameter constraints. For a
Euclid-like spectroscopic survey, we forecast sound-horizon-independent $H_0$
constraints of $\sigma_{H_0} = 0.7\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ for our method
using the equality scale, compared with $\sigma_{H_0} = 0.5\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\
Mpc^{-1}}$ from the sound horizon. Upcoming equality scale $H_0$ measurements
thus can be highly competitive, although we caution that the impact of
observational systematics on such measurements still needs to be investigated
in detail. Applying our new approach to the BOSS power spectrum gives $H_0 =
69.5^{+3.0}_{-3.5}\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ from equality alone, somewhat
tighter than previous constraints. Consistency of $r_s$- and $k_{\rm eq}$-based
$H_0$ measurements can provide a valuable internal consistency test of the

fictitious lattice structures by coupling the discrete degrees of freedom of a
physical system, such as the quantized modes of an electromagnetic cavity or
the internal states of an atom. This method enables the study of static and
dynamical Bloch band properties in the absence of a real periodic lattice
structure. So far, the vast majority of implementations have focused on linear
and conservative processes, with the potentially rich physics and opportunities
offered by nonlinearities and dissipation remaining largely unexplored. Here,
we theoretically and experimentally investigate the complex interplay between
Bloch band transport, nonlinearity, and dissipation, exploring how a synthetic
dimension realised in the frequency space of a coherently-driven optical
resonator influences the dynamics of nonlinear waves of the system. In
particular, we observe and study nonlinear dissipative Bloch oscillations
occurring along the synthetic frequency dimension, sustained by localized
dissipative structures (solitons) that persist endlessly in the resonator. The
unique properties of the dissipative soliton states can extend the effective
size of the synthetic dimension far beyond that achieved in the linear regime,
as well as enable long-lived Bloch oscillations and high-resolution probing of
the underlying band structure. Besides representing the first experimental
study of the interplay between Bloch oscillations and dissipative solitons, our
work establishes Kerr resonators as an ideal platform for the study of
nonlinear dynamics in long-scale synthetic dimensions, with promising
applications in topological photonics.

framework, termed as VolumeGAN, for high-fidelity 3D-aware image synthesis,
through explicitly learning a structural representation and a textural

The feature field is further accumulated into a 2D feature map as the textural
representation, followed by a neural renderer for appearance synthesis. Such a
design enables independent control of the shape and the appearance. Extensive
experiments on a wide range of datasets show that our approach achieves
sufficiently higher image quality and better 3D control than the previous

twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has established moir\'e quantum matter as a
new platform to explore interaction-driven and topological quantum phenomena.
Multitudes of phases have been realized in moir\'e systems, but surprisingly,
robust superconductivity has been one of the least common of all, initially
found in MATBG and only more recently also in magic-angle twisted trilayer
graphene (MATTG). While MATBG and MATTG share some similar characteristics,
they also exhibit substantial differences, such as in their response to
external electric and magnetic fields. This raises the question of whether they
are simply two separate unique systems, or whether they form part of a broader
family of superconducting materials. Here, we report the experimental
realization of magic-angle twisted 4-layer and 5-layer graphene (MAT4G and
MAT5G, respectively), which turn out to be superconductors, hence establishing
alternating-twist magic-angle multilayer graphene as a robust family of moir\'e
superconductors. The members of this family have flat bands in their electronic
structure as a common feature, suggesting their central role in the observed
robust superconductivity. On the other hand, there are also important
variations across the family, such as different symmetries for members with
even and odd number of layers. However, our measurements in parallel magnetic
fields, in particular the investigation of Pauli limit violation and
spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking, reveal that the most pronounced
distinction is between the N=2 and N>2-layer structures. Our results expand the

field galaxies and in groups. The method is designed to work with samples, such
as local photometric redshift catalogues, that do not have full spectroscopic
coverage, but for which some redshift or distance information is available. It
consists of identifying the galaxies most likely to be centrals, and using the
clustering signal around them as a template to iteratively decompose the full
population into satellite and central populations. In that sense it is similar
to performing crowded-field photometry, after having first used isolated stars
to determine the point spread function of the image. The method does not
identify individual satellites or centrals conclusively, but assigns a
probability to each galaxy of being one or the other. Averaged over a large
sample, it provides a statistical estimate of satellite abundance, even in
crowded fields with large redshift uncertainties. We test the method using data
from the COSMOS field, which includes a large set of local objects with
accurate photometric redshifts. We measure satellite abundance as a function of
central stellar or halo mass, as well as the satellite luminosity function, and
find results consistent with previous studies, but extending over a broader
range of central masses. We also consider a number of possible systematic
uncertainties in the method, and show that they are generally smaller than our
random errors. Having presented the method in this paper, we will use it to
study the properties of the satellite populations in a forthcoming one.

not yet demonstrated on-par ability as ConvNets in high-resolution image
generative modeling. In this paper, we seek to explore using pure transformers
to build a generative adversarial network for high-resolution image synthesis.
To this end, we believe that local attention is crucial to strike the balance
between computational efficiency and modeling capacity. Hence, the proposed
generator adopts Swin transformer in a style-based architecture. To achieve a
larger receptive field, we propose double attention which simultaneously
leverages the context of the local and the shifted windows, leading to improved
generation quality. Moreover, we show that offering the knowledge of the
absolute position that has been lost in window-based transformers greatly
benefits the generation quality. The proposed StyleSwin is scalable to high
resolutions, with both the coarse geometry and fine structures benefit from the
strong expressivity of transformers. However, blocking artifacts occur during
high-resolution synthesis because performing the local attention in a
block-wise manner may break the spatial coherency. To solve this, we
empirically investigate various solutions, among which we find that employing a
wavelet discriminator to examine the spectral discrepancy effectively
suppresses the artifacts. Extensive experiments show the superiority over prior
transformer-based GANs, especially on high resolutions, e.g., 1024x1024. The
StyleSwin, without complex training strategies, excels over StyleGAN on
CelebA-HQ 1024, and achieves on-par performance on FFHQ-1024, proving the
promise of using transformers for high-resolution image generation. The code

from the database of WFC3 point-spread functions (PSFs) provided by Space
Telescope Science Institute and develop a set of morphology-significance
criteria for pre-selection of reference frames to improve RDI subtraction. RDI
with this PSF library results in a detection of PDS 70 b at a S/N of 5.3.
Astrometry and photometry of PDS 70 b are calibrated using a forward-modeling
method and injection-recovery tests, resulting in a separation of $186 \pm 13$
mas, a position angle of $142 \pm 5^\circ$, and an H$\alpha$ flux of $(1.7 \pm

with RDI can be attributed to the $\sim$100 times lower peak-to-background
ratios of the reference PSFs compared to the ADI PSFs. Building a high-quality
reference library with WFC3 will provide unique opportunities to study
accretion variability on short timescales not limited by roll angle scheduling

wavefunctions due to various kinds of perturbations, which require sums over an
infinite number of bands. Here, we introduce the concept of the Wannier
function perturbation, which provides a localized representation of
wavefunction perturbations. Wannier function perturbation theory allows
efficient calculation of numerous quantities involving wavefunction
perturbation, among which we provide three applications. First, we calculate
the temperature-dependent indirect optical absorption spectra of silicon near
the absorption edge nonadiabatically, i.e., differentiating phonon-absorption
and phonon-emission processes, and without arbitrary temperature-dependent
shifts in energy. Second, we establish a theory to calculate the shift spin
conductivity without any band-truncation error. Unlike the shift charge
conductivity, an exact calculation of the shift spin conductivity is not
possible within the conventional Wannier function methods because it cannot be
obtained from geometric quantities for low-energy bands. We apply the theory to
monolayer WTe$_2$. Third, we calculate the spin Hall conductivity of the same
material again without any band-truncation error. Wannier function perturbation
theory is a versatile method that can be readily applied to calculate a wide

challenges of quintessence model building in any numerically controlled regime
of the moduli space of string theory. We argue that a working quintessence
model requires a leading order non-supersymmetric (near) Minkowski vacuum with
an axionic flat direction. This axion, when lifted by subdominant
non-perturbative effects, could drive hilltop quintessence only for highly
tuned initial conditions and a very low inflationary scale. Our analysis has
two important implications. Firstly, scenarios which are in agreement with the
swampland conjectures, such as those that include runaways, or supersymmetric
AdS and Minkowski vacua, cannot give rise to phenomenologically viable
quintessence with full computational control. This raises doubts on the
validity of the swampland dS conjecture since it would imply a strong tension
between quantum gravity and observations. Secondly, if data should prefer
dynamical dark energy, axion models based on alignment mechanisms look more
promising than highly contrived hilltop scenarios.

coincidence between the two. The thermal freeze-out of dark matter annihilating
into meta-stable dark partners sets the dark matter relic abundance while
providing the out-of-equilibrium condition for baryogenesis. The meta-stable
state triggers baryon asymmetry production by its decay well after the
freeze-out and potentially induces a period of early matter domination before
its decay. The dark matter and baryon abundances are related through number
conservation within the dark sector (cogenesis). The ""coincidence"" is a natural
outcome with GeV- to TeV-scale symmetric dark matter and the dark sector's
interactions with the Standard Model quarks. We present a UV-complete model and
explore its phenomenological predictions, including dark matter direct
detection signals, LHC signatures of new massive particles with color charges
and long-lived particles with displaced vertices, dark matter-induced nucleon
conversions, (exotic) dark matter indirect detection signals, and effects on
the cosmological matter power spectrum. As a side result, we provide a novel
analytical treatment for dark sector freeze-out, which may prove useful in the

significantly detected as a point source at the optical position with a total
of 358$^{+19}_{-19}$ net counts using the EPIC instrument. By fitting a
power-law plus Galactic absorption model to the observed spectra, we obtain a
spectral slope of $\Gamma=1.45^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$. The derived optical-to-X-ray
spectral slope $\alpha_{\rm{ox}}$ is $-2.07^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$, suggesting that
the X-ray emission of J0439+1634 is weaker by a factor of 18 than the

X-ray weak BAL quasar at $z>6$ has been observed spectroscopically. Its X-ray
weakness is consistent with the properties of BAL quasars at lower redshift. By
fitting a model including an intrinsic absorption component, we obtain
intrinsic column densities of

luminosity is derived as $(9.4-15.1)\times10^{43}\,\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$, after
correcting for lensing magnification ($\mu=51.3$). The absorbed power-law model
fitting indicates that J0439+1634 is the highest redshift obscured quasar with
a direct measurement of the absorbing column density. The intrinsic high column
density absorption can reduce the X-ray luminosity by a factor of $3-7$, which
also indicates that this quasar could be a candidate of intrinsically X-ray

mass-distribution of formed stars, i.e. on the stellar initial mass function
(IMF). The luminous massive stars dominate the observed photon flux while the
dim low-mass stars dominate the mass in the freshly formed population. Errors
in the number ratio of the massive to low-mass stars lead to errors in SFR

clusters is equal to the galaxy-wide IMF (gwIMF) which, by implication, would

the opportunity of a new detailed study of the Milky Way stellar population.
Because it includes both dwarf and giant stars, it also enables the analysis of
any potential bias induced by the Pristine selection process. Based on Gaia
EDR3, the orbital analysis of this Pristine$-$Espadons sample shows that it is
composed of 65 halo stars and 67 disc stars. After a general assessment of the

of our very metal-poor subsample is carbon normal, we also find that 14 stars

should identify the UV cutoff with the `species scale', and give a general
algorithm to calculate it in the case of multiple towers becoming light. One
then obtains an upper bound on the characteristic mass scale of the tower in
terms of the IR cut-off, given by $M_{\text{tower}}\lesssim
(\Lambda_{\text{IR}})^{2\alpha_D}$ in Planck units, with
$\alpha_D=(D-2+p)/2p(D-1)$, where $p$ depends on the density of states.
Identifying the IR cut-off with a (non-vanishing) curvature in AdS one
reproduces the statement of the AdS Distance Conjecture (ADC), also giving an
explicit lower bound for the $\alpha$ exponent. In particular, we find that the
CEB implies $\alpha \geq1/2$ in any dimension if there is a single KK tower,
both in AdS and dS vacua. However values $\alpha <1/2$ are allowed if the
particle tower is multiple or has a string component. We also consider the CKN
constraint coming from avoiding gravitational collapse which further requires
in general $\alpha \geq 1/D$ for the lightest tower. We analyse the case of the
DGKT-CFI class of Type IIA orientifold models and show it has both particle and
string towers below the species scale, so that a careful analysis of how the
ADC is defined is needed. We find that this class of models obey but do not
saturate the CEB. The UV/IR constraints found apply to both AdS and dS vacua.
We comment on possible applications of these ideas to the dS Swampland

efficiently than all other thermodynamic cycles operating as heat engines in

in the analysis of Belenchia et al. and also showing that their conclusions are
valid in much more general circumstances. As a by-product of our analysis, we
show that under the protocols of the gedankenexperiment, there is no clear
distinction between entanglement mediated by the Newtonian gravitational field
of a body and entanglement mediated by on-shell gravitons emitted by the body.
This suggests that Newtonian entanglement implies the existence of graviton
entanglement and supports the view that the experimental discovery of Newtonian
entanglement may be viewed as implying the existence of the graviton.

in the context of the Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. These corners naturally arise
in the computation of Hartle-Hawking wave functionals and reduced density
matrices, and give origin to AdS spacetimes with conical defects. This set up
constitutes a lab to manifestly realize many aspects of the construction
recently proposed in \cite{Botta2020}. In particular, it can be shown that the
Hayward term is required to reproduce the flat spectrum of R\'enyi entropies in
the Fursaev's derivation, and furthermore, the action with an extra Nambu-Goto
term associated to the Dong's cosmic brane prescription appears naturally. On
the other hand, the conical defect coming from Hayward term contribution are
subtly different from the defects set as pointlike \emph{sources} studied
previously in the literature. We study and analyze these quantitative
differences in the path integral and compare the results. Also study previous
proposals on the superselection sectors, and by computing the density operator
we obtain the Shannon entropy and some novel results on the symmetry group
representations and edge modes. It also makes contact with the so-called
\emph{defect operator} found in \cite{Jafferis2019}. Lastly, we obtain the area
operator as part of the gravitational modular Hamiltonian, in agreement with
the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh proposal.

recent studies agree that fragmentation of primordial gas gives a broader IMF
than the initially suggested singular star per halo. In this study we introduce
sink particle mergers into Arepo, to perform the first resolution study for
primordial star formation simulations and present the first Population III
simulations to run up to densities of 10-6g cm-3 for hundreds of years after
the formation of sink particles. The total number of sinks formed increases
with increasing sink particle creation density, without achieving numerical
convergence. The total mass in sinks remains invariant to the maximum
resolution and is safe to estimate using low resolution studies. This results
in an IMF that shifts towards lower masses with increasing resolution. Greater
numbers of sinks cause increased fragmentation-induced starvation of the most
massive sink, yielding lower accretion rates, masses and ionising photons
emitted per second. The lack of convergence up to densities 2 orders of
magnitudes higher than all relevant chemical reactions suggests that the number
of sinks will continue to grow with increasing resolution until H2 is fully
dissociated and the collapse becomes almost adiabatic at 10-4g cm-3. These
results imply that many Population III studies utilising sink particles have
produced IMFs which have overestimated the masses of primordial stars, and
underestimated the number of stars formed. In the highest resolution runs,
sinks with masses capable of surviving until the present day had an ejection
fraction of 0.21.

used Chandrasekhar formula. However, in some circumstances, Chandrasekhar's
local and uniform approximations can break down severely. An astrophysically
important example is the ""core stalling"" phenomenon seen in N-body simulations
of massive perturber inspiralling into the near-harmonic potential of a stellar
system's constant-density core (and possibly also in direct observations of
dwarf galaxies with globular clusters). In this paper we use the linearized
collisionless Boltzmann equation to calculate the global response of a cored
galaxy to the presence of a massive perturber. We evaluate the density
deformation, or wake, due to the perturber and study its geometrical structure
to better understand the phenomenon of core stalling. We also evaluate the
dynamical friction torque acting on perturber from the Lynden-Bell--Kalnajs
(LBK) formula. In agreement with past work, we find that the dynamical friction
force arising from corotating resonances is greatly weakened, relative to the
Chandrasekhar formula, inside a constant density core. In contrast to past
work, however, we find that a population of previously neglected high-order and
non-corotating resonances sustain a minimum level of frictional torque at ~10 %
of the torque from Chandrasekhar formula. This suggests that complete core
stalling likely requires phenomena beyond the LBK approach; we discuss several
possible explanations. Additionally, to study core stalling for multiple
perturbers, we investigate approximate secular dynamical interactions (akin to
Lidov-Kozai dynamics) between two perturbers orbiting a cored stellar system
and derive a criterion for instability arising due to their close encounters.

however, classical linear-subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) of low dimension
might yield inaccurate results. Thus, the concept of classical linear-subspace
ROMs has to be extended to more general concepts, like Model Order Reduction
(MOR) on manifolds. Moreover, as we are dealing with Hamiltonian systems, it is
crucial that the underlying symplectic structure is preserved in the reduced
model, as otherwise it could become unphysical in the sense that the energy is
not conserved or stability properties are lost. To the best of our knowledge,
existing literature addresses either MOR on manifolds or symplectic model
reduction for Hamiltonian systems, but not their combination. In this work, we
bridge the two aforementioned approaches by providing a novel projection
technique called symplectic manifold Galerkin (SMG), which projects the
Hamiltonian system onto a nonlinear symplectic trial manifold such that the
reduced model is again a Hamiltonian system. We derive analytical results such
as stability, energy-preservation and a rigorous a-posteriori error bound.
Moreover, we construct a weakly symplectic deep convolutional autoencoder as a
computationally practical approach to approximate a nonlinear symplectic trial
manifold. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the ability of the method to
outperform (non-)structure-preserving linear-subspace ROMs and
non-structure-preserving MOR on manifold techniques.

the introduction of suitable cross-correlation constraints imposes the crucial
""single-structure"" criteria. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for
two applications: reflectivity contrast for optical sensing, and maximum
efficiency for optical beam switching. Our approach generalizes to any active
or multi-functional design in linear optics.

characterize the dependence of the normalized average fluid-particle force
$\langle F \rangle$ on the volume fraction of the dispersed solid phase and on
the rheology of the complex fluid matrix. Here we use direct numerical
simulations (DNS) to study the creeping flow ($Re\ll 1$) of viscoelastic fluids
through static random arrays of monodisperse spherical particles using a finite
volume Navier-Stokes/Cauchy momentum solver. The numerical study consists of
$N=150$ different systems, in which the normalized average fluid-particle force
$\langle F \rangle$ is obtained as a function of the volume fraction $\phi$ $(0
< \phi \leq 0.2)$ of the dispersed solid phase and the Weissenberg number $Wi$
$(0 \leq Wi \leq 4)$. From these predictions a closure law $\langle F

viscoelastic fluid model which is, on average, within $5.7\%$ of the DNS
results. Additionally, a flow solver able to couple Eulerian and Lagrangian
phases is developed, which incorporates the viscoelastic nature of the

We aim
to segment all sketches belonging to the same category provisioned with a

semantics embedded in the exemplar, and (ii) being robust to input style and
abstraction. We refer to this scenario as personalized. With that, we
importantly enable a much-desired personalization capability for downstream
fine-grained sketch analysis tasks. To train a robust segmentation module, we
deform the exemplar sketch to each of the available sketches of the same
category. Our method generalizes to sketches not observed during training. Our
central contribution is a sketch-specific hierarchical deformation network.
Given a multi-level sketch-strokes encoding obtained via a graph convolutional
network, our method estimates rigid-body transformation from the target to the
exemplar, on the upper level. Finer deformation from the exemplar to the
globally warped target sketch is further obtained through stroke-wise
deformations, on the lower level. Both levels of deformation are guided by mean
squared distances between the keypoints learned without supervision, ensuring
that the stroke semantics are preserved. We evaluate our method against the
state-of-the-art segmentation and perceptual grouping baselines re-purposed for
the one-shot setting and against two few-shot 3D shape segmentation methods. We
show that our method outperforms all the alternatives by more than $10\%$ on

thermalized in a nonlinear cylindrical multimode optical waveguide. We find,
that upon thermal equilibrium, the maximization of the optical entropy leads to
a generalized Rayleigh-Jeans distribution that governs the power modal
occupancies with respect to the discrete OAM charge numbers. This distribution
is characterized by a temperature that is by nature different from that
associated with the longitudinal electromagnetic momentum flow of the optical
field. Counterintuitively and in contrast to previous results, we demonstrate
that even under positive temperatures, the ground state of the fiber is not
always the most populated in terms of power. Instead, because of OAM, the
thermalization processes may favor higher order modes. A new equation of state
is derived along with an extended Euler equation -- resulting from the
extensivity of the entropy itself. By monitoring the nonlinear interaction
between two multimoded optical wavefronts with opposite spins, we show that the
exchange of angular momentum is dictated by the difference in OAM temperatures,
in full accord with the second law of thermodynamics. The theoretical analysis
presented here is corroborated by numerical simulations that take into account
the complex nonlinear dynamics of hundreds of modes. Our results may pave the
way towards high power optical sources with controllable orbital angular
momenta, and at a more fundamental level, could shed light on the physics of
other complex multimoded nonlinear bosonic systems that display additional
conservation laws.

classification tasks, often surpassing humans in terms of accuracy. However,
standard neural networks often fail to understand the concept of hierarchical
structures and dependencies among different classes for vision related tasks.
Humans on the other hand, seem to intuitively learn categories conceptually,
progressively growing from understanding high-level concepts down to granular
levels of categories. One of the issues arising from the inability of neural
networks to encode such dependencies within its learned structure is that of
subpopulation shift -- where models are queried with novel unseen classes taken
from a shifted population of the training set categories. Since the neural
network treats each class as independent from all others, it struggles to
categorize shifting populations that are dependent at higher levels of the
hierarchy. In this work, we study the aforementioned problems through the lens
of a novel conditional supervised training framework. We tackle subpopulation
shift by a structured learning procedure that incorporates hierarchical
information conditionally through labels. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of
graphical distance to model the catastrophic effect of mispredictions. We show
that learning in this structured hierarchical manner results in networks that
are more robust against subpopulation shifts, with an improvement up to 3\% in
terms of accuracy and up to 11\% in terms of graphical distance over standard
models on subpopulation shift benchmarks.

It was recently proposed to reduce simulation variance without incurring
additional computational costs by adopting fixed-amplitude initial conditions.
This method has been demonstrated not to introduce bias in various statistics,
including the two-point statistics of galaxy samples typically used for
extracting cosmological parameters from galaxy redshift survey data, but
requires us to revisit current methods for estimating covariance matrices of
clustering statistics for simulations. In this work, we find that it is not
trivial to construct covariance matrices analytically for fixed-amplitude
simulations, but we demonstrate that EZmock (Effective Zel'dovich approximation

with accurate two- and three-point statistics, provides reasonable covariance
matrix estimates for such simulations. We further examine how the variance
suppression obtained by amplitude-fixing depends on three-point clustering,
small-scale clustering, and galaxy bias, and propose intuitive explanations for
the effects we observe based on the EZmock bias model.

games to be applied to the solution of optimal control problems. To make the
argument, the vehicle employed is Pontryagin's canonical optimal control
example, which entails a double integrator plant. However, rather than
controlling the state to the origin, we require the end state to reach a
terminal set that contains the origin in its interior. Indeed, in practice, it
is required to control to a prescribed tolerance rather than reach a desired
end state; constraining the end state to a terminal manifold of co-dimension
n-1 renders the optimal control problem easier to solve. The global solution of
the optimal control problem is obtained and the synthesized optimal control law
is in state feedback form. In this respect, two target sets are considered: a
smooth circular target and a square target with corners. Closed-loop
state-feedback control laws are synthesized that drive the double integrator
plant from an arbitrary initial state to the target set in minimum time. This
is accomplished using Isaacs' method for the solution of differential games,
which entails Dynamic Programming (DP), working backward from the Usable Part
(UP) of the target set, as opposed to obtaining the optimal trajectories using
the necessary conditions for optimality provided by Pontryagin's Maximum
Principle (PMP). In this paper, the case is made for Isaacs' method for the
solution of differential games to be applied to the solution of optimal control
problems by way of the juxtaposition of the PMP and DP methods.

connundra. These include: the unexpected presence of ~10 ppm O2 in the cloud
layers; an unknown composition of large particles in the lower cloud layers;
and hard to explain measured vertical abundance profiles of SO2 and H2O. We
propose a new hypothesis for the chemistry in the clouds that largely addresses
all of the above anomalies. We include ammonia (NH3), a key component that has
been tentatively detected both by the Venera 8 and Pioneer Venus probes. NH3
dissolves in some of the sulfuric acid cloud droplets, effectively neutralizing
the acid and trapping dissolved SO2 as ammonium sulfite salts. This trapping of
SO2 in the clouds together with the release of SO2 below the clouds as the
droplets settle out to higher temperatures, explains the vertical SO2 abundance
anomaly. A consequence of the presence of NH3 is that some Venus cloud droplets
must be semi-solid ammonium salt slurries, with a pH~1, which matches Earth
acidophile environments, rather than concentrated sulfuric acid. The source of
NH3 is unknown, but could involve biological production; if so, then the most
energy-efficient NH3-producing reaction also creates O2, explaining the
detection of O2 in the cloud layers. Our model therefore predicts that the
clouds are more habitable than previously thought, and may be inhabited. Unlike
prior atmospheric models, ours does not require forced chemical constraints to
match the data. Our hypothesis, guided by existing observations, can be tested
by new Venus in situ measurements.

confirm that IPs are typically sloppy, i.e., insensitive to coordinated changes

ill-conditioned, parameters are unidentifiable. This presents challenges for
traditional statistical methods, as we demonstrate and interpret within both
Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We use information geometry to illuminate
the underlying cause of this phenomenon and show that IPs have global
properties similar to those of sloppy models from fields such as systems
biology, power systems, and critical phenomena. IPs correspond to bounded

mini-batch sampling procedure introduces a stochastic dynamics to the gradient
descent, with a non-trivial state-dependent noise. We characterize the
stochasticity of SGD and a recently-introduced variant, \emph{persistent} SGD,
in a prototypical neural network model. In the under-parametrized regime, where
the final training error is positive, the SGD dynamics reaches a stationary
state and we define an effective temperature from the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, computed from dynamical mean-field theory. We use the effective
temperature to quantify the magnitude of the SGD noise as a function of the
problem parameters. In the over-parametrized regime, where the training error
vanishes, we measure the noise magnitude of SGD by computing the average
distance between two replicas of the system with the same initialization and
two different realizations of SGD noise. We find that the two noise measures
behave similarly as a function of the problem parameters. Moreover, we observe
that noisier algorithms lead to wider decision boundaries of the corresponding

  Decomposition",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The CP tensor decomposition is used in applications such as machine learning
and signal processing to discover latent low-rank structure in multidimensional
data. Computing a CP decomposition via an alternating least squares (ALS)
method reduces the problem to several linear least squares problems. The
standard way to solve these linear least squares subproblems is to use the
normal equations, which inherit special tensor structure that can be exploited
for computational efficiency. However, the normal equations are sensitive to
numerical ill-conditioning, which can compromise the results of the
decomposition. In this paper, we develop versions of the CP-ALS algorithm using
the QR decomposition and the singular value decomposition (SVD), which are more
numerically stable than the normal equations, to solve the linear least squares
problems. Our algorithms utilize the tensor structure of the CP-ALS subproblems
efficiently, have the same complexity as the standard CP-ALS algorithm when the
rank is small, and are shown via examples to produce more stable results when
ill-conditioning is present. Our MATLAB implementation achieves the same
running time as the standard algorithm for small ranks, and we show that the
new methods can obtain lower approximation error and more reliably recover
low-rank signals from data with known ground truth.

powerful artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are trained individually on
behalf of self-interested principals but deployed in a shared environment.
Short of direct centralized regulation of AI, which is as difficult an issue as
regulation of human actions, one must design institutional mechanisms that
indirectly guide agents' behaviors to safeguard and improve social welfare in
the shared environment. Our paper focuses on one important class of such
mechanisms: the problem of adaptive incentive design, whereby a central planner
intervenes on the payoffs of an agent population via incentives in order to
optimize a system objective. To tackle this problem in high-dimensional
environments whose dynamics may be unknown or too complex to model, we propose
a model-free meta-gradient method to learn an adaptive incentive function in
the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Via the principle of online
cross-validation, the incentive designer explicitly accounts for its impact on
agents' learning and, through them, the impact on future social welfare.
Experiments on didactic benchmark problems show that the proposed method can
induce selfish agents to learn near-optimal cooperative behavior and
significantly outperform learning-oblivious baselines. When applied to a
complex simulated economy, the proposed method finds tax policies that achieve
better trade-off between economic productivity and equality than baselines, a
result that we interpret via a detailed behavioral analysis.

a turbulent environment using information provided by odor detections. To
exemplify its capabilities, the source-tracking task was framed as a partially
observable Markov decision process consisting in finding, as fast as possible,
a stationary target hidden in a 2D grid using stochastic partial observations
of the target location. Here we provide an extended review of infotaxis,
together with a toolkit for devising better strategies. We first characterize
the performance of infotaxis in domains from 1D to 4D. Our results show that,
while being suboptimal, infotaxis is reliable (the probability of not reaching
the source approaches zero), efficient (the mean search time scales as expected
for the optimal strategy), and safe (the tail of the distribution of search
times decays faster than any power law, though subexponentially). We then
present three possible ways of beating infotaxis, all inspired by methods used
in artificial intelligence: tree search, heuristic approximation of the value
function, and deep reinforcement learning. The latter is able to find, without
any prior human knowledge, the (near) optimal strategy. Altogether, our results
provide evidence that the margin of improvement of infotaxis toward the optimal
strategy gets smaller as the dimensionality increases.

provide an efficient approach to calculate diffusive jump rates according to
the transition state theory (TST). The use of standard harmonic TST is
impractical in bcc IIIB/IVB metals due to the existence of ill-defined harmonic
phonons, and most studies use classical or ab initio molecular dynamics for
direct simulation of diffusive jumps. Here, instead, we use a
stochastically-sampled temperature-dependent phonon analysis within the
transition state theory to study diffusive jumps without the need of direct
molecular dynamics simulations. We validate our first-principles diffusion

each variable is a linear combination of its direct causes and independent

set of second and third order moments of all random vectors that lie in the
corresponding model. Our focus is on finding the algebraic relations among
these moments for a given graph. We show that when the graph is a polytree
these relations form a toric ideal. We construct explicit trek-matrices
associated to 2-treks and 3-treks in the graph. Their entries are covariances
and third order moments and their 2-minors define our model set-theoretically.
Furthermore, we prove that their 2-minors also generate the vanishing ideal of
the model. Finally, we describe the polytopes of third order moments and the
ideals for models with hidden variables.

relevance into decision making. Based on the posterior probability that the
treatment effect reaches the lower reference value (statistical significance)
and the clinically meaningful value (clinical significance), BOP2-DC allows for
go/consider/no-go decisions, rather than a binary go/no-go decision, and it is
optimized to maximize the probability of a go decision when the treatment is
effective or minimize the sample size when the treatment is futile. BOP2-DC is
highly flexible and accommodates various types of endpoints, including binary,
continuous, time-to-event, multiple, and co-primary endpoints, in single-arm

desirable operating characteristics. The software to implement BOP2-DC is

equation and the Hori representation have been used to derive an exact
functional RG equation (EFRGE) that in the course of the RG flow interpolates
between the interaction part of the lattice Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian and the
logarithm of the generating functional of the S-matrix. Because the S-matrix
vertices are the amputated correlation functions of the fluctuating field, it
has been suggested that in the critical region the amputation of the long-range
tails makes the S-matrix functional more localized and thus more amenable to
the local potential approximation (LPA) than the renormalized free energy
functional used in Wilson's EFRGE. By means of a functional Legendre transform
the S-matrix EFRGE has been converted into an EFRGE for the effective action
(EA). It has been found that the field-dependent part of EA predicted by the
equation is the same as calculated within the known EA EFRGE approaches but in
addition it is accurately accounts for the field-independent terms. These are
indispensable in calculation of such important quantities as the the specific
heat, the latent heat, etc. With the use of the derived EFRGE a closed
expression for the renormalization counterterm has been obtained which when
subtracted from the divergent solution of the Wetterich equation would lead to
a finite exact expression for the EA thus making two approaches formally
equivalent. The S-matrix equation has been found to be simply connected with a
generalized functional Burgers' equation which establishes a direct
correspondence between the first order phase transitions and the shock wave
solutions of the RG equation. The transparent semi-group structure of the
S-matrix RG equation makes possible the use of different RG techniques at
different stages of the RG flow in order to improve the LPA solution.

river hydraulics analysis. These physics-based models are usually expensive and
slow to run, thus not suitable for real-time prediction or parameter inversion.
An attractive alternative is surrogate model. This work introduces an
efficient, accurate, and flexible surrogate model, NN-p2p, based on deep
learning and it can make point-to-point predictions on unstructured or
irregular meshes. The new method was evaluated and compared against existing
methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can only make
image-to-image predictions on structured or regular meshes. In NN-p2p, the
input includes both spatial coordinates and boundary features that can describe
the geometry of hydraulic structures, such as bridge piers. All surrogate
models perform well in predicting flow around different types of piers in the
training domain. However, only NN-p2p works well when spatial extrapolation is
performed. The limitations of CNN-based methods are rooted in their
raster-image nature which cannot capture boundary geometry and flow features
exactly, which are of paramount importance to fluid dynamics. NN-p2p also has
good performance in predicting flow around piers unseen by the neural network.
The NN-p2p model also respects conservation laws more strictly. The application
of the proposed surrogate model was demonstrated by calculating the drag
coefficient $C_D$ for piers and a new linear relationship between $C_D$ and the
logarithmic transformation of pier's length/width ratio was discovered.

sequential Bayesian games constitute a natural class of games for generalizing
these results. In particular, this model allows for an elegant formulation of
the counterfactual regret minimization algorithm, called public-state CFR
(PS-CFR), which naturally lends itself to an efficient implementation.
Empirically, solving a poker subgame with 10^7 states by public-state CFR takes
3 minutes and 700 MB while a comparable version of vanilla CFR takes 5.5 hours
and 20 GB. Additionally, the public-state formulation of CFR opens up the
possibility for exploiting domain-specific assumptions, leading to a quadratic
reduction in asymptotic complexity (and a further empirical speedup) over
vanilla CFR in poker and other domains. Overall, this suggests that the ability
to represent poker as a sequential Bayesian game played a key role in the
success of CFR-based methods. Finally, we extend public-state CFR to general
extensive-form games, arguing that this extension enjoys some - but not all -
of the benefits of the version for sequential Bayesian games.

and lower semicontinuous dependence of solutions on initial conditions --
properties that are captured by outer and inner well-posedness, respectively --
lead to the existence of a solution to the hybrid optimal control problem and
upper/lower semicontinuity of the optimal cost. In particular, by exploiting
properties of finite horizon reachable sets for hybrid systems, we show that
the optimal cost varies upper semicontinuously when the hybrid system is
(nominally) outer well-posed, and lower semicontinuously when it is (nominally)
inner well-posed and an additional assumption requiring partial knowledge of
solutions. Consequently, when the system is both (nominally) inner and outer
well-posed and the aforementioned assumption holds, the optimal cost varies
continuously, and optimal solutions vary upper semicontinuously. We further
show that even in the absence of this solution-based assumption, the optimal
cost can be continuously approximated. The results are demonstrated in finite
horizon optimization problems with hybrid dynamics, both theoretically and

networks to successfully capture the local and global context of a program
graph and effectively understand code semantics and vulnerable patterns. To
study VELVET's effectiveness, we use an off-the-shelf synthetic dataset and a
recently published real-world dataset. In the static analysis setting, where
vulnerable functions are not detected in advance, VELVET achieves 4.5x better
performance than the baseline static analyzers on the real-world data. For the
isolated vulnerability localization task, where we assume the vulnerability of
a function is known while the specific vulnerable statement is unknown, we
compare VELVET with several neural networks that also attend to local and
global context of code. VELVET achieves 99.6% and 43.6% top-1 accuracy over
synthetic data and real-world data, respectively, outperforming the baseline
deep-learning models by 5.3-29.0%.

zero energy modes that are protected by different kinds of symmetries. The
observation of these excitations in the form of Majorana fermions is one of the
most intensive quests in condensed matter physics. Their study is not only
interesting in itself, but also because they have promising applications in the
area of quantum computation. In this work we are interested in another class of
one dimensional topological systems, namely topological insulators. These also
present symmetry protected end modes with robust properties and do not require
the low temperatures necessary for topological superconductivity. We consider
the simplest kind of topological insulators, namely chains of atoms with
hybridized $sp$ orbitals. We study the transport properties of these chains in
the trivial, non-trivial topological phases and at the quantum topological
transition. We use a simple device consisting of two semi-infinite hybridized
$sp$-chains connected to a quantum dot and obtain the thermoelectric properties
of this system as a function of temperature and distance to the topological
transition. We show that the electrical conductance and the Wiedemann-Franz
ratio of the device at the topological transition have universal values at very
low temperatures. The thermopower gives direct evidence of fractional charges
in these systems.

real-life problems, but its high computation cost prohibits those models from
being deployed to edge devices. Pruning, as a method to introduce zeros to
model weights, has shown to be an effective method to provide good trade-offs
between model accuracy and computation efficiency, and is a widely-used method
to generate compressed models. However, the granularity of pruning makes
important trade-offs. At the same sparsity level, a coarse-grained structured
sparse pattern is more efficient on conventional hardware but results in worse
accuracy, while a fine-grained unstructured sparse pattern can achieve better
accuracy but is inefficient on existing hardware.
  On the other hand, some modern processors are equipped with fast on-chip
scratchpad memories and gather/scatter engines that perform indirect load and
store operations on such memories. In this work, we propose a set of novel
sparse patterns, named gather-scatter (GS) patterns, to utilize the scratchpad
memories and gather/scatter engines to speed up neural network inferences.
Correspondingly, we present a compact sparse format. The proposed set of sparse
patterns, along with a novel pruning methodology, address the load imbalance
issue and result in models with quality close to unstructured sparse models and
computation efficiency close to structured sparse models. Our experiments show
that GS patterns consistently make better trade-offs between accuracy and
computation efficiency compared to conventional structured sparse patterns. GS
patterns can reduce the runtime of the DNN components by two to three times at
the same accuracy levels. This is confirmed on three different deep learning
tasks and popular models, namely, GNMT for machine translation, ResNet50 for
image recognition, and Japser for acoustic speech recognition.

of attention in many areas, such as agriculture-technology and biotechnology.
The plant size depends on the velocity of streaming and the driving force
originating in molecular motors. Therefore, it is interesting to study detailed
information on the velocity of streaming. Recently, experimentally observed
peaks in the velocity distribution have been simulated by a 2D Langevin
Navier-Stokes (LNS) equation for vortex and flow function. However, to simulate
actual 3D flows, we have to use the NS equation for velocity, which, in the
case of 2D flows, is not always equivalent to that for vorticity and stream
function. In this paper, we report that a 2D LNS equation for velocity and
pressure successfully simulates protoplasmic streaming by comparing the results
with the experimental data and those obtained by 2D LNS simulations for vortex
and flow function. Moreover, a dimensional analysis clarifies the dependence of
numerical results on the strength $D$ of Brownian random force and physical
parameters such as kinematic viscosity and cell size. We find from this
analysis how the peak position in normalized velocity distribution moves
depending on these parameters.

French-American mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot used computers to calculate
iterations of complex polynomials of second order and displayed intricate
images of fractal geometry. While studying fundamental properties of the
Mandelbrot set, little attention has been paid to study the relationship
between the degree of the generating polynomials and the shape of the main body
of the Mandelbrot set. This paper extends the work from generating polynomials
of second degree to polynomials of higher degrees using basic principles of
complex numbers and calculus and shows that the number of primary lobes in the
Mandelbrot set corresponding to a polynomial of nth degree is n-1 and as n
tends to infinity the shape of the primary lobe tends to a circle of unit
radius. It is also shown that the arguments of the points where secondary lobes
are attached to the primary lobes are given by the roots of unity. These
results provide an easy way to predict shapes of the main lobes of Mandelbrot
sets and the locations of the points where secondary lobes are attached to the
main lobe and may be helpful in understanding features of the Mandelbrot set.

problem in graph mining. Finding cliques of size k (k-cliques) is one example
of this NP-hard problem. Different algorithms for clique counting avoid
counting the same clique multiple times by pivoting or ordering the graph.
Ordering-based algorithms include an ordering step to direct the edges in the
input graph, and a counting step, which is dominated by building node or
edge-induced subgraphs. Of the ordering-based algorithms, kClist is the
state-of-the art algorithm designed to work on sparse real-world graphs.
Despite its leading overall performance, kClist's vertex-parallel
implementation does not scale well in practice on graphs with a few million
vertices.
  We present CITRON (Clique counting with Traffic Reducing Optimizations) to
improve the parallel scalability and thus overall performance of clique
counting. We accelerate the ordering phase by abandoning kClist's sequential
core ordering and using a parallelized degree ordering. We accelerate the
counting phase with our reorganized subgraph data structures that reduce memory
traffic to improve scaling bottlenecks. Our sorted, compact neighbor lists
improve locality and communication efficiency which results in near-linear
parallel scaling. CITRON significantly outperforms kClist while counting
moderately sized cliques, and thus increases the size of graph practical for
clique counting.

ELIXIR designed to be able to generate such patches. ELIXIR aggressively uses
method calls, on par with local variables, fields, or constants, to construct
more expressive repair-expressions, that go into synthesizing patches. The
ensuing enlargement of the repair space, on account of the wider use of method
calls, is effectively tackled by using a machine-learnt model to rank concrete
repairs. The machine-learnt model relies on four features derived from the
program context, i.e., the code surrounding the potential repair location, and
the bug report. We implement ELIXIR and evaluate it on two datasets, the
popular Defects4J dataset and a new dataset Bugs.jar created by us, and against
2 baseline versions of our technique, and 5 other techniques representing the
state of the art in program repair. Our evaluation shows that ELIXIR is able to
increase the number of correctly repaired bugs in Defects4J by 85% (from 14 to
26) and by 57% in Bugs.jar (from 14 to 22), while also significantly
out-performing other state-of-the-art repair techniques including ACS,

for the spacetime metric of a cosmic string and showed how local interaction
with the vortex gauge field affects the scalar field total cross-section. Then
we apply this formalism to a Dirac field and show the explicit formula for the
fermionic total cross-section. Finally, we study the scattering of bosonic and
fermionic fields in the spacetime of an abelian and a nonabelian gravitating
cosmic strings and show that the cross-sections have damped oscillations. In
order to understand the origin of this behavior, we used the aforementioned toy

architectural information search activity is seldom explored. To fill this gap,
we conducted an industrial survey completed by 103 participants to understand
how developers search for architectural information to solve their
architectural problems in development. Our main findings are: (1) searching for
architectural information to learn about the pros and cons of certain
architectural solutions (e.g., patterns, tactics) and to make an architecture
decision among multiple choices are the most frequent purposes or tasks; (2)
developers find difficulties mostly in getting relevant architectural
information for addressing quality concerns and making design decisions among
multiple choices when seeking architectural information; (3) taking too much
time to go through architectural information retrieved from various sources and
feeling overwhelmed due to the dispersion and abundance of architectural
information in various sources are the top two major challenges developers face
when searching for architectural information. Our findings (1) provide
researchers with future directions, such as the design and development of
approaches and tools for searching architectural information from multiple
sources, and (2) can be used to provide guidelines for practitioners to refer
to when seeking architectural information and providing architectural
information that could be considered useful.

layers with V or Mn, the parental materials of trivial ferromagnetic insulators
are ripe to be converted into topological systems. Specifically, our
first-principles calculations show that, due to the elegant interplay between
bandgap narrowing and spin-orbital coupling, CrI3 branches into
high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall insulators of CrVI6 and CrMnI6 with
different topological invariants, while CrBr3 branches into topological
half-metals of CrVBr6 and CrMnBr6. Those novel 2D magnets are also shown to be
easily exfoliated from their bulk counterparts. The present study is thus
geared to advance the field of 2D magnetic materials into the topologically

initially by inverse Fourier transforms of the wavenumber-domain operators, and
then are tuned in a convolutional neural network to improve accuracy using
synthetic snapshots. Spatial filters are flexible for decomposing P-and S-waves

Snapshots from synthetic data show that the network-tuned spatial filters can
decompose P- and S-waves with improved decomposition accuracy compared with

Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. However, theoretical understanding of
these methods remains insufficient. Even in the episodic (time-inhomogeneous)
tabular setting, the state-of-the-art theoretical result of policy-based method
in \citet{shani2020optimistic} is only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{S^2AH^4K})$ where $S$
is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the horizon, and
$K$ is the number of episodes, and there is a $\sqrt{SH}$ gap compared with the
information theoretic lower bound $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{SAH^3K})$. To bridge
such a gap, we propose a novel algorithm Reference-based Policy Optimization
with Stable at Any Time guarantee (\algnameacro), which features the property
""Stable at Any Time"". We prove that our algorithm achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{SAH^3K} + \sqrt{AH^4K})$ regret. When $S > H$, our algorithm
is minimax optimal when ignoring logarithmic factors. To our best knowledge,
RPO-SAT is the first computationally efficient, nearly minimax optimal
policy-based algorithm for tabular RL.

program comprehension in different aspects. This study aimed at designing a
software visualization approach that graphically displays how code annotations
are distributed and organized in a software system and developing a tool, as a
reference implementation of the approach, to generate views and interact with
users. We conducted an empirical evaluation through questionnaires and
interviews to evaluate our visualization approach considering four aspects:
effectiveness for program comprehension, perceived usefulness, perceived ease
of use, and suitability for the intended audience. The resulting data was used
to perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis. The tool identifies package
responsibilities providing visual information about their annotations at
different levels. Using the developed tool, the participants achieved a high
correctness rate in the program comprehension tasks and performed very well in
questions about the overview of the system under analysis. Finally,
participants perceived that the tool outperforms existing approaches for code
inspection when searching for information related to code annotations. The
results show that the visualization approach using the developed tool is
effective in program comprehension tasks related to code annotations, which can
also be used to identify responsibilities in the application packages.
Moreover, it was evaluated as suitable for newcomers to overview the usage of

MeV ($\pm150$ MeV) around the $\phi(K^*(892))$ mass.In addition to the P wave
resonances,two important S wave backgrounds in the selected invariant mass

helicity amplitudes to contribute,including three P waves, two single S
waves,and one double S wave. We calculated the branching ratio for each

modes, both direct CP asymmetries and true TPAs are expected to be zero due to
the vanishing weak phase difference. The direct CP asymmetries for the $B^+$
mode are predicted to be tiny,since the tree contributions are suppressed with
respect to the penguin ones. The true asymmetries have shown no significant
deviations from zero.In contrast,large fake asymmetries are observed in these

the predictions of the S wave induced TPAs for the first time,which is

ambient hot gas in the central region of a cool core cluster of galaxies,
following the study by Inoue (2014, PASJ, 66, 60). In the rest frame of the
BCG, the hot gas is supposed to flow toward the BCG in parallel from a
sufficiently large distance. Then, it is expected that only the gas flowing
with the impact parameter less than a critical value is trapped by the
gravitation field of the BCG because of the efficient radiative cooling,
getting a cooling flow, and that the remaining outer gas can get over the
potential well. In such a circumstance, we can draw the following picture: A
boundary layer between the out-flowing gas and the trapped gas arises around
the stagnation point at the back side of the BCG. Since the boundary
temperature is so low as to be X-ray dim, the boundary could be observed as the
cold front in X-rays. The trapped gas once stagnates on the inner side of the
boundary and starts in-falling toward the BCG. Since the wandering motion of
the BCG is likely to have a rotational component, the Coriolis force induces a
rotational motion in the in-falling flow from the stagnation place to the BCG,
forming a spiral structure around the BCG. The spiraling flow turns the BCG on
the up stream side of the main flow from the far outside, and arises another
boundary layer having contact discontinuity with the main hot gas flow. These
pictures well reproduce the observed features such as cool cores, cold fronts,
and spiral structures. It can also be resolved how the cooling flow is
suppressed from what the cooling flow hypothesis predicts, without any heating
mechanism.

real-world images inherently possess multiple semantic labels. However, it is
difficult to collect large-scale multi-label annotations due to the complexity
of both the input images and output label spaces. To reduce the annotation
cost, we propose a structured semantic transfer (SST) framework that enables
training multi-label recognition models with partial labels, i.e., merely some
labels are known while other labels are missing (also called unknown labels)
per image. The framework consists of two complementary transfer modules that
explore within-image and cross-image semantic correlations to transfer
knowledge of known labels to generate pseudo labels for unknown labels.
Specifically, an intra-image semantic transfer module learns image-specific
label co-occurrence matrix and maps the known labels to complement unknown
labels based on this matrix. Meanwhile, a cross-image transfer module learns
category-specific feature similarities and helps complement unknown labels with
high similarities. Finally, both known and generated labels are used to train
the multi-label recognition models. Extensive experiments on the Microsoft
COCO, Visual Genome and Pascal VOC datasets show that the proposed SST
framework obtains superior performance over current state-of-the-art
algorithms. Codes are available at https://github.com/HCPLab-SYSU/HCP-MLR-PL.

hybrid algorithm intending to find the ground state of a target Hamiltonian.
Theoretically, QAOA can obtain the approximate solution if the quantum circuit
is deep enough. Actually, the performance of QAOA decreases practically if the
quantum circuit is deep since near-term devices are not noise-free and the
errors caused by noise accumulate as the quantum circuit increases. In order to
reduce the depth of quantum circuits, we propose a new ansatz dubbed as
""Shortcuts to QAOA"" (S-QAOA), S-QAOA provides shortcuts to the ground state of
target Hamiltonian by including more two-body interactions and releasing the
parameter freedoms. To be specific, besides the existing ZZ interaction in the
QAOA ansatz, other two-body interactions are introduced in the S-QAOA ansatz
such that the approximate solutions could be obtained with smaller circuit
depth. Considering the MaxCut problem and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model,
numerically computation shows the YY interaction has the best performance. The
reason for this might arise from the counterdiabatic effect generated by YY
interaction. On top of this, we release the freedom of parameters of two-body
interactions, which a priori do not necessarily have to be fully identical, and
numerical results show that it is worth paying the extra cost of having more
parameter freedom since one has a greater improvement on success rate.

methods or are characterized by expensive-to-conduct tests or experiments, are
encumbered with limited budget or finite computational resources. Moreover,
practical scenarios in the industry, impose restrictions, based on logistics
and preference, on the manner in which the experiments can be conducted. For
example, material supply may enable only a handful of experiments in a
single-shot or in the case of computational models one may face significant
wait-time based on shared computational resources. In such scenarios, one
usually resorts to performing experiments in a manner that allows for
maximizing one's state-of-knowledge while satisfying the above mentioned
practical constraints. Sequential design of experiments (SDOE) is a popular
suite of methods, that has yielded promising results in recent years across
different engineering and practical problems. A common strategy, that leverages
Bayesian formalism is the Bayesian SDOE, which usually works best in the
one-step-ahead or myopic scenario of selecting a single experiment at each step
of a sequence of experiments. In this work, we aim to extend the SDOE strategy,
to query the experiment or computer code at a batch of inputs. To this end, we
leverage deep reinforcement learning (RL) based policy gradient methods, to
propose batches of queries that are selected taking into account entire budget
in hand. The algorithm retains the sequential nature, inherent in the SDOE,
while incorporating elements of reward based on task from the domain of deep
RL. A unique capability of the proposed methodology is its ability to be
applied to multiple tasks, for example optimization of a function, once its
trained. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on a
synthetic problem, and a challenging high-dimensional engineering problem.

large-capacity and energy-efficient HVAC system (up to 100 MW), district
cooling system (DCS) is emerging in modern cities and has huge potential to be
regulated as a flexible load. However, strategically controlling a DCS to
provide flexibility is challenging, because one DCS services multiple buildings
with complex thermal dynamics and uncertain cooling demands. Improper control
may lead to significant thermal discomfort and even deteriorate the power
system's operation security. To address the above issues, we propose a
model-free control strategy based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
without the requirement of accurate system model and uncertainty distribution.
To avoid damaging ""trial & error"" actions that may violate the system's
operation security during the training process, we further propose a safe layer
combined to the DRL to guarantee the satisfaction of critical constraints,
forming a safe-DRL scheme. Moreover, after providing operating reserve, DCS
increases power and tries to recover all the buildings' temperature back to set
values, which may probably cause an instantaneous peak-power rebound and bring
a secondary impact on power systems. Therefore, we design a self-adaption
reward function within the proposed safe-DRL scheme to constrain the peak-power
effectively. Numerical studies based on a realistic DCS demonstrate the

InfoMap to absorbing random walks. To do this, we use absorption-scaled graphs,
in which the edge weights are scaled according to absorption rates, along with
Markov time sweeping. One of our adaptations of InfoMap converges to the
standard version of InfoMap in the limit in which the node-absorption rates
approach $0$. The community structure that we obtain using our adaptations of
InfoMap can differ markedly from the community structure that one detects using
methods that do not take node-absorption rates into account. Additionally, we
demonstrate that the community structure that is induced by local dynamics can
have important implications for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics
on ring-lattice networks. For example, we find situations in which the outbreak
duration is maximized when a moderate number of nodes have large
node-absorption rates.

applications. A fundamental problem in system identification that remains
rather unaddressed in extant literature is to leverage commonalities amongst
related linear systems to estimate their transition matrices more accurately.
To address this problem, the current paper investigates methods for jointly
estimating the transition matrices of multiple systems. It is assumed that the
transition matrices are unknown linear functions of some unknown shared basis
matrices. We establish finite-time estimation error rates that fully reflect
the roles of trajectory lengths, dimension, and number of systems under
consideration. The presented results are fairly general and show the
significant gains that can be achieved by pooling data across systems in
comparison to learning each system individually. Further, they are shown to be
robust against model misspecifications. To obtain the results, we develop novel
techniques that are of interest for addressing similar joint-learning problems.
They include tightly bounding estimation errors in terms of the
eigen-structures of transition matrices, establishing sharp high probability
bounds for singular values of dependent random matrices, and capturing effects
of misspecified transition matrices as the systems evolve over time.

deep joint source-channel coding. Our model incorporates the nonlinear
transform as a strong prior to effectively extract the source semantic features
and provide side information for source-channel coding. Unlike existing
conventional deep joint source-channel coding methods, the proposed NTSCC
essentially learns both the source latent representation and an entropy model
as the prior on the latent representation. Accordingly, novel adaptive rate
transmission and hyperprior-aided codec refinement mechanisms are developed to
upgrade deep joint source-channel coding. The whole system design is formulated
as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the end-to-end
transmission rate-distortion performance under established perceptual quality
metrics. Across test image sources with various resolutions, we find that the
proposed NTSCC transmission method generally outperforms both the analog
transmission using the standard deep joint source-channel coding and the
classical separation-based digital transmission. Notably, the proposed NTSCC
method can potentially support future semantic communications due to its

stochastic evolution of a dynamical system by a transition-rate matrix $Q$
which depends on a parameter $\theta$. Computing the probability distribution
over states at time $t$ requires the matrix exponential $\exp(tQ)$, and
inferring $\theta$ from data requires its derivative
$\partial\exp\!(tQ)/\partial\theta$. Both are challenging to compute when the
state space and hence the size of $Q$ is huge. This can happen when the state
space consists of all combinations of the values of several interacting
discrete variables. Often it is even impossible to store $Q$. However, when $Q$
can be written as a sum of tensor products, computing $\exp(tQ)$ becomes
feasible by the uniformization method, which does not require explicit storage
of $Q$.
  Results: Here we provide an analogous algorithm for computing
$\partial\exp\!(tQ)/\partial\theta$, the differentiated uniformization method.
We demonstrate our algorithm for the stochastic SIR model of epidemic spread,
for which we show that $Q$ can be written as a sum of tensor products. We
estimate monthly infection and recovery rates during the first wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic in Austria and quantify their uncertainty in a full Bayesian

genomes from the mixture of short fragments created by sequencing. Recent work
leverages the sparsity of the assembly graph to find $r$-dominating sets which
enable rapid approximate queries through a dominator-centric graph partition.
In this paper, we consider two problems related to reducing uncertainty and
improving scalability in this setting.
  First, we observe that nodes with multiple closest dominators necessitate
arbitrary tie-breaking in the existing pipeline. As such, we propose finding
$\textit{sparse}$ dominating sets which minimize this effect via a new
$\textit{congestion}$ parameter. We prove minimizing congestion is NP-hard, and
give an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\Delta^r})$ approximation algorithm, where $\Delta$
is the max degree.
  To improve scalability, the graph should be partitioned into uniformly sized
pieces, subject to placing vertices with a closest dominator. This leads to
$\textit{balanced neighborhood partitioning}$: given an $r$-dominating set,
find a partition into connected subgraphs with optimal uniformity so that each
vertex is co-assigned with some closest dominator. Using variance of piece
sizes to measure uniformity, we show this problem is NP-hard iff $r$ is greater
than $1$. We design and analyze several algorithms, including a polynomial-time
approach which is exact when $r=1$ (and heuristic otherwise).
  We complement our theoretical results with computational experiments on a
corpus of real-world networks showing sparse dominating sets lead to more
balanced neighborhood partitionings. Further, on the metagenome
$\textsf{HuSB1}$, our approach maintains high query containment and similarity
while reducing piece size variance.

honeypots have been historically used as decoy devices to help
researchers/organizations gain a better understanding of the dynamic of threats
on a network and their impact, IoT devices pose a unique challenge for this
purpose due to the variety of devices and their physical connections. In this
work, by observing real-world attackers' behavior in a low-interaction honeypot
ecosystem, we (1) presented a new approach to creating a multi-phased,
multi-faceted honeypot ecosystem, which gradually increases the sophistication
of honeypots' interactions with adversaries, (2) designed and developed a
low-interaction honeypot for cameras that allowed researchers to gain a deeper
understanding of what attackers are targeting, and (3) devised an innovative
data analytics method to identify the goals of adversaries. Our honeypots have
been active for over three years. We were able to collect increasingly
sophisticated attack data in each phase. Furthermore, our data analytics points
to the fact that the vast majority of attack activities captured in the
honeypots share significant similarity, and can be clustered and grouped to

Experiments on large-scale power systems demonstrate the accuracy and

model for real-world applications, providing a good tradeoff between accuracy,
computational efficiency, and implementation simplicity. In particular, the
LLOA method may have significant advantages compared to the traditional loss
factor formulation for multi-period, stochastic optimization problems where
good reference points may not be available. The paper also provides a

thus limiting their performance. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a
new perspective by enhancing segment-level representations with a simple yet
effective graph convolutional network, namely action complement graph network
(ACGNet). It facilitates the current video segment to perceive spatial-temporal
dependencies from others that potentially convey complementary clues,
implicitly mitigating the negative effects caused by the two issues above. By
this means, the segment-level features are more discriminative and robust to
spatial-temporal variations, contributing to higher localization accuracies.
More importantly, the proposed ACGNet works as a universal module that can be
flexibly plugged into different WTAL frameworks, while maintaining the
end-to-end training fashion. Extensive experiments are conducted on the
THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet1.2 benchmarks, where the state-of-the-art results

  Materials",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Determining causes of deaths (COD) occurred outside of civil registration and
vital statistics systems is challenging. A technique called verbal autopsy (VA)
is widely adopted to gather information on deaths in practice. A VA consists of
interviewing relatives of a deceased person about symptoms of the deceased in
the period leading to the death, often resulting in multivariate binary
responses. While statistical methods have been devised for estimating the
cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) for a study population, continued
expansion of VA to new populations (or ""domains"") necessitates approaches that
recognize between-domain differences while capitalizing on potential
similarities. In this paper, we propose such a domain-adaptive method that
integrates external between-domain similarity information encoded by a
pre-specified rooted weighted tree. Given a cause, we use latent class models
to characterize the conditional distributions of the responses that may vary by
domain. We specify a logistic stick-breaking Gaussian diffusion process prior
along the tree for class mixing weights with node-specific spike-and-slab
priors to pool information between the domains in a data-driven way. Posterior
inference is conducted via a scalable variational Bayes algorithm. Simulation
studies show that the domain adaptation enabled by the proposed method improves
CSMF estimation and individual COD assignment. We also illustrate and evaluate
the method using a validation data set. The paper concludes with a discussion
on limitations and future directions.

spiders using multiple silk threads are performed using the discrete elastic
rods method. The ballooning of spiders is hypothesised to be caused by the
presence of the negative electric charge of the spider silk threads and the
positive electric potential field in the earth's atmosphere. The numerical
model presented here is first validated against experimental data from the open
literature. After which, two cases are examined, in the first it is assumed
that the electric charge is uniformly distributed along the threads while in
the second, the electric charge is located at the thread tip. It is shown that
the normalized terminal ballooning velocity, i.e. the velocity at which the
spiders balloon after they reach steady-state, decrease linearly with the
normalized lift force, especially for the tip located charge case. For the
uniform electric charge case, this velocity shows a slightly weaker dependence
on the normalized lift force. Moreover, it is shown in both cases that the
normalized terminal ballooning velocity has no dependence on the normalized
elastic bending stiffness of the threads and on the normalized viscous forces.
Finally, the multi-thread bending process shows a three-dimensional conical
sheet. Here we show that this behavior is caused by the Coulomb repelling
forces owing to the threads electric charge which leads to dispersing the
threads apart and thus avoid entanglement.

important challenge of year 2020. Many mitigation policies have been imposed by
the governments at different regional levels (country, state, county, and city)
to stop the spread of this virus. Quantifying the effect of such mitigation
strategies on the transmission and recovery rates, and predicting the rate of
new daily cases are two crucial tasks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
modeling framework which not only accounts for such policies but also utilizes
the spatial and temporal information to characterize the pattern of COVID-19
progression. Specifically, a piecewise susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
model is developed while the dates at which the transmission/recover rates
change significantly are defined as ""break points"" in this model. A novel and
data-driven algorithm is designed to locate the break points using ideas from
fused lasso and thresholding. In order to enhance the forecasting power and to
describe additional temporal dependence among the daily number of cases, this
model is further coupled with spatial smoothing covariates and vector
auto-regressive (VAR) model. The proposed model is applied to several U.S.
states and counties, and the results confirm the effect of ""stay-at-home
orders"" and some states' early ""re-openings"" by detecting break points close to
such events. Further, the model provided satisfactory short-term forecasts of
the number of new daily cases at regional levels by utilizing the estimated
spatio-temporal covariance structures. They were also better or on par with

attention in the context of quantum gravity. This is because a BCFT can be dual
to gravity coupled to a heat bath CFT, known as the island model. On this
background, it would be interesting to explore the duality between the boundary
and the braneworld. However, this seems to be a challenging problem. The reason
is because although there has been much study of rational BCFTs, there has been
comparatively little study of irrational BCFTs, and irrational BCFTs are
expected to be the boundary duals of the braneworlds. For this reason, we
explore properties of boundary ingredients: the boundary primary spectrum, the
boundary-boundary-boundary OPE coefficients and the bulk-boundary OPE
coefficients. For this purpose, the conformal bootstrap is extremely useful.
This is the first step in providing an understanding of BCFTs in the context of
braneworld holography by using the conformal bootstrap. The techniques
developed in this paper may be useful for further investigation of irrational
BCFTs.

deep unfolding models with learnable thresholds in some shrinkage functions for
sparse coding. Drawing on some theoretical insights, we advocate an error-based
thresholding (EBT) mechanism for LISTA, which leverages a function of the
layer-wise reconstruction error to suggest an appropriate threshold value for
each observation on each layer. We show that the EBT mechanism well
disentangles the learnable parameters in the shrinkage functions from the
reconstruction errors, making them more adaptive to the various observations.
With rigorous theoretical analyses, we show that the proposed EBT can lead to a
faster convergence on the basis of LISTA and its variants, in addition to its
higher adaptivity. Extensive experimental results confirm our theoretical
analyses and verify the effectiveness of our methods.

over the time. During analysis of such events, ignoring the related unobserved
covariates or heterogeneity involved in data sample may leads us to adverse
consequences. In this context, frailty models are the viable choice to
investigate the effect of the unobserved covariates. In this article, we assume
that frailty acts multiplicatively to hazard rate. We propose inverse Gaussian
(IG) and generalized Lindley (GL) shared frailty models with generalized
Weibull (GW) as baseline distribution in order to analyze the unobserved
heterogeneity. To estimate the parameters in models, Bayesian paradigm of
Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique has been proposed. Model selection criteria
have been used for the comparison of models. Three different cancer data sets
have been analyzed using the shared frailty models. Better models have been
suggested for the data sets.

  populations using a discrete modelling framework","40 pages, 11 figures, 1 supplementary material document",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding whether a population will survive and flourish or become
extinct is a central question in population biology. One way of exploring this
question is to study population dynamics using reaction-diffusion equations,
where migration is usually represented as a linear diffusion term, and
birth-death is represented with a bistable source term. While linear diffusion
is most commonly employed to study migration, there are several limitations of
this approach, such as the inability of linear diffusion-based models to
predict a well-defined population front. One way to overcome this is to
generalise the constant diffusivity, $D$, to a nonlinear diffusivity function
$D(C)$, where $C>0$ is the density. While it has been formally established that
the choice of $D(C)$ affects long-term survival or extinction of a bistable
population, working solely in a classical continuum framework makes it
difficult to understand precisely how the choice of $D(C)$ affects survival or
extinction. Here, we address this question by working with a simple discrete
simulation model that is easy to interpret. The continuum limit of the discrete
model is a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation, where the flux involves a
nonlinear diffusion term and the source term is given by the strong Allee
effect bistable model. We study population extinction/survival using this very
intuitive discrete framework together with numerical solutions of the
reaction-diffusion continuum limit equation. This approach provides clear
insight into how the choice of $D(C)$ either encourages or suppresses
population extinction relative to the classical linear diffusion model.

are possible sources of detectable continuous gravitational waves. This paper
presents a fully-coherent search for such signals from eighteen pulsars in data
from LIGO and Virgo's third observing run (O3). For known pulsars, efficient
and sensitive matched-filter searches can be carried out if one assumes the
gravitational radiation is phase-locked to the electromagnetic emission. In the
search presented here, we relax this assumption and allow the frequency and
frequency time-derivative of the gravitational waves to vary in a small range
around those inferred from electromagnetic observations. We find no evidence
for continuous gravitational waves, and set upper limits on the strain
amplitude for each target. These limits are more constraining for seven of the
targets than the spin-down limit defined by ascribing all rotational energy
loss to gravitational radiation. In an additional search we look in O3 data for
long-duration (hours-months) transient gravitational waves in the aftermath of
pulsar glitches for six targets with a total of nine glitches. We report two
marginal outliers from this search, but find no clear evidence for such
emission either. The resulting duration-dependent strain upper limits do not
surpass indirect energy constraints for any of these targets.

  Agreement","AAAI 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  End-to-end speech-to-text translation (E2E-ST) is becoming increasingly
popular due to the potential of its less error propagation, lower latency, and
fewer parameters. Given the triplet training corpus $\langle speech,
transcription, translation\rangle$, the conventional high-quality E2E-ST system
leverages the $\langle speech, transcription\rangle$ pair to pre-train the
model and then utilizes the $\langle speech, translation\rangle$ pair to
optimize it further. However, this process only involves two-tuple data at each
stage, and this loose coupling fails to fully exploit the association between
triplet data. In this paper, we attempt to model the joint probability of
transcription and translation based on the speech input to directly leverage
such triplet data. Based on that, we propose a novel regularization method for
model training to improve the agreement of dual-path decomposition within
triplet data, which should be equal in theory. To achieve this goal, we
introduce two Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization terms into the model
training objective to reduce the mismatch between output probabilities of
dual-path. Then the well-trained model can be naturally transformed as the
E2E-ST models by the pre-defined early stop tag. Experiments on the MuST-C
benchmark demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art E2E-ST baselines on all 8 language pairs, while achieving
better performance in the automatic speech recognition task. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/duyichao/E2E-ST-TDA.

challenging task due to the existence of individual actions and human-object
interactions in elderly activities. Thus, we attempt to effectively aggregate
the discriminative information of actions and interactions from both RGB videos
and skeleton sequences by attentively fusing multi-modal features. Recently,
some nonlinear multi-modal fusion approaches are proposed by utilizing
nonlinear attention mechanism that is extended from Squeeze-and-Excitation
Networks (SENet). Inspired by this, we propose a novel
Expansion-Squeeze-Excitation Fusion Network (ESE-FN) to effectively address the
problem of elderly activity recognition, which learns modal and channel-wise
Expansion-Squeeze-Excitation (ESE) attentions for attentively fusing the
multi-modal features in the modal and channel-wise ways. Furthermore, we design
a new Multi-modal Loss (ML) to keep the consistency between the single-modal
features and the fused multi-modal features by adding the penalty of difference
between the minimum prediction losses on single modalities and the prediction
loss on the fused modality. Finally, we conduct experiments on a largest-scale
elderly activity dataset, i.e., ETRI-Activity3D (including 110,000+ videos, and
50+ categories), to demonstrate that the proposed ESE-FN achieves the best
accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, more
extensive experimental results show that the proposed ESE-FN is also comparable
to the other methods in terms of normal action recognition task.

(AD) is unusual in that causal events are not necessarily ordered by their
temporal order. However, their causal order can still be established if the
direction of information flow (DIF) is known. In order to obtain DIF between
trajectories of the two fish, we have made use of the difference of the
transfer entropy between the trajectories with a history length established by
experiments with known DIF. Our experimental results indicate that AD can be
observed much more often in fish pairs of different genders. The use of DIF to
determine causal order is further verified by the simulation of two chaotic
Lorenz oscillators with anticipatory coupling; mimicking the interaction
between the fish. Our simulation results further suggest that the two fish are
interacting with their own internal dynamics, not by adaptation.

high-dimensional predictors of survival outcomes. Post-selection inference for
right-censored outcome data has been investigated in the literature, but much
remains to be done to make the methods both reliable and
computationally-scalable in high-dimensions. Machine learning tools are
commonly used to provide {\it predictions} of survival outcomes, but the
estimated effect of a selected predictor suffers from confirmation bias unless
the selection is taken into account. The new approach involves construction of
semi-parametrically efficient estimators of the linear association between the
predictors and the survival outcome, which are used to build a test statistic
for detecting the presence of an association between any of the predictors and
the outcome. Further, a stabilization technique reminiscent of bagging allows a
normal calibration for the resulting test statistic, which enables the
construction of confidence intervals for the maximal association between
predictors and the outcome and also greatly reduces computational cost.
Theoretical results show that this testing procedure is valid even when the
number of predictors grows superpolynomially with sample size, and our
simulations support that this asymptotic guarantee is indicative the
performance of the test at moderate sample sizes. The new approach is applied
to the problem of identifying patterns in viral gene expression associated with
the potency of an antiviral drug.

disks at multiple wavelengths, allowing the study of the polarization spectrum.
Most disks show clear evidence of dust scattering through their unidirectional
polarization pattern typically at the shorter wavelength of $\sim 870 \mu$m.
However, certain disks show an elliptical pattern at $\sim 3$mm, which is
likely due to aligned grains. With HL Tau, its polarization pattern at $\sim
1.3$mm shows a transition between the two patterns making it the first example
to reveal such transition. We use the T-matrix method to model elongated dust
grains and properly treat scattering of aligned non-spherical grains with a
plane-parallel slab model. We demonstrate that a change in optical depth can
naturally explain the polarization transition of HL Tau. At low optical depths,
the thermal polarization dominates, while at high optical depths, dichroic
extinction effectively takes out the thermal polarization and scattering
polarization dominates. Motivated by results from the plane-parallel slab, we
develop a simple technique to disentangle thermal polarization of the aligned
grains $T_{0}$ and polarization due to scattering $S$ using the azimuthal
variation of the polarization fraction. We find that, with increasing
wavelength, the fractional polarization spectrum of the scattering component
$S$ decreases, while the thermal component $T_{0}$ increases, which is expected
since the optical depth decreases. We find several other sources similar to HL
Tau that can be explained by azimuthally aligned scattering prolate grains when
including optical depth effects. In addition, we explore how spirally aligned
grains with scattering can appear in polarization images.

virtual histology to clinical chest imaging, and typically require the
introduction of optics such as gratings. Here, we consider extracting x-ray
phase and dark-field signals from bright-field images collected using nothing
more than a coherent x-ray source and detector. Our approach is based on the
Fokker--Planck equation for paraxial imaging, which is the diffusive
generalization of the transport-of-intensity equation. Specifically, we utilize
the Fokker--Planck equation in the context of propagation-based phase-contrast
imaging, where we show that two intensity images are sufficient for successful
retrieval of the projected thickness and dark-field signals associated with the
sample. We show the results of our algorithm using both a simulated dataset and
an experimental dataset. These demonstrate that the x-ray dark-field signal can
be extracted from propagation-based images, and that x-ray phase can be
retrieved with better spatial resolution when dark-field effects are taken into
account. We anticipate the proposed algorithm will be of benefit in biomedical
imaging, industrial settings, and other non-invasive imaging applications.

appropriate sense induced by some natural metric, the bounded, continuous

application of our work, we see, in particular, that action functionals of a
wide class of metric spectral triples are continuous for the spectral
propinquity, which clearly connects convergence for the spectral propinquity
with the applications of noncommutative geometry to mathematical physics. This
fact is a consequence of results on the continuity of the multiplicity of
eigenvalues of Dirac operators. In particular, we formalize convergence of

model at half-filling on a triangular lattice. The electric field is
incorporated through the phase of the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude via
the Peierls prescription. When the on-site interaction $U$ is much larger than
the hopping, the effective Hamiltonian $H_{eff}$ describing the spin sector can
be found using a Floquet perturbation theory. To third order in the hopping,
$H_{eff}$ is found to have the form of a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with three
different nearest-neighbor couplings $(J_\alpha,J_\beta,J_\gamma)$ on bonds
lying along the different directions. Remarkably, when the periodic driving
does not have time-reversal symmetry (TRS), $H_{eff}$ is also found to have a
chiral three-spin interaction in each triangle, with the coefficient $C$ of the
interaction having opposite signs on up- and down-pointing triangles. Thus
periodic driving which breaks TRS can simulate the effect of a perpendicular
magnetic flux which is known to generate such a chiral term in the spin sector,
even though our model does not have a magnetic flux. The four parameters
$(J_\alpha,J_\beta,J_\gamma,C)$ depend on the amplitude, frequency and
direction of the oscillating electric field. We then study the spin model as a
function of these parameters using exact diagonalization and find a rich phase
diagram of the ground state with seven different phases consisting of two kinds
of ordered phases (colinear and coplanar) and disordered phases. Thus periodic
driving of the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice can lead to an effective
spin model whose couplings can be tuned over a range of values thereby
producing a variety of interesting phases.

transfer problems in porous media. GFDM is a meshless method that can obtain
the difference schemes of spatial derivatives by using Taylor expansion in
local node influence domains and the weighted least squares method. The
first-order single-point upstream scheme in the FDM/FVM-based reservoir
simulator is introduced to GFDM to form the upwind GFDM, based on which, a
sequential coupled discrete scheme of the pressure diffusion equation and the
heat convection-conduction equation is solved to obtain pressure and
temperature profiles. This paper demonstrates that this method can be used to
obtain the meshless solution of the convection-diffusion equation with a stable
upwind effect. For porous flow problems, the upwind GFDM is more practical and
stable than the method of manually adjusting the influence domain based on the
prior information of the flow field to achieve the upwind effect. Two types of
calculation errors are analyzed, and three numerical examples are implemented
to illustrate the good calculation accuracy and convergence of the upwind GFDM
for heat and mass transfer problems in porous media, and indicate the increase
of the radius of the node influence domain will increase the calculation error
of temperature profiles. Overall, the upwind GFDM discretizes the computational
domain using only a point cloud that is generated with much less topological
constraints than the generated mesh, but achieves good computational
performance as the mesh-based approaches, and therefore has great potential to
be developed as a general-purpose numerical simulator for various porous flow

vibrotactile feedback can be provided in mid-air. As a breakthrough to
compensate for this insufficiency, the application of pseudo-haptic features

can be explored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of four
pseudo-haptic features: proximity feedback, protrusion, hit effect, and
penetration blocking on user experience for free-hand mid-air button
interaction in VR. We conducted a user study on 21 young subjects to collect
user ratings on various aspects of user experience while users were freely
interacting with 16 buttons with different combinations of four features.
Results indicated that all investigated features significantly improved user
experience in terms of haptic illusion, embodiment, sense of reality,
spatiotemporal perception, satisfaction, and hedonic quality. In addition,
protrusion and hit effect were more beneficial in comparison with the other two
features. It is recommended to utilize the four proposed pseudo-haptic features

caution is needed when using proximity feedback together with other features.
The findings of this study could be helpful for VR developers and UI designers

convolutional patch embedding. Tokens of different scales are then
independently fed into the Transformer encoders via multiple paths and the
resulting features are aggregated, enabling both fine and coarse feature

generalization of the highly-studied problem of estimating the number of

vertices and $m$ hyperedges. A $k$-simplex in $H$ is a subhypergraph on $k+1$

The goal is to process a stream of hyperedges of $H$ and compute a good
estimate of $T_k(H)$, the number of $k$-simplices in $H$.
  We design a suite of algorithms for this problem. Under a promise that
$T_k(H) \ge T$, our algorithms use at most four passes and together imply a
space bound of $O( \epsilon^{-2} \log\delta^{-1} \text{polylog} n \cdot \min\{

$O(\epsilon^{-2} \log\delta^{-1} \log n\cdot (m/T) ( \Delta_E +
\Delta_V^{1-1/k} ))$ space, where $\Delta_E$ (respectively, $\Delta_V$) denotes
the maximum number of $k$-simplices that share a hyperedge (respectively, a

$\Omega(m\Delta_V^{1/k}/T)$ for multi-pass algorithms and $\Omega(m\Delta_E/T)$

networks (DNNs). Applied often along with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or
its variants, backpropagation is considered as a de-facto choice in a variety
of machine learning tasks including DNN training and adversarial
attack/defense. Recently, a linear variant of BP named LinBP was introduced for
generating more transferable adversarial examples for black-box adversarial
attacks, by Guo et al. Yet, it has not been theoretically studied and the
convergence analysis of such a method is lacking. This paper serves as a
complement and somewhat an extension to Guo et al.'s paper, by providing
theoretical analyses on LinBP in neural-network-involved learning tasks
including adversarial attack and model training. We demonstrate that, somewhat
surprisingly, LinBP can lead to faster convergence in these tasks in the same
hyper-parameter settings, compared to BP. We confirm our theoretical results

  Self-Labeling",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mining data streams poses a number of challenges, including the continuous
and non-stationary nature of data, the massive volume of information to be
processed and constraints put on the computational resources. While there is a
number of supervised solutions proposed for this problem in the literature,
most of them assume that access to the ground truth (in form of class labels)
is unlimited and such information can be instantly utilized when updating the
learning system. This is far from being realistic, as one must consider the
underlying cost of acquiring labels. Therefore, solutions that can reduce the
requirements for ground truth in streaming scenarios are required. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for mining drifting data streams on a
budget, by combining information coming from active learning and self-labeling.
We introduce several strategies that can take advantage of both intelligent
instance selection and semi-supervised procedures, while taking into account
the potential presence of concept drift. Such a hybrid approach allows for
efficient exploration and exploitation of streaming data structures within
realistic labeling budgets. Since our framework works as a wrapper, it may be
applied with different learning algorithms. Experimental study, carried out on
a diverse set of real-world data streams with various types of concept drift,
proves the usefulness of the proposed strategies when dealing with highly
limited access to class labels. The presented hybrid approach is especially
feasible when one cannot increase a budget for labeling or replace an
inefficient classifier. We deliver a set of recommendations regarding areas of
applicability for our strategies.

$\mathsf{SSUM}$, called $\mathsf{Subset~Product}$. Given positive integers
$a_1, ..., a_n$ and a target integer $t$, the $\mathsf{Subset~Product}$ problem
asks to determine whether there exists a subset $S \subseteq [n]$ such that
$\prod_{i \in S} a_i=t$. There is a pseudopolynomial time dynamic programming
algorithm, due to Bellman (1957) which solves the $\mathsf{SSUM}$ and
$\mathsf{Subset~Product}$ in $O(nt)$ time and $O(t)$ space.
  In the first part, we present {\em search} algorithms for variants of the
Subset Sum problem. Our algorithms are parameterized by $k$, which is a given
upper bound on the number of realisable sets (i.e.,~number of solutions,
summing exactly $t$). We show that $\mathsf{SSUM}$ with a unique solution is
already NP-hard, under randomized reduction. This makes the regime of
parametrized algorithms, in terms of $k$, very interesting.
  Subsequently, we present an $\tilde{O}(k\cdot (n+t))$ time deterministic
algorithm, which finds the hamming weight of all the realisable sets for a
subset sum instance. We also give a poly$(knt)$-time and $O(\log(knt))$-space
deterministic algorithm that finds all the realisable sets for a subset sum
instance.
  In the latter part, we present a simple and elegant randomized $\tilde{O}(n +
t)$ time algorithm for $\mathsf{Subset~Product}$. Moreover, we also present a
poly$(nt)$ time and $O(\log^2 (nt))$ space deterministic algorithm for the
same. We study these problems in the unbounded setting as well. Our algorithms
use multivariate FFT, power series and number-theoretic techniques, introduced

into recommender systems has attracted increasing attention in recent years.
However, unexpected behaviors in historical interactions like clicking some
items by accident don't well reflect users' inherent preferences. Existing
studies fail to model the effects of unexpected behaviors, thus achieve
inferior recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a
Multi-Preferences Model (MPM) to eliminate the effects of unexpected behaviors.
MPM first extracts the users' instant preferences from their recent historical
interactions by a fine-grained preference module. Then an unexpected-behaviors
detector is trained to judge whether these instant preferences are biased by
unexpected behaviors. We also integrate user's general preference in MPM.
Finally, an output module is performed to eliminate the effects of unexpected
behaviors and integrates all the information to make a final recommendation. We
conduct extensive experiments on two datasets of a movie and an e-retailing,
demonstrating significant improvements in our model over the state-of-the-art
methods. The experimental results show that MPM gets a massive improvement in
HR@10 and NDCG@10, which relatively increased by 3.643% and 4.107% compare with

to use more parameters than training samples. Quite surprisingly training the
neural network via (stochastic) gradient descent leads to models that
generalize very well, while classical statistics would suggest overfitting. In
order to gain understanding of this implicit bias phenomenon we study the
special case of sparse recovery (compressed sensing) which is of interest on
its own. More precisely, in order to reconstruct a vector from underdetermined
linear measurements, we introduce a corresponding overparameterized square loss
functional, where the vector to be reconstructed is deeply factorized into
several vectors. We show that, if there exists an exact solution, vanilla
gradient flow for the overparameterized loss functional converges to a good
approximation of the solution of minimal $\ell_1$-norm. The latter is
well-known to promote sparse solutions. As a by-product, our results
significantly improve the sample complexity for compressed sensing via gradient
flow/descent on overparameterized models derived in previous works. The theory
accurately predicts the recovery rate in numerical experiments. Our proof
relies on analyzing a certain Bregman divergence of the flow. This bypasses the
obstacles caused by non-convexity and should be of independent interest.

massless scalar fields on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds of infinite
lifetime. The construction is based on an analysis of families of solutions of
the Klein-Gordon equation with a varying mass parameter. It makes use of the
so-called bosonic mass oscillation property which states that integrating over
the mass parameter generates decay of the field at infinity. We derive a
canonical decomposition of the solution space of the Klein-Gordon equation into
two subspaces, independent of observers or the choice of coordinates. This
decomposition endows the solution space with a canonical complex structure. It
also gives rise to a distinguished quasi-free state. Taking a suitable limit
where the mass tends to zero, we obtain corresponding results for massless
fields. Our constructions and results are illustrated in the examples of
Minkowski space and ultrastatic spacetimes.

SOIT, that Segments Objects with Instance-aware Transformers. Inspired by DETR
\cite{carion2020end}, our method views instance segmentation as a direct set
prediction problem and effectively removes the need for many hand-crafted
components like RoI cropping, one-to-many label assignment, and non-maximum
suppression (NMS). In SOIT, multiple queries are learned to directly reason a
set of object embeddings of semantic category, bounding-box location, and
pixel-wise mask in parallel under the global image context. The class and
bounding-box can be easily embedded by a fixed-length vector. The pixel-wise
mask, especially, is embedded by a group of parameters to construct a
lightweight instance-aware transformer. Afterward, a full-resolution mask is
produced by the instance-aware transformer without involving any RoI-based
operation. Overall, SOIT introduces a simple single-stage instance segmentation
framework that is both RoI- and NMS-free. Experimental results on the MS COCO
dataset demonstrate that SOIT outperforms state-of-the-art instance
segmentation approaches significantly. Moreover, the joint learning of multiple
tasks in a unified query embedding can also substantially improve the detection
performance. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/yuxiaodongHRI/SOIT}.

power and temperature. Using a self-consistent calculation based on the
drift-diffusion and Poisson equations as well as on photocarrier statistics
(Van Roosbroeck model), it is found that this tail is due to photocarrier drift
in an internal electric field nearly two orders of magnitude larger than
electric fields predicted by the usual ambipolar model. This large electric
field appears because of two effects. Firstly, for transport in the spatial
fluctuations of the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum, the
electron mobility is activated by the internal electric field. This implies, in
a counter intuitive way, that the spatial fluctuations favor long distance
transport. Secondly, the range of carrier transport is further increased
because of the finite NW length, an effect which plays a key role in
one-dimensional systems.

recently introduced proof system for false QBFs. It stores the countermodels as
merge maps. Merge maps are deterministic branching programs in which
isomorphism checking is efficient making MRes a polynomial time verifiable
proof system.
  In this paper, we introduce a family of proof systems MRes-R in which, the
countermodels are stored in any pre-fixed complete representation R, instead of
merge maps. Hence corresponding to each such R, we have a sound and
refutationally complete QBF-proof system in MRes-R. To handle arbitrary
representations for the strategies, we introduce consistency checking rules in
MRes-R instead of isomorphism checking. As a result these proof systems are not
polynomial time verifiable. Consequently, the paper shows that using merge maps
is too restrictive and can be replaced with arbitrary representations leading
to several interesting proof systems.
  Exploring proof theoretic properties of MRes-R, we show that
eFrege+$\forall$red simulates all valid refutations from proof systems in
MRes-R. In order to simulate arbitrary representations in MRes-R, we first
represent the steps used by the proof systems as a new complete structure.
Consequently, the corresponding proof system belonging to MRes-R is able to
simulate all proof systems in MRes-R. Finally, we simulate this proof system
via eFrege+$\forall$red using the ideas from [Chew et al. ECCC.'2021].
  On the lower bound side, we show that the completion principle formulas from
[Jonata et al. Theor. Comput. Sci.'2015] which are shown to be hard for regular
MRes in [Beyersdorff et al. FSTTCS.'2020], are also hard for any regular proof
system in MRes-R. Thereby, the paper lifts the lower bound of regular MRes to
an entire class of proof systems, which use some complete representation,
including those undiscovered, instead of merge maps.

TOA-based source localization and apply online gradient descent (OGD) to it to
generate the position estimates of the target. To analyze the tracking
performance of OGD, we first revisit the classic least-squares formulation of
the (static) TOA-based source localization problem and elucidate its estimation
and geometric properties. In particular, under standard assumptions on the TOA
measurement model, we establish a bound on the distance between an optimal
solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position. Using
this bound, we show that the loss function in the formulation, albeit
non-convex in general, is locally strongly convex at its global minima. To the
best of our knowledge, these results are new and can be of independent
interest. By combining them with existing techniques from online strongly
convex optimization, we then establish the first non-trivial bound on the
cumulative target tracking error of OGD. Our numerical results corroborate the
theoretical findings and show that OGD can effectively track the target at
different noise levels.

this form factor arises when the isospin symmetry is broken, which is the case
if the $u$ and $d$ quark masses are split, as in the real world, or if the
electromagnetic effects were taken into account. We obtain estimates for this
basic property of the pion resulting from the quark mass splitting for a range
of model parameters, and importantly, for different pion masses, going up to
the values used in lattice QCD. We find very stable model results, with the
mean square radius of $\pi^+$ in the range $(0.05-0.07~{\rm fm})^2$. From
charge conjugation, the baryonic form factor of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ are equal

carries a negative, and the outside -- a positive baryon number density, both
cancelling to zero, as obviously the pion carries no net baryon charge. We also
carry out an analogous analysis for the kaon, where the effect is much larger

propagation speed monotonically increases with bubble volume so that two
bubbles of different sizes, in the absence of any hydrodynamic interactions
will either coalesce or separate in a finite time. However our experiments
indicate that the bubbles interact and that an unstable two-bubble state is
responsible for the eventual dynamical outcome: coalescence or separation.
These results motivate us to develop an edge-tracking routine and calculate
these weakly unstable two-bubble steady states from the governing equations.
The steady states consist of pairs of `aligned' bubbles that appear on the same
side of the centreline with the larger bubble leading. We also discover,
through time-simulations and physical experiment, another class of two-bubble
states which, surprisingly, consist of stable two-bubble steady states. In
contrast to the `aligned' steady states, these bubbles appear either side of
the centreline and are `offset' from each other. We calculate the bifurcation
structures of both classes of steady states as the flow-rate and bubble volume
ratio is varied. We find that they exhibit intriguing similarities to the
single-bubble bifurcation structure, which has implications for the existence
of $n$-bubble steady states.

processing a high-dimensional embedding vector that is difficult to train. In
this paper, we first utilize a directed acyclic graph neural network (DAGNN) to
process the input and propose a novel Pipelined-DAGNN, which can effectively
speed up the feature extraction process of the DAGNN. Next, we feed the
embedding sequence composed of schedulable coflows instead of a flat embedding
of all coflows to the policy network, and output a priority sequence, which
makes the size of the policy network depend on only the dimension of features
instead of the product of dimension and number of nodes in the job's
DAG.Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the priority scheduling policy, we
incorporate the Self-Attention Mechanism into a deep RL model to capture the
interaction between different parts of the embedding sequence to make the
output priority scores relevant. Based on this model, we then develop a coflow
scheduling algorithm for online multi-stage jobs.

the pair-instability gap, may be produced by hierarchical mergers in the disks
surrounding Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). While the interaction of an embedded
BBH with an AGN disk is typically assumed to facilitate a merger, recent
high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations challenge this assumption. However,
these simulations often have simplified treatments for the gas thermodynamics.
In this work, we model the possible consequence of various feedback from an
embedded BBH with a simple model that maintains an enhanced temperature profile
around each binary component. We show that when the minidisks around each BH
become hotter than the background by a factor of three, the BBH orbital
evolution switches from expansion to contraction. By analyzing the
gravitational torque profile, we find that this change in direction is driven
by a weakening of the minidisk spirals and their positive torque on the binary.
Our results highlight the important role of thermodynamics around BBHs and its
effect on their orbital evolution, suggesting that AGN disks could be efficient
factories for BBH mergers.

to significant performance improvements in a wide range of medical image
segmentation tasks. However, state-of-the-art networks for a given task may be
too computationally demanding to run on affordable hardware, and thus users
often resort to practical workarounds by modifying various macro-level design
aspects. Two common examples are downsampling of the input images and reducing
the network depth to meet computer memory constraints. In this paper we
investigate the effects of these changes on segmentation performance and show
that image complexity can be used as a guideline in choosing what is best for a
given dataset. We consider four statistical measures to quantify image
complexity and evaluate their suitability on ten different public datasets. For
the purpose of our experiments we also propose two new encoder-decoder
architectures representing shallow and deep networks that are more memory
efficient than currently popular networks. Our results suggest that median
frequency is the best complexity measure in deciding about an acceptable input
downsampling factor and network depth. For high-complexity datasets, a shallow
network running on the original images may yield better segmentation results
than a deep network running on downsampled images, whereas the opposite may be
the case for low-complexity images.

on an eye-movement experiment with four different task conditions, we estimated
model parameters for each individual observer and task condition using a fully

that model properties such as the attentional span are adjusted to task
requirements. Posterior predictive checks indicate that our dynamical model can

major fraction of irregular beam loss events observed in LHC physics operation.
The events cease after a few beam revolutions because of the expulsion of dust
particles from the beam once they become ionized in the transverse beam tails.
Despite the transient nature of these events, the resulting beam losses can
trigger beam aborts or provoke quenches of superconducting magnets. In this
paper, we study the characteristics of beam-dust particle interactions in the
cryogenic arcs by reconstructing key observables like nuclear collision rates,
loss durations and integral losses per event. The study is based on events
recorded during 6.5 TeV operation with stored beam intensities of up to $\sim
3\times 10{^{14}}$ protons per beam. We show that inelastic collision rates can
reach almost $10^{12}$ collisions per second, resulting in a loss of up to
$\sim 1.6\times 10^{8}$ protons per event. We demonstrate that the experimental
distributions and their dependence on beam parameters can be described
quantitatively by a previously developed simulation model if dust particles are
assumed to be attracted by the beam. The latter finding is consistent with
recent time profile studies and yields further evidence that dust particles
carry a negative charge when entering the beam. We also develop different
hypotheses regarding the absence of higher-loss events in the measurements,
although such events are theoretically not excluded by the simulation model.
The results provide grounds for predicting dust-induced beam losses in presence
of higher-intensity beams in future runs of the High-Luminosity LHC.

efficiency of 92$\%$, a near-field effective length of 376 $\mu m$ and a
far-field divergence angle of 0.105$^{\circ}$ at a wavelength of 850 nm. The
diffraction grating has a high tolerance to process variations based on Monte
Carlo Analysis. When the conditions are $\pm$5$\%$ layer thickness variation,
$\pm$50 nm lithographic variation and $\pm$20 nm wavelength drift, more than
71$\%$ of the grating samples have a diffraction efficiency higher than 80$\%$,
and 100$\%$ of the samples have an effective length larger than 200 $\mu m$
(corresponding to a far-field divergence <0.2$ ^{\circ}$). Furthermore, the
near-field effective length of the grating with an upward diffraction
efficiency above 90$\%$ can be adjusted from hundreds of microns to centimeters
by changing the etching layer thickness and the grating duty cycle. This
diffraction grating has potential application in optical sensing and imaging
from visible to near-infrared wavelengths.

Ln=rare-earth), which are promising materials for future spintronics
applications, is difficult to resolve experimentally due to a strong influence
of defects on their transport and optical properties. At the same time, LnN are
challenging for theory, since wide semiconducting/semimetallic 2p and 5d bands
need to be described simultaneously with strongly correlated 4f states. Here,
we calculate the many-body spectral functions and optical gaps of a series of
LnN (with Ln= Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) by a density-functional+dynamical
mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach treating the correlated Ln 4f shells
within the quasi-atomic Hubbard-I approximation. The on-site Coulomb
interaction in the 4f shell is evaluated by a constrained DFT+Hubbard-I
approach. Furthermore, to improve the treatment of semiconducting bands in
DFT+DMFT, we employ the modified Becke-Johnson semilocal exchange potential.
Focusing on the paramagnetic high-temperature phase, we find that all
investigated LnN are pd semiconductors with gap values ranging from 1.02 to
2.14 eV along the series. The pd band gap is direct for light Ln= La...Sm and
becomes indirect for heavy rare-earths. Despite a pronounced evolution of the
Ln 4f states along the series, empty 4f states are invariably found above the
bottom of the 5d conduction band. The calculated spectra agree well with those
available from x-ray photoemission, x-ray emission and x-ray absorption
measurements.

is sufficient to reconstruct $X$ by itself, but both together can recover $X$
fully, and the joint distribution of $(f(X),g(X))$ is tractable? As one
example, if $X=(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ and $P$ is a product distribution, then for any

$g(X)=(X_{m+1},\dots,X_n)$. Rasines and Young (2022) offers an alternative
route of accomplishing this task through randomization of $X$ with additive
Gaussian noise which enables post-selection inference in finite samples for
Gaussian distributed data and asymptotically for non-Gaussian additive models.
In this paper, we offer a more general methodology for achieving such a split

(frequentist) solution that can be viewed as a continuous analog of data
splitting. We call our method data fission, as an alternative to data
splitting, data carving and p-value masking. We exemplify the method on a few
prototypical applications, such as post-selection inference for trend filtering

anchored nanowires decorated with plasmonic metamolecules. The nonlinearity
resides in the mechanical properties of the nanowires and is transduced to its
optical response by reconfiguring the plasmonic metamolecules. Such a system
can be driven to a bistable response by acoustic signals modulated at the
natural mechanical resonance of the nanowire. The memory of such a device is
volatile and can be erased by removing the acoustic signal but in its presence,
it can be switched between bistable optical states with microwatts of optical

electrons generates a contribution to the electric resistivity of metals with a
distinct T$^2$ temperature dependence. The amplitude of this term is small in
common metals, but dominant in metals hosting either heavy carriers or a low
concentration of them. The link between the temperature dependence and the size
of the scattering phase space is straightforward, but not the microscopic
source of dissipation. To explain how electron-electron collisions lead to
momentum leak, Umklapp events or multiple electron reservoirs have been
invoked. This interpretation is challenged by a number of experimental
observations: the persistence of T-square resistivity in dilute metals (in
which the two mechanisms are irrelevant), the successful extension of
Kadowaki-Woods scaling to dilute metals, and the observation of a
size-dependent T-square thermal resistivity ($T/\kappa$) and its
Wiedemann-Franz (WF) correlation with T-square electrical resistivity. This
paper argues that much insight is provided by the case of normal liquid $^3$He

driven by fermion-fermion collisions. The amplitude of T-square resistivity in
$^3$He and in metals share a common scaling. Thus, the ubiquitous T-square

the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) is cut off outside the

Therefore the present constraints from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration
still hold. However for one of these models, if a fraction $\gtrsim O(10^{-3})$
of these particles cascades into $\gamma$-rays, and if the gravitational
backreaction scale follows the Polchinski-Rocha model, then the string tension
is tightly constrained from below by measurements of the Diffuse $\gamma$-Ray

around M-dwarf stars, yet the atmospheric dynamics of these planets is
relatively unexplored. In this paper, we aim to provide a basic underpinning of
the dry dynamics of general low mean molecular weight, temperate sub-Neptune
atmospheres. We use the ExoFMS GCM with an idealised grey gas radiation scheme
to simulate planetary atmospheres with different levels of instellation and
rotation rates, using the atmosphere of K2-18b as our control. We find that the
atmospheres of tidally-locked, temperate sub-Neptunes have weak horizontal
temperature gradients owing to their slow rotation rates and hydrogen-dominated
composition. The zonal wind structure is dominated by high-latitude
cyclostrophic jets driven by the conservation of angular momentum. At low
pressures we observe superrotating equatorial jets, which we propose are driven
by a Rossby-Kelvin instability similar to the type seen in simulations of
idealised atmospheres with axisymmetric forcing. By viewing the flow in
tidally-locked coordinates, we find the predominant overturning circulation to
be between the dayside and nightside, and we derive scaling relations linking
the tidally-locked streamfunction and vertical velocities to instellation.
Comparing our results to the only other GCM study of K2-18b, we find
significant qualitative differences in dynamics, highlighting the need for
further collaboration and investigation into effects of different dynamical
cores and physical parameterizations. This paper provides a baseline for
studying the dry dynamics of temperate sub-Neptunes, which will be built on in
part II with the introduction of moist effects.

traffic flows in cars, and thereby serve as network anomaly detectors. TSN is
the leading candidate for implementing quality of service in vehicular Ethernet
backbones. We classify the impact of network attacks on traffic flows and
benchmark the detection performance in each individual class. Based on a
backbone topology derived from a real car and its traffic definition, we
evaluate the detection system in realistic scenarios with real attack traces.
Our results show that the detection accuracy depends on the precision of the
in-vehicle communication specification, the traffic type, the corruption layer,

RL framework. SAC is demonstrated to perform very well in a list of continous
control tasks with good stability and robustness. SAC learns a stochastic
Gaussian policy that can maximize a trade-off between total expected reward and
the policy entropy. To update the policy, SAC minimizes the KL-Divergence
between the current policy density and the soft value function density.
Reparameterization trick is then used to obtain the approximate gradient of
this divergence. In this paper, we propose Soft Actor-Critic with Cross-Entropy
Policy Optimization (SAC-CEPO), which uses Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) to
optimize the policy network of SAC. The initial idea is to use CEM to
iteratively sample the closest distribution towards the soft value function
density and uses the resultant distribution as a target to update the policy
network. For the purpose of reducing the computational complexity, we also
introduce a decoupled policy structure that decouples the Gaussian policy into
one policy that learns the mean and one other policy that learns the deviation
such that only the mean policy is trained by CEM. We show that this decoupled
policy structure does converge to a optimal and we also demonstrate by

an open-source toolset for logging commands that students execute on Linux

it can be easily used in classes on different topics. 2) It collects metadata
about the command execution, such as a timestamp, hostname, and IP address. 3)
Data are instantly forwarded to central storage in a unified, semi-structured

enhance the instructors' understanding of student actions. The toolset works
independently of the teaching content, the training network's topology, or the
number of students working in parallel. We demonstrated the toolset's value in
two learning environments at four training sessions. Over two semesters, 50
students played educational cybersecurity games using a Linux command-line

TeV. The hidden sector is hypothesized to couple to the standard model (SM) via
a heavy leptophobic Z' mediator produced as a resonance in proton-proton
collisions. The mediator decay results in two ""semivisible"" jets, containing
both visible matter and invisible dark matter. The final state therefore
includes moderate missing energy aligned with one of the jets, a signature
ignored by most dark matter searches. No structure in the dijet transverse mass
spectra compatible with the signal is observed. Assuming the Z' has a universal
coupling of 0.25 to the SM quarks, an inclusive search, relevant to any model
that exhibits this kinematic behavior, excludes mediator masses of 1.5-4.0 TeV
at 95% confidence level, depending on the other signal model parameters. To
enhance the sensitivity of the search for this particular class of hidden
sector models, a boosted decision tree (BDT) is trained using jet substructure
variables to distinguish between semivisible jets and SM jets from background
processes. When the BDT is employed to identify each jet in the dijet system as
semivisible, the mediator mass exclusion increases to 5.1 TeV, for wider ranges
of the other signal model parameters. These limits exclude a wide range of
strongly coupled hidden sector models for the first time.

consequences of ignoring the colored noise spectrum and non-linearities

During the shape formation process, several checkpoints are inserted to

with the feedback-loop issue in large-scale online recommender systems. Most of
existing studies believe that high uncertainty can be a good indicator of
potential reward, and thus primarily focus on the estimation of model
uncertainty. We argue that such an approach overlooks the subsequent effect of
exploration on model training. From the perspective of online learning, the
adoption of an exploration strategy would also affect the collecting of
training data, which further influences model learning. To understand the
interaction between exploration and training, we design a Pseudo-Exploration
module that simulates the model updating process after a certain item is
explored and the corresponding feedback is received. We further show that such
a process is equivalent to adding an adversarial perturbation to the model
input, and thereby name our proposed approach as an the Adversarial Gradient
Driven Exploration (AGE). For production deployment, we propose a dynamic
gating unit to pre-determine the utility of an exploration. This enables us to
utilize the limited amount of resources for exploration, and avoid wasting
pageview resources on ineffective exploration. The effectiveness of AGE was
firstly examined through an extensive number of ablation studies on an academic
dataset. Meanwhile, AGE has also been deployed to one of the world-leading
display advertising platforms, and we observe significant improvements on
various top-line evaluation metrics.

main halos), hosting galaxies and eventually a population of less massive dark
matter over-densities, (i.e. sub-halos). The determination of the spatial dark
matter distribution in halos and sub-halos is one major challenge in the
analysis of galaxy formation simulations, and usually relies on halo finder
algorithms coupled with approximated analytical density profiles. Such
determination is crucial for deriving, among others, dark matter signatures in
astroparticle observables, e.g. the flux of gamma-ray photons from dark matter
particle annihilation. We present here the ""Halo Accurate Density Evaluation
System"" (HADES) a novel numerical tool to reconstruct the dark matter density
locally at any point in the simulation volume with high accuracy. We run
thorough tests of the code performances on dedicated mock realisations of halos
starting from analytical dark matter profile distributions. We show that on
mock halos HADES can recover the dark matter density with a few $\%$ accuracy,
resolving efficiently all sub-structures containing down to 1000 particles and
providing conservative estimates for smaller sub-halos. We illustrate how HADES
can be used to compute all-sky maps of the dark matter spatial distribution,
squared and integrated along the line of sight, already accounting for the
signal boosting coming from density fluctuations. We also present an
application of the code to one halo in the TNG50-1-Dark simulation from the
IllustrisTNG suite, and highlight how HADES automatically maps out the
asymmetries present in the dark matter spatial distribution both in halos and
sub-halos, promising to become a helpful tool for a vast number of
astrophysical applications.

solve the monaural speech enhancement problem. Due to the lack of using clean
phase information, the enhancement performance is limited in most SSL methods.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a phase-aware self-supervised learning
based monaural speech enhancement method. The latent representations of both
amplitude and phase are studied in two decoders of the foundation autoencoder
(FAE) with only a limited set of clean speech signals independently. Then, the
downstream autoencoder (DAE) learns a shared latent space between the clean
speech and mixture representations with a large number of unseen mixtures. A
complex-cycle-consistent (CCC) mechanism is proposed to minimize the
reconstruction loss between the amplitude and phase domains. Besides, it is
noticed that if the speech features are extracted as the multi-resolution
spectra, the desired information distributed in spectra of different scales can
be studied to further boost the performance. The NOISEX and DAPS corpora are
used to generate mixtures with different interferences to evaluate the efficacy
of the proposed method. It is highlighted that the clean speech and mixtures
fed in FAE and DAE are not paired. Both ablation and comparison experimental
results show that the proposed method clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches.

(PONet) that is able to robustly estimate 3D pose by learning orientations
only, hence bypassing the error-prone keypoint detector in the absence of image
evidence. For images with partially invisible limbs, PONet estimates the 3D
orientation of these limbs by taking advantage of the local image evidence to
recover the 3D pose.Moreover, PONet is competent to infer full 3D poses even
from images with completely invisible limbs, by exploiting the orientation
correlation between visible limbs to complement the estimated poses,further
improving the robustness of 3D pose estimation.We evaluate our method on
multiple datasets, including Human3.6M, MPII, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. Our
method achieves results on par with state-of-the-art techniques in ideal
settings, yet significantly eliminates the dependency on keypoint detectors and
the corresponding computation burden. In highly challenging scenarios, such as
truncation and erasing, our method performs very robustly and yields much

collimated emission allowing for natural coherent links between arrays in free
space. However, a single-layer lattice can only efficiently absorb or emit
light symmetrically in the forward and backward directions. Here we show how a
bilayer lattice can absorb a single photon either incident from a single
direction or an arbitrary superposition of forward and backward propagating
components. The excitation can be stored in a subradiant state, transferred
coherently between different subradiant states, and released, again in an
arbitrary combination of highly collimated forward and backward propagating
components. We explain the directionality of single and bilayer arrays by a
symmetry analysis based on the scattering parities of different multipole
radiation components of collective excitations. The collective modes may
exhibit the conventional half-wave loss of fields near the array interface or
completely eliminate it. The proposed directional control of absorption and
emission paves the way for effective one-dimensional quantum communication
between multiple arrays, with single-photons propagating backward and forward
between quantum information-processing and storage stages.

dynamics through its behavior of thermodynamic quantities. In addition,
neutrinos are trapped in supernova cores and neutron star mergers and
frequently interact with matter to crucially affect dynamics in determining the
explosion mechanism and the final form of compact objects. Therefore, it is
essential to implement detailed processes of nuclear and neutrino physics in

$x\to\pm\infty$. We assume that $f$ is a locally Lipschitz function on

the asymptotic behavior of $u(x,t)$ as $t\to\infty$. In the first two parts of
this series we mainly considered the cases where either $\theta^-\neq

$\theta^\pm=\theta_0$, $f(\theta_0)=0$, and $\theta_0$ is a stable equilibrium
of the equation $\dot \xi=f(\xi)$. In all these cases we proved that the
corresponding solution $u$ is quasiconvergent -- if bounded -- which is to say
that all limit profiles of $u(\cdot,t)$ as $t\to\infty$ are steady states. The
limit profiles, or accumulation points, are taken in
$L^\infty_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$. In the present paper, we take on the case that
$\theta^\pm=\theta_0$, $f(\theta_0)=0$, and $\theta_0$ is an unstable

theorem in this case involved some restrictive technical conditions on the
solution, which we now remove. Our sole condition on $u(\cdot,t)$ is that it is
nonoscillatory (has only finitely many critical points) at some $t\geq 0$.
Since it is known that oscillatory bounded solutions are not always
quasiconvergent, our result is nearly optimal.

characterize binary merger remnants and to test general relativity. These
analyses assume linear black hole perturbation theory, in particular that the
ringdown can be described in terms of quasinormal modes even for times
approaching the merger. Here we investigate a nonlinear effect during the
ringdown, namely how a mode excited at early times can excite additional modes
as it is absorbed by the black hole. This is a third-order secular effect: the
change in the black-hole mass causes a shift in the mode spectrum, so that the
original mode is projected onto the new ones. Using nonlinear simulations, we
study the ringdown of a spherically-symmetric scalar field around an
asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole, and we find that this
""absorption-induced mode excitation"" (AIME) is the dominant nonlinear effect.
We show that this effect takes place well within the nonadiabatic regime, so we
can analytically estimate it using a sudden mass-change approximation. Adapting
our estimation technique to asymptotically-flat Schwarzschild black holes, we
expect AIME to play a role in the analysis and interpretation of current and
future gravitational wave observations.

There are two fundamentally different support theories for them: a
cohomological one and a universal one based on the noncommutative Balmer
spectra of their stable (triangulated) categories $\underline{\bf T}$.
  In this paper we introduce the key notion of the categorical center
$C^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$ of the cohomology ring
$R^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$ of an FTC, $\bf T$. This enables us to put
forward a complete and detailed program for determining the exact relationship
between the two support theories, based on $C^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$ of
the cohomology ring $R^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$ of an FTC, $\bf T$.
  More specifically, we construct a continuous map from the noncommutative
Balmer spectrum of an FTC, $\bf T$, to the $\text{Proj}$ of the categorical
center $C^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$, and prove that this map is surjective
under a weaker finite generation assumption for $\bf T$ than the one
conjectured by Etingof-Ostrik. Under stronger assumptions, we prove that (i)
the map is homeomorphism and (ii) the two-sided thick ideals of $\underline{\bf

  We conjecture that both results hold for all FTCs. Many examples are
presented that demonstrate how in important cases $C^\bullet_{\underline{\bf

the two-sided thick ideals of $\underline{\bf T}$ are determined in a uniform
fashion. The majority of our results are proved in the greater generality of

in the present work we manage to remove the perturbative assumption on the
contact angle being close to ninety degree. We establish under usual
double-well type assumptions on the potential and for a certain class of
boundary energy densities the sub-optimal convergence rate of order
$\smash{\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}}}$ for general contact angles $\alpha \in

obtain from our methods a sharp convergence rate of order $\varepsilon$; again
for general contact angles $\alpha \in (0,\pi)$.
  Our proof deviates from the popular strategy based on rigorous asymptotic

Instead, we follow the recent approach by Fischer, Laux and Simon (SIAM J.

a careful adaptation of their approach in order to encode the constant contact

state-of-the-art CTS forecasting performance employ a variety of
spatio-temporal (ST) blocks that are able to model temporal dependencies and
spatial correlations among time series. However, two challenges remain. First,
ST-blocks are designed manually, which is time consuming and costly. Second,
existing forecasting models simply stack the same ST-blocks multiple times,
which limits the model potential. To address these challenges, we propose
AutoCTS that is able to automatically identify highly competitive ST-blocks as
well as forecasting models with heterogeneous ST-blocks connected using diverse

Specifically, we design both a micro and a macro search space to model possible

and we provide a search strategy that is able to jointly explore the search
spaces to identify optimal forecasting models. Extensive experiments on eight

images in source domain, how about its performance to directly segment CT
images in target domain? This setting, namely generalizable cross-modality
segmentation, owning its clinical potential, is much more challenging than
other related settings, e.g., domain adaptation. To achieve this goal, we in
this paper propose a novel dual-normalization model by leveraging the augmented
source-similar and source-dissimilar images during our generalizable
segmentation. To be specific, given a single source domain, aiming to simulate
the possible appearance change in unseen target domains, we first utilize a
nonlinear transformation to augment source-similar and source-dissimilar
images. Then, to sufficiently exploit these two types of augmentations, our
proposed dual-normalization based model employs a shared backbone yet
independent batch normalization layer for separate normalization. Afterward, we
put forward a style-based selection scheme to automatically choose the
appropriate path in the test stage. Extensive experiments on three publicly
available datasets, i.e., BraTS, Cross-Modality Cardiac, and Abdominal
Multi-Organ datasets, have demonstrated that our method outperforms other
state-of-the-art domain generalization methods. Code is available at

reduces to effective theories of Polyakov loops depending on the parameters of

at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential in 1+1d and 2+1d,
respectively. In 1d the method is applied to the effective theories up to
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^4)$. Using the transfer matrix, the recursion relations are
solved analytically. The thermodynamic limit is taken for some observables.
Afterwards, continuum extrapolation is performed numerically and results are
discussed. In 2d the coarse graining method is applied in the pure gauge and
static quark limit. Running couplings are obtained and the fixed points of the

stellar wind 25 times weaker than solar, we could reproduce the non-detection
only assuming a He to H abundance ratio about 16 times smaller than solar.
Instead, considering a stellar wind 10 times stronger than solar, we could
reproduce the non-detection only with a He to H abundance ratio about 10 times

past HeI measurements looking for correlations with stellar high-energy

only planet with a sub-solar estimated He to H abundance ratio, suggesting the
presence of efficient physical mechanisms (e.g. phase separation, magnetic
fields) capable of significantly modifying the He to H content in the upper
atmosphere of hot Jupiters. The planetary macroscopic properties and the shape
of the stellar spectral energy distribution are not sufficient for predicting
the presence or absence of detectable metastable He in a planetary atmosphere,
as also the He abundance appears to play a major role.

this work, we studied the evolution of the quantum universe non-perturbatively
using the closed real-time path integral. The environments coupled to the
quantum universe being considered are the radiation, the non-relativistic
matter, or the dark matter. We evaluated the influence functional of the
massless scalar field coupled with the flat FRW universe. We studied the
evolution of the quantum universe by setting the initial state of spacetime as
a Gaussian wave packet. In different scenarios, we show that the classical
trajectory of the universe is consistent with the quantum evolution of the wave
packet. The coherence, the absolute quantum fluctuation and the Gibbs entropy
all monotonically increase with time, yet the relative quantum fluctuation
decreases with time. We show that for a given size of the radiation dominated
universe, the lower temperature corresponds to a more quantum universe. We find
that the minimal coupling of the free massless scalar field with the flat FRW
spacetime generally gives rise to the memory characterized via non-Markovian
correlations. Finally, we show that under higher radiation temperatures, a
small universe has a higher chance of a transition to a bigger universe.

emotions under different contexts. Therefore, modeling long-range contextual
emotional relationships with speaker dependency plays a crucial part in
dialogue emotion recognition. Meanwhile, distinguishing the different emotion
categories is non-trivial since they usually have semantically similar
sentiments. To this end, we adopt supervised contrastive learning to make
different emotions mutually exclusive to identify similar emotions better.
Meanwhile, we utilize an auxiliary response generation task to enhance the
model's ability of handling context information, thereby forcing the model to
recognize emotions with similar semantics in diverse contexts. To achieve these
objectives, we use the pre-trained encoder-decoder model BART as our backbone
model since it is very suitable for both understanding and generation tasks.
The experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our proposed model obtains
significantly more favorable results than the state-of-the-art model in

its length $l$, for short as well as long tubes. We do so for $N=3,5,6$ and two
different values of the lattice spacing. Our states are characterised by the
quantum numbers of spin $J$, transverse parity $P_{\perp}$, longitudinal parity
$P_{\parallel}$ as well as by the longitudinal momentum $p_{\parallel}$. Our
extended basis of operators used in combination with the generalized eigenvalue
method enables us to extract masses for all irreducible representations
characterised by $\{ |J|,P_{\perp},P_{\parallel} \}$. We confirm that most of
the low-lying states are well described by the spectrum of the
Goddard-Goldstone-Rebbi-Thorn string. In addition we provide strong evidence,
that in addition to string like states, massive modes exist on the world-sheet.
More precisely the ground state with quantum numbers ${|J|}^{P_{\perp},
P_{\parallel}}=0^{--}$ exhibits a behaviour which is in agreement with the
interpretation of being an axion on the world-sheet of the flux-tube. This
state arises from a topological interaction term included in the effective
world-sheet action. In addition we observe that the second excited state with
${|J|}^{P_{\perp}, P_{\parallel}}=0^{++}$ behaves as a massive mode with mass
twice that of the axion.

value correction benefits bias alleviation, where we propose the
generalized-activated weighting operator that uses any non-decreasing function,
namely activation function, as weights for better value estimation.
Particularly, we integrate the generalized-activated weighting operator into
value estimation and introduce a novel algorithm, Generalized-activated Deep
Double Deterministic Policy Gradients (GD3). We theoretically show that GD3 is
capable of alleviating the potential estimation bias. We interestingly find
that simple activation functions lead to satisfying performance with no

this paper, we propose a novel attention-based approach to human activity
recognition using multiple IMU sensors worn at different body locations.
Firstly, a sensor-wise feature extraction module is designed to extract the
most discriminative features from individual sensors with Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). Secondly, an attention-based fusion mechanism is developed to
learn the importance of sensors at different body locations and to generate an
attentive feature representation. Finally, an inter-sensor feature extraction
module is applied to learn the inter-sensor correlations, which are connected
to a classifier to output the predicted classes of activities. The proposed
approach is evaluated using five public datasets and it outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on a wide variety of activity categories.

transport of tracers, nutrients and pollutants. The extent to which river
plumes influence the overall circulation, however, is generally poorly
constrained. This work focuses on the South China Sea (SCS) and quantifies the
dynamical impacts of the Mekong River plume, which is bound to significantly
change in strength and seasonality in the next 20 years if the construction of
over hundred dams moves ahead as planned. The dynamic impact of the freshwater
fluxes on the SCS circulation are quantified by comparing submesoscale
permitting and mesoscale resolving simulations with and without riverine input
between 2011 and 2016. In the summer and early fall, when the Mekong discharge
is at its peak, the greater stratification causes a residual mesoscale
circulation through enhanced baroclinic instability. The residual circulation
is shaped as an eddy train of positive and negative vorticity. Submesoscale
fronts are responsible for transporting the freshwater offshore, shifting
eastward the development of the residual mesoscale circulation, and further
strengthening the residual eddy train in the submesoscale permitting case.
Overall, the northward transport near the surface is intensified in the
presence of riverine input. The significance of the mesoscale-induced and
submesoscale-induced transport associated with the river plume is especially
important in in the second half of the summer monsoon season, when primary
productivity has a secondary maximum. Circulation changes, and therefore
productivity changes, should be anticipated if human activities modify the
intensity and seasonality of the Mekong River plume.

subjected to equivalent load conditions. The introduced design is the first

action between the three outputs is realised passively by a symmetric
arrangement of three two-output open differentials and three two-input open

each round (partial participation) when the number of participants is large and
the server's communication bandwidth is limited. Recent works on the
convergence analysis of FL have focused on unbiased client sampling, e.g.,
sampling uniformly at random, which suffers from slow wall-clock time for
convergence due to high degrees of system heterogeneity and statistical

that tackles both system and statistical heterogeneity to minimize the
wall-clock convergence time. We obtain a new tractable convergence bound for FL
algorithms with arbitrary client sampling probabilities. Based on the bound, we
analytically establish the relationship between the total learning time and
sampling probabilities, which results in a non-convex optimization problem for

active matter. Yet, current active matter endeavors are limited largely to
single force-generating components acting on a single substrate, far from the
composite cytoskeleton in cells. Here, we engineer actin-microtubule
double-networks, driven by kinesin and myosin motors and tuned by crosslinkers,
to ballistically restructure and flow with speeds that span three orders of
magnitude depending on the composite formulation and time relative to the onset
of motor activity. Differential dynamic microscopy analyses reveal that kinesin
and myosin compete to delay the onset of acceleration and suppress discrete
restructuring events, while passive crosslinking of either actin or
microtubules has an opposite effect. Our minimal advection-diffusion model and
spatial correlation analyses correlate these dynamics to structure, with motor
antagonism suppressing reconfiguration and de-mixing, while crosslinking
enhances clustering. Despite the rich formulation space and emergent
formulation-dependent structures, the non-equilibrium dynamics across all
networks and timescales can be organized into three classes: slow isotropic
reorientation, fast directional flow, and multimode restructuring. Moreover,
our mathematical model demonstrates that diverse structural motifs can arise
simply from the interplay between motor-driven advection and frictional drag.
These general features of our platform facilitate applicability to other active

economic risk is transformed into a qualitative economic severity

estimated for different temporal horizons and time periods providing an

possible to overcome the fundamental limit of precision found for classical
parameter-estimation protocols. The scaling of the quantum Fisher information
-- which provides an upper bound to the achievable precision -- with respect to
the protocol duration is then of primarily importance to assess its
performances. In classical protocols the quantum Fisher information scales
linearly with time, while typical quantum-enhanced strategies achieve a
quadratic (Heisenberg) or even higher-order polynomial scalings. Here we report
a protocol that is capable of surpassing the polynomial scaling, and yields an
exponential advantage. Such exponential advantage is achieved by approaching,
but without crossing, the critical point of a quantum phase transition of a
fully-connected model in the thermodynamic limit. The exponential advantage
stems from the breakdown of the adiabatic condition close to a critical point.
As we demonstrate, this exponential scaling is well captured by the new bound
derived in arXiv:2110.04144, which in turn allows us to obtain approximate
analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information that agree with exact
numerical simulations. In addition, we discuss the limitations to the
exponential scaling when considering a finite-size system as well as its
robustness against decoherence effects. Hence, our findings unveil a novel
quantum metrological protocol whose precision scaling goes beyond the
paradigmatic Heisenberg limit with respect to the protocol duration.

approaches that rely on decoding a latent feature to recover the complete
shape, often lead to the completed point cloud being over-smoothing, losing

refine a low-resolution (low-res) point cloud first, and then performs a
patch-wise noise-aware upsampling rather than interpolating the whole sparse
point cloud at once, which tends to lose details. Regarding the possibility of
lacking details of the initially decoded low-res point cloud, we propose an
iterative refinement to recover the geometric details and a symmetrization
process to preserve the trustworthy information from the input partial point
cloud. After obtaining a sparse and complete point cloud, we propose a
patch-wise upsampling strategy. Patch-based upsampling allows to better recover
fine details unlike decoding a whole shape, however, the existing upsampling
methods are not applicable to completion task due to the data discrepancy
(i.e., input sparse data here is not from ground-truth). Therefore, we propose
a patch extraction approach to generate training patch pairs between the sparse

noisy points from the sparse point cloud. Together with the low-res recovery,
our whole method is able to achieve high-fidelity point cloud completion.
Comprehensive evaluations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the

variability, minimum variability timescale, power spectral density analyses and
countrate distribution were performed. In addition, we fitted various spectral
models to the observations as well as estimated hardness ratio. The results
show that the sources are moderately variable within the intra-day timescale.
Three of the four sources exhibited a clear bi-modal pattern in their countrate
distribution revealing possible indication of two distinct countrate states,
that is, hard and soft countrate states. The slope indices of the power
spectral density were found to be centered around 0.5. Furthermore, the spectra
of the sources were fitted with single power-law, broken power-law,
log-parabolic and black-body+log-parabolic models (the latter only for OJ 287).
We conclude that for most of the observations log-parabolic model was the best
fit. The power spectral density analysis revealed the variable nature of PSD
slopes in the source light curves. The results of this analysis could indicate
the non-stationary nature of the blazar processes on intra-day timescales. The
observed features can be explained within the context of current blazar models,

demonstrated that one-dimensional DQPTs can be produced by two distinct

leading to the definition of precession (pDQPTs) and entanglement (eDQPTs)

investigate the notion of p- and eDQPTs in two-dimensional systems by
considering semi-infinite ladders of varying width. For square lattices, we
find that pDQPTs and eDQPTs persist and are characterized by similar
phenomenology as in 1D: pDQPTs are associated with a magnetization sign change
and a wide entanglement gap, while eDQPTs correspond to suppressed local
observables and avoided crossings in the entanglement spectrum. However, DQPTs
show higher sensitivity to the ladder width and other details, challenging the
extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit especially for eDQPTs. Moving to
honeycomb lattices, we also demonstrate that lattices with odd number of
nearest neighbors give rise to phenomenologies beyond the one-dimensional

eddy current regime and works both for surfaces of genus $0$ and $1$.
Well-conditioned systems and field representations are obtained despite the
Maxwell transmission problem being ill-conditioned for genus $1$ surfaces due
to the presence of Neumann eigenfields. Furthermore, it is shown that these
eigenfields, for ordinary conductors in the eddy current regime, are different
from the classical Neumann eigenfields for superconductors. Numerical examples,
based on the reformulation, give an unprecedented $13$-digit accuracy both for
transmitted and scattered fields.

  Learning Algorithmic Bias Detection",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fairness in decision-making has been a long-standing issue in our society.
Despite the increasing number of research activities on unfairness mitigation
in machine learning models, there is little research focusing on mitigating
unfairness in human decisions. Fairness in human decisions is as important as,
if not more important than, fairness in machine learning models since there are
processes where humans make the final decisions and machine learning models can
inherit bias from the human decisions they were trained on. As a result, this
work aims to detect unfairness in human decisions, the very first step of
solving the unfair human decision problem.
  This paper proposes to utilize the existing machine learning fairness
detection mechanisms to detect unfairness in human decisions. The rationale
behind this is, while it is difficult to directly test whether a human makes
unfair decisions, with current research on machine learning fairness, it is now
easy to test, on a large scale at a low cost, whether a machine learning model
is unfair. By synthesizing unfair labels on four general machine learning
fairness datasets and one image processing dataset, this paper shows that the
proposed approach is able to detect (1) whether or not unfair labels exist in
the training data and (2) the degree and direction of the unfairness. We
believe that this work demonstrates the potential of utilizing machine learning
fairness to detect human decision fairness. Following this work, research can
be conducted on (1) preventing future unfair decisions, (2) fixing prior unfair
decisions, and (3) training a fairer machine learning model.

analytical techniques and lattice simulations. We consider two-field models

\propto |\Phi - v|^p$ ($p\geq2$), and is coupled to a daughter field $X$
through a quadratic-quadratic interaction $g^2\Phi^2 X^2$. We consider two
situations, depending on whether the potential has a minimum at $i)$ $v = 0$,
or $ii)$ $v > 0$. In the scenario $i)$, the final energy transferred to $X$ is
independent of $g^2$ and entirely determined by $p$: it is negligible for $p <
4$, and of order $\sim 50\%$ for $p \geq 4$. The system goes to MD at late
times for $p = 2$, while it goes to RD for $p > 2$. In the later case, we can
calculate exactly the number of e-folds until RD as a function of $g^2$, and
hence predict accurately inflationary observables like the scalar tilt $n_s$
and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. In the scenario $ii)$, the energy is always
transferred completely to $X$ for $p>2$, as long as its effective mass $m_X^2 =
g^2(\Phi-v)^2$ is not negligible. For $p=2$, the final ratio between the energy
densities of $X$ and $\Phi$ depends strongly on $g^2$. For all $p \ge 2$, the
system always goes to MD at late times.

dispersion and galactic star formation rate, finding a tight correlation in
which sigma_Ha from galactic HII regions increases significantly from ~ 18-30
km/s broadly in keeping with previous studies. In contrast, sigma_Ha from
diffuse ionized gas (DIG) increases more rapidly from 20-60 km/s. Using the
statistical power of MaNGA, we investigate these correlations in greater detail
using multiple emission lines and determine that the observed correlation of
sigma_Ha with local star formation rate surface density is driven primarily by
the global relation of increasing velocity dispersion at higher total SFR, as
are apparent correlations with stellar mass. Assuming HII region models
consistent with our finding that sigma_[O III] < sigma_Ha < sigma_[O I], we
estimate the velocity dispersion of the molecular gas in which individual HII
regions are embedded, finding values sigma_Mol = 5-30 km/s consistent with ALMA
observations in a similar mass range. Finally, we use variations in the
relation with inclination and disk azimuthal angle to constrain the velocity
dispersion ellipsoid of the ionized gas sigma_z/sigma_r = 0.84 +- 0.03 and
sigma_phi/sigma_r = 0.91 +- 0.03, similar to that of young stars in the

increasingly used for convolutional neural network (CNN) inference. In
PIM-based CNN inference, the computational latency and energy are dependent on
how the CNN weights are mapped to the PIM array. A recent study proposed
shifted and duplicated kernel (SDK) mapping that reuses the input feature maps
with a unit of a parallel window, which is convolved with duplicated kernels to
obtain multiple output elements in parallel. However, the existing SDK-based
mapping algorithm does not always result in the minimum computing cycles
because it only maps a square-shaped parallel window with the entire channels.
In this paper, we introduce a novel mapping algorithm called variable-window
SDK (VW-SDK), which adaptively determines the shape of the parallel window that
leads to the minimum computing cycles for a given convolutional layer and PIM
array. By allowing rectangular-shaped windows with partial channels, VW-SDK
utilizes the PIM array more efficiently, thereby further reduces the number of
computing cycles. The simulation with a 512x512 PIM array and Resnet-18 shows
that VW-SDK improves the inference speed by 1.69x compared to the existing
SDK-based algorithm.

noncentrosymmetric superconductors can acquire finite momentum. Recent theory
predicts that such finite-momentum pairing can lead to an asymmetric critical
current, where a dissipationless supercurrent can flow along one direction but
not the opposite. However, to date this has not been observed. Here we report
the discovery of a giant Josephson diode effect (JDE) in Josephson junctions
formed from a type II Dirac semimetal, NiTe2. A distinguishing feature is that
the asymmetry in the critical current depends sensitively on the magnitude and
direction of an applied magnetic field and achieves its maximum value of ~60%
when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current and is of the order of
just 10 mT. Moreover the asymmetry changes sign several times with increasing
field. These characteristic features are accounted for in a theoretical model
based on finite-momentum Cooper pairing derived from spin-helical topological
surface states, in an otherwise centrosymmetric system. The finite pairing
momentum is further established, and its value determined, from the evolution
of the interference pattern under an in-plane magnetic field. The observed
giant magnitude of the asymmetry in critical current and the clear exposition
of its underlying mechanism paves the way to building novel superconducting
computing devices using the Josephson diode effect.

However, many practical challenges have to be overcome before all players could

inherent complexity of matching together geographically distributed peers and
the significant computation required to calculate the local matching
preferences. Hence dedicated algorithms are required to be able to perform a

present an in-depth study of this novel type of composite active matter. Its
transport properties result from the interactions of an active element (cell)

locomotion of the load-carrying cells, even exceeding their motility in the

micro-carries. As amoeboid locomotion is commonly observed for mammalian cells

used as supplementary information for consideration when implementing serial
testing strategies that employ a confirmatory PCR sample following a positive

that while this strategy reduces the number of false positives associated with
antigen test screening, it also increases the false negatives. We demonstrate
that the balance of trading false positives for false negatives only favours
the use of serial testing when the expected true prevalence is low. Our results
contain substantial uncertainty in the estimates for sensitivity due to the
relatively small number of positive test results over this period: validation
of our findings in a population with higher prevalence would therefore be
highly relevant for future work.

had time to evolve and contribute to the chemical enrichment. Low-mass
metal-poor stars survive until the present and provide fossil records of the
nucleosynthesis of early massive stars. On the other hand, short-lived
radionuclides (SLRs) in the early solar system (ESS) reflect the
nucleosynthesis of sources that occurred close to the proto-solar cloud in both
space and time. Both the ubiquity of Sr and Ba and the diversity of
heavy-element abundance patterns observed in single metal-poor stars suggest
that some neutron-capture mechanisms other than the r-process might have
operated in early massive stars. Three such mechanisms are discussed: the weak
s-process in non-rotating models with initial carbon enhancement, a new
s-process induced by rapid rotation in models with normal initial composition,
and neutron-capture processes induced by proton ingestion in non-rotating
models. In addition, meteoritic data are discussed to constrain the
core-collapse supernova (CCSN) that might have triggered the formation of the
solar system and provided some of the SLRs in the ESS. If there was a CCSN
trigger, the data point to a low-mass CCSN as the most likely candidate. An
11.8 solar mass CCSN trigger is discussed. Its nucleosynthesis, the evolution
of its remnant, and the interaction of the remnant with the proto-solar cloud
appear to satisfy the meteoritic constraints and can account for the abundances

overloads in both isotropic and anisotropic spatial networks, generated by
placing nodes in a square lattice and using various distributions of link
lengths and angles. Anisotropy has not been earlier considered in the
Motter-Lai model and is a real feature that may affect the cascading failures.
This could reflect the existence of a preferred direction in which a given
attribute of the system manifests, such as power lines that follow a city built
parallel to the coast. We show that the anisotropy causes a greater spread of
damage along the preferential direction of links. We also identify the critical
linear size, $l_c$, for a square shaped localized attack, which satisfies with
high probability that above $l_c$ the cascading disrupts the giant component of
functional nodes, while below $l_c$ the damage does not spread. We find that,
for networks with any characteristic link length, their robustness decreases
with the strength of the anisotropy. We show that the value of $l_c$ is finite
and independent of the system size (for large systems), both for isotropic and
anisotropic networks. Thus, in contrast to random attacks, where the critical
fraction of nodes that survive the initial attack, $p_c$, is usually below 1,
here $p_c = 1$. Note that the analogy to $p_c = 1$ is also found for localized
attacks in interdependent spatial networks. Finally, we measure the final
distribution of functional cluster sizes and find a power-law behavior, with
exponents similar to regular percolation. This indicates that, after the
cascade which destroys the giant component, the system is at a percolation
critical point. Additionally, we observe a crossover in the value of the
distribution exponent, from critical percolation in a two-dimensional lattice
for strong spatial embedding, to mean-field percolation for weak embedding.

(electrons and ions) was uniformly sourced with an ion temperature of 0.026 eV
and different electron temperatures (0.1 - 50 eV). Ion heating was observed
when the electron-to-ion temperature ratio exceeded the minimum value predicted
by linear response theory to excite ion-acoustic instabilities at the sheath
edge ($T_e/T_i\approx28$). When this threshold was exceeded, the temperature
equilibriation rate between ions and electrons rapidly increased near the
sheath so that the local temperature ratio did not significantly exceed the
threshold for instability. This resulted in significant ion heating near the
sheath edge, which also extended back into the bulk plasma; presumably due to
wave reflection from the sheath. This ion-acoustic wave heating mechanism was
found to decrease for higher neutral pressures, where ion-neutral collisions
damp the ion-acoustic waves and ion heating is instead dominated by inelastic
collisions in the presheath.

efficiently compress P-frames relative to the previous frame. We further lower
the bitrate by storing the network weights with learned integer quantization.
Our method, which we call implicit pixel flow (IPF), offers several

improve the speech enhancement performance with self-supervised learning.
Within the pre-training autoencoder (PAE), only a limited set of clean speech
signals are required to learn their latent representations. Meanwhile, to solve
the limitation of single pre-task, the proposed masking module exploits the
dereverberated mask and estimated ratio mask to denoise the mixture as the
second pre-task. Different from the PAE, where the target speech signals are
estimated, the downstream task autoencoder (DAE) utilizes a large number of
unlabeled and unseen reverberant mixtures to generate the estimated mixtures.
The trained DAE is shared by the learned representations and masks.
Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

significant slump in economic activities around the globe. This slump has met
by various policy actions to cushion the detrimental socio-economic
consequences of the COVID-19 crisis and eventually bring the economy back on
track. We provide an ex-ante evaluation of the effectiveness of a massive
increase in research and innovation (R&I) funding in Finland to stimulate
post-crisis recovery growth through an increase in R&I activities of Finnish
firms. We make use of the fact that novel R&I grants for firms in disruptive
circumstances granted in 2020 were allocated through established R&I policy
channels. This allows us to estimate the structural link between R&I funding
and economic growth for Finnish NUTS-3 regions using pre-COVID-19 data.
Estimates are then used to forecast regional recovery growth out of sample and
to quantify the growth contribution of R&I funding. Depending on the chosen
scenario, our forecasts point to a mean recovery growth rate of GDP between
2-4% in 2021 after a decline of up to -2.5% in 2020. R&I funding constitutes a
significant pillar of the recovery process with mean contributions in terms of
GDP growth of between 0.4% and 1%.

many industrial activities and fluid stirring by flow reorientation is a common
way to enhance this process. However, ""How best to stir?"" remains a major
challenge. This study aims to contribute to existing solutions by the
development of a dedicated flow-control strategy for the fast heating of a cold
fluid via a hot boundary in a representative case study. Fluid deformation acts
as the ""thermal actuator"" via which the flow affects heat transfer yet this may
both enhance and diminish heat exchange between fluid parcels and thus
restricts the beneficial impact of flow. Moreover, the impact of fluid
deformation on the global fluid heating is primarily confined to the proximity
of the moving boundary that drives the flow. These insights make incorporation
of thermal behaviour essential for effective flow-based enhancement strategies
and expose fluid mixing, the conventional approach in industry, as potentially
sub-optimal. The notion that global heating encompasses two concurrent
processes, i.e. increasing energy content and thermal homogenisation, yields
the relevant metrics for the formulation of the control problem as the
minimisation of a dedicated cost function. This facilitates step-wise
determination of the ""best"" flow reorientation from predicted future evolutions
of actual intermediate states and thereby paves the way to (real-time)
regulation of scalar transport by flow control. Performance analyses reveal
that this ""adaptive flow reorientation"" significantly accelerates fluid heating
and thus is superior to conventional periodic schemes (designed for efficient
fluid mixing) both in consistency and effectiveness. The controller in fact
never selects these periodic schemes and achieves the same superior performance
for all flow conditions irrespective of whether said mixing occurs.

However, DNNs can exhibit erroneous behaviours that may lead to critical
errors, especially when used in safety-critical systems. Inspired by testing
techniques for traditional software systems, researchers have proposed neuron
coverage criteria, as an analogy to source code coverage, to guide the testing
of DNN models. Despite very active research on DNN coverage, several recent
studies have questioned the usefulness of such criteria in guiding DNN testing.
Further, from a practical standpoint, these criteria are white-box as they
require access to the internals or training data of DNN models, which is in
many contexts not feasible or convenient. In this paper, we investigate
black-box input diversity metrics as an alternative to white-box coverage
criteria. To this end, we first select and adapt three diversity metrics and
study, in a controlled manner, their capacity to measure actual diversity in
input sets. We then analyse their statistical association with fault detection
using four datasets and five DNN models. We further compare diversity with
state-of-the-art white-box coverage criteria. Our experiments show that relying
on the diversity of image features embedded in test input sets is a more
reliable indicator than coverage criteria to effectively guide the testing of
DNNs. Indeed, we found that one of our selected black-box diversity metrics far
outperforms existing coverage criteria in terms of fault-revealing capability
and computational time. Results also confirm the suspicions that
state-of-the-art coverage metrics are not adequate to guide the construction of
test input sets to detect as many faults as possible with natural inputs.

result, iterative prototyping and evaluation with users is critical to
attaining adequate solutions that afford transparency. However, following
human-centered design principles in healthcare and medical image analysis is
challenging due to the limited availability of and access to end users. To
investigate the state of transparent ML in medical image analysis, we conducted
a systematic review of the literature. Our review reveals multiple severe
shortcomings in the design and validation of transparent ML for medical image
analysis applications. We find that most studies to date approach transparency
as a property of the model itself, similar to task performance, without
considering end users during neither development nor evaluation. Additionally,
the lack of user research, and the sporadic validation of transparency claims
put contemporary research on transparent ML for medical image analysis at risk
of being incomprehensible to users, and thus, clinically irrelevant. To
alleviate these shortcomings in forthcoming research while acknowledging the

guideline, a systematic design directive for transparent ML systems in medical

nature, comparing their Doppler effects is instructive and reveals persistent
conceptual traps. The principle of the Doppler effect was presented by
Christian Doppler in 1842 long before the advent of relativity theory, but
while the relativistic Doppler effect is now well established, its
non-relativistic version retrospectively called classical, suffers from
misleading intuitions such as: (1) there is no transverse classical Doppler
effect; (2) the Galilean Doppler effect corresponds to the relativistic one
without Lorentz dilation factor. Additional pitfalls concern the sound Doppler
effect which, in addition to being Galilean, results from asymmetric
contributions of the sources and receptors and depends on a material medium for
its propagation, possibly modifying the effective velocity of the wave.
Moreover, contrary to light, the information on the sound Doppler effect and
the location of the source are transmitted through different channels, sound
and light respectively, thereby complicating data interpretation and increasing
confusion. A thorough revision is proposed here addressing these issues and
providing a complete set of new candidate Doppler formulas, non-collinear, two-
and three-dimensional and in their angular and linear versions.

electrically conducting, and permeable spheres that are exposed to an
oscillating homogeneous magnetic field. Our model predicts both amplitude and
phase of the induced field outside the spheres. The description is provided for
parallel and transverse excitation relative to the axis through the sphere
centers. This geometric decomposition allows the application of arbitrary
excitation field directions. Our approach is based on one dipole per sphere.
The origins of these secondary dipole fields are proposed to be found at
positions slightly displaced from the sphere centers to consider the mutual
interaction. This displacement and the resulting phase of the dipole moments
strongly depend on the distance between the spheres as well as on
complex-valued first and second order response factors, which contain material
properties and the oscillation frequency. We demonstrate the usefulness of our
displaced dipole model in terms of efficiency and accuracy compared to other
computationally simple approaches.

  Attribution","11 pages, 5 figures This paper has been accepted in KDD 2022",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multi-touch attribution (MTA), aiming to estimate the contribution of each
advertisement touchpoint in conversion journeys, is essential for budget
allocation and automatically advertising. Existing methods first train a model
to predict the conversion probability of the advertisement journeys with
historical data and calculate the attribution of each touchpoint using
counterfactual predictions. An assumption of these works is the conversion
prediction model is unbiased, i.e., it can give accurate predictions on any
randomly assigned journey, including both the factual and counterfactual ones.
Nevertheless, this assumption does not always hold as the exposed
advertisements are recommended according to user preferences. This confounding
bias of users would lead to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in the
counterfactual prediction and cause concept drift in attribution. In this
paper, we define the causal MTA task and propose CausalMTA to eliminate the
influence of user preferences. It systemically eliminates the confounding bias
from both static and dynamic preferences to learn the conversion prediction
model using historical data. We also provide a theoretical analysis to prove
CausalMTA can learn an unbiased prediction model with sufficient data.
Extensive experiments on both public datasets and the impression data in an
e-commerce company show that CausalMTA not only achieves better prediction
performance than the state-of-the-art method but also generates meaningful
attribution credits across different advertising channels.

news. Characterizing the content of the messages becomes vital for different
tasks, like breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, fake
users detection, information flow characterization and others. However, Twitter
posts are short and often less coherent than other text documents, which makes
it challenging to apply text mining algorithms to these datasets efficiently.
Tweet-pooling (aggregating tweets into longer documents) has been shown to
improve automatic topic decomposition, but the performance achieved in this
task varies depending on the pooling method.
  In this paper, we propose a new pooling scheme for topic modeling in Twitter,
which groups tweets whose authors belong to the same community (group of users
who mainly interact with each other but not with other groups) on a user
interaction graph. We present a complete evaluation of this methodology, state
of the art schemes and previous pooling models in terms of the cluster quality,
document retrieval tasks performance and supervised machine learning
classification score. Results show that our Community polling method
outperformed other methods on the majority of metrics in two heterogeneous
datasets, while also reducing the running time. This is useful when dealing
with big amounts of noisy and short user-generated social media texts. Overall,
our findings contribute to an improved methodology for identifying the latent
topics in a Twitter dataset, without the need of modifying the basic machinery
of a topic decomposition model.

capability of the algorithm is notably improved by using the home-field
advantage and the explicit model for the draws in the game. Moderate, but
notable improvement may be attained by introducing the weighting of the results
