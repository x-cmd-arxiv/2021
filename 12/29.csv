comparing third-party libraries and the app's own internals. To study this, we
examine the adoption of HTTPS, whether apps scan the device for other installed

the current state of Android apps, there has not been enough of an improvement
in terms of privacy and many issues still need to be addressed.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stab3753",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the pebble isolation mass for a planet on a fixed eccentric
orbit in its protoplanetary disc by conducting a set of 2D hydrodynamical
simulations including dust turbulent diffusion. A range of planet
eccentricities up to $e=0.2$ is adopted. Our simulations also cover a range of
$\alpha-$turbulent viscosities, and for each pair $\{\alpha,e\}$ the pebble
isolation mass is estimated as the minimum planet mass in our simulations such
that solids with a Stokes number $\gtrsim 0.05$ do not flow across the planet
orbit and remain trapped around a pressure bump outside the planet gap. For
$\alpha<10^{-3}$, we find that eccentric planets reach a well-defined pebble
isolation mass, which can be smaller than for planets on circular orbits when
the eccentricity remains smaller than the disc's aspect ratio. We provide a
fitting formula for how the pebble isolation mass depends on planet
eccentricity. However, for $\alpha > 10^{-3}$, eccentric planets cannot fully
stall the pebbles flow, and thus do not reach a well-defined pebble isolation
mass. Our results suggest that the maximum mass reached by rocky cores should
exhibit a dichotomy depending on the disc turbulent viscosity. While being
limited to ${\cal O}(10\,M_\oplus)$ in low-viscosity discs, this maximum mass
could reach much larger values in discs with a high turbulent viscosity in the
planet vicinity. Our results further highlight that pebble filtering by growing
planets might not be as effective as previously thought, especially in
high-viscosity discs, with important implications to protoplanetary discs
observations.

scientific applications, ranging from large-scale weather prediction to solving
partial differential equations. Stencil computations are characterized by three
unique properties: (1) low arithmetic intensity, (2) limited temporal data
reuse, and (3) regular and predictable data access pattern. As a result,
stencil computations are typically bandwidth-bound workloads, which only
experience limited benefits from the deep cache hierarchy of modern CPUs. In
this work, we propose Casper, a near-cache accelerator consisting of
specialized stencil compute units connected to the last-level cache (LLC) of a
traditional CPU. Casper is based on two key ideas: (1) avoiding the cost of
moving rarely reused data through the cache hierarchy, and (2) exploiting the
regularity of the data accesses and the inherent parallelism of the stencil
computation to increase the overall performance.
  With minimal changes in LLC address decoding logic and data placement, Casper
performs stencil computations at the peak bandwidth of the LLC. We show that,
by tightly coupling lightweight stencil compute units near to LLC, Casper
improves the performance of stencil kernels by 1.65x on average, while reducing
the energy consumption by 35% compared to a commercial high-performance
multi-core processor. Moreover, Casper provides a 37x improvement in

an intermediate state when a dielectric nematic, having polar disorder of its
molecular dipoles, transitions to the almost perfectly polar-ordered
ferroelectric nematic. This intermediate phase, which fills a 100-year-old void
in the taxonomy of smectics and which we term the ""smectic $Z_A$"", is
antiferroelectric, with the nematic director and polarization oriented parallel
to smectic layer planes, and the polarization alternating in sign from layer to
layer. The period of this polarization wave ($\sim$180 A) is mesoscopic,
corresponding to $\sim$40 molecules side-by-side, indicating that this lamellar
structure is collectively stabilized. A Landau free energy, originally
formulated to model incommensurate antiferroelectricity in crystals, describes
the key features of the nematic-Sm$Z_A$-ferroelectric nematic phase sequence.

To compensate the delay, we introduce a chain of $M$ sub-predictors that leads
to a nonlinear closed-loop ODE system, coupled with nonlinear
infinite-dimensional tail ODEs. We provide LMIs for $H^1$-stability and prove
that for any $r>0$, the LMIs are feasible provided $M$ and $N$ are large enough

magnetic current in the closed-loop coupling breaks down the reciprocity of
atom-photon interaction, resulting in an asymmetrical and even completely

example, we couple the single-atom cavity-QED (cQED) system to a strongly

unconventional photon blockade (UPB) always incorporates with the conventional
photon blockade (CPB) in the condition of maximum chirality. Furthermore, we
show that 1PB in the quasichiral regime combines the advantages of UPB and CPB,
demonstrating the perfect single-photon purity, higher efficiency, smooth time

use of different numerical methods for the numerical simulation of the fluid
flow depending on whether it is in the unsaturated or saturated zones. This
paper shows that using a high-resolution shock-capturing conservative method to
resolve the nonlinear governing coupled partial differential equations of a
three-phase immiscible fluid flow allows the numerical simulation of the system
through both zones providing a unitary vision (and resolution) of the migration
of an immiscible contaminant problem within a porous medium. In particular,
using different initial scenarios (including impermeable 'lenses' in

saturation profiles of the three-phases fluids flow in variably saturated

less than the water, or dense nonaqueous phase liquid, which has densities
greater than the water initially released in unsaturated dry soil. Our study
shows that the fate of the migration of immiscible contaminants in variably

conservative model, with different evolution depending on the value of the
system's physical parameters, including the contaminant density, and accurately
tracking the evolution of the sharp (shock) contaminant front.

radiometric survey method has been used that considers an increased ""time of

doing this: the first considers that this ""time of beam - on"" affects the sum
of the two components, leakage and scattered. In another method it is
considered that only the leakage component is affected by this extended ""time

for secondary walls with $U<1$ it can both overestimate or underestimate the
dose rates, depending on the parameters of the project.

learning problems. For instance, a large retailer may wish to learn product
demand at different stores to solve pricing or inventory problems, making it
desirable to learn jointly for stores serving similar customers; alternatively,
a hospital network may wish to learn patient risk at different providers to
allocate personalized interventions, making it desirable to learn jointly for
hospitals serving similar patient populations. Motivated by real datasets, we
study a natural setting where the unknown parameter in each learning instance
can be decomposed into a shared global parameter plus a sparse
instance-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage multitask learning
estimator that exploits this structure in a sample-efficient way, using a
unique combination of robust statistics (to learn across similar instances) and
LASSO regression (to debias the results). Our estimator yields improved sample
complexity bounds in the feature dimension $d$ relative to commonly-employed
estimators; this improvement is exponential for ""data-poor"" instances, which
benefit the most from multitask learning. We illustrate the utility of these
results for online learning by embedding our multitask estimator within
simultaneous contextual bandit algorithms. We specify a dynamic calibration of
our estimator to appropriately balance the bias-variance tradeoff over time,
improving the resulting regret bounds in the context dimension $d$. Finally, we
illustrate the value of our approach on synthetic and real datasets.

computational modeling of contact problems and the coupling of non-conforming
discretizations in the small deformation setting. The displacement field is
augmented by enriched terms that are associated with generalized degrees of
freedom collocated along non-conforming interfaces or contact surfaces. The
enrichment strategy effectively produces an enriched node-to-node
discretization that can be used with any constraint enforcement criterion; this
is demonstrated with both multiple-point constraints and Lagrange multipliers,
the latter in a generalized Newton implementation where both primal and
Lagrange multiplier fields are updated simultaneously. The method's ability to
ensure continuity of the displacement field -- without locking -- in mesh
coupling problems, and to transfer fairly accurate tractions at contact
interfaces -- without the need for contact stabilization -- is demonstrated by
means of several examples. In addition, we show that the formulation is stable
with respect to the condition number of the stiffness matrix by using a simple
Jacobi-like diagonal preconditioner.

As a representative work, the adaptive focus method (AdaFocus) has achieved a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and inference speed by dynamically
identifying and attending to the informative regions in each video frame.
However, AdaFocus requires a complicated three-stage training pipeline
(involving reinforcement learning), leading to slow convergence and is
unfriendly to practitioners. This work reformulates the training of AdaFocus as
a simple one-stage algorithm by introducing a differentiable
interpolation-based patch selection operation, enabling efficient end-to-end
optimization. We further present an improved training scheme to address the
issues introduced by the one-stage formulation, including the lack of
supervision, input diversity and training stability. Moreover, a
conditional-exit technique is proposed to perform temporal adaptive computation
on top of AdaFocus without additional training. Extensive experiments on six
benchmark datasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics,
Something-Something V1&V2, and Jester) demonstrate that our model significantly
outperforms the original AdaFocus and other competitive baselines, while being

inevitable domain gap between synthetic and real images. In previous methods,
the generation process is based on virtual scenes, and their synthetic training
data can not be changed according to different target real scenes
automatically. To handle this problem, we propose a novel Target-Aware
Generation pipeline to produce synthetic person images, called TAGPerson.
Specifically, it involves a parameterized rendering method, where the
parameters are controllable and can be adjusted according to target scenes. In
TAGPerson, we extract information from target scenes and use them to control
our parameterized rendering process to generate target-aware synthetic images,
which would hold a smaller gap to the real images in the target domain. In our
experiments, our target-aware synthetic images can achieve a much higher
performance than the generalized synthetic images on MSMT17, i.e. 47.5% vs.
40.9% for rank-1 accuracy. We will release this toolkit\footnote{\noindent Code

regarded as a major issue in Federated Learning (FL), causing a downturn in the

propose a novel Label-wise clustering algorithm that guarantees the
trainability among geographically dispersed heterogeneous local clients, by
selecting only the local models trained with a dataset that approximates into
uniformly distributed class labels, which is likely to obtain faster
minimization of the loss and increment the accuracy among the FL network.
Through conducting experiments on the suggested six common non-IID scenarios,
we empirically show that the vanilla FL aggregation model is incapable of
gaining robust convergence generating biased pre-trained local models and
drifting the local weights to mislead the trainability in the worst case.
Moreover, we quantitatively estimate the expected performance of the local
models before training, which offers a global server to select the optimal
clients, saving additional computational costs. Ultimately, in order to gain
resolution of the non-convergence in such non-IID situations, we design
clustering algorithms based on local input class labels, accommodating the
diversity and assorting clients that could lead the overall system to attain
the swift convergence as global training continues. Our paper shows that
proposed Label-wise clustering demonstrates prompt and robust convergence

regime we show that Fermi-liquid theory is consistent with Navier-Stokes
hydrodynamics at all temperatures. The soft modes are the ones familiar from
classical hydrodynamics that are controlled by the five conservation laws;
namely, two first-sound modes, two shear diffusion modes, and one heat
diffusion mode. These modes have a particle-like spectrum and are soft, or
scale invariant, at all temperatures. In the collisionless regime we show that
the entire single-particle distribution function is soft with a continuous part
of the spectrum. This continuous soft mode, which is well known but often not
emphasized, has important physical consequences, e.g., for certain quantum
phase transitions. In addition, there are the well known soft zero-sound
excitations that describe angular fluctuations of the Fermi surface; their
spectra are particle-like. They are unrelated to conservation laws, acquire a
mass at any nonzero temperature, and their number depends on the strength of
the quasiparticle interaction. We also discuss the fates of these two families
of soft modes as the temperature changes. With increasing temperature the size
of the collisionless regime shrinks, the damping of the modes grows, and
eventually all of the collisionless modes become overdamped. In their stead the
five hydrodynamic modes appear in the hydrodynamic regime at asymptotically low
frequencies. The two families of soft modes are unrelated and have very
different physical origins.In charged Fermi liquids the first-sound modes in
the hydrodynamic regime and the l=0 zero-sound modes in the collisionless

It appears in Fermi's golden rule for transition rates and is an important
input to the Hauser-Feshbach theory of compound nucleus reactions. We discuss
empirical models of level densities and summarize the main experimental methods
used to determine them. The microscopic calculation of level densities in the
presence of correlations is a challenging many-body problem. We review recent
microscopic approaches to calculate level densities. Mean-field and
combinatorial methods have been applied across the nuclear chart, but often
need to be augmented with empirical collective enhancement factors. The moment
method and the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) method are formulated
in the context of the configuration-interaction shell model approach, and
include correlations beyond the mean-field approximation.

nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics, however, a robust charge-exchange
reaction theory with quantified uncertainties is essential to extracting
reliable physics. Purpose: The goal of this work is to determine the
uncertainties due to optical potentials used in the theory for charge-exchange
reactions to isobaric analogue states. Method: We implement a two-body reaction
model to study (p,n) charge-exchange transitions and perform a Bayesian
analysis. We study the (p,n) reaction to the isobaric analog states of
$^{14}$C, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{90}$Zr targets over a range of beam energies. We
compare predictions using standard phenomenological optical potentials with
those obtained microscopically. Results: Charge-exchange cross sections are
reasonably reproduced by modern optical potentials. However, when uncertainties
in the optical potentials are accounted for, the resulting predictions of
charge-exchange cross sections have very large uncertainties. Conclusions: The
charge-exchange reaction cross section is strongly sensitive to the input
interactions, making it a good candidate to further constrain nuclear forces
and aspects of bulk nuclear matter. However, further constraints on the optical
potentials are necessary for a robust connection between this tool and the
underlying isovector properties of nuclei.

problems in terms of Bayes optimality in a so-called nonstandard extension of

consideration of improper priors or other generalized notions of Bayes
optimalitiy, the nonstandard extension is distinguished, in part, by having
priors that can assign ""infinitesimal"" mass in a sense that can be made
rigorous using results from nonstandard analysis. With these additional priors,
we find that, informally speaking, a decision procedure $\delta_0$ is
admissible in the original statistical decision problem if and only if, in the
nonstandard extension of the problem, the nonstandard extension of $\delta_0$
is Bayes optimal among the extensions of standard decision procedures with
respect to a nonstandard prior that assigns at least infinitesimal mass to
every standard parameter value. We use the above theorem to give further
characterizations of admissibility, one related to Blyth's method, one to a
condition due to Stein which characterizes admissibility under some regularity
assumptions; and finally, a characterization using finitely additive priors in
decision problems meeting certain regularity requirements. Our results imply
that Blyth's method is a sound and complete method for establishing
admissibility. Buoyed by this result, we revisit the univariate two-sample

100 million events) of data on EAS features in the range of E0 = 1-100 PeV from
the KASCADE-Grande experiment. It is shown that, in the primary-energy range of

from 1.5 to 2.1 for the heaviest nuclei. These results comply with the
conclusion drawn by the KASCADE-Grande Collaboration that the knee in the E0

theoretical models in elementary particle and nuclear physics, condensed
matter, and cosmology. A particularly interesting type of them is described by
the mathematical Hopf map from a hypersphere to an ordinary sphere, which in
the physical 3D space exhibits inter-linked circle-like or knotted localized
regions of constant order parameter values. Despite their prevalence in models,
such solitons remained experimentally elusive until recently, when hopfions
were discovered in colloids and chiral liquid crystals, whereas the so-called
""heliknotons"" were found both individually and within triclinic 3D lattices
while smoothly embedded in a helical background of chiral liquid crystals.
Constrained by mathematical theorems, stability of these 3D excitations is
thought to rely on a delicate interplay of competing free energy contributions,
requiring applied fields or confinement. Here we describe such 3D solitons in a
material system where no applied fields or confinement are required.
Nevertheless, electric fields allow for inter-transforming heliknotons and
hopfions to each other, as well as for 3D hopping-like dynamics arising from
nonreciprocal evolution of the molecular alignment field in response to
electric pulses. Stability of these solitons both in and out of equilibrium can
be enhanced by tuning anisotropy of parameters that describe energetic costs of
gradient components in the field, which is implemented through varying chemical
composition of liquid crystal mixtures. Numerical modelling reproduces fine
details of both the equilibrium structure and Hof-index-preserving
out-of-equilibrium evolution of the molecular alignment field during switching
and motions. Our findings may enable myriads of solitonic condensed matter
phases and active matter systems, as well as their technological applications.

constructs a hypergraph for each session to model the item correlations defined
by various contextual windows in the session simultaneously, to uncover item

consisting of four tuples in terms of a size vector, a natural frequency
tensor, a coupling strength tensor and admissible initial configuration. In
this way, the collection of all admissible Cauchy problems to the LT models is
equivalent to the space of characteristic symbols. On the other hand, we
introduce a binary operation, namely ""{\it fusion operation}"" as a binary
operation between the characteristic symbols. It turns out that the fusion
operation satisfies the associativity and admits the identity element in the
space of characteristic symbols which naturally forms a monoid. By virtue of
the fusion operation, the weakly coupled system of multiple LT models can be
obtained by applying the fusion operation of multiple characteristic symbols
corresponding to the LT models. As a concrete example, we consider a weak
coupling of the swarm sphere model and the Lohe matrix model, and provide a
sufficient framework leading to emergent dynamics to the proposed weakly
coupled model.

amplitude to tunnel, even at zero temperature. While this effect can generally
be neglected for gapped baths -- a key feature for superconducting qubits -- ,
it is possible for the bath to be gapped near the potential minima between
which the particle tunnels, but different minima to correspond to different
bath topologies. This enforces the bath to undergo gap closing along the
tunneling path. In this work, we investigate quantum tunneling in the presence
of such a topology-changing fermionic bath. We develop a field theory for this
problem, linking the instantons describing tunneling in a bath of $d$ space
dimensions to topological boundary modes of systems in $d+1$ dimensions, thus
stepping a level higher in a dimensional hierarchy. We study in detail a $d=1$
example, inspired by planar Josephson junctions where the particle coordinate
is the superconducting phase whose value sets the electronic topology. We find
that the topology change suppresses tunneling by a factor scaling exponentially
with the system size. This translates to a correspondingly enhanced suppression
of the energy splitting for the lowest-lying states, despite these being linear
combinations of states near potential minima where the bath is gapped. Our
results help to estimate the influence of charging energy on topological phases
arising due to the Josephson effect and, conversely, to assess the potential
utility of such topological systems as superconducting qubits. For
moderate-sized baths, the incomplete suppression of tunneling opens the
prospects of quantum-mechanical superpositions of many-body states of different
topology, including superpositions of states with and without Majorana
fermions.

$\textit{average-case}$ statistical distinguishability via random circuits.
  We prove that once a family of random circuits forms an $\delta$-approximate

inequalities. Notably, all of the distances utilize the Hilbert-Schmidt norm

derive upper bounds on the maximal ratio between worst-case and average-case
distances. For each dimension $d$ this ratio is at most $d^{\frac{1}{2}},\ d, \

a less significant level in the final coadd, as they are averaged down in a
stack of tens of exposures. We study this print-through vs mask width. In this

prospects for more complete removal of the low surface brightness tails of the

deconvolution methods have also been explored in ultrasound imaging to mitigate
the adverse effects of PSF. Unfortunately, these two steps have only been
considered separately in a sequential approach. Herein, a novel framework for
unifying beamforming and deconvolution in ultrasound image reconstruction is
introduced. More specifically, the proposed formulation is a regularized
inverse problem including two linear models for beamforming and deconvolution

direction method of multipliers algorithm to find the solution of the joint
optimization problem. The performance evaluation is presented on a set of
publicly available simulations, real phantoms, and in vivo data. Furthermore,

transportation networks, with the rapid growth of ride-hailing services such as
Uber and Lyft. Ride-hailing is typically complemented with ridepooling options,
which can reduce the negative externalities associated with ride-hailing
services and increase the utilization of vehicles. Determining optimal policies
for vehicle dispatching and pricing, two key components that enable MoD
services, are challenging due to their massive scale and online nature. The
challenge is amplified when the MoD platform offers exclusive (conventional
ride-hailing) and shared services, and customers have the option to select
between them. The pricing and dispatching problems are coupled because the
realized demand depends on the quality of service (i.e., whom to share rides
with) and the prices for each service type. We propose an integrated and
computationally efficient method for solving the joint pricing and dispatching
problem -- both when the problem is solved one request at a time or in batches
(a common strategy in the industry). The main results of this research include
showing that: (i) the sequential pricing problem has a closed-form solution
under a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model, and (ii) the batched pricing
problem is jointly concave in the expected demand distributions. To account for
the spatial evolution of supply and demand, we introduce so-called
retrospective costs to retain a tractable framework. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate how this framework yields significant profit increases using
taxicab data in Manhattan, New York City, compared to dynamic dispatching with
static pricing policies.

sound are utilised to understand surroundings from various dimensions. These
senses are combined together to achieve a synergistic effect where the learning
is more effectively than using each sense separately. For robotics, vision and
touch are two key senses for the dexterous manipulation. Vision usually gives
us apparent features like shape, color, and the touch provides local
information such as friction, texture, etc. Due to the complementary properties
between visual and tactile senses, it is desirable for us to combine vision and
touch for a synergistic perception and manipulation. Many researches have been
investigated about multimodal perception such as cross-modal learning, 3D
reconstruction, multimodal translation with vision and touch. Specifically, we
propose a cross-modal sensory data generation framework for the translation
between vision and touch, which is able to generate realistic pseudo data. By
using this cross-modal translation method, it is desirable for us to make up
inaccessible data, helping us to learn the object's properties from different
views. Recently, the attention mechanism becomes a popular method either in
visual perception or in tactile perception. We propose a spatio-temporal
attention model for tactile texture recognition, which takes both spatial
features and time dimension into consideration. Our proposed method not only
pays attention to the salient features in each spatial feature, but also models
the temporal correlation in the through the time. The obvious improvement
proves the efficiency of our selective attention mechanism. The spatio-temporal
attention method has potential in many applications such as grasping,
recognition, and multimodal perception.

increasingly important. In the context of morphological classification of
galaxies, we study the effects of perturbations in imaging data. In particular,
we examine the consequences of using neural networks when training on baseline
data and testing on perturbed data. We consider perturbations associated with
two primary sources: 1) increased observational noise as represented by higher
levels of Poisson noise and 2) data processing noise incurred by steps such as
image compression or telescope errors as represented by one-pixel adversarial
attacks. We also test the efficacy of domain adaptation techniques in
mitigating the perturbation-driven errors. We use classification accuracy,
latent space visualizations, and latent space distance to assess model
robustness. Without domain adaptation, we find that processing pixel-level
errors easily flip the classification into an incorrect class and that higher
observational noise makes the model trained on low-noise data unable to
classify galaxy morphologies. On the other hand, we show that training with
domain adaptation improves model robustness and mitigates the effects of these
perturbations, improving the classification accuracy by 23% on data with higher
observational noise. Domain adaptation also increases by a factor of ~2.3 the
latent space distance between the baseline and the incorrectly classified
one-pixel perturbed image, making the model more robust to inadvertent
perturbations.

time-incremental learning framework: given a dataset of labeled signal traces
with a common time horizon, we propose a method to predict the label of a
signal that is received incrementally over time, referred to as prefix signal.
Prefix signals are the signals that are being observed as they are generated,
and their time length is shorter than the common horizon of signals. We present
a novel decision-tree based approach to generate a finite number of Signal
Temporal Logic (STL) specifications from the given dataset, and construct a
predictor based on them. Each STL specification, as a binary classifier of
time-series data, captures the temporal properties of the dataset over time.
The predictor is constructed by assigning time-variant weights to the STL
formulas. The weights are learned by using neural networks, with the goal of
minimizing the misclassification rate for the prefix signals defined over the
given dataset. The learned predictor is used to predict the label of a prefix
signal, by computing the weighted sum of the robustness of the prefix signal
with respect to each STL formula. The effectiveness and classification
performance of our algorithm are evaluated on an urban-driving and a
naval-surveillance case studies.

react to changes in the network instantaneously without loss of throughput and
while keeping queues short. Due to its fast reaction time, our algorithm is
particularly well-suited for dynamic network environments and bursty traffic
patterns. We show analytically and empirically that PowerTCP can significantly
outperform the state-of-the-art in both traditional datacenter topologies and
emerging reconfigurable datacenters where frequent bandwidth changes make
congestion control challenging. In traditional datacenter networks, PowerTCP

even when the uniformly aligned host medium away from particles exhibits no
response to fields below the realignment threshold. Here we harness the
non-reciprocal nature of these facile electric responses to demonstrate
colloidal locomotion. Oscillations of electric field prompt repetitive
deformations of the corona of dipolar elastic distortions around the colloidal
inclusions, which at appropriately designed electric driving synchronize the
displacement directions. We observe the colloid-hedgehog dipole accompanied by
an umbilical defect in the tilt directionality field (c-field), along with the
texture of elastic distortions that evolves with changing applied voltage. The
temporal out-of-equilibrium evolution of the director and c-field distortions
around particles upon turning voltage on and off is not invariant upon reversal
of time, prompting lateral translations and interactions that markedly differ
from what is accessible to these colloids under equilibrium conditions. Our
findings may lead to both technological and fundamental science applications of

a general method for computing stationary distributions and steady-state

numerically solved by properly constructing a proxy Markov chain with finite

discrete distributions, including the empirical distributions generated by a

distribution of virtual waiting time in a G/G/1+G queue and associated
performance measures under certain mild but general differentiability and
boundedness assumptions on the inter-arrival, service, and patience time

dissipation in a material stemming from the material's internal structural
dynamics. It has been previously shown that a locally resonant elastic
metamaterial may be designed to exhibit higher or lower dissipation compared to
a statically equivalent phononic crystal with the same amount of prescribed
damping. Here we reveal that even further dissipation, or alternatively further
reduction of loss, may be reached in an inertially amplified metamaterial that
is also statically equivalent and has the same amount of prescribed damping.
This is demonstrated by a passive configuration whereby an attenuation peak is
generated by the motion of a mass supported by an inclined lever arm. We
further show that by coupling this inertially amplified attenuation peak with
that of a local resonance attenuation peak, a trade-off between the intensity
of spatial attenuation versus temporal attenuation is realized for a range of
the inclination angles. Design for performance along this trade-off is
therefore possible by adjustment of the lever angle. These findings open the
way for highly expanding the Ashby space for stiffness-damping capacity or
stiffness-spatial attenuation capacity through design of the internal structure

SPDEs with non-homogeneous stochastic boundary conditions (BCs), appropriate BC
must be specified for each of the TDBs. However, determining BCs for TDB is not
trivial because: (i) the dimension of the random BCs is different than the rank
of the TDB subspace; (ii) TDB in most formulations must preserve orthonormality

these constraints in the space-discretized form. In this work, we present a

holds back ERP images from being used as easily as conventional perspective
images. This is especially relevant when estimating 360{\deg} optical flow, as
the distortions need to be mitigated appropriately. In this paper, we propose a
360{\deg} optical flow method based on tangent images. Our method leverages
gnomonic projection to locally convert ERP images to perspective images, and
uniformly samples the ERP image by projection to a cubemap and regular
icosahedron vertices, to incrementally refine the estimated 360{\deg} flow
fields even in the presence of large rotations. Our experiments demonstrate the
benefits of our proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively.

  Bandit Feedback",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Due to the high cost of communication, federated learning (FL) systems need
to sample a subset of clients that are involved in each round of training. As a
result, client sampling plays an important role in FL systems as it affects the
convergence rate of optimization algorithms used to train machine learning
models. Despite its importance, there is limited work on how to sample clients
effectively. In this paper, we cast client sampling as an online learning task
with bandit feedback, which we solve with an online stochastic mirror descent
(OSMD) algorithm designed to minimize the sampling variance. We then
theoretically show how our sampling method can improve the convergence speed of
optimization algorithms. To handle the tuning parameters in OSMD that depend on
the unknown problem parameters, we use the online ensemble method and doubling
trick. We prove a dynamic regret bound relative to any sampling sequence. The
regret bound depends on the total variation of the comparator sequence, which
naturally captures the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. To the best of our
knowledge, these theoretical contributions are new and the proof technique is
of independent interest. Through both synthetic and real data experiments, we
illustrate advantages of the proposed client sampling algorithm over the widely
used uniform sampling and existing online learning based sampling strategies.
The proposed adaptive sampling procedure is applicable beyond the FL problem
studied here and can be used to improve the performance of stochastic
optimization procedures such as stochastic gradient descent and stochastic
coordinate descent.

the sequential decision-making in an uncertain environment. The MAB framework,

(e.g., pulling arms) directly. It is a practically important scenario in many
applications such as spectrum sharing, crowdsensing, and edge computing. In
these applications, the decision-maker would incentivize other selfish agents
to carry out desired actions (i.e., pulling arms on the decision-maker's

in the tight coupling of the unknown environment learning and asymmetric

fairness, incentive compatibility, and voluntary participation. It achieves the

mitigating attacks on image classification DNNs, namely, preprocessing
adversarial images using super resolution -- upscaling low-quality inputs into
high-resolution images. This defense requires running both image classifiers
and super resolution models on constrained autonomous systems. However, super
resolution incurs a heavy computational cost. Therefore, in this paper, we
investigate the following question: Does the robustness of image classifiers
suffer if we use tiny super resolution models? To answer this, we first review
a recent work called Super-Efficient Super Resolution (SESR) that achieves
similar or better image quality than prior art while requiring 2x to 330x fewer
Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. We demonstrate that despite being orders
of magnitude smaller than existing models, SESR achieves the same level of
robustness as significantly larger networks. Finally, we estimate end-to-end
performance of super resolution-based defenses on a commercial Arm Ethos-U55

inner crust of neutron stars and significance of the entrainment between

interpretations of various phenomena of neutron stars, it has been desired to
develop deeper understanding of the microphysics behind.
  Purpose: The purpose of the present article is to propose a fully
self-consistent microscopic framework for describing time-dependent dynamics of
neutron star matter, which allows us to explore diverse properties of nuclear
matter, including the entrainment effect.
  Results: As the first application of the time-dependent self-consistent band
theory for nuclear systems, we investigate the slab phase of nuclear matter
with various proton fractions. From a dynamic response of the system to an
external force, we extract the collective mass of a slab, associated with
entrained neutrons as well as bound nucleons. We find that the extracted
collective mass is smaller than a naive estimation based on a potential profile
and single-particle energies. We show that the reduction is mainly caused by
""counterflow"" of dripped neutrons towards the direction opposite to the motion
of the slabs. We interpret it as an ""anti-entrainment"" effect. As a result, the
number of effectively bound neutrons is reduced, indicating an enhancement of
the number density of conduction neutrons. We demonstrate that those findings
are consistent with a static treatment in the band theory of solids.

topological analysis that the time-reversal (TR) symmetry-broken quantum spin
Hall (QSH) state emerges in a two-dimensional ferromagnetic MnBi$_4$Te$_7$
monolayer. This TR-symmetry broken QSH phase possesses a highly tunable
nontrivial band gap under an external electric field (or tuning interlayer
distance). Furthermore, based on the Wannier-function-based tight-binding
approach, we reveal that a topological phase transition from the TR-symmetry
broken QSH phase to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phase occurs with the
increase of magnetic fields. Besides, we also find that a reverse electric

the ferromagnetic topological properties the MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ monolayer tuned by
electric and magnetic fields, but also can stimulate further applications to
spintronics and topological devices.

much higher in the stellar atmosphere compared to the silicon and the oxygen

These challenges make it difficult for traditional AI models to extract rare

overcome this limitation by proposing a novel approach for rare disease

of rare diseases, we design an attention-based meta-learning (ATML) approach
which dynamically adjusts the attention to different tasks according to the
measured training effect of base learners. Additionally, a dynamic-weight based
fusion strategy is proposed to further improve the accuracy of federated
learning, which dynamically selects clients based on the accuracy of each local

out-performs the original federated meta-learning algorithm in accuracy and

the equation u=v+s(v) has exactly n solutions. He gave the values K(2)=101,
K(3)=10^13+1, and conjectured that K(4)=10^24+102. In 1966 Narasinga Rao gave

apparently new recurrence for F(u), the number of solutions to u=v+s(v). We
illustrate our method by computing the values of K(n) for n <= 16 and bases b

determined by the classical Thue-Morse sequence, which leads us to define

  algorithm)",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate online convex optimization in non-stationary environments and
choose the dynamic regret as the performance measure, defined as the difference
between cumulative loss incurred by the online algorithm and that of any
feasible comparator sequence. Let $T$ be the time horizon and $P_T$ be the path
length that essentially reflects the non-stationarity of environments, the
state-of-the-art dynamic regret is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T(1+P_T)})$. Although
this bound is proved to be minimax optimal for convex functions, in this paper,
we demonstrate that it is possible to further enhance the guarantee for some
easy problem instances, particularly when online functions are smooth.
Specifically, we introduce novel online algorithms that can exploit smoothness
and replace the dependence on $T$ in dynamic regret with problem-dependent
quantities: the variation in gradients of loss functions, the cumulative loss
of the comparator sequence, and the minimum of these two terms. These
quantities are at most $\mathcal{O}(T)$ while could be much smaller in benign
environments. Therefore, our results are adaptive to the intrinsic difficulty
of the problem, since the bounds are tighter than existing results for easy
problems and meanwhile guarantee the same rate in the worst case. Notably, our
proposed algorithms can achieve favorable dynamic regret with only one gradient
per iteration, sharing the same gradient query complexity as the static regret
minimization methods. To accomplish this, we introduce the framework of
collaborative online ensemble. The proposed framework employs a two-layer
online ensemble to handle non-stationarity, and uses optimistic online learning
and further introduces crucial correction terms to facilitate effective
collaboration within the meta-base two layers, thereby attaining adaptivity. We
believe that the framework can be useful for broader problems.

readers by predicting their likelihood of clicking on a certain article. To
accurately predict this probability, plenty of studies have been proposed that
actively utilize content features of articles, such as words, categories, or
entities. However, we observed that the articles' contextual features, such as
CTR (click-through-rate), popularity, or freshness, were either neglected or
underutilized recently. To prove that this is the case, we conducted an
extensive comparison between recent deep-learning models and naive contextual
models that we devised and surprisingly discovered that the latter easily
outperforms the former. Furthermore, our analysis showed that the recent
tendency to apply overly sophisticated deep-learning operations to contextual
features was actually hindering the recommendation performance. From this
knowledge, we design a purposefully simple contextual module that can boost the
previous news recommendation models by a large margin.

intracellular cargoes along microtubule. Based on recent experimental

biochemical pathways. Our results show that both forward and futile cycles
consist of two biochemical pathways, while backward cycle may be realized
through six possible pathways. Backward motion of kinesin-1 is mainly through
backward sliding along microtubule when it is in semi-detach state, and usually
coupled with ATP hydrolysis. Under low external load, about 80\% of ATP is
wasted by kinesin-1, and this proportion of waste is almost independent of ATP
concentration. At high ATP concentration or under high external load, both
heads of kinesin are always in ATP or ADP$\cdot$Pi binding state and bind to
microtubule tightly. But at low ATP concentration and low load, kinesin mainly
stays at the one head bound state. In contrast to mean run length, the mean run
time of kinesin-1 along microtubule decreases with ATP concentration. Unless
external load is near the stall force, the motion of kinesin-1 is almost
deterministic, not as predicted by usual Browian ratchet models.

In addition to being an accurate global solver, this method has three
additional features. First, it is computationally efficient in solving complex

dimensionality. Second, it provides a general and interpretable representation
of the distribution over individual states, which is crucial in addressing the

annotations for object localization by using image-level classification masks
to supervise its learning process. However, current WSOL methods suffer from
excessive activation of background locations and need post-processing to obtain
the localization mask. This paper attributes these issues to the unawareness of
background cues, and propose the background-aware classification activation map
(B-CAM) to simultaneously learn localization scores of both object and
background with only image-level labels. In our B-CAM, two image-level
features, aggregated by pixel-level features of potential background and object
locations, are used to purify the object feature from the object-related
background and to represent the feature of the pure-background sample,
respectively. Then based on these two features, both the object classifier and
the background classifier are learned to determine the binary object
localization mask. Our B-CAM can be trained in end-to-end manner based on a
proposed stagger classification loss, which not only improves the objects
localization but also suppresses the background activation. Experiments show
that our B-CAM outperforms one-stage WSOL methods on the CUB-200, OpenImages

data -- let the test respect Zipf's law of nature -- the tail bias is no longer
beneficial overall because it hurts the head majorities. In this paper, we

empirically demonstrates that xERM fundamentally improves the classification by
learning better feature representation rather than the head vs. tail game.
Based on causality, we further theoretically explain why xERM achieves
unbiasedness: the bias caused by the domain selection is removed by adjusting
the empirical risks on the imbalanced domain and the balanced but unseen

typically time-consuming due to the constrained computation power of edge
devices and limited wireless resources in edge networks. In this paper, the
training time minimization problem is investigated in a quantized FEEL system,
where the heterogeneous edge devices send quantized gradients to the edge
server via orthogonal channels. In particular, a stochastic quantization scheme
is adopted for compression of uploaded gradients, which can reduce the burden
of per-round communication but may come at the cost of increasing number of
communication rounds. The training time is modeled by taking into account the
communication time, computation time and the number of communication rounds.
Based on the proposed training time model, the intrinsic trade-off between the
number of communication rounds and per-round latency is characterized.
Specifically, we analyze the convergence behavior of the quantized FEEL in
terms of the optimality gap. Further, a joint data-and-model-driven fitting
method is proposed to obtain the exact optimality gap, based on which the
closed-form expressions for the number of communication rounds and the total
training time are obtained. Constrained by total bandwidth, the training time
minimization problem is formulated as a joint quantization level and bandwidth
allocation optimization problem. To this end, an algorithm based on alternating
optimization is proposed, which alternatively solves the subproblem of
quantization optimization via successive convex approximation and the
subproblem of bandwidth allocation via bisection search. With different
learning tasks and models, the validation of our analysis and the near-optimal
performance of the proposed optimization algorithm are demonstrated by the
experimental results.

the Mobius and sine-square-deformed (SSD) Hamiltonians. After a quench by the
Mobius Hamiltonian, physical quantities such as von Neumann entropy for
subsystems exhibit periodic oscillations (quantum revival). On the other hand,
there is no quantum revival after a quench using the SSD Hamiltonian. Instead,
almost all the degrees of freedom of the system are asymptotically gathered at
a single point, the fixed point of the SSD Hamiltonian. This results in a
point-like excitation that carries as much information as the total thermal
entropy -- like a black hole. We call this excitation a black-hole-like
excitation. In contrast, parts of the system other than the fixed point
approach the low-entropy (low-temperature) state at late times, and the reduced
density matrix is given effectively by that of the ground state. When the CFT
admits a holographic dual description, these quenches induce inhomogeneous
deformations of the black hole in the bulk. In particular, after the quench by
the SSD Hamiltonian, at late enough times, the horizon of the bulk black hole
asymptotically ""touches"" the boundary. We also propose and demonstrate that our
quench setups can be used to simulate the formation and evaporation processes

the model quality, especially in Transformers. By routing tokens with a sparse
gate to a few experts (i.e., a small pieces of the full model), MoE can easily
increase the model parameters to a very large scale while keeping the
computation cost in a constant level. Most existing works just initialize some
random experts, set a fixed gating strategy (e.g., Top-k), and train the model
from scratch in an ad-hoc way. We identify that these MoE models are suffering
from the immature experts and unstable sparse gate, which are harmful to the
convergence performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient end-to-end MoE
training framework called EvoMoE. EvoMoE starts from training one single expert
and gradually evolves into a large and sparse MoE structure. EvoMoE mainly
contains two phases: the expert-diversify phase to train the base expert for a
while and spawn multiple diverse experts from it, and the gate-sparsify phase
to learn an adaptive sparse gate and activate a dynamic number of experts.
EvoMoE naturally decouples the joint learning of both the experts and the
sparse gate and focuses on learning the basic knowledge with a single expert at
the early training stage. Then it diversifies the experts and continues to
train the MoE with a novel Dense-to-Sparse gate (DTS-Gate). Specifically,
instead of using a permanent sparse gate, DTS-Gate begins as a dense gate that
routes tokens to all experts, then gradually and adaptively becomes sparser
while routes to fewer experts. Evaluations are conducted on three popular
models and tasks, including RoBERTa for masked language modeling task, GPT for
language modeling task and Transformer for machine translation task. The
results show that EvoMoE outperforms existing baselines, including Switch, BASE
Layer, Hash Layer and StableMoE.

interference between tree and long-distance penguin and penguin-exchange
amplitudes that pushes CP asymmetry difference between $D^0\to K^+K^-$ and
$\pi^+\pi^-$ modes up to the per mille level. Using the same mechanism, we find
that CP asymmetry can also occur at the $10^{-3}$ level in many of the $D\to
V\!P$ channels or otherwise be negligibly small. There are six golden modes
which have sufficiently large branching fractions and direct CP violation at
the per mille level. In particular, the direct CP asymmetry difference between
$D^0\to K^+K^{*-}$ and $\pi^+\rho^-$ is predicted to be $(-1.61\pm0.33)\times
10^{-3}$, very similar to the counterpart in the $P\!P$ sector. The LHCb's
observation of CP asymmetry difference can be explained within the standard

transport. This work employs Green's functions to study the charge transport
across representative Si/Ge interfaces. For perfect interfaces, it is found
that the transmittance is small and the contact resistance is high, not only
because the mismatch of carrier pockets makes it hard to meet the momentum
conservation requirement, but also because of the incompatible symmetries of
the Bloch wave functions of the two sides. In contrast, atomic mixing at the
interface increases the carrier transmittance as the interface roughness opens
many nonspecular transmission channels, which greatly reduces the contact
resistance compared with the perfect interface. Specifically, we show that
disordered interfaces with certain symmetries create more nonspecular
transmission. The insights from our study will benefit the future design of

scheduling objectives, namely the average flow time and the maximum flow time.
Specifically, Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) minimizes the average
flow time but may lead to job starvation. In contrast, First-Come-First-Served
(FCFS) minimizes the maximum flow time but may result in poor average flow
time. A natural way to balance these two objectives is to minimize the $\ell_2$
norm of flow time. For this problem, no online algorithm is known to achieve a
better competitive ratio than SRPT and FCFS.
  It can be argued that SRPT and FCFS complement each other. To exploit this
complementary relationship, we mitigate the starvation caused by SRPT with the
help of FCFS. Specifically, when there are starving jobs, we process the job
that becomes starving first. The main question is: when should a job be viewed
as starving? If the timing is too early or too late, then the algorithm still
behaves like FCFS or SRPT, respectively. In this paper, we answer the above
question by estimating the number of jobs. Our algorithm significantly improves
upon SRPT and FCFS in terms of the competitive ratio for minimizing the
$\ell_2$ norm of flow time, even if the estimate is loose.

LO typically changes from iteration to iteration, our convergence analysis is
completely different from those existing works in the literature on FW-type
methods that deal with fixed feasible regions among subproblems. Finally,
motivated by the away steps for accelerating FW-type methods for convex
problems, we further design an away-step oracle to supplement our nonconvex
FW-type method, and establish subsequential convergence of this variant.
Numerical results on the matrix completion problem are presented to demonstrate
the efficiency of the proposed FW-type method and its away-step variant via the
MovieLens10M dataset.

that the negative contributions are due to the enhanced ground-state

which enumerates all maximal k-biplexes. Existing methods suffer from
efficiency and/or scalability issues and have the time of waiting for the next
output exponential w.r.t. the size of the input bipartite graph (i.e., an
exponential delay). In this paper, we adopt a reverse search framework called
bTraversal, which corresponds to a depth-first search (DFS) procedure on an
implicit solution graph on top of all maximal k-biplexes. We then develop a
series of techniques for improving and implementing this framework including
(1) carefully selecting an initial solution to start DFS, (2) pruning the vast
majority of links from the solution graph of bTraversal, and (3) implementing
abstract procedures of the framework. The resulting algorithm is called
iTraversal, which has its underlying solution graph significantly sparser than
(around 0.1% of) that of bTraversal. Besides, iTraversal provides a guarantee
of polynomial delay. Our experimental results on real and synthetic graphs,

uncertainty, which we formulate as planning in the belief space. Maintaining
beliefs (i.e., distributions) over high-dimensional states (e.g., entire
trajectories) was not only shown to significantly improve accuracy, but also
allows planning with information-theoretic objectives, as required for the
tasks of active SLAM and information gathering. Nonetheless, planning under
this ""smoothing"" paradigm holds a high computational complexity, which makes it
challenging for online solution. Thus, we suggest the following idea: before
planning, perform a standalone state variable reordering procedure on the
initial belief, and ""push forwards"" all the predicted loop closing variables.
Since the initial variable order determines which subset of them would be
affected by incoming updates, such reordering allows us to minimize the total
number of affected variables, and reduce the computational complexity of
candidate evaluation during planning. We call this approach PIVOT: Predictive
Incremental Variable Ordering Tactic. Applying this tactic can also improve the
state inference efficiency; if we maintain the PIVOT order after the planning
session, then we should similarly reduce the cost of loop closures, when they
actually occur. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied PIVOT in a
realistic active SLAM simulation, where we managed to significantly reduce the
computation time of both the planning and inference sessions. The approach is
applicable to general distributions, and induces no loss in accuracy.

the fluctuating light fields of incident coupling beams, but also the
fluctuating nonlinear coefficient of interaction. At last, we highlight the
potentiality of applying such amplifier to other N-order nonlinear optical
effects.

they are barely able to support natural language search, but rather keyword
search. It seems that keyword based search will not be sufficient for
enterprise data which is growing extremely fast. Thus, enterprise search
becomes increasingly critical in corporate domain. In this report, we present
an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies in literature for three main
purposes: i) to increase the retrieval performance of a search engine, ii) to
deploy a search platform to a cloud environment, and iii) to select the best

  We propose a framework that allows us to apply non-private clustering

quantum error-correcting code. Since the GKP code only protects against small
shift errors in $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{q}$ quadratures, it is necessary to
concatenate the GKP code with a stabilizer code for the larger error
correction. In this paper, we consider the concatenation of the single-mode GKP
code with the two-dimension (2D) color code (color-GKP code) on the
square-octagon lattice. We use the Steane type scheme with a maximum-likelihood
estimation (ME-Steane scheme) for GKP error correction and show its advantage
for the concatenation. In our main work, the minimum-weight perfect matching
(MWPM) algorithm is applied to decode the color-GKP code. Complemented with the
continuous-variable information from the GKP code, the threshold of 2D color
code is improved. If only data GKP qubits are noisy, the threshold reaches
$\sigma\approx 0.59$ $(\bar{p}\approx13.3\%)$ compared with $\bar{p}=10.2\%$ of
the normal 2D color code. If measurements are also noisy, we introduce the
generalized Restriction Decoder on the three-dimension space-time graph for
decoding. The threshold reaches $\sigma\approx 0.46$ when measurements in the
GKP error correction are noiseless, and $\sigma\approx 0.24$ when all
measurements are noisy. Lastly, the good performance of the generalized
Restriction Decoder is also shown on the normal 2D color code giving the
threshold at $3.1\%$ under the phenomenological error model.

suffer from the challenges of the computational cost and acquisition of

network, when used in conjunction with the transfer learning method, enhances
learning efficiency and keeps predictability in the target task by common
characteristics knowledge from the source model without requiring a huge
quantity of datasets. The datasets obtained from VIV experiment are divided
evenly two parts (source domain and target domain), to evaluate the performance
of the model. The results show that the proposed method match closely with the
results available in the literature using conventional PINN algorithms even

control. The risk of log-returns is measured by weighted Value-at-Risk (WVaR),
which is a generalization of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES).
We characterize the optimal terminal wealth up to the concave envelope of a
certain function, and obtain analytical expressions for the optimal wealth and
portfolio policy when the risk is measured by VaR or ES. In addition, we find
that the efficient frontier is a concave curve that connects the minimum-risk
portfolio with the growth optimal portfolio, as opposed to the vertical line
when WVaR is used on terminal wealth. Our results advocate the use of mean-WVaR
criterion for log-returns instead of terminal wealth in dynamic portfolio
choice.

(N)-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules with
incorporation of N, NH and NH$_2$ using density functional theory (DFT). The
properties of their vibrational modes in 2--15 $\mu \rm m$ are investigated in
relation to the Unidentified Infrared (UIR) bands. It is found that neutral
PAHs, when incorporated with NH$_2$ and N (at inner positions), produce intense
infrared bands at 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 $\mu \rm m$ that have been normally
attributed to ionized PAHs so far. The present results suggest that strong
bands at 6.2 and 11.2 $\mu \rm m$ can arise from the same charge state of some
N-containing PAHs, arguing that there might be some N-abundant astronomical
regions where the 6.2 to 11.2 $\mu \rm m$ band ratio is not a direct indicator
of PAHs' ionization. PAHs with NH$_2$ and N inside the carbon structure show
the UIR band features characteristic to star-forming regions as well as
reflection nebulae (Class A), whereas PAHs with N at the periphery have similar
spectra to the UIR bands seen in planetary nebulae and post-AGB stars (Class
B). The presence of N atom at the periphery of a PAH may attract H or H$^{+}$
to form N-H and N-H$_2$ bonds, exhibiting features near 2.9--3.0 $\mu \rm m$,
which are not yet observationally detected. The absence of such features in the
observations constrains the contribution of NH and NH$_2$ substituted PAHs that
could be better tested with concentrated observations in this range. However,
PAHs with N without H either at the periphery or inside the carbon structure do
not have the abundance constraint due to the absence of 2.9--3.0 $\mu \rm m$
features and are relevant in terms of positions of the UIR bands. Extensive
theoretical and experimental studies are required to obtain deeper insight.

able to find solutions with certain structures from linear systems. To
generalize the concept of adaptive sampling to the SBP method, we show how the
progress, measured by Bregman distance, of single step depends directly on a
sketched loss function. Theoretically, we provide detailed global convergence
results for the SBP method with different adaptive sampling rules. At last, for

  approach",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic dynamic matching problems have recently drawn attention in the
stochastic-modeling community due to their numerous applications, ranging from
supply-chain management to kidney exchange programs. In this paper, we consider
a matching problem in which items of different classes arrive according to
independent Poisson processes. Unmatched items are stored in a queue, and
compatibility constraints are described by a simple graph on the classes, so
that two items can be matched if their classes are neighbors in the graph. We
analyze the efficiency of matching policies, not only in terms of system
stability, but also in terms of matching rates between different classes.
  Our results rely on the observation that, under any stable policy, the
matching rates satisfy a conservation equation that equates the arrival and
departure rates of each item class. Our main contributions are threefold. We
first introduce a mapping between the dimension of the solution set of this
conservation equation, the structure of the compatibility graph, and the
existence of a stable policy. In particular, this allows us to derive a
necessary and sufficient stability condition that is verifiable in polynomial
time. Secondly, we describe the convex polytope of non-negative solutions of
the conservation equation. When this polytope is reduced to a single point, we
give a closed-form expression of the solution; in general, we characterize the
vertices of this polytope using again the graph structure. Lastly, we study the
parts of the polytope that can be achieved by a stable policy. We show that
greedy policies are limited to the interior of the polytope, with a strict
inclusion in general. In contrast, non-greedy policies can reach any point of
the interior of this polytope, and also reach the boundary of the polytope
depending on a simple condition on the vertices.

$G$, denoted by $\delta^c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of colors
assigned to the edges incident to a vertex in $G$. In 2013, H. Li proved that
an edge-colored graph $G$ on $n$ vertices contains a rainbow triangle if
$\delta^c(G)\geq \frac{n+1}{2}$. In this paper, we obtain several estimates on
the number of rainbow triangles through one given vertex in $G$. As
consequences, we prove counting results for rainbow triangles in edge-colored
graphs. One main theorem states that the number of rainbow triangles in $G$ is
at least $\frac{1}{6}\delta^c(G)(2\delta^c(G)-n)n$, which is best possible by
considering the rainbow $k$-partite Tur\'an graph, where its order is divisible
by $k$. This means that there are $\Omega(n^2)$ rainbow triangles in $G$ if
$\delta^c(G)\geq \frac{n+1}{2}$, and $\Omega(n^3)$ rainbow triangles in $G$ if
$\delta^c(G)\geq cn$ when $c>\frac{1}{2}$. Both results are tight in sense of
the order of the magnitude. We also prove a counting version of a previous
theorem on rainbow triangles under a color neighborhood union condition due to
Broersma et al., and an asymptotically tight color degree condition forcing a
colored friendship subgraph $F_k$ (i.e., $k$ rainbow triangles sharing a common
vertex).

nonlinear modulation of solar cycle amplitudes. Tilt quenching (TQ) is a
negative feedback between cycle amplitude and the mean tilt angle of bipolar
active regions relative to the azimuthal direction; latitude quenching (LQ)
consists in a positive correlation between cycle amplitude and average
emergence latitude of active regions. Aims. Here we explore the relative
importance of and the determining factors behind the LQ and TQ effects.
Methods. The degree of nonlinearity induced by TQ, LQ and their combination is
systematically probed in a grid of surface flux transport (SFT) models. The
role of TQ and LQ is also explored in the successful 2x2D dynamo model
optimized to reproduce the statistical behaviour of real solar cycles. Results.
The relative importance of LQ vs TQ is found to correlate with the ratio u 0
/{\eta} in the SFT model grid, where u 0 is the meridional flow amplitude and
{\eta} is diffusivity. An analytical interpretation of this result is given,
further showing that the main underlying parameter is the dynamo effectivity
range {\lambda} R which in turn is determined by the ratio of equatorial flow
divergence to diffusivity. The relative importance of LQ vs TQ is shown to
scale as C 1 +C 2 /{\lambda} 2 R . The presence of a latitude quenching is
demonstrated in the 2x2D dynamo, contributing to the nonlinear modulation by an
amount comparable to TQ. For other dynamo and SFT models considered in the
literature the contribution of LQ to the modulation covers a broad range from
being insignificant to being the dominant form of feedback. On the other hand,
the contribution of a TQ effect (with the usually assumed amplitude) is never
negligible.

research domains growing in importance. Yet, the underlying concepts remain
somewhat elusive and lack generally agreed definitions. While recent
inspiration from social sciences has refocused the work on needs and
expectations of human recipients, the field still misses a concrete
conceptualisation. We take steps towards addressing this challenge by reviewing
the philosophical and social foundations of human explainability, which we then
translate into the technological realm. In particular, we scrutinise the notion
of algorithmic black boxes and the spectrum of understanding determined by
explanatory processes and explainees' background knowledge. This approach
allows us to define explainability as (logical) reasoning applied to
transparent insights (into, possibly black-box, predictive systems) interpreted
under background knowledge and placed within a specific context -- a process
that engenders understanding in a selected group of explainees. We then employ
this conceptualisation to revisit strategies for evaluating explainability as
well as the much disputed trade-off between transparency and predictive power,
including its implications for ante-hoc and post-hoc techniques along with
fairness and accountability established by explainability. We furthermore
discuss components of the machine learning workflow that may be in need of
interpretability, building on a range of ideas from human-centred
explainability, with a particular focus on explainees, contrastive statements
and explanatory processes. Our discussion reconciles and complements current
research to help better navigate open questions -- rather than attempting to
address any individual issue -- thus laying a solid foundation for a grounded
discussion and future progress of explainable artificial intelligence and
interpretable machine learning.

resembles a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator. Since these QSH layers are
simply stacked in the $\hat{x}$ direction and weakly coupled, three-dimensional
QSH effect can be expected in these distorted materials, such as insulating
compounds CeAs$_{1+x}$Se$_{1-y}$ and EuCdSb$_2$. Our detailed calculations show
that it hosts two twisted nodal wires without SOC [each consists of two
noncontractible time-reversal symmetry- and inversion symmetry-protected nodal
lines touching at a fourfold degenerate point], while with SOC it becomes a

a generalized spin Chern number $C_{s+}=2$ when there is a gap between two sets

still suffers from the well known cosmic curvature tension. In this paper, we
propose an improved method to determine the cosmic curvature, by using the
simulated data of binary neutron star mergers observed by the second generation
space-based DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO).
By applying the Hubble parameter observations of cosmic chronometers to the
DECIGO standard sirens, we explore different possibilities of making
measurements of the cosmic curvature referring to a distant past: one is to
reconstruct the Hubble parameters through the Gaussian process without the
influence of hypothetical models, and the other is deriving constraints on
$\Omega_K$ in the framework of non-flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model. It is
shown that in the improved method DECIGO could provide a reliable and stringent
constraint on the cosmic curvature ($\Omega_{K} = -0.007\pm0.016$), while we
could only expect the zero cosmic curvature to be established at the precision
of $\Delta \Omega_K=0.12$ in the second model-dependent method. Therefore, our
results indicate that in the framework of methodology proposed in this paper,
the increasing number of well-measured standard sirens in DECIGO could
significantly reduce the bias of estimations for cosmic curvature. Such
constraint is also comparable to the precision of Planck 2018 results with the
newest cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations ($\Delta \Omega_{K}
\approx 0.018$), based on the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model.

translation (NMT) systems. Recent adaptive training methods promote the output
of infrequent words by emphasizing their weights in the overall training
objectives. Despite the improved recall of low-frequency words, their
prediction precision is unexpectedly hindered by the adaptive objectives.
Inspired by the observation that low-frequency words form a more compact
embedding space, we tackle this challenge from a representation learning
perspective. Specifically, we propose a frequency-aware token-level contrastive
learning method, in which the hidden state of each decoding step is pushed away
from the counterparts of other target words, in a soft contrastive way based on
the corresponding word frequencies. We conduct experiments on widely used NIST
Chinese-English and WMT14 English-German translation tasks. Empirical results
show that our proposed methods can not only significantly improve the
translation quality but also enhance lexical diversity and optimize word
representation space. Further investigation reveals that, comparing with
related adaptive training strategies, the superiority of our method on
low-frequency word prediction lies in the robustness of token-level recall
across different frequencies without sacrificing precision.

fine structures are waveguides for several types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
oscillations, which can transport energy from the lower to upper layers of the
Sun. We provide a statistical study of 30 high frequency waves associated with
spicule type events. These high frequency oscillations have two components of
transverse motions: the plane of sky (POS) motion and the line of sight (LOS)
motion. We focus on single isolated spicules and track the POS using time
distance analysis and in the LOS direction using Doppler information. We use
moment analysis to find the relation between the two motions. The composition
of these two motions suggests that the wave has a helical structure. The
oscillations do not have phase differences between points along the structure.
This may be the result of the oscillation being a standing mode, or that
propagation is mostly in the perpendicular direction. There is evidence of fast
magnetoacoustic wave fronts propagating across these structures. To conclude,
we hypothesize that the compression and rarefaction of passing magnetoacoustic
waves may influence the appearance of spicule type events, not only by
contributing to moving them in and out of the wing of the spectral line but
also through the creation of density enhancements and an increase in opacity in
the Halpha line.

observed in multiple low-threshold dark matter detectors. Depending on the
target material, nuclear recoil events at these energies may cause lattice
defects, in which case a part of the true recoil energy is stored in the defect
and not observed in the phonon detector. If the threshold for defect creation
is sharp, this effect leads to a prominent feature in the observed recoil
spectrum. Electronic recoils at low energies do not create defects and
therefore the feature in the observed spectrum is not expected in that case. We
propose to use the sharp defect creation threshold of diamond to test if the
low energy events are due to nuclear recoils. Based on simulated data we expect
the nuclear recoil bump in the observed spectrum to be visible in diamond with
just ~0.1 gram days of exposure.

squeezing process of quantum states. The two-mode squeezed states consist of an
infinite number of entangled particles and then enhance the nonclassicality of
particles. There are two methods for estimating the degree of squeezing. One is
to employ instantaneous vacuum states, and the other is to adopt adiabatic
vacuum states. We analytically study the squeezing process of gravitons and
axions by using the two methods. We first consider a cosmological model of
inflation followed by instantaneous reheating leading to a radiation dominated
era. In the case of gravitons, we find no qualitatively difference in the
squeezing between the two methods. However, for the axions, it turns out that
the squeezing in the instantaneous vacuum increases as the mass increases while
the squeezing decreases in the adiabatic vacuum as the mass increases. We then
study the effect of non-instantaneous reheating on the the squeezing and show
that the squeezing is enhanced compared with the instantaneous reheating. We
also illustrate how the squeezed states enhance the violation of Bell
inequality and quantum noise of gravitons and axions.

Importantly, the selection of both the antibiotic and the cation may be done
depending on clinical needs. Herein, levofloxacin and Zn2+ ion, chosen owing to
both its antimicrobial and osteogenic capability, have been incorporated. This
dual biological role of Zn2+ could have and adjuvant effect thought destroying
the biofilm in combination with the antibiotic as well as aid to the repair and
regeneration of lost bone tissue associated to osteolysis during infection

Ag+ ions in a reference nanosystem. In vitro antimicrobial assays in planktonic

of levofloxacin and Zn2+, achieving an antimicrobial efficacy above 99%

cell cultures with MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts reveal the osteogenic capability of

quantum wells are examined for AC photoconductivity as a function of lattice
temperature and photoexcitation energy to determine the photoexcited charge
carrier transport. These samples previously exhibit an excitation energy onset
of a metastable regime in their short time charge carrier dynamics that
potentially improves their applicability for hot-carrier photovoltaic
applications. The transport results illustrate that the AC photoconductivity is
larger in the dynamic regime corresponding to the metastability as a result of
higher excitation photocarrier densities. In this excitation regime, the AC
photoconductivity is accompanied by slightly lower carrier mobility, arising
from the plasma-like nature of carriers scattered by Auger recombination.
Outside of this regime, higher mobility is observed as a result of a lower
excitation density that is more readily achievable by solar concentration.
Additionally, at ambient temperatures, more scattering events are accompanied
by slightly lower mobility, but the excitation dependence indicates that this
is accompanied by an ambipolar diffusion length that is greater than half a
micron. These transport properties are consistent with good quality inorganic
elemental and III-V semiconductor solar cells and far exceed those of novel
materials. The transport results complement the dynamics observed in type-II
InAs/AlAsSb and can guide the design of hot-carrier solar cells based on these

work, we predict for kagome AFMs with broken mirror symmetry a new coupling
mechanism between antiferromagnetic domain walls (DWs) and spin currents,
produced by the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We
microscopically derive the DMI's free energy contribution for the kagome AFMs.
Unlike ferromagnets and collinear AFMs, the DMI does not lead to terms linear
in the spatial derivatives but instead renormalizes the spin-wave stiffness and
anisotropy energies. Importantly, we show that the DMI induces a highly
nontrivial twisted DW profile that is controllable via two linearly independent
components of the spin accumulation. This texture manipulation mechanism goes
beyond the concept of staggered torques and implies a higher degree of
tunability for the current-driven DW motion compared to conventional
ferromagnets and collinear AFMs.

test techniques. Central to these techniques lies the hypothesis that
artificially seeded faults involve some form of realistic properties and thus
provide realistic experimental results. In an attempt to strengthen realism, a
recent line of research uses advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep
learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to seed faults that look like
(syntactically) real ones, implying that fault realism is related to syntactic
similarity. This raises the question of whether seeding syntactically similar
faults indeed results in semantically similar faults and more generally whether
syntactically dissimilar faults are far away (semantically) from the real ones.
We answer this question by employing 4 fault-seeding techniques (PiTest - a
popular mutation testing tool, IBIR - a tool with manually crafted fault
patterns, DeepMutation - a learning-based fault seeded framework and CodeBERT -
a novel mutation testing tool that use code embeddings) and demonstrate that
syntactic similarity does not reflect semantic similarity. We also show that

resembled by CodeBERT, PiTest, IBIR, and DeepMutation faults. We then perform
an objective comparison between the techniques and find that CodeBERT and
PiTest have similar fault detection capabilities that subsume IBIR and
DeepMutation, and that IBIR is the most cost-effective technique. Moreover, the
overall fault detection of PiTest, CodeBERT, IBIR, and DeepMutation was, on

the initial stage, coal mines had used not only males but also females as the
miners worked in the pits. The innovation of labor-saving technologies and the
renewal of traditional extraction methodology, however, induced the
institutional change through the revision of labor regulations on the female
miners in the early 1930s. This dramatically changed the mines as the place
where skilled males were the principal miners engaged in the underground works.
I investigate the impact of coal mining on the regional growth and assess how
the institutional change induced by the labor regulations affected its process.
By linking the location information of mines with registration- and
census-based statistics, I found that coal mines led to the remarkable
population growths. The labor regulations did not stagnate but accelerated the
local population growth as it had forced female miners to exist from labor
market and to form their families. The regulations prohibited risky underground
works by the female miners. This reduction in the occupational hazards also led

transition in CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and its distinction from other U-based heavy

different ground state properties based on an anisotropic ferromagnetic
Kondo-Heisenberg model. We employ an improved large-$N$ Schwinger boson
approach and predict a full phase diagram containing both a continuous
ferromagnetic quantum phase transition for large magnetic anisotropy and
first-order transitions for relatively small anisotropy. Our calculations
reveal three different ferromagnetic phases including a half-metallic spin
selective Kondo insulator with a constant magnetization. The Fermi surface
topologies are found to change abruptly between different phases, consistent
with that observed in UGe$_2$. At finite temperatures, we predict the
development of Kondo hybridization well above the ferromagnetic long-range
order and its relocalization near the phase transition, in good agreement with
band measurements in CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$. Our results highlight the importance of
magnetic anisotropy and provide a unified theory for understanding the

Standard Model can significantly alter matter effects in atmospheric neutrino
propagation through the Earth. In this paper, a search for deviations from the
prediction of the standard 3-flavour atmospheric neutrino oscillations using
the data taken by the ANTARES neutrino telescope is presented. Ten years of
atmospheric neutrino data collected from 2007 to 2016, with reconstructed
energies in the range from $\sim$16 GeV to $100$ GeV, have been analysed. A
log-likelihood ratio test of the dimensionless coefficients
$\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ and $\varepsilon_{\tau\tau} - \varepsilon_{\mu\mu}$
does not provide clear evidence of deviations from standard interactions. For
normal neutrino mass ordering, the combined fit of both coefficients yields a
value 1.7$\sigma$ away from the null result. However, the 68% and 95%
confidence level intervals for $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ and
$\varepsilon_{\tau\tau} - \varepsilon_{\mu\mu}$, respectively, contain the null
value. Best fit values, one standard deviation errors and bounds at the 90%
confidence level for these coefficients are given for both normal and inverted
mass orderings. The constraint on $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ is among the most
stringent to date and it further restrains the strength of possible
non-standard interactions in the $\mu - \tau$ sector.

to the agents' (i) visual representations, to analyze the effects on emergent

visual representations. Our analyses show that perceptual biases shape semantic
categorization and communicative content. Conversely, if the communication
protocol partitions object space along certain attributes, agents learn to
represent visual information about these attributes more accurately, and the
representations of communication partners align. Finally, an evolutionary
analysis suggests that visual representations may be shaped in part to
facilitate the communication of environmentally relevant distinctions. Aside
from accounting for co-adaptation effects between language and perception, our
results point out ways to modulate and improve visual representation learning

divided to the total number of papers (Ptop 10%/P). P represents the quantity,

tensor. Once the optimal unitary operators are determined, including the
location of qubits on which each unitary operator acts, elementary quantum
gates are assigned algebraically. With noiseless numerical simulations, we

However the
parameter space of this scenario has almost been ruled out by the X-ray

an extension to the minimal sterile neutrino DM model by introducing the
pseudo-Dirac sterile neutrino, which implies the existence of two nearly
degenerate Majorana states $\hat N_{1,2}^{}$, and a permutation symmetry. The
heavy state $\hat N_1$ is produced via the DW mechanism, and the light state
$\hat N_2$, which serves as the DM, is produced from the decay of $\hat N_1$ in
the early Universe. The X-ray constraint is avoided by the permutation
symmetry, which forbidden the two-body decay of the DM into active neutrinos
and photon. A promising signal of this scenario is the effective number of
neutrino species, which will be precisely measured in future experiments, such
as CMB stage IV. We further study the impact of this model on the cosmological
parameters. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for the Planck + BAO+R19 data
gives $H_0=69.2_{-0.59}^{+0.58}$, which may relieve the Hubble tension.

LBCM is that using this model all the follower vehicles in a platoon can adjust
their acceleration and deceleration to closely follow a constant desired time
gap to improve platoon operational efficiency while maintaining local and
string stability. We theoretically analyze the local stability of the
asymmetric LBCM using the condition for asymptotic stability of a linear
time-invariant system and prove the string stability of the asymmetric LBCM
using a space gap error attenuation approach. Then, we evaluate the efficacy of
the asymmetric LBCM by simulating a closely coupled cooperative adaptive cruise
control (CACC) platoon of fully automated trucks in various non-linear
acceleration and deceleration states. We choose automated truck platooning as a
case study since heavy-duty trucks experience higher delays and lags in the
powertrain system, and limited acceleration and deceleration capabilities than
passenger cars. To evaluate the platoon operational efficiency of the
asymmetric LBCM, we compare the performance of the asymmetric LBCM to a
baseline model, i.e., the symmetric LBCM, for different powertrain delays and
lags. Our analyses found that the asymmetric LBCM can handle any combined
powertrain delays and lags up to 0.6 sec while maintaining a constant desired
time gap during a stable platoon operation, whereas the symmetric LBCM fails to
ensure stable platoon operation as well as maintain a constant desired time gap
for any combined powertrain delays and lags over 0.2 sec. These findings
demonstrate the potential of the asymmetric LBCM in improving platoon
operational efficiency and stability of an automated truck platoon.

difficult but feasible task, if a few agents act as sensors revealing the time
at which they got hit by the diffusion. A main limitation of current source
detection algorithms is that they assume full knowledge of the contact network,
which is rarely the case, especially for epidemics, where the source is called
patient zero. Inspired by recent contact tracing algorithms, we propose a new
framework, which we call Source Detection via Contact Tracing Framework
(SDCTF). In the SDCTF, the source detection task starts at the time of the
first hospitalization, and initially we have no knowledge about the contact
network other than the identity of the first hospitalized agent. We may then
explore the network by contact queries, and obtain symptom onset times by test
queries in an adaptive way. We also assume that some of the agents may be
asymptomatic, and therefore cannot reveal their symptom onset time. Our goal is
to find patient zero with as few contact and test queries as possible.
  We propose two local search algorithms for the SDCTF: the LS algorithm is
more data-efficient, but can fail to find the true source if many asymptomatic
agents are present, whereas the LS+ algorithm is more robust to asymptomatic
agents. By simulations we show that both LS and LS+ outperform state of the art
adaptive and non-adaptive source detection algorithms adapted to the SDCTF,
even though these baseline algorithms have full access to the contact network.
Extending the theory of random exponential trees, we analytically approximate
the probability of success of the LS/ LS+ algorithms, and we show that our
analytic results match the simulations. Finally, we benchmark our algorithms on
the Data-driven COVID-19 Simulator developed by Lorch et al., which is the

  Perspective",,,"10.1145/3485447.3512185",,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance
on diverse real-world applications. To improve the model capacity, besides
designing aggregation operations, GNN topology design is also very important.
In general, there are two mainstream GNN topology design manners. The first one
is to stack aggregation operations to obtain the higher-level features but
easily got performance drop as the network goes deeper. Secondly, the multiple
aggregation operations are utilized in each layer which provides adequate and
independent feature extraction stage on local neighbors while are costly to
obtain the higher-level information. To enjoy the benefits while alleviating
the corresponding deficiencies of these two manners, we learn to design the
topology of GNNs in a novel feature fusion perspective which is dubbed
F$^2$GNN. To be specific, we provide a feature fusion perspective in designing
GNN topology and propose a novel framework to unify the existing topology
designs with feature selection and fusion strategies. Then we develop a neural
architecture search method on top of the unified framework which contains a set
of selection and fusion operations in the search space and an improved
differentiable search algorithm. The performance gains on eight real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of F$^2$GNN. We further conduct
experiments to show that F$^2$GNN can improve the model capacity while
alleviating the deficiencies of existing GNN topology design manners,
especially alleviating the over-smoothing problem, by utilizing different
levels of features adaptively.

ammonia (NY$_3$, Y= {H,D}), forming NY$_2^+$, Y and He as well as NY$^+$, Y$_2$
and He, and the corresponding product branching ratios have been measured at
low collision energies between 0 and $k_{\mathrm{B}}\cdot40$ K using a recently
developed merged-beam technique [Allmendinger {\it et al.}, ChemPhysChem {\bf
17}, 3596 (2016)]. To avoid heating of the ions by stray electric fields, the
reactions are observed within the large orbit of a highly excited Rydberg
electron. A beam of He Rydberg atoms was merged with a supersonic beam of
ammonia using a curved surface-electrode Rydberg-Stark deflector, which was
also used for adjusting the final velocity of the He Rydberg atoms, and thus
the collision energy ($E_{\rm coll}$). A collision-energy resolution of about
200 mK was reached at the lowest $E_{\rm coll}$ values. The reaction rate
coefficients exhibit a sharp increase at collision energies below $\sim
k_{\mathrm{B}}\cdot5$ K and pronounced deviations from Langevin-capture
behaviour. The experimental results are interpreted in terms of an adiabatic
capture model describing the rotational-state-dependent orientation of the
ammonia molecules by the electric field of the He$^+$ atom. The model
faithfully describes the experimental observations. The enhancement of the
reaction yields of both reactions observed at the lowest collision energies is
attributed to high-field-seeking states which experience linear Stark shifts at
low electric fields. Thermal capture rate constants are derived from the model
for the temperature range between 0 and 10~K relevant for astrochemistry.
Comparison of the calculated thermal capture rate coefficients with the
absolute reaction rates measured above 27 K by Marquette {\it et al.} (Chem.
Phys. Lett., 1985, {\bf 122}, 431) suggests that only 40\% of the close

molecular fragments or clusters can substantially simplify the construction of
the training sets. Here, we propose a method to determine structurally
converged molecular fragments providing reliable atomic forces based on an
analysis of the Hessian. The method, which serves as a locality test and allows
to estimate the importance of long-range interactions, is illustrated for a

$D_{3,1}$, the effects of initial interfaces on the coupled RTKHI are examined
in detail. The research is focused on two aspects: (i) the main mechanism in
the early stage of the RTKHI, (ii) the transition point from KHI-like to
RTI-like for the case where the KHI dominates at earlier time and the RTI

reasons, including the study of linear ordinary differential equations. Taking
Frenet frames obtains corresponding curves $\Gamma$ in the group $Spin_{n+1}$;
$\Pi: Spin_{n+1} \to Flag_{n+1}$ is the universal cover of the space of flags.
Determining the homotopy type of spaces of such curves $\Gamma$ with prescribed
initial and final points appears to be a hard problem. We may focus on $L_n$,
the space of locally convex curves $\Gamma: [0,1] \to Spin_{n+1}$ with
$\Gamma(0) = 1$, $\Pi(\Gamma(1)) = \Pi(1)$. Convex curves form a contractible
connected component of $L_n$; there are $2^{n+1}$ other components, one for
each endpoint. The homotopy type of $L_n$ has so far been determined only for
$n=2$. This paper is a step towards solving the problem for larger values of
$n$.
  The itinerary of $\Gamma$ belongs to $W_n$, the set of finite words in the
alphabet $S_{n+1} \setminus \{e\}$. The itinerary of a curve lists the non open
Bruhat cells crossed. Itineraries stratify the space $L_n$. We construct a CW
complex $D_n$ which is a kind of dual of $L_n$ under this stratification: the
construction is similar to Poincar\'e duality. The CW complex $D_n$ is homotopy
equivalent to $L_n$. The cells of $D_n$ are naturally labeled by words in
$W_n$; $D_n$ is locally finite. Explicit glueing instructions are described for
lower dimensions.
  We describe an open subset $Y_n \subset L_n$, a union of strata of $L_n$. In
each non convex component of $L_n$, the intersection with $Y_n$ is connected
and dense. Most connected components of $L_n$ are contained in $Y_n$. For $n >
3$, in the other components the complement of $Y_n$ has codimension at least
$2$. The set $Y_n$ is homotopy equivalent to the disjoint union of $2^{n+1}$
copies of $\Omega Spin_{n+1}$. For all $n \ge 2$, all connected components of
$L_n$ are simply connected.

the query complexity in deciding a property of black-box unitaries with respect

all tasks explicitly found so far require unitaries that either act on
unbounded dimensional quantum systems in the asymptotic limit (the limiting

only a few unitaries. Here we introduce tasks (1) for which there is a provable
computational advantage of a quantum-controlled ordering of gates in the
asymptotic case and (2) that require only qubit gates and are therefore
suitable to demonstrate this advantage experimentally. We study their solutions
with the quantum-$n$-switch and within the quantum circuit model and find that
while the $n$-switch requires to call each gate only once, a causal algorithm
has to call at least $2n-1$ gates. Furthermore, the best known solution with a

magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the brain requires accurate models of the
stimulation coils. Reconstructing models from the measured magnetic fields of
coils so far worked only for flat coil geometries and required data of their
full magnetic field distribution.
  Objective: To reconstruct models of coils with arbitrary winding geometries
from spatially incomplete magnetic field measurements.
  Methods: Dipole approximation via minimum norm estimation with a cross
validation procedure simultaneously assessing predictability and
reproducibility of the field approximation. The methods were validated on both
simulated and acquired magnetic flux density data. Furthermore, reconstruction
of coil models from sparsely sampled data is investigated and a procedure for
obtaining sparse dipole coil models based on orthogonal matching pursuit is
suggested.
  Results: Given that measured data from regions around the coil are available,
the magnetic vector potential can accurately be represented by fitted dipole
models even from sparsely sampled data. Considerable sparsification of dipole
models is possible while retaining accurate representation of the field also

Standard techniques for Hamiltonian learning require careful design of queries

the standard quantum limit. With the goal of efficiently and accurately
estimating the Hamiltonian parameters within learning error $\epsilon$ through
minimal queries, we introduce an active learner that is given an initial set of

generate new training data. We formally specify and experimentally assess the
performance of this Hamiltonian active learning (HAL) algorithm for learning
the six parameters of a two-qubit cross-resonance Hamiltonian on four different
superconducting IBM Quantum devices. Compared with standard techniques for the
same problem and a specified learning error, HAL achieves up to a $99.8\%$
reduction in queries required, and a $99.1\%$ reduction over the comparable
non-adaptive learning algorithm. Moreover, with access to prior information on
a subset of Hamiltonian parameters and given the ability to select queries with
linearly (or exponentially) longer system interaction times during learning,
HAL can exceed the standard quantum limit and achieve Heisenberg (or

increases to 700, the constraint precision of $H_0$ will exceed that of the

from the chargino-sneutrino loops, but the muon g-2 anomaly can also constrain
the mass of smuon seriously because of the mass-degenerate relation between
smuon and muon sneutrino. To interpret the muon g-2 anomaly at $1\sigma$

the direct searches with low mass, e.g., 300 GeV. (iii) When smuon and
$\tilde{\chi}^0_1$ are mass-degenerate, the smuon can be as light as 200 GeV,

universal integrable deformation inducing (via a unique map) all other

Many studies have considered model selection methods. As is well-known,

predictive performance due to model selection uncertainties. This paper
advocates model averaging as an alternative approach, where estimates obtained
from different models are combined in a weighted average. We propose a model
weighting scheme and provide the theoretical underpinning for the proposed

of the functional renormalization group (FRG). The bosonic part of the

adaptive, anytime and scale-free online learning algorithms. Scale-free regret
bounds must scale linearly with the maximum loss, both toward large losses and
toward very small losses. Adaptive regret bounds demonstrate that an algorithm
can take advantage of easy data and potentially have constant regret. We seek
to develop fast algorithms that depend on as few parameters as possible, in
particular they should be anytime and thus not depend on the time horizon. Our
first and main tool, isotuning, is a generalization of the idea of balancing
the trade-off of the regret. We develop a set of tools to design and analyze
such learning rates easily and show that they adapts automatically to the rate
of the regret (whether constant, $O(\log T)$, $O(\sqrt{T})$, etc.) within a
factor 2 of the optimal learning rate in hindsight for the same observed
quantities. The second tool is an online correction, which allows us to obtain
centered bounds for many algorithms, to prevent the regret bounds from being
vacuous when the domain is overly large or only partially constrained. The last
tool, null updates, prevents the algorithm from performing overly large
updates, which could result in unbounded regret, or even invalid updates. We
develop a general theory using these tools and apply it to several standard
algorithms. In particular, we (almost entirely) restore the adaptivity to small
losses of FTRL for unbounded domains, design and prove scale-free adaptive
guarantees for a variant of Mirror Descent (at least when the Bregman

computational problems if they can be operated at scale with long coherence
times and high fidelity logic. Neutral atom hyperfine qubits provide inherent
scalability due to their identical characteristics, long coherence times, and
ability to be trapped in dense multi-dimensional arrays\cite{Saffman2010}.
Combined with the strong entangling interactions provided by Rydberg
states\cite{Jaksch2000,Gaetan2009,Urban2009}, all the necessary characteristics
for quantum computation are available. Here we demonstrate several quantum
algorithms on a programmable gate model neutral atom quantum computer in an
architecture based on individual addressing of single atoms with tightly
focused optical beams scanned across a two-dimensional array of qubits.
Preparation of entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)

a chemistry problem\cite{Aspuru-Guzik2005}, and the Quantum Approximate

demonstrated. These results highlight the emergent capability of neutral atom
qubit arrays for universal, programmable quantum computation, as well as
preparation of non-classical states of use for quantum enhanced sensing.

statistics and machine learning. To achieve computationally feasible inference
for large datasets, a popular approach is the Vecchia approximation, which is
an ordered conditional approximation of the data vector that implies a sparse
Cholesky factor of the precision matrix. The ordering and sparsity pattern are
typically determined based on Euclidean distance of the inputs or locations
corresponding to the data points. Here, we propose instead to use a
correlation-based distance metric, which implicitly applies the Vecchia
approximation in a suitable transformed input space. The correlation-based
algorithm can be carried out in quasilinear time in the size of the dataset,
and so it can be applied even for iterative inference on unknown parameters in
the correlation structure. The correlation-based approach has two advantages
for complex settings: It can result in more accurate approximations, and it
offers a simple, automatic strategy that can be applied to any covariance, even
when Euclidean distance is not applicable. We demonstrate these advantages in
several settings, including anisotropic, nonstationary, multivariate, and
spatio-temporal processes. We also illustrate our method on multivariate
spatio-temporal temperature fields produced by a regional climate model.

monotonically in time in the early-time region, and at late times these

near-field property of XL-MIMO systems becomes dominant. Unlike the classical
far-field line-of-sight (LoS) channel with only one available data stream, the
significantly increased degrees of freedom (DoFs) are available in the
near-field LoS channel. However, limited by the small number of radio frequency
(RF) chains, the existing hybrid precoding architecture widely used for 5G is
not able to fully exploit the extra DoFs in the near-field region. In this
paper, the available DoFs and the capacity of the near-field LoS channel are
theoretically analyzed at first. Then, to exploit the near-field effect as a
new possibility for capacity improvement, the distance-aware precoding (DAP)
scheme is proposed. We develop the DAP architecture, where a dedicated
selection circuit is inserted to connect phase shifters and RF chains.
Moreover, each RF chain can be flexibly configured to active or inactive
according to the distance-related DoFs in the proposed DAP architecture. Based
on the developed DAP architecture, a DAP algorithm is proposed to optimize the
number of activated RF chains and precoding matrices to match the increased
DoFs in the near-field region. Finally, simulation results verify that, the
proposed DAP scheme can efficiently utilize the extra DoFs in the near-field
region to improve the spectrum efficiency and the energy efficiency as well.

recovery from an RGB counterpart. Due to the one-to-many nature of the SSR
problem, a single RGB image can be reprojected to many HSIs. The key to tackle
this ill-posed problem is to plug into multi-source prior information such as
the natural spatial context-prior of RGB images, deep feature-prior or inherent
statistical-prior of HSIs, etc., so as to effectively alleviate the degree of
ill-posedness. However, most current approaches only consider the general and
limited priors in their customized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which
leads to the inability to guarantee the confidence and fidelity of
reconstructed spectra. In this paper, we propose a novel holistic
prior-embedded relation network (HPRN) to integrate comprehensive priors to
regularize and optimize the solution space of SSR. Basically, the core
framework is delicately assembled by several multi-residual relation blocks
(MRBs) that fully facilitate the transmission and utilization of the
low-frequency content prior of RGBs. Innovatively, the semantic prior of RGB
inputs is introduced to mark category attributes, and a semantic-driven spatial
relation module (SSRM) is invented to perform the feature aggregation of
clustered similar range for refining recovered characteristics. Additionally,
we develop a transformer-based channel relation module (TCRM), which breaks the
habit of employing scalars as the descriptors of channel-wise relations in the
previous deep feature-prior, and replaces them with certain vectors to make the
mapping function more robust and smoother. In order to maintain the
mathematical correlation and spectral consistency between hyperspectral bands,
the second-order prior constraints (SOPC) are incorporated into the loss
function to guide the HSI reconstruction.

coadjoint orbit when central charges are real and non-zero. The ensuing
BMS-Schwarzian action has no saddle points, and only coincides with the
boundary action functional of flat JT gravity up to a crucial dilatonic
zero-mode that ensures the existence of a well-defined bulk variational
principle. We evaluate the corresponding gravitational partition function,
which turns out to be one-loop exact precisely thanks to the presence of such a
zero-mode.

application of smart contracts in a variety of contexts such as decentralized
finance, supply chain management, and identity management. However, a critical
stumbling block to the further adoption of smart contracts is their security. A
particularly widespread class of security vulnerabilities that afflicts
Ethereum smart contracts is the gas limit denial of service(DoS) on a contract
via unbounded operations. These vulnerabilities result in a failed transaction
with an out-of-gas error and are often present in contracts containing loops
whose bounds are affected by end-user input. Note that such vulnerabilities
differ from gas limit DoS on the network via block stuffing. Therefore, we
present Gas Gauge, a tool aimed at detecting Out-of-Gas DoS vulnerabilities in
Ethereum smart contracts. Gas Gauge consists of three major components: the
Detection, Identification, and Correction Phases. The Detection Phase consists
of an accurate static analysis approach that finds and summarizes all the loops
in a smart contract. The Identification Phase uses a white-box fuzzing approach
to generate a set of inputs that causes the contract to run out of gas. The
Correction Phase uses static analysis and run-time verification to predict the
maximum loop bounds consistent with allowable gas usage and suggest appropriate
repairs to the user of the tool. Each part of the tool can be used separately
for different purposes or all together to detect, identify and help repair the
contracts vulnerable to Out-of-Gas DoS vulnerabilities. Gas Gauge was tested on
1,000 real-world solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet. The
results were compared to seven state-of-the-art static and symbolic tools, and
it was empirically demonstrated that Gas Gauge is far more effective than
competing state-of-the-art tools.

in recent years. However, we observe that, in the process of node encoding,
existing methods suffer from representation collapse which tends to map all
data into the same representation. Consequently, the discriminative capability
of the node representation is limited, leading to unsatisfied clustering
performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised deep
graph clustering method termed Dual Correlation Reduction Network (DCRN) by
reducing information correlation in a dual manner. Specifically, in our method,
we first design a siamese network to encode samples. Then by forcing the
cross-view sample correlation matrix and cross-view feature correlation matrix
to approximate two identity matrices, respectively, we reduce the information
correlation in the dual-level, thus improving the discriminative capability of
the resulting features. Moreover, in order to alleviate representation collapse
caused by over-smoothing in GCN, we introduce a propagation regularization term
to enable the network to gain long-distance information with the shallow
network structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCRN against the existing
state-of-the-art methods.

deformations and subsequent cell crawling poses many interdisciplinary
scientific challenges. Several mathematical approaches have been proposed to
model the coupling of both processes, where one of the most successful methods
relies on a phase field that encodes the morphology of the cell, together with
the integration of partial differential equations that account for the
polarization mechanism inside the cell domain as defined by the phase field.
This approach has been previously employed to model the motion of single cells
of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a widely used model organism to
study actin-driven motility and chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells. Besides single
cell motility, Dictyostelium discoideum is also well-known for its collective
behavior. Here, we extend the previously introduced model for single cell
motility to describe the collective motion of large populations of interacting
amoebae by including repulsive interactions between the cells. We performed
numerical simulations of this model, first characterizing the motion of single
cells in terms of their polarity and velocity vectors. We then systematically
studied the collisions between two cells that provided the basic interaction
scenarios also observed in larger ensembles of interacting amoebae. Finally,
the relevance of the cell density was analyzed, revealing a systematic decrease
of the motility with density, associated with the formation of transient cell
clusters that emerge in this system. This model is a prototypical active matter
system for the investigation of the emergent collective dynamics of deformable,
self-driven cells with a highly complex, nonlinear coupling of cell shape
deformations, self-propulsion and repulsive cell-cell interactions.

LGIs does not provide the necessary and sufficient for macrorealism. A suitably
formulated set of no-signaling in time (NSIT) conditions along with the
arrow-of-time (AOT) condition provides the same. In this paper, we study two
formulations in the three-time LG scenario, viz., the standard LGIs and the
recently formulated variant of LGIs when the system evolves under
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian. We first demonstrate that the quantum
violations of both forms of LGIs exceed their respective L\""uders bounds and
can even reach their algebraic maximum. We further show that for the case of
standard LGI, the violation of L\""uders bound can be obtained when both NSIT
and AOT conditions are violated. Interestingly, for the case of a variant of
LGI, for suitable choices of relevant parameters, the quantum violation can
even be obtained when only the AOT is violated but all NSIT conditions are

action-perception loop to obtain an observer-independent description of the
world? Here we model scientists engaged in the practice of science and argue
that to achieve such a feat scientists must describe the world with the tools
of quantum theory. This aligns with growing evidence suggesting that in quantum
theory facts are relative. We argue that embodiment, as traditionally
understood, can entail imaginary-time quantum dynamics. However, we argue that
an embodied scientist interacting with an experimental system must be described
from the perspective of another scientist, which is ignored in traditional
approaches to embodied cognition. To describe the world without any reference
to external observers we take two steps. First, we assume that observers play
complementary roles as both objects experienced by other observers and
""subjects"" that experience other objects -- here the word ""subject"" is used in
a strict technical sense as the opposite of object. Second, like two mirrors
reflecting each other as well as another object, we have to assume that two
(sets of) observers mutually observe each other as well as the experimental
system. This entails two coupled imaginary-time quantum dynamics that can be
written as the imaginary and real parts of a genuine, real-time quantum
dynamics. We discuss some potential implications of our work.

condition - T-wave Alternans (TWA) as a result of Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder, or PTSD - and significantly boost performance on a small database of
rare individuals.
  Approach: Using a previously validated artificial ECG model, we generated
180,000 artificial ECGs with or without significant TWA, with varying heart
rate, breathing rate, TWA amplitude, and ECG morphology. A DNN, trained on over
70,000 patients to classify 25 different rhythms, was modified the output layer
to a binary class (TWA or no-TWA, or equivalently, PTSD or no-PTSD), and
transfer learning was performed on the artificial ECG. In a final transfer
learning step, the DNN was trained and cross-validated on ECG from 12 PTSD and
24 controls for all combinations of using the three databases.
  Main results: The best performing approach (AUROC = 0.77, Accuracy = 0.72,
F1-score = 0.64) was found by performing both transfer learning steps, using
the pre-trained arrhythmia DNN, the artificial data and the real PTSD-related
ECG data. Removing the artificial data from training led to the largest drop in
performance. Removing the arrhythmia data from training provided a modest, but
significant, drop in performance. The final model showed no significant drop in
performance on the artificial data, indicating no overfitting.
  Significance: In healthcare, it is common to only have a small collection of
high-quality data and labels, or a larger database with much lower quality (and
less relevant) labels. The paradigm presented here, involving model-based
performance boosting, provides a solution through transfer learning on a large
realistic artificial database, and a partially relevant real database.

splitting reduces the variance of rare event probability estimators by

systems where the initial conditions of the offspring realizations need to be
modified. Typically, a random perturbation is applied to the offspring to
differentiate their trajectory from the parent realization. However, this
random perturbation strategy may be effective for some systems while failing

reduction a critical component of data-driven methods. Datasets are growing in
two directions: the number of data points and their dimensionality. Whereas
dimension reduction typically aims at describing each data sample on
lower-dimensional space, the focus here is on reducing the number of data
points. A strategy is proposed to select data points such that they uniformly
span the phase-space of the data. The algorithm proposed relies on estimating
the probability map of the data and using it to construct an acceptance
probability. An iterative method is used to accurately estimate the probability
of the rare data points when only a small subset of the dataset is used to
construct the probability map. Instead of binning the phase-space to estimate
the probability map, its functional form is approximated with a normalizing
flow. Therefore, the method naturally extends to high-dimensional datasets. The
proposed framework is demonstrated as a viable pathway to enable data-efficient
machine learning when abundant data is available. An implementation of the
method is available in a companion repository
(https://github.com/NREL/Phase-space-sampling).

harvesting solutions are needed. The first step towards this development is to
determine the harvestable energy in real indoor environ-ments. But the
harvestable energy varying over time with nature (spectra) and intensity of the
light multi-sources, lighting data must be collected for sufficiently long
periods. Besides, for a real implementation on-site, studies must be able to be
carried out simultaneously in several places to determine locations with the
highest energy harvesting potential. In this context, this manuscript presents
a very low-cost prototype based on commercial photodiodes (rather than very
expensive spectrometers), which measures only a very rudimentary number of
spectral data. Thanks to a classification supervised machine learning from
Matlab, in which an algorithm learns to classify new observations, and thanks
to a simple principle of the superposition approximation model de-veloped for
flexible GaAs solar cells, our harvestable energy estimation error is less than
5 percents after more than 2 weeks of observation. To measure this error, the
data collected leading to an estimate of the harvestable energy is compared to
what has been experimentally harvested in a real IoT system Li-ion battery and
compared to what has been estimated using an expensive spectrometer during the
same period. Our prototype should allow the development and the massive
deploy-ment of a new generation of low cost indoor light energy harvesting
sensors for future reliable indoor energy harvesters.

cluster formation assumption that cluster centers are often surrounded by data
points with lower local density and far away from other data points with higher
local density. However, this assumption suffers from one limitation that it is
often problematic when identifying clusters with lower density because they
might be easily merged into other clusters with higher density. As a result,
DPC may not be able to identify clusters with variational density. To address
this issue, we propose a variational density peak clustering (VDPC) algorithm,
which is designed to systematically and autonomously perform the clustering
task on datasets with various types of density distributions. Specifically, we
first propose a novel method to identify the representatives among all data
points and construct initial clusters based on the identified representatives
for further analysis of the clusters' property. Furthermore, we divide all data
points into different levels according to their local density and propose a
unified clustering framework by combining the advantages of both DPC and
DBSCAN. Thus, all the identified initial clusters spreading across different
density levels are systematically processed to form the final clusters. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VDPC algorithm, we conduct extensive
experiments using 20 datasets including eight synthetic, six real-world and six
image datasets. The experimental results show that VDPC outperforms two
classical algorithms (i.e., DPC and DBSCAN) and four state-of-the-art extended

non-conventional electrode configurations, there is a need for automated
algorithms that can perform sleep staging on configurations with small amounts
of labeled data. Transfer learning has the ability to adapt neural network
weights from a source modality (e.g. standard electrode configuration) to a new
target modality (e.g. non-conventional electrode configuration). Methods: We
propose feature matching, a new transfer learning strategy as an alternative to
the commonly used finetuning approach. This method consists of training a model
with larger amounts of data from the source modality and few paired samples of
source and target modality. For those paired samples, the model extracts
features of the target modality, matching these to the features from the
corresponding samples of the source modality. Results: We compare feature
matching to finetuning for three different target domains, with two different
neural network architectures, and with varying amounts of training data.
Particularly on small cohorts (i.e. 2 - 5 labeled recordings in the
non-conventional recording setting), feature matching systematically
outperforms finetuning with mean relative differences in accuracy ranging from
0.4% to 4.7% for the different scenarios and datasets. Conclusion: Our findings
suggest that feature matching outperforms finetuning as a transfer learning
approach, especially in very low data regimes. Significance: As such, we
conclude that feature matching is a promising new method for wearable sleep
staging with novel devices.

gravitational system cannot be decribed by the standard statistical mechanics.
In this article we apply Tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics to
investigate CMB spectrum and related cosmological processes. Based on recent
observational data we find that the nonextensive statistical mechanics can
modify the values of related physical quantites. Since the value of physical
quantites have changed, some processes, such as recombination, can be affected.
We have investigated the anisotropy of the CMB for two effects: the dipole
anisotropy of CMB and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We find that the dipole
anisotropy of CMB cannot be modified by the nonextensive statistical mechanics.
However, the standard result of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect should be
modified by nonextensive statistical mechanics. In principle, future work can
distinguish these effects.

  Aerial Data Delivery",,,,,"cs.GT cs.AI cs.LG cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A successful deployment of drones provides an ideal solution for surveillance
systems. Using drones for surveillance can provide access to areas that may be
difficult or impossible to reach by humans or in-land vehicles gathering images
or video recordings of a specific target in their coverage. Therefore, we
introduces a data delivery drone to transfer collected surveillance data in
harsh communication conditions. This paper proposes a Myerson auction-based
asynchronous data delivery in an aerial distributed data platform in
surveillance systems taking battery limitation and long flight constraints into
account. In this paper, multiple delivery drones compete to offer data transfer
to a single fixed-location surveillance drone. Our proposed Myerson
auction-based algorithm, which uses the truthful second-price auction (SPA) as
a baseline, is to maximize the seller's revenue while meeting several desirable
properties, i.e., individual rationality and incentive compatibility while
pursuing truthful operations. On top of these SPA-based operations, a deep
learning-based framework is additionally designed for delivery performance
improvements.

perturbations, i.e., inputs which are maliciously crafted through perturbations
to induce wrong predictions. Furthermore, such attacks are impossible to
eliminate, i.e., the adversarial perturbation is still possible after applying
mitigation methods such as adversarial training. Multiple approaches have been
developed to detect and reject such adversarial inputs, mostly in the image
domain. Rejecting suspicious inputs however may not be always feasible or
ideal. First, normal inputs may be rejected due to false alarms generated by
the detection algorithm. Second, denial-of-service attacks may be conducted by
feeding such systems with adversarial inputs. To address the gap, in this work,
we propose an approach to automatically repair adversarial texts at runtime.
Given a text which is suspected to be adversarial, we novelly apply multiple
adversarial perturbation methods in a positive way to identify a repair, i.e.,
a slightly mutated but semantically equivalent text that the neural network
correctly classifies. Our approach has been experimented with multiple models
trained for natural language processing tasks and the results show that our
approach is effective, i.e., it successfully repairs about 80\% of the
adversarial texts. Furthermore, depending on the applied perturbation method,
an adversarial text could be repaired in as short as one second on average.

contrast to many other state of the art ML methods typically produces highly
interpretable and reusable models. However, many ILP systems lack the ability
to naturally learn from any noisy or partially misclassified training data. We
introduce the relaxed learning from failures approach to ILP, a noise handling
modification of the previously introduced learning from failures (LFF) approach
which is incapable of handling noise. We additionally introduce the novel Noisy
Popper ILP system which implements this relaxed approach and is a modification
of the existing Popper system. Like Popper, Noisy Popper takes a
generate-test-constrain loop to search its hypothesis space wherein failed
hypotheses are used to construct hypothesis constraints. These constraints are
used to prune the hypothesis space, making the hypothesis search more
efficient. However, in the relaxed setting, constraints are generated in a more
lax fashion as to avoid allowing noisy training data to lead to hypothesis
constraints which prune optimal hypotheses. Constraints unique to the relaxed
setting are generated via hypothesis comparison. Additional constraints are
generated by weighing the accuracy of hypotheses against their sizes to avoid
overfitting through an application of the minimum description length. We
support this new setting through theoretical proofs as well as experimental
results which suggest that Noisy Popper improves the noise handling
capabilities of Popper but at the cost of overall runtime efficiency.

germanium films with the thickness up to 200 nm grown from molecular beams on

changes of the intensity of the N$-$H and Si$-$N absorption bands have been
observed in the IR absorbance spectra as a result of the deposition of the
silicon and germanium films. The thicker was the deposited film, the more
considerable were the decrease of N$-$H absorption band intensity and the
increase in that of the Si$-$N band. This tendency has been observed during the
growth of both amorphous and polycrystalline Si or Ge films. The reduction of
IR absorption at the band assigned to the N$-$H bond vibration is explained by
breaking of these bonds followed by the diffusion of the hydrogen atoms from
the Si$_3$N$_4$ layer into the growing film of silicon or germanium. The effect
of the deposited film thickness on the diffusion of hydrogen is discussed
within a model of the diffusion of hydrogen atoms controlled by the difference
in chemical potentials of hydrogen atoms in the dielectric Si$_3$N$_4$ layer
and the growing silicon or germanium film. Hydrogen atoms escape from the
Si$_3$N$_4$ layer only during the deposition of a Si or Ge film when its
thickness gradually grows. The interruption of the film growth stops the
migration of hydrogen atoms into the film because of the decline in the
chemical potential difference.

COMET and PRISM, the rate of charged current interaction of decay neutrinos
with nuclear protons is also non-negligible. In this work, we perform a

electron antineutrinos with Al target protons in the COMET setup. About
