our model, we design a novel strategy for event argument combination together
with a non-autoregressive decoding algorithm via pruned complete graphs, which
are constructed under the guidance of the automatically selected pseudo
triggers. Compared to the previous systems, our system achieves competitive
results with 19.8\% of parameters and much lower resource consumption, taking
only 3.8\% GPU hours for training and up to 8.5 times faster for inference.
Besides, our model shows superior compatibility for the datasets with (or
without) triggers and the pseudo triggers can be the supplements for annotated
triggers to make further improvements. Codes are available at

spectral discretization as systematically convergent approximations. This
enables efficient and adaptive algorithms that solve the equations of DFT with
no additional modeling, and up to desired accuracy, for very large systems,
with linear and sublinear scaling. Various approaches based on such

and helps in assessing heart function. There are distinct ECG patterns

is currently one of the most commonly employed deep learning algorithms for ECG
processing. However, deep learning models require many hyperparameters to tune.
Selecting an optimal or best hyperparameter for the convolutional neural
network algorithm is a highly challenging task. Often, we end up tuning the
model manually with different possible ranges of values until a best fit model
is obtained. Automatic hyperparameters tuning using Bayesian optimisation (BO)
and evolutionary algorithms can provide an effective solution to current
labour-intensive manual configuration approaches. In this paper, we propose to
optimise the Residual one Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model
(R-1D-CNN) at two levels. At the first level, a residual convolutional layer
and one-dimensional convolutional neural layers are trained to learn
patient-specific ECG features over which multilayer perceptron layers can learn
to produce the final class vectors of each input. This level is manual and aims
to lower the search space. The second level is automatic and based on our
proposed BO-based algorithm. Our proposed optimised R-1D-CNN architecture is
evaluated on two publicly available ECG Datasets. Comparative experimental
results demonstrate that our BO-based algorithm achieves an optimal rate of
99.95%, while the baseline model achieves 99.70% for the MIT-BIH database.
Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture fine-tuned
with BO achieves a higher accuracy than the other proposed architectures. Our
optimised architecture achieves excellent results compared to previous works on
benchmark datasets.

threshold of 50%. In contrast to the rotated surface code and the XZZX code,
which have code distance $d^2$ only for pure $Y$ noise, here the code distance
is $2d^2$ for both pure $Z$ and pure $Y$ noise. Thresholds for noise with
finite $Z$ bias are similar to the XZZX code, but with markedly lower
sub-threshold logical failure rates. The code possesses distinctive syndrome
properties with unidirectional pairs of plaquette defects along the three
directions of the triangular lattice for isolated errors, which may be useful
for efficient matching-based or other approximate decoding.

System evolution. Evidence for these collisions is brought to Earth by
meteorites, which can preserve impact-reset radioisotope mineral ages. However,
as meteorites often preserve numerous mineral ages, their interpretation is
controversial. Here, we combine analysis of phosphate U-Pb ages and mineral
microtextures to construct a collision history for the highly shocked
Chelyabinsk meteorite. We show that phosphate U-Pb ages in the meteorite are
independent of thermal history at macro-to-microscales, correlating instead
with phosphate microtexture. Isotopic data from pristine phosphate domains is
largely concordant, whereas fracture-damaged domains universally display
discordance. Combining both populations best constrains upper (4,473 +/- 11 Ma)
and lower intercept (-9 +/- 55 Ma, i.e., within error of the present day) U-Pb
ages for Chelyabinsk phosphates. We conclude that all phosphate U-Pb ages were
completely reset during an ancient high energy collision. Fracture-damaged
phosphate domains experienced further Pb-loss during mild collisional heating
in the geologically recent past, and must be targeted to properly constrain a
lower intercept age. Targeting textural sub-populations of phosphate grains can
significantly improve the calculation and interpretation of U-Pb ages,
permitting more robust reconstruction of both ancient and recent asteroidal
collision histories.

CertiStr, a certified implementation of a string constraint solver for the
theory of strings with concatenation and regular constraints. CertiStr aims to
solve string constraints using a forward-propagation algorithm based on
symbolic representations of regular constraints as symbolic automata, which
returns three results: sat, unsat, and unknown, and is guaranteed to terminate
for the string constraints whose concatenation dependencies are acyclic. The
implementation has been developed and proven correct in Isabelle/HOL, through

theorem, in reference to the orbital motion of a small body (satellite or space

perturbations due to Sun and Moon. We discuss how to bring the Hamiltonian into
a form suitable for the implementation of the Nekhoroshev theorem in the

suitable expansion around reference values for the orbit's eccentricity and
inclination, and iii) a preliminary normalization allowing to eliminate
particular terms whose existence is due to the non-zero inclination of the
invariant plane of secular motions known as the `Laplace plane'. After bringing
the Hamiltonian to a suitable form, we examine the domain of applicability of
the theorem in the action space, translating the result in the space of
physical elements. We find that the necessary conditions for the theorem to
hold are fulfilled in some non-zero measure domains in the eccentricity and
inclination plane (e, i) for a body's orbital altitude (semi-major axis) up to
about 20000 km. For altitudes around 11000 km we obtain stability times of the
order of several thousands of years in domains covering nearly all
eccentricities and inclinations of interest in applications of the satellite
problem, except for narrow zones around some so-called `inclination-dependent'
resonances. On the other hand, the domains of Nekhoroshev stability recovered
by the present method shrink in size as the semi-major axis a increases (and
the corresponding Nekhoroshev times reduce to hundreds of years), while the
stability domains practically all vanish for a > 20000 km.

Therefore, it is introduced in speech enhancement to improve the speech

cost issue in Transformer with self-attention, the axial attention is the
option i.e., to split a 2D attention into two 1D attentions. Inspired by the
axial attention, in the proposed method we calculate the attention map along
both time- and frequency-axis to generate time and frequency sub-attention
maps. Moreover, different from the axial attention, the proposed method
provides two parallel multi-head attentions for time- and frequency-axis.
Furthermore, it is proven in the literature that the lower frequency-band in
speech, generally, contains more desired information than the higher
frequency-band, in a noise mixture. Therefore, the frequency-band aware
attention is proposed i.e., high frequency-band attention (HFA), and low
frequency-band attention (LFA). The U-shaped Transformer is also first time
introduced in the proposed method to further improve the speech estimation
accuracy. The extensive evaluations over four public datasets, confirm the

two key insights: (1) the similarity between the Bellman equation and the

policy simplifies the TD learning. Combined, these insights yield a practical
algorithm, Deterministic and Discriminative Imitation (D2-Imitation), which
operates by first partitioning samples into two replay buffers and then
learning a deterministic policy via off-policy reinforcement learning. Our

introduction of Maxwell's Equations and famously Dirac had hypothesized them in
the context of quantum mechanics. While they have proved experimentally elusive
as elementary particles, the concept has come to describe excitations or
topological defects in various material systems, from liquid crystals, to Hall
systems, skyrmion lattices, and Bose-Einstein condensate. Perhaps the most
versatile manifestation of magnetic monopoles as quasiparticles in matter has
been in so-called spin ice materials. There, they represent violations of the
ice rule, carry a magnetic charge, and can move freely unbound. Spin ice
emergent magnetic monopoles appear at the atomic scale in rare earth
pyrochlores or at the nano-scale in artificial spin ices systems. Here we
demonstrate for the first time that the notion of magnetic monopoles can be
transported at the macroscopic scale. We have built a mechano-magnet realized
via 3D-printing, that consists of mechanical rotors on which macroscopic
magnets can pivot. By controlling the relative height of the rotors we can
achieve different regimes for magnetic monopoles, including the free monopole
state. We then explore their driven dynamics under field. In the future,
integration of our proof of principle in an elastic matrix can lead to novel
macroscopic mechano-magnetic materials, to explore unusual piezomagnetism and
magnetostriction, with applications to actuators and soft-robotics.

prediction to provide healthcare diagnoses and treatments. To evaluate their
robustness, existing research conducts adversarial attacks in the
white/gray-box setting where model parameters are accessible. However, a more
realistic black-box adversarial attack is ignored even though most real-world
models are trained with private data and released as black-box services on the
cloud. To fill this gap, we propose the first black-box adversarial attack
method against health risk prediction models named MedAttacker to investigate
their vulnerability. MedAttacker addresses the challenges brought by EHR data
via two steps: hierarchical position selection which selects the attacked
positions in a reinforcement learning (RL) framework and substitute selection
which identifies substitute with a score-based principle. Particularly, by
considering the temporal context inside EHRs, it initializes its RL position
selection policy by using the contribution score of each visit and the saliency
score of each code, which can be well integrated with the deterministic
substitute selection process decided by the score changes. In experiments,
MedAttacker consistently achieves the highest average success rate and even
outperforms a recent white-box EHR adversarial attack technique in certain
cases when attacking three advanced health risk prediction models in the
black-box setting across multiple real-world datasets. In addition, based on
the experiment results we include a discussion on defending EHR adversarial
attacks.

crucial role in tissue regeneration. Here, we have utilized discrete network
and finite element models to study fibrous scaffold mechanics and its
dependence on structure. We have considered two loading conditions, first,
uniaxial elongation (macroscopic), and second, localized cellular forces
(microscopic). Using these two scenarios, we have tried to establish a link
between scaffold micromechanics and its macroscopic mechanical properties. We
have demonstrated that the macroscopic elastic modulus of fibrous scaffold is
dependent on the sample shape, size and the degree of fiber fusion. Under
microscopic loading conditions the deformation of the fibrous scaffolds is
anisotropic with an orientation dependent decay with distance. Further, we
explored the stiffness sensing under the conditions of fixed stress or fixed
strain application by the cells. With fixed strain, we found that the stiffness
sensed by a cell is proportional to scaffold's macroscopic Young's modulus.
However, for fixed stress application, it also depends on cell's elasticity
with stiffness experienced by stiff and soft cells differing by an order of
magnitude. The analyses demonstrate that there exists a gap between mechanical
properties of the fibrous scaffolds as measured from the macroscopic testings
and those sensed by the cells. This warrants a need for extreme care during the
designing and reporting of experiments involving cell-scaffold interactions.

with respect to permuting the vertices of the simplex. For scalar fields,
standard bases all have this symmetry property, but for vector fields, this
question is more complicated: such invariant bases may or may not exist,

  In dimensions two and three, Licht constructs such invariant bases for
certain values of the polynomial degree $r$, and he conjectures that his list
is complete, that is, that no such basis exists for other values of $r$. In
this paper, we show that Licht's conjecture is true in dimension two. However,

Practical DIP models are often substantially overparameterized. During the

and then pick up the potential modeling and observational noise, i.e.,
overfitting. Thus, the practicality of DIP often depends critically on good
early stopping (ES) that captures the transition period. In this regard, the
majority of DIP works for vision tasks only demonstrates the potential of the
models -- reporting the peak performance against the ground truth, but provides
no clue about how to operationally obtain near-peak performance without access
to the groundtruth. In this paper, we set to break this practicality barrier of
DIP, and propose an efficient ES strategy, which consistently detects near-peak

notion: one is in the quantum random oracle model, assuming quantum hardness of
SIS; and the other is in the plain model, assuming quantum hardness of LWE with
super-polynomial modulus. Prior to this work, the only known blind-unforgeable
schemes are Lamport's one-time signature and the Winternitz one-time signature,

signatures. They also present a construction that only partially achieves

conduct superposition attacks over the messages, but not the rings. We propose
a new definition that does not suffer from the above issue. Our definition is
an analog to the blind-unforgeability in the ring signature setting. Moreover,
assuming the quantum hardness of LWE, we construct a compiler converting any
blind-unforgeable (ordinary) signatures to a ring signature satisfying our

on combinations of the intuition from Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation, the

several domains, such as gaming and urban planning. VR systems can greatly help
this task by providing an immersive experience; however, a common issue with
viewing and navigating a city in the traditional sense is that users can either
obtain a local or a global view, but not both at the same time, requiring them
to continuously switch between perspectives, losing context and distracting
them from their analysis. In this paper, our goal is to allow users to navigate
to points of interest without changing perspectives. To accomplish this, we
design an intuitive navigation interface that takes advantage of the strong
sense of spatial presence provided by VR. We supplement this interface with a
perspective that warps the environment, called UrbanRama, based on a
cylindrical projection, providing a mix of local and global views. The design
of this interface was performed as an iterative process in collaboration with
architects and urban planners. We conducted a qualitative and a quantitative
pilot user study to evaluate UrbanRama and the results indicate the
effectiveness of our system in reducing perspective changes, while ensuring
that the warping doesn't affect distance and orientation perception.

on the open-source Banzai switch architecture, and synthesize them in a 15-nm

to implement accelerators for training for machine learning and for query

coupled across user-defined intervals of time, called {\it coupling windows},

to separate out the text layer and obtain text label annotations easily.
However, the cartographic styles between OSM map tiles and historical maps are

thin-cored vortex rings is investigated. It is well known that such an array
moves uniformly without change of shape or form in the direction of the central
axis of symmetry, and is therefore an equilibrium solution of Euler's
equations. In a frame of reference moving with the system of vortex rings, the
motion of passive fluid particles is investigated as a function of the two
non-dimensional parameters that define this system: $\varepsilon = a/R$, the
ratio of minor radius to major radius of the torus-shaped vortex rings, and
$\lambda = L/R$, the separation of the vortex rings normalized by their radii.
Two bifurcations in the streamline topology are found that depend significantly
on $\varepsilon$ and $\lambda$; these bifurcations delineate three distinct
shapes of the 'atmosphere' of fluid particles that move together with the
vortex ring for all time. Analogous to the case of an isolated vortex ring, the
atmospheres can be 'thin-bodied' or 'thick-bodied'. Additionally, we find the
occurrence of a 'connected' system, in which the atmospheres of neighboring
rings touch at an invariant ring of fluid particles that is stationary in a

unlike newborn animals, which learn rapidly and efficiently, CNNs are thought
to be ""data hungry,"" requiring massive amounts of training data to develop
accurate models for object recognition. This critique challenges the promise of
using CNNs as models of visual development. Here, we directly examined whether
CNNs are more data hungry than newborn animals by performing parallel
controlled-rearing experiments on newborn chicks and CNNs. We raised newborn
chicks in strictly controlled visual environments, then simulated the training
data available in that environment by constructing a virtual animal chamber in
a video game engine. We recorded the visual images acquired by an agent moving
through the virtual chamber and used those images to train CNNs. When CNNs
received similar visual training data as chicks, the CNNs successfully solved
the same challenging view-invariant object recognition tasks as the chicks.
Thus, the CNNs were not more data hungry than animals: both CNNs and chicks
successfully developed robust object models from training data of a single
object.

footpoint location. Red shifts are also seen in the H-alpha line-of-sight (LOS)
velocity image measured by the NVST at double footpoints. Those red shifts with
slow speeds can be regarded as the low-velocity downflows driven by the
chromospheric condensation. Meanwhile, the converging motions from double
footpoints to the loop top are found in the high-temperature EUV images, such
as AIA 131 A, 94 A, and 335 A. Their apparent speeds are estimated to be
roughly 126-210 km/s, which could be regarded as the high-velocity upflows

in many areas of computer vision. However, deep neural networks are trained on
images with resolutions that rarely exceed $1,000 \times 1,000$ pixels. The
growing use of scanners that create images with extremely high resolutions
(average can be $100,000 \times 100,000$ pixels) thereby presents novel
challenges to the field. Most of the published methods preprocess
high-resolution images into a set of smaller patches, imposing an a priori
belief on the best properties of the extracted patches (magnification, field of
view, location, etc.). Herein, we introduce Magnifying Networks (MagNets) as an
alternative deep learning solution for gigapixel image analysis that does not
rely on a preprocessing stage nor requires the processing of billions of
pixels. MagNets can learn to dynamically retrieve any part of a gigapixel
image, at any magnification level and field of view, in an end-to-end fashion
with minimal ground truth (a single global, slide-level label). Our results on
the publicly available Camelyon16 and Camelyon17 datasets corroborate to the
effectiveness and efficiency of MagNets and the proposed optimization framework
for whole slide image classification. Importantly, MagNets process far less
patches from each slide than any of the existing approaches ($10$ to $300$
times less).

a lot of attention. In a pioneer work by Gu, Wang and Wen, the concept of
equivalence classes of fermionic local unitary(FLU) transformations was
proposed to systematically understand non-chiral topological phases in 2D
fermion systems and an incomplete classification was obtained. On the other
hand, the physical picture of fermion condensation and its corresponding super
pivotal categories give rise to a generic mathematical framework to describe
fermionic topological phases of quantum matter. In particular, it has been
pointed out that in certain fermionic topological phases, there exists the
so-called q-type anyon excitations, which have no analogues in bosonic
theories. In this paper, we generalize the Gu, Wang and Wen construction to
include those fermionic topological phases with q-type anyon excitations. We
argue that all non-chiral fermionic topological phases in 2+1D are
characterized by a set of tensors
$(N^{ij}_{k},F^{ij}_{k},F^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kln,\chi\delta},n_{i},d_{i})$,
which satisfy a set of nonlinear algebraic equations parameterized by phase
factors $\Xi^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kl}$, $\Xi^{ij}_{kln,\chi\delta}$,
$\Omega^{kim,\alpha\beta}_{jl}$ and $\Omega^{ki}_{jln,\chi\delta}$. Moreover,
consistency conditions among algebraic equations give rise to additional
constraints on these phase factors which allow us to construct a topological
invariant partition for an arbitrary triangulation of 3D spin manifold.
Finally, several examples with q-type anyon excitations are discussed,
including the Fermionic topological phase from Tambara-Yamagami category for
$\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$, which can be regarded as the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ parafermion
generalization of Ising fermionic topological phase.

explore how to efficiently build NMT models in an FL setup by proposing a novel

small number of additional neural components connected to our pre-trained

act as liaisons to communicate with the central server and learn minimal

  We evaluated the performance of our models on five datasets from different
domains to translate from German into English. We noted that the models
equipped with Controllers preform on par with those trained in a central and
non-FL setting. In addition, we observed a substantial reduction in the
communication traffic of the FL pipeline, which is a direct consequence of
using Controllers. Based on our experiments, Controller-based models are ~6
times less expensive than their other peers. This reduction is significantly
important when we consider the number of parameters in large models and it
becomes even more critical when such parameters need to be exchanged for
multiple rounds in FL settings.

aim of this study was to assess the impact of weight loss and cardiometabolic

in brain age estimated based on voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We used three
datasets: 1) CamCAN to train the brain age prediction model, 2) Human

brain age than individuals with normal weight, and 3) pre-surgery, as well as
4, 12, and 24 month post-surgery data from participants (n=87) who underwent a
bariatric surgery to investigate whether weight loss and cardiometabolic
improvement as a result of bariatric surgery lowers the brain age. Our results
from the HCP dataset showed a higher brain age for individuals with obesity
compared to individuals with normal weight (p<0.0001). We also found
significant improvement in brain health, indicated by a decrease of 2.9 and 5.6
years in adjusted delta age at 12 and 24 months following bariatric surgery
compared to baseline (p<0.0005). While the overall effect seemed to be driven
by a global change across all brain regions and not from a specific region, our
exploratory analysis showed lower delta age in certain brain regions at 24
months. This reduced age was also associated with post-surgery improvements in
BMI, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, and HOMA-IR (p<0.05). In conclusion,
these results suggest that obesity-related brain health abnormalities might be
reversed by bariatric surgery-induced weight loss and widespread improvements

structures that are non-canonical and, in fact, have never been seen in an
infective coronavirus. Specifically, the 5-UTR has a 177 nt copy-back extension
which forms an extended, highly stable duplex RNA structure. Because of this
copy-back, the four obligate Stem Loops (SL) -1, -2, -3, and -4 cis-acting
elements found in all currently known replicating coronaviruses are buried in
the extended duplex. The 3-UTR has a similar fold-back duplex of 144 nts and is

BANAL-236 is missing eight obligate UTR cis-acting elements; each one of which
has previously been lethal to replication when modified individually. Neither
duplex copyback has ever been observed in an infective sarbecovirus, although
some of the features have been seen in defective interfering particles, which
can be found in co-infections with non-defective, replicating viruses. They are
also a common error seen during synthetic genome assembly in a laboratory.
BANAL-236 must have evolved an entirely unique mechanism for replication, RNA
translation, and RNA packaging never seen in a coronavirus and because it is a

the lack of unstable or unsynthesizable samples, which usually are not
collected and deposited in materials databases such as ICSD and Materials

data available in these databases. Here we propose a semi-supervised deep
neural network (TSDNN) model for high-performance formation energy and
synthesizability prediction, which is achieved via its unique teacher-student
dual network architecture and its effective exploitation of the large amount of
unlabeled data. For formation energy based stability screening, our
semi-supervised classifier achieves an absolute 10.3\% accuracy improvement

discover novel stable cubic structures. Out of 1000 recommended candidate

an extensible framework for deciding the threat level of cryptographic misuse
in Android apps. Firstly, we propose a general and unified specification for
representing cryptographic misuses to make our framework extensible and develop
adapters to unify the detection results of the state-of-the-art cryptographic
misuse detectors, resulting in an adapter-based detection tool chain for a more
comprehensive list of cryptographic misuses. Secondly, we employ a
misuse-originating data-flow analysis to connect each cryptographic misuse to a
set of data-flow sinks in an app, based on which we propose a quantitative
data-flow-driven metric for assessing the overall risk of the app introduced by
cryptographic misuses. To make the per-app assessment more useful for app
vetting at the app-store level, we apply unsupervised learning to predict and
classify the top risky threats to guide more efficient subsequent mitigation.
In the experiments on an instantiated implementation of the framework, we
evaluate the accuracy of our detection and the effect of data-flow-driven risk
assessment of our framework. Our empirical study on over 40,000 apps and the
analysis of popular apps reveal important security observations on the real
threats of cryptographic misuse in Android apps.

  RGB-Infrared Person Re-Identification","13 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  RGB-Infrared person re-identification (RGB-IR ReID) aims to associate people
across disjoint RGB and IR camera views. Currently, state-of-the-art
performance of RGB-IR ReID is not as impressive as that of conventional ReID.
Much of that is due to the notorious modality bias training issue brought by
the single-modality ImageNet pre-training, which might yield RGB-biased
representations that severely hinder the cross-modality image retrieval. This
paper makes first attempt to tackle the task from a pre-training perspective.
We propose a self-supervised pre-training solution, named Modality-Aware
Multiple Granularity Learning (MMGL), which directly trains models from scratch
only on multi-modal ReID datasets, but achieving competitive results against
ImageNet pre-training, without using any external data or sophisticated tuning
tricks. First, we develop a simple-but-effective 'permutation recovery' pretext
task that globally maps shuffled RGB-IR images into a shared latent permutation
space, providing modality-invariant global representations for downstream ReID
tasks. Second, we present a part-aware cycle-contrastive (PCC) learning
strategy that utilizes cross-modality cycle-consistency to maximize agreement
between semantically similar RGB-IR image patches. This enables contrastive
learning for the unpaired multi-modal scenarios, further improving the
discriminability of local features without laborious instance augmentation.
Based on these designs, MMGL effectively alleviates the modality bias training
problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it learns better
representations (+8.03% Rank-1 accuracy) with faster training speed (converge
only in few hours) and higher data efficiency (<5% data size) than ImageNet
pre-training. The results also suggest it generalizes well to various existing
models, losses and has promising transferability across datasets. The code will
be released.

Fe~II/Mg~II line-flux ratio in their broad-line regions, nearly independent of
redshift up to $z \gtrsim 6$. The high flux ratio requires rapid production of
iron in galactic nuclei to reach an abundance ratio of ${\rm [Fe/Mg]} \gtrsim
0.2$ as high as those observed in matured galaxies in the local universe. We
propose a possible explanation of rapid iron enrichment in AGNs by massive star
formation that follows a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) with a power-law
index of $\Gamma$ larger than the canonical value of $\Gamma=-2.35$ for a
Salpeter IMF. Taking into account metal production channels from different
types of SNe, we find that the high value of ${\rm [Fe/Mg]} \gtrsim 0.2$
requires the IMF to be characterized with $\Gamma \gtrsim -1$ ($\Gamma \gtrsim
0$) and a high-mass cutoff at $M_{\rm max} \simeq 100$--$150~{\rm M_\odot}$
$(M_{\rm max} \gtrsim 250~{\rm M_\odot})$. Given the conditions, core-collapse
SNe with $M_\ast \gtrsim 70~{\rm M_\odot}$ and pair-instability SNe give a
major contribution for iron enrichment. Such top-heavy stellar IMFs would be a
natural consequence from mass growth of stars formed in dense AGN disks under
Bondi-like gas accretion that is regulated by feedback at $M_\ast \gtrsim
10~{\rm M_\odot}$. The massive stellar population formed in AGN disks also
leave stellar-mass black hole remnants, whose mergers associated with
gravitational-wave emission account for at most 10 \% of the merger rate
inferred from LIGO/Virgo observations to simultaneously explain the high ${\rm
[Fe/Mg]}$ ratio with metal ejection.

axisymmetric and 3D simulations of dust and gas for a range of values for Z
(ratio of dust-to-gas (d/g) surface mass densities or metallicity), particle
Stokes numbers tau, and pressure bump amplitude A. Dust feedback onto the gas
is included. For the first time we demonstrate in global 3D simulations the
collection of dust in long-lived vortices induced by the VSI. Without a
pressure bump and for Z~0.01 and tau~0.01 we find that such vortices reach d/g
density ratios slightly below unity in the discs mid-plane, while for Z>0.05
long-lived vortices are largely absent. In presence of a pressure bump, for
Z~0.01 & tau~0.01 a dusty vortex forms reaching d/g ratios of a few times
unity, such that the SI is expected to develop, before it eventually shears out
into a turbulent dust ring. For Z~0.03 this occurs for tau~0.005, with a
weaker, more short-lived vortex, while for larger tau only a turbulent dust
ring forms. For Z>0.03 we find that the dust ring becomes increasingly
axisymmetric for increasing tau and d/g ratios reach ~1 for tau>0.005.
Furthermore, the disc's vertical mass flow profile is strongly affected by dust
for Z>0.03, such that gas is transported inward near the mid-plane and outward
at larger heights, i.e. the reversed situation compared to simulations with
zero or small amounts of dust. Viscous $\alpha$-values drop moderately as
0.001-0.0001 for increasing Z=0-0.05. Our results suggest that the VSI can play
an active role in planetesimal formation through the formation of vortices for
plausible values of Z and tau. Also it may provide a natural explanation for
the presence/absence of asymmetries of observed dust rings in PPDs, depending
on the value of Z.

maximal subgraph where each vertex has at least $k$ neighbors. A natural
extension of a $k$-core is a $(k, h)$-core, where each node must have at least
$k$ nodes that can be reached with a path of length $h$. The downside in using
$(k, h)$-core decomposition is the significant increase in the computational
complexity: whereas the standard core decomposition can be done in $O(m)$ time,
the generalization can require $O(n^2m)$ time, where $n$ and $m$ are the number
of nodes and edges in the given graph.
  In this paper we propose a randomized algorithm that produces an
$\epsilon$-approximation of $(k, h)$ core decomposition with a probability of
$1 - \delta$ in $O(\epsilon^{-2} hm (\log^2 n - \log \delta))$ time. The
approximation is based on sampling the neighborhoods of nodes, and we use
Chernoff bound to prove the approximation guarantee. We also study
distance-generalized dense subgraphs, show that the problem is NP-hard, provide
an algorithm for discovering such graphs with approximate core decompositions,
and provide theoretical guarantees for the quality of the discovered subgraphs.
We demonstrate empirically that approximating the decomposition complements the
exact computation: computing the approximation is significantly faster than
computing the exact solution for the networks where computing the exact

learning. The running time of an algorithm that computes the measure plays a
very small role in an offline setting, for example, when the classifier is
being developed by a researcher. However, the running time becomes more crucial
if our goal is to monitor the performance of a classifier over time.
  In this paper we study three algorithms for maintaining two measures. The
first algorithm maintains area under the ROC curve (AUC) under addition and
deletion of data points in $O(\log n)$ time. This is done by maintaining the
data points sorted in a self-balanced search tree. In addition, we augment the
search tree that allows us to query the ROC coordinates of a data point in
$O(\log n)$ time. In doing so we are able to maintain AUC in $O(\log n)$ time.
Our next two algorithms involve in maintaining $H$-measure, an alternative
measure based on the ROC curve. Computing the measure is a two-step process:
first we need to compute a convex hull of the ROC curve, followed by a sum over
the convex hull. We demonstrate that we can maintain the convex hull using a
minor modification of the classic convex hull maintenance algorithm. We then
show that under certain conditions, we can compute the $H$-measure exactly in
$O(\log^2 n)$ time, and if the conditions are not met, then we can estimate the
$H$-measure in $O((\log n + \epsilon^{-1})\log n)$ time. We show empirically

regularize the cooperation of SSL and DA. Inspired by the multi-views learning,
our proposed framework is composed of a shared feature encoder network and two
classifier networks, trained for contradictory purposes. Among them, one of the
classifiers is applied to group target features to improve intra-class density,
enlarging the gap of categorical clusters for robust representation learning.
Meanwhile, the other classifier, serviced as a regularizer, attempts to scatter
the source features to enhance the smoothness of the decision boundary. The
iterations of target clustering and source expansion make the target features
being well-enclosed inside the dilated boundary of the corresponding source

many real-world natural language processing tasks such as Topic Detection and
Tracking (TDT). TDT systems aim to cluster a corpus of news articles by event,
and in that context, stories that describe the same event are likely to have
been written at around the same time. Prior work on time modeling for TDT takes
this into account, but does not well capture how time interacts with the
semantic nature of the event. For example, stories about a tropical storm are
likely to be written within a short time interval, while stories about a movie
release may appear over weeks or months. In our work, we design a neural method
that fuses temporal and textual information into a single representation of
news documents for event detection. We fine-tune these time-aware document
embeddings with a triplet loss architecture, integrate the model into
downstream TDT systems, and evaluate the systems on two benchmark TDT data sets
in English. In the retrospective setting, we apply clustering algorithms to the
time-aware embeddings and show substantial improvements over baselines on the
News2013 data set. In the online streaming setting, we add our document encoder
to an existing state-of-the-art TDT pipeline and demonstrate that it can
benefit the overall performance. We conduct ablation studies on the time
representation and fusion algorithm strategies, showing that our proposed model
outperforms alternative strategies. Finally, we probe the model to examine how
it handles recurring events more effectively than previous TDT systems.

which can result in undesired motion artifacts known as rolling shutter (RS)
distortions in the captured image. Existing single image RS rectification
methods attempt to account for these distortions by either using algorithms
tailored for specific class of scenes which warrants information of intrinsic
camera parameters or a learning-based framework with known ground truth motion
parameters. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network for the
challenging task of single image RS rectification. Our network consists of a
motion block, a trajectory module, a row block, an RS rectification module and
an RS regeneration module (which is used only during training). The motion
block predicts camera pose for every row of the input RS distorted image while
the trajectory module fits estimated motion parameters to a third-order
polynomial. The row block predicts the camera motion that must be associated
with every pixel in the target i.e, RS rectified image. Finally, the RS
rectification module uses motion trajectory and the output of row block to warp
the input RS image to arrive at a distortionfree image. For faster convergence
during training, we additionally use an RS regeneration module which compares
the input RS image with the ground truth image distorted by estimated motion
parameters. The end-to-end formulation in our model does not constrain the
estimated motion to ground-truth motion parameters, thereby successfully
rectifying the RS images with complex real-life camera motion. Experiments on

into an image with a wider field of view. Existing methods warp the target
image to the reference image using the estimated warp function, and a
homography is one of the most commonly used warping functions. However, when
images have large parallax due to non-planar scenes and translational motion of
a camera, the homography cannot fully describe the mapping between two images.
Existing approaches based on global or local homography estimation are not free
from this problem and suffer from undesired artifacts due to parallax. In this
paper, instead of relying on the homography-based warp, we propose a novel deep
image stitching framework exploiting the pixel-wise warp field to handle the
large-parallax problem. The proposed deep image stitching framework consists of
two modules: Pixel-wise Warping Module (PWM) and Stitched Image Generating
Module (SIGMo). PWM employs an optical flow estimation model to obtain
pixel-wise warp of the whole image, and relocates the pixels of the target
image with the obtained warp field. SIGMo blends the warped target image and
the reference image while eliminating unwanted artifacts such as misalignments,
seams, and holes that harm the plausibility of the stitched result. For
training and evaluating the proposed framework, we build a large-scale dataset
that includes image pairs with corresponding pixel-wise ground truth warp and
sample stitched result images. We show that the results of the proposed
framework are qualitatively superior to those of the conventional methods,
especially when the images have large parallax. The code and the proposed

Clique problem, that generalizes the well known Clique problem to temporal

a temporal generalization of Independent Set. This problem is e.g. motivated in
the context of finding conflict-free schedules for maximum subsets of tasks,
that have certain (changing) constraints on each day they need to be performed.
We are specifically interested in the case where each task needs to be
performed in a certain time-interval on each day and two tasks are in conflict
on a certain day if their time-intervals on that day overlap. This leads us to
considering both problems on the restricted class of temporal unit interval
graphs, i.e., temporal graphs where each layer is a unit interval graph.
  We present several hardness results as well as positive results. On the
algorithmic side, we provide constant-factor approximation algorithms for
instances of both problems where $\tau$, the total number of time steps
(layers) of the temporal graph, and $\Delta$, a parameter that allows us to
model conflict tolerance, are constants. We develop an exact FPT algorithm for
Temporal $\Delta$ Clique with respect to parameter $\tau+k$. Finally, we use
the notion of order preservation for temporal unit interval graphs that,
informally, requires the intervals of every layer to obey a common ordering.
For both problems we provide an FPT algorithm parameterized by the size of

Their flattened spectra are likely due to atmospheric opacity sources such as
planet-wide photochemical hazes and condensation clouds. We compile the
transmission spectra of 25 warm exoplanets previously observed by the Hubble
Space Telescope and quantify the haziness of each exoplanet using a normalized
amplitude of the water absorption feature ($A_{\rm H}$). By examining the
relationships between $A_{\rm H}$ and various planetary and stellar forcing
parameters, we endeavor to find correlations of haziness associated with
planetary properties. We adopt new statistical correlation tests that are more
suitable for the small, non-normally distributed warm exoplanet sample. Our
analysis shows that none of the parameters hold statistically significant
correlation with $A_{\rm H}$ ($p \le 0.01$) with the addition of new exoplanet
data, including the previously identified linear trends between $A_{\rm H}$ and
$T_{\rm{eq}}$ or hydrogen-helium envelope mass fraction (f$_{\rm{HHe}}$). This
suggests that haziness in warm exoplanets is not simply controlled by any
single planetary/stellar parameter. Among all the parameters we investigated,
planet gravity ($g_{\rm p}$), atmospheric scale height ($H$), planet density
($\rho_{\rm p}$), orbital eccentricity ($e$), and age of the star ($t_{\rm
age}$) hold tentative correlations with $A_{\rm H}$. Specifically, lower $H$,
higher $g_{\rm p}$, $\rho_{\rm p}$, $e$, or $t_{\rm age}$ may lead to clearer
atmospheres. We still need more observations and laboratory experiments to
fully understand the complex physics and chemistry involved in creating hazy
warm exoplanets.

progressively restoring a clean image from its low-resolution versions has been
successfully employed for single image deblurring. However, a major
disadvantage of existing methods is the need for paired data; i.e. sharpblur
image pairs of the same scene, which is a complicated and cumbersome
acquisition procedure. Additionally, due to strong supervision on loss
functions, pre-trained models of such networks are strongly biased towards the
blur experienced during training and tend to give sub-optimal performance when
confronted by new blur kernels during inference time. To address the above
issues, we propose unsupervised domain-specific deblurring using a
scale-adaptive attention module (SAAM). Our network does not require supervised
pairs for training, and the deblurring mechanism is primarily guided by
adversarial loss, thus making our network suitable for a distribution of blur
functions. Given a blurred input image, different resolutions of the same image
are used in our model during training and SAAM allows for effective flow of
information across the resolutions. For network training at a specific scale,
SAAM attends to lower scale features as a function of the current scale.
Different ablation studies show that our coarse-to-fine mechanism outperforms
end-to-end unsupervised models and SAAM is able to attend better compared to
attention models used in literature. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons

allows to synthesize realistic indoor layout structures and interiors by
jointly inferring RGB panorama, layout depth, and residual depth. In addition,

species and body parts, and require a large amount of labelled keypoints for
training. Moreover, their heatmaps, tailored to specific body parts, cannot
recognize novel keypoints (keypoints not labelled for training) on unseen
species. We raise an interesting yet challenging question: how to detect both
base (annotated for training) and novel keypoints for unseen species given a
few annotated samples? Thus, we propose a versatile Few-shot Keypoint Detection
(FSKD) pipeline, which can detect a varying number of keypoints of different
kinds. Our FSKD provides the uncertainty estimation of predicted keypoints.
Specifically, FSKD involves main and auxiliary keypoint representation
learning, similarity learning, and keypoint localization with uncertainty
modeling to tackle the localization noise. Moreover, we model the uncertainty
across groups of keypoints by multivariate Gaussian distribution to exploit
implicit correlations between neighboring keypoints. We show the effectiveness
of our FSKD on (i) novel keypoint detection for unseen species, and (ii)
few-shot Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR) and (iii) Semantic Alignment
(SA) downstream tasks. For FGVR, detected keypoints improve the classification
accuracy. For SA, we showcase a novel thin-plate-spline warping that uses
estimated keypoint uncertainty under imperfect keypoint corespondences.

Boussinesq approximation, is analyzed using the fluid impulse concept. The set
of equations describing the temporal development of the fluid impulse has an
integro-differential character where the terms representing the effect of
stratification appear as convolution integral of the component of the fluid
impulse and time-depended 'memory' functions. These functions are calculated
for the case where the external parallel shear flow varies only in the
direction gravitational force and is subjected to localized two- and
three-dimensional disturbances. As follows from the solution of evolution
equations, in both cases there is a range of Richardson numbers where the fluid
impulse associated with the disturbance grows exponentially. The upper limit of
this range for two- and three-dimensional cases are Ri ~ 1.23 and Ri ~ 0.89.
Both cases are also characterized by a critical value of the Richardson number
(around Ri ~ 0.3 for both cases), beyond which the solution exhibits
oscillatory behavior. Indeed, this oscillatory behavior has been observed in
turbulent flows and, as is shown in the present study, it is an inherent
feature of a non-wavy localized vortex embedded in a stably stratified shear
flow. The paper was written in 2001 and published now without changes and new

driving policies. However, conducting efficient driving policy testing faces
two key challenges. On the one hand, the probability of naturally encountering
hazardous scenarios is low when testing a well-trained autonomous driving
strategy. Thus, discovering these scenarios by purely real-world road testing
is extremely costly. On the other hand, a proper determination of accident
responsibility is necessary for this task. Collecting scenarios with
wrong-attributed responsibilities will lead to an overly conservative
autonomous driving strategy. To be more specific, we aim to discover hazardous
scenarios that are autonomous-vehicle responsible (AV-responsible), i.e., the
vulnerabilities of the under-test driving policy.
  To this end, this work proposes a Safety Test framework by finding
Av-Responsible Scenarios (STARS) based on multi-agent reinforcement learning.
STARS guides other traffic participants to produce Av-Responsible Scenarios and
make the under-test driving policy misbehave via introducing Hazard Arbitration
Reward (HAR). HAR enables our framework to discover diverse, complex, and
AV-responsible hazardous scenarios. Experimental results against four different
driving policies in three environments demonstrate that STARS can effectively
discover AV-responsible hazardous scenarios. These scenarios indeed correspond
to the vulnerabilities of the under-test driving policies, thus are meaningful
for their further improvements.

name and the value stored in the variable do not match, then the program
suffers from a name-value inconsistency, which is due to one of two situations
that developers may want to fix: Either a correct value is referred to through
a misleading name, which negatively affects code understandability and
maintainability, or the correct name is bound to a wrong value, which may cause
unexpected runtime behavior. Finding name-value inconsistencies is hard because
it requires an understanding of the meaning of names and knowledge about the
values assigned to a variable at runtime. This paper presents Nalin, a
technique to automatically detect name-value inconsistencies. The approach
combines a dynamic analysis that tracks assignments of values to names with a
neural machine learning model that predicts whether a name and a value fit
together. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate the
problem of finding coding issues as a classification problem over names and
runtime values. We apply Nalin to 106,652 real-world Python programs, where
meaningful names are particularly important due to the absence of statically

inconsistencies with high accuracy, that the warnings reported by Nalin have a

comoving) coordinates. A classical analysis gives the main result: an explicit
metric (joined to the exterior) for the collapse. The metric then provides the
causal structure: light cones corresponding to the coordinate speed of light,
c. If the problem is perturbed from a pure dustball collapse, the solution can
only be altered within the future light cones of such perturbations.
  The metric tells us that c_{interior} << c_{exterior}. Importantly, the speed
at which the Schwarzschild radius shrinks during evaporation is intermediate
between the two. Thus a perturbation at the (shrinking) surface will only
influence the exterior in finite time. For example, if we assume evaporation to
be a process located at the dustball's surface, we can model it as a series of
perturbations to the classical solution. In this modified solution, the
interior is not altered as the evaporation process eats into a frozen interior
from the outside in; the singularity and a region near it are no longer
present; infalling particles don't cross the (shrinking) dustball boundary; the
metric coefficients don't change sign with time, and therefore timelike world
lines can exist at constant radius inside the (shrinking) Schwarzschild radius
and emerge at late times (no absolute horizon forms).
  Research on evaporation alongside collapse typically study collapsing shells
and apply quantum field theory. This paper differs in that it studies an entire
dustball and uses classical general relativity to constrain evaporation models.

the phase transitions occurring across the junction. It is found that the

rates significantly affects the topology of the phase diagram and the number of
stationary phases changes in a non-monotonic way. For both the case of equal

Specifically, we assume both the BS-user channel and the BS-RIS-user channel

estimation error under the statistical CSI error model. Then, the transmit
power of the BS is minimized, subject to the outage probability constraint and
the unit-modulus constraints on the reflecting elements. By using
Bernstein-type inequality and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to reformulate the

novel seminorm that quantifies the total ""rugosity"" of multivariate functions.
Our motivation for defining HTV is to assess the complexity of
supervised-learning schemes. We start by specifying the adequate matrix-valued
Banach spaces that are equipped with suitable classes of mixed norms. We then
show that the HTV is invariant to rotations, scalings, and translations.
Additionally, its minimum value is achieved for linear mappings, which supports
the common intuition that linear regression is the least complex learning
model. Next, we present closed-form expressions of the HTV for two general
classes of functions. The first one is the class of Sobolev functions with a
certain degree of regularity, for which we show that the HTV coincides with the
Hessian-Schatten seminorm that is sometimes used as a regularizer for image
reconstruction. The second one is the class of continuous and piecewise-linear
(CPWL) functions. In this case, we show that the HTV reflects the total change
in slopes between linear regions that have a common facet. Hence, it can be
viewed as a convex relaxation (l1-type) of the number of linear regions

electron-positron annihilation by using the Principle of Maximum Conformality
(PMC) which is a rigorous scale-setting method to eliminate the renormalization
scheme and scale ambiguities in perturbative QCD predictions. Conventionally
the renormalization scale and theoretical uncertainties in event shape
observables are often evaluated by setting the scale to the center-of-mass
energy $\sqrt{s}$. The event shape distributions using this conventional scale
setting are plagued by the large renormalization scale uncertainty and
underestimate the experimental data. Moreover, since the renormalization scale
is simply fixed to the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$, only one value of the
coupling $\alpha_s$ at the single scale $\sqrt{s}$ can be extracted. In
contrast, the PMC renormalization scales are determined by absorbing the
nonconformal $\beta$ contributions that govern the behavior of the running
coupling via the Renormalization Group Equation (RGE). The resulting PMC scales
change with event shape kinematics, reflecting the virtuality of the underlying
quark and gluon subprocess. The PMC scales thus yield the correct physical
behavior of the scale and the PMC predictions agree with precise event shape
distributions measured at the LEP experiment. More importantly, we can
precisely determine the running of the QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s(Q^2)$
over a wide range of $Q^2$ in perturbative domain from event shape
distributions measured at a single center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$.

space parameters. First, we study the charge and the AdS radius effects on the
deflection angle of RN-AdS black holes. For small values of the impact
parameter $b$, we find that the charge effect is relevant. Precisely, it
decreases the deflection angle, while the AdS background one is not. For large
values of $b$, however, these optical behaviors have been inverted and the
deflection angle becomes an increasing function of the charge. In this way, the
cosmological constant effect is remarked to be relevant showing linear
variations of the deflection angle. Varying the charge, we find a critical
impact parameter value $b_{c}$ where the charge effect is inverted. For
rotating solutions, we show that the spinning parameter still decreases the
deflection angle without any changing behavior observed in the charge effect.
Evincing of the cosmological constant, we recover known results corresponding
to charged and rotating ordinary black hole solutions. Examining the plasma
effect, we reveal that the deflection angle keeps the same behavior being a
decreasing function in terms of the frequency ratio.

30 categories regarding the fault symptoms and summarize common fix patterns
for different symptoms. Based on the results, we suggest actionable
implications on research avenues that can potentially facilitate the

satisfying the maximum latency and sojourn time constraints of vehicles. Owing

When
applied to time series, confidence intervals are computed for each time point
separately. Alternatively, we can compute confidence bands, where we are
required to find the smallest area enveloping $k$ time series, where $k$ is a
user parameter. Confidence bands can be then used to detect abnormal time
series, not just individual observations within the time series. We will show
that despite being an NP-hard problem it is possible to find optimal confidence
band for some $k$. We do this by considering a different problem: discovering
regularized bands, where we minimize the envelope area minus the number of
included time series weighted by a parameter $\alpha$. Unlike normal confidence
bands we can solve the problem exactly by using a minimum cut. By varying
$\alpha$ we can obtain solutions for various $k$. If we have a constraint $k$
for which we cannot find appropriate $\alpha$, we demonstrate a simple
algorithm that yields $O(\sqrt{n})$ approximation guarantee by connecting the
problem to a minimum $k$-union problem. This connection also implies that we
cannot approximate the problem better than $O(n^{1/4})$ under some (mild)
assumptions. Finally, we consider a variant where instead of minimizing the
area we minimize the maximum width. Here, we demonstrate a simple
2-approximation algorithm and show that we cannot achieve better approximation

measurement has drawn wide attention. By mapping a truncated numerical
optimization algorithm into a network with a fixed number of phases, recent
deep unfolding networks (DUNs) for spectral snapshot compressive sensing (SCI)
have achieved remarkable success. However, DUNs are far from reaching the scope

hierarchically fuse and interact the hidden states of previous phases to
effectively recover current HSI frames in the proximal mapping step.
Simultaneously, a hardware-friendly optimal binary mask is learned end-to-end
to further improve the reconstruction performance. Finally, our HerosNet is
validated to outperform the state-of-the-art methods on both simulation and

brightness differences asynchronously. Recovering brightness from events is
appealing since the reconstructed images inherit the high dynamic range (HDR)
and high-speed properties of events; hence they can be used in many robotic
vision applications and to generate slow-motion HDR videos. However,
state-of-the-art methods tackle this problem by training an event-to-image
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which lacks explainability and is difficult to
tune. In this work we show, for the first time, how tackling the combined
problem of motion and brightness estimation leads us to formulate event-based
image reconstruction as a linear inverse problem that can be solved without
training an image reconstruction RNN. Instead, classical and learning-based
regularizers are used to solve the problem and remove artifacts from the
reconstructed images. The experiments show that the proposed approach generates
images with visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods despite only

models in a human-learning manner, that is, start with the simplest samples and
then gradually transition to difficult knowledge. Specifically, we design a
novel framework (Humer) that can enhance the detection ability of DL-based

discover 281 unreported vulnerabilities in NVD, of which 98 have been silently

analyzing phenotypic switching in response to competing species. We show that
the stability of microbial communities with responsive switching differs
generically from that of communities with stochastic switching only. To
understand the mechanisms by which responsive switching stabilizes coexistence,
we go on to analyze simple two-species models. Combining exact results and
numerical simulations, we extend the classical stability results for the
competition of two species without phenotypic variation to the case in which
one species switches, stochastically and responsively, between two phenotypes.
In particular, we show that responsive switching can stabilize coexistence even

The applications of plasmonic nanoparticles such as refractive index sensing
and enhanced spectroscopies often rely on the sustained mode spectral position

in a change of the modes nature, its hybridization or dehybridization. These

Yet, knowledge regarding the NV-formation mechanism in very small particles is
still limited. This study focuses on the formation of the smallest
NV$^-$-containing diamonds, 5 nm detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs). As a reliable
method to quantify NV$^-$ centers in nanodiamonds, half-field signals in
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are recorded. By comparing
the NV$^-$ concentration with a series of nanodiamonds from high-pressure
high-temperature (HPHT) synthesis (10 - 100 nm), it is shown that the formation
process in 5 nm DNDs is unique in several aspects. NV$^-$ centers in DNDs are
already formed at the stage of electron irradiation, without the need for
high-temperature annealing. The effect is explained in terms of
""self-annealing"", where size and type dependent effects enable vacancy
migration close to room temperature. Although our experiments show that NV$^-$
concentration generally increases with particle size, remarkably, the NV$^-$
concentration in 5 nm DNDs surpasses that of 20 nm-sized nanodiamonds. Using
Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the ten times higher substitutional
nitrogen concentration in DNDs compensates the vacancy loss induced by the
large relative particle surface. Upon electron irradiation at a fluence of $1.5
\times 10 ^{19}$ e$^-$/cm$^2$, DNDs show a 12.5-fold increment in the NV$^-$
concentration with no sign of saturation. These findings can be of interest for
the creation of defects in other very small semiconductor nanoparticles beyond

diagnosis methods assist human experts and thereby improve maintenance
efficiency, process sustainability, and workplace safety. Improving the
automated fault diagnosis methods using data and machine learning-based models
is a central aspect of intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD). A major challenge in
IFD is to develop realistic datasets with accurate labels needed to train and
validate models, and to transfer models trained with labeled lab data to
heterogeneous process industry environments. However, fault descriptions and
work-orders written by domain experts are increasingly digitised in modern
condition monitoring systems, for example in the context of rotating equipment
monitoring. Thus, domain-specific knowledge about fault characteristics and
severities exists as technical language annotations in industrial datasets.
Furthermore, recent advances in natural language processing enable weakly
supervised model optimisation using natural language annotations, most notably
in the form of natural language supervision (NLS). This creates a timely
opportunity to develop technical language supervision (TLS) solutions for IFD
systems grounded in industrial data, for example as a complement to
pre-training with lab data to address problems like overfitting and inaccurate
out-of-sample generalisation. We surveyed the literature and identify a
considerable improvement in the maturity of NLS over the last two years,
facilitating applications beyond natural language; a rapid development of weak
supervision methods; and transfer learning as a current trend in IFD which can
benefit from these developments. Finally we describe a general framework for
TLS and implement a TLS case study based on SentenceBERT and contrastive
learning based zero-shot inference on annotated industry data.

review spherical electromagnetic radiation modes in a conducting-walled
spherical cavity and connect these modes to classical electromagnetic
zero-point radiation and to electromagnetic scale invariance. Then we turn to
the scattering of radiation in classical electron theory within a simple
approximation. We emphasize that, in steady-state, the interaction between
matter and radiation is disguised so that the mechanical motion appears to
occur without the emission of radiation, even though the particle motion is
actually driven by classical electromagnetic radiation. It is pointed out that,
for nonrelativistic particles, only the harmonic oscillator potential taken in
the low-velocity limit allows a consistent equilibrium with classical
electromagnetic zero-point radiation. For relativistic particles, only the
Coulomb potential is consistent with electrodynamics. The classical analysis
places restrictions on the value of $e^{2}/\hbar c$.

conductor modeling because it can capture the frequency-dependent variation of
skin depth with only a surface-based discretization of the structure.
Conventional BEM formulations rely on the mutual coupling of electric and
magnetic fields, and can become inaccurate or unstable at low frequencies. We
develop a new full-wave BEM formulation based on potentials which can
accurately model lossy conductors from exactly DC to very high frequencies. A
new set of simple boundary conditions is proposed along with a modified Lorenz
gauge to ensure that the proposed formulation has a stable condition number
down to DC. Moreover, coupling the potential-based integral equations to a
circuit model allows the straightforward extraction of network parameters.
Realistic numerical examples at both the chip and package level demonstrate the
accuracy and stability of the proposed method from DC to high frequencies,
beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art BEM formulations based on fields.

As one promising approach, game theory provides analytical tools for modeling

software-intensive systems using a rigorous game-theoretical framework. First,
a self-adaptation framework is deployed on a component-based software intensive
system, which periodically monitors the system for anomalous behaviors. A
learning-based method is proposed to detect possible on-going attacks on the
system components and predict potential threats to components. Then, an
algorithm is designed to automatically build a \emph{Bayesian game} based on
the system architecture (of which some components might have been compromised)
once an attack is detected, in which the system components are modeled as
independent players in the game. Finally, an optimal defensive policy is
computed by solving the Bayesian game to achieve the best system utility, which
amounts to minimizing the impact of the attack. We conduct two sets of
experiments on two general benchmark tasks for security domain. Moreover, we
systematically present a case study on a real-world water treatment testbed,

  Recommender System","8pages,7figures",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The homepage recommendation on most E-commerce applications places items in a
hierarchical manner, where different channels display items in different
styles. Existing algorithms usually optimize the performance of a single
channel. So designing the model to achieve the optimal recommendation list
which maximize the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of whole homepage is a challenge
problem. Other than the accuracy objective, display diversity on the homepage
is also important since homogeneous display usually hurts user experience. In
this paper, we propose a two-stage architecture of the homepage recommendation
system. In the first stage, we develop efficient algorithms for recommending
items to proper channels while maintaining diversity. The two methods can be
combined: user-channel-item predictive model with diversity constraint. In the
second stage, we provide an ordered list of items in each channel. Existing
re-ranking models are hard to describe the mutual influence between items in
both intra-channel and inter-channel. Therefore, we propose a Deep \&
Hierarchical Attention Network Re-ranking (DHANR) model for homepage
recommender systems. The Hierarchical Attention Network consists of an item
encoder, an item-level attention layer, a channel encoder and a channel-level
attention layer. Our method achieves a significant improvement in terms of
precision, intra-list average distance(ILAD) and channel-wise Precision@k in
offline experiments and in terms of CTR and ILAD in our online systems.

a huge public health concern with urgent need for proactive measures and
attention by authorities. With the world moving towards the 4th Industrial
Revolution, there is a need for reliable eco-friendly detective measures
towards this harmful intoxicating behavior to public health in and out of smart
cities. We developed an Interpretable feature learning framework for smoking
behavior detection which utilizes a Deep Learning VGG-16 pretrained network to
predict and classify the input Image class and a Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP) to explain the network detection or prediction of smoking
behavior based on the most relevant learned features or pixels or neurons. The
network's classification decision is based mainly on features located at the
mouth especially the smoke seems to be of high importance to the network's
decision. The outline of the smoke is highlighted as evidence for the
corresponding class. Some elements are seen as having a negative effect on the
smoke neuron and are consequently highlighted differently. It is interesting to
see that the network distinguishes important from unimportant features based on
the image regions. The technology can also detect other smokeable drugs like
weed, shisha, marijuana etc. The framework allows for reliable identification
of action-based smokers in unsafe zones like schools, shopping malls, bus
stops, railway compartments or other violated places for smoking as per the
government's regulatory health policies. With installation clearly defined in
smoking zones, this technology can detect smokers out of range.

  Study: Community College of Qatar","31 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Educational Institutions have an essential role in promoting the teaching and
learning process, within universities, colleges, and communities. Due to the
recent coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic, many educational institutions adopted
hybrid learning (HL), which is a combination of classic and online learning. It
integrates the advantages of both, and it is a fundamental factor to ensure
continued learning. Technological innovations such as HL are changing the
teaching process, and how students, lecturers, and administrators interact.
Based on this, the Community College of Qatar (CCQ) focused on researching the
structures and elements related to the adoption of HL. Thus, the goal of this
research paper is to reveal the impact of HL on the learning process in CCQ,
and the effective instructional technology (INST) tools required for a
successful HL program. Our research questions for the survey were designed to
measure the opinions of the students, instructors, and administrators about the
HL program. It is observed from the results that the majority of students,
instructors, and administrators showed a positive attitude toward HL, but some
had negative views and experienced challenges. The results were analyzed and
discussed to better utilize HL to meet the growing demands of the community.
