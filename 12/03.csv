  to Distributed Learning with Multiple Datasets",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The training phase is the most important stage during the machine learning
process. In the case of labeled data and supervised learning, machine training
consists in minimizing the loss function subject to different constraints. In
an abstract setting, it can be formulated as a multiple criteria optimization
model in which each criterion measures the distance between the output
associated with a specific input and its label. Therefore, the fitting term is
a vector function and its minimization is intended in the Pareto sense. We
provide stability results of the efficient solutions with respect to
perturbations of input and output data. We then extend the same approach to the
case of learning with multiple datasets. The multiple dataset environment is
relevant when reducing the bias due to the choice of a specific training set.
We propose a scalarization approach to implement this model and numerical
experiments in digit classification using MNIST data.

parabolic equations subject to control constraint of the form
$\|u(t)\|_{L^1(\Omega)} \le \gamma$ for $t \in (0,T)$. This limits the total
control that can be applied to the system at any instant of time. The
$L^1$-norm of the constraint leads to sparsity of the control in space, for the
time instants when the constraint is active. Due to the non-smoothness of the
constraint, the analysis of the control problem requires new techniques.
Existence of a solution, first and second order optimality conditions, and
regularity of the optimal control are proved. Further, stability of the optimal
controls with respect to $\gamma$ is investigated on the basis of different

object detection networks in testing. The suggested approach avoids the
traditional Sigmoid or Softmax prediction layer which often produces
overconfident predictions. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique
reduces overconfidence in the false positives without degrading the performance
on the true positives. The approach is validated on the 2D-KITTI objection

generalization of simple gradient-based methods suitably scaled to achieve
convergence to the optimizer in a fixed-time, independent of the

for designing fixed-time stable dynamical systems, and later providing a
consistent discretization strategy, such that the equivalent discrete-time
algorithm tracks the optimizer in a practically fixed number of iterations. We
also provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of the proposed
gradient flows, and their robustness to additive disturbances for a range of
functions obeying strong convexity, strict convexity, and possibly nonconvexity
but satisfying the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality. We also show that the
regret bound on the convergence rate is constant by virtue of the fixed-time
convergence. The hyperparameters have intuitive interpretations and can be
tuned to fit the requirements on the desired convergence rates. We validate the
accelerated convergence properties of the proposed schemes on a range of

using modest data needs and computational resources. We identify influential
accounts from different Twitter communities discussing COVID-19, and follow
these `sentinel nodes' longitudinally from July 2020 to January 2021. We
characterize sentinel nodes in terms of a linked-media preference score, and
use a standardized similarity score to examine alignment of tweets within and

the amount of misinformation propagated by sentinel nodes. Engagement with
sensationalist misinformation topics is largely confined to a cluster of
sentinel nodes that includes influential conspiracy theorist accounts, while
misinformation relating to COVID-19 severity generated widespread engagement

with each other. The result of these communications is various networks, part
of which are bipartite networks. While many studies have investigated essential
network members, less attention has been paid to the bipartite graphs. On the
other hand, one of the most critical aspects of network analysis is the
detection and extraction of communities that arise in the structure of
networks. For these reasons, we have introduced a measure called H.H to
identify influential nodes in community formation in the one-mode projection of
a bipartite graph. The three main parameters that influence this measure are
the size of the formed community, the effect of each node in the formation of
that community, and the number of communities in which the node had an impact.
The results of this paper show the differences of this measure with other
centralities (eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness
centrality, and degree centrality) and how this measure takes into account
aspects that other centralities do not. Through H.H score, we can find
essential nodes that have been effective in forming a community, and by
removing these nodes, communities can be eliminated. Any of the existing
centralities has not addressed this issue, and this measure has sufficient
independence to represent the important nodes in the formation of the
communities. Experimental validation of the proposed measure is carried out on
two real-world datasets: Southern Women Network and Person-Crime Network. The
results of the implementation of the H.H score on the Person-Crime dataset show
that by eliminating the nodes with the highest H.H score (top-10%), 29% of the
communities have changed; this is while the centralities change the average of
18% of the communities and this shows the importance of the H.H score.

selection variable. Over an uncertainty set around this selection variable, we
optimize the minimax value of a policy to achieve the best worst-case policy
value on the target population. In order to solve the minimax problem, we
derive an efficient algorithm based on a convex-concave procedure and prove
convergence for parametrized spaces of policies such as logistic policies. We
prove that, if the uncertainty set is well-specified, our policies generalize
to the target population as they can not do worse than on the training data.
Using simulated data and a clinical trial, we demonstrate that, compared to

bino/wino LSP. Relatively light wino and higgsino DM, on the other hand,
remains easily below the DM relic density upper bound. Using the improved

consider syntheses where an image contains a single or multiple objects. Our
study outlines several issues in the current evaluation pipeline: (i) for image
quality assessment, a commonly used metric, e.g., Inception Score (IS), is
often either miscalibrated for the single-object case or misused for the
multi-object case; (ii) for text relevance and object accuracy assessment,
there is an overfitting phenomenon in the existing R-precision (RP) and
Semantic Object Accuracy (SOA) metrics, respectively; (iii) for multi-object
case, many vital factors for evaluation, e.g., object fidelity, positional
alignment, counting alignment, are largely dismissed; (iv) the ranking of the
methods based on current metrics is highly inconsistent with real images. To
overcome these issues, we propose a combined set of existing and new metrics to
systematically evaluate the methods. For existing metrics, we offer an improved
version of IS named IS* by using temperature scaling to calibrate the
confidence of the classifier used by IS; we also propose a solution to mitigate
the overfitting issues of RP and SOA. For new metrics, we develop counting
alignment, positional alignment, object-centric IS, and object-centric FID
metrics for evaluating the multi-object case. We show that benchmarking with
our bag of metrics results in a highly consistent ranking among existing
methods that is well-aligned with human evaluation. As a by-product, we create
AttnGAN++, a simple but strong baseline for the benchmark by stabilizing the
training of AttnGAN using spectral normalization. We also release our toolbox,

the magnetic Reynolds number, the Lundquist number and the ratio of the angular

demonstrate that SMRI and its helically modified version can in principle be

\textit{free energy biases} when training (source) and test (target) data come
from different distributions. Inspired by this inherent mechanism, we
empirically reveal that a simple yet efficient energy-based sampling strategy
sheds light on selecting the most valuable target samples than existing

Our algorithm, Energy-based Active Domain Adaptation (EADA), queries groups of
target data that incorporate both domain characteristic and instance
uncertainty into every selection round. Meanwhile, by aligning the free energy
of target data compact around the source domain via a regularization term,
domain gap can be implicitly diminished. Through extensive experiments, we show
that EADA surpasses state-of-the-art methods on well-known challenging

the early integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Furthermore, differences in primordial
power spectra at small scales manifest themselves more significantly on the

photometric measurements and radial profiles of debris disks containing water

derived and the true parameter values. As stars in central positions we discuss
a $\beta$ Pic sibling and main-sequence stars with spectral types ranging from
A0 to K5. To simulate observable quantities we employed selected observational
scenarios regarding the choice of wavelengths and instrument characteristics.
For the $\beta$ Pic stellar model and ice fractions $\geq 50\ \%$ the derived
inner disk radius is biased by ice sublimation toward higher values. However,
the derived slope of the radial density profile is mostly unaffected. Along
with an increasing ice fraction, the slope of the grain size distribution is
overestimated by up to a median factor of $\sim 1.2$ for an ice fraction of
$90\ \%$ while the total disk mass is underestimated by a factor of $\sim 0.4$.
The reliability of the derived minimum grain size strongly depends on the

can be underestimated by a factor of $\sim 0.2$, while for solar-like stars it
is overestimated by up to a factor of $\sim 4 - 5$. Neglecting radial profile

Inelastic Scattering (DIS) for which we propose a new semi-classical approach
that accounts systematically for the longitudinal extent of the target in
contrast with the shockwave limit. In this framework, based on a partial twist
expansion, we derive a factorization formula that involves a new gauge
invariant unintegrated gluon distribution which depends explicitly on the
Feynman $x$ variable. It is shown that both the Regge and Bjorken limits are
recovered in this approach. We reproduce in particular the full one loop
inclusive DIS cross-section in the leading twist approximation and the
all-twist dipole factorization formula in the strict $x=0$ limit. Although
quantum evolution is not discussed explicitly in this work, we argue that the
proper treatment of the $x$ dependence of the gluon distribution encompasses
the kinematic constraint that must be imposed on the phase-space of gluon
fluctuations in the target to ensure stability of small-$x$ evolution.

protocol for STAR-RIS under the practical coupled phase-shift model and devise
a customized scheme to simultaneously estimate the channels of both users.
Although the problem of minimizing the resultant channel estimation error for
the ES protocol is difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to
obtain a high-quality solution by jointly designing the pilot sequences,
power-splitting ratio, and training patterns. Numerical results show the
effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation designs and reveal that the
STAR-RIS under the TS protocol achieves a smaller channel estimation error than

study is to compare and contrast two approaches for identifying feature space
basis vectors via dimensionality reduction. These approaches can be combined to
render a joint characterization that reveals spectral properties not apparent
using either approach alone. We use a diverse collection of AVIRIS-NG
reflectance spectra of the snow-firn-ice continuum to illustrate the utility of
joint characterization and identify physical properties inferred from the

t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embeddings (t-SNEs) provide physically
interpretable dimensions representing the global (PC) structure of cryospheric
reflectance properties and local (t-SNE) manifold structures revealing
clustering not resolved in the global continuum. Joint characterization reveals
distinct continua for snow-firn gradients on different parts of the Greenland
Ice Sheet and multiple clusters of ice reflectance properties common to both
glacier and sea ice in different locations. Clustering revealed in t-SNE
feature spaces, and extended to the joint characterization, distinguishes
differences in spectral curvature specific to location within the snow

PC+t-SNE joint characterization to produce a physically interpretable spectral

mean part of the particle flow is given by the sum of the gyrocenter flow and
the magnetization flow, which corresponds to the so-called magnetization law in

combination with demographic features, thus providing a realistic use case for
the embeddings. Having trialled various model/embedding configurations, we find
that our best performing embeddings lead to Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)

However, they usually struggle to generate high-quality images representing

It is well-known that deep learning models are inefficient to train; they learn
by processing millions of training data multiple times and require powerful
computational resources to process large batches of data in parallel at the
same time rather than sequentially. Deep learning models also have unexpected
failure modes; they can be fooled into misbehaviour, producing unexpectedly
incorrect predictions.
  In this thesis, we study approaches to improve the training efficiency and
robustness of deep learning models. In the context of learning visual-semantic
embeddings, we find that prioritizing learning on more informative training
data increases convergence speed and improves generalization performance on
test data. We formalize a simple trick called hard negative mining as a
modification to the learning objective function with no computational overhead.
Next, we seek improvements to optimization speed in general-purpose
optimization methods in deep learning. We show that a redundancy-aware
modification to the sampling of training data improves the training speed and
develops an efficient method for detecting the diversity of training signal,
namely, gradient clustering. Finally, we study adversarial robustness in deep
learning and approaches to achieve maximal adversarial robustness without
training with additional data. For linear models, we prove guaranteed maximal
robustness achieved only by appropriate choice of the optimizer,

spacetime dimension in the ultraviolet regime is expected to be a common
thread. The dimensionality of spacetime can be defined in various contexts. The
spectral dimension of spacetime is defined in the context of diffusion
processes on a manifold. We show that a spacetime with zero-point length has
spectral dimension $3.5$ when the characteristic diffusion time has the size of
the zero-point length. The spectral dimension (negatively) diverges for an even
shorter diffusion time, thus preventing any reliable physical interpretation in
the deep ultraviolet regime. The thermodynamic dimension is defined by
realizing that the free energy $F(\beta)$ of a free field or ideal gas at
finite temperature ($\beta^{-1}$) in $D$ dimensions scales as $F\sim
\beta^{-D}$. Using Schwinger's proper time formalism at finite temperature, we
show that for spacetime incorporating a zero-point length, the thermodynamic
dimension reduces to $1.5$ near the Planck scale and then to $1$ in the deep
ultraviolet regime. This signifies a ""phase-transition"" in which a (massless)
bosonic ideal gas in four dimensions essentially behaves like radiation
($w=1/3$) at low energies, whereas near the Planck scale, it behaves
equivalently to having an equation of state parameter $w=2$. Furthermore,
dimension can be deduced from the potential $V_D(r)$ of interaction between two
point-like sources separated at a distance $r$ as its scaling depends on $D$.
Comparing with the scaling behavior of conventional Yukawa-like potentials at
short distances, we show that the zero-point length spacetime's ultraviolet
dimension appears to be either $2$ or $3$ depending on the use of massive or
massless force carriers as probes.

more understanding by directed observations (e.g. shock breakout, $\gamma$-ray
detections) than by simply increasing the sample size. For example, the initial
emission from these transients can be a powerful probe of these explosions.
Upcoming ground-based detectors are not ideally suited to observe the initial
emission (shock emergence) of these transients. These observations require a
large field-of-view X-ray mission with a UV follow up within the first hour of
shock breakout. The emission in the first one hour to even one day provides
strong constraints on the stellar radius and asymmetries in the outer layers of
stars, the properties of the circumstellar medium (e.g. inhomogeneities in the
wind for core-collapse SNe, accreting companion in thermonuclear SNe), and the
transition region between these two. This paper describes a simulation for the
number of SNe that could be seen by a large field of view lobster eye X-ray and
UV observatory.

  Stochastic Gradient Descent",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Distributed Deep Learning (DDL) is essential for large-scale Deep Learning
(DL) training. Synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SSGD) 1 is the de facto
DDL optimization method. Using a sufficiently large batch size is critical to
achieving DDL runtime speedup. In a large batch setting, the learning rate must
be increased to compensate for the reduced number of parameter updates.
However, a large learning rate may harm convergence in SSGD and training could
easily diverge. Recently, Decentralized Parallel SGD (DPSGD) has been proposed
to improve distributed training speed. In this paper, we find that DPSGD not
only has a system-wise run-time benefit but also a significant convergence
benefit over SSGD in the large batch setting. Based on a detailed analysis of
the DPSGD learning dynamics, we find that DPSGD introduces additional
landscape-dependent noise that automatically adjusts the effective learning
rate to improve convergence. In addition, we theoretically show that this noise
smoothes the loss landscape, hence allowing a larger learning rate. We conduct
extensive studies over 18 state-of-the-art DL models/tasks and demonstrate that
DPSGD often converges in cases where SSGD diverges for large learning rates in
the large batch setting. Our findings are consistent across two different
application domains: Computer Vision (CIFAR10 and ImageNet-1K) and Automatic
Speech Recognition (SWB300 and SWB2000), and two different types of neural
network models: Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory

approximating high-dimensional functions is a very challenging task even for
powerful deep neural networks. Inspired by the Nonlinear Level set Learning
(NLL) method that uses the reversible residual network (RevNet), in this paper
we propose a new method of Dimension Reduction via Learning Level Sets (DRiLLS)
for function approximation. Our method contains two major components: one is
the pseudo-reversible neural network (PRNN) module that effectively transforms
high-dimensional input variables to low-dimensional active variables, and the
other is the synthesized regression module for approximating function values
based on the transformed data in the low-dimensional space. The PRNN not only
relaxes the invertibility constraint of the nonlinear transformation present in
the NLL method due to the use of RevNet, but also adaptively weights the
influence of each sample and controls the sensitivity of the function to the
learned active variables. The synthesized regression uses Euclidean distance in
the input space to select neighboring samples, whose projections on the space
of active variables are used to perform local least-squares polynomial fitting.
This helps to resolve numerical oscillation issues present in traditional local
and global regressions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
DRiLLS method outperforms both the NLL and Active Subspace methods, especially
when the target function possesses critical points in the interior of its input
domain.

neural networks and propagate them backward in a way that is similar yet
different than gradient back-propagation (BP). The idea was first presented as
a perturbative alternative to back-propagation that may achieve greater
accuracy in gradient evaluation when training multi-layer neural networks
(LeCun et al., 1989). However, TP has remained more of a template algorithm
with many variations than a well-identified algorithm. Revisiting insights of
LeCun et al., (1989) and more recently of Lee et al. (2015), we present a
simple version of target propagation based on regularized inversion of network
layers, easily implementable in a differentiable programming framework. We
compare its computational complexity to the one of BP and delineate the regimes
in which TP can be attractive compared to BP. We show how our TP can be used to
train recurrent neural networks with long sequences on various sequence
modeling problems. The experimental results underscore the importance of
regularization in TP in practice.

\in C(X,X)$, three notions of distributional chaos were defined. They were
denoted by $DC1, DC2$ and $DC3$. For interval systems such three notions
coincide and they will be denoted by DC-chaos. Generally speaking we have $DC1
\subseteq DC2 \subseteq DC3$-chaos.
  We wonder if it is possible that chaos can concentrate in some points and
develop a local idea of the distributional chaos. Answering to this question,
in [12] is introduced the new notion of $DCi$-points for $i = 1,2,3$. Such
special points are those in which DC-chaos of different types concentrate. Also
in [12] it is proved that if $f$ is continuous interval map with positive
topological entropy, then there is at least one DC1-point in the system.
  In this paper it is proved that in the symbolic space $(\Sigma, \sigma) $
where $\sigma$ is the shift map, every point of $\Sigma$ is a DC1-point. This
result is necessary to prove one of the main results of the paper. If $h(f) > 0
$ for an interval system, then it has an uncountable set of DC1-points and
moreover the set can be chosen perfect.
  In greater dimensions than one, we deal with triangular systems on $I^{2}$.
In this case the relationship between topological entropy and different cases
of distributional chaos is not clearly understood and several different results
are possible. In the paper we use an example of $F$ given by Kolyada in [9] to
prove that the corresponding two dimensional system $(I^{2}, F)$ has positive
topological entropy but without containing DC2-points, proving that there is no
concentration of DC2-chaos

is the factor by which the jets reduce the mass accretion rate onto the NS as
they remove mass from the envelope and inflate bubbles (cocoons). Our results
suggest that in most CEJSN events the NS-RSG binary system experiences the

transition occurs when the ground-state superradiance of cavity fields due to

photon hopping energies. We solve the Dicke trimer model on a triangle motif
with both negative and positive hopping energies and show that the latter
results in a six-fold degenerate ground-state manifold in which the
translational symmetry is spontaneously broken. In the frustrated superradiant
phase, we find that two sets of diverging time and fluctuation scales coexist,
one governed by the mean-field critical exponent and another by a novel
critical exponent. The latter is associated with the fluctuation in the
difference of local order parameters and gives rise to site-dependent photon
number critical exponents, which may serve as an experimental probe for the
frustrated superradiant phase. We provide a qualitative explanation for the
emergence of unconventional critical scalings and demonstrate that they are
generic properties of the frustrated superradiant phase at the hand of a

a light field living on a sparse point cloud. Combining differentiable volume
rendering with learned implicit density representations has made it possible to
synthesize photo-realistic images for novel views of small scenes. As neural
volumetric rendering methods require dense sampling of the underlying
functional scene representation, at hundreds of samples along a ray cast
through the volume, they are fundamentally limited to small scenes with the
same objects projected to hundreds of training views. Promoting sparse point
clouds to neural implicit light fields allows us to represent large scenes
effectively with only a single radiance evaluation per ray. These point light
fields are a function of the ray direction, and local point feature
neighborhood, allowing us to interpolate the light field conditioned training
images without dense object coverage and parallax. We assess the proposed
method for novel view synthesis on large driving scenarios, where we synthesize
realistic unseen views that existing implicit approaches fail to represent. We
validate that Neural Point Light Fields make it possible to predict videos

models in conjunction with neural networks with the end goal of being able to
better answer the question, ""what do our models know?"". From this trend,
classical metrics such as Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and
new metrics such as calibration error have entered the general repertoire of
model evaluation in order to gain better insight into how the uncertainty of
our model compares to reality. One important component of uncertainty modeling
is model uncertainty (epistemic uncertainty), a measurement of what the model
does and does not know. However, current evaluation techniques tends to
conflate model uncertainty with aleatoric uncertainty (irreducible error),
leading to incorrect conclusions. In this paper, using posterior predictive
checks, we show how calibration error and its variants are almost always
incorrect to use given model uncertainty, and further show how this mistake can
lead to trust in bad models and mistrust in good models. Though posterior
predictive checks has often been used for in-sample evaluation of Bayesian
models, we show it still has an important place in the modern deep learning
world.

voter model is a discrete-time Markov chain in $\{0,1\}^V$ where at each
time-step a randomly chosen vertex $x$ imitates the opinion of vertex $y$ with
probability $P(x,y)$. The noisy voter model is a variation of the voter model
in which vertices may change their opinions by the action of an external noise.
The strength of this noise is measured by an extra parameter $p \in [0,1]$. The
noisy voter model is a Markov chain with state space $\{0,1\}^V$, and has a
unique stationary distribution $\Gamma$ when $p > 0$. In this paper, we study
$\Gamma$ when the number of vertices in $V$ tends to infinity. In particular we
analyse the random variable $S = \sum_{x \in V}\pi(x)\xi(x)$, where $\pi$ is

one-dimensional models of actin filaments having zero width. Here, and in the
follow up paper, approaches are presented for more efficient modelling which
incorporates stretching, bending, shearing and twisting of actin filaments. Our
modelling of a semi-flexible filament with a small but finite width is based on
the Cosserat theory of elastic rods, which allows for six degrees of freedom at
every point on the filament's backbone. In the variational models presented in
this paper, a small and discrete set of parameters is used to describe a smooth
filament shape having all degrees of freedom allowed in the Cosserat theory.
Two main approaches are introduced: one where polynomial spline functions
describe the filament's configuration, and one in which geodesic curves in the
space of the configurational degrees of freedom are used. We find that in the
latter representation the strain energy function can be calculated without
resorting to a small-angle expansion, so it can describe arbitrarily large
filament deformations without systematic error. These approaches are validated
by a dynamical model of a Cosserat filament, which can be further extended by
using multi-resolution methods to allow more detailed monomer-based resolution
in certain parts of the actin filament, as introduced in the follow up paper.
The presented framework is illustrated by showing how torsional compliance in a
finite-width filament can induce broken chiral symmetry in the structure of a
cross-linked bundle.

forward a novel approach with multiplicative noise and a stochastic time that
converges to the proper time of a space-like foliation in the equilibrium
limit. Furthermore, we express the starting system of equations using the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) variables and their conjugated Hamiltonian momenta.
Such a choice is instrumental in understanding the newly derived equations in
terms of the breakdown of the diffeomorphism invariance of the classical
theory, which instead will hold on average at the steady state. We comment on
the physical interpretation of the Ricci flow equations, and argue how they can
naturally provide, in a geometrical way, the renormalization group equation for
gravity theories. In the general setting, the equation associated to the shift
vector yields the Navier-Stokes equation with a stochastic source. Moreover, we
show that the fluctuations of the metric tensor components around the
equilibrium configurations, far away from the horizon of a Schwarzschild black
hole, are forced by the Ricci flow to follow the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation,
whose probabilistic distribution can yield an intermittent statistics. We
finally comment on the possible applications of this novel scenario to the

candles, thanks to an observed non-linear relation between their X-ray and

measurement of their distances. In this paper, we use these observables for the
first time to estimate the parameters of f(R) gravity models (specifically the
Hu-Sawicki and the exponential models) together with the cosmological
parameters. The importance of this type of modified gravity theories lies in
the fact that they can explain the late time accelerated expansion of the
universe without the inclusion of a dark energy component. We have also
included other observable data to the analyses such as estimates of the Hubble
parameter H(z) from Cosmic Chronometers, the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae
compilation, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations measurements. Our results show
that the allowed space parameter is restricted when both AGN and BAO data are
added to CC and SnIa data, being the BAO data set the most restrictive one. We
can also conclude that even though our results are consistent with the ones
from the LCDM model, small deviations from General Relativity, than can be
successfully described by the f(R) models studied in this paper, are also
allowed by the considered data sets.

certain sense cannot correct erasure errors perfectly (a well-known result in
this regard being the Eastin-Knill theorem in the context of fault-tolerant
quantum computing), in contrast to the case without symmetry constraints.
Furthermore, several quantitative fundamental limits on the accuracy of such
covariant codes for approximate quantum error correction are known. Here, we
consider the quantum error correction capability of uniformly random covariant
codes. In particular, we analytically study the most essential cases of $U(1)$
and $SU(d)$ symmetries, and show that for both symmetry groups the error of the
covariant codes generated by Haar-random symmetric unitaries, i.e., unitaries
that commute with the group actions, typically scale as $O(n^{-1})$ in terms of
both the average- and worst-case purified distances against erasure noise,
saturating the fundamental limits to leading order. We note that the results
hold for symmetric variants of unitary 2-designs, and comment on the
convergence problem of symmetric random circuits. Our results not only indicate
(potentially efficient) randomized constructions of optimal $U(1)$- and
$SU(d)$-covariant codes, but also reveal fundamental properties of random
symmetric unitaries, which yield important solvable models of complex quantum
systems (including black holes and many-body spin systems) that have attracted
great recent interest in quantum gravity and condensed matter physics. We
expect our construction and analysis to find broad relevance in both physics

the relic abundance is set by the freeze-out of conversion processes. We find
that the region in parameter space where the latter occurs is considerably

matter is very weakly coupled, evading direct and indirect detection
constraints but leading to prominent signatures of long-lived particles that
provide great prospects to be probed by dedicated searches at the upcoming LHC

stations are equipped with antennas capable of detecting air showers. Since the

cosmic rays can be used as a proxy to assess the reconstruction capabilities of
the ARIANNA neutrino detector. We report on dedicated efforts of reconstructing
the polarization of cosmic-ray radio pulses. After correcting for difference in
hardware, the two stations used in this study showed similar performance in
terms of event rate and agreed with simulation. Subselecting high quality
cosmic rays, the polarizations of these cosmic rays were reconstructed with a
resolution of $2.5^{\circ}$ (68% containment), which agrees with the expected
value obtained from simulation. A large fraction of this resolution originates
from uncertainties in the predicted polarization because of the contribution of
the subdominant Askaryan effect in addition to the dominant geomagnetic
emission. Subselecting events with a zenith angle greater than $70^{\circ}$
removes most influence of the Askaryan emission, and, with limited statistics,
we found the polarization uncertainty is reduced to $1.3^{\circ}$ (68%
containment).

learning from visual demonstrations, generalizing from them requires either
hundreds of diverse demonstrations, task specific priors, or large,
hard-to-train parametric models. One reason such complexities arise is because
standard visual imitation frameworks try to solve two coupled problems at once:
learning a succinct but good representation from the diverse visual data, while
simultaneously learning to associate the demonstrated actions with such
representations. Such joint learning causes an interdependence between these
two problems, which often results in needing large amounts of demonstrations
for learning. To address this challenge, we instead propose to decouple
representation learning from behavior learning for visual imitation. First, we
learn a visual representation encoder from offline data using standard
supervised and self-supervised learning methods. Once the representations are
trained, we use non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression to predict the
actions. We experimentally show that this simple decoupling improves the
performance of visual imitation models on both offline demonstration datasets

significant challenges for generating quality candidate proposals on

pseudo-labeling, novelty classification and objectness scoring to explicitly

representation on low-level visual features without manual annotations. Most
existing methods are bottom-up approaches that try to group pixels into regions
based on their visual cues or certain predefined rules. As a result, it is
difficult for these bottom-up approaches to generate fine-grained semantic
segmentation when coming to complicated scenes with multiple objects and some
objects sharing similar visual appearance. In contrast, we propose the first
top-down unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for fine-grained
segmentation in extremely complicated scenarios. Specifically, we first obtain
rich high-level structured semantic concept information from large-scale vision
data in a self-supervised learning manner, and use such information as a prior
to discover potential semantic categories presented in target datasets.
Secondly, the discovered high-level semantic categories are mapped to low-level
pixel features by calculating the class activate map (CAM) with respect to
certain discovered semantic representation. Lastly, the obtained CAMs serve as
pseudo labels to train the segmentation module and produce the final semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks
show that our top-down unsupervised segmentation is robust to both
object-centric and scene-centric datasets under different semantic granularity
levels, and outperforms all the current state-of-the-art bottom-up methods. Our

free-viewpoint videos. Some recent works equip neural radiance fields with
image encoders, enabling them to generalize across scenes. When processing
dynamic scenes, they can simply treat each video frame as an individual scene
and perform novel view synthesis to generate free-viewpoint videos. However,
their rendering process is slow and cannot support interactive applications. A
major factor is that they sample lots of points in empty space when inferring
radiance fields. We propose a novel scene representation, called ENeRF, for the
fast creation of interactive free-viewpoint videos. Specifically, given
multi-view images at one frame, we first build the cascade cost volume to
predict the coarse geometry of the scene. The coarse geometry allows us to
sample few points near the scene surface, thereby significantly improving the
rendering speed. This process is fully differentiable, enabling us to jointly
learn the depth prediction and radiance field networks from RGB images.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our approach exhibits competitive
performance while being at least 60 times faster than previous generalizable
radiance field methods.

short- and long-range entanglement (SRE and LRE). The latter cannot be created
by finite-depth circuits, underscoring the nonlocal nature of Schr\""odinger cat
states, topological order, and quantum criticality. Remarkably, examples are
known where LRE is obtained by performing single-site measurements on SRE, such
as the toric code from measuring a sublattice of a 2D cluster state. However, a
systematic understanding of when and how measurements of SRE give rise to LRE
is still lacking. Here we establish that LRE appears upon performing
measurements on symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- of which the
cluster state is one example. For instance, we show how to implement the
Kramers-Wannier transformation, by adding a cluster SPT to an input state
followed by measurement. This transformation naturally relates states with SRE
and LRE. An application is the realization of double-semion order when the
input state is the $\mathbb Z_2$ Levin-Gu SPT. Similarly, the addition of
fermionic SPTs and measurement leads to an implementation of the Jordan-Wigner
transformation of a general state. More generally, we argue that a large class
of SPT phases protected by $G \times H$ symmetry gives rise to anomalous LRE
upon measuring $G$-charges. This introduces a new practical tool for using SPT
phases as resources for creating LRE, and uncovers the classification result
that all states related by sequentially gauging Abelian groups or by
Jordan-Wigner transformation are in the same equivalence class, once we augment
finite-depth circuits with single-site measurements. In particular, any
topological or fracton order with a solvable finite gauge group can be obtained
from a product state in this way.

operator naturally aggregates features across object discontinuities, resulting
in smooth transitions rather than clear boundaries. Therefore, in order to
circumvent this issue, we propose a novel convolutional operator which is
explicitly tailored to avoid feature aggregation of different object parts. In
particular, our method is based on estimating per-part depth values by means of
superpixels. The proposed convolutional operator, which we dub ""Instance

Specifically, Uni-Perceiver encodes different task inputs and targets from
arbitrary modalities into a unified representation space with a

uni-modal and multi-modal tasks, and evaluated on a variety of downstream
tasks, including novel tasks that did not appear in the pre-training stage.
Results show that our pre-trained model without any tuning can achieve
reasonable performance even on novel tasks. The performance can be improved to
a level close to state-of-the-art methods by conducting prompt tuning on 1% of

suggests creating a label map for the entire image. During training, it
receives the cropped region-level label by RoI aligning on a pre-generated

faster than ReLabel since no post-processes such as RoI align and softmax

natural language for representing the requirements. The model will be fed to

the testing process. The focus of our methodology will be to find faults caused
by the interaction between different requirements in ways that are difficult
for the testers to detect. Specifically, we will focus our attention to
concurrency issues such as deadlocks and logical race condition. We will use a
variety of methods that are made possible by BP, such as non-deterministic
execution of scenarios and use of in-code model-checking for building test
scenarios and for finding minimal coverage of the test scenarios for the system
requirements using Combinatorial Test Design (CTD) methodologies. We will
develop a proof-of-concept tool kit which will allow us to demonstrate and
evaluate the above mentioned capabilities. We will compare the performance of
our tools with the performance of manual testers and of other model-based tools
using comparison criteria that we will define and develop.

continuum images trace the distribution of the ionized gas surrounding a
massive star ALS 207, and the S301 H II region is bounded by an arc-like
structure of gas and dust emission in the south-eastern direction. The
north-western part of S301 seems to be devoid of gas and dust emission, while
the presence of molecular material between the NE cluster and the central
massive star ALS 207 is found. The distribution of warm dust emission, ionized
gas, and neutral hydrogen together suggests a blistered morphology of the S301
H II region powered by ALS 207, which appears to be located near the edge of
the cloud. The location of the NE cluster embedded in the cold molecular cloud
is found opposite to the blistered morphology. There is a noticeable age
difference investigated between the massive star and the NE cluster. This age
difference, pressure calculation, photodissociation regions (PDRs), and the
distribution of YSOs favour the positive feedback of the massive star ALS 207
in S301. On a wider scale of S301, the H II region and the young stellar
cluster are depicted toward the central region of a hub-filamentary system,
which is evident in the infrared images.

challenge to our understanding of dwarf galaxies in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter
(LCDM) cosmogony. The low velocity dispersion suggests either a dark halo mass
much lower than the minimum expected from hydrogen cooling limit arguments, or
one that is in the late stages of extreme tidal stripping. The tidal
interpretation has been favoured in recent work and is supported by the small
pericentric distances consistent with available kinematic estimates. We use
N-body simulations to examine this interpretation in detail, assuming a
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile for Crater II's progenitor halo. Our main
finding is that, although the low velocity dispersion can indeed result from
the effect of tides, the large size of Crater II is inconsistent with this
hypothesis. This is because galaxies stripped to match the observed velocity
dispersion are also reduced to sizes much smaller than the observed half-light
radius of Crater II. Unless its size has been substantially overestimated,
reconciling this system with LCDM requires that either (i) it is not bound and
near equilibrium (unlikely, given its crossing time is shorter than the time
elapsed since pericentre), or that (ii) its progenitor halo deviates from the
assumed NFW profile. The latter alternative may signal that baryons can affect
the inner halo cusp even in extremely faint dwarfs or, more intriguingly, may
signal effects associated with the intimate nature of the dark matter, such as
finite self-interactions, or other such deviations from the canonical LCDM
paradigm.

numbers of strongly gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe). To facilitate
timely analysis and spectroscopic follow-up before the supernova fades, an LSN
needs to be identified soon after it begins. To quickly identify LSNe in
optical survey datasets, we designed ZipperNet, a multi-branch deep neural
network that combines convolutional layers (traditionally used for images) with
long short-term memory (LSTM) layers (traditionally used for time series). We
tested ZipperNet on the task of classifying objects from four categories -- no
lens, galaxy-galaxy lens, lensed type Ia supernova, lensed core-collapse
supernova -- within high-fidelity simulations of three cosmic survey data sets
-- the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and

Among our results, we find that for the LSST-like dataset, ZipperNet classifies
LSNe with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.97,
predicts the spectroscopic type of the lensed supernovae with 79\% accuracy,
and demonstrates similarly high performance for LSNe 1-2 epochs after first
detection. We anticipate that a model like ZipperNet, which simultaneously
incorporates spatial and temporal information, can play a significant role in
the rapid identification of lensed transient systems in cosmic survey
experiments.

contamination for CNN-selected samples, and apply corrections in order to
estimate the true number of satellites as a function of projected radial
distance from their hosts. Satellite richness depends strongly on host stellar
mass, such that more massive host galaxies have more satellites, and on host
morphology, such that elliptical hosts have more satellites than disky hosts
with comparable stellar masses. We also find a strong inverse correlation
between satellite richness and the magnitude gap between a host and its
brightest satellite. The normalized satellite radial distribution between
36-300 kpc does not depend strongly on host stellar mass, morphology, or
magnitude gap. The satellite abundances and radial distributions we measure are
in reasonable agreement with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations. Our
results deliver unprecedented statistical power for studying satellite galaxy
populations, and highlight the promise of using machine learning for extending

nuclei (AGN) disks due to gravitational drag and in-situ star formation.
However, we find that due to a high gas density in an AGN disk environment,
compact objects may rapidly grow to intermediate-mass BHs and deplete matter
from the AGN disk unless accretion is suppressed by some feedback process(es).
These consequences are inconsistent with AGN observations and the dynamics of
the Galactic center. Here we consider mechanical feedback mechanisms for the
reduction of gas accretion. Rapidly accreting sBHs launch winds and/or jets via
the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, which produce high-pressure shocks and cocoons.
Such a shock and cocoon can spread laterally in the plane of the disk, eject
the outer regions of a circum-sBH disk (CsBD) and puncture a hole in the AGN
disk with horizontal size comparable to the disk scale-height. Since the
depletion timescale of the bound CsBD is much shorter than the resupply
timescale of gas to the sBH, the time-averaged accretion rate onto sBHs is
reduced by this process by a factor of $\sim 10$--$100$. This feedback
mechanism can therefore help alleviate the sBH over-growth and AGN-disk
depletion problems. On the other hand, we find that cocoons of jets can unbind
a large fraction of the gas accreting in the disks of less massive SMBHs, which
may help explain the dearth of high-Eddington ratio AGNs with SMBH mass
$\lesssim10^5{\rm M_\odot}$.

cosmological results. In this work we investigate whether including
magnification has a positive impact on the precision of the cosmological
constraints, as well as being necessary to avoid bias. We forecast this using
an LSST mock catalog and a halo model to calculate the galaxy power spectra. We
find that including magnification has little effect on the precision of the
cosmological parameter constraints for an LSST galaxy clustering analysis,
where the halo model parameters are additionally constrained by the galaxy
luminosity function. In particular, we find that for the LSST gold sample ($i <
25.3$) including weak lensing magnification only improves the galaxy clustering
constraint on $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ by a factor of 1.03, and when using a very deep
LSST mock sample ($i<26.5$) by a factor of 1.3. Since magnification
predominantly contributes to the clustering measurement and provides similar
information to that of cosmic shear, this improvement would be reduced for a
combined galaxy clustering and shear analysis. We also confirm that not
modelling weak lensing magnification will catastrophically bias the
cosmological results from LSST. Magnification must therefore be included in
LSST large-scale structure analyses even though it does not significantly
enhance the precision of the cosmological constraints.

brightness distribution of galaxies. Spiral galaxies, however, are
qualitatively different from a S\'ersic model.
  Aims. The goal of this study is to assess how accurately the total flux and
half-light radius of a galaxy with spiral arms can be recovered when fitted
with a S\'ersic profile.
  Methods. I selected a sample of bulge-dominated galaxies with spiral arms.
Using photometric data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, I estimated the
contribution of the spiral arms to their total flux. Then I generated simulated
images of galaxies with similar characteristics, fitted them with a S\'ersic
model, and quantified the error on the determination of the total flux and
half-light radius.
  Results. Spiral arms can introduce biases on the photometry of galaxies in a
way that depends on the underlying smooth surface brightness profile, the
location of the arms, and the depth of the photometric data. A set of spiral
arms accounting for 10% of the flux of a bulge-dominated galaxy typically
causes the total flux and the half-light radius to be overestimated by 15% and
30%, respectively. This bias, however, is much smaller if the galaxy is
disk-dominated.
  Conclusions. Galaxies with a prominent bulge and a non-zero contribution from
spiral arms are the most susceptible to biases in the total flux and half-light
radius, when fitted with a S\'ersic profile. If photometric measurements with
high accuracy are required, then measurements over finite apertures are to be
preferred over global estimates of the flux.

We define five categories: cluster galaxies, galaxies that have recently fallen

galaxies. For each class, we analyse the $g-r$ colour, the specific star
formation rate (sSFR), and the stellar age, as a function of the stellar mass.
For the 3D classes, we find that cluster galaxies have the lowest sSFR, and are
the reddest and the oldest, as expected from environmental effects. Backsplash
galaxies have properties intermediate between the cluster and recent infaller
galaxies. For each 2D class, we find an important contamination by other

this, we present an extensive adversarial robustness analysis of different

lattice of holes, each of which is equipped with a conformal boundary
condition. The lattice model is obtained by cutting the surface into triangles
with clipped-off edges using open channel factorisation. The parameter is given
by the hole radius. At finite radius, high energy states are suppressed and the
model is effectively finite. In the zero-radius limit, it recovers the CFT

theory.
  If one chooses a special conformal boundary condition which we call ""cloaking

topological line defects of the CFT is contained in the lattice model. The fact
that the full topological symmetry of the initial CFT is realised exactly is a
key feature of our lattice models.

waves driven by fast, wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This correlated
abundance behavior can track complex time variations in the spectral indices
during an event. In other (SEP3) events, CME-driven shock waves, days apart,
sample seed particles from a single pool of suprathermal impulsive ions

related to magnetic reconnection in solar jets, over half are subsequently
reaccelerated by CME-driven shock waves (SEP2) causing typical ion intensities
to have a 64% correlation with shock speed. In these SEP2 events, onset of
shock acceleration is signaled by a new component in the abundances, large
proton excesses. The remaining SEP1 events lack evidence of shock acceleration.

nonsplitting in an abstract elementary class (AEC), we extend known
superstability results: let $\mu>LS({\bf K})$ be a regular stability cardinal
and let $\chi$ be the local character of $\mu$-nonsplitting. The following
holds: 1. When $\mu$-nonforking is restricted to $(\mu,\geq\chi)$-limit models
ordered by universal extensions, it enjoys invariance, monotonicity,
uniqueness, existence, extension and continuity. It also has local character
$\chi$. This generalizes Vasey's result which assumed $\mu$-superstability to
obtain same properties but with local character $\aleph_0$. 2. There is
$\lambda\in[\mu,h(\mu))$ such that if ${\bf K}$ is stable in every cardinal
between $\mu$ and $\lambda$, then ${\bf K}$ has $\mu$-symmetry while
$\mu$-nonforking in (1) has symmetry. In this case (a) ${\bf K}$ has the
uniqueness of $(\mu,\geq\chi)$-limit models: if $M_1,M_2$ are both
$(\mu,\geq\chi)$-limit over some $M_0\in K_\mu$, then $M_1\cong_{M_0}M_2$; (b)
any increasing chain of $\mu^+$-saturated models of length $\geq\chi$ has a
$\mu^+$-saturated union. These generalize VanDieren-Vasey's result and remove
the symmetry assumption in Boney-VanDieren and Vasey's result. Under
$(<\mu)$-tameness, the conclusions of (1), (2)(a)(b) are equivalent to ${\bf
K}$ having the $\chi$-local character of $\mu$-nonsplitting. Grossberg and
Vasey gave eventual superstability criteria for tame AECs with a monster model.
We remove the high cardinal threshold and reduce the cardinal jump between
equivalent superstability criteria. We also add two new superstability criteria
to the list: a weaker version of solvability and the boundedness of the
$U$-rank.

highly challenging task. We approach text-to-image generation by combining the
power of the retrained CLIP representation with an off-the-shelf image
generator (GANs), optimizing in the latent space of GAN to find images that
achieve maximum CLIP score with the given input text. Compared to traditional
methods that train generative models from text to image starting from scratch,
the CLIP+GAN approach is training-free, zero shot and can be easily customized
with different generators.
  However, optimizing CLIP score in the GAN space casts a highly challenging
optimization problem and off-the-shelf optimizers such as Adam fail to yield
satisfying results. In this work, we propose a FuseDream pipeline, which
improves the CLIP+GAN approach with three key techniques: 1) an AugCLIP score
which robustifies the CLIP objective by introducing random augmentation on
image. 2) a novel initialization and over-parameterization strategy for
optimization which allows us to efficiently navigate the non-convex landscape
in GAN space. 3) a composed generation technique which, by leveraging a novel
bi-level optimization formulation, can compose multiple images to extend the
GAN space and overcome the data-bias.
  When promoted by different input text, FuseDream can generate high-quality
images with varying objects, backgrounds, artistic styles, even novel
counterfactual concepts that do not appear in the training data of the GAN we
use. Quantitatively, the images generated by FuseDream yield top-level
Inception score and FID score on MS COCO dataset, without additional
architecture design or training. Our code is publicly available at

an online fashion over $T$ slots. There are $M$ classifiers, whose confusion
matrices are unknown a priori. In each slot, at most one sample can be labeled
by any classifier. The accuracy of a sample is a function of the set of labels
obtained for it from various classifiers. The utility of a sample is a scalar
multiple of its accuracy minus the response time (difference of the departure
slot and the arrival slot), where the departure slot is also decided by the
algorithm. Since each classifier can label at most one sample per slot, there
is a tradeoff between obtaining a larger set of labels for a particular sample
to improve its accuracy, and its response time. The problem of maximizing the
sum of the utilities of all samples is considered, where learning the confusion
matrices, sample-classifier matching assignment, and sample departure slot
decisions depend on each other. The proposed algorithm first learns the
confusion matrices, and then uses a greedy algorithm for sample-classifier
matching. A sample departs once its incremental utility turns non-positive. We
show that the competitive ratio of the proposed algorithm is
$\frac{1}{2}-{\mathcal O}\left(\frac{\log T}{T}\right)$.

beyond impact at disk rim during outbursts as well as when the quiescent disk

either gas stream overflow or penetration within the frameworks of the
disk-instability (DIM) and the mass-transfer instability (MTIM) models of
outbursting disks. Gas stream overflow is not possible because the vertical
scaleheight of the stream is significantly lower than that of the outer disk
and because there is no combination of parameters which enables stream overflow
on a larger disk while preventing it on a smaller disk. Stream penetration
requires the gas stream to be denser than the outer disk regions. This
requirement cannot be met by a low-viscosity DIM disk because its density is
significantly larger than that of the gas stream over the whole range of mass
transfer rates where the thermal-viscous instability occurs. On the other hand,
the high-viscosity MTIM disk has much lower densities which decrease with
increasing radius, easily allowing for gas stream penetration during outbursts
(when mass transfer rate and stream density increase) as well as in large
quiescent disks. The observed features are not consistent with DIM, but can be
plausibly explained by MTIM. These results suggest that the outbursts of YZ LMi
are the response of a high-viscosity disk to bursts of enhanced mass transfer
rate. In this case, the outburst decline timescale of (2-3) d implies a
viscosity parameter in the range alpha=3-4.

a natural language description of the code change and its purpose. Messages are
critical for software maintenance and program comprehension. Unlike documenting
feature updates and bug fixes, little is known about how developers document
their refactoring activities. Developers can perform multiple refactoring
operations, including moving methods, extracting classes, for various reasons.
Yet, there is no systematic study that analyzes the extent to which the
documentation of refactoring accurately describes the refactoring operations
performed at the source code level. Therefore, this paper challenges the
ability of refactoring documentation to adequately predict the refactoring
types, performed at the commit level. Our analysis relies on the text mining of
commit messages to extract the corresponding features that better represent
each class. The extraction of text patterns, specific to each refactoring
allows the design of a model that verifies the consistency of these patterns
with their corresponding refactoring. Such verification process can be achieved
via automatically predicting the method-level type of refactoring being
applied, namely Extract Method, Inline Method, Move Method, Pull-up Method,
Push-down Method, and Rename Method. We compared various classifiers, and a
baseline keyword-based approach, in terms of their prediction performance,

refactoring type prediction varies from one type to another. Rename method and
Extract method were found to be the best documented refactoring activities,

  Previous work on this problem has largely assumed extreme scenarios in which
either the player has almost no information about the input, or the player is

by exploring multiple goals is a complex task. Domain-specific optimization
goals (e.g. maximize output variance) are useful for guiding the rapid
selection of test cases via mutation. But evaluating the selected test cases
via mutation (that can distinguish the current program from the mutated

optimization goals can be used to guide the mutation analysis, that guidance
should be viewed as a weak indicator since it can hurt the mutation
effectiveness goals by focusing too much on the optimization goals. Based on
the above, this paper proposes DoLesS (Domination with Least Squares
Approximation) that selects the minimal and effective test cases by averaging
over a coarse-grained grid of the information gained from multiple
optimizations goals. DoLesS applies an inverted least squares approximation
approach to find a minimal set of tests that can distinguish better from worse

benchmark for the adversarial robustness of image classification networks. In
its most commonly reported sub-task, RobustBench evaluates and ranks the
adversarial robustness of trained neural networks on CIFAR10 under AutoAttack
(Croce and Hein 2020b) with l-inf perturbations limited to eps = 8/255. With
leading scores of the currently best performing models of around 60% of the
baseline, it is fair to characterize this benchmark to be quite challenging.
Despite its general acceptance in recent literature, we aim to foster
discussion about the suitability of RobustBench as a key indicator for
robustness which could be generalized to practical applications. Our line of
argumentation against this is two-fold and supported by excessive experiments
presented in this paper: We argue that I) the alternation of data by AutoAttack
with l-inf, eps = 8/255 is unrealistically strong, resulting in close to
perfect detection rates of adversarial samples even by simple detection
algorithms and human observers. We also show that other attack methods are much
harder to detect while achieving similar success rates. II) That results on
low-resolution data sets like CIFAR10 do not generalize well to higher
resolution images as gradient-based attacks appear to become even more
detectable with increasing resolutions.

many researchers agree that information at different levels of abstraction
likely differs in its makeup and structure and processing mechanisms, agreement
on the particulars of such differences is not generally shared in the research

this way and that knowledge at any level of abstraction involves what we refer
to as neurosymbolic information, meaning that data at both high and low levels

systems they are technologically demanding. Therefore, determining the
constraints posed by linear optics and optimizing linear optical operations for
specific tasks under those constraints, without the use of ancillas, can
facilitate their potential implementation. Here, we consider the task of
unambiguously discriminating between Bell-like states without the use of
ancillary photons. This is a basic problem relevant in diverse settings, for
example, in the measurement of the output of an entangling quantum circuit or
for entanglement swapping at a quantum repeater station. While it is known that
exact Bell states of two qubits can be discriminated with an optimal success
probability of 50% we find, surprisingly, that for Bell-like states the optimal
probability can be only 25%. We analyze a set of Bell-like states in terms of
their distinguishability, entanglement as measured by concurrence, and
parameters of the beam-splitter network used for unambiguous discrimination.
Further, we provide the linear optical configuration comprised of single photon
detectors and beam splitters with input state-dependent parameters that
achieves optimal discrimination in the Bell-like case.

estimate the trajectory of an object over time by fusing data from a number of
sources, of which 2D and 3D imagery is only one. In this paper, we show how to
use a deep feature encoding in conjunction with generative densities over the
features in a factor-graph based, probabilistic tracking framework. We present
a likelihood model that combines a learned feature encoder with generative
densities over them, both trained in a supervised manner. We also experiment
with directly inferring probability through the use of image classification
models that feed into the likelihood formulation. These models are used to
implement deep factors that are added to the factor graph to complement other
factors that represent domain-specific knowledge such as motion models and/or
other prior information. Factors are then optimized together in a non-linear
least-squares tracking framework that takes the form of an Extended Kalman
Smoother with a Gaussian prior. A key feature of our likelihood model is that
it leverages the Lie group properties of the tracked target's pose to apply the
feature encoding on an image patch, extracted through a differentiable warp
function inspired by spatial transformer networks. To illustrate the proposed
approach we evaluate it on a challenging social insect behavior dataset, and
show that using deep features does outperform these earlier linear appearance

Then, a three stage recovery strategy is proposed to recover the ground truth

at the peak, it was possible to collect a complete and unique set of
multi-channel follow-up observations, which allowed us to determine all
parameters vital for the characterisation of the lens and the source in the

subsequently intensively followed up with a network of ground-based
observatories and the Spitzer Space Telescope. We collected multiple
high-resolution spectra with Very Large Telescope (VLT)/X-Shooter to
characterise the source star. The event was also observed with VLT
Interferometer (VLTI)/PIONIER during the peak. Here we focus on the photometric
observations and model the light curve composed of data from Gaia, Spitzer, and
multiple optical, ground-based observatories. We find the best-fitting solution
with parallax and finite source effects. We derived the limit on the luminosity
of the lens based on the blended light model and spectroscopic distance. We
compute the mass of the lens to be $1.13 \pm 0.03~M_{\odot}$ and derive its
distance to be $5.52^{+0.35}_{-0.64}~\mathrm{kpc}$. The lens is likely a main
sequence star, however its true nature has yet to be verified by future
high-resolution observations. Our results are consistent with interferometric
measurements of the angular Einstein radius, emphasising that interferometry

its importance in improving training data quality. Satisfactory noise detection
has been achieved by adopting ensembles of classifiers. In this approach, an
instance is assigned as mislabeled if a high proportion of members in the pool
misclassifies it. Previous authors have empirically evaluated this approach;
nevertheless, they mostly assumed that label noise is generated completely at
random in a dataset. This is a strong assumption since other types of label
noise are feasible in practice and can influence noise detection results. This
work investigates the performance of ensemble noise detection under two
different noise models: the Noisy at Random (NAR), in which the probability of
label noise depends on the instance class, in comparison to the Noisy
Completely at Random model, in which the probability of label noise is entirely
independent. In this setting, we investigate the effect of class distribution
on noise detection performance since it changes the total noise level observed
in a dataset under the NAR assumption. Further, an evaluation of the ensemble
vote threshold is conducted to contrast with the most common approaches in the
literature. In many performed experiments, choosing a noise generation model
over another can lead to different results when considering aspects such as
class imbalance and noise level ratio among different classes.

challenging. Here, we present a new ""differential"" representation of the

dynamic systems and in so doing gain insight into the underlying physics. This
technique has been used in numerous fields including materials science, shock

In many of these applications, however, complications resulting from noise,
scatter, complex beam dynamics, etc. prevent the reconstruction of density from
being accurate enough to identify the underlying physics with sufficient
confidence. As such, density reconstruction from static/dynamic radiography has
typically been limited to identifying discontinuous features such as cracks and
voids in a number of these applications.
  In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach to reconstructing
density from a temporal sequence of radiographic images. Using only the robust
features identifiable in radiographs, we combine them with the underlying
hydrodynamic equations of motion using a machine learning approach, namely,
conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN), to determine the density
fields from a dynamic sequence of radiographs. Next, we seek to further enhance
the hydrodynamic consistency of the ML-based density reconstruction through a
process of parameter estimation and projection onto a hydrodynamic manifold. In
this context, we note that the distance from the hydrodynamic manifold given by
the training data to the test data in the parameter space considered both
serves as a diagnostic of the robustness of the predictions and serves to
augment the training database, with the expectation that the latter will
further reduce future density reconstruction errors. Finally, we demonstrate
the ability of this method to outperform a traditional radiographic
reconstruction in capturing allowable hydrodynamic paths even when relatively
small amounts of scatter are present.

Inverting the spatial Fourier transform, the critical layer contribution is
given as the non-modal contribution from integrating around the continuous

give a neutrally stable non-modal wave with a phase velocity equal to the mean
flow velocity at the source when the source is located within the sheared-flow

Nevertheless, it remains unclear under what conditions the trained model's

training, this study provides a theoretical analysis of generalization
performance in a solvable case of continual learning. We consider neural
networks in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime that continually learn
target functions from task to task, and investigate the generalization by using
an established statistical mechanical analysis of kernel ridge-less regression.
We first show characteristic transitions from positive to negative transfer.
More similar targets above a specific critical value can achieve positive
knowledge transfer for the subsequent task while catastrophic forgetting occurs
even with very similar targets. Next, we investigate a variant of continual
learning which supposes the same target function in multiple tasks. Even for
the same target, the trained model shows some transfer and forgetting depending
on the sample size of each task. We can guarantee that the generalization error
monotonically decreases from task to task for equal sample sizes while
unbalanced sample sizes deteriorate the generalization. We respectively refer
to these improvement and deterioration as self-knowledge transfer and
forgetting, and empirically confirm them in realistic training of deep neural
networks as well.

been suggested that this approach can be certified with the Linear
Cross-Entropy Benchmark (XEB). We critically examine this notion. First, in a
""benign"" setting where an honest implementation of noisy quantum circuits is
assumed, we characterize the conditions under which the XEB approximates the
fidelity. Second, in an ""adversarial"" setting where all possible classical
algorithms are considered for comparison, we show that achieving relatively
high XEB values does not imply faithful simulation of quantum dynamics. We
present an efficient classical algorithm that, with 1 GPU within 2s, yields
high XEB values, namely 2-12% of those obtained in experiments. By identifying
and exploiting several vulnerabilities of the XEB, we achieve high XEB values
without full simulation of quantum circuits. Remarkably, our algorithm features
better scaling with the system size than noisy quantum devices for commonly
studied random circuit ensembles. To quantitatively explain the success of our
algorithm and the limitations of the XEB, we use a theoretical framework in
which the average XEB and fidelity are mapped to statistical models. We
illustrate the relation between the XEB and the fidelity for quantum circuits
in various architectures, with different gate choices, and in the presence of
noise. Our results show that XEB's utility as a proxy for fidelity hinges on
several conditions, which must be checked in the benign setting but cannot be

systems. PCM has asymmetric access energy; writes dominate reads. MLC asymmetry
can vary by an order of magnitude. Many schemes have been developed to take
advantage of the asymmetric patterns of 0s and 1s in the data to reduce write
energy. Because the memory is non-volatile, data can be recovered via physical
attack or across system reboot cycles. To protect information stored in PCM
against these attacks requires encryption. Unfortunately, most encryption
algorithms scramble 0s and 1s in the data, effectively removing any patterns
and negatively impacting schemes that leverage data bias and similarity to
reduce write energy. In this paper, we introduce Virtual Coset Coding (VCC) as
a workload-independent approach that reduces costly symbol transitions for
storing encrypted data. VCC is based on two ideas. First, using coset encoding
with random coset candidates, it is possible to effectively reduce the
frequency of costly bit/symbol transitions when writing encrypted data. Second,
a small set of random substrings can be used to achieve the same encoding
efficiency as a large number of random coset candidates, but at a much lower
encoding/decoding cost. Additionally, we demonstrate how VCC can be leveraged
for energy reduction in combination with fault-mitigation and fault-tolerance
to dramatically increase the lifetimes of endurance-limited NVMs, such as PCM.
We evaluate the design of VCC and demonstrate that it can be implemented
on-chip with only a nominal area overhead. VCC reduces dynamic energy by 22-28%
while maintaining the same performance. Using our multi-objective optimization
approach achieves at least a 36% improvement in lifetime over the
state-of-the-art and at least a 50% improvement in lifetime vs. an unencoded
memory, while maintaining its energy savings and system performance.

Analytical and numerical models for Darrieus turbines have been presented, and
the ability to evaluate power curve tables from both models has been
demonstrated. Double-Multiple Streamtube model was implemented for the
analytical modelling, and 2-D CFD simulations on OpenFOAM were developed for
the numerical modelling. The analytical model was found to fail for small-sized

starting characteristics for constant wind speed. Auto-regressive moving
average models were implemented to characterize historical wind speed
measurements, thus synthesizing wind speed scenarios. For this, the wind speeds

combine information exposed by multiple different web APIs to create a unique
identifier for tracking users across the web. Over the last decade, trackers
have abused several existing and newly proposed web APIs to further enhance the
browser fingerprint. Existing approaches are limited to detecting a specific
fingerprinting technique(s) at a particular point in time. Thus, they are
unable to systematically detect novel fingerprinting techniques that abuse
different web APIs. In this paper, we propose FP-Radar, a machine learning
approach that leverages longitudinal measurements of web API usage on top-100K
websites over the last decade, for early detection of new and evolving browser
fingerprinting techniques. The results show that FP-Radar is able to early
detect the abuse of newly introduced properties of already known (e.g., WebGL,
Sensor) and as well as previously unknown (e.g., Gamepad, Clipboard) APIs for
browser fingerprinting. To the best of our knowledge, FP-Radar is also the
first to detect the abuse of the Visibility API for ephemeral fingerprinting in
the wild.

Changes with time scales of minutes, hours, days, and months are observed.
Semiannual night sky brightness variations are coincident with changes in the
orientation of Earth's magnetic field relative to the interplanetary magnetic
field. Solar wind plasma streams from solar coronal holes arriving at Earth's
bow shock nose are coincident with major night sky brightness increase events.
Sites more than 8500 km along the Earth's surface experience nights in common
with either very bright or very faint night sky airglow emissions. The reason
for this observational fact remains an open question. It is plausible,
terrestrial night airglow and geomagnetic indices have similar responses to the
solar energy input into Earth's magnetosphere. Our empirical results contribute
to a quantitative basis for understanding and predicting broadband night sky
brightness variations. They are applicable in astronomical, planetary science,

This approach automatically processes historical map images to extract their

Survey from 2005, which significantly improved their fitted orbits. With these
refinements we ran backwards orbital integrations to study formation and
evolutionary history. We found that neither a pure gravitational model nor a
model with the Yarkovsky effect could explain their current orbits. We thus
implemented two models of comet-like non-gravitational forces based on water or
CO sublimation. The first model assumed quasi-continuous, comet-like activity
after separation, which suggested a formation time of the asteroid pair
$300^{+120}_{-70}$ years ago. The second model assumed short-term activity for
up to one heliocentric orbit ($\sim$13.9 years) after separation, which
suggested that the pair formed 272$\pm$7 years ago. Image stacks showed no
activity for 2019~PR2 during its last perihelion passage. These results
strongly argue for a common origin that makes these objects the youngest
asteroid pair known to date. Questions remain regarding whether these objects
derived from a parent comet or asteroid, and how activity may have evolved
since their separation.

semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones. Semantic knowledge is
learned from attribute descriptions shared between different classes, which act
as strong priors for localizing object attributes that represent discriminative
region features, enabling significant visual-semantic interaction. Although
some attention-based models have attempted to learn such region features in a
single image, the transferability and discriminative attribute localization of
visual features are typically neglected. In this paper, we propose an
attribute-guided Transformer network, termed TransZero, to refine visual
features and learn attribute localization for discriminative visual embedding
representations in ZSL. Specifically, TransZero takes a feature augmentation
encoder to alleviate the cross-dataset bias between ImageNet and ZSL
benchmarks, and improves the transferability of visual features by reducing the
entangled relative geometry relationships among region features. To learn
locality-augmented visual features, TransZero employs a visual-semantic decoder
to localize the image regions most relevant to each attribute in a given image,
under the guidance of semantic attribute information. Then, the
locality-augmented visual features and semantic vectors are used to conduct
effective visual-semantic interaction in a visual-semantic embedding network.
Extensive experiments show that TransZero achieves the new state of the art on
three ZSL benchmarks. The codes are available at:

consistent with a scenario where HzRGs get older and more massive as the

length and processes the tokens in the same way as words in natural language
processing. More tokens normally lead to better performance but considerably
increased computational cost. Motivated by the proverb ""A picture is worth a
thousand words"" we aim to accelerate the ViT model by making a long image
short. To this end, we propose a novel approach to assign token length
adaptively during inference. Specifically, we first train a ViT model, called
Resizable-ViT (ReViT), that can process any given input with diverse token
lengths. Then, we retrieve the ""token-length label"" from ReViT and use it to
train a lightweight Token-Length Assigner (TLA). The token-length labels are
the smallest number of tokens to split an image that the ReViT can make the
correct prediction, and TLA is learned to allocate the optimal token length
based on these labels. The TLA enables the ReViT to process the image with the
minimum sufficient number of tokens during inference. Thus, the inference speed
is boosted by reducing the token numbers in the ViT model. Our approach is
general and compatible with modern vision transformer architectures and can
significantly reduce computational expanse. We verified the effectiveness of
our methods on multiple representative ViT models (DeiT, LV-ViT, and

sets and outputs a prediction of which will produce a material with a more
desirable property specified by the operator. We demonstrate the success of DPC
on AA7075 tube manufacturing process and mechanical property data using shear

We show that by focusing on the experimenter's need to choose between multiple

linearity and high dynamic range, characteristics that have not been widely
demonstrated for CMOS imagers. We report the performance, over temperatures
from 140 - 240 K, of a radiation hardened SRI 4Kx2K back-side illuminated CMOS
image sensor with surface treatments that make it highly sensitive in blue and
UV bands. After suppressing emission from glow sites resulting from defects in
the engineering grade device examined in this work, a 0.077 me-/s dark current
floor is reached at 160 K, rising to 1 me$^-$/s at 184 K, rivaling that of the
best CCDs. We examine the trade-off between readout speed and read noise,
finding that 1.43 e$^-$ median read noise is achieved using line-wise digital
correlated double sampling at 700 kpix/s/ch corresponding to a 1.5 s readout
time. The 15 ke$^-$ well capacity in high gain mode extends to 120 ke$^-$ in
dual gain mode. Continued collection of photo-generated charge during readout
enables a further dynamic range extension beyond $10^6$ e$^-$ effective well
capacity with only 1% loss of exposure efficiency by combining short and long
exposures. A quadratic fit to correct for non-linearity reduces gain correction
residuals from 1.5% to 0.2% in low gain mode and to 0.4% in high gain mode.
Cross-talk to adjacent pixels is only 0.4% vertically, 0.6% horizontally and

Comparing with the classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, the SMPNP
equations add a nonlinear term to each of the Nernst-Planck (NP) fluxes to
describe the steric repulsion which can treat multiple nonuniform particle
sizes in simulations. Since the new terms include sums and gradients of ion
concentrations, the nonlinear coupling of SMPNP equations is much stronger than
that of PNP equations. By introducing a generalized Slotboom transform, each of
the size-modified NP equation is transformed into a self-adjoint equation with
exponentially behaved coefficient, which has similar simple form to the
standard NP equation with the Slotboom transformation. This treatment enables
employing our recently developed inverse averaging technique to deal with the
exponential coefficients of the reformulated formulations, featured with
advantages of numerical stability and flux conservation especially in strong
nonlinear and convection-dominated cases. Comparing with previous stabilization
methods, the IAFEM proposed in this paper can still possess the numerical
stability when dealing with convection-dominated problems. And it is more
concise and easier to be numerically implemented. Numerical experiments about a
model problem with analytic solutions are presented to verify the accuracy and
order of IAFEM for SMPNP equations. Studies about the size-effects of a sphere

treat the unannotated objects as background. To address this issue, we propose
a simple yet surprisingly powerful data augmentation and training scheme we
call Learning to Detect Every Thing (LDET). To avoid suppressing hidden
objects, background objects that are visible but unlabeled, we paste annotated
objects on a background image sampled from a small region of the original

from domain shift, we decouple the training into two parts: 1) training the
region classification and regression head on augmented images, and 2)~training
the mask heads on original images. In this way, a model does not learn to
classify hidden objects as background while generalizing well to real images.
LDET leads to significant improvements on many datasets in the open-world

and a set associated with a learned set to set distance. To this end, we
formulate the metric as a weighted sum on the tangent bundle of the hyperbolic
space and develop a mechanism to obtain the weights adaptively and based on the
constellation of the points. This not only makes the metric local but also
dependent on the task in hand, meaning that the metric will adapt depending on
the samples that it compares. We empirically show that such metric yields
robustness in the presence of outliers and achieves a tangible improvement over
baseline models. This includes the state-of-the-art results on five popular
few-shot classification benchmarks, namely mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet,
Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB), CIFAR-FS, and FC100.

detection of malicious behavior in cybersecurity. However, their sensitivity to

such adversarial variants by the defender is crucial to improving the
resistance of DL-based malware detectors against them. This necessity has given
rise to an emerging stream of machine learning research, Adversarial Malware
example Generation (AMG), which aims to generate evasive adversarial malware
variants that preserve the malicious functionality of a given malware. Within
AMG research, black-box method has gained more attention than white-box

the malware detectors to generate adversarial malware examples. Given that most
malware detectors enforce a query limit, this could result in generating
non-realistic adversarial examples that are likely to be detected in practice
due to lack of stealth. In this study, we show that a novel DL-based causal

oriented close to the observer's line of sight. Blazars have very complex
variability properties. Flares, namely flux variations around the mean value
with a well-defined shape and duration, are one of the identifying properties
of the blazar phenomenon. Blazars are known to exhibit multi-wavelength flares,
but also ""orphan"" flares, namely flux changes that appear only in a specific
energy range. Various models, sometimes at odds with each other, have been
proposed to explain specific flares even for a single source, and cannot be
synthesized into a coherent picture. In this paper, we propose a unified model
for explaining orphan and multi-wavelength flares from blazars in a common
framework. We assume that the blazar emission during a flare consists of two
components: (i) a quasi-stable component that arises from the superposition of
numerous but comparatively weak dissipation zones along the jet, forming the
background (low-state) emission of the blazar, and (ii) a transient component,
which is responsible for the sudden enhancement of the blazar flux, forming at
a random distance along the jet by a strong energy dissipation event. Whether a
multi-wavelength or orphan flare is emitted depends on the distance from the
base of the jet where the dissipation occurs. Generally speaking, if the
dissipation occurs at a small/large distance from the supermassive black hole,
the inverse Compton/synchrotron radiation dominates and an orphan
gamma-ray/optical flare tends to appear. On the other hand, we may expect a
multi-wavelength flare if the dissipation occurs at an intermediate distance.
We show that the model can successfully describe the spectral energy
distribution of different flares from the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 and

and from a latent representation space with good generalization properties.
Often, real-world collections of shapes have symmetries, which can be defined
as transformations that do not change the essence of the shape. A natural way
to incorporate symmetries in shape space learning is to ask that the mapping to
the shape space (encoder) and mapping from the shape space (decoder) are
equivariant to the relevant symmetries.
  In this paper, we present a framework for incorporating equivariance in
encoders and decoders by introducing two contributions: (i) adapting the recent
Frame Averaging (FA) framework for building generic, efficient, and maximally
expressive Equivariant autoencoders; and (ii) constructing autoencoders
equivariant to piecewise Euclidean motions applied to different parts of the
shape. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully piecewise
Euclidean equivariant autoencoder construction. Training our framework is
simple: it uses standard reconstruction losses and does not require the
introduction of new losses. Our architectures are built of standard (backbone)
architectures with the appropriate frame averaging to make them equivariant.
Testing our framework on both rigid shapes dataset using implicit neural
representations, and articulated shape datasets using mesh-based neural
networks show state-of-the-art generalization to unseen test shapes, improving
relevant baselines by a large margin. In particular, our method demonstrates
significant improvement in generalizing to unseen articulated poses.

that the parity and magnitude of the non-zero Berry curvature's components

in a cloudy environment, the outflow-cloud interactions may form shock waves
which generate accelerated protons and hence delayed neutrinos from hadronic

for an outflow with a velocity of 0.07c and a kinetic luminosity of $10^{45}\rm

and generate PeV neutrinos by interactions with clouds. The predicted neutrino

analysis utilizes three measures of financial development created by IMF,
namely, financial institutional development index, financial market development
index and a composite index of financial development, encompassing dimensions
of financial access, depth and efficiency. Johansen cointegration, vector error
correction model and vector auto regressive model are estimated to examine the
long run relationship and short run dynamics among the variables of interest.
The econometric results indicate that there is indeed a long run causal
relationship between the composite index of financial development and trade
openness. Cointegration is also found to exist between trade openness and index
of financial market development. However, there is no evidence of cointegration
between financial institutional development and trade openness. Granger
causality test results indicate the presence of uni-directional causality
running from composite index of financial development to trade openness.
Financial market development is also found to Granger cause trade openness. In
contrast, trade openness is found to promote financial institutional
development in the short run. Empirical evidence thus underlines the importance
of formulating policies which recognize the role of well-developed financial
markets in accelerating international trade of Indian economy.

with mostly low-resolution (LR) inputs. Our method is built upon Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) that predicts per-point density and color with a
multi-layer perceptron. While producing images at arbitrary scales, NeRF
struggles with resolutions that go beyond observed images. Our key insight is
that NeRF benefits from 3D consistency, which means an observed pixel absorbs
information from nearby views. We first exploit it by a supersampling strategy
that shoots multiple rays at each image pixel, which further enforces
multi-view constraint at a sub-pixel level. Then, we show that NeRF-SR can
further boost the performance of supersampling by a refinement network that
leverages the estimated depth at hand to hallucinate details from related
patches on only one HR reference image. Experiment results demonstrate that
NeRF-SR generates high-quality results for novel view synthesis at HR on both
synthetic and real-world datasets without any external information.

cast as a problem of localization in the many-body Hilbert space, which is
studied by the FEAST eigensolver algorithm. At low dopings, magnons and JW
fermions are better defined than spin-1/2 fermions, which are unstable. Upon
crossing a critical value of doping around $p_c$ = 1/3, their stabilities are
interchanged. Near the critical doping, these quasiparticles are all found to
be ill-defined. The critical point is thus associated with a localization

(LC) modelling of selected blazars: six flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and
five BL Lacertae (BL Lacs). All objects have densely sampled and long-term LCs,
over 10 years. For each blazar we generated three LCs with 7, 10, and 14 days
binning, using the latest LAT 8-year source catalog and binned analysis
provided within the fermipy package. The LCs were modelled with several tools:
the Fourier transform, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), the autoregressive
moving average (ARMA), the fractional autoregressive integrated moving average,
the continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes, the Hurst
exponents ($H$), the $\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{T}$ plane, and the wavelet
scalogram. The power law indices $\beta$ calculated from the Fourier and LSP
modelling are consistent with each other. Many objects yield $\beta\simeq 1$,
with PKS 2155$-$304 even flatter, but some are significantly steeper, e.g. Mrk
501 and B2 1520+31. The power law PSD is indicative of a self-affine stochastic
process characterised by $H$, underlying the observed variability. Several
algorithms for the $H$ estimations are employed. For some objects we found
$H>0.5$, indicating long-term memory. We confirm a quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO) in the PKS 2155$-$304 data with the period of $612\pm 42$ days at a
$3\sigma$ significance level, but do not detect any QPOs in other objects. The
ARMA results give in general higher orders for 7 days binned LCs and lower
orders for 10 and 14 days binned LCs, implying temporal variations in the LCs
are consistently captured by the fitted models. CARMA modelling leads to
featureless PSDs. The recently introduced $\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{T}$ plane
allows us to successfully classify the PSDs based on the LCs alone and clearly
separates the FSRQ and BL Lac types of blazars.

debate. Observations for intracluster magnetic fields over a wide range of
redshifts are crucial to constrain possible scenarios for the origin and
evolution of the fields. (Differences of Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of an
embedded double radio sources, i.e. a pair of lobes of mostly Fanaroff--Riley
type II radio galaxies, are free from the Faraday rotation contributions from
the interstellar medium inside the Milky Way and the intergalactic medium

average magnetic field within galaxy clusters.) We have obtained a sample of
627 pairs whose RMs and redshifts are available in the most updated RM
catalogues and redshift databases. The RM differences of the pairs are derived.
The statistically large RM differences for pairs of redshifts $z>0.9$ indicate
that intracluster magnetic fields is as strong as about 4~$\mu$G. Such strong
magnetic fields in the intracluster medium at the half age of the Universe,
comparable to intracluster field strength in nearby galaxy clusters, pose a
challenge on the theories for origin of cosmic magnetic fields.

of many users under time-varying SAT network topology. This makes existing
multiple access protocols, such as random access channel (RACH) based cellular

eRACH is a model-free approach that emerges through interaction with the
non-stationary network environment, using multi-agent deep reinforcement

does not require central coordination or additional communication across users,
while training convergence is stabilized through the regular orbiting patterns.
Compared to RACH, we show from various simulations that our proposed eRACH
yields 54.6% higher average network throughput with around two times lower
average access delay while achieving 0.989 Jain's fairness index.

  Prior","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning-based methods for low-light image enhancement typically require
enormous paired training data, which are impractical to capture in real-world
scenarios. Recently, unsupervised approaches have been explored to eliminate
the reliance on paired training data. However, they perform erratically in
diverse real-world scenarios due to the absence of priors. To address this
issue, we propose an unsupervised low-light image enhancement method based on
an effective prior termed histogram equalization prior (HEP). Our work is
inspired by the interesting observation that the feature maps of histogram
equalization enhanced image and the ground truth are similar. Specifically, we
formulate the HEP to provide abundant texture and luminance information.
Embedded into a Light Up Module (LUM), it helps to decompose the low-light
images into illumination and reflectance maps, and the reflectance maps can be
regarded as restored images. However, the derivation based on Retinex theory
reveals that the reflectance maps are contaminated by noise. We introduce a
Noise Disentanglement Module (NDM) to disentangle the noise and content in the
reflectance maps with the reliable aid of unpaired clean images. Guided by the
histogram equalization prior and noise disentanglement, our method can recover
finer details and is more capable to suppress noise in real-world low-light
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably
against the state-of-the-art unsupervised low-light enhancement algorithms and
even matches the state-of-the-art supervised algorithms.

formulated skin cancer diagnosis as a simple classification task, dismissing
the potential benefit from lesion segmentation. We argue that an accurate
lesion segmentation can supplement the classification task with additive lesion
information, such as asymmetry, border, intensity, and physical size; in turn,
a faithful lesion classification can support the segmentation task with
discriminant lesion features. To this end, this paper proposes a new multi-task
framework, named MT-TransUNet, which is capable of segmenting and classifying
skin lesions collaboratively by mediating multi-task tokens in Transformers.
Furthermore, we have introduced dual-task and attended region consistency
losses to take advantage of those images without pixel-level annotation,
ensuring the model's robustness when it encounters the same image with an
account of augmentation. Our MT-TransUNet exceeds the previous state of the art
for lesion segmentation and classification tasks in ISIC-2017 and PH2; more
importantly, it preserves compelling computational efficiency regarding model
parameters (48M~vs.~130M) and inference speed (0.17s~vs.~2.02s per image). Code

exchange of vibrational modes induced along the waveguide mainly due to
radiation pressure. The problem of many-body photons is treated in using the
formalism of contour Green's functions under the T-matrix approximation. The
complex pole of the T-matrix is a signature for the appearance of
photon-molecules. The analysis of such singularity provides the critical
temperature at which the T-matrix approximation breaks down and
photon-molecules appear. For strongly interacting slow photons the amplitude of
the photon-molecule wavefunction acquires a significant quantum nonlinear phase
inside the nanowire. Photon bound-states can be implemented for quantum
information processing as quantum logic gates, e.g. for $\pi$ phase shift the
photon-molecule is shown to serve as a Z-controlled gate.

limited amount of training data. In current data-driven approaches for radar
detection, re-training is generally required when the operating environment
changes, incurring large overhead in terms of data collection and training
time. In contrast, this paper proposes two novel deep learning-based approaches
that enable fast adaptation of detectors based on few data samples from a new
environment. The proposed methods integrate prior knowledge regarding
previously encountered radar operating environments in two different ways. One
approach is based on transfer learning: it first pre-trains a detector such
that it works well on data collected in previously observed environments, and
then it adapts the pre-trained detector to the specific current environment.
The other approach targets explicitly few-shot training via meta-learning:
based on data from previous environments, it finds a common initialization that
enables fast adaptation to a new environment. Numerical results validate the
benefits of the proposed two approaches compared with the conventional method
based on training with no prior knowledge. Furthermore, the meta-learning-based
detector outperforms the transfer learning-based detector when the clutter is
Gaussian.

shows richer complexity in magnetic field line evolution compared to the MHD.
The magnetic reconnections triggering the flare are explored by numerical
simulations augmented with relevant multi-wavelength observations. The initial
coronal magnetic field is constructed by non-force-free extrapolation of
photospheric vector magnetic field. Magnetic structure involved in the flare is
identified to be a flux rope, with its overlying magnetic field lines
constituting the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) along with a three-dimensional
null point and a null line. Compared to the MHD simulation, the HMHD simulation
shows a higher and faster ascend of the rope together with the overlying field
lines, which further reconnect at the QSL located higher up in the corona. The
foot points of the field lines match better with the observations for the HMHD
case with the central part of the flare ribbon located at the chromosphere.
Additionally, field lines are found to rotate in a circular pattern in the
HMHD, whereas no such rotation is seen in the MHD results. Interestingly,
plasma is also observed to be rotating in a co-spatial chromospheric region,
which makes the HMHD simulation more credible. Based on the aforementioned

this kind of loss is oversimplified so that it is inconsistent with the final
evaluation metric, intersection over union (IoU). Directly employing the
standard IoU is also not infeasible, since the constant-zero plateau in the
case of non-overlapping boxes and the non-zero gradient at the minimum may make
it not trainable. Accordingly, we propose a systematic method to address these
problems. Firstly, we propose a new metric, the extended IoU (EIoU), which is
well-defined when two boxes are not overlapping and reduced to the standard IoU
when overlapping. Secondly, we present the convexification technique (CT) to
construct a loss on the basis of EIoU, which can guarantee the gradient at the
minimum to be zero. Thirdly, we propose a steady optimization technique (SOT)
to make the fractional EIoU loss approaching the minimum more steadily and
smoothly. Fourthly, to fully exploit the capability of the EIoU based loss, we
introduce an interrelated IoU-predicting head to further boost localization
accuracy. With the proposed contributions, the new method incorporated into

Instead, every module defines its own hyper-parameters and a local tree

autoregressive models as generation part has yielded high-quality results on
image generation. However, the autoregressive models will strictly follow the
progressive scanning order during the sampling phase. This leads the existing
VQ series models to hardly escape the trap of lacking global information.
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) in the continuous domain have
shown a capability to capture the global context, while generating high-quality
images. In the discrete state space, some works have demonstrated the potential
to perform text generation and low resolution image generation. We show that
with the help of a content-rich discrete visual codebook from VQ-VAE, the
discrete diffusion model can also generate high fidelity images with global
context, which compensates for the deficiency of the classical autoregressive
model along pixel space. Meanwhile, the integration of the discrete VAE with
the diffusion model resolves the drawback of conventional autoregressive models
being oversized, and the diffusion model which demands excessive time in the
sampling process when generating images. It is found that the quality of the
generated images is heavily dependent on the discrete visual codebook.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Vector Quantised Discrete
Diffusion Model (VQ-DDM) is able to achieve comparable performance to top-tier
methods with low complexity. It also demonstrates outstanding advantages over

computing capability, deep learning has been widely used in the field of
hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. In general, deep learning models
often contain many trainable parameters and require a massive number of labeled
samples to achieve optimal performance. However, in regard to HSI
classification, a large number of labeled samples is generally difficult to
acquire due to the difficulty and time-consuming nature of manual labeling.
Therefore, many research works focus on building a deep learning model for HSI
classification with few labeled samples. In this article, we concentrate on
this topic and provide a systematic review of the relevant literature.
Specifically, the contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the research
progress of related methods is categorized according to the learning paradigm,
including transfer learning, active learning and few-shot learning. Second, a
number of experiments with various state-of-the-art approaches has been carried
out, and the results are summarized to reveal the potential research
directions. More importantly, it is notable that although there is a vast gap
between deep learning models (that usually need sufficient labeled samples) and
the HSI scenario with few labeled samples, the issues of small-sample sets can
be well characterized by fusion of deep learning methods and related
techniques, such as transfer learning and a lightweight model. For

in computer graphics and 3D vision. However, deep learning currently lags in
hierarchical modeling of 3D surfaces due to the lack of required operations
and/or their efficient implementations. In this paper, we propose a series of
modular operations for effective geometric feature learning from 3D triangle
meshes. These operations include novel mesh convolutions, efficient mesh
decimation and associated mesh (un)poolings. Our mesh convolutions exploit
spherical harmonics as orthonormal bases to create continuous convolutional
filters. The mesh decimation module is GPU-accelerated and able to process
batched meshes on-the-fly, while the (un)pooling operations compute features
for up/down-sampled meshes. We provide open-source implementation of these
operations, collectively termed Picasso. Picasso supports heterogeneous mesh
batching and processing. Leveraging its modular operations, we further
contribute a novel hierarchical neural network for perceptual parsing of 3D
surfaces, named PicassoNet++. It achieves highly competitive performance for
shape analysis and scene segmentation on prominent 3D benchmarks. The code,

have different origins such as secular formation from the disc material.

to enable the Sim2Real learning, i.e., firstly training models in simulation
before deploying them on the real robot. However, some artefacts in the real
objects are unpredictable, such as imperfections caused by fabrication
processes, or scratches by the natural wear and tear, and thus cannot be
represented in the simulation, resulting in a significant gap between the
simulated and real tactile images. To address this Sim2Real gap, we propose a
novel texture generation network that maps the simulated images into
photorealistic tactile images that resemble a real sensor contacting a real
imperfect object. Each simulated tactile image is first divided into two types
of regions: areas that are in contact with the object and areas that are not.
The former is applied with generated textures learned from real textures in the
real tactile images, whereas the latter maintains its appearance as when the
sensor is not in contact with any object. This makes sure that the artefacts
are only applied to the deformed regions of the sensor. Our extensive
experiments show that the proposed texture generation network can generate
these realistic artefacts on the deformed regions of the sensor, while avoiding
leaking the textures into areas of no contact. Quantitative experiments further
reveal that when using the adapted images generated by our proposed network for
a Sim2Real classification task, the drop in accuracy caused by the Sim2Real gap
is reduced from 38.43% to merely 0.81%. As such, this work has the potential to
accelerate the Sim2Real learning for robotic tasks requiring tactile sensing.

automatize, using modern tools, the latter stabilization approach to (i) expand
its scope of applicability and (ii) yield semi-continuous exact $p$-values, as
opposed to exact critical values for fixed significance levels. We show
improvements on the stabilization accuracy of the exact null distributions of

mathematical model and a numerical solution approach for coupling fluid flow

strong coupling between hydraulic and mechanical processes, the material
discontinuity the fractures represent in the medium, the wide range of spatial

fracture contact mechanics, allowing fractures to frictionally slide. Fracture
propagation is handled at the microscale, where the maximum tangential stress
criterion triggers the propagation of fractures, and Paris' law governs the

specifically where several causal MABs operate chronologically in the same

governed by the same non-trivial dependence structure, which is a dynamic
causal model. Dynamic because we allow for each causal MAB to depend on the
preceding MAB and in doing so are able to transfer information between agents.
Our contribution, the Chronological Causal Bandit (CCB), is useful in discrete
decision-making settings where the causal effects are changing across time and
can be informed by earlier interventions in the same system. In this paper, we
present some early findings of the CCB as demonstrated on a toy problem.

computational core of ASRs are deep neural networks (DNNs) that have been shown
to be susceptible to adversarial perturbations; easily misused by attackers to
generate malicious outputs. To help test the security and robustnesss of ASRS,
we propose techniques that generate blackbox (agnostic to the DNN), untargeted
adversarial attacks that are portable across ASRs. This is in contrast to
existing work that focuses on whitebox targeted attacks that are time consuming
and lack portability.
  Our techniques generate adversarial attacks that have no human audible
difference by manipulating the audio signal using a psychoacoustic model that
maintains the audio perturbations below the thresholds of human perception. We
evaluate portability and effectiveness of our techniques using three popular
ASRs and two input audio datasets using the metrics - Word Error Rate (WER) of
output transcription, Similarity to original audio, attack Success Rate on
different ASRs and Detection score by a defense system. We found our
adversarial attacks were portable across ASRs, not easily detected by a
state-of-the-art defense system, and had significant difference in output
transcriptions while sounding similar to original audio.

analysis (PCA) as a tool to extract the Sq variation of the geomagnetic field.
We tested different geomagnetic field components and used data measured at
different levels of the solar and geomagnetic activity and during different
months. Geomagnetic field variations obtained with PCA were classified as SqPCA
using two types of reference series: SqIQD series calculated using
geomagnetically quiet days and simulations of the ionospheric field with
models. The results for the X and Y and Z components are essentially different.
The Sq variation is always filtered to the first PCA mode for the Y and Z
components. Thus, PCA can automatically extract the Sq variation from the
observations of the Y and Z components of the geomagnetic field. For the X
component, the automatic extraction of the Sq variation is not possible, and a
complimentary analysis, like a comparison to a reference series, is always
needed. We tested two types of reference series: the mean SqIQD and the outputs
of the CM5 and DIFI3 models. Our results show that both the data-based and
model-based reference series can be used but the DIFI3 model performs better.
We also recommend estimating the similarity of the series not with the
correlation analysis but using metrics that account for possible local
stretching/compressing of the compared series, for example, the dynamic time
warping (DTW) distance.

presented with a wide range of solid-particle concentration from dilute to
dense limit. The two phase flow is simulated by two coupled flow solvers, i.e.,
the gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for the gas phase and unified gas-kinetic
wave-particle method (UGKWP) for the particle phase. The GKS is a second-order
Navier-Stokes flow solver for the continuum flow. The UGKWP is a multiscale
method for all flow regimes. The wave and particle decomposition in UGKWP
depends on the cell's Knudsen number (Kn). At a small Kn number, the high
concentrated solid particle phase will be modeled by the Eulerian hydrodynamic
wave due to the intensive particle-particle collisions. At a large Kn number,
the dilute solid particle will be sampled and followed by the Lagrangian
particle formulation to capture the non-equilibrium transport. In the
transition regime, the distribution and evolution of particle and wave in UGKWP
are controlled by the local Kn number with a smooth transition between the
above limits. In the current scheme, the two phase model improves the previous
one in all following aspects: drag force model for different solid particle
concentrations; the frictional pressure in inter-particle contacts at high
solid-particle concentration; a flux limiting model to avoid solid particles'
over-packing; additional non-conservative nozzle and work terms for the gas
phase. Besides, the inter-particle collisions have been refined numerically for
the dense particle flow through the discretization of the collision term and
numerical flux function. The numerical scheme is tested in a series of typical
gas-particle problems. The results validate the accuracy and reliability of the
proposed method for gas-particle flow.

The learned universal representations serve as representative and benchmarkable

interactions between the in-contact objects and the robot, that are often not
accessible via remote sensing. Tactile sensors can be grouped into two main
categories: electronic tactile skins and camera based optical tactile sensors.
The former are slim and can be fitted to different body parts, whereas the
latter assume a more prismatic shape and have much higher sensing resolutions,
offering a good advantage for being used as robotic fingers or fingertips. One
of such optical tactile sensors is our GelTip sensor that is shaped as a finger
and can sense contacts on any location of its surface. As such, the GelTip
sensor is able to detect contacts from all the directions, like a human finger.
To capture these contacts, it uses a camera installed at its base to track the
deformations of the opaque elastomer that covers its hollow, rigid and
transparent body. Thanks to this design, a gripper equipped with GelTip sensors
is capable of simultaneously monitoring contacts happening inside and outside
its grasp closure. Experiments carried out using this sensor demonstrate how
contacts can be localised, and more importantly, the advantages, and even
possibly a necessity, of leveraging all-around touch sensing in dexterous
manipulation tasks in clutter where contacts may happen at any location of the

due to its potential to resolve the scalability problem of supervised Re-ID
models. Most existing unsupervised methods adopt an iterative clustering
mechanism, where the network was trained based on pseudo labels generated by
unsupervised clustering. However, clustering errors are inevitable. To generate
high-quality pseudo-labels and mitigate the impact of clustering errors, we
propose a novel clustering relationship modeling framework for unsupervised
person Re-ID. Specifically, before clustering, the relation between unlabeled
images is explored based on a graph correlation learning (GCL) module and the
refined features are then used for clustering to generate high-quality
pseudo-labels.Thus, GCL adaptively mines the relationship between samples in a
mini-batch to reduce the impact of abnormal clustering when training. To train
the network more effectively, we further propose a selective contrastive
learning (SCL) method with a selective memory bank update policy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method shows much better results than most
state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17
datasets. We will release the code for model reproduction.

volatility of the portfolio on a certain level. The uncertainty in the TVS
risky portfolio composition along with the difference in hedging costs for each

derive an analytical solution of the problem in the Black and Scholes (BS)

how the performances of the RL agents are compatible with those obtained by
applying path-wise the BS analytical strategy to the TVS dynamics, which
therefore appears competitive also in the LV scenario.

frequently observed in experiments. Such unknown fluctuating noise leads to
systematic errors and nullifies the quantum advantages. Here, we propose an

that our protocol mitigates systematic errors and recovers superclassical

frequencies is a challenging problem in time series analysis. One way to handle
this problem is lifting the 2-dimensional time-frequency representation to a
3-dimensional representation, called time-frequency-chirp rate (TFC)
representation, by adding one extra chirp rate parameter so that crossover
frequencies are disentangled in higher dimension. The chirplet transform is an
algorithm for this lifting idea, which leads to a TFC representation. However,
in practice, we found that it has a strong ``blurring'' effect in the chirp
rate axis, which limits its application in real-world data. Moreover, to our
knowledge, we have limited mathematical understanding of the chirplet transform
in the literature. Motivated by the need for the real-world data analysis, in
this paper, we propose the synchrosqueezed chirplet transform (SCT) that
enhances the TFC representation given by the chirplet transform. The resulting
concentrated TFC representation has high contrast so that one can better
distinguish different modes with crossover instantaneous frequencies. The basic
idea is to use the phase information in the chirplet transform to determine a
reassignment rule that sharpens the TFC representation determined by the
chirplet transform. We also analyze the chirplet transform and provide
theoretical guarantees of SCT.

Here we propose the concept of nonlinear QEC (NLQEC), where the encoded states
are not necessarily a linear combination of codewords. We introduce a
sufficiency criterion for NLQEC with respect to the subclass of states. The new
criterion gives a more relaxed condition for the formation of a QEC code, such
that under the assumption that the states are within the subclass of states,
the errors are correctable. This allows us, for instance, to effectively
circumvent the no-go theorems regarding optical QEC for Gaussian states and

  Analysis of VSC with Periodical Steady State",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear Time Periodic (LTP) framework-based analysis of Voltage Source
Converters (VSCs) is becoming popular, a driven factor is that many of the
existing VSC applications inevitably exhibit the periodic steady-state (PSS),
e.g., VSCs with unbalanced grid connections and the operation of a modular
multilevel converter (MMC). In these studies, acquisition of the VSC's PSS
conditions is a necessary precondition for proper linearization and stability
analysis, and the efficiency of this process is particularly important for
parametric studies. To this end, this work develops a computational method for
automating the LTP analyses of VSCs with an integrated PSS solver. The core of
the method lies in a unified frequency-domain iteration process that is
developed by applying the generalized averaging principle. Given this,
modeling, stability analysis, as well as the solution of PSS conditions can be
unified in one process. The algorithmic implementation of the method in MATLAB
is elaborated. Application of the obtained tool in impedance generation and
parametric stability test is presented with an unbalanced grid-tied VSC as the
exemplification. Finally, PSCAD/EMTDC simulations further consolidate the
validity of the results.

that this model contains, as limiting cases, both the standard spherical
collapse model and the Zeldovich solution for a 1-dimensional perturbation. We
study how these models are affected by small anisotropic perturbations within
the BIX potential. For the spherical collapse case, we found that the model is
equivalent to a closed FLRW Universe filled with matter and two perfect fluids
representing the anisotropic contributions. From the linear evolution up to the
turnaround, the anisotropies effectively shift the value of the FLRW spatial
curvature, because the fluids have effective Equation of State (EoS) parameters
$w \approx -1/3$. Then we estimate the impact of such anisotropies on the
number density of haloes using the Press-Schechter formalism. If a fluid
description of the anisotropies is still valid after virialization, the
averaged over time EoS parameters are $w\approx 1/3$. Using this and demanding
hydrostatic equilibrium, we find a relation between the mass $M$, the average
radius $R$ and the pressure $p$ of the virialized final structure. When we
consider perturbations of the Zeldovich solution, our qualitative analysis
suggests that the so called \textit{pancakes} exhibit oscillatory behavior, as
would be expected in the case of a vacuum BIX spacetime.

both the particle-hole symmetry and the dispersive nature of nonreciprocal

break-down and the Chern topology becomes ill-defined. It is shown that due to
the divergence of the density of photonic states in plasmonic systems the gap
Chern numbers can be non-integer notwithstanding that the relevant parametric

the random networks into several universality classes, according to the

Interestingly, it is revealed that such a classification has a close

choices of random connectivity in the RC. Subsequently, we investigate the
relationship between the RC's computational power and the network parameters

broadband data, which is unfortunate as these quantities are needed to
interpret and predict astronomical and planetary observations. The goal of this
work is to address these lacking data, using an experimental broadband method
that is capable of rapidly providing reliable water ice data across the entire
UV-visible range. This approach combines the simultaneous use of a
monochromatic HeNe laser and a broadband Xe-arc lamp to record interference
fringes of water ice during deposition at astronomically relevant ice
temperatures. The ice thickness is typically more than 20 $\mu$m. Analyzing the
period and intensity patterns combining both the monochromatic and broadband

refractive index and extinction coefficient. We present accurate refractive

For the massive scalar field, it is found that the anti-Unruh effect which

stereo configuration, which yields a computationally efficient and robust
method compared to conventional stereo matching. We further extend it to a full
SLAM system with loop closure to reduce accumulated errors. With the assumption
of forward camera motion, we imitate a LiDAR scan using the 3D points obtained
from the visual odometry and adapt a LiDAR descriptor for place recognition to
facilitate more efficient detection of loop closures. Afterward, we estimate
the relative pose using direct alignment by minimizing the photometric error
for potential loop closures. Optionally, further improvement over direct
alignment is achieved by using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm.
Lastly, we optimize a pose graph to improve SLAM accuracy globally. By avoiding

important task for financial institutions. As the joint log-returns of asset
prices can often be projected to a latent space of a much smaller dimension,
the use of a variational autoencoder (VAE) for estimating the VaR is a natural
suggestion. To ensure the bottleneck structure of autoencoders when learning
sequential data, we use a temporal VAE (TempVAE) that avoids an auto-regressive
structure for the observation variables. However, the low signal- to-noise
ratio of financial data in combination with the auto-pruning property of a VAE
typically makes the use of a VAE prone to posterior collapse. Therefore, we
propose to use annealing of the regularization to mitigate this effect. As a
result, the auto-pruning of the TempVAE works properly which also results in
excellent estimation results for the VaR that beats classical GARCH-type and
historical simulation approaches when applied to real data.

However, the recorded events are often too fine-granular and result in
unstructured models that are not meaningful for analysis. Log abstraction
therefore aims to group together events to obtain a higher-level representation
of the event sequences. While such a transformation shall be driven by the
analysis goal, existing techniques force users to define how the abstraction is
done, rather than what the result shall be. In this paper, we propose GECCO, an
approach for log abstraction that enables users to impose requirements on the
resulting log in terms of constraints. GECCO then groups events so that the
constraints are satisfied and the distance to the original log is minimized.
Since exhaustive log abstraction suffers from an exponential runtime
complexity, GECCO also offers a heuristic approach guided by behavioral
dependencies found in the log. We show that the abstraction quality of GECCO is
superior to baseline solutions and demonstrate the relevance of considering
constraints during log abstraction in real-life settings.

subclinical, which results in challenging early detection of the disease.
However, characteristic changes in the anatomy can be detected using imaging
techniques such as MRI or CT. Modern imaging techniques such as chemical
exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI drive the hope to improve early
detection even further through the imaging of metabolites in the body. To image
small structures in the joints of patients, typically one of the first regions
where changes due to the disease occur, a high resolution for the CEST MR
imaging is necessary. Currently, however, CEST MR suffers from an inherently
low resolution due to the underlying physical constraints of the acquisition.
In this work we compared established up-sampling techniques to neural
network-based super-resolution approaches. We could show, that neural networks
are able to learn the mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution
unsaturated CEST images considerably better than present methods. On the test
set a PSNR of 32.29dB (+10%), a NRMSE of 0.14 (+28%), and a SSIM of 0.85 (+15%)
could be achieved using a ResNet neural network, improving the baseline
considerably. This work paves the way for the prospective investigation of
neural networks for super-resolution CEST MRI and, followingly, might lead to a
earlier detection of the onset of rheumatic diseases.

threshold for distinguishing relaxed and unrelaxed clusters is naturally
determined by the crossing point of the double-Gaussian fitting which has a

locally. But in actual scenarios like dynamic edge computing networks (DECN),
due to fluctuations in available computing resources of intermediate servers
and changes in bandwidth during data transmission, service reliability becomes
difficult to guarantee. Coupled with changes in the amount of data in a
service, the above three problems all make the existing reliability evaluation
methods no longer accurate. To study the effect of distributed service
deployment strategies under such a background, this paper proposes a
reliability evaluation method (REMR) based on lower boundary rule under time
constraint to study the degree of the rationality of a service deployment plan
combined with DECN. In this scenario, time delay is the main concern which
would be affected by three quantitative factors: data packet storing and
sending time, data transmission time and the calculation time of executing
sub-tasks on the node devices, specially while the last two are in dynamic
scenarios. In actual calculation, based on the idea of the minimal paths, the
solution set would to be found that can meet requirements in the current
deployment. Then the reliability of the service supported by the solution sets
would be found out based on the principle of inclusion-exclusion combined with
the distribution of available data transmission bandwidth and the distribution
of node available computing resources. Besides a illustrative example was
provided, to verify the calculated reliability of the designed service
deployment plan, the NS3 is utilized along with Google cluster data set for

task for the task-driven approach TRNR. TRNR allows neural networks to learn
from numerous N-frequency-K-shot learning tasks, rather than from a large
amount of data. To verify the effectiveness of TRNR, we build a Multi-Scale
Residual Network (MSResNet) for both image rain removal and Gaussian noise
removal. Specifically, we train MSResNet for image rain removal and noise
removal with a few images (for example, 20.0\% train-set of Rain100H).
Experimental results demonstrate that TRNR enables MSResNet to learn more
effectively when data is scarce. TRNR has also been shown in experiments to
improve the performance of existing methods. Furthermore, MSResNet trained with
a few images using TRNR outperforms most recent deep learning methods trained
data-driven on large labeled datasets. These experimental results have
confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed TRNR. The source

Traveling Salesman Problem to minimize travel time and associated cost.
However, solutions stemming from this approach do not match the realized paths
as drivers deviate due to navigational considerations and preferences. To
prescribe routes that incorporate this tacit knowledge, a data-driven model is
proposed that aligns well with the hierarchical structure of delivery data
wherein each stop belongs to a zone - a geographical area. First, on the global
level, a zone sequence is established as a result of a minimization over a cost
matrix which is a weighted combination of historical information and distances
(travel times) between zones. Subsequently, within zones, sequences of stops
are determined, such that, integrated with the predetermined zone sequence, a
full solution is obtained.
  The methodology is particularly promising as it propels itself within the
top-tier of submissions to the Last-Mile Routing Research Challenge, while it
maintains an elegant decomposition that ensures a feasible implementation into
practice. The concurrence between prescribed and realized routes underpins the
adequateness of a hierarchical breakdown of the problem and the fact that
drivers make a series of locally optimal decisions when navigating.
Furthermore, experimenting with the balance between historical information and
distance exposes that historic information is pivotal in deciding a starting
zone of a route. The experiments also reveal that at the end of a route,
historical information can best be discarded, making the time it takes to
return to the station the primary concern.

challenge of high information loss, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance
in Top-K recommendation.
  In this work, we study the problem of representation learning for

Quantized Graph Convolutional Network (L^2Q-GCN). Different from previous work
that plugs quantization as the final encoder of user-item embeddings, L^2Q-GCN
learns the quantized representations whilst capturing the structural
information of user-item interaction graphs at different semantic levels. This
achieves the substantial retention of intermediate interactive information,
alleviating the feature smoothing issue for ranking caused by numerical
quantization. To further improve the model performance, we also present an
advanced solution named L^2Q-GCN-anl with quantization approximation and
annealing training strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on four
benchmarks over Top-K recommendation task. The experimental results show that,
with nearly 9x representation storage compression, L^2Q-GCN-anl attains about

shatters a $k$-set from $X$ if it appears in each of the $k!$ possible orders

  Our first main result concerns the case where our family must contain only
$t$ out of $k!$ of the possible orders. When $k=3$ we show that there are three

adaptation (UDA) improves classification performance on an unlabeled target
domain through explicit discrepancy minimization of data distribution or
adversarial learning. As an enhancement, category alignment is involved during
adaptation to reinforce target feature discrimination by utilizing model
prediction. However, there remain unexplored problems about pseudo-label
inaccuracy incurred by wrong category predictions on target domain, and
distribution deviation caused by overfitting on source domain. In this paper,
we propose a model-agnostic two-stage learning framework, which greatly reduces
flawed model predictions using soft pseudo-label strategy and avoids
overfitting on source domain with a curriculum learning strategy.
Theoretically, it successfully decreases the combined risk in the upper bound
of expected error on the target domain. At the first stage, we train a model

adaptively control the weighting between losses from the two domains so that
the focus of the training stage is gradually shifted from source distribution
to target distribution with prediction confidence boosted on the target domain.

assess DNN test inputs and steer input mutations. The coverage is characterized
via neurons having certain outputs, or the discrepancy between neuron outputs.
Nevertheless, recent research indicates that neuron coverage criteria show
little correlation with test suite quality.
  In general, DNNs approximate distributions, by incorporating hierarchical
layers, to make predictions for inputs. Thus, we champion to deduce DNN
behaviors based on its approximated distributions from a layer perspective. A
test suite should be assessed using its induced layer output distributions.
Accordingly, to fully examine DNN behaviors, input mutation should be directed
toward diversifying the approximated distributions.
  This paper summarizes eight design requirements for DNN coverage criteria,
taking into account distribution properties and practical concerns. We then
propose a new criterion, NeuraL Coverage (NLC), that satisfies all design
requirements. NLC treats a single DNN layer as the basic computational unit
(rather than a single neuron) and captures four critical properties of neuron
output distributions. Thus, NLC accurately describes how DNNs comprehend inputs
via approximated distributions. We demonstrate that NLC is significantly
correlated with the diversity of a test suite across a number of tasks
(classification and generation) and data formats (image and text). Its capacity
to discover DNN prediction errors is promising. Test input mutation guided by
NLC results in a greater quality and diversity of exposed erroneous behaviors.

taxonomy to classify the 70 papers in this survey. Subsequently, the papers
were assessed in terms of genetic optimization design. Finally, the benefits

hamper chain alignment in the initial slow flow, but, on the other hand,
facilitate chain stretching at low specific work at later, high rates. We
identify a minimum in the critical specific work at a strain rate just above

information age, gave us a theory of communications that quantified an ""amount
of information,"" but, as he pointed out, ""no concept of information itself was
defined."" Logical entropy provides that definition. Logical entropy is the
natural measure of the notion of information based on distinctions,
differences, distinguishability, and diversity. It is the (normalized)
quantitative measure of the distinctions of a partition on a set--just as the
Boole-Laplace logical probability is the normalized quantitative measure of the
elements of a subset of a set. And partitions and subsets are mathematically
dual concepts--so the logic of partitions is dual in that sense to the usual
Boolean logic of subsets, and hence the name ""logical entropy."" The logical
entropy of a partition has a simple interpretation as the probability that a
distinction or dit (elements in different blocks) is obtained in two
independent draws from the underlying set. The Shannon entropy is shown to also
be based on this notion of information-as-distinctions; it is the average
minimum number of binary partitions (bits) that need to be joined to make all
the same distinctions of the given partition. Hence all the concepts of simple,
joint, conditional, and mutual logical entropy can be transformed into the
corresponding concepts of Shannon entropy by a uniform non-linear dit-bit
transform. And finally logical entropy linearizes naturally to the
corresponding quantum concept. The quantum logical entropy of an observable
applied to a state is the probability that two different eigenvalues are
obtained in two independent projective measurements of that observable on that
state.

quantum-computer simulations, must be taken into account in the formalism for
extracting scattering observables. One approach is to work with a non-zero $i
\epsilon$-prescription in the Fourier transform to definite momentum and then
to estimate an ordered double limit, in which the spacetime volume is sent to
infinity before $\epsilon$ is sent to $0$. For the amplitudes and parameters
considered here, we find that significant volume effects arise, making the
required limit very challenging. We present a practical solution to this
challenge that may allow for future determinations of deeply virtual Compton
scattering amplitudes, as well as many other reactions that are presently
outside the scope of standard lattice QCD calculations.

Dynamic Line-Image Shearing Interferometer (DL-ISI), which uses a streak camera
to record optical fringes of displacement-gradient vs time profile along a line

growth processes in plate-impact experiments. Then, we present a convolutional
neural network (CNN) based deep-learning framework, trained by extensive
finite-element simulations, that inversely determines the accurate DCPs from
the DL-ISI fringe images. For the measurements, plate-impact experiments were
performed on a set of samples with a mid-plane crack. A Conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (cGAN) was employed first to reconstruct missing DL-ISI
fringes with recorded partial DL-ISI fringes. Then, the CNN and a correlation
method were applied to the fully reconstructed fringes to get the dynamic
fracture toughness, 12.1kJ/m^2, cohesive strength, 302 MPa, and maximum
cohesive separation, 80.5 um, within 0.4%, 2.7%, and 2.2% differences,
respectively. For the first time, the DCPs of polyurea have been successfully
obtained by the DL-ISI with the pre-trained CNN and correlation analyses of
cGAN-reconstructed data sets. The dynamic cohesive strength is found to be
nearly three times higher than the dynamic-failure-initiation strength. The
high dynamic fracture toughness is found to stem from both high dynamic
cohesive strength and high ductility of the dynamic cohesive separation.

2021), a generalized quasilinear (GQL) approximation is studied in turbulent
channel flow using a flow decomposition defined with spanwise Fourier modes:
the flow is decomposed into a set of low-wavenumber spanwise Fourier modes and
the rest high-wavenumber modes. This decomposition leads to the nonlinear
low-wavenumber group that supports the self-sustaining process within the given
integral length scales, whereas the linearised high-wavenumber group is not
able to do so, unlike the GQL models in Part 1 which place a minimal
mathematical description for the self-sustaining process across all integral
scales. Despite the important physical difference, it is shown that the GQL
models in this study share some similarities with those in Part 1: i.e. the
reduced multi-scale behaviour and anisotropic turbulent fluctuations.
Furthermore, despite not being able to support the self-sustaining process in
the high-wavenumber group, the GQL models in the present study are found to
reproduce some key statistical features in the high-wavenumber group solely
through the `scattering' mechanism proposed by previous studies. Finally, using
the nature of the GQL approximation, a set of numerical experiments suppressing
certain triadic nonlinear interactions are further carried out. This unveils
some key roles played by the certain types of triadic interactions including
energy cascade and inverse energy transfer in the near-wall region. In
particular, the inhibition of inverse energy transfer in the spanwise direction
leads to suppression of the near-wall positive turbulent transport at large
scales.

maximum-likelihood decoders require an explicit error model for Pauli errors to
decode a specific syndrome, whereas lower-threshold heuristic approaches such
as minimum weight matching are ""error agnostic"". Here we consider an
intermediate approach, formulating a decoder that depends on the bias, i.e.,
the relative probability of phase-flip to bit-flip errors, but is agnostic to
error rate. Our decoder is based on counting the number and effective weight of
the most likely error chains in each equivalence class of a given syndrome. We
use Metropolis-based Monte Carlo sampling to explore the space of error chains
and find unique chains, that are efficiently identified using a hash table.
Using the error-rate invariance the decoder can sample chains effectively at an
error rate which is higher than the physical error rate and without the need
for ""thermalization"" between chains in different equivalence classes. Applied
to the surface code and the XZZX code, the decoder matches maximum-likelihood
decoders for moderate code sizes or low error rates. We anticipate that,
because of the compressed information content per syndrome, it can be taken
full advantage of in combination with machine-learning methods to extrapolate

(GWs) from the merger of black-hole-neutron-star (BHNS) binary systems GW200105

While the mass ratio and BH spin in both systems were not sufficient to tidally
disrupt the NS outside of the BH event horizon, other, magnetospheric
mechanisms for EM emission exist in this regime and depend sensitively on the
NS magnetic field strength. Combining GW measurements with EM flux upper
limits, we place upper limits on the NS surface magnetic field strength above
which magnetospheric emission models would have generated an observable EM
counterpart. We consider fireball models powered by the black-hole battery
mechanism, where energy is output in gamma-rays over $\lesssim1$~second.
Consistency with no detection by Fermi-GBM or INTEGRAL SPI-ACS constrains the
NS surface magnetic field to $\lesssim10^{15}$~G. Hence, joint GW detection and
EM upper limits rule out the theoretical possibility that the NSs in GW200105
and GW200115, and the putative NS in GW190814, retain $\gtrsim10^{15}$~G
dipolar magnetic fields until merger. They also rule out formation scenarios
where strongly magnetized magnetars quickly merge with BHs. We alternatively
rule out operation of the BH-battery powered fireball mechanism in these
systems. This is the first multi-messenger constraint on NS magnetic fields in
BHNS systems and a novel approach to probe fields at this point in NS
evolution. This demonstrates the constraining power that multi-messenger

current analysis scheme overcomes those challenges by conducting three levels
of clustering analysis. On the event level, mixture-model fitting is employed
to distinguish between abnormally short and normal assessment attempts and
study events. On the module level, trace level clustering is performed with
three different methods for generating distance metrics between traces, with
the best performing output used in the next step. On the sequence level, trace
level clustering is performed on top of module-level clusters to reveal
students' change of learning strategy over time. We demonstrated that distance
metrics generated based on learning theory produced better clustering results
than pure data-driven or hybrid methods. The analysis showed that most students
started the semester with productive learning strategies, but a significant
fraction shifted to a multitude of less productive strategies in response to
increasing content difficulty and stress. The observations could prompt
instructors to rethink conventional course structure and implement
interventions to improve self-regulation at optimal times.

  Biomedical Imaging (MELBA)",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The positive outcome of a trauma intervention depends on an intraoperative
evaluation of inserted metallic implants. Due to occurring metal artifacts, the
quality of this evaluation heavily depends on the performance of so-called
Metal Artifact Reduction methods (MAR). The majority of these MAR methods
require prior segmentation of the inserted metal objects. Therefore, typically
a rather simple thresholding-based segmentation method in the reconstructed 3D
volume is applied, despite some major disadvantages. With this publication, the
potential of shifting the segmentation task to a learning-based,
view-consistent 2D projection-based method on the downstream MAR's outcome is
investigated. For segmenting the present metal, a rather simple learning-based
2D projection-wise segmentation network that is trained using real data
acquired during cadaver studies, is examined. To overcome the disadvantages
that come along with a 2D projection-wise segmentation, a Consistency Filter is
proposed. The influence of the shifted segmentation domain is investigated by
comparing the results of the standard fsMAR with a modified fsMAR version using
the new segmentation masks. With a quantitative and qualitative evaluation on
real cadaver data, the investigated approach showed an increased MAR
performance and a high insensitivity against metal artifacts. For cases with
metal outside the reconstruction's FoV or cases with vanishing metal, a
significant reduction in artifacts could be shown. Thus, increases of up to
roughly 3 dB w.r.t. the mean PSNR metric over all slices and up to 9 dB for
single slices were achieved. The shown results reveal a beneficial influence of
the shift to a 2D-based segmentation method on real data for downstream use
with a MAR method, like the fsMAR.

cathodoluminescence microscopy (PP-CL), a novel technique for studying
ultrafast dynamics in materials using combined excitation of electron and laser
pulses. The PP-CL setup is based on a commercial scanning electron microscope
combined with a femtosecond laser. Here we discuss the design, technical
details, and characterization of the PP-CL setup. The luminescence emitted by
the sample (either photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence or a combination of
both) can be analyzed in terms of spectrum, temporal statistics, and
frequency-modulated intensity (lock-in detection). The laser spot on the sample
is characterized by analyzing the changes in the secondary electron signal on a
GaN substrate, from which we extract a laser spot size in the $\mu m$ range.
While this method ensures spatial overlap of laser and electron pulses on the
sample, temporal alignment is achieved using time-correlated measurements of
photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence. We also discuss some considerations
to take into account when designing a PP-CL experiment, regarding temporal and
spatial resolution. This paper provides a detailed reference for the
development of any PP-CL microscope.

noteworthy that because of the nice parameterization of matrices in a Cholesky

  Design","19 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperbolic neural networks have been popular in the recent past due to their
ability to represent hierarchical data sets effectively and efficiently. The
challenge in developing these networks lies in the nonlinearity of the
embedding space namely, the Hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic space is a homogeneous
Riemannian manifold of the Lorentz group. Most existing methods (with some
exceptions) use local linearization to define a variety of operations
paralleling those used in traditional deep neural networks in Euclidean spaces.
In this paper, we present a novel fully hyperbolic neural network which uses
the concept of projections (embeddings) followed by an intrinsic aggregation
and a nonlinearity all within the hyperbolic space. The novelty here lies in
the projection which is designed to project data on to a lower-dimensional
embedded hyperbolic space and hence leads to a nested hyperbolic space
representation independently useful for dimensionality reduction. The main
theoretical contribution is that the proposed embedding is proved to be
isometric and equivariant under the Lorentz transformations. This projection is
computationally efficient since it can be expressed by simple linear
operations, and, due to the aforementioned equivariance property, it allows for
weight sharing. The nested hyperbolic space representation is the core
component of our network and therefore, we first compare this ensuing nested
hyperbolic space representation with other dimensionality reduction methods
such as tangent PCA, principal geodesic analysis (PGA) and HoroPCA. Based on
this equivariant embedding, we develop a novel fully hyperbolic graph
convolutional neural network architecture to learn the parameters of the
projection. Finally, we present experiments demonstrating comparative
performance of our network on several publicly available data sets.

  Q-Network Combined Approach for Critical Node Detection Problems","10 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Detecting critical nodes in sparse networks is important in a variety of
application domains. A Critical Node Problem (CNP) aims to find a set of
critical nodes from a network whose deletion maximally degrades the pairwise
connectivity of the residual network. Due to its general NP-hard nature,
state-of-the-art CNP solutions are based on heuristic approaches. Domain
knowledge and trial-and-error are usually required when designing such
approaches, thus consuming considerable effort and time. This work proposes a
feature importance-aware graph attention network for node representation and
combines it with dueling double deep Q-network to create an end-to-end
algorithm to solve CNP for the first time. It does not need any
problem-specific knowledge or labeled datasets as required by most of existing
methods. Once the model is trained, it can be generalized to cope with various
types of CNPs (with different sizes and topological structures) without
re-training. Extensive experiments on 28 real-world networks show that the
proposed method is highly comparable to state-of-the-art methods. It does not
require any problem-specific knowledge and, hence, can be applicable to many
applications including those impossible ones by using the existing approaches.
It can be combined with some local search methods to further improve its
solution quality. Extensive comparison results are given to show its
effectiveness in solving CNP.

structures such as RNN, LSTM, and GRU were proposed to model the fault
diagnosis effectively. However, these models are restricted by their serial

parallel CNN is difficult to implement fault diagnosis in an efficient way
because it requires larger convolution kernels or deep structure to achieve
long-term feature extraction capabilities. Besides, BERT model applies absolute
position embedding to introduce contextual information to the model, which
would bring noise to the raw data and therefore cannot be applied to fault
diagnosis directly. In order to address the above problems, a fault diagnosis
model named deep parallel time-series relation network(DPTRN) has been proposed
in this paper. There are mainly three advantages for DPTRN: (1) Our proposed
time relationship unit is based on full multilayer perceptron(MLP) structure,
therefore, DPTRN performs fault diagnosis in a parallel way and improves
computing efficiency significantly. (2) By improving the absolute position
embedding, our novel decoupling position embedding unit could be applied on the
fault diagnosis directly and learn contextual information. (3) Our proposed
DPTRN has obvious advantage in feature interpretability. We confirm the effect
of the proposed method on four datasets, and the results show the
effectiveness, efficiency and interpretability of the proposed DPTRN model.

prior work cannot precisely control the binary weight distribution during
training, and therefore cannot guarantee maximum entropy. Here, we show that
quantizing using optimal transport can guarantee any bit ratio, including equal
ratios. We investigate experimentally that equal bit ratios are indeed
preferable and show that our method leads to optimization benefits. We show
that our quantization method is effective when compared to state-of-the-art

  for Stock Price Prediction",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we are going to develop a natural language processing model to
help us to predict stocks in the long term. The whole network includes two
modules. The first module is a natural language processing model which seeks
out reliable factors from input reports. While the other is a time-series
forecasting model which takes the factors as input and aims to predict stocks
earnings yield. To indicate the efficiency of our model to combine the
sentiment analysis module and the time-series forecasting module, we name our
method ESAN.

negative feedback. Its automatic identification, especially on social media, is
a challenging task as it should be done on a large number of continuously
evolving posts, covering a large variety of topics. Most of the existing
approaches rely on the graph structure of a topic-discussion and/or the content
of messages. This paper proposes a controversy detection approach based on both
graph structure of a discussion and text features. Our proposed approach relies
on Graph Neural Network (gnn) to encode the graph representation (including its
texts) in an embedding vector before performing a graph classification task.
The latter will classify the post as controversial or not. Two controversy
detection strategies are proposed. The first one is based on a hierarchical
graph representation learning. Graph user nodes are embedded hierarchically and
iteratively to compute the whole graph embedding vector. The second one is
based on the attention mechanism, which allows each user node to give more or
less importance to its neighbors when computing node embeddings. We conduct
experiments to evaluate our approach using different real-world datasets.
Conducted experiments show the positive impact of combining textual features
and structural information in terms of performance.

  Supergravity","18 pages",,,,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The 1.5 order formalism (sometimes called a `trick') is the cornerstone of
modern supergravity. In this paper, the free massive Wess--Zumino theory is
used as a simple toy model to look at the BRS symmetry of the first, second and
1.5 order formalisms. This easily shows that the 1.5 order formalism is flawed
for all theories. The 1.5 algebra naively appears to close. However, when it is
analyzed in detail, in a simple model, where easy calculations are available,
the 1.5 formalism always generates an invalid BRS operator, which is not even
nilpotent. This clearly is also the case for supergravity. It follows that a
revised and completed set of nilpotent first order supergravity transformations
is needed to properly understand 3+1 dimensional supergravity. Such a set seems
easy to write down, by simply adding two more auxiliary fields so that the spin
connection becomes part of a super--YM multiplet.

  Energy Eco-Feedback Programs",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  According to research, reducing consumer energy demand through behavioural
interventions is an important factor of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and climate change.On this basis, feedback interventions that make
energy consumption and conservation efforts apparent are seen as a feasible
method for increasing energy-saving habits. Simulation techniques provide a
convenient and cost-effective tool for examining the parameters that may affect
the amount of energy saved as a result of such interventions. However,
constructing a reliable model that accurately represents real-world processes
is a significant issue. Five Opinion Dynamic (OD) models that depict how
opinion change occurs among individuals interactions are investigated in this
paper, and a Revised OD (ROD) model is suggested to develop more efficient
eco-feedback simulation models. The results show that the influence condition
and the weight-factor of connected opinions have a substantial impact on the
accuracy of simulation outputs when compared to field experiment reports. As a
result, ROD has been proposed for eco-feedback program simulations, as it
provides the nearest approximation to the field data.

  conclusions, section about time reversal added, some formulas added at the
  end of section 9, typos corrected",,,"UWThPh-2021-14","hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In these notes we first review Pauli's proof of his `fundamental theorem'
that states the equivalence of any two sets of Dirac matrices $\{ \gamma^\mu
\}$. Due to this theorem not only all physical results in the context of the
Dirac equation have to be independent of the basis chosen for the Dirac
matrices, but it should also be possible to obtain the results without
resorting to a specific basis in the course of the computation. Indeed, we
demonstrate this in the case of the behaviour of Dirac spinors under Lorentz
transformations, the quantization of the Dirac field, the expectation value of
the spin operator and several other topics. In particular, we emphasize the
totally different physics and mathematics background of the matrix $\beta$,
used in the definition of the conjugate Dirac spinor, and $\gamma^0$. Finally,
we compare the basis-independent manipulations with those performed in the Weyl
basis of Dirac matrices. The present notes provide a self-contained
introduction to the Dirac theory by solely exploiting the simplicity of the
Dirac algebra and the power of Pauli's Theorem.
