has been ineffective. Because of the whiteout phenomenon, multiple accidents
with 17 casualties occurred, and 134 vehicles were stacked up for 10 hours over

to freeze. CCTV images on the road surface have the advantage that we enable to
monitor the status of major points at the same time. Road managers are required
to make decisions on road closures and snow removal work owing to the road
surface conditions even at night. In parallel, they would provide road users to
alert for hazardous road surfaces. This paper propose a method to automate a
snow hazard indicator that the road surface region is generated from the night

automatically compute how much the night road surface is covered with snow. We
demonstrate several results applied to the cold and snow region in the winter

experimental unit affects another experimental unit's outcome, has received
considerable attention in standard randomized experiments. The complications
produced by population interference in this setting are now readily recognized,
and partial remedies are well known. Much less understood is the impact of
population interference in panel experiments where treatment is sequentially
randomized in the population, and the outcomes are observed at each time step.
This paper proposes a general framework for studying population interference in
panel experiments and presents new finite population estimation and inference
results. Our findings suggest that, under mild assumptions, the addition of a
temporal dimension to an experiment alleviates some of the challenges of
population interference for certain estimands. In contrast, we show that the
presence of carryover effects -- that is, when past treatments may affect
future outcomes -- exacerbates the problem. Revisiting the special case of
standard experiments with population interference, we prove a central limit
theorem under weaker conditions than previous results in the literature and
highlight the trade-off between flexibility in the design and the interference
structure.

reflection problem is crucial in the context of stellar or planetary
atmosphere. However, the atmospheric emission effect was not taken into account
in this model, and the solutions are applicable only for diffusely scattering
atmosphere in absence of emission.
  Aim: We extend the model of semi-infinite diffuse reflection problem by
including the effects of thermal emission B(T ), and present how this affects
Chandrasekhar's analytical end results. Hence, we aim to generalize
Chandrasekhar's model to provide a complete picture of this problem.
  Method: We use Invariance Principle Method to find the radiative transfer
equation accurate for diffuse reflection in presence of B(T ). Then we derive
the modified scattering function S(${\mu},{\phi}; {\mu}_0 , {\phi}_0$ ) for
different kind of phase functions.
  Results: We find that, the scattering function S(${\mu}, {\phi}; {\mu}_0 ,
{\phi}_0$ ) as well as diffusely reflected specific intensity $I(0, {\mu};
{\mu}_0 )$ for different phase functions are modified due to the emission
$B(T)$ from layer ${\tau} = 0$. In both cases, B(T) is added to the results of
only scattering case derived by Chandrasekhar, with some multiplicative
factors. Thus the diffusely reflected spectra will be enriched and carries the
temperature information of ${\tau} = 0$ layer. As the effects are additive in
nature, hence our model reduces to the sub-case of Chandrasekhar's scattering
model in case of $B(T) = 0$. We conclude that our generalized model provides
more accurate results due to the inclusion of the thermal emission effect in
Chandrasekhar's semi-infinite atmosphere problem.

(partially) hosting a service at the edge as a combination of the latency in
serving requests, the bandwidth consumption, and the time-varying cost for
renting edge resources. We propose an online policy called
$\alpha$-RetroRenting ($\alpha$-RR) which dynamically determines the fraction
of the service to be hosted at the edge in any time-slot, based on the history
of the request arrivals and the rent cost sequence. As our main result, we
derive an upper bound on $\alpha$-RR's competitive ratio with respect to the
offline optimal policy that knows the entire request arrival and rent cost
sequence in advance. We conduct extensive numerical evaluations to compare the
performance of $\alpha$-RR with various benchmarks for synthetic and

propose a simple uniform sampling framework for solving three representative

clustering with outliers. Our analysis is fundamentally different from the
previous (uniform and non-uniform) sampling based ideas. To explain the
effectiveness of uniform sampling in theory, we introduce a measure of

significance degree of the given instance. In particular, the sample size can
be independent of the input data size $n$ and the dimensionality $d$, if we
assume the given instance is ""significant"", which is in fact a fairly
reasonable assumption in practice. Due to its simplicity, the uniform sampling
approach also enjoys several significant advantages over the non-uniform
sampling approaches in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work that systematically studies the effectiveness of uniform sampling

warm dust that may stem from recent giant impacts between planetary embryos
during the final phases of terrestrial planet growth. Here we report on the
identification and characterization of six new EDDs. These disks surround F5-G9
type main-sequence stars with ages >100 Myr, have dust temperatures higher than
300K and fractional luminosities between 0.01 and 0.07. Using time-domain
photometric data at 3.4 and 4.6$\mu$m from the WISE all sky surveys, we
conclude that four of these disks exhibited variable mid-infrared emission
between 2010 and 2019. Analyzing the sample of all known EDDs, now expanded to
17 objects, we find that 14 of them showed changes at 3-5$\mu$m over the past
decade suggesting that mid-infrared variability is an inherent characteristic
of EDDs. We also report that wide-orbit pairs are significantly more common in
EDD systems than in the normal stellar population. While current models of
rocky planet formation predict that the majority of giant collisions occur in
the first 100 Myr, we find that the sample of EDDs is dominated by systems
older than this age. This raises the possibility that the era of giant impacts
may be longer than we think, or that some other mechanism(s) can also produce
EDDs. We examine a scenario where the observed warm dust stems from the
disruption and/or collisions of comets delivered from an outer reservoir into
the inner regions, and explore what role the wide companions could play in this
process.

injection into gas, investigating the interactions of cavitation in the nozzle,
primary jet breakup, mass-flow rates, and gas entrainment. During strong
cavitation, detached vapor structures can reach the nozzle outlet, leading to
partial entrainment of gas from the outflow region into the nozzle. The gas
entrainment can affect cavitation dynamics, mass-flow rates, and jet breakup.
Moreover, the implosion of detached vapor structures induces pressure peaks
that on the one hand amplify turbulent fluctuations and subsequently can
enhance jet breakup and on the other hand can damage walls in the proximity and
thus lead to cavitation erosion.
  Our numerical setup is based on a reference experiment, in which liquid water
is discharged into ambient air through a step nozzle. The cavitating liquid and
the non-condensable gas phase are modeled with a barotropic homogeneous mixture
model while for the numerical model a high-order implicit large eddy approach
is employed. Full compressibility of all components is taken into account,
enabling us to capture the effects of collapsing vapor structures. Two
operating points covering different cavitation regimes and jet characteristics
are investigated. Special emphasis is placed on studying the effects of
cavitation on the mass flow and the jet as well as the impact of partial gas
entrainment. Therefore, frequency analyses of the recorded time-resolved
signals are performed. Furthermore, the dynamics and intensities of imploding
vapor structures are assessed.

across multiple programming models/methodologies using a simple, but
nontrivial, mathematical kernel. This kernel has been derived from the MILC
lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) code. SU3\_Bench is bandwidth bound and
generates regular compute and data access patterns. Therefore, on most
traditional CPU and GPU-based systems, its performance is mainly determined by
the achievable memory bandwidth. Although SU3\_Bench is a simple kernel,
experience says its subtleties require a certain amount of tweaking to achieve
peak performance for a given programming model and hardware, making performance
portability challenging. In this paper, we share some of the challenges in
obtaining the peak performance for SU3\_Bench on a state-of-the-art Intel Xeon
machine, due to the nuances of variable definition, the nature of
compiler-provided default constructors, how memory is accessed at object
creation time, and the NUMA effects on the machine. We discuss how to tackle
those challenges to improve SU3\_Bench's performance by \(2\times\) compared to
the original OpenMP implementation available at Github. This provides a
valuable lesson for other similar kernels.
  Expanding on the performance portability aspects, we also show early results
obtained porting SU3\_Bench to the new Intel Programmable Integrated Unified
Memory Architecture (PIUMA), characterized by a more balanced flops-to-byte
ratio. This paper shows that it is not the usual bandwidth or flops, rather the
pipeline throughput, that determines SU3\_Bench's performance on PIUMA.
Finally, we show how to improve performance on PIUMA and how that compares with
the performance on Xeon, which has around one order of magnitude more
flops-per-byte.

understanding in robotic minimally invasive surgery. Although robotic systems
can potentially directly provide joint values, this information is not commonly
exploited inside the operating room, due to its possible unreliability, limited
access and the time-consuming calibration required, especially for continuum
robots. For this reason, standard approaches for 3-D pose estimation involve
the use of external tracking systems. Recently, image-based methods have
emerged as promising, non-invasive alternatives. While many image-based
approaches in the literature have shown accurate results, they generally
require either a complex iterative optimization for each processed image,
making them unsuitable for real-time applications, or a large number of
manually-annotated images for efficient learning. In this paper we propose a
self-supervised image-based method, exploiting, at training time only, the
imprecise kinematic information provided by the robot. In order to avoid

auto-encoder, smartly bottlenecked by the presence of a physical model of the
robotic instruments and surgical camera, forcing a separation between image

and vulnerability propagation analysis. Generating call graphs in an efficient
manner can be a challenging task when it comes to high-level languages that are
modular and incorporate dynamic features and higher-order functions.
  Despite the language's popularity, there have been very few tools aiming to
generate call graphs for Python programs. Worse, these tools suffer from
several effectiveness issues that limit their practicality in realistic
programs. We propose a pragmatic, static approach for call graph generation in
Python. We compute all assignment relations between program identifiers of
functions, variables, classes, and modules through an inter-procedural
analysis. Based on these assignment relations, we produce the resulting call
graph by resolving all calls to potentially invoked functions. Notably, the
underlying analysis is designed to be efficient and scalable, handling several
Python features, such as modules, generators, function closures, and multiple
inheritance.
  We have evaluated our prototype implementation, which we call PyCG, using two
benchmarks: a micro-benchmark suite containing small Python programs and a set
of macro-benchmarks with several popular real-world Python packages. Our
results indicate that PyCG can efficiently handle thousands of lines of code in
less than a second (0.38 seconds for 1k LoC on average). Further, it
outperforms the state-of-the-art for Python in both precision and recall: PyCG
achieves high rates of precision ~99.2%, and adequate recall ~69.9%. Finally,
we demonstrate how PyCG can aid dependency impact analysis by showcasing a
potential enhancement to GitHub's ""security advisory"" notification service
using a real-world example.

individual's probability of getting infected but comes at a cost. It creates a
single-peaked epidemic, flattens the curve and decreases the size of the
epidemic. We examine more closely the effects of distancing on the outset, the
peak and the final size of the epidemic. First, we define a behavioral basic
reproduction number and show that it is concave in the transmission rate. The
infection, therefore, spreads only if the transmission rate is in the
intermediate region. Second, the peak of the epidemic is non-monotonic in the
transmission rate. A reduction in the transmission rate can lead to an increase
of the peak. On the other hand, a decrease in the cost of distancing always
flattens the curve. Third, both an increase in the infection rate as well as an
increase in the cost of distancing increase the size of the epidemic. Our
results have important implications on the modeling of interventions. Imposing
restrictions on the infection rate has qualitatively different effects on the
trajectory of the epidemics than imposing assumptions on the cost of
distancing. The interventions that affect interactions rather than the
transmission rate should, therefore, be modeled as changes in the cost of

provide high efficiency in the imitation of the synaptic connection due to its

the texture and hardness of the object in contact and is robust to illumination
and colour variances. However, due to the limited sensing area and the
resistance of the fixed surface, current tactile sensors have to tap the
tactile sensor on target object many times when assessing a large surface,
i.e., pressing, lifting up and shifting to another region. This process is
ineffective and time consuming. It is also undesirable to drag such sensors as
this often damages the sensitive membrane of the sensor or the object. To
address these problems, we propose a cylindrical optical tactile sensor named
TouchRoller that can roll around its center axis. It maintains being in contact
with the assessed surface throughout the entire motion, which allows for
measuring the object continuously and effectively. Extensive experiments show
that the TouchRoller sensor can cover a textured surface of 8cm*11cm in a short
time of 10s, much more effectively than a flat optical tactile sensor (in
196s). The reconstructed map of the texture from the collected tactile images
has a high Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.31 on average, when compared
with the visual texture. In addition, the contacts on the sensor can be
localised with a low localisation error, 2.63mm in the center regions and
7.66mm on average. The proposed sensor will enable the fast assessment of large
surfaces with high-resolution tactile sensing, and also the effective

pseudo-observation calculation and propensity score estimation. This allows
valid and computationally efficient inference without resampling. We also prove
the optimal efficiency property of the overlap weights within the class of

the vertices x and y. The set W is an adjacency resolving set for G if distinct
vertices of G have distinct adjacency representations with respect to W. The
minimum cardinality of an adjacency resolving set for G is its adjacency
dimension. It is clear that the adjacency dimension of an n-vertex graph G is
between 1 and n-1. The graphs with adjacency dimension 1 and n-1 are known. All
graphs with adjacency dimension 2, and all n-vertex graphs with adjacency
dimension n-2 are studied in this paper. In terms of the diameter and order of
G, a sharp upper bound is found for adjacency dimension of G. Also, a sharp
lower bound for adjacency dimension of G is obtained in terms of order of G.
Using these two bounds, all graphs with adjacency dimension 2, and all n-vertex
graphs with adjacency dimension n-2 are characterized.

discover new thermodynamically stable materials with high band gap (SrYF$_5$)

to train effective screening models for filtering out materials with desired

NGGs are formulations that utilize metal powders as a fuel and oxides or
hydroxides as oxidizers that can rapidly release large amount of heat and
gaseous products to generate shock waves. The heat and pressure discharge,
impact sensitivity, long term stability and other critical properties depend on
the particle size and shape, as well as assembling procedure and intermixing
degree between the components. The extremely high energy density and the
ability to tune the dynamic properties of the energetic system makes NGGs ideal
candidates to dilute or replace traditional energetic materials for emerging
applications. In terms of energy density, performance and controllability of
dynamic properties, the energetic materials based on bismuth and iodine
compounds are exceptional among the NGGs. The thermodynamic calculations and
experimental study confirm that NGGs based on iodine and bismuth compounds
mixed with aluminum nanoparticles are the most powerful formulations to date

children organs are more sensitive to radiation than adults, due to their
growth rate. Therefore, evaluating the absorbed dose in children to avoid
irrecoverable damage is highly crucial. In this work, absorbed dose by
different organs of children within the SPECT imaging for the above-mentioned
radiopharmaceuticals were estimated through the use of Monte Carlo simulation
for patients at the ages of 4, 8, 11, and 14-years old. The patients absorbed
dose was estimated based on the specific radiopharmaceutical uptake patterns
and the age-related human body models. To this end, we used the University of

pediatric patients at 4, 8, 11, and 14 years of age. The accuracy of the
dosimetric outcomes was evaluated versus the ICRP 128 data. The highest and
lowest doses absorbed by the kidneys were 0.48 mGy-MBq and 0.0042 mGy-MBq
obtained for 4-year-old and 14-year-old children using 99mTc-DMSA and

by kidneys and when 99mTc-DMSA was used. The highest and lowest absorbed dose
in the organs occurs when 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-MAG3 (in normal renal function)
are used, respectively. On the other hand, the results indicated that the dose

molecular heterogeneity of cancer, expanding what was known from single-cancer

limited in their ability to use information from multiple sources of data
(e.g., omics platforms) and multiple sample sets (e.g., cancer types) to
predict important clinical outcomes, like overall survival. We address the
issue of prediction across multiple high-dimensional sources of data and
multiple sample sets by using exploratory results from BIDIFAC+, a method for
integrative dimension reduction of bidimensionally-linked matrices, in a
predictive model. We apply a Bayesian hierarchical model that performs variable
selection using spike-and-slab priors which are modified to allow for the
borrowing of information across clustered data. This method is used to predict
overall patient survival from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using data from 29
cancer types and 4 omics sources. Our model selected patterns of variation
identified by BIDIFAC+ that differentiate clinical tumor subtypes with markedly
different survival outcomes. We also use simulations to evaluate the
performance of the modified spike-and-slab prior in terms of its variable
selection accuracy and prediction accuracy under different underlying
data-generating frameworks. Software and code used for our analysis can be

with a client in the presence of multiple adversaries at unknown locations in
the environment. We assume that the client and the adversaries are located in
the far-field region, and all possible directions for each adversary can be
expressed as a continuous interval of directions. In such a setting, we develop
a periodic transmission strategy, i.e., a sequence of joint beamforming gain
and artificial noise pairs, that prevents the adversaries from decreasing their
uncertainty on the information sequence by eavesdropping on the transmission.
We formulate a series of nonconvex semi-infinite optimization problems to
synthesize the transmission strategy. We show that the semi-definite program
(SDP) relaxations of these nonconvex problems are exact under an efficiently
verifiable sufficient condition. We approximate the SDP relaxations, which are
subject to infinitely many constraints, by randomly sampling a finite subset of
the constraints and establish the probability with which optimal solutions to
the obtained finite SDPs and the semi-infinite SDPs coincide. We demonstrate
with numerical simulations that the proposed periodic strategy can ensure the
security of communication in scenarios in which all stationary strategies fail

approaches for big data analysis with memory constraints of computers.
Specifically, for the whole dataset with size $N$, $m_N$ subsamples are
randomly drawn, and each subsample with a subsample size $k_N\ll N$ to meet the
memory constraint is sampled uniformly without replacement. Aggregating the
estimators of $m_N$ subsamples can lead to subbagging estimation. To analyze
the theoretical properties of the subbagging estimator, we adapt the incomplete
$U$-statistics theory with an infinite order kernel to allow overlapping drawn
subsamples in the sampling procedure. Utilizing this novel theoretical
framework, we demonstrate that via a proper hyperparameter selection of $k_N$
and $m_N$, the subbagging estimator can achieve $\sqrt{N}$-consistency and
asymptotic normality under the condition $(k_Nm_N)/N\to \alpha \in (0,\infty]$.
Compared to the full sample estimator, we theoretically show that the
$\sqrt{N}$-consistent subbagging estimator has an inflation rate of $1/\alpha$
in its asymptotic variance. Simulation experiments are presented to demonstrate
the finite sample performances. An American airline dataset is analyzed to
illustrate that the subbagging estimate is numerically close to the full sample
estimate, and can be computationally fast under the memory constraint.

fundamental and can in principle be skipped for noncoercive problems, leading
to a cheaper online phase. Numerical applications in three scenarios from

study a problem in communications. Since then, there has been extensive
research on the distance matrices of graphs -- a 2014 survey by Aouchiche and
Hansen on spectra of distance matrices of graphs lists more than 150
references. In the last ten years, variants such as the distance Laplacian, the
distance signless Laplacian, and the normalized distance Laplacian matrix of a
graph have been studied. After a brief description of the early history of the
distance matrix and its motivating problem, this survey focuses on comparing
and contrasting techniques and results for the four types of distance matrices.
Digraphs are treated separately after the discussion of graphs, including
discussion of similarities and differences between graphs and digraphs. New
results are presented that complement existing results, including results for
some the matrices on unimodality of characteristic polynomials for graphs,
preservation of parameters by cospectrality for graphs, and bounds on spectral
radii for digraphs.

Global Positioning System (GPS) based on clock data behavior changes in a
higher-order derivative domain. Further, the time synchronization attack
rejection and mitigation based on sparse domain (TSARM-S) is presented. TSAs
affect stationary GPS receivers in applications where precise timing is
required, such as cellular communications, financial transactions, and
monitoring of the electric power grid. In the present work, the clock bias and
clock drift are monitored at higher-order clock data derivatives where the TSA
is seen as a sparse spike-like event. The smoothness of the attack relates to
the derivative order where the sparsity is observed. The proposed method
jointly estimates a dynamic solution for GPS timing and rejects behavior
changes based on such sparse events. An evaluation procedure is presented for
two testbeds, namely a commercial receiver and a software-defined radio.
Further, the proposed method is evaluated against distinct real-dataset Texas
Spoofing Test Battery (TEXBAT) scenarios. Combined synthetic and real-data
results show an average RMS clock bias error of 12.08 m for the SDR platform,
and 45.74 m for the commercial device. Further, the technique is evaluated
against state-of-the-art mitigation techniques and in a spoofing-plus-multipath
scenario for robustness. Finally, TSARM-S can be potentially optimized and
implemented in commercial devices via a firmware upgrade.

object to model its shape, using tactile sensors on robotic fingers, while also
improving finger placement to optimise grasp stability. In many situations, a
robot will have only a partial camera view of the near side of an observed
object, for which the far side remains occluded. We show how an initial grasp
attempt, based on an initial guess of the overall object shape, yields tactile
glances of the far side of the object which enable the shape estimate and
consequently the successive grasps to be improved. We propose a grasp
exploration approach using a probabilistic representation of shape, based on
Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces. This representation enables initial partial
vision data to be augmented with additional data from successive tactile
glances. This is combined with a probabilistic estimate of grasp quality to
refine grasp configurations. When choosing the next set of finger placements, a
bi-objective optimisation method is used to mutually maximise grasp quality and
improve shape representation during successive grasp attempts. Experimental
results show that the proposed approach yields stable grasp configurations more
efficiently than a baseline method, while also yielding improved shape estimate

this information is often unavailable, incomplete or outdated. The increasing

issue. This paper proposes a two-stage data-driven framework for distribution
grid modeling using SM data. In the first stage, we propose to identify the
topology via reconstructing a weighted Laplacian matrix of distribution
networks, which is mathematically proven to be robust against moderately
heterogeneous R/X profiles. In the second stage, we develop nonlinear least
absolute deviations (LAD) and least squares (LS) regression models to estimate
line impedances of single branches based on a nonlinear inverse power flow,
which is then embedded within a bottom-up sweep algorithm to achieve the
identification across the network in a branch-wise manner. Because the
estimation models are inherently non-convex programs and NP-hard, we specially
address their tractable convex relaxations and verify the exactness. In
addition, we design a conductor library to significantly narrow down the
solution space. Numerical results on the modified IEEE 13-bus, 37-bus and

gas in kpc-scale regions in nearby galaxies, using integral field spectroscopy
data from MaNGA MPL-9. We identify star-forming (HII) and diffuse ionized gas
(DIG) regions from MaNGA datacubes. From the stacked spectrum of each region,
we measure the stellar attenuation, $E(B-V)_{\rm star}$, using the technique
developed by Li et al.(2020), as well as the gas attenuation, $E(B-V)_{\rm
gas}$, from the Balmer decrement. We then examine the correlation of
$E(B-V)_{\rm star}$, $E(B-V)_{\rm gas}$, $E(B-V)_{\rm gas}-E(B-V)_{\rm star}$
and $E(B-V)_{\rm star}/E(B-V)_{\rm gas}$ with 16 regional/global properties,
and for regions with different $\rm H{\alpha}$ surface brightnesses
($\Sigma_{\rm H\alpha}$). We find a stronger correlation between $E(B-V)_{\rm
star}$ and $E(B-V)_{\rm gas}$ in regions of higher $\Sigma_{\rm H\alpha}$.
Luminosity-weighted age ($t_L$) is found to be the property that is the most
strongly correlated with $E(B-V)_{\rm star}$, and consequently with
$E(B-V)_{\rm gas}-E(B-V)_{\rm star}$ and $E(B-V)_{\rm star}/E(B-V)_{\rm gas}$.
At fixed $\Sigma_{\rm H\alpha}$, $\log_{10}t_L$ is linearly and negatively
correlated with $E(B-V)_{\rm star}/E(B-V)_{\rm gas}$ at all ages. Gas-phase
metallicity and ionization level are important for the attenuation in the gas.
Our results indicate that the ionizing source for DIG regions is likely

penalizing or normalizing weight matrices derived from concatenating or
flattening the convolutional kernels. These methods often destroy or ignore the
benign convolutional structure of the kernels; therefore, they are often
expensive or impractical for deep ConvNets. In contrast, we introduce a simple

plug-and-play module to be conveniently incorporated into any ConvNets. Our
method is inspired by recent work on preconditioning methods for convolutional
sparse coding and can effectively promote each layer's channel-wise isometry.
Furthermore, we show that our ConvNorm can reduce the layerwise spectral norm
of the weight matrices and hence improve the Lipschitzness of the network,
leading to easier training and improved robustness for deep ConvNets. Applied
to classification under noise corruptions and generative adversarial network

We propose a model that incorporates two important dynamically varying

increases with the number of infectious cases, while an increasing sense of
safety with increased vaccination lowers precautionary behaviors. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first model that can effectively reproduce the
complete time history of COVID-19 infections for various regions of the United
States and provides relatable measures of dynamic changes in the population
behavior and disease transmission rates. We propose a parameter d_I as a direct
measure of a population's caution against an infectious disease, that can be
obtained from the ongoing new infectious cases. The model provides a method for
quantitative measure of critical infectious disease attributes for a population
including highest disease transmission rate, effective disease transmission
rate, and disease related precautionary behavior. We predict future COVID-19
pandemic trends in the United States accounting for vaccine rollout and
behavioral response. Although a high rate of vaccination is critical to quickly
end the pandemic, we find that a return towards pre-pandemic social behavior
due to increased sense of safety during vaccine deployment, can cause an
alarming surge in infections. Our results indicate that at the current rate of
vaccination, the new infection cases for COVID-19 in the United States will
approach zero by the end of August 2021. The model can be used for predicting
future epidemic and pandemic dynamics before and during vaccination.

scale. This paper proposes a mathematical formalization of CLCA applied to a
territorial mobility change. The method is applied to quantify the impact on
climate change of the breakthrough of free-floating e-scooters (FFES) in Paris.
A FFES user survey is conducted to estimate the modal shifts due to FFES. Trip
substitutions from all the Parisian modes concerned are considered - personal
or shared bicycles and motor scooters, private car, taxi and ride-hailing, bus,
streetcar, metro and RER (the Paris metropolitan area mass rapid transit
system). All these Parisian modes are assessed for the first time using LCA.
Final results estimate that over one year, the FFES generated an extra thirteen
thousand tons of CO2eq under an assumption of one million users, mainly due to
major shifts coming from lower-emitting modes (60% from the metro and the RER,
22% from active modes). Recommendations are given to enhance their carbon
footprint. A scenario analysis shows that increasing the lifetime mileage is
insufficient to get a positive balance: reducing drastically servicing
emissions is also required. A sensitivity analysis switching the French
electricity mix for eleven other country mixes suggests a better climate change
effect of the FFES in similar metropolitan areas with higher electricity carbon
intensity, such as in Germany and China. Finally, the novelty and the limits of
the method are discussed, as well as the results and the role of e-scooters,
micromobility, and shared vehicles towards a sustainable mobility.

evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs), especially hierarchical SAEAs, have been shown

success of hierarchical SAEAs mainly profits from the potential benefit of
their global surrogate models known as ""blessing of uncertainty"" and the high

improvement on highdimensional problems since now it is still challenging to
build accurate enough local models due to the huge solution space. Directing
against this issue, this study proposes a new hierarchical SAEA by training
local surrogate models with the help of the random projection technique.
Instead of executing training in the original high-dimensional solution space,
the new algorithm first randomly projects training samples onto a set of
low-dimensional subspaces, then trains a surrogate model in each subspace, and
finally achieves evaluations of candidate solutions by averaging the resulting
models. Experimental results on six benchmark functions of 100 and 200

board game that requires players to make multiple decisions during the game.
Decision-making in Monopoly involves many real-world elements such as
strategizing, luck, and modeling of opponent's policies. In this paper, we
present novel representations for the state and action space for the full
version of Monopoly and define an improved reward function. Using these, we
show that our deep reinforcement learning agent can learn winning strategies
for Monopoly against different fixed-policy agents. In Monopoly, players can
take multiple actions even if it is not their turn to roll the dice. Some of
these actions occur more frequently than others, resulting in a skewed
distribution that adversely affects the performance of the learning agent. To
tackle the non-uniform distribution of actions, we propose a hybrid approach
that combines deep reinforcement learning (for frequent but complex decisions)
with a fixed policy approach (for infrequent but straightforward decisions).
Experimental results show that our hybrid agent outperforms a standard deep
reinforcement learning agent by 30% in the number of games won against
fixed-policy agents.

BGGs with magnitude gaps in the range 0-2.7 magnitudes, in order to investigate
any relation between luminosity gap and the radio properties of the BGG. In
order to eliminate selection biases, we ensure that all variations in stellar
mass are accounted for. We then confirm that, at fixed stellar mass, there are
no significant variations in the optical properties of the BGGs over the full
range of luminosity gaps studied. We compare these optical results with the

resources. The highly parallel neural networks portion of these models can
benefit from GPU acceleration however, large embedding tables often cannot fit
in the limited-capacity GPU device memory. Hence, this paper deep dives into
the semantics of training data and obtains insights about the feature access,
transfer, and usage patterns of these models. We observe that, due to the
popularity of certain inputs, the accesses to the embeddings are highly skewed
with a few embedding entries being accessed up to 10000x more. This paper
leverages this asymmetrical access pattern to offer a framework, called FAE,
and proposes a hot-embedding aware data layout for training recommender models.
This layout utilizes the scarce GPU memory for storing the highly accessed
embeddings, thus reduces the data transfers from CPU to GPU. At the same time,
FAE engages the GPU to accelerate the executions of these hot embedding
entries. Experiments on production-scale recommendation models with real
datasets show that FAE reduces the overall training time by 2.3x and 1.52x in
comparison to XDL CPU-only and XDL CPU-GPU execution while maintaining baseline
accuracy

membership in geopolitical coalitions shapes the decision to engage in
conflict. Such theories explain the ways in which nodal and dyadic
characteristics affect the evolution of conflict patterns over time via their

we develop a dynamic model of network data by combining a hidden Markov model

underlying the network structure. Unlike existing models, we incorporate
covariates that predict dynamic node memberships in latent groups as well as
the direct formation of edges between dyads. While prior substantive research
often assumes the decision to engage in international militarized conflict is
independent across states and static over time, we demonstrate that conflict is
driven by states' evolving membership in geopolitical blocs. Changes in monadic
covariates like democracy shift states between coalitions, generating
heterogeneous effects on conflict over time and across states. The proposed
methodology, which relies on a variational approximation to a collapsed
posterior distribution as well as stochastic optimization for scalability, is
implemented through an open-source software package.

breaches of users' sensitive data make the computation of SVD challenging.
Federated learning (FL) is a paradigm enabling a large number of devices to
jointly learn a model in a communication-efficient way without data sharing. In
the FL framework, we develop a class of algorithms called FedPower for the
computation of partial SVD in the modern setting. Based on the well-known power
method, the local devices alternate between multiple local power iterations and
one global aggregation to improve communication efficiency. In the aggregation,
we propose to weight each local eigenvector matrix with Orthogonal Procrustes
Transformation (OPT). Considering the practical stragglers' effect, the
aggregation can be fully participated or partially participated, where for the
latter we propose two sampling and aggregation schemes. Further, to ensure
strong privacy protection, we add Gaussian noise whenever the communication
happens by adopting the notion of differential privacy (DP). We theoretically
show the convergence bound for FedPower. The resulting bound is interpretable
with each part corresponding to the effect of Gaussian noise, parallelization,
and random sampling of devices, respectively. We also conduct experiments to
demonstrate the merits of FedPower. In particular, the local iterations not

Dukhin number, $\mathrm{Du}=|\sigma|/eRc\sim
|\sigma|\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}^{2}/eR$ ($\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ is the Debye
length), is an appropriate scaling parameter in the nanotube limit
($H\rightarrow\infty$). Decreasing the length of the nanopore, namely,
approaching the nanohole limit ($H\rightarrow 0$), an alternative scaling
parameter has been obtained that contains the pore length and is called the
modified Dukhin number: $\mathrm{mDu}\sim \mathrm{Du}\,
H/\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}\sim |\sigma|\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}H/eR$. We found that the
reason of non-linearity is that the double layers accumulating at the pore wall
in the radial dimension correlate with the double layers accumulating at the
entrances of the pore near the membrane on the two sides. Our modeling study
using the Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo method and the Poisson-Nernst-Planck
theory provides concentration, flux, and selectivity profiles, that show
whether the surface or the volume conduction dominates in a given region of the
nanopore for a given combination of the variables. We propose that the
inflection point of the scaling curve may be used to characterize the
transition point between the surface and volume conductions.

on the direct modulation of a large-modulation-bandwidth and narrow-linewidth

bichromatic light source and simplest CPT configuration, in which a circularly
polarized bichromatic laser interrogates the ^{87}Rb atom system, a CPT signal
of clock transition with a narrow linewidth and high contrast is observed. We
then lock the local oscillator frequency to the CPT error signal and
demonstrate a short-term frequency stability of 3.6 \times 10^{-13}

reconfigure the wireless environment in a controllable way. To compensate for
the double-fading attenuation in the RIS-aided link, a large number of passive
reflecting elements (REs) are conventionally deployed at the RIS, resulting in
large surface size and considerable circuit power consumption. In this paper,
we propose a new type of RIS, called active RIS, where each RE is assisted by
active loads (negative resistance), that reflect and amplify the incident
signal instead of only reflecting it with the adjustable phase shift as in the
case of a passive RIS. Therefore, for a given power budget at the RIS, a
strengthened RIS-aided link can be achieved by increasing the number of active
REs as well as amplifying the incident signal. We consider the use of an active
RIS to a single input multiple output (SIMO) system. {However, it would
unintentionally amplify the RIS-correlated noise, and thus the proposed system
has to balance the conflict between the received signal power maximization and
the RIS-correlated noise minimization at the receiver. To achieve this goal, it
has to optimize the reflecting coefficient matrix at the RIS and the receive
beamforming at the receiver.} An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed
to solve the problem. Specifically, the receive beamforming is obtained with a
closed-form solution based on linear minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)
criterion, while the reflecting coefficient matrix is obtained by solving a
series of sequential convex approximation (SCA) problems. Simulation results
show that the proposed active RIS-aided system could achieve better performance
over the conventional passive RIS-aided system with the same power budget.

Specifically, we present the first large-scale study to detect and characterize
the correlations between user comments and market policies. First, we propose
CHAMP, an approach that adopts text mining and natural language processing
(NLP) techniques to extract semantic rules through a semi-automated process,
and classifies comments into 26 pre-defined types of undesired behaviors that
violate market policies. Our evaluation on real-world user comments shows that
it achieves both high precision and recall ($>0.9$) in classifying comments for

undesired behavior comments in the wild. The results confirm our speculation
that user comments can be used to pinpoint suspicious apps that violate

(LCS) in the asymmetric streaming model, introduced by Saks and Seshadhri
[SS13]. As an intermediate model between the random access model and the
streaming model, this model allows one to have streaming access to one string
and random access to the other string.
  Our first main contribution is a systematic study of space lower bounds for
ED and LCS in the asymmetric streaming model. Previously, there are no
explicitly stated results in this context, although some lower bounds about LCS
can be inferred from the lower bounds for longest increasing subsequence (LIS)
in [SW07][GG10][EJ08]. Yet these bounds only work for large alphabet size. In
this paper, we develop several new techniques to handle ED in general and LCS
for small alphabet size, thus establishing strong lower bounds for both
problems. In particular, our lower bound for ED provides an exponential
separation between edit distance and Hamming distance in the asymmetric
streaming model. Our lower bounds also extend to LIS and longest non-decreasing
sequence (LNS) in the standard streaming model. Together with previous results,
our bounds provide an almost complete picture for these two problems.
  As our second main contribution, we give improved algorithms for ED and LCS
in the asymmetric streaming model. For ED, we improve the space complexity of
the constant factor approximation algorithms in [FHRS20][CJLZ20] from
$\tilde{O}(\frac{n^\delta}{\delta})$ to
$O(\frac{d^\delta}{\delta}\;\mathsf{polylog}(n))$, where $n$ is the length of

give the first $1/2+\epsilon$ approximation algorithm with space $n^{\delta}$

designing effective and refined personalized treatment strategies. It was
recently shown by us that such information can be inferred from the diffusion
parameter D derived from the diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) if a relation between
D and cell density can be established. However, such relation cannot a priori
be assumed to be constant for all patients and tumor types. Hence to assist in
clinical decisions in palliative settings, the relation needs to be established
without tumor resection. It is here demonstrated that biopsies may contain
sufficient information for this purpose if the localization of biopsies is
chosen as systematically elaborated in this paper. A superpixel-based method
for automated optimal localization of biopsies from the DWI D-map is proposed.
The performance of the DWI-guided procedure is evaluated by extensive
simulations of biopsies. Needle biopsies yield sufficient histological
information to establish a quantitative relationship between D-value and cell
density, provided they are taken from regions with high, intermediate, and low
D-value in DWI. The automated localization of the biopsy regions is
demonstrated from a NSCLC patient tumor. In this case, even two or three
biopsies give a reasonable estimate. Simulations of needle biopsies under
different conditions indicate that the DWI-guidance highly improves the
estimation results. Tumor cellularity and heterogeneity in solid tumors may be
reliably investigated from DWI and a few needle biopsies that are sampled in
regions of well-separated D-values, excluding adipose tissue. This procedure
could provide a way of embedding in the clinical workflow assistance in cancer
diagnosis and treatment based on personalized information.

by DCA algorithm. Then, we focus on the construction of DC cuts, which serves
either as a local cut (namely type-I DC cut) at feasible local minimizer of
MBLP, or as a global cut (namely type-II DC cut) at infeasible local minimizer
of MBLP if some particular assumptions are verified. Otherwise, the
constructibility of DC cut is still unclear, and we propose to use classical
global cuts (such as the Lift-and-Project cut) instead. Combining DC cut and
classical global cuts, a cutting plane algorithm, namely DCCUT, is established
for globally solving MBLP. The convergence theorem of DCCUT is proved.
Restarting DCA in DCCUT helps to quickly update the upper bound solution and to
introduce more DC cuts for lower bound improvement. A variant of DCCUT by
introducing more classical global cuts in each iteration is proposed, and
parallel versions of DCCUT and its variant are also designed which use the
power of multiple processors for better performance. Numerical simulations of

$H$ that has $str(H) = |V(H)| + \d(H)$ with $\d(H)=\d(G)$. Further, new good
lower bounds of $str(G)$ are also obtained. Using these, we determined the

particles rise (driven by percolation) and heavy particles sink (driven by
buoyancy). When the two particle species differ from each other in both size
and density, the two segregation mechanisms either enhance (large/light and
small/heavy) or oppose (large/heavy and small/light) each other. In the latter
case, an equilibrium condition exists in which the two segregation mechanisms
balance and the particles no longer segregate. This leads to a methodology to
design non-segregating particle mixtures by specifying particle size ratio,
density ratio, and mixture concentration to achieve the equilibrium condition.
Using DEM simulations of quasi-2D bounded heap flow, we show that segregation
is significantly reduced for particle mixtures near the equilibrium condition.
In addition, the rise-sink transition for a range of particle size and density
ratios matches the combined size and density segregation model predictions.

defined such a generalisation by distinguishing tokens according to their
causal history. However, this so-called individual token interpretation is

of defining a more abstract notion of process, thereby obtaining a so-called
collective token interpretation. Here we give a short overview on these
attempts and then identify a subclass of Petri nets, called structural conflict
nets, where the interplay between conflict and concurrency due to token
multiplicity does not occur. For this subclass, we define abstract processes as

strengths among the levels where normally one expects strong strengths; (ii)
$E2$ decay of the levels of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ bands to the ground band are

existing methods simply stack different point attributes/modalities (e.g.
coordinates, intensity, depth, etc.) as image channels to increase information
capacity, but ignore distinct characteristics of point attributes in different
image channels. We design FPS-Net, a convolutional fusion network that exploits
the uniqueness and discrepancy among the projected image channels for optimal
point cloud segmentation. FPS-Net adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Instead
of simply stacking multiple channel images as a single input, we group them
into different modalities to first learn modality-specific features separately
and then map the learned features into a common high-dimensional feature space
for pixel-level fusion and learning. Specifically, we design a residual dense
block with multiple receptive fields as a building block in the encoder which
preserves detailed information in each modality and learns hierarchical
modality-specific and fused features effectively. In the FPS-Net decoder, we
use a recurrent convolution block likewise to hierarchically decode fused
features into output space for pixel-level classification. Extensive
experiments conducted on two widely adopted point cloud datasets show that
FPS-Net achieves superior semantic segmentation as compared with
state-of-the-art projection-based methods. In addition, the proposed modality
fusion idea is compatible with typical projection-based methods and can be
incorporated into them with consistent performance improvements.

perusing such rule-based descriptions lead to boredom due to repetitive

fact checking. By augmenting the data using back-translation, we doubled the
sample size of the dataset and the DistilBERT model was able to obtain good
performance (accuracy: 0.972; areas under the curve: 0.993) in detecting
misinformation about COVID-19. Our model was also tested on a larger dataset
for AAAI2021 - COVID-19 Fake News Detection Shared Task and obtained good

both datasets was better than traditional machine learning models. Second, in

model explainability, which was further evaluated using a between-subjects

significantly more likely to trust and share information related to COVID-19 in

the constraints of harvested energy. While existing energy harvesting systems
either wake up periodically at a fixed rate to sense and process the data, or
wake up only in accordance with the availability of the energy source, SmartON
employs a three-phase learning framework to learn the energy harvesting pattern
as well as the pattern of events at run-time, and uses that knowledge to wake
itself up when events are most likely to occur. The three-phase learning
framework enables rapid adaptation to environmental changes in both short and
long terms. Being able to remain asleep more often than a CTID

hardware platform whose power management module activates capacitors on-the-fly

scores, that operates within the low resource regime. On feeding the compressed
documents to BART, we observe a 6.0 ROUGE-L improvement. Our method also beats
several competitive salience detection baselines. Furthermore, the identified

frustrated magnetic network and structural randomness enable cooling to
temperatures several times lower than the energy scale of magnetic
interactions, which is the main limiting factor for the base temperature of

replication (SMR) to reach agreement on an ever-growing, linearly ordered log
of transactions. A new paradigm, combined with decades of research in BFT SMR
and blockchain (namely chained-BFT, or cBFT), has emerged for directly
constructing blockchain protocols. Chained-BFT protocols have a unifying
propose-vote scheme instead of multiple different voting phases with a set of
voting and commit rules to guarantee safety and liveness. However, distinct
voting and commit rules impose varying impacts on performance under different
workloads, network conditions, and Byzantine attacks. Therefore, a fair
comparison of the proposed protocols poses a challenge that has not yet been
addressed by existing work.
  We fill this gap by studying a family of cBFT protocols with a two-pronged
systematic approach. First, we present an evaluation framework, Bamboo, for
quick prototyping of cBFT protocols and that includes helpful benchmarking
facilities. To validate Bamboo, we introduce an analytic model using queuing
theory which also offers a back-of-the-envelope guide for dissecting these
protocols. We build multiple cBFT protocols using Bamboo and we are the first
to fairly compare three representatives (i.e., HotStuff, two-chain HotStuff,
and Streamlet). We evaluated these protocols under various parameters and
scenarios, including two Byzantine attacks that have not been widely discussed
in the literature. Our findings reveal interesting trade-offs (e.g.,
responsiveness vs. forking-resilience) between different cBFT protocols and
their design choices, which provide developers and researchers with insights
into the design and implementation of this protocol family.

models, DL models remain susceptible to adversarial attacks. We hypothesize
that the adversarial vulnerability of DL models stems from two factors. The
first factor is data sparsity which is that in the high dimensional input data
space, there exist large regions outside the support of the data distribution.
The second factor is the existence of many redundant parameters in the DL
models. Owing to these factors, different models are able to come up with
different decision boundaries with comparably high prediction accuracy. The
appearance of the decision boundaries in the space outside the support of the
data distribution does not affect the prediction accuracy of the model.
However, it makes an important difference in the adversarial robustness of the
model. We hypothesize that the ideal decision boundary is as far as possible
from the support of the data distribution. In this paper, we develop a training
framework to observe if DL models are able to learn such a decision boundary
spanning the space around the class distributions further from the data points
themselves. Semi-supervised learning was deployed during training by leveraging
unlabeled data generated in the space outside the support of the data
distribution. We measured adversarial robustness of the models trained using
this training framework against well-known adversarial attacks and by using
robustness metrics. We found that models trained using our framework, as well
as other regularization methods and adversarial training support our hypothesis
of data sparsity and that models trained with these methods learn to have
decision boundaries more similar to the aforementioned ideal decision boundary.

points is reduced because ICP basically minimizes the distance between points.
To avoid this problem, symmetric KL-divergence is introduced to the ICP cost
that reflects the difference between two probabilistic distributions. The cost
includes not only the distance between points but also differences between
distribution shapes. The experimental results on the KITTI dataset indicate
that the proposed method has high computational efficiency, strongly
outperforms other methods, and has similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art
SLAM method.

challenge due to the super-rich text shape variation in text line orientations,
lengths, curvatures, etc. This paper presents a mask-guided multi-task network
that detects and rectifies scene texts of arbitrary shapes reliably. Three
types of keypoints are detected which specify the centre line and so the shape
of text instances accurately. In addition, four types of keypoint links are
detected of which the horizontal links associate the detected keypoints of each
text instance and the vertical links predict a pair of landmark points (for
each keypoint) along the upper and lower text boundary, respectively. Scene
texts can be located and rectified by linking up the associated landmark points
(giving localization polygon boxes) and transforming the polygon boxes via thin
plate spline, respectively. Extensive experiments over several public datasets
show that the use of text keypoints is tolerant to the variation in text
orientations, lengths, and curvatures, and it achieves superior scene text
detection and rectification performance as compared with state-of-the-art

vision to infer about the 3D world. Recent advances in deep learning have shown
their efficiency in 3D object recognition, among which view-based methods have

large amount of data labels with high costs. In contrast, self-supervised
learning aims to learn multi-view feature representations without involving
labeled data. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised paradigm to learn
Multi-View Transformation Equivariant Representations (MV-TER), exploring the
equivariant transformations of a 3D object and its projected multiple views.
Specifically, we perform a 3D transformation on a 3D object, and obtain
multiple views before and after the transformation via projection. Then, we
self-train a representation to capture the intrinsic 3D object representation
by decoding 3D transformation parameters from the fused feature representations
of multiple views before and after the transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed MV-TER significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art view-based approaches in 3D object classification and

the field of statistical finance, M. F. M. Osborne published in 1956 [6] an
essential paper and proposed to treat the question of stock market motion
through the prism of both the Law of Weber-Fechner [1, 4] and the branch of
physics developed by James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Willard
Gibbs [3, 5] namely the statistical mechanics. He proposed an improvement of
the known research made by his predecessor Louis Jean-Baptiste Alphonse
Bachelier, by not considering the arithmetic changes of stock prices as means
of statistical measurement, but by drawing on the Weber-Fechner Law, to treat
the changes of prices. Osborne emphasized that as in statistical mechanics, the
probability distribution of the steady-state of subjective change in prices is
determined by the condition of maximum probability, a statement close to the
Gibbs distribution conditions. However, Osborne also admitted that the
empirical observation of the probability distribution of logarithmic changes of
stock prices was emphasizing obvious asymmetries and consequently could not
perfectly confirm his prior theory. The purpose of this paper is to propose an
explanation to what we could call the Osborne paradox and then address an
alternative approach via Bayesian inference regarding the description of the
probability distribution of changes in logarithms of prices that was
thenceforth under the prism of frequentist inference. We show that the stock
market returns are locally described by equilibrium statistical mechanics with
conserved statistics variables, whereas globally there is yet other statistics
with persistent flowing variables that can be effectively described by a
superposition of several statistics on different time scales, namely, a
superstatistics.

learning model for representation learning on graphs. However, it remains
notoriously challenging to train and inference GCNs over large graph datasets,
limiting their application to large real-world graphs and hindering the
exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN graphs. This is because as the
graph size grows, the sheer number of node features and the large adjacency
matrix can easily explode the required memory and data movements. To tackle the
aforementioned challenges, we explore the possibility of drawing lottery
tickets when sparsifying GCN graphs, i.e., subgraphs that largely shrink the
adjacency matrix yet are capable of achieving accuracy comparable to or even
better than their full graphs. Specifically, we for the first time discover the
existence of graph early-bird (GEB) tickets that emerge at the very early stage
when sparsifying GCN graphs, and propose a simple yet effective detector to
automatically identify the emergence of such GEB tickets. Furthermore, we
advocate graph-model co-optimization and develop a generic efficient GCN
early-bird training framework dubbed GEBT that can significantly boost the
efficiency of GCN training by (1) drawing joint early-bird tickets between the
GCN graphs and models and (2) enabling simultaneously sparsification of both
the GCN graphs and models. Experiments on various GCN models and datasets
consistently validate our GEB finding and the effectiveness of our GEBT, e.g.,
our GEBT achieves up to 80.2% ~ 85.6% and 84.6% ~ 87.5% savings of GCN training

  In this paper, we apply coverage-guided fuzzing to enterprise-level DBMSs
from Huawei and Bloomberg LP. In our practice of testing GaussDB and Comdb2, we
found major challenges in all three testing stages. The challenges are
collecting precise coverage, optimizing fuzzing performance, and analyzing root
causes. In search of a general method to overcome these challenges, we propose
Ratel, a coverage-guided fuzzer for enterprise-level DBMSs. With its
industry-oriented design, Ratel improves the feedback precision, enhances the
robustness of input generation, and performs an on-line investigation on the
root cause of bugs. As a result, Ratel outperformed other fuzzers in terms of
coverage and bugs. Compared to industrial black box fuzzers SQLsmith and
SQLancer, as well as coverage-guided academic fuzzer Squirrel, Ratel covered
38.38%, 106.14%, 583.05% more basic blocks than the best results of other three
fuzzers in GaussDB, PostgreSQL, and Comdb2, respectively. More importantly,
Ratel has discovered 32, 42, and 5 unknown bugs in GaussDB, Comdb2, and
PostgreSQL.

  revisit to Andreev$-$Saint-James reflection and Josephson effect",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Although the standard theory of superconductivity based on the BCS theory is
a successful one, several experimental results indicate the necessity for a
fundamental revision. We argue that the revision is on the origin of the phase
variable for superconductivity; this phase appears as a consequence of the
electron-pairing in the standard theory, but its origin is a Berry connection
arising from many-body wave functions.
  When this Berry connection is non-trivial, it gives rise to a collective mode
that generates supercurrent; this collective mode creates number-changing
operators for particles participating in this mode, and these number-changing
operators stabilize the superconducting state by exploiting the Cooper
instability. In the new theory, the role of the electron-pairing is to
stabilize the nontrivial Berry connection; it is not the cause of
superconductivity.
  In BCS superconductors, however, the simultaneous appearance of the
nontrivial Berry connection and the electron-pairing occurs. Therefore, the
electron-pairing amplitude can be used as an order parameter for the
superconducting state. We revisit the Andreev$-$Saint-James reflection and the
Josephson effect. They are explained as consequence of the presence of the
Berry connection. Bogoliubov quasiparticles are replaced by the particle-number
conserving Bogoliubov excitations that describe the transfer of electrons
between the collective mod and single particle mode.

large, any local minimum point and local maximum point of the $L_2$ loss
between the true process and the computer model is a local minimum point of the
PK loss function; (2) all the local minima of the PK loss function converge to

the projected kernel calibration to identify the global minimum of the $L_2$

problem, a frequentist method which we term penalized projected kernel
calibration method is suggested and analyzed in detail. We prove that the

categories of the widely-occurred prohibited item ``cutters''. The images are
gathered from an airport and these prohibited items are annotated manually by

  correlators in CFT$_2$","34 pages and 8 figures. Corrected the 6pt comb-channel answer",,,,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently introduced reparametrization mode operators in CFTs have been shown
to govern stress tensor interactions $via$ the shadow operator formalism and
seem to govern the effective dynamics of chaotic systems. We initiate a study
of Ward identities of reparametrization mode operators $i.e.$ how two
dimensional CFT Ward identities govern the behaviour of insertions of
reparametrization modes $\epsilon$ in correlation functions:
$\langle\epsilon\epsilon\phi\phi\rangle$. We find that in the semi-classical
limit of large $c$ they dictate the leading $\mathcal{O}(c^{-1})$ behaviour.
While for the $4$pt function this reproduces the same computation as done by
Heahl, Reeves \& Rozali in \cite{Haehl:2019eae}, in the case of 6pt function of
pair-wise equal operators this provides an alternative way of computing the
Virasoro block in stress-tensor comb channel. We compute a maximally out of
time ordered correlation function in a thermal background and find the expected
behaviour of an exponential growth governed by Lyapunov index
$\lambda_L=2\pi/\beta$ lasting for twice the scrambling time of the system
$t^*=\frac{\beta}{2\pi}\log\,c$ for the maximally braided type of
$out$-$of$-$time$-$ordering$. However when only the internal operators of the
comb channel are \emph{out-of-time-ordered}, the correlator sees no exponential
behaviour despite the inclusion of the Virasoro contribution. From a bulk
perspective for the \emph{out-of-time-ordered} $4$pt function we find that the
Casimir equation for the stress tensor block reproduces the linearised back
reaction in the bulk.

rich symphony of signals with sources ranging from galactic white dwarf
binaries to extreme mass ratio inspirals. Many of these gravitational-wave
signals will not be individually resolvable. Instead, they will incoherently
add to produce stochastic gravitational-wave confusion noise whose frequency
content will be governed by the dynamics of the sources. The angular structure
of the power of the confusion noise will be modulated by the distribution of
the sources across the sky. Measurement of this structure can yield important
information about the distribution of sources on galactic and extra-galactic
scales, their astrophysics and their evolution over cosmic timescales.
Moreover, since the confusion noise is part of the noise budget of LISA,
mapping it will also be essential for studying resolvable signals. In this
paper, we present a Bayesian algorithm to probe the angular distribution of the
stochastic gravitational-wave confusion noise with LISA using a spherical
harmonic basis. We develop a technique based on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to
mathematically constrain the spherical harmonics to yield a non-negative

significantly change the structure of thin disk by taking away the angular

Conversely, if we keep the period unchanged, the outburst intensity can be
raised for several times. These results can help to explain the observational

the BPSK signal. Moreover, the Walsh code set is grouped into several
orthogonal subsets to eliminate the interference from other users. A maximum

based on deep learning, which can improve the image contrast and reduce noise

contains two deep sub-networks, an Image Contrast Enhancement Network (ICE-Net)
and a Re-Enhancement and Denoising Network (RED-Net). The ICE-Net takes the low
light image as input and produces a contrast enhanced image. The RED-Net takes
the result of ICE-Net and the low light image as input, and can re-enhance the
low light image and denoise at the same time. Both of the networks can be
trained with low light images only, which is achieved by a Maximum Entropy
based Retinex (ME-Retinex) model and an assumption that noises are
independently distributed. In the ME-Retinex model, a new constraint on the
reflectance image is introduced that the maximum channel of the reflectance
image conforms to the maximum channel of the low light image and its entropy
should be the largest, which converts the decomposition of reflectance and
illumination in Retinex model to a non-ill-conditioned problem and allows the
ICE-Net to be trained with a self-supervised way. The loss functions of RED-Net
are carefully formulated to separate the noises and details during training,
and they are based on the idea that, if noises are independently distributed,
after the processing of smoothing filters (\eg mean filter), the gradient of
the noise part should be smaller than the gradient of the detail part. It can
be proved qualitatively and quantitatively through experiments that the
proposed method is efficient.

pair can induce spatial dispersion to smooth and enlarge the laser beam, which
increase the maximum input and output pulse energies. As a result, as high as
100 PW laser with single beam or more than 150 PW through combining two beams
can be obtained by using MPC and current available optics. This new optical
design will simplify the compressor, improve the stability, and save expensive
gratings/optics simultaneously. Together with the multi-beam tiled-aperture
combining method, the tiled-grating method, larger gratings, or negative chirp
pulse based self-compression method, several 100s PW laser beam is expected to
be obtained by using this MPC method in the future, which will further extend
the ultra-intense laser physics research fields.

or optimization of contrastive loss objectives. In self-supervised learning,
data augmentation techniques are widely applied and data labels are not
required since pseudo labels can be estimated from trained models on similar

adjusting the dendrite field size of the spatial filter. Meanwhile, an

linear operators defined on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. More
precisely, we consider two bounded, coercive, and self-adjoint operators

investigate the conditions under which the whole spectrum of
$\bc{B}^{-1}\bc{A}:V\mapsto V$ can be approximated to an arbitrary accuracy by
the eigenvalues of the finite dimensional discretization
$\bc{B}_n^{-1}\bc{A}_n$. Since $\bc{B}^{-1}\bc{A}$ is continuously invertible,
such an investigation cannot use the concept of uniform (normwise) convergence,
and it relies instead on the pointwise (strong) convergence of
$\bc{B}_n^{-1}\bc{A}_n$ to $\bc{B}^{-1}\bc{A}$.
  The paper is motivated by operator preconditioning which is employed in the

appealing in its relaxed assumption on reference images, i.e., it does not

through a set of carefully formulated non-reference loss functions, which

thermodynamic properties of the frustrated layered quantum magnet
SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ -- the Shastry-Sutherland material -- have provided strong
evidence for a low-temperature phase transition between plaquette-singlet and
antiferromagnetic order as a function of pressure. Further motivated by the
recently discovered unusual first-order quantum phase transition with an
apparent emergent O(4) symmetry of the antiferromagnetic and plaquette-singlet
order parameters in a two-dimensional ""checkerboard J-Q"" quantum spin model [B.
Zhao et al., Nat. Phys. 15, 678 (2019)], we here study the same model in the
presence of weak inter-layer couplings. Our focus is on the evolution of the
emergent symmetry as the system crosses over from two to three dimensions and
the phase transition extends from strictly zero temperature in two dimensions
up to finite temperature as expected in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. Using quantum
Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase boundaries of the
plaquette-singlet and antiferromagnetic phases, with particular focus on the
triple point where these two order phases meet the paramagnetic phase for given
strength of the inter-layer coupling. All transitions are first-order in the
neighborhood of the triple points. We show that the emergent O(4) symmetry of
the coexistence state breaks down clearly when the interlayer coupling becomes
sufficiently large, but for a weak coupling, of the magnitude expected
experimentally, the enlarged symmetry can still be observed at the triple point
up to significant length scales. Thus, it is likely that the plaquette-singlet
to antiferromagnetic transition in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ exhibits remnants of
emergent O(4) symmetry, which should be observable due to additional weakly
gapped Goldstone modes.

  Setting",,,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The motivating question for this work is a long standing open problem, posed
by Nisan (1991), regarding the relative powers of algebraic branching programs
(ABPs) and formulas in the non-commutative setting. Even though the general
question continues to remain open, we make some progress towards its
resolution. To that effect, we generalise the notion of ordered polynomials in
the non-commutative setting (defined by \Hrubes, Wigderson and Yehudayoff
(2011)) to define abecedarian polynomials and models that naturally compute
them.
  Our main contribution is a possible new approach towards separating formulas
and ABPs in the non-commutative setting, via lower bounds against abecedarian
formulas. In particular, we show the following.
  There is an explicit n-variate degree d abecedarian polynomial $f_{n,d}(x)$
such that 1. $f_{n, d}(x)$ can be computed by an abecedarian ABP of size O(nd);
2. any abecedarian formula computing $f_{n, \log n}(x)$ must have size that is
super-polynomial in n.
  We also show that a super-polynomial lower bound against abecedarian formulas
for $f_{\log n, n}(x)$ would separate the powers of formulas and ABPs in the
non-commutative setting.

conventional PTRM, but also the doubly-spread channel, since the path-specific

  under Sensor Attacks",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By using various sensors to measure the surroundings and sharing local sensor
information with the surrounding vehicles through wireless networks, connected
and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to increase safety, efficiency, and
capacity of our transportation systems. However, the increasing usage of
sensors has also increased the vulnerability of CAVs to sensor faults and
adversarial attacks. Anomalous sensor values resulting from malicious
cyberattacks or faulty sensors may cause severe consequences or even
fatalities. In this paper, we increase the resilience of CAVs to faults and
attacks by using multiple sensors for measuring the same physical variable to
create redundancy. We exploit this redundancy and propose a sensor fusion
algorithm for providing a robust estimate of the correct sensor information
with bounded errors independent of the attack signals, and for attack detection
and isolation. The proposed sensor fusion framework is applicable to a large
class of security-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). To minimize the
performance degradation resulting from the usage of estimation for control, we
provide an $H_{\infty}$ controller for CACC-equipped CAVs capable of
stabilizing the closed-loop dynamics of each vehicle in the platoon while
reducing the joint effect of estimation errors and communication channel noise
on the tracking performance and string behavior of the vehicle platoon.
Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our
methods.

observation that the generated samples for unseen-classes are often out of the
true distribution, which causes severe recognition rate imbalance between the
seen-class (high) and unseen-class (low). We show that the key reason is that
the generation is not Counterfactual Faithful, and thus we propose a faithful
one, whose generation is from the sample-specific counterfactual question: What
would the sample look like, if we set its class attribute to a certain class,
while keeping its sample attribute unchanged? Thanks to the faithfulness, we
can apply the Consistency Rule to perform unseen/seen binary classification, by
asking: Would its counterfactual still look like itself? If ``yes'', the sample
is from a certain class, and ``no'' otherwise. Through extensive experiments on
ZSL and OSR, we demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates the
seen/unseen imbalance and hence significantly improves the overall performance.
Note that this framework is orthogonal to existing methods, thus, it can serve
as a new baseline to evaluate how ZSL/OSR models generalize. Codes are

extensively the dynamics of skyrmion motion driven by magnon in an
antiferromagnet using the collective coordinate theory, focusing on the effect
of magnon polarization. It is revealed that the skyrmion Hall motion driven by
circularly polarized magnon becomes inevitable generally, consistent with

results unveil the strong inter-dependence between the linearly polarized

skyrmion motion on the polarization nature of driving magnon. On the reversal,
the scattering from the moving skyrmion may lead to decomposition of the
linearly polarized magnon into two elliptically polarized magnon bands.
Consequently, a net transverse force acting on skyrmion is generated owing to
the broken mirror symmetry, which in turn drives a skyrmion Hall motion. The
Hall motion can be completely suppressed only in some specific condition where
the mirror symmetry is preserved. The present work unveils non-trivial
skyrmion-magnon scattering behavior in antiferromagnets, advancing the

transport modelling. Accurate modelling of the pressure strain correlation

models are often unreliable for complex turbulent flows. Machine learning based
models have shown promise in turbulence modeling but their application has been
largely restricted to eddy viscosity based models. In this article, we outline
a rationale for the preferential application of machine learning and turbulence
data to develop models at the level of Reynolds stress modeling. As the
illustration We develop data driven models for the pressure strain correlation
for turbulent channel flow using neural networks. The input features of the
neural networks are chosen using physics based rationale. The networks are
trained with the high resolution DNS data of turbulent channel flow at
different friction Reynolds numbers. The testing of the models are performed
for unknown flow statistics at other friction Reynolds numbers and also for
turbulent plane Couette flows. Based on the results presented in this article,
the proposed machine learning framework exhibits considerable promise and may
be utilized for the development of accurate Reynolds stress models for flow

proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {124}, 110401~(2020)]. In this work, we firstly
define the complete monogamy for this multipartite quantum discord (MQD) and
the global quantum discord (GQD). MQD, with the same spirit as the complete
monogamy of entanglement, is said to be completely monogamous (i) if it does
not increase under coarsening of subsystems and (ii) if some given combination
of subsystems reach the total amount of the correlation, then all other
combination of subsystems that do not include all the given subsystems do not
contain such a correlation any more. Here, coarsening of subsystems means
discarding or combining some subsystems up to the given partition.
Simultaneously, the complete monogamy of GQD is also defined with slight
modification on the coarsening relation.Consequently, we explore all the
coarsening relations of MQD and show that it is completely monogamous with a
modicum assumption. In addition, with the same spirit, we investigate all the
coarsening relations for GQD and show that GQD is not completely
monogamous.That is, in the sense of the complete monogamy relation, MQD as a
generalization of the original QD captures the nature of such a quantum
correlation, and thus it is nicer than GQD as a generalization.

$L^\infty(0,T;H^k)\cap L^2(0,T;H^{k+1})$ for any $k\ge1$. The proof proceeds in
two steps. First, based on an energy estimate in the aforementioned space
together with a compactness argument we prove existence of a unique solution,

in the second step where the continuity in the optimal norm is established
through an application of the rough Gronwall lemma. Our approach is direct and

$\lambda$, which vanish in the general relativistic limit. Solar system and
gravitational wave experiments bound two of these couplings ($\alpha$ and

General Relativity, even in vacuum, previous calculations of the dynamics of

compute black-hole quasinormal modes, and find again that they behave {\it

are concerned. Nevertheless, we find that spherical collapse leads to the
formation of a regular {\it universal} horizon, i.e. a causal boundary for
signals of arbitrary propagation speeds, inside the usual event horizon for
matter and tensor gravitons. Our analysis also confirms that the additional
scalar degree of freedom present alongside the spin-2 graviton of General
Relativity remains strongly coupled at low energies, even on curved

correspondence matching based methods require the inputs to have distinctive
geometric structures to fit a 3D rigid transformation according to point-wise
sparse feature matches. However, the accuracy of transformation heavily relies
on the quality of extracted features, which are prone to errors with respect to
partiality and noise. In addition, they can not utilize the geometric knowledge
of all the overlapping regions. On the other hand, previous global feature
based approaches can utilize the entire point cloud for the registration,
however they ignore the negative effect of non-overlapping points when
aggregating global features. In this paper, we present OMNet, a global feature
based iterative network for partial-to-partial point cloud registration. We
learn overlapping masks to reject non-overlapping regions, which converts the
partial-to-partial registration to the registration of the same shape.
Moreover, the previously used data is sampled only once from the CAD models for
each object, resulting in the same point clouds for the source and reference.
We propose a more practical manner of data generation where a CAD model is

  Both formulations are numerically solved by implementing a mixed finite

M.~Steinby (1999) identified three natural types of directing words, called
D1-, D2- and D3-directing words, for nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs).
Here we adapt these notions for fuzzy finite automata (FFAs). The D3-directing
words obtained this way are precisely the directing words introduced by
V.~Karthikeyan and M. Rajasekar (2015). With any FFA F we associate an NFA Fnd
which has the same Di-directing words as F. Thus, if these definitions are
used, the theory of directable FFAs reduces to that of NFAs.
  We also introduce three new kinds of directing words of fuzzy automata that
we call DD1-, DD2- and DD3-directing words, respectively which depend more on
the fuzzy transition degrees between states. We establish some basic properties
of the sets $DDi(F)$ of DDi-directing words of any given FFA F. In particular,
it is shown that these languages are regular, and that DDi-directability is

argue that this trend of ""energy for accuracy"" is not necessary -- a little
energy can go a long way to achieve the near-zero accuracy loss. Specifically,
we propose a novel CNN-to-SNN conversion method that is able to use a
reasonably short spike train (e.g., 256 timesteps for CIFAR10 images) to
achieve the near-zero accuracy loss. The new conversion method, named as
explicit current control (ECC), contains three techniques (current
normalisation, thresholding for residual elimination, and consistency
maintenance for batch-normalisation), in order to explicitly control the
currents flowing through the SNN when processing inputs. We implement ECC into
a tool nicknamed SpKeras, which can conveniently import Keras CNN models and
convert them into SNNs. We conduct an extensive set of experiments with the
tool -- working with VGG16 and various datasets such as CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 --
and compare with state-of-the-art conversion methods. Results show that ECC is
a promising method that can optimise over energy consumption and accuracy loss
simultaneously.

comparing large 3D models from SkySat data is to correct inconsistencies
between the camera models associated to the multiple views that are necessary
to cover the area at a given time, where these camera models are represented as
Rational Polynomial Cameras (RPCs). We address the problem by proposing a
date-wise RPC refinement, able to handle dynamic areas covered by sets of
partially overlapping views. The cameras are refined by means of a rotation
that compensates for errors due to inaccurate knowledge of the satellite
attitude. The refined RPCs are then used to reconstruct multiple consistent
Digital Surface Models (DSMs) from different stereo pairs at each date. RPC
refinement strengthens the consistency between the DSMs of each date, which is
extremely beneficial to accurately measure volumes in the 3D surface models.
The system is tested in a real case scenario, to monitor large coal stockpiles.
Our volume estimates are validated with measurements collected on site in the
same period of time.

centroidal dynamics with the manipulated-object dynamics. This allows us to
describe any high-level task in the same cost/constraint function. The
resulting planning framework could be solved on the robot's onboard computer in
real-time within a model predictive control scheme. This is demonstrated in a

hydrodynamics, the hydrodynamics on a non-commutative space (obtained by the
quantization of space), proposed by Nambu in his last work, is formulated as
``hydrodynamics of granular material''. In Part 1, the quantization of space is
done by Moyal product, and the hydrodynamic simulation is performed for the so
obtained two dimensional fluid, which flows inside a canal with an obstacle.
The obtained results differ between two cases in which the size of a fluid
particle is zero and finite. The difference seems to come from the behavior of
vortices generated by an obstacle. In Part 2 of quantization, considering
vortex as a string, two models are examined; one is the ``hybrid model'' in
which vortices interact with each other by exchanging Kalb-Ramond fields (a
generalization of stream functions), and the other is the more general ``string
field theory'' in which Kalb-Ramond field is one of the excitation mode of
string oscillations. In the string field theory, Altarelli-Parisi type
evolution equation is introduced. It is expected to describe the response of
distribution function of vortex inside a turbulence, when the energy scale is
changed. The behaviour of viscosity differs in the string theory, being
compared with the particle theory, so that Landau theory of fluid to introduce
viscosity may be modified. In conclusion, the hydrodynamics and the string
theory are almost identical theories. It should be noted, however, that the
string theory to reproduce a given hydrodynamics is not a usual string theory.

machine learning.The key challenge of OSR is how to reduce the empirical
classification risk on the labeled known data and the open space risk on the
potential unknown data simultaneously. To handle the challenge, we formulate
the open space risk problem from the perspective of multi-class integration,
and model the unexploited extra-class space with a novel concept Reciprocal
Point. Follow this, a novel learning framework, termed Adversarial Reciprocal
Point Learning (ARPL), is proposed to minimize the overlap of known
distribution and unknown distributions without loss of known classification
accuracy. Specifically, each reciprocal point is learned by the extra-class
space with the corresponding known category, and the confrontation among
multiple known categories are employed to reduce the empirical classification
risk. Then, an adversarial margin constraint is proposed to reduce the open
space risk by limiting the latent open space constructed by reciprocal points.
To further estimate the unknown distribution from open space, an instantiated
adversarial enhancement method is designed to generate diverse and confusing
training samples, based on the adversarial mechanism between the reciprocal
points and known classes. This can effectively enhance the model
distinguishability to the unknown classes. Extensive experimental results on
various benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method is significantly
superior to other existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

biomedical applications. In this study, we develop a polycrystalline phase
field to investigate the grain size dependence of the martensitic
transformation and associated mechanical properties of nanograined Ti-Nb
alloys. It is shown that a reduction of the average grain size strengthens the
suppression of the martensitic transformation (MT), leading to an increase of
the transformation stress, shrinkage of the stress hysteresis, and elimination
of residual strain. The time-temperature-transformation curves of nano-grained
Ti-Nb alloys with different average grain sizes are obtained and the validity
of Hall-Petch relation is also confirmed in all studied grain sizes.
Furthermore, when the average grain size becomes ultrasmall, both the
temperature- and stress-induced MTs show the continuous second-order phase
transition behavior. These superior transformation characteristics are
attributed to the high density of grain boundaries and the related dominant
role of the gradient energy at the nanoscale. Our results have profound
implications for the design and control of the properties in nano-grained shape

localities, in particular to linking localities. Here localities are group-like
structures associated to fusion systems which were introduced by Chermak.
Linking localities (by Chermak also called proper localities) are special kinds
of localities which correspond to linking systems. Thus they contain the
algebraic information that is needed to study $p$-completed classifying spaces
of fusion systems as generalizations of $p$-completed classifying spaces of
finite groups.
  Because of the group-like nature of localities, there is a natural notion of
partial normal subgroups. Given a locality $\mathcal{L}$ and a partial normal
subgroup $\mathcal{N}$ of $\mathcal{L}$, we show that there is a largest
partial normal subgroup $\mathcal{N}^\perp$ of $\mathcal{L}$ which, in a
certain sense, commutes elementwise with $\mathcal{N}$ and thus morally plays
the role of a ""centralizer"" of $\mathcal{N}$ in $\mathcal{L}$. This leads to a
nice notion of the generalized Fitting subgroup $F^*(\mathcal{L})$ of a linking
locality $\mathcal{L}$. Building on these results we define and study special
kinds of linking localities called regular localities. It turns out that there
is a theory of components of regular localities akin to the theory of
components of finite groups. The main concepts we introduce and work with in
the present paper (in particular $\mathcal{N}^\perp$ in the special case of
linking localities, $F^*(\mathcal{L})$, regular localities and components of
regular localities) were already introduced and studied in a preprint by
Chermak. However, we give a different and self-contained approach to the

real-world applications, such as Web search engines, question answering
systems, conversational bots, and so on. While relevance acts as a unified
concept in all these retrieval tasks, the inherent definitions are quite
different due to the heterogeneity of these tasks. This raises a question to
us: Do these different forms of relevance really lead to different modeling
focuses? To answer this question, in this work, we conduct an empirical study
on relevance modeling in three representative IR tasks, i.e., document
retrieval, answer retrieval, and response retrieval. Specifically, we attempt
to study the following two questions: 1) Does relevance modeling in these tasks
really show differences in terms of natural language understanding (NLU)? We
employ 16 linguistic tasks to probe a unified retrieval model over these three
retrieval tasks to answer this question. 2) If there do exist differences, how
can we leverage the findings to enhance the relevance modeling? We proposed
three intervention methods to investigate how to leverage different modeling
focuses of relevance to improve these IR tasks. We believe the way we study the
problem as well as our findings would be beneficial to the IR community.

impact that improper use of ML can have on users and society is now also widely
recognised. To address this issue, policy makers and other stakeholders, such
as the European Commission or NIST, have proposed high-level guidelines aiming
to promote trustworthy ML (i.e., lawful, ethical and robust). However, these
guidelines do not specify actions to be taken by those involved in building ML
systems. In this paper, we argue that guidelines related to the development of
trustworthy ML can be translated to operational practices, and should become
part of the ML development life cycle. Towards this goal, we ran a multi-vocal
literature review, and mined operational practices from white and grey
literature. Moreover, we launched a global survey to measure practice adoption
and the effects of these practices. In total, we identified 14 new practices,
and used them to complement an existing catalogue of ML engineering practices.
Initial analysis of the survey results reveals that so far, practice adoption
for trustworthy ML is relatively low. In particular, practices related to
assuring security of ML components have very low adoption. Other practices
enjoy slightly larger adoption, such as providing explanations to users. Our
extended practice catalogue can be used by ML development teams to bridge the
gap between high-level guidelines and actual development of trustworthy ML
systems; it is open for review and contribution

$k$th nearest neighbors of being occupied, have been widely investigated in

transition in the 2NN model on the square lattice is still a topic of debate.
Here, we present grand-canonical solutions of this model on Husimi lattices
built with diagonal square lattices, with $2L(L+1)$ sites, for $L \leqslant 7$.
The systematic sequence of mean-field solutions confirms the existence of a
continuous transition in this system and extrapolations of the critical
chemical potential $\mu_{2,c}(L)$ and particle density $\rho_{2,c}(L)$ to $L
\rightarrow \infty$ yield estimates of these quantities in close agreement with
previous results for the 2NN model on the square lattice. To confirm the
reliability of this approach we employ it also for the 1NN model, where very
accurate estimates for the critical parameters $\mu_{1,c}$ and $\rho_{1,c}$ --
for the fluid-solid transition in this model on the square lattice -- are found
from extrapolations of data for $L \leqslant 6$. The non-classical critical
exponents for these transitions are investigated through the coherent anomaly
method (CAM), which in the 1NN case yields $\beta$ and $\nu$ differing by at
most 6\% from the expected Ising exponents. For the 2NN model, the CAM analysis
is somewhat inconclusive, because the exponents sensibly depend on the value of
$\mu_{2,c}$ used to calculate them. Notwithstanding, our results suggest that
$\beta$ and $\nu$ are considerably larger than the Ashkin-Teller exponents
reported in numerical studies of the 2NN system.

these results in terms of derived cohomology classes coming from the setting of
diagonal cycles, showing that the same $\mathcal L$-invariant which arises in
the theory of $p$-adic $L$-functions also governs the arithmetic of Euler
systems. Thus, we can reduce, in the split multiplicative situation, the
conjecture of Darmon, Lauder and Rotger to a more familiar statement about
higher order derivatives of a triple product $p$-adic $L$-function at a point
lying inside the region of classical interpolation, in the realm of the more

labeled training samples. Moreover, all possible classes may not be initially

training every new set of classes instead of training the full model. This
helps in preventing overfitting. We choose the few parameters from the model in
such a way that only the currently unimportant parameters get selected. By
keeping the important parameters in the model intact, our approach minimizes
catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we minimize the cosine similarity between
the new and the old class prototypes in order to maximize their separation,

platforms, aims to adapt a source TTS model to synthesize personal voice for a
target speaker using few speech data. Custom voice presents two unique
challenges for TTS adaptation: 1) to support diverse customers, the adaptation
model needs to handle diverse acoustic conditions that could be very different
from source speech data, and 2) to support a large number of customers, the
adaptation parameters need to be small enough for each target speaker to reduce
memory usage while maintaining high voice quality. In this work, we propose
AdaSpeech, an adaptive TTS system for high-quality and efficient customization
of new voices. We design several techniques in AdaSpeech to address the two
challenges in custom voice: 1) To handle different acoustic conditions, we use
two acoustic encoders to extract an utterance-level vector and a sequence of
phoneme-level vectors from the target speech during training; in inference, we
extract the utterance-level vector from a reference speech and use an acoustic
predictor to predict the phoneme-level vectors. 2) To better trade off the
adaptation parameters and voice quality, we introduce conditional layer
normalization in the mel-spectrogram decoder of AdaSpeech, and fine-tune this
part in addition to speaker embedding for adaptation. We pre-train the source
TTS model on LibriTTS datasets and fine-tune it on VCTK and LJSpeech datasets
(with different acoustic conditions from LibriTTS) with few adaptation data,
e.g., 20 sentences, about 1 minute speech. Experiment results show that
AdaSpeech achieves much better adaptation quality than baseline methods, with
only about 5K specific parameters for each speaker, which demonstrates its
effectiveness for custom voice. Audio samples are available at

gamma-ray binaries in a pulsar-wind driven scenario. Aims. We apply this model
to one of the best-observed gamma-ray binaries, the LS 5039 system. Methods.
The model involves a joint simulation of the pulsar- and stellar-wind
interaction and the transport of electronic pairs from the pulsar wind
accelerated at the emerging shock structure. We compute the synchrotron and
inverse Compton emission in a post-processing step, while consistently
accounting for relativistic beaming and $\gamma \gamma$-absorption in the
stellar radiation field. Results. The stellar- and pulsar-wind interaction
leads to the formation of an extended, asymmetric wind collision region
developing strong shocks, turbulent mixing, and secondary shocks in the
turbulent flow. Both the structure of the collision region and the resulting
particle distributions show significant orbital variation. Next to the
acceleration of particles at the bow-like pulsar wind and Coriolis shock the
model naturally accounts for the reacceleration of particles at secondary
shocks contributing to the emission at very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays. The
model successfully reproduces the main spectral features of LS 5039. While the
predicted lightcurves in the high-energy and VHE gamma-ray band are in good
agreement with observations, our model still does not reproduce the X-ray to
low-energy gamma-ray modulation, which we attribute to the employed magnetic
field model. Conclusions. We successfully model the main spectral features of
the observed multiband, non-thermal emission of LS 5039 and thus further
substantiates a wind-driven interpretation of gamma-ray binaries. Open issues
relate to the synchrotron modulation, which might be addressed through a
magnetohydrodynamic extension of our model.

and sensitivity of LoTSS, we could probe the complex morphology of these GRGs,
unveiling cases with diffuse (Mpc-scale) remnant emission, presence of faint
off-axis wings, or a misaligned inner jet. In particular, for one source
(B21144+35B), we could clearly detect a $\sim$300 kpc wide off-axis emission,
in addition to an inner jet which orientation is not aligned with the lobes
axis. For another source (J1153.9+5848) a structure consistent with jet
precession was revealed, appearing as an X-shaped morphology with relic lobes
having an extension larger than the present ones, and with a different axis
orientation. From an environment analysis, we found 2 sources showing an
overdensity of cosmological neighbours, and a correspondent association with a
galaxy cluster from catalogues. Finally, a comparison with radio-selected GRGs

illustrate the interactions between the pilot and main flames, three operating
modes are studied, where the burner works with: (i) only the pilot flame, (ii)
only the main flame, and (iii) the stratified flame (with both the pilot and
main flames). We found that: (1) In the pilot flame mode, the flame changes
from V-shape to M-shape when the main stage is switched from closed to
supplying a pure air stream. Strong oscillations in the M-shape flame are found
due to the dilution of the main air to the pilot methane flame. (2) In the main
flame mode, the main flame is lifted off from the burner if the pilot stage is
supplied with air. The temperature of the primary recirculation zone drops
substantially and the unsteady heat release is intensified. (3) In the
stratified flame mode, unique beating oscillations exhibiting dual
closely-spaced frequencies in the pressure spectrum. is found. This is observed
within over narrow window of equivalence ratio combinations between the pilot
and main stages. Detailed analysis of the experimental data shows that flame
dynamics and thermoacoustic couplings at these two frequencies are similar to
those of the unstable pilot flame and the attached main flame cases,
respectively. Large Eddy Simulations (LESs) are carried out with OpenFOAM to
understand the mechanisms of the time averaged flame shapes in different
operating modes. Finally, a simple acoustic analysis is proposed to understand
the acoustic mode nature of the beating oscillations.

present study aim is to answer the following research question namely What is
the small data problem in machine learning and how it is solved?. Our
bibliometric study showed a positive trend in the number of research
publications concerning the use of small datasets and substantial growth of the
research community dealing with the small dataset problem, indicating that the
research field is moving toward higher maturity levels. Despite notable
international cooperation, the regional concentration of research literature
production in economically more developed countries was observed.

supercritical bifurcation of combustion instabilities triggered by the air
inlet temperature (Ta). The studies are performed with a pressurised kerosene
fuelled Lean Premixed Prevaporized (LPP) combustor operated under elevated
temperature. Unlike some previous studies, starting from an unstable condition
of the system, the amplitude of combustion instabilities suddenly decrease when
Ta exceeds a critical value of Ta =570 K. When the temperature is lowered back
the system returns to being unstable without featuring any hysteresis
behaviour, as expected in case of a supercritical bifurcation. The unstable
flames feature a periodic axial motion of lift-off and re-ignition,
characterized as Helmholtz mode. The phase difference between chemiluminescence
and pressure signals is found to increase with Ta, exceeding 90 degrees (out of
phase) for temperatures higher than 570 K. A low order network framework is
conducted, illustrating that when Ta is increased a stability shift of this
mode is predicted at Ta near 570 K, in good agreement with the experimental
observations. The impact of Ta on the spray characteristics is also examined,
finding that higher Ta promotes fuel evaporation and reduces equivalence ratio
fluctuation at the exit of the swirler.

policies for locomotion control that are as effective as a typical multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), with superior transfer and multi-task performance (Wang et
al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020). Results have so far been limited to training on
small agents, with the performance of GNNs deteriorating rapidly as the number
of sensors and actuators grows. A key motivation for the use of GNNs in the
supervised learning setting is their applicability to large graphs, but this
benefit has not yet been realised for locomotion control. We identify the
weakness with a common GNN architecture that causes this poor scaling:
overfitting in the MLPs within the network that encode, decode, and propagate
messages. To combat this, we introduce Snowflake, a GNN training method for
high-dimensional continuous control that freezes parameters in parts of the
network that suffer from overfitting. Snowflake significantly boosts the
performance of GNNs for locomotion control on large agents, now matching the
performance of MLPs, and with superior transfer properties.

i.e., time-invariant, horizon length and cost functions. If no stabilizing
terminal ingredients are used, stability can be guaranteed via a sufficiently
long horizon. A suboptimality index can be derived that gives bounds on the
performance of the MPC law over an infinite-horizon (IH). While for
time-invariant schemes such index can be computed offline, less attention has
been paid to time-varying strategies with adapting cost function which can be
found, e.g., in learning-based optimal control. This work addresses the
performance bounds of nonlinear MPC with stabilizing horizon and time-varying
terminal cost. A scheme is proposed that uses the decay of the optimal
finite-horizon cost and convolutes a history stack to predict the bounds on the
IH performance. Based on online information on the decay rate, the performance
bound estimate is improved while the terminal cost is adapted using methods
from adaptive dynamic programming. The adaptation of the terminal cost leads to
performance improvement over a time-invariant scheme with the same horizon
length. The approach is demonstrated in a case study.

individuals' ability to improve in strategic learning settings. Inspired by
real-life settings, such as loan approvals and college admissions, we remove
the assumption typically made in the strategic learning literature, that the
decision rule is fully known to individuals, and focus instead on settings
where it is inaccessible. In their lack of knowledge, individuals try to infer
this rule by learning from their peers (e.g., friends and acquaintances who
previously applied for a loan), naturally forming groups in the population,
each with possibly different type and level of information regarding the
decision rule. We show that, in equilibrium, the principal's decision rule
optimizing welfare across sub-populations may cause a strong negative
externality: the true quality of some of the groups can actually deteriorate.
On the positive side, we show that, in many natural cases, optimal improvement
can be guaranteed simultaneously for all sub-populations. We further introduce
a measure we term information overlap proxy, and demonstrate its usefulness in
characterizing the disparity in improvements across sub-populations. Finally,
we identify a natural condition under which improvement can be guaranteed for

Engines (LREs) and gas turbines. During this PhD work, several directions were
explored to understand and mitigate their effects. First, more efficient and
robust numerical methods for their prediction in complex combustors were
designed. In this matter, a novel type of modal expansion, named a frame
expansion and comparable to the classical Galerkin expansion, was introduced to
build more accurate acoustic Low-Order Models (LOMs), able to account for the
full geometrical complexity of industrial combustors. In particular, the frame
expansion is able to accurately represent the acoustic velocity field near
non-rigid-wall boundaries, a crucial ability that the Galerkin method lacks. An
entire class of novel numerical methods, based on the frame expansion, were
then designed and combined with the state-space formalism to build acoustic
networks of complex systems. The second ingredient in the prediction of
thermoacoustic instabilities is the flame dynamics modeling. This work dealt
with this problem, in the specific case of a cryogenic coaxial jet-flame
characteristic of a LRE. Flame dynamics driving phenomena were identified
thanks to three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of the Mascotte
experimental test rig where both reactants (CH4 and O2) are injected in
transcritical conditions. Several LES with harmonic modulation of the fuel
inflow at various frequencies and amplitudes were performed in order to
evaluate the flame response to acoustic oscillations and compute a Flame
Transfer Function (FTF). The stabilization of this flame in the near-injector
region, which is of primary importance on the overall flame dynamics, was also
investigated thanks to multi-physics two-dimensional Direct Numerical
Simulations (DNS), where a conjugate heat transfer problem is resolved at the
injector lip.

dense filamentary cloud. Methods: [CII] observations of RCW36 covering an area
of ~30 arcmin$\times$30 arcmin were carried out with a Fabry-P\'{e}rot
spectrometer aboard a 100-cm balloon-borne far-infrared (IR) telescope with an
angular resolution of 90 arcsec. By using AKARI and Herschel images, the
spatial distribution of the [CII] intensity was compared with those of emission
from the large grains and PAH. Results: The [CII] emission is spatially in good
agreement with shell-like structures of a bipolar lobe observed in IR images,
which extend along the direction perpendicular to the direction of a cold dense
filament. We found that the [CII]--160 $\mu$m relation for RCW36 shows higher
brightness ratio of [CII]/160 $\mu$m than that for RCW 38, while the [CII]--9
$\mu$m relation for RCW36 is in good agreement with that for RCW38.
Conclusions: The [CII] emission spatially well correlates with PAH and cold
dust emissions. This means that the observed [CII] emission dominantly comes
from PDRs. Moreover, the L_[CII]/L_FIR ratio shows large variation compared
with the L_[CII]/L_PAH ratio. In view of the observed tight correlation between
L_[CII]/L_FIR and the optical depth at $\lambda$=160 $\mu$m, the large
variation in L_[CII]/L_FIR can be simply explained by the geometrical effect,
viz., L_FIR has contributions from the entire dust-cloud column along the line
of sight, while L_[CII] has contributions from far-UV illuminated cloud
surfaces. Based on the picture of the geometry effect, the enhanced brightness
ratio of [CII]/160 $\mu$m is attributed to the difference in gas structures
where massive stars are formed: filamentary (RCW36) and clumpy (RCW38)
molecular clouds and thus suggests that RCW36 is dominated by far-UV
illuminated cloud surfaces compared with RCW38.

and store in a neural network's weights? Too much, and the network would
overfit to the training data. Too little, and the network would not fit to
anything at all. Na\""ively, the amount of information the network stores should
scale in proportion to the number of trainable weights. This raises the
question: how can neural networks with vastly more weights than training data
still generalise? A simple resolution to this conundrum is that the number of
weights is usually a bad proxy for the actual amount of information stored. For
instance, typical weight vectors may be highly compressible. Then another
question occurs: is it possible to compute the actual amount of information
stored? This paper derives both a consistent estimator and a closed-form upper
bound on the information content of infinitely wide neural networks. The
derivation is based on an identification between neural information content and
the negative log probability of a Gaussian orthant. This identification yields
bounds that analytically control the generalisation behaviour of the entire
solution space of infinitely wide networks. The bounds have a simple dependence
on both the network architecture and the training data. Corroborating the
findings of Valle-P\'erez et al. (2019), who conducted a similar analysis using
approximate Gaussian integration techniques, the bounds are found to be both
non-vacuous and correlated with the empirical generalisation behaviour at
finite width.

this paper proposes the Dual Attention Suppression (DAS) attack to generate
visually-natural physical adversarial camouflages with strong transferability
by suppressing both model and human attention. As for attacking, we generate
transferable adversarial camouflages by distracting the model-shared similar
attention patterns from the target to non-target regions. Meanwhile, based on
the fact that human visual attention always focuses on salient items (e.g.,
suspicious distortions), we evade the human-specific bottom-up attention to
generate visually-natural camouflages which are correlated to the scenario
context. We conduct extensive experiments in both the digital and physical

Specifically, we determine the binding energy of the $H$ dibaryon at a single
quark-mass point. The calculation is performed at six values of the lattice
spacing $a$, using O($a$)-improved Wilson fermions at the SU(3)-symmetric point
with $m_\pi=m_K\approx 420$ MeV. Energy levels are extracted by applying a
variational method to correlation matrices of bilocal two-baryon interpolating
operators computed using the distillation technique. Our analysis employs
L\""uscher's finite-volume quantization condition to determine the scattering
phase shifts from the spectrum and vice versa, both above and below the
two-baryon threshold. We perform global fits to the lattice spectra using
parametrizations of the phase shift, supplemented by terms describing
discretization effects, then extrapolate the lattice spacing to zero. The phase
shift and the binding energy determined from it are found to be strongly
affected by lattice artifacts. Our estimate of the binding energy in the
continuum limit of three-flavor QCD is $B_H^{\text{SU(3)}_{\rm

match pixels and points, a dual fully convolutional framework is presented that
maps 2D and 3D inputs into a shared latent representation space to
simultaneously describe and detect keypoints. Furthermore, an ultra-wide
reception mechanism in combination with a novel loss function are designed to
mitigate the intrinsic information variations between pixel and point local

as a promising optoelectronic platform. To leverage their full potential,
however, it is important to understand and engineer the properties of the
different exciton species that exist in these monolayers, as well as to control
their transport through the material. A promising approach relies on
engineering strain landscapes in atomically thin semiconductors that excitons
navigate. In WSe$_2$ monolayers, for example, localized strain has been used to
control the emission wavelength of excitons, induce exciton funneling and
conversion, and even realize single-photon sources and quantum dots. Before
these phenomena can be fully leveraged for applications, including quantum
information processing, the details of excitons' interaction with the strain
landscape must be well understood. To address this, we have developed a
cryogenic technique capable of probing the dynamics of both bright and dark
excitons in nanoscale strain landscapes in TMDs. In our approach, a
nanosculpted tapered optical fiber is used to simultaneously generate strain
and probe the near-field optical response of WSe$_2$ monolayers at 5 K. When
the monolayer is pushed by the fiber, its lowest energy photoluminescence (PL)
peaks red shift by as much as 390 meV, (corresponding to 20% of the bandgap of
an unstrained WSe$_2$ monolayer). The red-shifting peaks are polarized
perpendicularly to the WSe$_2$ plane and have long rising times (10 ps) and
lifetimes (52 ps), indicating that they originate from nominally spin-forbidden
dark excitons. Taken together, these observations indicate that dark excitons
are funneled to the high-strain regions during their long lifetime and are the
principal participants in drift and diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Our
work elucidates the important role that dark excitons play in locally strained
WSe$_2$.

implement a mesoscale elasto-plastic model based on a solid-mechanics
description. The latter is extended to consider the anisotropy of the yield
surface via statistically distributed local and discrete weak planes on which
shear transformations can be activated. To make the comparison as quantitative
as possible, we consider the simple case of a quasistatically driven
two-dimensional system in the stationary flow state and compare mechanical
observables measured on both models over the same length scales. We show that
the macroscale response, including its fluctuations, can be quantitatively
recovered for a range of elasto-plastic mesoscale parameters. Using a newly
developed method that makes it possible to probe the local yield stresses in
atomistic simulations, we calibrate the local mechanical response of the
elasto-plastic model at different coarse-graining scales. In this case, the
calibration shows a qualitative agreement only for an optimized subset of
mesoscale parameters and for sufficiently coarse probing length scales. This
calibration allows us to establish a length scale for the mesoscopic elements
that corresponds to an upper bound of the shear transformation size, a key
physical parameter in elasto-plastic models. We find that certain properties
naturally emerge from the elasto-plastic model. In particular, we show that the
elasto-plastic model reproduces the Bauschinger effect, namely the
plasticity-induced anisotropy in the stress-strain response. We discuss the
successes and failures of our approach, the impact of different model

data from decaying isotropic turbulence, a Taylor-Green vortex flow, and a
turbulent channel flow. Defining the compression ratio (CR) as the ratio of
original data size to the compressed one, the results show that our model based
on vector quantization can offer CR$=85$ with a mean square error (MSE) of
$O(10^{-3})$, and predictions that faithfully reproduce the statistics of the
flow, except at the very smallest scales where there is some loss. Compared to
the recent study of Glaws. et. al. (Physical Review Fluids, 5(11):114602,
2020), which was based on a conventional autoencoder (where compression is
performed in a continuous space), our model improves the CR by more than $30$
percent...

(OmniNet). In OmniNet, instead of maintaining a strictly horizontal receptive
field, each token is allowed to attend to all tokens in the entire network.
This process can also be interpreted as a form of extreme or intensive
attention mechanism that has the receptive field of the entire width and depth
of the network. To this end, the omnidirectional attention is learned via a
meta-learner, which is essentially another self-attention based model. In order
to mitigate the computationally expensive costs of full receptive field
attention, we leverage efficient self-attention models such as kernel-based
(Choromanski et al.), low-rank attention (Wang et al.) and/or Big Bird (Zaheer
et al.) as the meta-learner. Extensive experiments are conducted on
autoregressive language modeling (LM1B, C4), Machine Translation, Long Range
Arena (LRA), and Image Recognition. The experiments show that OmniNet achieves
considerable improvements across these tasks, including achieving
state-of-the-art performance on LM1B, WMT'14 En-De/En-Fr, and Long Range Arena.
Moreover, using omnidirectional representation in Vision Transformers leads to
significant improvements on image recognition tasks on both few-shot learning
and fine-tuning setups.

both high thermal and magnetic field energy density. Characterization of such
plasma is challenging but needed for understanding of its physical behaviour.
Among all standard experimental techniques for plasma diagnostics, classical
interferometry is one of the most convenient, informative and accurate.
Attempts to extract more information from each single laser shot have led to
development of complex interferometry, which under certain processing allows to
reconstruct both plasma electron density and magnetic field strength
distributions using just one data object. However, the increase in complexity
and universality of the diagnostics requires a more detailed analysis of the
extracted values and their accuracy.This work focuses on axisymmetric
interaction geometry. We present general analysis, starting from the basic
principles and trace main error sources, finally ending up with plasma density
and magnetic field distributions with the derived error bars. Use of synthetic
profiles makes the analysis universal, though we present an example with real

object detection with few labeled samples. To alleviate the constraint of few
samples, enhancing the generalization ability of learned features for novel
objects plays a key role. Thus, the feature learning process of FSOD should
focus more on intrinsical object characteristics, which are invariant under
different visual changes and therefore are helpful for feature generalization.
Unlike previous attempts of the meta-learning paradigm, in this paper, we
explore how to enhance object features with intrinsical characteristics that
are universal across different object categories. We propose a new prototype,
namely universal prototype, that is learned from all object categories. Besides
the advantage of characterizing invariant characteristics, the universal
prototypes alleviate the impact of unbalanced object categories. After
enhancing object features with the universal prototypes, we impose a
consistency loss to maximize the agreement between the enhanced features and
the original ones, which is beneficial for learning invariant object
characteristics. Thus, we develop a new framework of few-shot object detection
with universal prototypes ({FSOD}^{up}) that owns the merit of feature
generalization towards novel objects. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and MS
COCO show the effectiveness of {FSOD}^{up}. Particularly, for the 1-shot case
of VOC Split2, {FSOD}^{up} outperforms the baseline by 6.8% in terms of mAP.

consider a binary mixture of charged Lennard-Jones particles and vary the
partial charges of the particles, and thus, the high-temperature activation
energy and the glass transition temperature of the system. Based on previous
results, we introduce a phenomenological model describing relaxation times over
the whole temperature regime from high temperatures to temperatures well inside
the supercooled regime. By investigating the dynamics of both particle species
on molecular and diffusive length scales along isochoric and isobaric pathways,
we find a quadratic charge dependence of both $E_{\infty}$ and $T_{\text{g}}$,
resulting in an approximately constant ratio of both quantities independent of
the underlying observable, the thermodynamic ensemble, and the particle
species, and this result is robust against the actual definition of
$T_{\text{g}}$. This generic relation between the activation energy and the
glass transition temperature indicates that high-temperature dynamics and the
glassy slowdown are related phenomena, and the knowledge of $E_{\infty}$ may
allow to approximately predict $T_{\text{g}}$.

make numerous design choices -- such as the selection of variational objective
and approximating family -- yet there is little principled guidance on how to
do so. We develop a conceptual framework and set of experimental tools to
understand the effects of these choices, which we leverage to propose best
practices for maximizing posterior approximation accuracy. Our approach is
based on studying the pre-asymptotic tail behavior of the density ratios
between the joint distribution and the variational approximation, then
exploiting insights and tools from the importance sampling literature. Our
framework and supporting experiments help to distinguish between the behavior
of BBVI methods for approximating low-dimensional versus
moderate-to-high-dimensional posteriors. In the latter case, we show that
mass-covering variational objectives are difficult to optimize and do not
improve accuracy, but flexible variational families can improve accuracy and
the effectiveness of importance sampling -- at the cost of additional
optimization challenges. Therefore, for moderate-to-high-dimensional posteriors
we recommend using the (mode-seeking) exclusive KL divergence since it is the
easiest to optimize, and improving the variational family or using model
parameter transformations to make the posterior and optimal variational
approximation more similar. On the other hand, in low-dimensional settings, we
show that heavy-tailed variational families and mass-covering divergences are
effective and can increase the chances that the approximation can be improved
by importance sampling.

unresolved complications such as high variances and limited theoretical

neighbor sampling as a multi-armed bandit problem but with a newly-designed
reward function that introduces some degree of bias designed to reduce variance
and avoid unstable, possibly-unbounded pay outs. And unlike prior bandit-GNN
use cases, the resulting policy leads to near-optimal regret while accounting
for the GNN training dynamics introduced by SGD. From a practical standpoint,
this translates into lower variance estimates and competitive or superior test
accuracy across several benchmarks.

(HVACs) and electric vehicles (EVs) have great potentials to provide demand
flexibility which is an attribute of Grid-interactive Efficient Buildings

developed in this paper to represent the fleet of GEBs, in which the aggregated
parameters are obtained based on a new approach of data generation and
least-squares parameter estimation (DG-LSPE), which can deal with heterogenous
HVACs. Then, a tri-level bidding and dispatching framework is established based
on competitive distribution operation with distribution locational marginal
price (DLMP). The first two levels form a bilevel model to optimize the
aggregators payment and to represent the interdependency between load
aggregators and the distribution system operator (DSO) using DLMP, while the
third level is to dispatch the optimal load aggregation to all residents by the
proposed priority list-based demand dispatching algorithm. Finally, case
studies on a modified IEEE 33-Bus system illustrate three main technical
reasons for payment reduction due to demand flexibility: load shift, DLMP step
changes, and power losses. They can be used as general guidelines for better
decision-making for future planning and operation of demand response programs.

what they do the gender typicality of their behavior in open source programming

we replicate our findings on another platform with a markedly different focus
Behance, a community for graphic artists. We also study attention as a new
outcome on both platforms. We found that female typicality of behavior is a
significant negative predictor of attention, success, and survival on creative

We found support for the visibility paradox of women in technical fields while
female typicality of behaviors is negatively related to attention, being female
predicts a higher level of attention. We quantified the indirect impact of
gender homophily on success via gendered behavior that accounts for 37 percent
of the disadvantage of women in success. Our findings suggest that the negative

their balance between accuracy and speed. Unlike classification-based CNNs,
deep similarity networks are specifically designed to address the image

this paper, we argue that using a single convolutional layer as feature

present a Multiple Features-Siamese Tracker (MFST), a novel tracking algorithm
exploiting several hierarchical feature maps for robust tracking. Since
convolutional layers provide several abstraction levels in characterizing an
object, fusing hierarchical features allows to obtain a richer and more
efficient representation of the target. Moreover, we handle the target
appearance variations by calibrating the deep features extracted from two
different CNN models. Based on this advanced feature representation, our method
achieves high tracking accuracy, while outperforming the standard siamese

require that a growing network be observed across at least two snapshots in

previously unnoticed bias that arises when estimating preferential attachment
values only for degrees observed in the single snapshot. Our work provides a

attachment in three such networks, and found sublinear preferential attachment
in all cases. PAFit-oneshot is implemented in the R package PAFit.

high-efficient root cause localization is thus a critical challenge for
large-scale industrial microservice systems. Existing approaches use service
dependency graph based analysis techniques to automatically locate root causes.
However, these approaches are limited due to their inaccurate detection of
service anomalies and inefficient traversing of service dependency graph. In
this paper, we propose a high-efficient root cause localization approach for
availability issues of microservice systems, called MicroHECL. Based on a
dynamically constructed service call graph, MicroHECL analyzes possible anomaly
propagation chains, and ranks candidate root causes based on correlation
analysis. We combine machine learning and statistical methods and design
customized models for the detection of different types of service anomalies
(i.e., performance, reliability, traffic). To improve the efficiency, we adopt
a pruning strategy to eliminate irrelevant service calls in anomaly propagation
chain analysis. Experimental studies show that MicroHECL significantly
outperforms two state-of-the-art baseline approaches in terms of both accuracy
and efficiency. MicroHECL has been used in Alibaba and achieves a top-3 hit
ratio of 68% with root cause localization time reduced from 30 minutes to 5

low-cost intelligent mirror system that can display a variety of details based
on user recommendations. Therefore, in this article, Internet of Things (IoT)
and AI-based smart mirror is introduced that will support the users to receive
the necessary daily update of weather information, date, time, calendar, to-do

  Elimination based Compositional Reasoning and Verification","13 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper presents our research on quantifier elimination (QE) for
compositional reasoning and verification. For compositional reasoning, QE
provides the foundation of our approach, serving as the calculus for
composition to derive the strongest system-property in a single step, from the
given component atomic-properties and their interconnection relation. We first
developed this framework for time-independent properties, and later extended it
to time-dependent property composition. The extension requires, in addition,
shifting the given properties along time to span the time horizon of interest,
he least of which for the strongest system-property is no more than the total
time horizons of the component level atomic-properties. The
system-initial-condition is also composed from atomic-initial-conditions of the
components the same way. It is used to verify a desired system-level property,
alongside the derived strongest system-property, by way of induction. Our
composition approach is uniform regardless of the composition types
(cascade/parallel/feedback) for both time-dependent and time-independent
properties.
  We developed a new prototype verifier named ReLIC (Reduced Logic Inference
for Composition) that implements our above approaches. We demonstrated it
through several illustrative and practical examples. Further, we advanced the
$k$-induction based model-checking with QE capabilities, by formulating its
base and inductive steps into QE problems where all the variables are
universally quantified. Our integration of the QE solver Redlog with the
$k$-induction based model-checking tool JKind, shows the successful solving of
a non-linear problem that the SMT capable JKind failed to resolve. Finally, we
also showcase the recent adoption of our approaches within an industrial V\&V
tool suite for augmented static analysis of Simulink models and Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs).

processing by advanced graph data mining algorithms. In this paper, based on
the classic Limited Penetrable Visibility Graph (LPVG) method, we propose a
novel nonlinear mapping method named Circular Limited Penetrable Visibility
Graph (CLPVG). The testing on degree distribution and clustering coefficient on
the generated graphs of typical time series validates that our CLPVG is able to
effectively capture the important features of time series and has better
anti-noise ability than traditional LPVG. The experiments on real-world
time-series datasets of radio signal and electroencephalogram (EEG) also
suggest that the structural features provided by CLPVG, rather than LPVG, are
more useful for time-series classification, leading to higher accuracy. And
this classification performance can be further enhanced through structural
feature expansion by adopting Subgraph Networks (SGN). All of these results
validate the effectiveness of our CLPVG model.

in search engines as a query and document encoder. This embedding enables a
semantic similarity score between queries and documents that can be an
important feature in document ranking and relevancy. To train such a customized
sentence encoder, it is beneficial to leverage users search data in the form of
query-document clicked pairs however, we must avoid relying too much on search
click data as it is biased and does not cover many unseen cases. The search
data is heavily skewed towards short queries and for long queries is small and
often noisy. The goal is to design a universal multi-lingual encoder that works
for all cases and covers both short and long queries. We select a number of
public NLI datasets in different languages and translation data and together
with user search data we train a language model using a multi-task approach. A
challenge is that these datasets are not homogeneous in terms of content, size
and the balance ratio. While the public NLI datasets are usually two-sentence
based with the same portion of positive and negative pairs, the user search
data can contain multi-sentence documents and only positive pairs. We show how
multi-task training enables us to leverage all these datasets and exploit
knowledge sharing across these tasks.

condensation of DNA into very well-defined toroidal shapes have been well
studied and understood. However, a great effort has been made trying to obtain
similar condensed structures from either ssRNA or dsRNA, which the latter
carries similar negative charge density as dsDNA, although it adopts a
different helical form. But the analogous condensation of RNA molecules into
well-defined structures has so far been elusive. In this work, we show that
ssRNA molecules can easily be condensed into nanoring structures on a mice
surface, where each nanoring structure is formed mostly by a single RNA
molecule. The condensation occurs in a concentration range of different atomic
cations, from monovalent to trivalent. The structures of the RNA nanorings on
mica surfaces were oberved by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The samples were
observed in tapping mode and were prepared by drop evaporation of a solution of
RNA in the presence of one type of the different cations used. As far as we
know, this is the first time that nanorings or any other well-defined condensed
RNA structures have been reported. The RNA nanorings formation can be
understood by an energy competition between the hydrogen bonding forming
hairpin stems, weakened by the salts, and hairpin loops. This results may have
an important biological relevance, since it has been proposed that RNA is the
oldest genome coding molecule and the formation of these structures could have
given it stability against degradation in primeval times. Even more, the
nanoring structures could have the potential to be used as biosensors and
functionalized nanodevices.
