way software is being developed. The Scrum approach emphasizes the active
end-user involvement, embracing of change, and /iterative delivery of products.
Our study showed that Scrum has different variants or is used in combination
with different methods. Some tools not normally used in the conventional
software approaches, like gamification, content analysis and grounded theory
are also employed. However, Scrum like other software development approach
focuses on improvement of software process, software quality, business value,
performance, usability and efficiency and at the same time to reduce cost, risk
and uncertainty. Contrary to some conventional approaches it also strives to
boost soft factors like agility, trust, motivation, responsibility and
transparency. The bibliometric synthetic scoping study revealed seven main
research themes concerned with the Scrum research.

features in a source input instance so that it is classified as a target class
under a given classifier. This has become a topic of recent interest as a way
to query a trained model and suggest possible actions to overturn its decision.
Mathematically, the problem is formally equivalent to that of finding
adversarial examples, which also has attracted significant attention recently.
Most work on either counterfactual explanations or adversarial examples has
focused on differentiable classifiers, such as neural nets. We focus on
classification trees, both axis-aligned and oblique (having hyperplane splits).
Although here the counterfactual optimization problem is nonconvex and
nondifferentiable, we show that an exact solution can be computed very
efficiently, even with high-dimensional feature vectors and with both
continuous and categorical features, and demonstrate it in different datasets
and settings. The results are particularly relevant for finance, medicine or
legal applications, where interpretability and counterfactual explanations are
particularly important.

reduction of the data using tangent space coordinates. Leveraging the fact that
the corresponding manifolds are submanifolds of unit Hilbert spheres, we
describe how finite-dimensional representations of the functional data objects

canonical correlation analysis methods. We further construct and visualize
canonical variate directions directly on the space of densities or shapes.
Utility of the method is demonstrated through numerical simulations and

predicting object depth, which must be inferred from object and scene cues due
to the lack of direct range measurement. Many methods attempt to directly

the development of mathematical models for the simulation of the epidemic, and
of disease models generally. Most works follow the susceptible-infected-removed
(SIR) compartmental framework, modeling the epidemic with a system of ordinary
differential equations. Alternative formulations using a partial differential
equation (PDE) to incorporate both spatial and temporal resolution have also
been introduced, with their numerical results showing potentially powerful
descriptive and predictive capacity. In the present work, we introduce a new
variation to such models by using delay differential equations (DDEs). The
dynamics of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19, exhibit delays due to
incubation periods and related phenomena. Accordingly, DDE models allow for a
natural representation of the problem dynamics, in addition to offering
advantages in terms of computational time and modeling, as they eliminate the
need for additional, difficult-to-estimate, compartments (such as exposed
individuals) to incorporate time delays. Here, we introduce a DDE epidemic
model in both an ordinary- and partial differential equation framework. We
present a series of mathematical results assessing the stability of the
formulation. We then perform several numerical experiments, validating both the
mathematical results and establishing model's ability to reproduce measured
data on realistic problems.

local chemical bond fluctuations and conformational changes driven by
long-range electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. This interplay
between interactions yields complex potential-energy surfaces (PES) with
multiple minima and transition paths between them. In this work, we assess the
performance of state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models, namely sGDML,
SchNet, GAP/SOAP, and BPNN for reproducing such PES, while using limited
amounts of reference data. As a benchmark, we use the cis to trans thermal
relaxation in an azobenzene molecule, where at least three different transition
mechanisms should be considered. Although GAP/SOAP, SchNet, and sGDML models
can globally achieve chemical accuracy of 1 kcal mol-1 with fewer than 1000
training points, predictions greatly depend on the ML method used as well as
the local region of the PES being sampled. Within a given ML method, large
differences can be found between predictions of close-to-equilibrium and
transition regions, as well as for different transition mechanisms. We identify
key challenges that the ML models face in learning long-range interactions and
the intrinsic limitations of commonly used atom-based descriptors. All in all,
our results suggest switching from learning the entire PES within a single
model to using multiple local models with optimized descriptors, training sets,
and architectures for different parts of complex PES.

waves which rich order parameter allows for an unusual object of a complex
topological nature: a half-integer dislocation combined with a semi-vortex of
the staggered magnetization. It becomes energetically preferable with respect
to an ordinary dislocation due to the high Coulomb energy at low concentration
of carriers. Generation of these objects should form a sequence of pi-phase
slips in accordance with experimental doubling of phase-slips rate. Next, we
revise the commonly employed TDGL approach which is shown to suffer from a
violation of the charge conservation law resulting in nonphysical generation of
particles which is particularly pronounced for electronic vortices in the
course of their nucleation or motion. The suggested consistent theory exploits
the chiral transformations taking into account the principle contribution of
the fermionic chiral anomaly to the effective action. The derived equations
clarify partitions of charges,currents and rigidity among subsystems of the
condensate and normal carriers and the gluing electric field. Being
non-analytical with respect to the order parameter, contrarily the conventional
TDGL type, the resulting equations still allow for a numerical modeling of
transient processes related to space- and spatio-temporal vorticity in DWs.

of 2D materials. In this paper we experimentally study the directional
photoluminescence emission from Tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer sandwiched
between a single-crystalline plasmonic silver nanowire (AgNW) waveguide and a
gold (Au) mirror, thus forming an AgNW-WS2-Au cavity. By employing
polarization-resolved Fourier plane optical microscopy, we quantify the
directional emission characteristics from the distal end of the AgNW-WS2-Au
cavity. Given that our geometry simultaneously facilitates local field
enhancement and waveguiding capability, we envisage its utility in 2D
material-based, on-chip nanophotonic signal processing, including nonlinear and
quantum optical regimes.

This method is inspired by the concept that warped parts of two time series

  Short-Term Memory Networks","12 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The beginning of 2021 saw a surge in volatility for certain stocks such as
GameStop company stock (Ticker GME under NYSE). GameStop stock increased around
10 fold from its decade-long average to its peak at \$485. In this paper, we
hypothesize a buy-and-hold strategy can be outperformed in the presence of
extreme volatility by predicting and trading consolidation breakouts. We
investigate GME stock for its volatility and compare it to SPY as a benchmark
(since it is a less volatile ETF fund) from February 2002 to February 2021. For
strategy 1, we develop a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to
predict stock prices recurrently with a very short look ahead period in the
presence of extreme volatility. For our strategy 2, we develop an LSTM
autoencoder network specifically designed to trade only on consolidation
breakouts after predicting anomalies in the stock price. When back-tested in
our simulations, our strategy 1 executes 863 trades for SPY and 452 trades for
GME. Our strategy 2 executes 931 trades for SPY and 325 trades for GME. We
compare both strategies to buying and holding one single share for the period
that we picked as a benchmark. In our simulations, SPY returns \$281.160 from
buying and holding one single share, \$110.29 from strategy 1 with 53.5%
success rate and \$4.34 from strategy 2 with 57.6% success rate. GME returns
\$45.63 from buying and holding one single share, \$69.046 from strategy 1 with
47.12% success rate and \$2.10 from strategy 2 with 48% success rate. Overall,
buying and holding outperforms all deep-learning assisted prediction models in
our study except for when the LSTM-based prediction model (strategy 1) is
applied to GME. We hope that our study sheds more light into the field of
extreme volatility predictions based on LSTMs to outperform buying and holding

several filtering methods have been proposed in the literature to fix the

transform the correlation matrix maintaining the Mean-Variance Optimization

adequately effective when applied to real financial datasets.

Combinatorial Optimization. We advance a new Mixed Integer Quadratic

first predicts the target category from the language descriptions using a
simple language classification model. Then, based on the category, our model
sifts out a small number of instance candidates (usually less than 20) from the
panoptic segmentation of point clouds. Thus, the non-trivial 3D visual
grounding task has been effectively re-formulated as a simplified
instance-matching problem, considering that instance-level candidates are more
rational than the redundant 3D object proposals. Subsequently, for each
candidate, we perform the multi-level contextual inference, i.e., referring
from instance attribute perception, instance-to-instance relation perception,
and instance-to-background global localization perception, respectively.
Eventually, the most relevant candidate is selected and localized by ranking
confidence scores, which are obtained by the cooperative holistic
visual-language feature matching. Experiments confirm that our method
outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on ScanRefer online benchmark and

is thus important to optimize the overall spending. This problem can be
mathematically formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem where one
wishes to minimize the cost of providing incentives while ensuring a desired
level of cooperation within the population. In this paper, we provide a
rigorous analysis for this problem. We study cooperation dilemmas in both the
pairwise (the Donation game) and multi-player (the Public Goods game) settings.
We prove the regularity of the (total incentive) cost function, characterize
its asymptotic limits (infinite population, weak selection and large selection)
and show exactly when reward or punishment is more efficient. We prove that the
cost function exhibits a phase transition phenomena when the intensity of
selection varies. We calculate the critical threshold in regards to the phase
transition and study the optimization problem when the intensity of selection
is under and above the critical value. It allows us to provide an exact
calculation for the optimal cost of incentive, for a given intensity of
selection. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the
analytical results. Overall, our analysis provides for the first time a
selection-dependent calculation of the optimal cost of institutional incentives
(for both reward and punishment) that guarantees a minimum amount of
cooperation. It is of crucial importance for real-world applications of
institutional incentives since intensity of selection is specific to a given

recursive updating often leads to poor trade-off solutions across tasks because
approximate inference is necessary for most models of interest. Here, we
describe an alternative Bayesian approach where task-conditioned parameter
distributions are continually inferred from data. We offer a practical deep
learning implementation of our framework based on probabilistic
task-conditioned hypernetworks, an approach we term posterior meta-replay.
Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our probabilistic hypernetworks
compress sequences of posterior parameter distributions with virtually no

While many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, they only
utilize source data during training but do not take advantage of the fact that
a single target example is available at the time of inference. Motivated by
this, we propose a method that effectively uses the target sample during
inference beyond mere classification. Our method has three components - (i) A
label-preserving feature or metric transformation on source data such that the
source samples are clustered in accordance with their class irrespective of
their domain (ii) A generative model trained on the these features (iii) A
label-preserving projection of the target point on the source-feature manifold
during inference via solving an optimization problem on the input space of the
generative model using the learned metric. Finally, the projected target is
used in the classifier. Since the projected target feature comes from the
source manifold and has the same label as the real target by design, the
classifier is expected to perform better on it than the true target. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Domain

cavity define a closed cycle between several ground and excited states of a
single atom. We show that, for strong atom-cavity coupling and steady-state
driving, the entanglement between the atomic states and intracavity photon
number suppresses the excited-state population via quantum interference,
effectively reducing the cycle to the atomic ground states. The system dynamics
then result from transitions within a harmonic ladder of entangled dark states,
one for each cavity photon number, and a quantum Zeno blockade that generates
antibunching in the photons emitted from the cavity. The reduced cycle
suppresses unwanted optical pumping into atomic states outside the cycle,
thereby enhancing the number of emitted photons.

from more sophisticated MOND versions such as AQUAL or QMOND, created to expand
MOND heuristic law and preserve the conservation of momentum, angular momentum,

based on Milgrom's proposal to calculate semianalytically (without numerical

applying it to different models of thin disks. The application of this

field may be used in a Newtonian way to calculate iteratively the MOND
accelerations. In most cases, the differences between the application of the
simple algebraic rule and the AQUAL-MOND calculations are small, $\lesssim 5$%.
However, the error of the algebraic solution is larger than 5% when more than
half of the mass is in the MONDian regime (where Newtonian and MOND rotation
speeds differ by more than 10%), reaching in some cases $>70$% discrepance,

  Mining Software Repositories, MSR '21",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate on
projects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research focuses on
activities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the code
brought to or created during a hackathon. Aim: We aim to understand the
evolution of hackathon-related code, specifically, how much hackathon teams
rely on pre-existing code or how much new code they develop during a hackathon.
Moreover, we aim to understand if and where that code gets reused, and what
factors affect reuse. Method: We collected information about 22,183 hackathon
projects from DEVPOST -- a hackathon database -- and obtained related code
(blobs), authors, and project characteristics from the World of Code. We
investigated if code blobs in hackathon projects were created before, during,
or after an event by identifying the original blob creation date and author,
and also checked if the original author was a hackathon project member. We
tracked code reuse by first identifying all commits containing blobs created
during an event before determining all projects that contain those commits.
Result: While only approximately 9.14% of the code blobs are created during
hackathons, this amount is still significant considering the time and member
constraints of such events. Approximately a third of these code blobs get
reused in other projects. The number of associated technologies and the number
of participants in a project increase reuse probability. Conclusion: Our study
demonstrates to what extent pre-existing code is used and new code is created
during a hackathon and how much of it is reused elsewhere afterwards. Our
findings help to better understand code reuse as a phenomenon and the role of
hackathons in this context and can serve as a starting point for further
studies in this area.

crucial to prevent relapses with an appropriate treatment. During
ureteroscopies, kidney stones are fragmented, extracted from the urinary tract,
and their composition is determined using a morpho-constitutional analysis.
This procedure is time consuming (the morpho-constitutional analysis results
are only available after some days) and tedious (the fragment extraction lasts
up to an hour). Identifying the kidney stone type only with the in-vivo
endoscopic images would allow for the dusting of the fragments, while the
morpho-constitutional analysis could be avoided. Only few contributions dealing
with the in vivo identification of kidney stones were published. This paper
discusses and compares five classification methods including deep convolutional
neural networks (DCNN)-based approaches and traditional (non DCNN-based) ones.
Even if the best method is a DCCN approach with a precision and recall of 98%
and 97% over four classes, this contribution shows that a XGBoost classifier
exploiting well-chosen feature vectors can closely approach the performances of
DCNN classifiers for a medical application with a limited number of annotated

particularly useful for neural network training in low-power devices, as in
wireless edge networks. We evaluate the performance and overheads of E$^2$CM
over various base neural networks such as MobileNetV3, EfficientNet, ResNet,
and datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and KMNIST. Our results show that,
given a fixed training time budget, E$^2$CM achieves higher accuracy as
compared to existing early exit mechanisms. Moreover, if there are no
limitations on the training time budget, E$^2$CM can be combined with an
existing early exit scheme to boost the latter's performance, achieving a
better trade-off between computational cost and network accuracy. We also show
that E$^2$CM can be used to decrease the computational cost in unsupervised
learning tasks.

various gate opening of the chute. We find that the effective basal friction
coefficient, muB, obtained from the ratio of the longitudinal force to the
normal one exhibits a systematic increase with increasing slope angle and a
significant weakening with increasing particle hold-up H (the depth-integrated
particle volume fraction). At low angles, the basal friction is slightly less
than or equal to tan(teta). The deviation from tan(teta) can be interpreted as
a contribution from the side-wall to the overall friction. At larger angles,
the basal friction muB saturates at an asymptotic value that is dependent on
the gate opening of the chute. Importantly, our data confirm the outcomes of
recent discrete numerical simulations. First, for steady and fully developed
flows as well as for moderately accelerated ones, the variation of the basal
friction can be captured through a unique dimensionless number, the Froude
number Fr, defined as Fr=U/(gHcos(teta))^1/2, where U is the mean flow
velocity. Second, the mean velocity scales with the particle hold-up H with a

particularly effective in constructing determinantal expansions for quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations with Jastrow-Slater wave functions: fast and
smooth convergence of ground-state properties, as well as balanced descriptions
of ground- and excited-states of different symmetries have been reported. In
particular, accurate excitation energies have been obtained by the pivotal
requirement of using CIPSI expansions with similar second-order perturbation
corrections for each state, that is, similar estimated errors with respect to
the full configuration interaction limit. Here we elaborate on the CIPSI
selection criterion for excited states of the same symmetry as the ground
state, generating expansions from a common orbital set. Using these expansions
in QMC as determinantal components of Jastrow-Slater wave functions, we compute
the lowest, bright excited state of thiophene, which is challenging due to its
significant multireference character. The resulting vertical excitation
energies are within 0.05~eV of the best theoretical estimates, already with
expansions of only a few thousand determinants. Furthermore, we relax the
ground- and excited-state structures following the corresponding root in
variational Monte Carlo and obtain bond lengths which are accurate to better
than 0.01~\AA. Therefore, while the full treatment at the CIPSI level of this

assimilation procedure to forecast the behavior of dynamical systems described
by differential equations. It combines sequential Bayesian update with the MD,
such that the former utilizes available observations while the latter
propagates the (joint) probability distribution of the uncertain system
state(s). The core of DA-MD is the minimization of a distance between an
observation and a prediction in distributional terms, with prior and posterior
distributions constrained on a statistical manifold defined by the MD. We
leverage the information-geometric properties of the statistical manifold to
reduce predictive uncertainty via data assimilation. Specifically, we exploit
the information geometric structures induced by two discrepancy metrics, the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Wasserstein distance, which explicitly
yield natural gradient descent. To further accelerate optimization, we build a
deep neural network as a surrogate model for the MD that enables automatic
differentiation. The manifold's geometry is quantified without sampling,
yielding an accurate approximation of the gradient descent direction. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate that accounting for the information-geometry
of the manifold significantly reduces the computational cost of data
assimilation by facilitating the calculation of gradients and by reducing the
number of required iterations. Both storage needs and computational cost depend
on the dimensionality of a statistical manifold, which is typically small by MD
construction. When convergence is achieved, the Kullback-Leibler and $L_2$
Wasserstein metrics have similar performances, with the former being more
sensitive to poor choices of the prior.

an idealised model of tornadic storms, where the rotating cylinder represents

numerical simulations, analysing the influence of centrifugal buoyancy on the
formation of tornado-like vortices (TLVs). TLVs are self-consistently generated
provided the flow is within the quasi-cyclostrophic (QC) regime. This requires
the Froude number to be greater than the radius-to-height aspect ratio, $Fr
\gtrsim \gamma$. We show that the TLVs share many features with realistic
tornadoes, such as azimuthal velocity profiles, intensification of the vortex
strength, and helicity characteristics. Further, we analyse the influence of
the mechanical bottom boundary conditions on the formation of TLVs, finding
that a rotating fluid column above a stationary surface does not generate TLVs
if centrifugal buoyancy is absent. In contrast, TLVs are generated in the QC
regime with any bottom boundary conditions when centrifugal buoyancy is
present.
  Our simulations bring forth insights into natural supercell thunderstorm
systems by identifying properties that determine whether a mesocyclone becomes
tornadic or remains non-tornadic. Our $Fr \gtrsim \gamma$ predictions
dimensionally imply a critical mesocyclone angular rotation rate of
$\widetilde{\Omega}_{mc} \gtrsim \sqrt{g/H_{mc}}$. Taking a typical mesocyclone
height of $H_{mc}\approx 12$ km, this translates to
$\widetilde{\Omega}_{mc}\gtrsim 3~\times~10^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for centrifugal
buoyancy-dominated, quasi-cyclostrophic tornadogenesis. The formation of the
simulated TLVs happens at all heights on the centrifugal buoyancy time scale
$\tau_{cb}$. This implies a roughly 1 minute, height-invariant formation for
natural tornadoes, consistent with recent observational estimates.

ANAIS' goal is to confirm or refute in a model independent way the DAMA/LIBRA
positive result: an annual modulation in the low-energy detection rate having
all the features expected for the signal induced by dark matter particles in a
standard galactic halo. This modulation, observed for about 20 years, is in
strong tension with the negative results of other very sensitive experiments,
but a model-independent comparison is still lacking. By using the same target
material, NaI(Tl), such comparison is more direct and almost independent on
dark matter particle and halo models. Here, we present the annual modulation
analysis corresponding to three years of ANAIS data (for an effective exposure
of 313.95 kg$\times$y), applying a blind procedure which updates that developed
for the 1.5 years analysis, and later applied to 2 years. The analysis also
improves the background modelling in the fitting of the region of interest
rates. We obtain for the best fit in the [1-6] keV ([2-6] keV) energy region a

temperature-independent, while a decoupling of time scales is observed for
squalane in accordance with literature. An alternative evaluation approach is
made on the squalane data, extracting time scales from the terminal relaxation
mode instead of the peak position, and in this case temperature-independent
coupling is also found for squalane, despite its strong secondary relaxation
contribution. Interestingly, the very same ordering of
response-function-specific time scales is observed for these two liquids, which
is also consistent with the observation made for simple van der Waals bonded
liquids reported previously [Jakobsen \textit{et al.}, J. Chem. Phys.

following response functions, from fast to slow dynamics: shear modulus, bulk
modulus, dielectric permittivity, longitudinal thermal expansivity coefficient,
and longitudinal specific heat. These findings indicate a general relation
between the time scales of different response functions and, as inter-molecuar
interactions apparently play a subordinate role, suggest a rather generic

filter (or filtering process) is the conditional probability of the current
state of some stochastic process (the signal process), given both present and
past values of another process (the observation process). Typically the
filtering process satisfies a dynamical equation, and the question investigated
here concerns the stability of this dynamics. In contrast to previous work,
signal processes given by the iterations of a deterministic mapping $f$ are
considered, with only the initial condition being random. While the stability
of the filter may emerge from strong randomness of the signal processes,
different and more dynamical effects will be exploited in the present work.
More specifically, we consider uniformly hyperbolic $f$ with strong
instabilities providing the necessary mixing. This however requires that the
filtering process is initialised with densities exhibiting already a certain
level of smoothness. Furthermore, $f$ may also have stable directions along
which the filtering process will eventually not have a density, a major
technical difficulty. Further results show that the filtering process is
asymptotically concentrated on the attractor and furthermore will have
densities with respect to the invariant (SRB)~measure along instable manifolds
of $f$.

however, because it is highly ill-conditioned. In the work, we investigate
optimization-based image reconstruction from data acquired over a

optimization program with directional total-variation (TV) constraints applied
to the image, and then develop an iterative algorithm, referred to as the
directional-TV (DTV) algorithm for image reconstruction through solving the
optimization program. We use the DTV algorithm to reconstruct images from data
collected over a variety of limited-angular ranges for breast and bar phantoms
of clinical- and industrial-application relevance. The study demonstrates that
the DTV algorithm accurately recovers the phantoms from data generated over a
significantly reduced angular range, and that it considerably diminishes
artifacts observed otherwise in reconstructions of existing algorithms. We have
also obtained empirical conditions on minimal angular ranges sufficient for
numerically accurate image reconstruction with the DTV algorithm.

settings due to their ability to represent expressive policies. The complex
nature of neural networks, however, makes their output difficult to verify and
predict, which limits their use in safety-critical applications. While
simulations provide insight into the performance of neural network controllers,
they are not enough to guarantee that the controller will perform safely in all
scenarios. To address this problem, recent work has focused on formal methods
to verify properties of neural network outputs. For neural network controllers,
we can use a dynamics model to determine the output properties that must hold
for the controller to operate safely. In this work, we develop a method to use
the results from neural network verification tools to provide probabilistic
safety guarantees on a neural network controller. We develop an adaptive
verification approach to efficiently generate an overapproximation of the
neural network policy. Next, we modify the traditional formulation of Markov
decision process (MDP) model checking to provide guarantees on the
overapproximated policy given a stochastic dynamics model. Finally, we
incorporate techniques in state abstraction to reduce overapproximation error
during the model checking process. We show that our method is able to generate
meaningful probabilistic safety guarantees for aircraft collision avoidance

the parameters after every few iterations, train until either a human observer

accuracy. Simple methods are used to determine if a neural network isn't

determine if a neural network has stopped learning. This stopping criterion
appears to represent a happy medium compared to other popular stopping
criterions, achieving comparable accuracy to the criterions that achieve the
highest final accuracies in 77% or fewer epochs, while the criterions which

learning applications. Distributed gradient descent (GD) is widely employed to
parallelize the learning task by distributing the dataset across multiple
workers. A significant performance bottleneck for the per-iteration completion
time in distributed synchronous GD is $straggling$ workers. Coded distributed
computation techniques have been introduced recently to mitigate stragglers and
to speed up GD iterations by assigning redundant computations to workers. In
this paper, we consider gradient coding (GC), and propose a novel dynamic GC
scheme, which assigns redundant data to workers to acquire the flexibility to
dynamically choose from among a set of possible codes depending on the past
straggling behavior. In particular, we consider GC with clustering, and
regulate the number of stragglers in each cluster by dynamically forming the
clusters at each iteration; hence, the proposed scheme is called $GC$ $with$
$dynamic$ $clustering$ (GC-DC). Under a time-correlated straggling behavior,
GC-DC gains from adapting to the straggling behavior over time such that, at
each iteration, GC-DC aims at distributing the stragglers across clusters as
uniformly as possible based on the past straggler behavior. For both
homogeneous and heterogeneous worker models, we numerically show that GC-DC
provides significant improvements in the average per-iteration completion time
without an increase in the communication load compared to the original GC
scheme.

Unfortunately, this extra space can be prohibitive for memory-limited machines,

  In this paper, we bridge the gap between theory and practice for parallel
in-place (PIP) algorithms. We first define two computational models based on
fork-join parallelism, which reflect modern parallel programming environments.
We then introduce a variety of new parallel in-place algorithms that are simple
and efficient, both in theory and in practice. Our algorithmic highlight is the
Decomposable Property introduced in this paper, which enables existing
non-in-place but highly-optimized parallel algorithms to be converted into
parallel in-place algorithms. Using this property, we obtain algorithms for
random permutation, list contraction, tree contraction, and merging that take
linear work, $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ auxiliary space, and
$O(n^\epsilon\cdot\text{polylog}(n))$ span for $0<\epsilon<1$. We also present
new parallel in-place algorithms for scan, filter, merge, connectivity,
biconnectivity, and minimum spanning forest using other techniques.

usually outperform existing parallel algorithms for the same problems that use
linear auxiliary space, indicating that the theory developed in this paper

spontaneous, non-physical disintegration of a subhalo) remains prevalent in
state-of-the-art dark matter-only cosmological simulations. In order to
quantify the impact of disruption on the inferred subhalo demographics, we
augment the semi-analytical SatGen dynamical subhalo evolution model with an
improved treatment of tidal stripping that is calibrated using the DASH
database of idealized high-resolution simulations of subhalo evolution, which
are free from artificial disruption. We also develop a model of artificial
disruption that reproduces the statistical properties of disruption in the
Bolshoi simulation. Using this framework, we predict subhalo mass functions
(SHMFs), number density profiles, and substructure mass fractions and study how
these quantities are impacted by artificial disruption and mass resolution
limits. We find that artificial disruption affects these quantities at the
$10-20\%$ level, ameliorating previous concerns that it may suppress the SHMF
by as much as a factor of two. We demonstrate that semi-analytical substructure
modeling must include orbit integration in order to properly account for
splashback haloes, which make up roughly half of the subhalo population. We
show that the resolution limit of $N$-body simulations, rather than artificial
disruption, is the primary cause of the radial bias in subhalo number density
found in dark matter-only simulations. Hence, we conclude that the mass
resolution remains the primary limitation of using such simulations to study
subhaloes. Our model provides a fast, flexible, and accurate alternative to
studying substructure statistics in the absence of both numerical resolution
limits and artificial disruption.

mimicking the impact of supernova (SN) feedback on the dark matter (DM)

physically decoupled from the cosmological history of both the DM halo and the
dwarf galaxy, it allows us to study the impact of different macroscopic
parameters such as galaxy concentration, feedback energy and energy injection
time in the process of SN-driven core formation in a physically clear way.
Using our effective model in a suite of N-body simulations of an isolated halo
with different SN feedback parameters, we find that whether or not a DM core
forms is determined by the total amount of SN feedback energy that is
transferred to the DM particles. At a fixed injected energy, the amount of
transferred energy is bigger - and the size of the DM core is larger - the
faster the energy injection occurs and the more compact the dwarf galaxy is.
Analyzing the orbital evolution of kinematic tracers, we demonstrate that a
core forms through SN feedback only if the energy injection is impulsive
relative to the dynamical timescale of particles in the inner halo. However,
there is no fundamental link between the total amount of injected energy and
the injection rate. Consequently, the presence of signatures of impulsive
changes of the gravitational potential is not a sufficient condition for
dwarf-size halos to have cored density profiles.

overabundance of the stars showing Long Period Variables can be observed around
the Tip of the Red Giant Branch, and much more prominently, at the upper part

stable winds and high mass loss are present. The LSP can possibly be a
recurring phenomenon appearing and disappearing in various points of the red

(AB) tilings. Despite the lack of periodicity we prove that each infinite
tiling admits 'perfect matchings' in which every vertex is touched by one
dimer. We introduce an auxiliary 'AB$^*$' tiling obtained from the AB tiling by
deleting all 8-fold coordinated vertices. The AB$^*$ tiling is again
two-dimensional, infinite, and quasiperiodic. The AB$^*$ tiling has a single
connected component, which admits perfect matchings. We find that in all
perfect matchings, dimers on the AB$^*$ tiling lie along disjoint
one-dimensional loops and ladders, separated by 'membranes', sets of edges
where dimers are absent. As a result, the dimer partition function of the
AB$^*$ tiling factorizes into the product of dimer partition functions along
these structures. We compute the partition function and free energy per edge on
the AB$^*$ tiling using an analytic transfer matrix approach. Returning to the
AB tiling, we find that membranes in the AB$^*$ tiling become
'pseudomembranes', sets of edges which collectively host at most one dimer.
This leads to a remarkable discrete scale-invariance in the matching problem.
The structure suggests that the AB tiling should exhibit highly inhomogenous
and slowly decaying connected dimer correlations. Using Monte Carlo
simulations, we find evidence supporting this supposition in the form of
connected dimer correlations consistent with power law behaviour. Within the
set of perfect matchings we find quasiperiodic analogues to the staggered and
columnar phases observed in periodic systems.

protoplanetary discs contain bright rings at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. Dust
trapping induced by pressure maxima in the gas disc is a popular explanation
for these rings. However, it is unclear whether such pressure bumps can survive
for evolutionary time-scales of the disc. In this work, we investigate an
alternative scenario, which involves only dust-gas interactions in a smooth gas
disc. We postulate that ALMA rings are a manifestation of a dense, clumpy
mid-plane that is actively forming planetesimals. The clumpy medium itself
hardly experiences radial drift, but clumps lose mass by disintegration and
vertical transport and planetesimal formation. Starting from a seed ring, we
numerically solve the transport equations to investigate the ring's survival.
In general, rings move outward, due to diffusion of the clump component.
Without pressure support, rings leak material at rates $\sim$40
$M_\oplus\,\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$ and in order for rings to survive, they must feed
from an external mass reservoir of pebbles. In the case where the pebble size
is constant in the disk, a cycle between ring formation and dispersion emerges.
Rings produce large quantities of planetesimals, which could be material for
planet formation and explain the massive budget inferred debris disc. Mock
images of ALMA observations compare well to the rings of Elias 24 and AS 209
from DSHARP's sample.

Each simulation begins with 147 equal-mass embryos around a 0.2 solar mass star
and runs for 100 Myr. We find that planets form rapidly, with most collisions
occurring within the first 1 Myr. The presence of a gas disc reduces the final
number of planets relative to a gas-free environment and causes planets to
migrate inward. We find that roughly a quarter of planetary systems experience
their final giant impact inside the gas disc, suggesting that some super-Earths
may be able to reaccrete an extended gaseous envelope after their final giant
impact, though these may be affected by additional process such as
photoevaporation. In addition, we find that the final distribution of planets

As a result, a concrete geometric understanding of optical responses has so far
been limited to two-level systems, where the Hilbert space is completely

a general theory of Riemannian geometry for resonant optical processes by
identifying transition dipole moment matrix elements as tangent vectors. This
theory applies to arbitrarily high-order responses, suggesting that optical

perpetual current along the sample edge. However, despite the availability of
several candidate materials, such a current has not been observed in
experiments. In this article, we suggest an alternative probe in the form of
impurity-induced chiral currents. We first demonstrate that a single
non-magnetic impurity induces an encircling chiral current. Its direction
depends on the chirality of the order parameter and the sign of the impurity
potential. Building on this observation, we consider the case of multiple
impurities, e.g., realized as adatoms deposited on the surface of a candidate
chiral superconductor. We contrast the response that is obtained in two cases:
(a) when the impurities are all identical in sign and (b) when the impurities
have mixed positive and negative signs. The former leads to coherent currents
within the sample, arising from the fusion of individual current loops. The
latter produces loops of random chirality that lead to incoherent local
currents. These two scenarios can be distinguished by measuring the induced
magnetic field using recent probes such as diamond NV centres. We argue that
impurity-induced currents may be easier to observe than edge currents, as they
can be tuned by varying impurity strength and concentration. We demonstrate
these results using a toy model for $p_x \pm i p_y$ superconductivity on a
square lattice. We develop an improved scheme for Bogoliubov deGennes (BdG)
simulations where both the order parameter as well as the magnetic field are
determined self-consistently.

We separate these $M_{\star} = 10^{10.9} M_\odot$ - $10^{12} M_\odot$ galaxies

overall signal-to-noise ratio of $9.8\sigma$, which overwhelms the tSZ at
150GHz more than in other lower-redshift studies. We correct for the $0.16$ dex
uncertainty in the stellar mass measurements by parameter fitting for an
unconvolved power-law energy-mass relation, $E_{\rm therm} = E_{\rm therm,peak}

traces the gravitational potential in relaxed elliptical galaxies. In this work
we identify a sample of 11 relaxed, isolated elliptical galaxies and measure
the ellipticity of the gravitating matter using X-ray images from the

degree of self-interaction at the scale of $\sigma/m \sim 1$ cm$^2$/g, yet they
also remain compatible with a cold dark matter scenario. We additionally
demonstrate how our results can be used to directly constrain specific dark

the geometric correspondence between the high-frequency quasinormal modes and
the photon geodesics around the black hole, and the breaking of the

intensive individual mobility may jeopardize the survival of the population,

the negative consequence of intensive movement and keeps the system alive. When

address the challenges. Intuitively, we can first estimate multiple
over-exposure images w.r.t. the input image to let the shadow regions in these
images have the same color with shadow-free areas in the input image. Then, we
fuse the original input with the over-exposure images to generate the final
shadow-free counterpart. Nevertheless, the spatial-variant property of the
shadow requires the fusion to be sufficiently `smart', that is, it should
automatically select proper over-exposure pixels from different images to make
the final output natural. To address this challenge, we propose the
shadow-aware FusionNet that takes the shadow image as input to generate fusion
weight maps across all the over-exposure images. Moreover, we propose the
boundary-aware RefineNet to eliminate the remaining shadow trace further. We
conduct extensive experiments on the ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD datasets to validate

a Kerr black hole have focused only on achieving higher numerical accuracy with
limited emphasis on providing their physical interpretation. In this article,
we partially address this issue by computing the quasinormal mode frequency
spectrum of a Kerr black hole using the theory of Regge poles. By considering
the retarded Green's function of the Teukolsky equation, we establish for
scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations an equation linking the
Regge poles to the quasinormal frequencies and we solve it in the
high-frequency regime to get ""semiclassical"" relations permitting us to obtain
the complex frequencies of the weakly damped quasinormal modes from the Regge
trajectories. Numerical results concerning gravitational perturbations ($s=-2$)
are displayed. They are in excellent agreement with the ""exact"" ones in the
eikonal regime $(\ell \gg 1)$ and in very good agreement even for lower values
of $\ell$. Moreover, the splitting of each Regge pole of the Schwarzschild
black hole into an infinite number of Kerr Regge poles explains the breaking of
the azimuthal degeneracy of the quasinormal frequencies of the Schwarzschild
black hole due to rotation. Our work is a first step to extend to Kerr black
holes the approach developed for static spherically symmetric black holes which
allowed, from a geometrical interpretation of the Regge poles in terms of the
properties of the unstable circular null geodesics lying on the photon sphere,
to derive accurate analytical formulas for the Regge trajectories and, as a
by-product, for the complex frequencies of the weakly damped quasinormal modes.

approach to enhance skinning-based animations of 3D characters with vivid
secondary motion effects. We design a neural network that encodes each local
patch of a character simulation mesh where the edges implicitly encode the
internal forces between the neighboring vertices. The network emulates the
ordinary differential equations of the character dynamics, predicting new
vertex positions from the current accelerations, velocities and positions.
Being a local method, our network is independent of the mesh topology and
generalizes to arbitrarily shaped 3D character meshes at test time. We further
represent per-vertex constraints and material properties such as stiffness,
enabling us to easily adjust the dynamics in different parts of the mesh. We
evaluate our method on various character meshes and complex motion sequences.
Our method can be over 30 times more efficient than ground-truth physically
based simulation, and outperforms alternative solutions that provide fast
approximations.

  Wireless SDN Networks",,,,,"cs.CR eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Software-defined networking (SDN) was devised to simplify network management
and automate infrastructure sharing in wired networks. These benefits motivated
the application of SDN in wireless sensor networks to leverage solutions for
complex applications. However, some of the core SDN traits turn the networks
prone to denial of service attacks (DoS). There are proposals in the literature
to detect DoS in wireless SDN networks, however, not without shortcomings:
there is little focus on resource constraints, high detection rates have been
reported only for small networks, and the detection is disengaged from the
identification of the type of the attack or the attacker. Our work targets
these shortcomings by introducing a lightweight, online change point detector
to monitor performance metrics that are impacted when the network is under
attack. A key novelty is that the proposed detector is able to operate in
either centralized or distributed mode. The centralized detector has very high
detection rates and can further distinguish the type of the attack (from a list
of known attacks). On the other hand, the distributed detector provides
information that allows to identify the nodes launching the attack. Our
proposal is tested over IEEE 802.15.4 networks. The results show detection
rates exceeding $96\%$ in networks of 36 and 100 nodes and identification of
the type of the attack with a probability exceeding $0.89$ when using the
centralized approach. Additionally, for some types of attack it was possible to
pinpoint the attackers with an identification probability over $0.93$ when
using distributed detectors.

delay and sum (DAS) beamforming, where the signals received at the transducer
array are sampled before an appropriate delay is applied. This necessitates
sampling rates exceeding the Nyquist rate and the use of a large number of
antenna elements to ensure sufficient image quality. Recently we proposed
methods to reduce the sampling rate and the array size relying on image
recovery using iterative algorithms, based on compressed sensing (CS) and the
finite rate of innovation (FRI) frameworks. Iterative algorithms typically
require a large number of iterations, making them difficult to use in
real-time. Here, we propose a reconstruction method from sub-Nyquist samples in
the time and spatial domain, that is based on unfolding the ISTA algorithm,
resulting in an efficient and interpretable deep network. The inputs to our
network are the subsampled beamformed signals after summation and delay in the
frequency domain, requiring only a subset of the US signal to be stored for
recovery. Our method allows reducing the number of array elements, sampling
rate, and computational time while ensuring high quality imaging performance.
Using \emph{in vivo} data we demonstrate that the proposed method yields
high-quality images while reducing the data volume traditionally used up to 36
times. In terms of image resolution and contrast, our technique outperforms
previously suggested methods as well as DAS and minimum-variance (MV)
beamforming, paving the way to real-time applicable recovery methods.

optimization focus on the Euclidean (i.e., $\ell_2$) setting, where the loss is

algorithm with nearly optimal excess risk. Our result for the $\ell_1$-setup
also extends to general polyhedral norms and feasible sets. Moreover, we show
that the excess risk bounds resulting from our algorithms for $1\leq p \leq 2$

existing linear-time constructions for the Euclidean setup attain a nearly
optimal excess risk in the low-dimensional regime. As a consequence, we show
that such constructions attain a nearly optimal excess risk for $p=\infty$. Our
work draws upon concepts from the geometry of normed spaces, such as the

clustering result, different cluster validation procedures have been proposed
in the literature. While there is extensive work on classical validation
techniques, such as internal and external validation, less attention has been
given to validating and replicating a clustering result using a validation
dataset. Such a dataset may be part of the original dataset, which is separated
before analysis begins, or it could be an independently collected dataset. We
present a systematic structured framework for validating clustering results on
validation data that includes most existing validation approaches. In
particular, we review classical validation techniques such as internal and
external validation, stability analysis, hypothesis testing, and visual
validation, and show how they can be interpreted in terms of our framework. We
precisely define and formalise different types of validation of clustering
results on a validation dataset and explain how each type can be implemented in
practice. Furthermore, we give examples of how clustering studies from the
applied literature that used a validation dataset can be classified into the
framework.

network management solutions for automotive and industrial automation
environments. However, configuring real-time Ethernet networks while
maintaining the desired QoS is challenging due to the dynamic nature of OT
networks and the high configuration parameters. This paper introduces an
SDN-based self-configuration framework for the fully automated configuration of
TSN networks. Unlike standard TSN configuration, we remove end-host-related
dependencies and put flows initially on default paths to extract traffic
characteristics by monitoring network traffic at edge switches. Communicated to
a central SDN controller, these characteristics allow to move the flows to
optimal paths while maintaining hard real-time guarantees, for which we also
formulate an optimization problem. Our simulation results indicate that the
proposed self-configuration approach works properly for different network sizes
and numbers of end-hosts. Even though it slightly increases the average latency
of critical frames, it still provides a certain level of real-time guarantee
without any prior knowledge of flows.

The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC at a

supersymmetric models for various production and decay modes. Exclusion limits
as high as 1310 GeV are established at the 95% confidence level on the mass of
the top squark for direct top squark production models, and as high as 2260 GeV

approximately sample from the posterior distribution. We construct a neural
sampler that is trained with the functional gradient of the KL-divergence
between the empirical sampling distribution and the target distribution,
assuming the gradient resides within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our
generative ParVI (GPVI) approach maintains the asymptotic performance of ParVI
methods while offering the flexibility of a generative sampler. Through
carefully constructed experiments, we show that GPVI outperforms previous
generative ParVI methods such as amortized SVGD, and is competitive with ParVI
as well as gold-standard approaches like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for fitting
both exactly known and intractable target distributions.

cm$^{-3}$ is the lowest recorded from an FRB to date, yet is significantly
higher than the maximum expected from the Milky Way interstellar medium in this
direction (~ 50 pc cm$^{-3}$). We have detected three bursts and one candidate
burst from the source over the period 2020 January-November. The baseband
voltage data for the event on 2020 January 20 enabled a sky localization of the
source to within $\simeq$ 14 sq. arcmin (90% confidence). The FRB localization
is close to M81, a spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. The FRB appears on
the outskirts of M81 (projected offset $\sim$ 20 kpc) but well inside its
extended HI and thick disks. We empirically estimate the probability of chance
coincidence with M81 to be $< 10^{-2}$. However, we cannot reject a Milky Way
halo origin for the FRB. Within the FRB localization region, we find several
interesting cataloged M81 sources and a radio point source detected in the Very

which benefits from different abstractions of temporal resolution to learn
better video representations for long-term motion. Traditional Video models
process inputs at one (or few) fixed temporal resolution without any dynamic
frame selection. However, we argue that, processing multiple temporal
resolutions of the input and doing so dynamically by learning to estimate the
importance of each frame can largely improve video representations, specially
in the domain of temporal activity localization. To this end, we propose (1)
Grid Pool, a learned temporal downsampling layer to extract coarse features,
and, (2) Multi-stage Fusion, a spatio-temporal attention mechanism to fuse a
fine-grained context with the coarse features. We show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-arts for action detection in public datasets
including Charades with a significantly reduced compute and memory footprint.

limited the use of autotuning to libraries for shared-memory and GPU

constructing confidence intervals to describe the performance of individual
kernels (subroutines of benchmarked programs). Once a kernel's performance is
deemed sufficiently predictable for a set of inputs, subsequent invocations are
avoided and replaced with a predictive model of the execution time. We then
leverage online execution path analysis to coordinate selective kernel
execution and propagate each kernel's statistical profile. This strategy is
effective in the presence of frequently-recurring computation and communication
kernels, which is characteristic to algorithms in numerical linear algebra. We
encapsulate this framework as part of a new profiling tool, Critter, that
automates kernel execution decisions and propagates statistical profiles along
critical paths of execution. We evaluate performance prediction accuracy
obtained by our selective execution methods using state-of-the-art
distributed-memory implementations of Cholesky and QR factorization on

accurate assessment of which aspects of a scene are moving and where they are
moving to. A popular approach to 3D motion estimation, termed scene flow, is to
employ 3D point cloud data from consecutive LiDAR scans, although such
approaches have been limited by the small size of real-world, annotated LiDAR
data. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset for scene flow
estimation derived from corresponding tracked 3D objects, which is
$\sim$1,000$\times$ larger than previous real-world datasets in terms of the
number of annotated frames. We demonstrate how previous works were bounded
based on the amount of real LiDAR data available, suggesting that larger
datasets are required to achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance.
Furthermore, we show how previous heuristics for operating on point clouds such
as down-sampling heavily degrade performance, motivating a new class of models
that are tractable on the full point cloud. To address this issue, we introduce
the FastFlow3D architecture which provides real time inference on the full

find a discontinuous thermodynamic phase transition in the composition of the

leads to quasi-discontinuous changes in droplet composition by varying the fuel

clear exponential age effect among different age groups, and, more importantly,
the exponential index is almost invariant across countries and time in the

during the first wave, age is a more significant factor than GDP, while their

sparked renewed interest in providing tight bounds on network tail latency.
Achieving this in practice at reasonable network utilization has proved
elusive, due to a combination of highly bursty application demand, faster link
speeds, and heavy-tailed message sizes. While priority scheduling can be used
to reduce tail latency for some traffic, this comes at a cost of much worse
delay behavior for all other traffic on the network. Most operators choose to
run their networks at very low average utilization, despite the added cost, and
yet still suffer poor tail behavior.
  This paper takes a different approach. We build a system, swp, to help
operators (and network designers) to understand and control tail latency
without relying on priority scheduling. As network workload changes, swp is
designed to give real-time advice on the network switch configurations needed
to maintain tail latency objectives for each traffic class. The core of swp is
an efficient model for simulating the combined effect of traffic
characteristics, end-to-end congestion control, and switch scheduling on
service-level objectives (SLOs), along with an optimizer that adjusts
switch-level scheduling weights assigned to each class. Using simulation across
a diverse set of workloads with different SLOs, we show that to meet the same
SLOs as swp provides, FIFO would require 65% greater link capacity, and 79%
more for scenarios with tight SLOs on bursty traffic classes.

infeasible. Few-shot learning (FSL) is the dominant approach to address this
issue, where the objective is to quickly adapt to novel categories in presence
of a limited number of samples. FSL tasks have been predominantly solved by
leveraging the ideas from gradient-based meta-learning and metric learning
approaches. However, recent works have demonstrated the significance of
powerful feature representations with a simple embedding network that can
outperform existing sophisticated FSL algorithms. In this work, we build on
this insight and propose a novel training mechanism that simultaneously
enforces equivariance and invariance to a general set of geometric
transformations. Equivariance or invariance has been employed standalone in the
previous works; however, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been used
jointly. Simultaneous optimization for both of these contrasting objectives
allows the model to jointly learn features that are not only independent of the
input transformation but also the features that encode the structure of
geometric transformations. These complementary sets of features help generalize
well to novel classes with only a few data samples. We achieve additional
improvements by incorporating a novel self-supervised distillation objective.
Our extensive experimentation shows that even without knowledge distillation
our proposed method can outperform current state-of-the-art FSL methods on five
popular benchmark datasets.

\textit{isolation mass} that is due to a pressure maximum emerging at the outer
edge of the gap opened in gas. This pressure maximum traps the inward drifting
pebbles stopping the accretion of solids onto the core. On the other hand, a
large amount of pebbles ($\sim 100M_\oplus$) should flow through the orbit of
the core until reaching its isolation mass. The efficiency of pebble accretion
increases if the core grows in a dust trap of the protoplanetary disc. Dust
traps are observed as ring-like structures by ALMA suggesting the existence of
global pressure maxima in discs that can also act as planet migration traps.
This work aims to reveal how large a planetary core can grow in such a pressure
maximum by pebble accretion. In our hydrodynamic simulations, pebbles are
treated as a pressureless fluid mutually coupled to the gas via drag force. Our
results show that in a global pressure maximum the pebble isolation mass for a
planetary core is significantly larger than in discs with power-law surface
density profile. An increased isolation mass shortens the formation time of
giant planets.

instability supernova (GRSN) from the 55,500 Msun primordial (Population III)
star. Supermassive stars exceeding 1e4 Msun may exist in the early Universe.
They are generally considered to collapse through the general relativistic
instability to be seed black holes to form supermassive (~ 1e9 Msun) black
holes observed as high-redshift quasars. Some of them, however, may explode as
GRSNe if the explosive helium burning unbinds the supermassive stars following
the collapse triggered by the general relativistic instability. We perform the
radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the GRSN starting shortly before the
shock breakout. We find that the GRSN is characterized by a long-lasting (550
d) luminous (1.5e44 erg/s) plateau phase with the photospheric temperature of
around 5000 K in the rest frame. The plateau phase lasts for decades when it
appears at high redshifts and it will likely be observed as a persistent source
in the future deep near-infrared imaging surveys. Especially, the near-infrared
images reaching 29 AB magnitude that can be obtained by Galaxy and Reionization
EXplorer (G-REX) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to identify
GRSNe up to z ~ 15. Deeper images enable us to discover GRSNe at even higher
redshifts. Having extremely red color, they can be distinguished from other
persistent sources such as high-redshift galaxies by using color information.
We conclude that the deep near-infrared images are able to constrain the
existence of GRSNe from the primordial supermassive stars in the Universe even
without the time domain information.

quality by injecting artificial faults into production code. In recent years,
mutation testing has been extended to machine learning (ML) systems, and deep
learning (DL) in particular; researchers have proposed approaches, tools, and
statistically sound heuristics to determine whether mutants in DL systems are
killed or not. However, as we will argue in this work, questions can be raised
to what extent currently used mutation testing techniques in DL are actually in
line with the classical interpretation of mutation testing. We observe that ML
model development resembles a test-driven development (TDD) process, in which a
training algorithm (`programmer') generates a model (program) that fits the
data points (test data) to labels (implicit assertions), up to a certain
threshold. However, considering proposed mutation testing techniques for ML
systems under this TDD metaphor, in current approaches, the distinction between
production and test code is blurry, and the realism of mutation operators can
be challenged. We also consider the fundamental hypotheses underlying classical
mutation testing: the competent programmer hypothesis and coupling effect
hypothesis. As we will illustrate, these hypotheses do not trivially translate
to ML system development, and more conscious and explicit scoping and concept
mapping will be needed to truly draw parallels. Based on our observations, we
propose several action points for better alignment of mutation testing
techniques for ML with paradigms and vocabularies of classical mutation
testing.

for RL as both the state dimension and available action set changes at every
step, which we solve by proposing new policy architectures with differing

are independent of the mesh size and hence can be deployed on larger
simulations than those used at train time. We demonstrate in comprehensive

competitive with a widely-used error estimator, and generalize to larger, more

(QAP)-based zk-SNARK has been widely used in practice, specially in Blockchain
technology. This is attributed to two desirable features; its fixed-size proof

load of the prover in QAP-based zkSNARKs, is very heavy, even-though it is
designed to be very efficient. This load can be beyond the prover's computation
power to handle, and has to be offloaded to some external servers. In the
existing offloading solutions, either (i) the load of computation, offloaded to
each sever, is a fraction of the prover's primary computation (e.g., DZIK),
however the servers need to be trusted, (ii) the servers are not required to be
trusted, but the computation complexity imposed to each one is the same as the
prover's primary computation (e.g., Trinocchio). In this paper, we present a
scheme, which has the benefits of both solutions. In particular, we propose a
secure multi-party proof generation algorithm where the prover can delegate its
task to $N $ servers, where (i) even if a group of $T \in \mathbb{N}$ servers,
$T\le N$, collude, they cannot gain any information about the secret value $v$,
(ii) the computation complexity of each server is less than $1/(N-T)$ of the

event-by-event correlation between observables. One exciting such observable
$\rho(v^{2}_{n},[p_{T}])$ gauges the correlation between the mean transverse
momentum of particles in an event and the various flow coefficients ($v_n$) in
the same event [1]. Recently it has been proposed that very low multiplicity
events may be sensitive to initial-state glasma correlations [2] rather than
flow-related dynamics. We find utilizing the IP-JAZMA framework that the color
domain explanation for the glasma results are incomplete. We then explore
predictions from PYTHIA-8, and the version for including nuclear collisions
called PYTHIA-ANGANTYR, which have only non-flow correlations and the AMPT
model which has both non-flow and flow-type correlations. We find that
PYTHIA-ANGANTYR has non-flow contributions to $\rho(v^{2}_{n},[p_{T}])$ in p+O,
p+Pb, O+O collisions that are positive at low multiplicity and comparable to
the glasma correlations. It is striking that in PYTHIA-8 in p+p collisions
there is actually a sign-change from positive to negative
$\rho(v^{2}_{n},[p_{T}])$ as a function of multiplicity. The AMPT results match
the experimental data general trends in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, except at
low multiplicity where AMPT has the opposite sign. In p+Pb collisions, AMPT has
the opposite sign from experimental data and we explore this within the context
of parton geometry. Predictions for p+O, O+O, and Xe+Xe are also presented.

protocols, is limited in its ability to quantify uncertainty, incorporate prior
knowledge, guide active learning, and enable continual learning. Bayesian
learning provides a principled approach to address all these limitations, at
the cost of an increase in computational complexity. This paper studies
distributed Bayesian learning in a wireless data center setting encompassing a
central server and multiple distributed workers. Prior work on wireless
distributed learning has focused exclusively on frequentist learning, and has
introduced the idea of leveraging uncoded transmission to enable ""over-the-air""
computing. Unlike frequentist learning, Bayesian learning aims at evaluating
approximations or samples from a global posterior distribution in the model
parameter space. This work investigates for the first time the design of
distributed one-shot, or ""embarrassingly parallel"", Bayesian learning protocols
in wireless data centers via consensus Monte Carlo (CMC). Uncoded transmission
is introduced not only as a way to implement ""over-the-air"" computing, but also
as a mechanism to deploy channel-driven MC sampling: Rather than treating
channel noise as a nuisance to be mitigated, channel-driven sampling utilizes
channel noise as an integral part of the MC sampling process. A simple wireless
CMC scheme is first proposed that is asymptotically optimal under Gaussian
local posteriors. Then, for arbitrary local posteriors, a variational
optimization strategy is introduced. Simulation results demonstrate that, if
properly accounted for, channel noise can indeed contribute to MC sampling and
does not necessarily decrease the accuracy level.

fields as the measured magnetic field depends on the orientation of the sensor
with respect to the field. In addition to the nonlinear Zeeman splitting, the
difference between Zeeman resonances in the two hyperfine ground states can
also generate heading errors depending on initial spin polarization. We examine
heading errors in an all-optical scalar magnetometer that uses free precession
of polarized $^{87}\text{Rb}$ atoms by varying the direction and magnitude of
the magnetic field at different spin polarization regimes. In the high
polarization limit where the lower hyperfine ground state $F = 1$ is almost
depopulated, we show that heading errors can be corrected with an analytical
expression, reducing the errors by two orders of magnitude in Earth's field. We
also verify the linearity of the measured Zeeman precession frequency with the
magnetic field. With lower spin polarization, we find that the splitting of the
Zeeman resonances for the two hyperfine states causes beating in the precession
signals and nonlinearity of the measured precession frequency with the magnetic
field. We correct for the frequency shifts by using the unique probe geometry
where two orthogonal probe beams measure opposite relative phases between the
two hyperfine states during the spin precession.

algorithms' performance using accuracy. Besides, we use the accuracy ratio
between adversarial examples and clean images to measure robustness. Moreover,
we propose a statistical analysis of each classifier's predictions' confidence
to corroborate the results. We confirm that BP predictions' change was below
2\% using adversarial examples computed with the fast gradient sign method.
Also, considering the multiple pixel attack, BP obtained four out of seven
classes without changes and the rest with a maximum error of 4\% in the
predictions. Finally, BP also gets four categories using adversarial patches
without changes and for the remaining three classes with a variation of 1\%.
Additionally, the statistical analysis showed that the predictions' confidence

states, in contrast to traditional Markovian reduced models that rely on the
current reduced state alone to predict the next state. The core contributions

certain conditions, the proposed approach recovers from data the very same
non-Markovian terms that one obtains with intrusive methods that require the
governing equations and discrete operators of the high-dimensional dynamical
system. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to
non-Markovian reduced models that are predictive far beyond the training

learns non-Markovian reduced models from trajectories with only 20% observed

spectral weight transfer from the charge transfer band to the gapped region and
the induced low-energy states emerge in a wide energy range inside the Mott

discussed in chirped spectroscopy, with the only exception of using
Kaiser-Bessel window and trivial rectangular window. We present a specific
window function, called ""Voigt-1D"" window, designed for chirped pulse
spectroscopy. The window function corrects the magnitude Fourier-transform
spectra to Voigt lineshape, and offers wide tunability to control the SnR and
lineshape of the final spectral lines. We derived the mathematical properties
of the window function, and evaluated the performance of the window function in
comparison to the Kaiser-Bessel window on experimental and simulated data sets.
Our result shows that, compared with un-windowed spectra, the Voigt-1D window
is able to produce 100 % SnR enhancement on average.

facility that is recognized worldwide as a leading facility in astronomy,
planetary, and atmospheric and space sciences. AO's cornerstone research
instrument was the 305-m William E. Gordon telescope. On December 1, 2020, the
305-m telescope collapsed and was irreparably damaged. In the three weeks
following the collapse, AO's scientific and engineering staff and the AO users
community initiated extensive discussions on the future of the observatory. The
community is in overwhelming agreement that there is a need to build an
enhanced, next-generation radar-radio telescope at the AO site. From these
discussions, we established the set of science requirements the new facility
should enable. These requirements can be summarized briefly as: 5 MW of
continuous wave transmitter power at 2 - 6 GHz, 10 MW of peak transmitter power
at 430 MHz (also at 220MHz under consideration), zenith angle coverage 0 to 48
deg, frequency coverage 0.2 to 30 GHz and increased Field-of-View. These
requirements determine the unique specifications of the proposed new
instrument. The telescope design concept we suggest consists of a compact array
of fixed dishes on a tiltable, plate-like structure with a collecting area
equivalent to a 300m dish. This concept, referred to as the Next Generation
Arecibo Telescope (NGAT), meets all of the desired specifications and provides
significant new science capabilities to all three research groups at AO. This
whitepaper presents a sample of the wide variety of the science that can be
achieved with the NGAT, the details of the telescope design concept and the
need for the new telescope to be located at the AO site. We also discuss other
AO science activities that interlock with the NGAT in the white paper.

upon modern computational power and classification models from machine
learning. We show that a simple classification algorithm such as a boosted

any single test statistic. This recovery implies an equivalence, under certain
conditions, between the basic building block of modern machine learning and
hypothesis testing. Second, we show that more complex algorithms such as the
random forest and gradient boosted machine can serve as mapping functions in
place of the traditional null distribution. This allows for multiple test
statistics and other information to be evaluated simultaneously and thus form a
pseudo-composite hypothesis test. Moreover, we show how practitioners can make
explicit the relative costs of Type I and Type II errors to contextualize the
test into a specific decision framework. To illustrate this approach we revisit
the case of testing for unit roots, a difficult problem in time series
econometrics for which existing tests are known to exhibit low power. Using a
simulation framework common to the literature we show that this approach can
improve upon overall accuracy of the traditional unit root test(s) by seventeen
percentage points, and the sensitivity by thirty six percentage points.

the number partitioning problem (NPP). The NPP appears in many applications,
including the design of randomized controlled trials, multiprocessor
scheduling, and cryptography; and is also of theoretical significance. It
possesses a so-called statistical-to-computational gap: when its input $X$ has
distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,I_n)$, its optimal value is
$\Theta(\sqrt{n}2^{-n})$ w.h.p.; whereas the best polynomial-time algorithm
achieves an objective value of only $2^{-\Theta(\log^2 n)}$, w.h.p.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of the nature of this gap. Inspired by
insights from statistical physics, we study the landscape of NPP and establish
the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), an intricate geometric property
which is known to be a rigorous evidence of an algorithmic hardness for large
classes of algorithms. By leveraging the OGP, we establish that (a) any
sufficiently stable algorithm, appropriately defined, fails to find a
near-optimal solution with energy below $2^{-\omega(n \log^{-1/5} n)}$; and (b)
a very natural MCMC dynamics fails to find near-optimal solutions. Our
simulations suggest that the state of the art algorithm achieving
$2^{-\Theta(\log^2 n)}$ is indeed stable, but formally verifying this is left
as an open problem.
  OGP regards the overlap structure of $m-$tuples of solutions achieving a
certain objective value. When $m$ is constant we prove the presence of OGP in
the regime $2^{-\Theta(n)}$, and the absence of it in the regime $2^{-o(n)}$.
Interestingly, though, by considering overlaps with growing values of $m$ we
prove the presence of the OGP up to the level $2^{-\omega(\sqrt{n\log n})}$.
Our proof of the failure of stable algorithms at values $2^{-\omega(n
\log^{-1/5} n)}$ employs methods from Ramsey Theory from the extremal
combinatorics, and is of independent interest.

domains, and for an algorithm to work in both, domain-invariant learning is
necessary. Here we employ domain adaptation techniques$-$ Maximum Mean

notoriously difficult processes of marginalization over each network parameter
to estimate its probability density function (PDF). Our hypothesis is that
internal layer outputs of a trained neural network contain all of the
information related to both its mapping function (quantified by its weights) as
well as the input data distribution. We therefore propose a framework for
predictive uncertainty quantification of a trained neural network that
explicitly estimates the PDF of its raw prediction space (before activation),
p(y'|x,w), which we refer to as the model PDF, in a Gaussian reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS). The Gaussian RKHS provides a localized density estimate
of p(y'|x,w), which further enables us to utilize gradient based formulations
of quantum physics to decompose the model PDF in terms of multiple local
uncertainty moments that provide much greater resolution of the PDF than the
central moments characterized by Bayesian methods. This provides the framework
with a better ability to detect distributional shifts in test data away from
the training data PDF learned by the model. We evaluate the framework against
existing uncertainty quantification methods on benchmark datasets that have
been corrupted using common perturbation techniques. The kernel framework is
observed to provide model uncertainty estimates with much greater precision

computation to make it DP, rely on composition theorems to bound the total
privacy loss incurred over this sequence of DP computations.
  However, existing composition theorems present a tension between efficiency
and flexibility. Most theorems require all computations in the sequence to have
a predefined DP parameter, called the privacy budget. This prevents the design
of training algorithms that adapt the privacy budget on the fly, or that
terminate early to reduce the total privacy loss. Alternatively, the few
existing composition results for adaptive privacy budgets provide complex
bounds on the privacy loss, with constants too large to be practical.
  In this paper, we study DP composition under adaptive privacy budgets through
the lens of R\'enyi Differential Privacy, proving a simpler composition theorem
with smaller constants, making it practical enough to use in algorithm design.
We demonstrate two applications of this theorem for DP deep learning: adapting
the noise or batch size online to improve a model's accuracy within a fixed
total privacy loss, and stopping early when fine-tuning a model to reduce total

amounts of data, sometimes on the order of TB/s. Often, a significant fraction
of this data is discarded because current storage systems are unable to keep
pace. To address this, data compression algorithms can be applied to data
arrays containing flow quantities of interest to reduce the overall amount of
storage. Compression methods either exactly reconstruct the original dataset
(lossless compression) or provide an approximate representation of the original
dataset (lossy compression). The matrix column interpolative decomposition (ID)
can be implemented as a type of lossy compression for data matrices that
factors the original data matrix into a product of two smaller factor matrices.
One of these matrices consists of a subset of the columns of the original data
matrix, while the other is a coefficient matrix which approximates the columns
of the original data matrix as linear combinations of the selected columns.
Motivating this work is the observation that the structure of ID algorithms
makes them a natural fit for the asynchronous nature of task-based parallelism;
they are able to operate independently on sub-domains of the system of interest
and, as a result, provide varied levels of compression. Using the task-based
Legion programming model, a single-pass ID algorithm (SPID) for CFD
applications is implemented. Performance studies, scalability, and the accuracy
of the compression algorithms are presented for an analytical Taylor-Green
vortex problem, followed by a large-scale implementation of a compressible
Taylor-Green vortex using a high-order Navier-Stokes solver. In both cases,
compression factors exceeding 100 are achieved with relative errors at or below
10e-3. Moreover, strong and weak scaling results demonstrate that introducing
SPID to solvers leads to negligible increases in runtime.

loop by encircling two threads of DNA, this model includes a remodeling complex

nucleosomes that block SMC translocation along the DNA. Loop extrusion is
enabled by SMC motion along nucleosome-free DNA, created in the wake of the
remodeling complex, while nucleosome re-binding behind the SMC acts as a
ratchet, holding the SMC close to the remodeling complex. We show that, for a
wide range of parameter values, this collection of factors constitutes a
composite LEF that extrudes loops with a velocity, comparable to the velocity
of remodeling complex translocation on chromatin in the absence of SMC, and
much faster than loop extrusion by an isolated SMC that is blocked by

with a mixture of -H and one of -NH$_2$, -COOH, or -OH groups. Then, the
product was dissolved in 0.1M aqueous solution of any of KCl, NaCl, CaCl$_2$,

existed as either a charged or a neutral particle in the solution. Whereas
DND-H with +56 net charges induced the strongest HB$^{(h)}$, the addition of
+28 charges to DND-H led to a drop in HB$^{(h)}$ strength and became identical
to what we observed for HB$^{(h)}$ strength around DND-OH. Considering only
neutral DNDs, HB$^{(h)}$ strength increased in the sequence as DND-H $\approx$
DND-COOH < DND-OH < DND-NH$_2$. For the case of the negatively charged
DND-COOH, while HB$^{(h)}$ in either NaCl or KCl solution was slightly weaker

This technique has widely theoretical and experimental applications in many

basic questions concerning the set of reachable matchings. In their work and

graphs: stars, paths, generalized stars (i.e., trees where at most one vertex
has degree greater than two), trees, and cliques. For generalized stars and
trees, it remains open whether a Pareto-efficient reachable matching can be
found in polynomial time.
  In this paper, we pursue the same set of questions under a natural variant of

objects, and a swap is allowed to take place between two agents if it is
Pareto-improving and the associated objects are adjacent in the network. In
those cases where the question of polynomial-time solvability versus
NP-hardness has been resolved for the social network model, we are able to show
that the same result holds for the network-of-objects model. In addition, for
our model, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a
Pareto-efficient reachable matching in generalized star networks. Moreover, the
object reachability algorithm that we present for path networks is
significantly faster than the known polynomial-time algorithms for the same

We leverage this insight to drop, or remove, ReLUs from classic networks to
significantly reduce inference latency and maintain high accuracy. Given a

the number of ReLUs and accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art for private

about adversarial robustness focus on the loss landscape in the parameter space

studies conclude that the difficulty of adversarial training is caused by the
non-smoothness of the loss function: i.e., its gradient is not Lipschitz
continuous. However, this analysis ignores the dependence of adversarial
attacks on model parameters. Since adversarial attacks are optimized for
models, they should depend on the parameters. Considering this dependence, we
analyze the smoothness of the loss function of adversarial training using the
optimal attacks for the model parameter in more detail. We reveal that the
constraint of adversarial attacks is one cause of the non-smoothness and that
the smoothness depends on the types of the constraints. Specifically, the
$L_\infty$ constraint can cause non-smoothness more than the $L_2$ constraint.
Moreover, our analysis implies that if we flatten the loss function with
respect to input data, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of adversarial
loss tends to increase. To address the non-smoothness, we show that EntropySGD
smoothens the non-smooth loss and improves the performance of adversarial
training.

undertake extensive experiments with various sequence-to-sequence models,
including RNNs, Transformers, and GPT-3 (with the chain of thought prompting).
The results indicate that current models struggle to extrapolate to long-range
syntactic dependency and semantics. Models exhibit a considerable gap toward
human-level generalization when evaluated with new concepts in a few-shot
setting. Moreover, we discover that it is infeasible to solve HINT by merely
scaling up the dataset and the model size; this strategy contributes little to
the extrapolation of syntax and semantics. Finally, in zero-shot GPT-3
experiments, the chain of thought prompting exhibits impressive results and
significantly boosts the test accuracy. We believe the HINT dataset and the
experimental findings are of great interest to the learning community on
systematic generalization.

The metastructures are intended to capture two aspects of their nanoscale

hexagonal lattice sheets. The other is the landscape of weak inter-layer
forces, which is mimicked by the interactions between pairs of magnets located
at corresponding lattice sites on adjacent layers. We illustrate the potential
of this paradigm through a three-layer prototype. The two rigid outer lattices
serve as control layers, while the thin inner layer is free to experience
flexural motion under the confining action of the magnetic forces exchanged
with the outer ones, thus behaving as a lattice on elastic foundation. The
inner layer is free to rotate relatively to the others, giving rise to a rich
spectrum of inter-layer interaction patterns. Our objective is to determine how
the dynamical response can be tuned by changing the twist angle between the
layers. Specifically, we demonstrate experimentally that switching between
different stacking patterns has profound consequences on the phonon landscape,
opening and closing bandgaps in different frequency regimes.

gripper can realize human-like grasp of a range of daily objects. The gripper
can lift objects at least 8 times heavier than its own weight. Furthermore, the
BPActuator is cost effective and each costs about 0.22 USD. Given these

bodies, controlling habitability and influencing geological activity. Under
conditions found in the interior of many planets, as the pressure increases,
the H-bonds in water gradually weaken and are replaced by ionic bonds. Recent
experimental measurements of the water equation of state (EOS) showed both a
new phase of H-bonded water ice, ice-VII$_t$, and a relatively low transition
pressure just above 30 GPa to ionic bonded ice-X, which has a bulk modulus 2.5
times larger. The higher bulk modulus of ice-X produces larger planets for a
given mass, thereby either reducing the atmospheric contribution to the volume
of many exoplanets or limiting their water content. We investigate the impact
of the new EOS measurements on the planetary mass-radius relation and interior
structure for water-rich planets. We find that the change in the planet
mass-radius relation caused by the systematic differences between previous and
new experimental EOS measurements are comparable to the observational
uncertainties in some planet sizes -- an issue that will become more important
as observations continue to improve.

model precedes the control phase, while the aim is to control the system such

is to guarantee safety while learning and control proceed simultaneously.
Specifically, we consider the problem of safe learning in nonlinear
control-affine systems subject to unknown additive uncertainty. We first model
the uncertainty as a Gaussian noise and use state measurements to learn its
mean and covariance. We provide rigorous time-varying bounds on the mean and
covariance of the uncertainty and employ them to modify the control input via
an optimization program with potentially time-varying safety constraints. We
show that with an arbitrarily large probability we can guarantee that the state
will remain in the safe set, while learning and control are carried out
simultaneously, provided that a feasible solution exists for the optimization
problem. We provide a secondary formulation of this optimization that is
computationally more efficient. This is based on tightening the safety
constraints to counter the uncertainty about the learned mean and covariance.
The magnitude of the tightening can be decreased as our confidence in the
learned mean and covariance increases (i.e., as we gather more measurements
about the environment). Extensions of the method are provided for non-Gaussian
process noise with unknown mean and covariance as well as Gaussian
uncertainties with state-dependent mean and covariance to accommodate more

data more efficiently via asynchronous FL, transmission scheduling in the WDLN
for asynchronous FL should be carefully determined considering system
uncertainties, such as time-varying channel and stochastic data arrivals, and
the scarce radio resources in the WDLN. To address this, we propose a metric,
called an effectivity score, which represents the amount of learning from
asynchronous FL. We then formulate an Asynchronous Learning-aware transmission
Scheduling (ALS) problem to maximize the effectivity score and develop three
ALS algorithms, called ALSA-PI, BALSA, and BALSA-PO, to solve it. If the
statistical information about the uncertainties is known, the problem can be
optimally and efficiently solved by ALSA-PI. Even if not, it can be still
optimally solved by BALSA that learns the uncertainties based on a Bayesian
approach using the state information reported from devices. BALSA-PO
suboptimally solves the problem, but it addresses a more restrictive WDLN in
practice, where the AP can observe a limited state information compared with
the information used in BALSA. We show via simulations that the models trained
by our ALS algorithms achieve performances close to that by an ideal benchmark
and outperform those by other state-of-the-art baseline scheduling algorithms
in terms of model accuracy, training loss, learning speed, and robustness of
learning. These results demonstrate that the adaptive scheduling strategy in
our ALS algorithms is effective to asynchronous FL.

height spectrum is important for x-ray and $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy,
charged-particle spectrometry, liquid chromatography, and many other subfields.
However, both the ""centroid"" and ""signal intensity"" of a peak in a pulse-height
spectrum are ill-defined quantities and different methods of analysis will
yield different numerical results. Here, we apply three methods of analysis.
Method A is based on simple count summation and is likely the technique most
frequently applied in practice. The analysis is straightforward and fast, and
does not involve any statistical modeling. We find that it provides reliable
results only for high signal-to-noise data, but has severe limitations in all
other cases. Method B employs a Bayesian model to extract signal counts and
centroid from the measured total and background counts. The resulting values
are derived from the respective posteriors and, therefore, have a rigorous
statistical meaning. The method makes no assumptions about the peak shape. It
yields reliable and relatively small centroid uncertainties. However, it
provides relatively large signal count uncertainties. Method C makes a strong
assumption regarding the peak shape by fitting a Gaussian function to the data.
The fit is based again on a Bayesian model. Although Method C requires careful
consideration of the Gaussian width (usually given by the detector resolution)
used in the fitting, it provides reliable values and relatively small
uncertainties both for the signal counts and the centroid.

signals, the two-dimensional autocorrelation profile map (2D-APM) feature
modelling method, which utilizes epoch folding of the autocorrelation function
of X-ray signals and expands the time-domain information of the periodic axis,
is proposed. A uniform setting criterion regarding the time resolution of the
periodic axis addresses pulsar signals without any prior information. Compared
with the traditional profile, the model has a strong anti-noise ability, a
greater abundance of information and consistent characteristics. The new
feature is simulated with double Gaussian components, and the characteristic
distribution of the model is revealed to be closely related to the distance
between the double peaks of the profile. Next, a deep convolutional neural
network (DCNN) is built, named Inception-ResNet. According to the order of the
peak separation and number of arriving photons, 30 data sets based on the
Poisson process are simulated to construct the training set, and the
observation data of PSRs B0531+21, B0540-69 and B1509-58 from the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer (RXTE) are selected to generate the test set. The number of
training sets and the number of test sets are 30,000 and 5,400, respectively.
After achieving convergence stability, more than 99$\%$ of the pulsar signals
are recognized, and more than 99$\%$ of the interference is successfully
rejected, which verifies the high degree of agreement between the network and
the feature model and the high potential of the proposed method in searching

increase in the rate of heat generation. Permeability and porosity of the gas
diffusion layer do not show a significant impact on the performance in the

templated grain growth occurs during sintering to yield a textured ceramic.
Yet, the final grains are usually micrometric, leading weak mechanical

changing the size of the anisotropic powders and ensuring that magnetic

ZeroSARAH and its distributed variant D-ZeroSARAH are the \emph{first}
variance-reduced algorithms which \emph{do not require any full gradient

any full gradient computations (which are time-consuming steps) is important in
many applications as the number of data samples $n$ usually is very large.
Especially in the distributed setting, periodic computation of full gradient

Attribute-guided Metric Distillation (AMD), to explain existing ReID models.
This is the first method to explore attributes to answer: 1) what and where the
attributes make two persons different, and 2) how much each attribute
contributes to the difference. In AMD, we design a pluggable interpreter
network for target models to generate quantitative contributions of attributes
and visualize accurate attention maps of the most discriminative attributes. To
achieve this goal, we propose a metric distillation loss by which the
interpreter learns to decompose the distance of two persons into components of
attributes with knowledge distilled from the target model. Moreover, we propose
an attribute prior loss to make the interpreter generate attribute-guided
attention maps and to eliminate biases caused by the imbalanced distribution of
attributes. This loss can guide the interpreter to focus on the exclusive and
discriminative attributes rather than the large-area but common attributes of
two persons. Comprehensive experiments show that the interpreter can generate
effective and intuitive explanations for varied models and generalize well
under cross-domain settings. As a by-product, the accuracy of target models can
be further improved with our interpreter.

may cause the social benefit loss and impair the sustainability of the society
in the long term. Regarding this issue, in this work, we will discuss how the
social profit can be improved through strategic demand response (DR)
management. Specifically, we explore two interaction mechanisms in the market:
Nash equilibrium (NE) and Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) among utility companies
(UCs) and user-UC interactions, respectively. At the user side, each user
determines the optimal energy-purchasing strategy to maximize its own profit.
At the UC side, a governmental UC (g-UC) is considered, who aims to optimize
the social profit of the market. Meanwhile, normal UCs play games to maximize
their own profits. As a result, a basic leader-following problem among the UCs
is formulated under the coordination of the independent system operator (ISO).
Moreover, by using our proposed demand function amelioration (DFA) strategy, a
multi-timescale leader-following problem is formulated. In this case, the
maximal market efficiency can be achieved without changing the ""selfish
instinct"" of normal UCs. In addition, by considering the local constraints for
the UCs, two projection-based pricing algorithms are proposed for UCs, which
can provide approximate optimal solutions for the resulting non-convex social

verified by using the concept of price of anarchy (PoA) in a multi-UC

In recent years, advertising platforms are capable of instantly compositing ad
creatives with arbitrarily designated elements of each ingredient, so
advertisers are only required to provide basic materials. While facilitating
the advertisers, a great number of potential ad creatives can be composited,
making it difficult to accurately estimate CTR for them given limited real-time
feedback. To this end, we propose an Adaptive and Efficient ad creative
Selection (AES) framework based on a tree structure. The tree structure on
compositing ingredients enables dynamic programming for efficient ad creative
selection on the basis of CTR. Due to limited feedback, the CTR estimator is
usually of high variance. Exploration techniques based on Thompson sampling are
widely used for reducing variances of the CTR estimator, alleviating feedback
sparsity. Based on the tree structure, Thompson sampling is adapted with
dynamic programming, leading to efficient exploration for potential ad
creatives with the largest CTR. We finally evaluate the proposed algorithm on
the synthetic dataset and the real-world dataset. The results show that our
approach can outperform competing baselines in terms of convergence rate and

state phase diagram as a function of the ratio between the FM and AFM exchange
interactions. Five different phases exist. Three of them are spin polarized
phases; an FM phase and two kinds of ferrimagnetic (FR) phases (referred to as
FR1 and FR2 phases). The spontaneous magnetization per site is $m=1/2$, $1/3$,
and $1/6$ in the FM, FR1, and FR2 phases, respectively. This can be understood
from the fact that an effective spin-1 Heisenberg chain formed by the upper and
lower leg spins has a three-step fractional quantization of the magnetization
per site as $m=1$, $1/2$, and $0$. In particular, an anomalous ""intermediate""
state $m=1/2$ of the effective spin-1 chain with the reduced Hilbert space of a
spin from $3$ to $2$ dimensional is highly unexpected in the context of
conventional spin-1 physics. Thus, surprisingly, the effective spin-1 chain
behaves like a spin-1/2 chain with SU(2) symmetry. The remaining two phases are
spin-singlet phases with translational symmetry breaking in the presence of
valence bond formations. One of them is octamer-siglet phase with a spontaneous
octamerization long-range order of the system, and the other is period-4 phase
characterized by the magnetic superstructure with a period of four structural
unit cells. In these spin-singlet phases, we find the coexistence of valence
bond structure and gapless chain. Although this may be emerged through the
order-by-disorder mechanism, there can be few examples of such a coexistence.

accept as many games offered from its neighbors. Each game signifies a
productive joint economic activity, and players attempt to maximize their
individual utilities. Unsurprisingly, more trustworthy agents are more
desirable as partners. Trustworthiness is measured by the game theoretic
concept of Limited-Trust, which quantifies the maximum cost an agent is willing
to incur in order to improve the net utility of all agents. Agents learn about
their neighbors' trustworthiness through interactions and their behaviors
evolve in response. Empirical trials performed on realistic social networks
show that when given the option, many agents become highly trustworthy; most or
all become highly trustworthy when knowledge of their neighbors'
trustworthiness is based on past interactions rather than known a priori. This
trustworthiness is not the result of altruism, instead agents are intrinsically
motivated to become trustworthy partners by competition. Two insights are
presented: first, trustworthy behavior drives an increase in the utility of all
agents, where maintaining a relatively modest level of trustworthiness may
easily improve net utility by as much as 14.5%. If only one agent exhibits
modest trust among self-centered ones, it can increase its average utility by

High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) structures. Our inverse design approach is based on
pair distribution functions and atomic properties and allows one to train a
model on smaller unit cells and then generate a larger cell. With a speed-up
factor of approximately 1000 with respect to the SQSs, the NESs dramatically
reduces computational costs and time, making possible the generation of very
large structures (over 40,000 atoms) in few hours. Additionally, unlike the
SQSs, the same model can be used to generate multiple structures with the same
fractional composition.

the correspondence between the separated signals and the visual signals to
reflect the speech characteristics during training. Audio-visual speech
separation is a technique to estimate the individual speech signals from a
mixture using the visual signals of the speakers. Conventional studies on
audio-visual speech separation mainly train the separation model on the
audio-only loss, which reflects the distance between the source signals and the
separated signals. However, conventional losses do not reflect the
characteristics of the speech signals, including the speaker's characteristics
and phonetic information, which leads to distortion or remaining noise. To
address this problem, we propose the cross-modal correspondence (CMC) loss,
which is based on the cooccurrence of the speech signal and the visual signal.
Since the visual signal is not affected by background noise and contains
speaker and phonetic information, using the CMC loss enables the audio-visual
speech separation model to remove noise while preserving the speech
characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
learns the cooccurrence on the basis of CMC loss, which improves separation
performance.

extensive simulations and modeling. Computer codes realizing semi-classical and
quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) approaches are often employed to make up for
the lack of accelerator data on many nuclear reactions at intermediate and high
energies (>10s of MeV/n) and are in high demand. This contribution focuses on
the methodology of generating reliable proton-induced cross sections in the
energy range below 1 GeV. We developed a problem-oriented computer framework
based on MCNPX and CASCADE/INPE codes to calculate activation cross section
data at intermediate and high energies. Goodness of the fits of nucleon-nucleus
interaction models to the existing data is evaluated based on elaborated
algorithms. The method is based on the analysis of a large set of data and
calculated cross sections for different targets and residual nuclei in a wide
range of proton energies using numerous criteria. In practice, this could be
done by tuning the model parameters and algorithms to fit required experimental
data subset, or through achieving unification and consistency of fundamental
parameters for all considered reactions. The presented framework is pursuing
the latter approach. We use proton-induced reactions on Si and Fe nuclei to
illustrate the application of the developed multi-criteria algorithm, where we
use all data below 1 GeV available from the EXFOR data library and the IAEA CRP

network, researchers often partition the network into clusters in order to
apply cluster-robust inference methods. Existing such methods require clusters
to be asymptotically independent. Under mild conditions, we prove that, for
this requirement to hold for network-dependent data, it is necessary and
sufficient that clusters have low conductance, the ratio of edge boundary size
to volume. This yields a simple measure of cluster quality. We find in
simulations that when clusters have low conductance, cluster-robust methods
control size better than HAC estimators. However, for important classes of
networks lacking low-conductance clusters, the former can exhibit substantial
size distortion. To determine the number of low-conductance clusters and
construct them, we draw on results in spectral graph theory that connect
conductance to the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Based on these results, we
propose to use the spectrum to determine the number of low-conductance clusters

$n$ nodes drawing $K$ out-edges towards $K$ distinct nodes selected uniformly
at random, and then ignoring the orientation of the arcs. Recently, random
K-out graphs have been used in applications as diverse as random (pairwise) key
predistribution in ad-hoc networks, anonymous message routing in
crypto-currency networks, and differentially-private federated averaging. In
many applications, connectivity of the random K-out graph when some of its
nodes are dishonest, have failed, or have been captured is of practical
interest. We provide a comprehensive set of results on the connectivity and
giant component size of $\mathbb{H}(n;K_n,\gamma_n)$, i.e., random K-out graph
when $\gamma_n$ of its nodes, selected uniformly at random, are deleted. First,
we derive conditions for $K_n$ and $n$ that ensure, with high probability
(whp), the connectivity of the remaining graph when the number of deleted nodes
is $\gamma_n=\Omega(n)$ and $\gamma_n=o(n)$, respectively. Next, we derive
conditions for $\mathbb{H}(n;K_n,\gamma_n)$ to have a giant component, i.e., a
connected subgraph with $\Omega(n)$ nodes, whp. This is also done for different
scalings of $\gamma_n$ and upper bounds are provided for the number of nodes
outside the giant component. Simulation results are presented to validate the
usefulness of the results in the finite node regime.

been a lot of debates on the validity of using sampling to evaluate
recommendation algorithms. Though their work and the recent work (Li et
al.2020) have proposed some basic approaches for mapping the sampling-based
metrics to their global counterparts which rank the entire set of items, there
is still a lack of understanding and consensus on how sampling should be used
for recommendation evaluation. The proposed approaches either are rather
uninformative (linking sampling to metric evaluation) or can only work on
simple metrics, such as Recall/Precision (Krichene and Rendle 2020; Li et al.
2020). In this paper, we introduce a new research problem on learning the
empirical rank distribution, and a new approach based on the estimated rank
distribution, to estimate the top-k metrics. Since this question is closely
related to the underlying mechanism of sampling for recommendation, tackling it
can help better understand the power of sampling and can help resolve the
questions of if and how should we use sampling for evaluating recommendation.
We introduce two approaches based on MLE (MaximalLikelihood Estimation) and its
weighted variants, and ME(Maximal Entropy) principals to recover the empirical
rank distribution, and then utilize them for metrics estimation. The
experimental results show the advantages of using the new approaches for
evaluating recommendation algorithms based on top-k metrics.

processing and machine learning. Most existing works of dictionary learning are
in an offline manner. There are mainly two offline ways for dictionary
learning. One is to do an alternative optimization of both the dictionary and
the sparse code; the other way is to optimize the dictionary by restricting it
over the orthogonal group. The latter one is called orthogonal dictionary
learning which has a lower complexity implementation, hence, it is more
favorable for lowcost devices. However, existing schemes on orthogonal
dictionary learning only work with batch data and can not be implemented
online, which is not applicable for real-time applications. This paper proposes
a novel online orthogonal dictionary scheme to dynamically learn the dictionary
from streaming data without storing the historical data. The proposed scheme
includes a novel problem formulation and an efficient online algorithm design
with convergence analysis. In the problem formulation, we relax the orthogonal
constraint to enable an efficient online algorithm. In the algorithm design, we
propose a new Frank-Wolfe-based online algorithm with a convergence rate of
O(ln t/t^(1/4)). The convergence rate in terms of key system parameters is also
derived. Experiments with synthetic data and real-world sensor readings
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed online orthogonal

keypoint features, our method enables aggregation and matching of deep-learned
local features defined over the feature-space grid. We further introduce a
multi-scale fusion of patch features that have complementary scales (i.e. patch
sizes) via an integral feature space and show that the fused features are
highly invariant to both condition (season, structure, and illumination) and
viewpoint (translation and rotation) changes. Patch-NetVLAD outperforms both
global and local feature descriptor-based methods with comparable compute,
achieving state-of-the-art visual place recognition results on a range of
challenging real-world datasets, including winning the Facebook Mapillary
Visual Place Recognition Challenge at ECCV2020. It is also adaptable to user

Patch-NetVLAD is well suited to enhance both stand-alone place recognition

representation of graph-structured data and achieved better task performance
than conventional methods. The foundation of GNNs is the message passing
procedure, which propagates the information in a node to its neighbors. Since
this procedure proceeds one step per layer, the range of the information
propagation among nodes is small in the lower layers, and it expands toward the
higher layers. Therefore, a GNN model has to be deep enough to capture global
structural information in a graph. On the other hand, it is known that deep GNN
models suffer from performance degradation because they lose nodes' local
information, which would be essential for good model performance, through many
message passing steps. In this study, we propose multi-level attention pooling
(MLAP) for graph-level classification tasks, which can adapt to both local and
global structural information in a graph. It has an attention pooling layer for
each message passing step and computes the final graph representation by
unifying the layer-wise graph representations. The MLAP architecture allows
models to utilize the structural information of graphs with multiple levels of
localities because it preserves layer-wise information before losing them due
to oversmoothing. Results of our experiments show that the MLAP architecture
improves the graph classification performance compared to the baseline
architectures. In addition, analyses on the layer-wise graph representations
suggest that aggregating information from multiple levels of localities indeed
has the potential to improve the discriminability of learned graph
representations.

performance and efficiency requirements. A core challenge in designing such
specialized hardware architectures is how to perform mapping space search,
i.e., search for an optimal mapping from algorithm to hardware. Prior work
shows that choosing an inefficient mapping can lead to multiplicative-factor
efficiency overheads. Additionally, the search space is not only large but also
non-convex and non-smooth, precluding advanced search techniques. As a result,
previous works are forced to implement mapping space search using expert
choices or sub-optimal search heuristics.
  This work proposes Mind Mappings, a novel gradient-based search method for
algorithm-accelerator mapping space search. The key idea is to derive a smooth,
differentiable approximation to the otherwise non-smooth, non-convex search
space. With a smooth, differentiable approximation, we can leverage efficient
gradient-based search algorithms to find high-quality mappings. We extensively
compare Mind Mappings to black-box optimization schemes used in prior work.
When tasked to find mappings for two important workloads (CNN and MTTKRP), the
proposed search finds mappings that achieve an average $1.40\times$,
$1.76\times$, and $1.29\times$ (when run for a fixed number of steps) and
$3.16\times$, $4.19\times$, and $2.90\times$ (when run for a fixed amount of
time) better energy-delay product (EDP) relative to Simulated Annealing,
Genetic Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning, respectively. Meanwhile, Mind
Mappings returns mappings with only $5.32\times$ higher EDP than a possibly
unachievable theoretical lower-bound, indicating proximity to the global
optima.

distinguishing tokens according to their causal history. However, this
so-called individual token interpretation is often considered too detailed.
Here we identify a subclass of Petri nets, called structural conflict nets,
where no interplay between conflict and concurrency due to token multiplicity
occurs. For this subclass, we define abstract processes as equivalence classes
of Goltz-Reisig processes. We justify this approach by showing that there is a
largest abstract process if and only if the underlying net is conflict-free

surrounding environment and a second off-resonant probe that scatters from the
resulting volume of thermally modified refractive index. Over the past twenty
years, considerable effort has been extended to apply photothermal methods to
detect, spatially resolve, and perform absorption spectroscopy on single
non-emissive molecules and other absorbers like plasmonic nanoparticles at room
temperature conditions. Companion theoretical models have been developed to
interpret these experimental advances, yet it is not clear how they are related
to each other nor how the effects of lock-in detection modify the theory. For
larger target systems that host their own intrinsic scattering resonances as
well as for background media that do not instantaneously thermalize with the
absorbing target, additional dependencies arise that are yet to be explored
theoretically. The aim of this Perspective is to overview the theory of
photothermal spectroscopy and microscopy and present a unifying theoretical
approach that recovers past models in certain limits while explicitly including
the effects of target scattering resonances, thermal and optical retardation,
and lock-in detection. Focus is made on plasmonic particles to interpret the
photothermal signal, yet all results are applicable equally to individual
molecules or nanoparticle absorbers. Consequently, we expect this review to
provide a useful foundation for the understanding of photothermal measurements
independent of target identity.

model zoo. Then, we propose a novel framework to tackle the problem, namely
\emph{Task-Adaptive Neural Network Search} (TANS). Given a model-zoo that
consists of network pretrained on diverse datasets, we use a novel amortized
meta-learning framework to learn a cross-modal latent space with contrastive

network on it, and minimize the similarity between irrelevant dataset-network

real-world datasets, against existing NAS/AutoML baselines. The results show
that our method instantly retrieves networks that outperform models obtained
with the baselines with significantly fewer training steps to reach the target

we introduce a deep neural-network (DNN) based method for real-time prediction
of the lower-body pose only from the tracking signals of the upper-body joints.
Specifically, our Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent architecture
predicts the lower-body pose and feet contact probability from past sequence of
tracking signals of the head, hands and pelvis. A major feature of our method
is that the input signal is represented with the velocity of tracking signals.
We show that the velocity representation better models the correlation between
the upper-body and lower-body motions and increase the robustness against the
diverse scales and proportions of the user body than position-orientation
representations. In addition, to remove foot-skating and floating artifacts,
our network predicts feet contact state, which is used to post-process the
lower-body pose with inverse kinematics to preserve the contact. Our network is
lightweight so as to run in real-time applications. We show the effectiveness

visual SLAM algorithm is proposed. Visual SLAM predominantly uses point
features. However, point features lack robustness in low texture and
illuminance variant environments. Therefore, line features are used to
compensate the weaknesses of point features. In addition, point features are
poor in representing discernable features for the naked eye, meaning mapped
point features cannot be recognized. To overcome the limitations above, line
features were actively employed in previous studies. However, since degeneracy
arises in the process of using line features, this paper attempts to solve this
problem. First, a simple method to identify degenerate lines is presented. In
addition, a novel structural constraint is proposed to avoid the degeneracy
problem. At last, a point and line based monocular SLAM system using a robust
optical-flow based lien tracking method is implemented. The results are
verified using experiments with the EuRoC dataset and compared with other
state-of-the-art algorithms. It is proven that our method yields more accurate

the considered model, the backscatter nodes (BNs) store the data in their
buffers before transmission to the Reader. We investigate three utility
functions, namely, the sum, the proportional and the common throughput. We
design online admission policies, corresponding to each utility function, to
determine how much data can be admitted in the buffers. Moreover, we propose an
online data link control policy for jointly controlling the transmit and
receive beamforming vectors as well as the reflection coefficients of the BNs.
The proposed policies for data admission and data link control jointly optimize
the throughput utility, while stabilizing the buffers. We adopt the
min-drift-plus-penalty (MDPP) method in designing the control policies.
Following the MDPP method, we cast the optimal data link control and the data
admission policies as solutions of two independent optimization problems which
should be solved in each time slot. The optimization problem corresponding to
the data link control is non-convex and does not have a trivial solution. Using
Lagrangian dual and quadratic transforms, we find a closed-form iterative
solution. Finally, we use the results on the achievable rates of finite
blocklength codes to study the system performance in the cases with short
packets. As demonstrated, the proposed policies achieve optimal utility and
stabilize the data buffers in the BNs.

combines the iterative localization approach of~\citet{FeldmanKoTa20} with a

This bound is achieved by a new variance-reduced version of the Frank-Wolfe

  Multi-Task Learning Framework","accepted by CVPR 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To minimize the effects of age variation in face recognition, previous work
either extracts identity-related discriminative features by minimizing the
correlation between identity- and age-related features, called age-invariant
face recognition (AIFR), or removes age variation by transforming the faces of
different age groups into the same age group, called face age synthesis (FAS);
however, the former lacks visual results for model interpretation while the
latter suffers from artifacts compromising downstream recognition. Therefore,
this paper proposes a unified, multi-task framework to jointly handle these two
tasks, termed MTLFace, which can learn age-invariant identity-related
representation while achieving pleasing face synthesis. Specifically, we first
decompose the mixed face feature into two uncorrelated components -- identity-
and age-related feature -- through an attention mechanism, and then decorrelate
these two components using multi-task training and continuous domain adaption.
In contrast to the conventional one-hot encoding that achieves group-level FAS,
we propose a novel identity conditional module to achieve identity-level FAS,
with a weight-sharing strategy to improve the age smoothness of synthesized
faces. In addition, we collect and release a large cross-age face dataset with
age and gender annotations to advance the development of the AIFR and FAS.
Extensive experiments on five benchmark cross-age datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed MTLFace over existing state-of-the-art
methods for AIFR and FAS. We further validate MTLFace on two popular general
face recognition datasets, showing competitive performance for face recognition
in the wild. The source code and dataset are available

dynamical behaviors. Empirically, we tackle this issue by extending the degree
p from discrete to a differentiable domain, such that it is efficiently
learnable from a variety of datasets. Taken together, the new model is expected
to benefit from the long memory effect in a stable manner. We experimentally

assumption that the population under study is divided into a group of subjects
who will experience the event of interest over some finite time horizon and
another group of cured subjects who will never experience the event
irrespective of the duration of follow-up. When using the Bayesian paradigm for
inference in survival models with a cure fraction, it is common practice to
rely on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample from posterior
distributions. Although computationally feasible, the iterative nature of MCMC
often implies long sampling times to explore the target space with chains that
may suffer from slow convergence and poor mixing. An alternative strategy for
fast and flexible sampling-free Bayesian inference in the mixture cure model is
suggested in this paper by combining Laplace approximations and penalized
B-splines. A logistic regression model is assumed for the cure proportion and a
Cox proportional hazards model with a P-spline approximated baseline hazard is
used to specify the conditional survival function of susceptible subjects.
Laplace approximations to the conditional latent vector are based on analytical
formulas for the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood, resulting in a
substantial speed-up in approximating posterior distributions. The statistical
performance and computational efficiency of the proposed Laplacian-P-splines

LPSMC is an appealing alternative to classic MCMC for approximate Bayesian

considered as the intellectual properties (IP) of model owners. To date, most
of the existing protection works focus on verifying the ownership after the DNN
model is stolen, which cannot resist piracy in advance. To this end, we propose
an active DNN IP protection method based on adversarial examples against DNN
piracy, named ActiveGuard. ActiveGuard aims to achieve authorization control
and users' fingerprints management through adversarial examples, and can
provide ownership verification. Specifically, ActiveGuard exploits the
elaborate adversarial examples as users' fingerprints to distinguish authorized
users from unauthorized users. Legitimate users can enter fingerprints into DNN
for identity authentication and authorized usage, while unauthorized users will
obtain poor model performance due to an additional control layer. In addition,
ActiveGuard enables the model owner to embed a watermark into the weights of
DNN. When the DNN is illegally pirated, the model owner can extract the
embedded watermark and perform ownership verification. Experimental results
show that, for authorized users, the test accuracy of LeNet-5 and Wide Residual
Network (WRN) models are 99.15% and 91.46%, respectively, while for
unauthorized users, the test accuracy of the two DNNs are only 8.92% (LeNet-5)
and 10% (WRN), respectively. Besides, each authorized user can pass the
fingerprint authentication with a high success rate (up to 100%). For ownership
verification, the embedded watermark can be successfully extracted, while the
normal performance of the DNN model will not be affected. Further, ActiveGuard
is demonstrated to be robust against fingerprint forgery attack, model
fine-tuning attack and pruning attack.

essential for robotics to interact with the surrounding environment.
Large-scale scenes and critical camera motions are great challenges facing the

representation is a linear function of camera global translations, which allows
for efficient and robust camera motion estimation. As a result, the spatial

for enhancing the reliability of wireless communications, which is capable of
reflecting the desired signals through appropriate phase shifts. However, the
intended signals that impinge upon an RIS are often mixed with interfering
signals, which are usually dynamic and unknown. In particular, the received
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) may be degraded by the signals
reflected from the RISs that originate from non-intended users. To tackle this
issue, we introduce the concept of intelligent spectrum learning (ISL), which
uses an appropriately trained convolutional neural network (CNN) at the RIS
controller to help the RISs infer the interfering signals directly from the
incident signals. By capitalizing on the ISL, a distributed control algorithm
is proposed to maximize the received SINR by dynamically configuring the
active/inactive binary status of the RIS elements. Simulation results validate
the performance improvement offered by deep learning and demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed ISL-aided approach.

SnaTCHer rejects samples with large differences to the transformed prototypes.

concurrent systems. With recent advancements in non-volatile memory technology,
there is an increased focus on the problem of recoverable mutual exclusion
(RME), a special case of ME where processes can fail and recover. However, in
order to ensure that the problem of RME is also of practical interest, and not
just a theoretical one, memory reclamation poses as a major obstacle in several
RME algorithms. Often RME algorithms need to allocate memory dynamically, which
increases the memory footprint of the algorithm over time. These algorithms are
typically not equipped with suitable garbage collection due to concurrency and
failures.
  In this work, we present the first ""general"" recoverable algorithm for memory
reclamation in the context of recoverable mutual exclusion. Our algorithm can
be plugged into any RME algorithm very easily and preserves all correctness
property and most desirable properties of the algorithm. The space overhead of
our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^2 * sizeof(node)\ )$, where $n$ is the total
number of processes in the system. In terms of remote memory references (RMRs),
our algorithm is RMR-optimal, i.e, it has a constant RMR overhead per passage.
Our RMR and space complexities are applicable to both $CC$ and $DSM$ memory
models.

in addition to tuning the weights, we tune the structure of pre-trained models,

targeting at pruning the pre-trained model for improved transfer learning.
Different from traditional pruning pipelines, we prune and fine-tune the
pre-trained model according to the target-aware weight importance, generating
an optimal sub-model tailored for a specific target task. In this way, we
transfer a more suitable sub-structure that can be applied during fine-tuning
to benefit the final performance. Extensive experiments on multiple pre-trained

paradigm with improved privacy. After learning, the resulting federated model
should be further personalized to each different client. While several methods
have been proposed to achieve personalization, they are typically limited to a
single local device, which may incur bias or overfitting since data in a single
device is extremely limited. In this paper, we attempt to realize
personalization beyond a single client. The motivation is that during FL, there
may exist many clients with similar data distribution, and thus the
personalization performance could be significantly boosted if these similar
clients can cooperate with each other. Inspired by this, this paper introduces
a new concept called federated adaptation, targeting at adapting the trained
model in a federated manner to achieve better personalization results. However,
the key challenge for federated adaptation is that we could not outsource any
raw data from the client during adaptation, due to privacy concerns. In this
paper, we propose PFA, a framework to accomplish Privacy-preserving Federated
Adaptation. PFA leverages the sparsity property of neural networks to generate
privacy-preserving representations and uses them to efficiently identify
clients with similar data distributions. Based on the grouping results, PFA
conducts an FL process in a group-wise way on the federated model to accomplish
the adaptation. For evaluation, we manually construct several practical FL
datasets based on public datasets in order to simulate both the class-imbalance
and background-difference conditions. Extensive experiments on these datasets

  Overparameterization",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The goal in label-imbalanced and group-sensitive classification is to
optimize relevant metrics such as balanced error and equal opportunity.
Classical methods, such as weighted cross-entropy, fail when training deep nets
to the terminal phase of training (TPT), that is training beyond zero training
error. This observation has motivated recent flurry of activity in developing
heuristic alternatives following the intuitive mechanism of promoting larger
margin for minorities. In contrast to previous heuristics, we follow a
principled analysis explaining how different loss adjustments affect margins.
First, we prove that for all linear classifiers trained in TPT, it is necessary
to introduce multiplicative, rather than additive, logit adjustments so that
the interclass margins change appropriately. To show this, we discover a
connection of the multiplicative CE modification to the cost-sensitive
support-vector machines. Perhaps counterintuitively, we also find that, at the
start of training, the same multiplicative weights can actually harm the
minority classes. Thus, while additive adjustments are ineffective in the TPT,
we show that they can speed up convergence by countering the initial negative
effect of the multiplicative weights. Motivated by these findings, we formulate
the vector-scaling (VS) loss, that captures existing techniques as special
cases. Moreover, we introduce a natural extension of the VS-loss to
group-sensitive classification, thus treating the two common types of
imbalances (label/group) in a unifying way. Importantly, our experiments on
state-of-the-art datasets are fully consistent with our theoretical insights
and confirm the superior performance of our algorithms. Finally, for imbalanced
Gaussian-mixtures data, we perform a generalization analysis, revealing
tradeoffs between balanced / standard error and equal opportunity.

and in particular the bispectrum ($q=3$) and the trispectrum ($q=4$), play a
prominent role in various statistical signal processing and imaging

However, the dimension of the $q$-th order spectrum is $N^{q-1}$, far exceeding
the dimension of $x$, leading to increased computational load and storage
requirements. In this work, we show that it is unnecessary to store and process

the discrepancy between the images and its neighbors, which is defined by

implicitly give estimation without the need of any other images in the
evaluation process. The proposed IDA can be incorporated into existing FR

objectivity of their internal representations enables deep CNNs to readily
transfer and successfully apply these representations to new classification
tasks. Deep CNNs develop their internal representations through a challenging
process of error backpropagation-based supervised training. In contrast, deep
neural networks of the cerebral cortex develop their even more powerful
internal representations in an unsupervised process, apparently guided at a
local level by contextual information. Implementing such local contextual
guidance principles in a single-layer CNN architecture, we propose an efficient
algorithm for developing broad-purpose representations (i.e., representations
transferable to new tasks without additional training) in shallow CNNs trained
on limited-size datasets. A contextually guided CNN (CG-CNN) is trained on
groups of neighboring image patches picked at random image locations in the
dataset. Such neighboring patches are likely to have a common context and
therefore are treated for the purposes of training as belonging to the same
class. Across multiple iterations of such training on different context-sharing
groups of image patches, CNN features that are optimized in one iteration are
then transferred to the next iteration for further optimization, etc. In this
process, CNN features acquire higher pluripotency, or inferential utility for
any arbitrary classification task, which we quantify as a transfer utility. In
our application to natural images, we find that CG-CNN features show the same,
if not higher, transfer utility and classification accuracy as comparable
transferable features in the first CNN layer of the well-known deep networks.

be approximately universal irrespective of the emitter shape. Using the line
charge model, it is established analytically that smooth generic emitter tips
approximately follow this universal trend when the anode is far away. This is
verified using COMSOL for various emitter shapes including the locally
non-parabolic `hemisphere on a cylindrical post'. It is also found numerically
that the curvature-corrected tunneling potential provides an adequate
approximation when the anode is in close proximity as well as in the presence
of other emitters.

including a trusted master node, $N\in \mathbb{N}$ storage nodes, and $K$
users, where each user has access to the contents of a subset of storage nodes.
Each user has an independent secret message with certain rate, defined as the
size of the message normalized by the size of a storage node. Having access to
the secret messages, the trusted master node places encoded shares in the
storage nodes, such that (i) each user can recover its own message from the
content of the storage nodes that it has access to, (ii) each user cannot gain
any information about the message of any other user. We characterize the
capacity region of the distributed multi-user secret sharing, defined as the
set of all achievable rate tuples, subject to the correctness and privacy
constraints. In the achievable scheme, for each user, the master node forms a
polynomial with the degree equal to the number of its accessible storage nodes
minus one, where the value of this polynomial at certain points are stored as
the encoded shares. The message of that user is embedded in some of the
coefficients of the polynomial. The remaining coefficients are determined such
that the content of each storage node serves as the encoded shares for all

constrain the distribution of dark matter on galaxy scales. The typical dark
matter density profiles adopted in dynamical studies cannot easily be adopted
in lensing studies. Ideally, a mass model should be used that has the global
characteristics of realistic dark matter distributions, and that allows for an
analytical calculation of the magnifications and deflection angles. A simple
model with these properties, the broken-power-law (BPL) model, has very
recently been introduced. We examine the dynamical structure of the family of
BPL models. We derive simple closed expressions for basic dynamical properties,
and study the distribution function under the assumption of velocity isotropy.
We find that none of the BPL models with realistic parameters has an isotropic
distribution function that is positive over the entire phase space, implying
that the BPL models cannot be supported by an isotropic velocity distribution,
or models with a more radially anisotropic orbital structure. This result
limits the attractiveness of the BPL family as a tool for lensing studies to
some degree. More generally, we find that not all members of the general family
of double power-law or Zhao models, often used to model dark matter haloes, can
be supported by an isotropic or radially anisotropic distribution function. In
other words, the distribution function may become negative even for spherically
symmetric models with a well-behaved density profile.

A resolution of ordinal convex geometries is again ordinal, but a resolution of
affine convex geometries may fail to be affine. A notion of primitivity, which
generalize the corresponding notion for posets, arises from resolutions: a

for many medical image applications such as heart ROIs detection in perfusion
MRI images, lung boundary detection in chest X-rays, and femoral head detection
in pelvic radiographs. Thus, we proposed a practical framework of ROIs
detection in medical images, with a case study for hip detection in
anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs.
  Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study which analyzed hip
joints seen on 7,399 AP pelvic radiographs from three diverse sources,
including 4,290 high resolution radiographs from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
Osteoarthritis, 3,008 low to medium resolution radiographs from Osteoarthritis
Initiative, and 101 heterogeneous radiographs from Google image search engine.
We presented a deep learning-based ROI detection framework utilizing
single-shot multi-box detector (SSD) with ResNet-101 backbone and customized
head structure based on the characteristics of the obtained datasets, whose
ground truths were labeled by non-medical annotators in a simple graphical
interface.
  Results: Our method achieved average intersection over union (IoU)=0.8115,
average confidence=0.9812, and average precision with threshold IoU=0.5
(AP50)=0.9901 in the independent test set, suggesting that the detected hip
regions have appropriately covered main features of the hip joints.
  Conclusion: The proposed approach featured on low-cost labeling, data-driven
model design, and heterogeneous data testing. We have demonstrated the
feasibility of training a robust hip region detector for AP pelvic radiographs.
This practical framework has a promising potential for a wide range of medical
image applications.

focus on a single equation of state (EOS) and two mass ratios, while neglecting
magnetic fields and neutrino radiation. We then apply newly developed
postprocessing and visualization techniques to the results obtained for this
basic setting. The focus lies on understanding the three-dimensional structure
of the remnant, most notably the fluid flow pattern, and its evolution until
collapse. We investigate the evolution of mass and angular momentum
distribution up to collapse, as well as the differential rotation along and
perpendicular to the equatorial plane. For the cases that we studied, the
remnant cannot be adequately modeled as a differentially rotating axisymetric
NS. Further, the dominant aspect leading to collapse is the GW radiation and
not internal redistribution of angular momentum. We relate features of the
gravitational wave signal to the evolution of the merger remnant, and make the
waveforms publicly available. Finally, we find that the three-dimensional
vorticity field inside the disk is dominated by medium-scale perturbances and
not the orbital velocity, with potential consequences for magnetic field

permeation through potassium channels remains unclear, with structural,
functional and computational studies often providing conflicting data and
interpretations. In this review, we will present the proposed mechanisms,
discuss their origins, and will critically assess them against all available
data. General properties shared by all potassium channels are introduced first,
followed by the introduction of two main mechanisms of ion permeation: soft and
direct knock-on. Then, we will discuss critical computational and experimental
studies that shaped the field. We will especially focus on molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations, that provided mechanistic and energetic aspects of K+
permeation, but at the same time created long-standing controversies. Further

gradients, calculated by some worker nodes over the local data sets, with
minimum communication cost, and in the presence of stragglers. In this paper,
for gradient coding with linear encoding, we characterize the optimum
communication cost for heterogeneous distributed systems with \emph{arbitrary}
data placement, with $s \in \mathbb{N}$ stragglers and $a \in \mathbb{N}$
adversarial nodes. In particular, we show that the optimum communication cost,
normalized by the size of the gradient vectors, is equal to $(r-s-2a)^{-1}$,
where $r \in \mathbb{N}$ is the minimum number that a data partition is
replicated. In other words, the communication cost is determined by the data
partition with the minimum replication, irrespective of the structure of the
placement. The proposed achievable scheme also allows us to target the
computation of a polynomial function of the aggregated gradient matrix. It also
allows us to borrow some ideas from approximation computing and propose an
approximate gradient coding scheme for the cases when the repetition in data
placement is smaller than what is needed to meet the restriction imposed on
communication cost or when the number of stragglers appears to be more than the
presumed value in the system design.

driver nodes. While the minimum number of driver nodes needed for control is
fixed in a given network, there are multiple choices for the driver node set. A
quantity used to investigate this multiplicity is the fraction of redundant
nodes in the network, referring to nodes that do not need any external control.
Previous work has discovered a bimodality feature characterized by a
bifurcation diagram: networks with the same statistical property would stay
with equal probability to have a large or small fraction of redundant nodes.
Here we find that this feature is rooted in the symmetry of the directed
network, where both the degree distribution and the degree correlation can play
a role. The in-in and out-out degree correlation will suppress the bifurcation,
as networks with such degree correlations are asymmetric under network
transpose. The out-in and in-out degree correlation do not change the network
symmetry, hence the bimodality feature is preserved. However, the out-in degree
correlation will change the critical average degree needed for the bifurcation.
Hence by fixing the average degree of networks and tuning out-in degree
correlation alone, we can observe a similar bifurcation diagram. We conduct
analytical analyses that adequately explain the emergence of bimodality caused
by out-in degree correlation. We also propose a quantity, taking both degree
distribution and degree correlation into consideration, to predict if a network
would be at the upper or lower branch of the bifurcation. As is well known that
most real networks are not neutral, our results extend our understandings of
the controllability of complex networks.

the influence of 47 attributes on the verification performance of two popular

adequately described the data and the estimated mean CsA CL/F was 32.6 L h-1
(5%). Allometrically scaled body size, haematocrit (HCT) level, CGC haplotype
carrier status, and postoperative time may contribute to CsA PK variability.
The CsA bioavailability in patients receiving a prednisolone dose (PD) of 80 mg
was 20.6% lower than that in patients receiving 20 mg. A significant decrease
(52.6%) in CL/F was observed as the HCT increased from 10.5% to 60.5%. The CL/F
of the non-CGC haplotype carrier was 14.4% lower than that of the CGC haplotype
carrier at 3 months post operation. CsA dose adjustments should be considered
in different postoperative periods. Conclusions By monitoring body size, HCT,
PD, and CGC haplotype, changes in CsA CL/F over time could be predicted. Such
information could be used to optimise CsA therapy.

using CT images in RT chains such as the registration of MR images to a
separate CT, extra dose delivery, and the additional cost of repeated imaging.
However, one remaining challenge is that the signal intensities of MRI are not
related to the attenuation coefficient of the biological tissue. This work
compares the performance of two state-of-the-art deep learning models; a
generative adversarial network (GAN) and a residual network (ResNet) for
synthetic CTs (sCT) generation from MR images. The brain MR and CT images of 86
participants were analyzed. GAN and ResNet models were implemented for the
generation of synthetic CTs from the 3D T1-weighted MR images using a six-fold
cross-validation scheme. The resulting sCTs were compared, considering the CT
images as a reference using standard metrics such as the mean absolute error
(MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity index
(SSIM). Overall, the ResNet model exhibited higher accuracy in relation to the
delineation of brain tissues. The ResNet model estimated the CT values for the
entire head region with an MAE of 114.1 HU compared to MAE=-10.9 HU obtained
from the GAN model. Moreover, both models offered comparable SSIM and PSNR
values, although the ResNet method exhibited a slightly superior performance
over the GAN method. We compared two state-of-the-art deep learning models for
the task of MR-based sCT generation. The ResNet model exhibited superior
results, thus demonstrating its potential to be used for the challenge of
synthetic CT generation in PET/MR AC and MR-only RT planning.

component as a whole, but we found some local velocity fluctuations in the Main
cloud and extra blueshifted components at the outer regions. Comparing the CO
with previously published large-scale H I data, we suggest that an external

this paper, we propose to explicitly establish the geometric correspondences

learning. Specifically, we observe that when a 3D point in the real world is
visible in both views, there is a deterministic mapping between the projected
points in the two-view images given the height information of this 3D point.
Motivated by this, we develop a novel Satellite to Street-view image Projection

projects the satellite images to the street viewpoint. With these projected
satellite images as network input, we next employ a generator to synthesize
realistic street-view panoramas that are geometrically consistent with the

the edges' richness in natural scenes, we have carried out experiments in many

$n$ agents with additive valuations. Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is
arguably the most compelling fairness notion in this context. However, the
existence of EFX allocations has not been settled and is one of the most
important problems in fair division. Towards resolving this problem, many
impressive results show the existence of its relaxations, e.g., the existence
of $0.618$-EFX allocations, and the existence of EFX at most $n-1$ unallocated
goods. The latter result was recently improved for three agents, in which the
two unallocated goods are allocated through an involved procedure. Reducing the
number of unallocated goods for arbitrary number of agents is a systematic way
to settle the big question. In this paper, we develop a new approach, and show
that for every $\varepsilon \in (0,1/2]$, there always exists a
$(1-\varepsilon)$-EFX allocation with sublinear number of unallocated goods and
high Nash welfare.
  For this, we reduce the EFX problem to a novel problem in extremal graph
theory. We introduce the notion of rainbow cycle number $R(\cdot)$. For all $d
\in \mathbb{N}$, $R(d)$ is the largest $k$ such that there exists a $k$-partite
digraph $G =(\cup_{i \in [k]} V_i, E)$, in which
  1) each part has at most $d$ vertices, i.e., $\lvert V_i \rvert \leq d$ for
all $i \in [k]$,
  2) for any two parts $V_i$ and $V_j$, each vertex in $V_i$ has an incoming
edge from some vertex in $V_j$ and vice-versa, and
  3) there exists no cycle in $G$ that contains at most one vertex from each
part.
  We show that any upper bound on $R(d)$ directly translates to a sublinear
bound on the number of unallocated goods. We establish a polynomial upper bound
on $R(d)$, yielding our main result. Furthermore, our approach is constructive,
which also gives a polynomial-time algorithm for finding such an allocation.

identifying potential adversarial attacks on DNN image classifiers, but cannot

interacting bodies and computed the collision parameters from the results of
the runs. Each run was executed for a lower and a higher accuracy parameter.
The main goal is to determine the probability distribution functions of the
collision parameters and their dependence on the expansion factor. A simple
method is devised to improve the determination of the collision parameters from
the simulation data. It was shown that the distribution of the impact parameter
is uniform and independent of the expansion factor. For real collisions the
impact velocity is greater than 1 mutual escape velocity, a finding that can be
explained using the two-body problem. The results casts some doubts on
simulations of the terrestrial planets' final accretion that have assumed
merge. Collision outcome maps were created adopting the fragmentation model of
\cite{Leinhardt2012} to estimate the number of different types of collisions. A
detailed comparison with earlier works indicates that there are similarities as
well as significant differences between the different works. The results
indicate that as the planetary disc matures and the masses of the bodies
differs progressively than the majority of collisions lead to mass growth

used, as reference, ionising emissivities derived from the AMIGA cosmological
evolutionary model. We find that even using the most conservative estimates,
with a Lyman continuum escape fraction of 10\% the two regions we have defined

ionising photon production efficiency, both bubbles would be in the process of
merging into a large reionised bubble, such as those that through percolation

pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). In the explosion, supernova remnants grow
as hot ionized bubbles and enhance the ionization fraction in the early stage
of the reionization history. This enhancement affects the optical depth of the
cosmic microwave background~(CMB) and generates the additional anisotropy of
the CMB polarization on large scales. Therefore, analyzing the Planck
polarization data allows us to examine the Pop III star SNe and the abundance
of their progenitors, massive Pop III stars. In order to model the SN
contribution to reionization, we introduce a new parameter $\zeta$, which
relates to the abundance of the SNe to the collapse fraction of the Universe.
Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method with the latest Planck polarization
data, we obtain the constraint on our model parameter, $\zeta$. Our constraint
tells us that observed CMB polarization is consistent with the abundance of
PISNe predicted from the star formation rate and initial mass function of Pop
III stars in recent cosmological simulations. We also suggest that combining
further observations on the late reionization history such as high redshift
quasi-stellar object~(QSO) observations can provide tighter constraints and

demonstrate significant benefits of using a rasterised top-down image of the
road, with a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for

sparse semantic layers corresponding to small regions of the High-Definition

that are extracted with respect to the agent's current position. By using an

relationships between detected features within images whilst also preventing
loss of spatial data often caused by the pooling operation. We train and

imaging where the prior is a variational autoencoder (VAE). Specifically we
consider the decoupled case where the prior is trained once and can be reused
for many different log-concave degradation models without retraining. Whereas
previous MAP-based approaches to this problem lead to highly non-convex
optimization algorithms, our approach computes the joint (space-latent) MAP
that naturally leads to alternate optimization algorithms and to the use of a
stochastic encoder to accelerate computations. The resulting technique (JPMAP)
performs Joint Posterior Maximization using an Autoencoding Prior. We show
theoretical and experimental evidence that the proposed objective function is
quite close to bi-convex. Indeed it satisfies a weak bi-convexity property
which is sufficient to guarantee that our optimization scheme converges to a
stationary point. We also highlight the importance of correctly training the
VAE using a denoising criterion, in order to ensure that the encoder
generalizes well to out-of-distribution images, without affecting the quality
of the generative model. This simple modification is key to providing
robustness to the whole procedure. Finally we show how our joint MAP
methodology relates to more common MAP approaches, and we propose a
continuation scheme that makes use of our JPMAP algorithm to provide more
robust MAP estimates. Experimental results also show the higher quality of the
solutions obtained by our JPMAP approach with respect to other non-convex MAP
approaches which more often get stuck in spurious local optima.

extensively analyze its influence on text-based image retrieval. Previous
interactive methods tackle the problem by passively receiving users' feedback
to supplement the incomplete query iteratively, which is time-consuming and
requires heavy user effort. Instead, we propose a novel retrieval framework

actively searches for discriminative details missing in the current query, and
users only need to confirm AI's proposal. Specifically, we propose an
object-based interaction to make the interactive retrieval more user-friendly
and present a reinforcement-learning-based policy to search for discriminative
objects. Furthermore, since fully-supervised training is often infeasible due
to the difficulty of obtaining human-machine dialog data, we present a
weakly-supervised training strategy that needs no human-annotated dialogs other
than a text-image dataset. Experiments show that our framework significantly
improves the performance of text-based image retrieval. Code is avaiable at

Frequently, the jet morphology is spatially discontinuous because of the

large-scale jet emission and to explore the mass ejection history. The aim of
this work was to search for large-scale optical Herbig-Haro (HH) objects lying
in a wide field around a sample of IRAS sources, candidates to trace young
stellar objects. Deep, narrow-band images through the H$\alpha$ and [SII]
emission lines, and through an off-line continuum filter, covering a wide
($\sim15'$) field around the IRAS targets were acquired. The images in the
three filters were analyzed to identify shock-excited line emission (i.e., HH)
in contrast to scattered line emission. New images of a sample of fifteen IRAS
sources, obtained in an homogeneous way are presented. HH emission was detected
in six fields, and the astrometry of the knot features is given. The nature of
the extended emission as scattered emission around nine of the IRAS targets is
confirmed. For seven IRAS sources, with unclear optical counterpart, a more
plausible counterpart is proposed. A refined value of the source distance is
reported for seven targets. An update of the main data available for each of

shape correlations in cosmic shear surveys. As intrinsic shape correlations
(IAs) are caused by tidal gravitational fields acting on galaxies as a
collection of massive non-relativistic test particles, they are only sensitive
to the gravitational potential, which forms in conjunction with the curvature
perturbation. In contrast, the cosmic shear signal probes the sum of these two,
i.e. both Bardeen-potentials. Combining these probes therefore constitutes a
test of gravity, derived from a single measurement.
  Focusing on linear scales and alignments of elliptical galaxies, we study the
impact on inference of the braiding $\hat{\alpha}_B$ and the time evolution of
the Planck mass $\hat{\alpha}_M$ by treating IAs as a genuine signal
contributing to the overall ellipticity correlation. We find that for
\textsc{Euclid}, IAs can help to improve constraints on modified gravity of the
Horndeski-class by 10 per cent if the alignment parameter needed for the linear
alignment model is provided by simulations. If, however, the IA needs to be
self calibrated, all of the sensitivity is put into the inference of the
alignment strength $D$ since there is a very strong correlation with the
evolution of the Planck mass. Thus diminishing the benefit of IA for probing
modified gravitational theories. While the present paper shows results mainly
for modified gravity parameters, similar deductions can be drawn for the
investigation of anisotropic stresses, parameterised modifications to the
Poisson-equation, the phenomenology of gravitational slip and to breaking
degeneracies in a standard cosmology.

problem for an online sequence of data. We use theoretical tools from optimal
detection theory to motivate a definition of online privacy based on the
average amount of information per observation of the stochastic system in
consideration. Two cases are considered: the full-information case, where the
eavesdropper measures all but the signals that indicate a change, and the
limited-information case, where the eavesdropper only measures the state of the
Markov process. For both cases, we provide ways to derive privacy upper-bounds
and compute policies that attain a higher privacy level. It turns out that the
problem of computing privacy-aware policies is concave, and we conclude with
some examples and numerical simulations for both cases.

Further, we annotate if the tweet is written in an offensive style. This
enables us to analyze if supporters of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party
communicate differently than supporters of Donald Trump and the Republican
Party. A BERT baseline classifier shows that the detection if somebody is a
supporter of a candidate can be performed with high quality (.89 F1 for Trump

field-ion imaging and field evaporation simulations, we provide the basis for a
critical reflection on the spatial performance of atom probe tomography in the
analysis of pure metals, low alloyed systems and concentrated solid solutions
(i.e. akin to high-entropy alloys). The spatial resolution imposes strong
limitations on the possible interpretation of measured atomic neighbourhoods,
and directional neighbourhood analyses restricted to the depth are expected to
be more robust. We hope this work gets the community to reflect on its

Exact solutions and reductions of various types of such nonlinear partial
functional differential equations are described for the first time. We present
examples of nonlinear pantograph-type PDEs with proportional delay, which admit
traveling-wave and self-similar solutions (note that PDEs with constant delay
do not have self-similar solutions). Additive, multiplicative and functional
separable solutions, as well as some other exact solutions are also obtained.
Special attention is paid to nonlinear pantograph-type PDEs of a rather general
form, which contain one or two arbitrary functions. In total, more than forty
nonlinear pantograph-type reaction-diffusion PDEs with dilated or contracted
arguments, admitting exact solutions, have been considered. Multi-pantograph
nonlinear PDEs are also discussed. The principle of analogy is formulated,
which makes it possible to efficiently construct exact solutions of nonlinear
pantograph-type PDEs. A number of exact solutions of more complex nonlinear
functional differential equations with varying delay, which arbitrarily depends
on time or spatial coordinate, are also described. The presented equations and
their exact solutions can be used to formulate test problems designed to
evaluate the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for
solving the corresponding nonlinear initial-boundary value problems for PDEs
with varying delay.

turns out to approximate inter-annotator disagreements. Further, we find that
confidence is correlated to emotion intensity: perceiving stronger affect in

processes, of paramount importance. Their accurate description is fundamental
to obtain reliable numerical outcomes useful, e.g., for energy management.
Depending on the physical and geometrical properties of the fractures, fluid
flow can behave differently, going from a slow Darcian regime to more
complicated Brinkman or even Forchheimer regimes for high velocity. The main
problem is to determine where in the fractures one regime is more adequate than
others. In order to determine these low-speed and high-speed regions, this work
proposes an adaptive strategy which is based on selecting the appropriate
constitutive law linking velocity and pressure according to a threshold
criterion on the magnitude of the fluid velocity itself. Both theoretical and
numerical aspects are considered and investigated, showing the potentiality of
the proposed approach. From the analytical viewpoint, we show existence of weak
solutions to such model under reasonable hypotheses on the constitutive laws.
To this end, we use a variational approach identifying solutions with
minimizers of an underlying energy functional. From the numerical viewpoint, we
propose a one-dimensional algorithm which tracks the interface between the low-
and high-speed regions. By running numerical experiments using this algorithm,
we illustrate some interesting behaviors of our adaptive model on a single
fracture and small networks of intersecting fractures.

discovered through the interaction of orders - requests to buy or sell at a
particular price - that are posted to the public limit order book (LOB).
Therefore, LOB data is extremely valuable for modelling market dynamics.
However, LOB data is not freely accessible, which poses a challenge to market
participants and researchers wishing to exploit this information. Fortunately,
trades and quotes (TAQ) data - orders arriving at the top of the LOB, and
trades executing in the market - are more readily available. In this paper, we
present the LOB recreation model, a first attempt from a deep learning
perspective to recreate the top five price levels of the LOB for small-tick
stocks using only TAQ data. Volumes of orders sitting deep in the LOB are
predicted by combining outputs from: (1) a history compiler that uses a Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) module to selectively compile prediction relevant quote
history; (2) a market events simulator, which uses an Ordinary Differential
Equation Recurrent Neural Network (ODE-RNN) to simulate the accumulation of net
order arrivals; and (3) a weighting scheme to adaptively combine the
predictions generated by (1) and (2). By the paradigm of transfer learning, the
source model trained on one stock can be fine-tuned to enable application to
other financial assets of the same class with much lower demand on additional
data. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two real world intraday LOB
datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently recreate the LOB
with high accuracy using only TAQ data as input.

Machine Learning Force Field (MLFF) and, as such, the training set selection
determines the applicability of the MLFF model for predictive molecular
simulations. However, most atomistic reference datasets are inhomogeneously
distributed across configurational space (CS), thus choosing the training set
randomly or according to the probability distribution of the data leads to
models whose accuracy is mainly defined by the most common close-to-equilibrium
configurations in the reference data. In this work, we combine unsupervised and
supervised ML methods to bypass the inherent bias of the data for common
configurations, effectively widening the applicability range of MLFF to the
fullest capabilities of the dataset. To achieve this goal, we first cluster the
CS into subregions similar in terms of geometry and energetics. We iteratively
test a given MLFF performance on each subregion and fill the training set of
the model with the representatives of the most inaccurate parts of the CS. The
proposed approach has been applied to a set of small organic molecules and
alanine tetrapeptide, demonstrating an up to two-fold decrease in the root mean
squared errors for force predictions of these molecules. This result holds for
both kernel-based methods (sGDML and GAP/SOAP models) and deep neural networks

both energy and forces, bypassing the compromise to be made when employing
mixed energy/force loss functions.

freeze-in of a Standard Model (SM) gauge singlet fermionic dark matter (DM)
simultaneously, with inflaton field playing a non-trivial role in their yields.
The renormalizable interactions are restricted to the SM fields, two right
handed neutrinos (RHN) and inflaton coupling exclusively to the RHNs, while the
DM couples to both the SM and the RHNs only via operators of dimension $d>4$.
Considering two separate cases of $d=\{5,6\}$, we show that for $d=5$, inflaton
decay into RHNs followed by their subsequent decay into SM particles lead to
both reheating as well as DM production from the SM bath. This requires a
cut-off scale as large as $\Lambda\sim 10^{17}~\rm GeV$ depending on the DM
mass. On the other hand, for $d=6$, DM production happens directly from
scattering of RHNs (for $\Lambda\gtrsim 10^{14}~\rm GeV$) that results in a
very non-trivial evolution of the DM yield. In both these cases, it is possible
to explain the observed baryon asymmetry through successful non-thermal
leptogenesis via the decay of the RHNs, together with the PLANCK observed relic
density of the DM via pure UV freeze-in mechanism. Taking into account both
instantaneous as well as non-instantaneous reheating separately, we constrain
the parameter space of this minimal scenario from relevant phenomenological
requirements including sub-eV scale active neutrino masses and their mixing.

that virtual objects or any kind of optical information can be generated at a

single-layer nonlinear geometric-phase metasurface made of plasmonic
nanostructures for a simultaneous second and third harmonic generation.
Different from previous works, we demonstrate a two-color hologram with
dissimilar types of nanostructures that generate the color information by
different nonlinear optical processes. The amplitude ratio of both harmonic
signals can be adapted depending on the nanostructures' resonance as well as
the power and the wavelength of the incident laser beam. The two-color

with equal amplitudes using a single near-infrared wavelength. Nonlinear

powerful method for data clustering. However, SNMF is mathematically formulated
as a non-convex optimization problem, making it sensitive to the initialization

clustering result from a set of clustering results, we propose self-supervised
SNMF (S$^3$NMF), which is capable of boosting clustering performance
progressively by taking advantage of the sensitivity to initialization
characteristic of SNMF, without relying on any additional information.
Specifically, we first perform SNMF repeatedly with a random nonnegative matrix
for initialization each time, leading to multiple decomposed matrices. Then, we
rank the quality of the resulting matrices with adaptively learned weights,
from which a new similarity matrix that is expected to be more discriminative
is reconstructed for SNMF again. These two steps are iterated until the
stopping criterion/maximum number of iterations is achieved. We mathematically
formulate S$^3$NMF as a constraint optimization problem, and provide an
alternative optimization algorithm to solve it with the theoretical convergence
guaranteed. Extensive experimental results on $10$ commonly used benchmark

images are always not only sub-sampled but also heavily compressed thus often
containing various artefacts. Simple methods for enhancing the resolution of
such images will exacerbate the artefacts, rendering them visually
objectionable. In spite of its high practical values, super-resolving
compressed images is not well studied in the literature. In this paper, we
propose a novel compressed image super resolution (CISR) framework based on
parallel and series integration of artefacts removal and resolution
enhancement. Based on a mathematical inference model for estimating a clean
low-resolution (LR) image and a clean high-resolution (HR) image from a
down-sampled and compressed observation, we have designed a CISR architecture
consisting of two deep neural network modules: the artefacts removal module
(ARM) and the resolution enhancement module (REM). The ARM and the REM work in
parallel with both taking the compressed LR image as their inputs, at the same
time they also work in series with the REM taking the output of the ARM as one
of its inputs and the ARM taking the output of the REM as its other input. A
technique called unfolding is introduced to recursively suppress the
compression artefacts and restore the image resolution. A unique feature of our
CISR system is that it exploits the parallel and series connections between the
ARM and the REM, and recursive optimization to reduce the model's dependency on
specific types of degradation thus making it possible to train a single model
to super-resolve images compressed by different methods to different qualities.

observed variability in the hydrogen line profiles of 12 Vul, attributed to

deep neural network (DNN) accelerators, thanks to its in-memory and in-situ
analog computing abilities for Vector-Matrix Multiplication-and-Accumulations
(VMMs). However, it is challenging for crossbar architecture to exploit the
sparsity in the DNN. It inevitably causes complex and costly control to exploit
fine-grained sparsity due to the limitation of tightly-coupled crossbar
structure. As the countermeasure, we developed a novel ReRAM-based DNN
accelerator, named Sparse-Multiplication-Engine (SME), based on a hardware and
software co-design framework. First, we orchestrate the bit-sparse pattern to
increase the density of bit-sparsity based on existing quantization methods.
Second, we propose a novel weigh mapping mechanism to slice the bits of a
weight across the crossbars and splice the activation results in peripheral
circuits. This mechanism can decouple the tightly-coupled crossbar structure
and cumulate the sparsity in the crossbar. Finally, a superior squeeze-out
scheme empties the crossbars mapped with highly-sparse non-zeros from the
previous two steps. We design the SME architecture and discuss its use for
other quantization methods and different ReRAM cell technologies. Compared with
prior state-of-the-art designs, the SME shrinks the use of crossbars up to 8.7x
and 2.1x using Resent-50 and MobileNet-v2, respectively, with less than 0.3%
accuracy drop on ImageNet.

strengths of formal and distributional approaches to meaning. More
specifically, proposals have been put forward to augment formal semantic
machinery with distributional meaning representations, thereby introducing the
notion of semantic similarity into formal semantics, or to define
distributional systems that aim to incorporate formal notions such as
entailment and compositionality. However, given the fundamentally different
'representational currency' underlying formal and distributional approaches -
models of the world versus linguistic co-occurrence - their unification has
proven extremely difficult. Here, we define a Distributional Formal Semantics
that integrates distributionality into a formal semantic system on the level of
formal models. This approach offers probabilistic, distributed meaning
representations that are also inherently compositional, and that naturally
capture fundamental semantic notions such as quantification and entailment.
Furthermore, we show how the probabilistic nature of these representations
allows for probabilistic inference, and how the information-theoretic notion of
""information"" (measured in terms of Entropy and Surprisal) naturally follows
from it. Finally, we illustrate how meaning representations can be derived
incrementally from linguistic input using a recurrent neural network model, and
how the resultant incremental semantic construction procedure intuitively
captures key semantic phenomena, including negation, presupposition, and
anaphoricity.

fermions have yet to be observed as elementary particles. In 2015, Weyl
fermions were detected as collective electronic excitations in the strong
spin-orbit coupled material tantalum arsenide, TaAs. This discovery was
followed by a flurry of experimental and theoretical explorations of Weyl
phenomena in materials. Weyl materials naturally lend themselves to the
exploration of the topological index associated with Weyl fermions and their
divergent Berry curvature field, as well as the topological bulk-boundary
correspondence giving rise to protected conducting surface states. Here, we
review the broader class of Weyl topological phenomena in materials, starting
with the observation of emergent Weyl fermions in the bulk and of Fermi arc
states on the surface of the TaAs family of crystals by photoemission
spectroscopy. We then discuss some of the exotic optical and magnetic responses
observed in these materials, as well as the progress in developing some of the
related chiral materials. We discuss the conceptual development of high-fold
chiral fermions, which generalize Weyl fermions, and we review the observation
of high-fold chiral fermion phases by taking the rhodium silicide, RhSi, family
of crystals as a prime example. Lastly, we discuss recent advances in Weyl-line
phases in magnetic topological materials. With this Review, we aim to provide
an introduction to the basic concepts underlying Weyl physics in condensed
matter, and to representative materials and their electronic structures and
topology as revealed by spectroscopic studies. We hope this work serves as a
guide for future theoretical and experimental explorations of chiral fermions

has thus far been no objective and quantitative study of its variation to
reflect the intracity population flows and their corresponding relationship
with lockdown policy stringency from the view of remote sensing images with the
high resolution under 1m. Accordingly, we here provide a quantitative
investigation of the transportation density reduction before and after lockdown
was implemented in six epicenter cities (Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, Paris, New York,
and London) around the world during the COVID-19 epidemic, which is
accomplished by extracting vehicles from the multi-temporal high-resolution

vehicle candidate extraction and deep learning identification was specifically
proposed for the images with the resolution of 0.5m. Our results indicate that
transportation densities were reduced by an average of approximately 50% (and
as much as 75.96%) in these six cities following lockdown. The influences on
transportation density reduction rates are also highly correlated with policy
stringency, with an R^2 value exceeding 0.83. Even within a specific city, the
transportation density changes differed and tended to be distributed in
accordance with the city's land-use patterns. Considering that public
transportation was mostly reduced or even forbidden, our results indicate that

has recently been pursued in the color-glass-condensate (CGC) effective theory
combined with non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization, allowing to study
initial state interactions. Quarkonium polarization, potentially measured in
future experiments, would help elucidate the quarkonium production mechanism at
high multiplicities. In this paper, we provide predictions on $J/\psi$
polarization parameters in high multiplicity proton-proton ($pp$) and
proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions within the CGC+NRQCD framework. Theoretical
predictions are given for $J/\psi$ rapidity $2.5< y_{J/\psi}<4$,
charged-particle multiplicity pseudorapidity $|\eta_{ch} | <1$ and energies
$\sqrt{S}=13\mathrm{~TeV}$ for $pp$, $\sqrt{S}=8.16\mathrm{~TeV}$ for $pA$
collisions. Considering two leptonic frame choices (Collins - Soper and
helicity) we find a weak polarization of $J/\psi$ that additionally decreases
with growing event activities. No significant system size dependence between
$pp$ and $pA$ collisions is obtained - this could be a new constraint to
initial state interactions in small collision systems.

construct polynomial solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p^s$ and study the

over $\mathbb Q_p$ are power series at a certain asymptotic zone of the KZ

  In the appendix written jointly with Steven Sperber we consider all

The $p$-adic limit of $\mathcal M_{p^s}$ as $s\to \infty$ gives us a
one-dimensional space of solutions over $\mathbb Q_p$ at every asymptotic zone.
We apply Dwork's theory and show that our germs of solutions over $\mathbb Q_p$
defined at different asymptotic zones analytically continue into a single
global invariant line subbundle of the associated KZ connection. Notice that
the corresponding KZ connection over $\mathbb C$ does not have proper
nontrivial invariant subbundles, and therefore our invariant line subbundle is
a new feature of the KZ equations over $\mathbb Q_p$. We describe the Frobenius
transformations of solutions of the KZ equations for $g =1$ and then recover
the unit roots of the zeta functions of the elliptic curves defined by the
equations $y^2= \beta \,x(x-1)(x-\alpha)$ over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$.
Here $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb F_p^\times, \alpha \ne 1$.

Republican control of State Legislatures and Congressional seats even in some
states with statewide vote majorities for Democrats.
  Despite overall results showing Republican advantages in many states based on
mean results from simulations covering many random scenarios, the simulations
yield a wide range in metrics, suggesting bias can be minimized better by
selecting districting plans with low values for efficiency gap than by
selecting plans with values near the means for the ensemble of random
simulations.

framework, 2) answer why the forgetting happens: the causal effect of the old
data is lost in new training, and then 3) explain how the existing techniques
mitigate it: they bring the causal effect back. Based on the framework, we find
that although the feature/label distillation is storage-efficient, its causal
effect is not coherent with the end-to-end feature learning merit, which is
however preserved by data replay. To this end, we propose to distill the
Colliding Effect between the old and the new data, which is fundamentally
equivalent to the causal effect of data replay, but without any cost of replay
storage. Thanks to the causal effect analysis, we can further capture the
Incremental Momentum Effect of the data stream, removing which can help to
retain the old effect overwhelmed by the new data effect, and thus alleviate
the forgetting of the old class in testing. Extensive experiments on three CIL

estimates for specific UK nations and regions using random effects meta
analyses techniques, utilising the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method
to estimate the heterogeneity variance parameter, and two approaches to
calculate the confidence interval for the combined estimate: the standard
Wald-type intervals; and the Knapp and Hartung (KNHA) method. As estimates in
this setting are derived using model predictions, each with varying degrees of
uncertainty, equal weighting is favoured over the more standard
inverse-variance weighting in order avoid potential up-weighting of models
providing estimates with lower levels of uncertainty that are not fully
accounting for inherent uncertainties. Utilising these meta-analysis techniques
has allowed for statistically robust combined estimates to be calculated for
key COVID-19 outcome measures. This in turn allows timely and informed decision
making based on all of the available information.

  Images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Because of the explosive growth of face photos as well as their widespread
dissemination and easy accessibility in social media, the security and privacy
of personal identity information becomes an unprecedented challenge. Meanwhile,
the convenience brought by advanced identity-agnostic computer vision
technologies is attractive. Therefore, it is important to use face images while
taking careful consideration in protecting people's identities. Given a face
image, face de-identification, also known as face anonymization, refers to
generating another image with similar appearance and the same background, while
the real identity is hidden. Although extensive efforts have been made,
existing face de-identification techniques are either insufficient in
photo-reality or incapable of well-balancing privacy and utility. In this
paper, we focus on tackling these challenges to improve face de-identification.
We propose IdentityDP, a face anonymization framework that combines a
data-driven deep neural network with a differential privacy (DP) mechanism.
This framework encompasses three stages: facial representations
disentanglement, $\epsilon$-IdentityDP perturbation and image reconstruction.
Our model can effectively obfuscate the identity-related information of faces,
preserve significant visual similarity, and generate high-quality images that
can be used for identity-agnostic computer vision tasks, such as detection,
tracking, etc. Different from the previous methods, we can adjust the balance
of privacy and utility through the privacy budget according to pratical demands
and provide a diversity of results without pre-annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our
proposed anonymization framework.

fully consistent with recently published linear and piecewise linear fits to
the semi-empirical initial-final mass relation and provide a crucial, precise
anchor point for the initial-final mass relation for solar-metallicity,
low-mass stars. The mean mass of M67 white dwarfs is also consistent with the
sharp narrow peak in the local field white dwarf mass distribution, indicating
that a majority of recently-formed field white dwarfs come from stars with
progenitor masses of $\approx 1.5 M_{\odot}$. Our results enable more precise
modeling of the Galactic star formation rate encoded in the field WD mass

challenging. Previous studies show the feasibility of leveraging machine
learning to recommend log placement despite the data imbalance since logging is
a fraction of the overall code base. However, it remains unknown how those
techniques apply to an industry setting, and little is known about the effect
of imbalanced data and sampling techniques.
  In this paper, we study the log placement problem in the code base of Adyen,
a large-scale payment company. We analyze 34,526 Java files and 309,527 methods
that sum up +2M SLOC. We systematically measure the effectiveness of five
models based on code metrics, explore the effect of sampling techniques,
understand which features models consider to be relevant for the prediction,
and evaluate whether we can exploit 388,086 methods from 29 Apache projects to
learn where to log in an industry setting.
  Our best performing model achieves 79% of balanced accuracy, 81% of
precision, 60% of recall. While sampling techniques improve recall, they
penalize precision at a prohibitive cost. Experiments with open-source data
yield under-performing models over Adyen's test set; nevertheless, they are
useful due to their low rate of false positives. Our supporting scripts and

nodes in the aggregation process for learning node representations. A class of

importance of neighbor nodes, which we call implicit GNNs such as Graph
Attention Network. The basic idea of implicit GNNs is to introduce graph
information with special properties followed by Learnable Transformation

of graph information disappear during the learning process, resulting in graph

phenomenon Graph Information Vanishing (GIV). Also, we find that LTS maps
different graph information into highly similar results. To validate the above
two points, we design two sets of 70 random experiments on five Implicit GNNs
methods and seven benchmark datasets by using a random permutation operator to
randomly disrupt the order of graph information and replacing graph information
with random values. We find that randomization does not affect the model
performance in 93\% of the cases, with about 7 percentage causing an average
0.5\% accuracy loss. And the cosine similarity of output results, generated by
LTS mapping different graph information, over 99\% with an 81\% proportion. The

spectrum for the discretized scalar field in the ground state indicates a
cross-over in the zero-mode regime, which is further substantiated by an
analytical treatment of both entanglement entropy and logarithmic negativity.
The exact nature of this cross-over depends on the boundary conditions used --
the leading order term switches from a $\log$ to $\log-\log$ behavior for the
Periodic and Neumann boundary conditions. In contrast, for Dirichlet, it is the
parameters within the leading $\log-\log$ term that are switched. We show that
this cross-over manifests as a change in the behavior of the leading order
divergent term for entanglement entropy and logarithmic negativity close to the
zero-mode limit. We thus show that the two regimes have fundamentally different
information content. Furthermore, an analysis of the ground state fidelity
shows us that the region between critical point $\Lambda=0$ and the crossover

the IR cutoff of the system. For the reduced state of a single oscillator, we
show that this cross-over occurs in the region $Nam_f\sim \mathscr{O}(1)$.

necessary properties of both cloud and accelerator. By using available
Supernova Remnant (SNR) and interstellar cloud catalogues, we produce a ranked
shortlist of the most promising target systems, those for which a detectable
gamma-ray flux is predicted, in the case that particles are accelerated to PeV
energies in a nearby SNR. We discuss detection prospects for future facilities
including CTA, LHAASO and SWGO; and compare our predictions with known
gamma-ray sources. The four interstellar clouds with the brightest predicted
fluxes >100 TeV identified by this model are located at (l,b) = (333.46,-0.31),
(16.97,0.53), (110.43,1.89) and (336.73,-0.98). These clouds are consistently
bright under a range of model scenarios, including variation in the diffusion
coefficient and particle spectrum. On average, a detectable gamma-ray flux is
more likely for more massive clouds; systems with lower separation distance
between the SNR and cloud; and for slightly older SNRs.

heterogeneity in brain dynamics and function. However, how such a cell-to-cell
diversity can affect cortical computation, synchronization, and neuronal
communication is still under debate. Previous studies have focused on the
effect of neuronal heterogeneity in one neuronal population. Here we are
specifically interested in the effect of neuronal variability on the phase
relations between two populations, which can be related to different cortical
communication hypotheses. It has been recently shown that two spiking neuron
populations unidirectionally connected in a sender-receiver configuration can
exhibit anticipated synchronization (AS), which is characterized by a negative
phase-lag. This phenomenon has been reported in electrophysiological data of
non-human primates and human EEG during a visual discrimination cognitive task.
In experiments, the unidirectional coupling could be accessed by Granger
causality and can be accompanied by both positive or negative phase difference
between cortical areas. Here we propose a model of two coupled populations in
which the neuronal heterogeneity can determine the dynamical relation between
the sender and the receiver and can reproduce phase relations reported in
experiments. Depending on the distribution of parameters characterizing the
neuronal firing patterns, the system can exhibit both AS and the usual delayed
synchronization regime (DS, with positive phase) as well as a zero-lag
synchronization regime and phase bistability between AS and DS. Furthermore, we
show that our network can present diversity in their phase relations
maintaining the excitation-inhibition balance.

  Vehicles in Occluded Scenarios","This paper is submitted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2021",,,,"eess.SY cs.RO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the main challenges in developing autonomous transport systems based
on connected and automated vehicles is the comprehension and understanding of
the environment around each vehicle. In many situations, the understanding is
limited to the information gathered by the sensors mounted on the ego-vehicle,
and it might be severely affected by occlusion caused by other vehicles or
fixed obstacles along the road. Situational awareness is the ability to
perceive and comprehend a traffic situation and to predict the intent of
vehicles and road users in the surrounding of the ego-vehicle. The main
objective of this paper is to propose a framework for how to automatically
increase the situational awareness for an automatic bus in a realistic scenario
when a pedestrian behind a parked truck might decide to walk across the road.
Depending on the ego-vehicle's ability to fuse information from sensors in
other vehicles or in the infrastructure, shared situational awareness is
developed using a set-based estimation technique that provides robust
guarantees for the location of the pedestrian. A two-level information fusion
architecture is adopted, where sensor measurements are fused locally, and then
the corresponding estimates are shared between vehicles and units in the
infrastructure. Thanks to the provided safety guarantees, it is possible to
appropriately adjust the ego-vehicle speed to maintain a proper safety margin.
It is also argued that the framework is suitable for handling sensor failures
and false detections in a systematic way. Three scenarios of growing
information complexity are considered throughout the study. Simulations show
how the increased situational awareness allows the ego-vehicle to maintain a
reasonable speed without sacrificing safety.

Another striking compositional feature of this comet is its heavy depletion in
H2O, compared to other comets. Here, we investigate the formation circumstances

first envisage the possibility that this comet agglomerated from clathrates,
but we find that such a scenario does not explain the observed low water
abundance. We then alternatively investigate the possibility that the building
blocks of the comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS) agglomerated from grains and pebbles
made of pure condensates via the use of a disk model describing the radial
transport of volatiles. We show that N2/CO ratios reproducing the value
estimated in this comet can be found in grains condensed in the vicinity of the
CO and N2 icelines. Moreover, high CO/H2O ratios (>100 times the initial gas
phase value) can be found in grains condensed in the vicinity of the CO
iceline. If the building blocks of a comet assembled from such grains, they

explicitly display an $8\sigma$ tension between the observed distribution of
this ratio and that in the EAGLE simulation at redshift 0. We also compare the
evolution of Newtonian galactic discs embedded in DM haloes to their evolution
in three extended gravity theories: Milgromian Dynamics (MOND), a model of
non-local gravity, and a scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory (MOG). Although
our models start with the same initial baryonic distribution and rotation
curve, the long-term evolution is different. The bar instability happens more
violently in MOND compared to the other models. There are some common features
between the extended gravity models, in particular the negligible role played
by dynamical friction $-$ which plays a key role in the DM model. Partly for
this reason, all extended gravity models predict weaker bars and faster bar
pattern speeds compared to the DM case. Although the absence of strong bars in
our idealized, isolated extended gravity simulations is in tension with
observations, they reproduce the strong observational preference for `fast' bar
pattern speeds, which we could not do with DM. We confirm previous findings
that apparently `ultrafast' bars can be due to bar-spiral arm alignment leading
to an overestimated bar length, especially in extended gravity scenarios where
the bar is already fast.

potentials, $V\propto \phi^n$ with $n=2/3\,,1\,,\,2$ and $4$, and natural
inflaton potential, and for power-law kinetic term we choose quadratic, quartic

terms of reheating temperature $T_{re}$, number of e-folds during reheating
$N_{re}$ and effective equation of state during reheating $w_{re}$. These
parameters can be related to the spectral index $n_s$ and other inflationary
parameters depending on the choice of inflaton kinetic term and potential. By
demanding that $w_{re}$ should have a finite range and $T_{re}$ should be above

quadratic and quartic potential with power-law kinetic term are also compatible
with Planck-2018 joint constraints on $n_s$ and $r$ for $0\le w_{re} \le 1$.
However, for exponential potential with power-law kinetic term, the equation of
state during reheating $w_{re}$ should be greater than $1$ for $r-n_s$

decision based on subject characteristics, with the policy chosen to maximize
some value. It is common to aim to maximize the mean outcome in the population,
via a regime assigning treatment only to those whose mean outcome is higher
under treatment versus control. However, the mean can be an unstable measure of
centrality, resulting in imprecise statistical procedures, as well as unrobust
decisions that can be overly influenced by a small fraction of subjects. In
this work, we propose a new median optimal treatment regime that instead treats
individuals whose conditional median is higher under treatment. This ensures
that optimal decisions for individuals from the same group are not overly
influenced either by (i) a small fraction of the group (unlike the mean
criterion), or (ii) unrelated subjects from different groups (unlike marginal
median/quantile criteria). We introduce a new measure of value, the Average
Conditional Median Effect (ACME), which summarizes across-group median
treatment outcomes of a policy, and which the median optimal treatment regime
maximizes. After developing key motivating examples that distinguish median
optimal treatment regimes from mean and marginal median optimal treatment
regimes, we give a nonparametric efficiency bound for estimating the ACME of a
policy, and propose a new doubly robust-style estimator that achieves the
efficiency bound under weak conditions. To construct the median optimal

The analysis is carried out using proton-proton collision data corresponding to
a total integrated luminosity of 9 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb experiment
at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV. The most significant state,
$Z_{cs}(4000)^+$, has a mass of $4003\pm6\,^{+\,\phantom{0}4}_{-\,14}$ MeV, a
width of $131\pm15\pm26$ MeV, and spin-parity $J^P=1^+$, where the quoted
uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. A new $1^+$
$X(4685)$ state decaying to the $J/\psi \phi$ final state is also observed with
high significance. In addition, the four previously reported $J/\psi \phi$

inference and prediction in the sphere of oil and gas reservoir development is
considered. This allows analysing parameters of a reservoir, discovery
dependencies among parameters (including cause and effects relations), checking
for anomalies, prediction of expected values of missing parameters, looking for
the closest analogues, and much more. The method is based on extended algorithm
MixLearn@BN for structural learning of Bayesian networks. Key ideas of
MixLearn@BN are following: (1) learning the network structure on homogeneous
data subsets, (2) assigning a part of the structure by an expert, and (3)
learning the distribution parameters on mixed data (discrete and continuous).
Homogeneous data subsets are identified as various groups of reservoirs with
similar features (analogues), where similarity measure may be based on several
types of distances. The aim of the described technique of Bayesian network
learning is to improve the quality of predictions and causal inference on such
networks. Experimental studies prove that the suggested method gives a
significant advantage in missing values prediction and anomalies detection
accuracy. Moreover, the method was applied to the database of more than a
thousand petroleum reservoirs across the globe and allowed to discover novel
insights in geological parameters relationships.

are indispensable components for describing quantum systems and their dynamical
behavior. Recently, the resource theory of imaginarity has been introduced,
allowing for a systematic study of complex numbers in quantum mechanics and
quantum information theory. In this work we develop theoretical methods for the
resource theory of imaginarity, motivated by recent progress within theories of
entanglement and coherence. We investigate imaginarity quantification, focusing
on the geometric imaginarity and the robustness of imaginarity, and apply these
tools to the state conversion problem in imaginarity theory. Moreover, we
analyze the complexity of real and general operations in optical experiments,
focusing on the number of unfixed wave plates for their implementation. We also
discuss the role of imaginarity for local state discrimination, proving that
any pair of real orthogonal pure states can be discriminated via local real
operations and classical communication. Our study reveals the significance of
complex numbers in quantum physics, and proves that imaginarity is a resource
in optical experiments.

the spread of the global pandemic and help relieve the burden on medical
facilities. Currently, limited testing locations and expensive equipment pose
difficulties for individuals trying to be tested, especially in low-resource
settings. Researchers have successfully presented models for detecting COVID-19
infection status using audio samples recorded in clinical settings [5, 15],
suggesting that audio-based Artificial Intelligence models can be used to
identify COVID-19. Such models have the potential to be deployed on smartphones
for fast, widespread, and low-resource testing. However, while previous studies
have trained models on cleaned audio samples collected mainly from clinical
settings, audio samples collected from average smartphones may yield suboptimal
quality data that is different from the clean data that models were trained on.
This discrepancy may add a bias that affects COVID-19 status predictions. To
tackle this issue, we propose a multi-branch deep learning network that is
trained and tested on crowdsourced data where most of the data has not been
manually processed and cleaned. Furthermore, the model achieves state-of-art
results for the COUGHVID dataset [16]. After breaking down results for each
category, we have shown an AUC of 0.99 for audio samples with COVID-19 positive
labels.

Dirac semi-metal in a real material Tl(TeMo)$_3$, we study the behavior of
electrons tunneling through a potential barrier in such systems. To clearly
investigate effects from different contributions to the Hamiltonian we study
the model in various limits. First, in the limit of a very thin material where
the linearly dispersive $z$-direction is frozen out at zero momentum and the
dispersion in the $x$-$y$ plane is rotationally symmetric. In this limit we
find a Klein tunneling reminiscent of what is observed in single layer graphene
and linearly dispersive Dirac semi-metals. Second, an increase in thickness of
the material leads to the possibility of a non-zero momentum eigenvalue $k_z$
that acts as an effective mass term in the Hamiltonian. We find that these lead
to a suppression of Klein tunneling. Third, the inclusion of an anisotropy
parameter $\lambda\neq 1$ leads to a breaking of rotational invariance.
Furthermore, we observed that for different values of incident angle $\theta$
and anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ the Hamiltonian supports different numbers
of modes propagating to infinity. We display this effect in form of a diagram
that is similar to a phase diagram of a distant detector. Fourth, we consider
coexistence of both anisotropy and non-zero $k_z$ but do not find any effect
that is unique to the interplay between non-zero momentum $k_z$ and anisotropy
parameter $\lambda$. Last, we studied the case of a barrier that was placed in
the linearly dispersive direction and found Klein tunneling $T-1\propto
\theta^6+\mathcal{O}(\theta^8)$ that is enhanced when compared to the Klein
tunneling in linear Dirac semi-metals or graphene where $T-1\propto
\theta^2+\mathcal{O}(\theta^4)$.

theory has been found. We develop such a general theory based on novel
necessary and sufficient algebraic criteria for persistently oscillating
eigenmodes (limit cycles) of time-independent quantum master equations. We show
these eigenmodes must be quantum coherent and give an exact analytical solution
for all such dynamics in terms of a dynamical symmetry algebra. Using our
theory, we study both stable synchronization and metastable/transient
synchronization. We use our theory to fully characterise spontaneous
synchronization of autonomous systems. Moreover, we give compact algebraic
criteria that may be used to prove absence of synchronization. We demonstrate
synchronization in several systems relevant for various fermionic cold atom
experiments.

tolls in the world during the first wave, Northern Italy. We do not find any
evidence of a sizable COVID-19 harvesting effect, neither in the summer months

According to our estimates, only a minor share of the total excess deaths
detected in Northern Italian municipalities over the entire period under

of COVID-19. A slightly higher share is detected for the most severely affected
areas (the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia, in particular), but even in these
territories, the harvesting effect can only account for less than 20% of excess
deaths. Furthermore, the lower mortality rates observed in these areas at the

harvesting effect, including behavioral change and some degree of temporary
herd immunity. The very limited presence of short-run mortality displacement
restates the case for containment policies aimed at minimizing the health

prioritising vulnerable sections of the population to receive the vaccine, an
ideal degree-based vaccination strategy uses fine-grained contact networks to
prioritise vaccine recipients. This strategy is costly and impractical due to
the enormous amount of specific contact information needed. It also does not
capture indirect famine or aerosol-based transmission. We recently proposed a

which takes into account both direct and indirect transmission and is based on
the types of places people visit. IMV was shown to be cost-efficient in the

the proposed strategy achieves nearly five times the efficiency of random
vaccination and performs comparably to the degree-based strategy, while
significantly reducing the data collection requirements.

effective treatment for aortic diseases. This study aims to evaluate the
biomechanical implications of the implanted endograft after TEVAR. We present a
novel image-based, patient-specific, fluid-structure computational framework.
The geometries of blood, endograft, and aortic wall were reconstructed based on
clinical images. Patient-specific measurement data was collected to determine
the parameters of the three-element Windkessel. We designed three postoperative
scenarios with rigid wall assumption, blood-wall interaction,
blood-endograft-wall interplay, respectively, where a two-way fluid-structure
interaction (FSI) method was applied to predict the deformation of the
composite stent-wall. Computational results were validated with Doppler
ultrasound data. Results show that the rigid wall assumption fails to predict
the waveforms of blood outflow and energy loss (EL). The complete storage and
release process of blood flow energy, which consists of four phases is captured
by the FSI method. The endograft implantation would weaken the buffer function
of the aorta and reduce mean EL by 19.1%. The closed curve area of wall
pressure and aortic volume could indicate the EL caused by the interaction
between blood flow and wall deformation, which accounts for 68.8% of the total
EL. Both the FSI and endograft have a slight effect on wall shear
stress-related-indices. The deformability of the composite stent-wall region is
remarkably limited by the endograft. Our results highlight the importance of
considering the interaction between blood flow, the implanted endograft, and
the aortic wall to acquire physiologically accurate hemodynamics in post-TEVAR
computational studies and the deformation of the aortic wall is responsible for
the major EL of the blood flow.

the Aharonov-Bohm effect to be physically real (which I dub: 'the potentials
view'). I give a historico-philosophical presentation of this view and assess
its prospects, more precisely than has so far been done in the literature.
Taking the potential as physically real runs prima facie into
'gauge-underdetermination': different gauge choices represent different
physical states of affairs and hence different theories. I then illustrate this
theme by what I take to be the basic insight of the AB effect for the
potentials view, namely that the gauge equivalence class that directly
corresponds to the electric and magnetic fields (which I call the Wide
Equivalence Class) is too wide, i.e., the Narrow Equivalence Class encodes
additional physical degrees of freedom: these only play a distinct role in a
multiply-connected space. There is a trade-off between explanatory power and
gauge symmetries. Although this narrower equivalence class gives a explanation
in terms of `local interactions', locality is not satisfied in the sense of
signal locality. It is therefore intellectually mandatory to seek desiderata
that will distinguish even within these narrower equivalence classes, i.e. will
prefer some elements of such an equivalence class over others. I consider
various formulations of locality, such as Bell locality, local interaction
Hamiltonians, and signal locality. I show that Bell locality can only be
evaluated if one fixes the gauge freedom completely. Yet, an explanation in
terms of signal locality can be accommodated by the Lorenz gauge: the
potentials propagate in waves at finite speed. I therefore suggest the Lorenz
gauge potentials theory -- an even narrower gauge equivalence relation -- as
the ontology of electrodynamics.

distributions are the same. To this end, a key requirement is to develop models
that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG), i.e.,
out-of-distribution generalization, has attracted increasing interests in
recent years. Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one
or several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn
a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. Great progress has been
made in the area of domain generalization for years. This paper presents the
first review of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal
definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. We then
thoroughly review the theories related to domain generalization and carefully
analyze the theory behind generalization. We categorize recent algorithms into
three classes: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning
strategy, and present several popular algorithms in detail for each category.
Third, we introduce the commonly used datasets, applications, and our
open-sourced codebase for fair evaluation. Finally, we summarize existing
literature and present some potential research topics for the future.

wide-area time-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) keeps increasing. As
conventional cellular technologies are hard to be directly used for wide-area
time-sensitive IoT, it is beneficial to use non-terrestrial infrastructures
including satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where a
non-terrestrial network (NTN) can be built under the cell-free architecture.
Driven by the time-sensitive requirements and uneven distribution of IoT
devices, the NTN is required to be empowered by mobile edge computing (MEC)
while providing oasis-oriented on-demand coverage for the devices.
Nevertheless, communication and MEC systems are coupled with each other under
the influence of complex propagation environment in the MEC-empowered NTN,
which makes it hard to orchestrate the resources. In this paper, we propose a
process-oriented framework to design the communication and MEC systems in a
time-division manner. Under this framework, the large-scale channel state
information (CSI) is used to characterize the complex propagation environment
with an affordable cost, where a non-convex latency minimization problem is
formulated. After that, the approximated problem is given and it can be
decomposed into subproblems. These subproblems are further solved in an
iterative way. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
process-oriented scheme over other algorithms. These results also indicate that
the payload deployments of UAVs should be appropriately predesigned to improve
the efficiency of resource use. Furthermore, the results imply that it is
advantageous to integrate NTN with MEC for wide-area time-sensitive IoT.

of targeted intervention policies oriented to children and their families. We
perform our analysis by means of a campaign of Monte Carlo simulations. Our
findings suggest that, in a phase with NPIs enacted but in-person education,
children play a key role in the spreading of COVID-19. Interestingly, we show
that children's testing might be an important tool to flatten the epidemic

"2103.14698","Jin Sano","Jin Sano","Implementing G-Machine in HyperLMNtal",,,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Since language processing systems generally allocate/discard memory with
complex reference relationships, including circular and indirect references,
their implementation is often not trivial. Here, the allocated memory and the
references can be abstracted to the labeled vertices and edges of a graph. And
there exists a graph rewriting language, a programming language or a
calculation model that can handle graph intuitively, safely and efficiently.
Therefore, the implementation of a language processing system can be highly
expected as an application field of graph rewriting language. To show this, in
this research, we implemented G-machine, the virtual machine for lazy
evaluation, in hypergraph rewriting language, HyperLMNtal.

have observed analogues, but on which the theory is shaped, giving an
understanding what is fundamentally possible within its framework. Such
solutions include wormholes, tunnels that connect distant regions in spacetime.
Although not a single wormhole has yet been discovered, there is a large number
of works devoted to their study, thanks to which wormholes as a class of
solutions become firmly established in modern science. In this paper, we
consider two topologically nontrivial types of solutions related to wormholes.
First: wormholes that can open and close. In this relation, we will discuss
topological censorship theorems, which under certain conditions prohibit
changing topology. We will also discuss known ways to circumvent these
theorems. Using analytical and numerical methods, as well as visualization, we
will construct an example of an opening and closing wormhole with the
dimensions of the central black hole in the Milky Way galaxy. Our construction
continues the work by Kardashev, Novikov and Shatskiy, in which a static
wormhole with the same parameters was considered. The second type is a
modification of Visser's dihedral wormhole solution for a dynamic case, which
can be considered as a model of a teleportation event.

  FACTS",,,,,"eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The transmission system operators (TSOs) are responsible to provide secure
and efficient access to the transmission system for all stakeholders. This task
is gradually getting challenging due to the demand growth, demand uncertainty,
rapid changes in generation mix, and market policies. Traditionally, the TSOs
try to maximize the technical performance of the transmission network via
building new overhead lines or physical hardening. However, obtaining public
acceptance for building new lines is not an easy step in this procedure. For
this reason, the TSOs try to capture the capabilities of existing assets. This
paper investigates the use of modular FACTS devices (to alter the line
characteristics) for improving the capability of transmission network in
serving the uncertain demand without the need for building new overhead lines.
The proposed method considers the uncertainty of demands and controls the
utilization of existing transmission assets. The mathematical results obtained
are validated with a complete non-linear simulation model of three transmission
networks.
