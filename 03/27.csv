  Maximization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human-designed data augmentation strategies have been replaced by
automatically learned augmentation policy in the past two years. Specifically,
recent work has empirically shown that the superior performance of the
automated data augmentation methods stems from increasing the diversity of
augmented data \cite{autoaug, randaug}. However, two factors regarding the
diversity of augmented data are still missing: 1) the explicit definition (and
thus measurement) of diversity and 2) the quantifiable relationship between
diversity and its regularization effects. To bridge this gap, we propose a
diversity measure called Variance Diversity and theoretically show that the
regularization effect of data augmentation is promised by Variance Diversity.
We validate in experiments that the relative gain from automated data
augmentation in test accuracy is highly correlated to Variance Diversity. An
unsupervised sampling-based framework, \textbf{DivAug}, is designed to directly
maximize Variance Diversity and hence strengthen the regularization effect.
Without requiring a separate search process, the performance gain from DivAug
is comparable with the state-of-the-art method with better efficiency.
Moreover, under the semi-supervised setting, our framework can further improve
the performance of semi-supervised learning algorithms compared to RandAugment,
making it highly applicable to real-world problems, where labeled data is
scarce. The code is available at

Collaborative robotics is an active research area where Internet of Things

Considering that no single technology can currently solve the problem of
continuous worker monitoring, the paper targets the development of an IoT
multisensor data fusion (MDF) platform. It is based on an edge-cloud
architecture that supports the combination and transformation of multiple
sensing technologies to enable the passive and anonymous detection of workers.
Multidimensional data acquisition from different IoT sources, signal
pre-processing, feature extraction, data distribution and fusion, along with
machine learning (ML) and computing methods are described. The proposed IoT
platform also comprises a practical solution for data fusion and analytics. It
is able to perform opportunistic and real-time perception of workers by fusing
and analyzing radio signals obtained from several interconnected IoT
components, namely a multi-antenna WiFi installation (2.4-5 GHz), a sub-THz
imaging camera (100 GHz), a network of radars (122 GHz) and infrared sensors
(8-13 {\mu}m). The performance of the proposed IoT platform is validated
through real use case scenarios inside a pilot industrial plant in which
protective human--robot distance must be guaranteed considering latency and
detection uncertainties.

Reionization (EoR) are a promising probe of the astrophysics of the first
galaxies and of cosmological parameters. In particular, the optical depth
$\tau$ to the last scattering surface of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
should be tightly constrained by direct measurements of the neutral hydrogen
state at high redshift. A robust measurement of $\tau$ from 21 cm data would
help eliminate it as a nuisance parameter from CMB estimates of cosmological
parameters. Previous proposals for extracting $\tau$ from future 21 cm datasets
have typically used the 21 cm power spectra generated by semi-numerical models
to reconstruct the reionization history. We present here a different approach
which uses convolution neural networks (CNNs) trained on mock images of the 21
cm EoR signal to extract $\tau$. We construct a CNN that improves upon on
previously proposed architectures, and perform an automated hyperparameter
optimization. We show that well-trained CNNs are able to accurately predict
$\tau$, even when removing Fourier modes that are expected to be corrupted by
bright foreground contamination of the 21 cm signal. Typical random errors for
an optimized network are less than $3.06\%$, with biases factors of several
smaller. While preliminary, this approach could yield constraints on $\tau$
that improve upon sample-variance limited measurements of the low-$\ell$ EE
observations of the CMB, making this approach a valuable complement to more
traditional methods of inferring $\tau$.

posterior ensemble, an essential yet challenging part in ensemble-based
filtering methods. The proposed framework is based on a generalised and fully
Bayesian view on the traditional ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). In the EnKF,
the updating of the ensemble is based on Gaussian assumptions, whereas in our
general setup the updating may be based on another parametric family. In
addition, we propose to formulate an optimality criterion and to find the
optimal update with respect to this criterion. The framework is fully Bayesian
in the sense that the parameters of the assumed forecast model are treated as
random variables. As a consequence, a parameter vector is simulated, for each
ensemble member, prior to the updating. In contrast to existing fully Bayesian
approaches, where the parameters are simulated conditionally on all the
forecast samples, the parameters are in our framework simulated conditionally
on both the data and all the forecast samples, except the forecast sample which
is to be updated. The proposed framework is studied in detail for two
parametric families: the linear-Gaussian model and the finite state-space
hidden Markov model. For both cases, we present simulation examples and compare
the results with existing ensemble-based filtering methods. The results of the
proposed approach indicate a promising performance. In particular, the filter
based on the linear-Gaussian model gives a more realistic representation of the
uncertainty than the traditional EnKF, and the effect of not conditioning on
the forecast sample which is to be updated when simulating the parameters is
remarkable.

break this limitation and provide useful 2-dimensional thermal and chemical

capabilities. We apply our technique to the combined phase curve data from the

different scenarios and discussed the dependence of our solution to different

multiple interpretation of this dataset are possible but our more complex model
is consistent with the presence of thermal inversions and a metal rich

Considering the difficulty of acquiring dense labels, researchers have recently

non-salient region object mining approach for weakly supervised semantic

the classification network's ability to capture global relations among disjoint

outside the salient area. To further mine the non-salient region objects, we
propose to exert the segmentation network's self-correction ability.
Specifically, a potential object mining module is proposed to reduce the
false-negative rate in pseudo labels. Moreover, we propose a non-salient region
masking module for complex images to generate masked pseudo labels. Our
non-salient region masking module helps further discover the objects in the
non-salient region. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC dataset demonstrate
state-of-the-art results compared to current methods.

determines the solid-void interface, and the density field describes the
distribution of a fictitious porous material using the solid isotropic material
with penalization. These fields are governed by two sets of independent
optimization variables which are initially coupled using a penalty for hole
nucleation. The strength of the density field penalization and projection are
gradually increased through the optimization process to promote a 0-1 density
distribution. This treatment of the density field combined with a second
penalty that regulates the evolution of the density field in the void phase,
mitigate the appearance of small design features. The minimum feature size of
optimized designs is controlled by the radius of the linear filter applied to
the density optimization variables. The structural response is predicted by the
extended finite element method, the sensitivities by the adjoint method, and
the optimization variables are updated by a gradient-based optimization
algorithm. Numerical examples investigate the robustness of this approach with
respect to algorithmic parameters and mesh refinement. The results show the
applicability of the combined density level set topology optimization approach

additional computational cost due to an increased number of optimization

solve the risk-averse optimal control (RAOC) problem for discrete-time
nonlinear systems. While successful RL algorithms have been presented to learn
optimal control solutions under epistemic uncertainties (i.e., lack of
knowledge of system dynamics), they do so by optimizing the expected utility of
outcomes, which ignores the variance of cost under aleatory uncertainties
(i.e., randomness). Performance-critical systems, however, must not only
optimize the expected performance, but also reduce its variance to avoid
performance fluctuation during RL's course of operation. To solve the RAOC
problem, this paper presents the following three variants of RL algorithms and
analyze their advantages and preferences for different situations/systems: 1) a
one-shot static convex program -based RL, 2) an iterative value iteration (VI)
algorithm that solves a linear programming (LP) optimization at each iteration,
and 3) an iterative policy iteration (PI) algorithm that solves a convex
optimization at each iteration and guarantees the stability of the consecutive
control policies. Convergence of the exact optimization problems, which are
infinite-dimensional in all three cases, to the optimal risk-averse value
function is shown. To turn these optimization problems into standard
optimization problems with finite decision variables and constraints, function
approximation for value estimations as well as constraint sampling are
leveraged. Data-driven implementations of these algorithms are provided based
on Q-function which enables learning the optimal value without any knowledge of
the system dynamics. The performance of the approximated solutions is also
verified through a weighted sup-norm bound and the Lyapunov bound. A simulation
example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the presented approach.

work, we present a more detailed analysis. As a compelling consequence, this
setup provides a new mechanism for simultaneous baryogenesis and right-handed
neutrino creation by the chiral anomaly of $W_R$ in inflation. The lightest
right-handed neutrino is the dark matter candidate. This setup has two unknown
fundamental scales, i.e., the scale of inflation and left-right symmetry
breaking $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}\rightarrow U(1)_{Y}$. Sufficient matter
creation demands the left-right symmetry breaking scale happens shortly after
the end of inflation. Interestingly, it prefers left-right symmetry breaking
scales above $10^{10}~GeV$, which is in the range suggested by the
non-supersymmetric SO(10) Grand Unified Theory with an intermediate left-right
symmetry scale. Although $W_R$ gauge field generates equal amounts of
right-handed baryons and leptons in inflation, i.e. $B-L=0$, in the Standard
Model sub-sector $B-L_{SM}\neq 0$. A key aspect of this setup is that $SU(2)_R$
sphalerons are never in equilibrium, and the primordial $B-L_{SM}$ is conserved
by the Standard Model interactions. This setup yields a deep connection between
CP violation in physics of inflation and matter creation (visible and dark);
hence it can naturally explain the observed coincidences among cosmological
parameters, i.e., $\eta_{B}\simeq 0.3 P_{\zeta}$ and $\Omega_{DM}\simeq
5\Omega_{B}$. The $SU(2)_R$-axion inflation comes with a cosmological smoking
gun; chiral, non-Gaussian, and blue-tilted gravitational wave background, which

hermitian connection $\nabla$ with curvature $F_\nabla$. While the critical
points of these functionals have been well-studied in dimension two by the
gauge theory community, it was shown in previous work of the second- and
third-named authors that critical points in higher dimension converge as
$\epsilon\to 0$ (in an appropriate sense) to minimal submanifolds of
codimension two, with strong parallels to the correspondence between the
Allen-Cahn equations and minimal hypersurfaces.
  In this paper, we complement this idea by showing the $\Gamma$-convergence of
$E_\epsilon$ to ($2\pi$ times) the codimension two area: more precisely, given
a family of couples $(u_\epsilon,\nabla_\epsilon)$ with $\sup_\epsilon
E_\epsilon(u_\epsilon,\nabla_\epsilon)<\infty$, we prove that a suitable gauge
invariant Jacobian $J(u_\epsilon,\nabla_\epsilon)$ converges to an integral
$(n-2)$-cycle $\Gamma$, in the homology class dual to the Euler class $c_1(L)$,
with mass $2 \pi \mathbb{M}(\Gamma)\le\liminf_{\epsilon \rightarrow
0}E_\epsilon(u_\epsilon,\nabla_\epsilon)$. We also obtain a recovery sequence
for any integral cycle in this homology class.
  Finally, we apply these techniques to compare min-max values for the
$(n-2)$-area from the Almgren-Pitts theory with those obtained from the
Yang-Mills-Higgs framework, showing that the former values always provide a
lower bound for the latter. As an ingredient, we also establish a Huisken-type
monotonicity result along the gradient flow of $E_{\epsilon}$.

networks for image restoration problems, such as single image super resolution.
The loss function should encourage natural and perceptually pleasing results. A
popular choice for a loss is a pre-trained network, such as VGG, which is used
as a feature extractor for computing the difference between restored and
reference images. However, such an approach has multiple drawbacks: it is
computationally expensive, requires regularization and hyper-parameter tuning,
and involves a large network trained on an unrelated task. Furthermore, it has
been observed that there is no single loss function that works best across all
applications and across different datasets. In this work, we instead propose to
train a set of loss functions that are application specific in nature. Our loss
function comprises a series of discriminators that are trained to detect and
penalize the presence of application-specific artifacts. We show that a single
natural image and corresponding distortions are sufficient to train our feature
extractor that outperforms state-of-the-art loss functions in applications like
single image super resolution, denoising, and JPEG artifact removal. Finally,
we conclude that an effective loss function does not have to be a good
predictor of perceived image quality, but instead needs to be specialized in
identifying the distortions for a given restoration method.

is factorized, based on a proposed algorithm, to construct an LPV

computing. The new method employs a multiple-fold dimension reduction procedure
using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and shows great promises for modeling
large-scale data that cannot be stored nor analyzed by a single machine. Each
computer at the basic level performs a PCA to extract common factors among the
time series assigned to it and transfers those factors to one and only one node
of the second level. Each 2nd-level computer collects the common factors from
its subordinates and performs another PCA to select the 2nd-level common
factors. This process is repeated until the central server is reached, which
collects common factors from its direct subordinates and performs a final PCA
to select the global common factors. The noise terms of the 2nd-level
approximate factor model are the unique common factors of the 1st-level
clusters. We focus on the case of 2 levels in our theoretical derivations, but
the idea can easily be generalized to any finite number of hierarchies. We
discuss some clustering methods when the group memberships are unknown and
introduce a new diffusion index approach to forecasting. We further extend the
analysis to unit-root nonstationary time series. Asymptotic properties of the
proposed method are derived for the diverging dimension of the data in each
computing unit and the sample size $T$. We use both simulated data and real
examples to assess the performance of the proposed method in finite samples,

weight matrices instead of brutally predicting kernels from point positions.

However,
they are unable to learn long-term dependencies because of their inherent
sequential nature. As a solution, Vaswani et al. introduced the Transformer, a
model solely based on the attention mechanism that is able to relate any two
positions of the input sequence, hence modelling arbitrary long dependencies.
The Transformer has improved the state-of-the-art across numerous sequence
modelling tasks. However, its effectiveness comes at the expense of a quadratic
computational and memory complexity with respect to the sequence length,
hindering its adoption. Fortunately, the deep learning community has always
been interested in improving the models' efficiency, leading to a plethora of
solutions such as parameter sharing, pruning, mixed-precision, and knowledge
distillation. Recently, researchers have directly addressed the Transformer's
limitation by designing lower-complexity alternatives such as the Longformer,
Reformer, Linformer, and Performer. However, due to the wide range of
solutions, it has become challenging for researchers and practitioners to
determine which methods to apply in practice in order to meet the desired
trade-off between capacity, computation, and memory. This survey addresses this
issue by investigating popular approaches to make Transformers faster and
lighter and by providing a comprehensive explanation of the methods' strengths,
limitations, and underlying assumptions.

arbitrary plane wave. Volkov states, as well as free photon states, are not
stable in the presence of the background plane-wave field but ""decay"" as
electrons/positrons can emit photons and photons can transform into
electron-positron pairs. By using the solutions of the corresponding
Schwinger-Dyson equations within the locally-constant field approximation, we
compute the probabilities of nonlinear single Compton scattering and nonlinear
Breit-Wheeler pair production by including the effects of the decay of
electron, positron, and photon states. As a result, we find that the
probabilities of these processes can be expressed as the integral over the
light-cone time of the known probabilities valid for stable states per unit of
light-cone time times a light-cone time-dependent exponential damping function
for each interacting particle. The exponential function for an incoming
(outgoing) either electron/positron or photon at each light-cone time
corresponds to the total probability that either the electron/positron emits a
photon via nonlinear Compton scattering or the photon transforms into an
electron-positron pair via nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production until that
light-cone time (from that light-cone time on). It is interesting that the
exponential damping terms depend not only on the particles momentum but also on
their spin (for electrons/positrons) and polarization (for photons). This
additional dependence on the discrete quantum numbers prevents the application
of the electron/positron spin and photon polarization sum-rules, which
significantly simplify the computations in the perturbative regime.

given by the Jacobson-Myers (JM) functional. As usual, due to the divergent
Weyl factor in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the boundary metric for
Asymptotically AdS spaces, this entropy functional is infinite. By considering
the Kounterterm renormalization procedure, which utilizes extrinsic boundary
counterterms in order to renormalize the on-shell Lovelock gravity action for

a new generative approach for highly transferable targeted perturbations
(\ours). We note that the existing methods are less suitable for this task due
to their reliance on class-boundary information that changes from one model to
another, thus reducing transferability. In contrast, our approach matches the
perturbed image `distribution' with that of the target class, leading to high
targeted transferability rates. To this end, we propose a new objective
function that not only aligns the global distributions of source and target
images, but also matches the local neighbourhood structure between the two
domains. Based on the proposed objective, we train a generator function that
can adaptively synthesize perturbations specific to a given input. Our
generative approach is independent of the source or target domain labels, while
consistently performs well against state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of

proposed as massive black hole binary (MBHB) candidates. In such scenarios the
periodicity can be due to relativistic Doppler-boosting of the emitted light.
This hypothesis can be tested through the timing of scattered polarized light.
Following the results of polarization studies in type I nuclei and of dynamical
studies of MBHBs with circumbinary discs, we assume a coplanar equatorial
scattering ring, whose elements contribute differently to the total polarized
flux, due to different scattering angles, levels of Doppler boost, and
line-of-sight time delays. We find that in the presence of a MBHB, both the
degree of polarization and the polarization angle have periodic modulations.
The minimum of the polarization degree approximately coincides with the peak of
the light curve, regardless of the scattering ring size. The polarization angle
oscillates around the semi-minor axis of the projected MBHB orbital ellipse,
with a frequency equal either to the binary's orbital frequency (for large
scattering screen radii), or twice this value (for smaller scattering
structures). These distinctive features can be used to probe the nature of
periodic MBHB candidates and to compile catalogs of the most promising sub-pc
MBHBs. The identification of such polarization features in gravitational-wave
detected MBHBs would enormously increase the amount of physical information
about the sources, allowing the measurement of the individual masses of the
binary components, and the orientation of the line of nodes on the sky, even
for monochromatic gravitational wave signals.

and suppression of large transverse momentum ($p_T$) hadrons, respectively, two
of the most important phenomena leading to the discovery of a strongly coupled
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. A consistent
description of the hadron suppression factor $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$, especially at
intermediate $p_T$, however, remains a challenge. We solve this long-standing
$R_{AA}\otimes v_2$ puzzle by including quark coalescence for hadronization and
final state hadron cascade in the coupled linear Boltzmann transport-hydro
model that combines concurrent jet transport and hydrodynamic evolution of the
bulk medium. We illustrate that quark coalescence and hadron cascade, two keys
to solving the puzzle, also lead to a splitting of $v_2$ for pions, kaons and
protons in the intermediate $p_T$ region. We demonstrate for the first time
that experimental data on $R_{AA}$, $v_2$ and their hadron flavor dependence
from low to intermediate and high $p_T$ in high-energy heavy-ion collisions can
be understood within this coupled framework.

important feature to understand new physics interactions and can be exploited
to improve our sensitivity to DM. In particular, circular polarisation can be
generated from Beyond the Standard Model interactions if they violate parity
and there is an asymmetry in the number of particles which participate in the
interaction. In this work, we consider a simplified model for fermionic
(Majorana) DM and study the circularly polarised gamma rays below 10 GeV from
the scattering of cosmic ray electrons on DM. We calculate the differential
flux of positive and negative polarised photons from the Galactic Center and
show that the degree of circular polarization can reach up to 90%. Finally,
once collider and DM constraints have been taken into account, we estimate the
required sensitivity from future experiments to detect this signal finding
that, although a distinctive peak will be present in the photon flux spectrum,
a near future observation is unlikely. However, different sources or models not
considered in this work could provide higher intensity fluxes, leading to a
possible detection by e-ASTROGAM. In the event of a discovery, we argue that
the polarisation fraction is a valuable characterisation feature of the new
sector.

dynamics a promising tool for exploring the Kitaev spin liquid candidate
materials. In particular, we will focus on the signature of the fractionalized
excitations in the thermodynamic behaviour of the sound attenuation and the
phonon Hall viscosity: The former describes the phonon decay into the
fractionalized excitations, and the later is the leading order time reversal
symmetry breaking effect on the acoustic phonon. We find that the angular
dependence of the attenuation coefficient and its magnitude are modified by the
thermal excitation of the $Z_2$ fluxes. The strength of this effect strongly
depends on the relative magnitude of the sound velocity and the Fermi velocity
characterizing the low-energy Majorana fermions. We also show that the Hall
viscosity is strongly suppressed by the increase of the density of the $Z_2$
fluxes at finite temperatures. All these observations reflect the effects of
the emergent disorder on the Majorana fermions introduced by the $Z_2$ fluxes.
Our analysis is based on the complementary analytical calculations in the
low-temperature zero-flux sector, and numerical calculations in the
inhomogeneous flux sectors at intermediate and high temperatures with

this paper, we study extensively different aspects of this approach, including
its computational limits and achievable accuracy. We focus on ground-based
detectors with current and future sensitivities, we first perform the analysis
of an extensive set of simulated data with a hierarchical Bayesian scheme
inferring population and cosmological parameters. We consider a population
model (power-law plus Gaussian) which exhibits characteristic scales (extremes
of the mass spectrum, presence of an accumulation point) that allows an
indirect estimate of the source redshift. Our analysis of this catalog
highlights and quantifies the tight interplay between source population and
cosmological parameters, as well as the influence of initial assumptions
(whether formulated on the source or cosmological parameters). We then validate
our results by an ""end-to-end"" analysis using simulated GW data and posterior
samples generated from Bayesian samplers used for GW parameter estimation, thus
mirroring the analysis chain used for observational data for the first time in
literature. Our results then lead us to re-examine the estimation of $H_0$
obtained with GWTC-1, and we show explicitly how population assumptions impact
the final $H_0$ result. Our results underline the importance of inferring
population and cosmological parameters jointly (and not separately as is often
assumed). The only exception, as we discuss, is if an electromagnetic
counterpart was to be observed for all the BBH events: then the population
assumptions have less impact on the estimation of cosmological parameters.

best-fit values of the DM decay width and the associated $95\%$ confidence

Additionally, we have extended our analysis by including two other background
models available in the literature and in each case, the corresponding limits
on the DM decay width are estimated for DM mass ($m_\chi$) in the domain $2 -
18$ keV. By comparing the constraints, obtained by fitting the XENON1T data,
with the upper limits arising from various existing astrophysical and

fair amount of the DM parameter space is allowed at $95\%$ C.L. for DM masses
outside the range $3.5\,{\rm keV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 8.5\,{\rm keV}$.
However, in case of other two background models, reasonable parts of the DM
parameter space are favoured at $95\%$ C.L. by all astrophysical data for all

with extensive applications in robotics. When available, depth images provide
helpful geometric cues that complement the RGB texture information and help to
identify discriminative scene image features. Depth sensing technology
developed fast in the last years and a great variety of 3D cameras have been
introduced, each with different acquisition properties. However, those
properties are often neglected when targeting big data collections, so
multi-modal images are gathered disregarding their original nature. In this
work, we put under the spotlight the existence of a possibly severe domain
shift issue within multi-modality scene recognition datasets. As a consequence,
a scene classification model trained on one camera may not generalize on data
from a different camera, only providing a low recognition performance. Starting
from the well-known SUN RGB-D dataset, we designed an experimental testbed to
study this problem and we use it to benchmark the performance of existing
methods. Finally, we introduce a novel adaptive scene recognition approach that
leverages self-supervised translation between modalities. Indeed, learning to
go from RGB to depth and vice-versa is an unsupervised procedure that can be
trained jointly on data of multiple cameras and may help to bridge the gap
among the extracted feature distributions. Our experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

actions as well as long compositional sentences describing multiple sequential

available KIT Motion-Language Dataset containing 3D pose data with

the state-of-the-art on text-based motion synthesis in objective evaluations by

jet observables in heavy-ion collisions. To explore this bias, we develop a
novel analytic framework to study the quenched jet spectrum, and its
cumulative. We include many energy-loss-related effects, such as soft and hard
medium induced emissions, broadening, elastic scattering, jet fragmentation,
cone size, coherence effects, etc. We show that, different jet spectrum-based
observables are connected, e.g., the nuclear modification, spectrum shift, and
the quantile procedure. We present the first predictions for the nuclear
modification factor and the quantile procedure with cone size dependence. As an
example, we compare dijet and boson+jet events to unfold the spectrum bias
effects. We improve quark-, and gluon-jet classification using arguments based
on the cumulative. Besides pointing out its flexibility, we apply our framework
with other energy loss models such as the hybrid weak-, strong-coupling.

the fragile superposition state of a qubit alive. Long lifetimes can be
achieved for material qubit carriers as memories, at least in principle, but
not for propagating photons that are rapidly lost by absorption, diffraction or

qubit detector that heralds the photon without destroying the encoded qubit.
Such detector is envisioned to facilitate protocols where distributed tasks
depend on the successful dissemination of photonic qubits, to improve
loss-sensitive qubit measurements, and to enable certain quantum key
distribution attacks. Here we demonstrate such a detector based on a single
atom in two crossed fibre-based optical resonators, one for qubit-insensitive
atom-photon coupling, the other for atomic-state detection. We achieve a
nondestructive detection efficiency upon qubit survival of $(79\pm3)\,\%$, a
photon survival probability of $(31\pm1)\,\%$, and preserve the qubit
information with a fidelity of $(96.2\pm0.3)\,\%$. To illustrate the potential
of our detector we show that it can provide, already with current parameters,
an advantage for long-distance entanglement and quantum-state distribution,
resource optimization via qubit amplification, and detection-loophole-free Bell

pressure differences between the left ventricle and the aorta, opens and closes
during the heartbeat to ensure the correct stream direction and flow rate. In
elderly individuals or because of particular pathologies, the valve leaflets
can stiffen thus impairing the valve functioning and, in turn, the pumping
efficiency of the heart. Using a multi-physics left heart model accounting for
the electrophysiology, the active contraction of the myocardium, the
hemodynamics and the related fluid-structure-interaction, we have investigated
the changes in the flow features for different severities of the aortic valve
stenosis. We have found that, in addition to the increase of the transvalvular
pressure drop and of the systolic jet velocity, a stenotic aortic valve
significantly alters the wall shear stresses and their spatial distribution
over the aortic arch and valve leaflets, which may induce a remodelling process
of the ventricular myocardium. The numerical results from the multi-physics

the way for computational engineering aided medical diagnostic.

history produce an uncertainty in the solutions for the past evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. Constraining this history has been a target of
interdisciplinary efforts as it represents an astro-geodetic parameter whose
variation is shaped by geophysical processes, and whose imprints can be found
in the geological signal. We revisit the classical problem of its variation
during ice ages, where glacial cycles exerted a varying surface loading that
had altered the shape of the geoid. In the framework of glacial isostatic
adjustment, and with the help of a recent paleoclimatic proxy of ice volume, we
present the evolution of the dynamical ellipticity over the Cenozoic ice ages.
We map out the problem in full generality identifying major sensitivities to
surface loading and internal variations in parameter space. This constrained
evolution is aimed to be used in future astronomical computations of the

ingredients to understand the chemical history of our Galaxy. Open Clusters
(OCs) are useful for this purpose because they provide ages with good
precision.
  Aims: The aim of this work is to investigate the relations of different
chemical abundance ratios vs age traced by red clump (RC) stars in OCs.
  Methods: We analyze a large sample of 209 reliable members in 47 OCs with
available high-resolution spectroscopy. We applied a differential line-by-line
analysis to provide a comprehensive chemical study of 25 chemical species. This
sample is among the largest samples of OCs homogeneously characterized in terms
of atmospheric parameters, detailed chemistry, and ages.
  Results: In our metallicity range (-0.2<[M/H]<+0.2) we find that while most
Fe-peak and alpha elements have flat dependence with age, the s-process
elements show decreasing trends with increasing age with a remarkable knee at 1
Gyr. For Ba, Ce, Y, Mo and Zr we find a plateau at young ages (< 1 Gyr). We
investigate the relations of all possible combinations among the computed
chemical species with age. We find 19 combinations with significant slopes,
including [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al]. The ratio [Ba/alpha] is the one with the most
significant correlations found.
  Conclusions: We find that the [Y/Mg] relation found in the literature using
Solar twins is compatible with the one found here in the Solar neighbourhood.
The age-abundance relations show larger scatter for clusters at large distances
(d>1 kpc) than for the Solar neighbourhood, particularly in the outer disk. We
conclude that these relations need to be understood also in terms of the

thereby allowing application developers to focus on the unique qualities of
their particular application rather than general video processing, data

blockchain systems, which unfortunately is energy inefficient. Proof-of-Stake
(PoS) is then proposed to tackle the energy issue. The rich-get-richer concern
of PoS has been heavily debated in the blockchain community. The debate is
centered around the argument that whether rich miners possessing more stakes
will obtain higher staking rewards and further increase their potential income
in the future. In this paper, we define two types of fairness, i.e.,
expectational fairness and robust fairness, that are useful for answering this
question. In particular, expectational fairness illustrates that the expected
income of a miner is proportional to her initial investment, indicating that
the expected return on investment is a constant. To better capture the
uncertainty of mining outcomes, robust fairness is proposed to characterize
whether the return on investment concentrates to a constant with high
probability as time evolves. Our analysis shows that the classical PoW
mechanism can always preserve both types of fairness as long as the mining game
runs for a sufficiently long time. Furthermore, we observe that current PoS
blockchains implement various incentive models and discuss three
representatives, namely ML-PoS, SL-PoS and C-PoS. We find that (i) ML-PoS
(e.g., Qtum and Blackcoin) preserves expectational fairness but may not achieve
robust fairness, (ii) SL-PoS (e.g., NXT) does not protect any type of fairness,
and (iii) C-PoS (e.g., Ethereum 2.0) outperforms ML-PoS in terms of robust
fairness while still maintaining expectational fairness. Finally, massive
experiments on real blockchain systems and extensive numerical simulations are
performed to validate our analysis.

and bottom boundary layers, separated by an interior stratification. The
overlapping boundary layers evolve through three phases, i.e. a rapid
deepening, an oscillatory equilibrium and a prompt merger, separated by two
transitions. Before the merger, internal waves are observed in the stratified
layer, and they are excited mainly by Langmuir turbulence in the surface
boundary layer. These waves induce a clear modulation on the bottom-generated
turbulence, facilitating the interaction between the surface and bottom
boundary layers. After the merger, the Langmuir circulations originally
confined to the surface layer are found to grow in size and extend down to the
sea bottom (even though the surface waves do not feel the bottom), reminiscent
of the well-organized Langmuir supercells. These full-depth Langmuir
circulations promote the vertical mixing and enhance the bottom shear, leading
to a significant enhancement of turbulence levels in the vertical column.

difficult task requiring a complex decision-making policy. The learning of such
a policy requires a state representation that can encode the entire
environment. Mid-level representations that encode a vehicle's environment as
images have become a popular choice. Still, they are quite high-dimensional,
limiting their use in data-hungry approaches such as reinforcement learning. In
this article, we propose to learn a low-dimensional and rich latent
representation of the environment by leveraging the knowledge of relevant
semantic factors. To do this, we train an encoder-decoder deep neural network
to predict multiple application-relevant factors such as the trajectories of
other agents and the ego car. Furthermore, we propose a hazard signal based on
other vehicles' future trajectories and the planned route which is used in
conjunction with the learned latent representation as input to a down-stream
policy. We demonstrate that using the multi-head encoder-decoder neural network
results in a more informative representation than a standard single-head model.
In particular, the proposed representation learning and the hazard signal help
reinforcement learning to learn faster, with increased performance and less
data than baseline methods.

extending the latent position random graph model to the line graph of a random

random graph, and connecting each pair of edges incident to a common vertex in
the original graph. We prove concentration inequalities for the spectrum of a

fail to extract necessary signal for edge clustering, there exist
signal-preserving singular subspaces of the line graph that can be recovered
through a carefully-chosen projection. Moreover, we can consistently estimate
edge latent positions in a random line graph, even though such graphs are of a
random size, typically have high rank, and possess no spectral gap. Our results

topologies. However, since these energy storage components, especially
inductors, are difficult to scale down, miniaturization of switching converters
for on-chip or in-package electronics faces fundamental challenges.
Furthermore, the resulting switching currents produce electromagnetic noise,
which can cause interference problems in nearby circuits, and even acoustic
noise and mechanical vibrations that deteriorate the environment. In order to
overcome the limitations of switch-mode converters, photonic transformers,
where voltage conversion is achieved through the use of light emission and

efficiency is significantly below that of the switch-mode converter. Here we
perform a theoretical analysis based on detailed balance, which shows that with
a monolithically integrated design that enables efficient photon transport, the
photonic transformer can operate with a near-unity conversion efficiency and
high voltage conversion ratio. We validate the theoretical analysis with an
experiment on a transformer constructed with off-the-shelf discrete components.
Our experiment showcases near noiseless operation, as well as a voltage
conversion ratio that is significantly higher than obtained in previous

we investigate the feasibility of porting a HEP parameterized calorimeter
simulation code to GPUs. We have chosen to use FastCaloSim, the ATLAS fast
parametrized calorimeter simulation. While FastCaloSim is sufficiently fast
such that it does not impose a bottleneck in detector simulations overall,
significant speed-ups in the processing of large samples can be achieved from
GPU parallelization at both the particle (intra-event) and event levels; this
is especially beneficial in conditions expected at the high-luminosity LHC,
where extremely high per-event particle multiplicities will result from the
many simultaneous proton-proton collisions. We report our experience with
porting FastCaloSim to NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. A preliminary Kokkos
implementation of FastCaloSim for portability to other parallel architectures

these assumptions are questionable in thermophotovoltaic devices operating in

fluctuational electrodynamics with the drift-diffusion model is developed to
tackle the coupled photon and charge transport problem, enabling the
determination of the spatial profile of photon chemical potential beyond the

generates the facial image and/ or other biometrics of the individual while the
lack of a match returns a null result. By jointly encrypting DNA fingerprints
and other biometrics using the unique STRs generated keys, our approach ensures
perfect privacy of the encrypted information with decryption of only the record
with STRs matching the query. This safeguards the information of other
individuals in the same database. The proposed approach can also be used to
securely authenticate the identity of individuals or biological material in
scenarios beyond forensics including tracking the identity of samples for

real-world data in many different settings. Despite significant computational
advances, PH algorithms do not yet scale to large datasets preventing
interesting applications. One approach to address computational issues posed by
PH is to select a set of landmarks by subsampling from the data. Currently,
these landmark points are chosen either at random or using the maxmin
algorithm. Neither is ideal as random selection tends to favour dense areas of
the data while the maxmin algorithm is very sensitive to noise. Here, we
propose a novel approach to select landmarks specifically for PH that preserves
coarse topological information of the original dataset. Our method is motivated
by the Mayer-Vietoris sequence and requires only local PH computation thus
enabling efficient computation. We test our landmarks on artificial datasets
which contain different levels of noise and compare them to standard landmark
selection techniques. We demonstrate that our landmark selection outperforms
standard methods as well as a subsampling technique based on an outlier-robust
version of the $k$--means algorithm for low sampling densities in noisy data
with respect to robustness to outliers.

problems is essential to demonstrate an eventual quantum advantage of
Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices over their classical

time-evolution operator $U(t) = e^{i\mathcal{\hat{H}}t}$ where
$\mathcal{\hat{H}}$ is the electronic structure Hamiltonian, or to simulate
$\mathcal{\hat{H}}$ directly (when written as a linear combination of
unitaries) by using block encoding or ""qubitization"" techniques. A fundamental
measure quantifying the practical implementation complexity of these quantum
algorithms is the so-called ""1-norm"" of the qubit-representation of the
Hamiltonian, which can be reduced by writing the Hamiltonian in factorized or
tensor-hypercontracted forms for instance. In this work, we investigate the
effect of classical pre-optimization of the electronic structure Hamiltonian
representation, via single-particle basis transformation, on the 1-norm.
Specifically, we employ several localization schemes and benchmark the 1-norm
of several systems of different sizes (number of atoms and active space sizes).
We also derive a new formula for the 1-norm as a function of the electronic
integrals, and use this quantity as a cost function for an orbital-optimization
scheme that improves over localization schemes. This paper gives more insights
about the importance of the 1-norm in quantum computing for quantum chemistry,
and provides simple ways of decreasing its value to reduce the complexity of
quantum algorithms.

validate directly on the right-censored log-likelihood, due to its
intractability, and resort to the aforementioned alternatives, i.e., non-proper

capable of directly optimizing log-likelihood using a monotonic restriction on
the time-dependent weights, coined SurvivalMonotonic-net (SuMo-net). SuMo-net

preformed liquid tin targets by several-ns-long 2-$\mu$m-wavelength laser
pulses, are studied in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime. In a two-pulse
scheme, a pre-pulse laser is first used to deform tin microdroplets into thin,
extended disks before the main (2$\mu$m) pulse creates the EUV-emitting plasma.
Irradiating 30- to 300-$\mu$m-diameter targets with 2-$\mu$m laser pulses, we
find that the efficiency in creating EUV light around 13.5nm follows the
fraction of laser light that overlaps with the target. Next, the effects of a
change in 2-$\mu$m drive laser intensity (0.6-1.8$\times 10^{11}$W/cm$^2$) and
pulse duration (3.7-7.4ns) are studied. It is found that the angular dependence
of the emission of light within a 2\% bandwidth around 13.5nm and within the
backward 2$\pi$ hemisphere around the incoming laser beam is almost independent
of intensity and duration of the 2-$\mu$m drive laser. With increasing target
diameter, the emission in this 2\% bandwidth becomes increasingly anisotropic,
with a greater fraction of light being emitted into the hemisphere of the
incoming laser beam. For direct comparison, a similar set of experiments is
performed with a 1-$\mu$m-wavelength drive laser. Emission spectra, recorded in
a 5.5-25.5nm wavelength range, show significant self-absorption of light around
13.5nm in the 1-$\mu$m case, while in the 2-$\mu$m case only an opacity-related
broadening of the spectral feature at 13.5nm is observed. This work
demonstrates the enhanced capabilities and performance of 2-$\mu$m-driven
plasmas produced from disk targets when compared to 1-$\mu$m-driven plasmas,
providing strong motivation for the use of 2-$\mu$m lasers as drive lasers in
future high-power sources of EUV light.

and granular bead packings to crumpled metallic sheets, exhibit slow stress
relaxation when compressed. Experimentally they show a non-monotonic stress
response when decompressed somewhat after an initial compression, i.e. under a
two-step, Kovacs-like protocol. It turns out that from this response one can
tell for how long the system was in a compressed state, suggesting an
interpretation as a memory effect. In this work we use a model of an athermal

explore this phenomenon through in-silico experiments. Using extensive

identical phenomenology in the stress response under a two-step protocol. Our

three-step protocol, which consists of a compression followed by a
decompression and then a final compression. We show that the observed response
in both two-step and three-step protocols can be understood using Linear
Response Theory. In particular, a linear scaling with age for the two-step
protocol arises generically for slow linear responses with power law or
logarithmic decay and does not in itself point to any underlying aging

linear beam traveling wave tube (TWT) with a realistic helix waveguide
slow-wave structure (SWS). The interaction is formulated by an analytical model
that is a generalization of the Pierce model, assuming a one-dimensional
electron flow along a dispersive single-mode guiding SWS and taking into
account space-charge effects in the system. The augmented model using phase
velocity and characteristic impedance obtained via full-wave simulations is
validated by calculating gain versus frequency and comparing it with that from
more complex electron beam simulators. This comparison also shows the accuracy
of our new model compared with respect to the non-dispersive Pierce model. EPDs
are then investigated using the augmented model, observing the coalescence of
complex-valued wavenumbers and the system's eigenvectors. The point in the
complex dispersion diagram at which the TWT-system starts/ceases to exhibit a
convection instability, i.e., a mode starts/ceases to grow exponentially along
the TWT, is the EPD. We also demonstrate the EPD existence by showing that the
Puiseux fractional power series expansion well approximates the bifurcation of
the dispersion diagram at the EPD. This latter concept also explains the
""exceptional"" sensitivity of the TWT-system to changes in the beam's electron
velocity when operating near an EPD.

compression. We formulate the speech coding problem as an autoencoding task,
where a convolutional neural network (CNN) performs encoding and decoding as a
neural waveform codec (NWC) during its feedforward routine. The proposed NWC
also defines quantization and entropy coding as a trainable module, so the
coding artifacts and bitrate control are handled during the optimization
process. We achieve efficiency by introducing compact model components to NWC,
such as gated residual networks and depthwise separable convolution.
Furthermore, the proposed models are with a scalable architecture, cross-module
residual learning (CMRL), to cover a wide range of bitrates. To this end, we
employ the residual coding concept to concatenate multiple NWC autoencoding
modules, where each NWC module performs residual coding to restore any
reconstruction loss that its preceding modules have created. CMRL can scale
down to cover lower bitrates as well, for which it employs linear predictive
coding (LPC) module as its first autoencoder. The hybrid design integrates LPC
and NWC by redefining LPC's quantization as a differentiable process, making
the system training an end-to-end manner. The decoder of proposed system is
with either one NWC (0.12 million parameters) in low to medium bitrate ranges
(12 to 20 kbps) or two NWCs in the high bitrate (32 kbps). Although the
decoding complexity is not yet as low as that of conventional speech codecs, it
is significantly reduced from that of other neural speech coders, such as a
WaveNet-based vocoder. For wide-band speech coding quality, our system yields
comparable or superior performance to AMR-WB and Opus on TIMIT test utterances
at low and medium bitrates. The proposed system can scale up to higher bitrates
to achieve near transparent performance.

neural network (DNN) to predict the solutions of the AC optimal power flow
(AC-OPF) once presented load demands. As network topologies may change,
training this DNN in a sample-efficient manner becomes a necessity. To improve
data efficiency, this work utilizes the fact OPF data are not simple training
labels, but constitute the solutions of a parametric optimization problem. We
thus advocate training a sensitivity-informed DNN (SI-DNN) to match not only
the OPF optimizers, but also their partial derivatives with respect to the OPF
parameters (loads). It is shown that the required Jacobian matrices do exist
under mild conditions, and can be readily computed from the related primal/dual
solutions. The proposed SI-DNN is compatible with a broad range of OPF solvers,
including a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), its
semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation, and MATPOWER; while SI-DNN can be
seamlessly integrated in other learning-to-OPF schemes. Numerical tests on
three benchmark power systems corroborate the advanced generalization and
constraint satisfaction capabilities for the OPF solutions predicted by an
SI-DNN over a conventionally trained DNN, especially in low-data setups.

Specifically, we examine whether complexity properties of a production class
can be used as predictors of the presence of test smells in the associated unit
test. Our results, derived from the analysis of 975 production class-unit test

their associated unit tests. The Lack of Cohesion of Methods in a production

smells. Perhaps more importantly, all three metrics appear to be good
indicators of particular test smells, especially Eager Test and Duplicated

to be significantly related to the incidence of test smells. The results have
important implications for large-scale software development, particularly in a

conventional OUC architecture, composed of 2 $\times$ 2 Mach-Zehnder

scalability is studied by considering a generalized OUC configuration. As a
result, we reveal that the number of coupled modes in each stage plays an
essential role in determining the sensitivity of the entire OUC. The maximal
robustness is attained when all-to-all-coupled interferometers are employed,

propose to predict SA during the takeover transition period in conditionally

ensemble machine learning model, named LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting
Machine), was used to predict SA. Second, in order to understand what factors
influenced SA and how, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values of
individual predictor variables in the LightGBM model were calculated. These
SHAP values explained the prediction model by identifying the most important
factors and their effects on SA, which further improved the model performance
of LightGBM through feature selection. We standardized SA between 0 and 1 by
aggregating three performance measures (i.e., placement, distance, and speed
estimation of vehicles with regard to the ego-vehicle) of SA in recreating
simulated driving scenarios, after 33 participants viewed 32 videos with six

accurate calibration among multimodal sensor, specifically LiDAR-Camera pairs.

specific calibration targets or hardware assistants, and the entire processing

systems. Adversarial training can significantly enhance the robustness of
neural network models by suppressing the non-robust features. However, the
models often suffer from significant accuracy loss on clean data. Ensemble
training methods have emerged as promising solutions for defending against
adversarial attacks by diversifying the vulnerabilities among the sub-models,
simultaneously maintaining comparable accuracy as standard training. However,
existing ensemble methods are with poor scalability, owing to the rapid
complexity increase when including more sub-models in the ensemble. Moreover,
in real-world applications, it is difficult to deploy an ensemble with multiple
sub-models, owing to the tight hardware resource budget and latency
requirement. In this work, we propose ensemble-in-one (EIO), a simple but
efficient way to train an ensemble within one random gated network (RGN). EIO
augments the original model by replacing the parameterized layers with
multi-path random gated blocks (RGBs) to construct a RGN. By diversifying the
vulnerability of the numerous paths within the RGN, better robustness can be
achieved. It provides high scalability because the paths within an EIO network
exponentially increase with the network depth. Our experiments demonstrate that
EIO consistently outperforms previous ensemble training methods with even less
computational overhead.

the toroidal geometry has the additional advantage that the magnetic flux is
weak everywhere except within the bore of the LGR and in the space directly

having each robot learn an unsupervised semantic scene model online and use a

allowing fluid to pass easily in one direction but providing high resistance in
reverse. Here we use experimental tests of Tesla's diode to illustrate
principles of the electronic-hydraulic analogy. We design and construct a
differential pressure chamber (akin to a battery) that is used to measure flow
rate (current) and thus resistance of a given pipe or channel (circuit
element). Our results prove the validity of Tesla's device, whose anisotropic
resistance derives from its asymmetric internal geometry interacting with
high-inertia flows, as quantified by the Reynolds number (here, Re ~ 1e3).
Through the design and testing of new fluidic diodes, we explore the
limitations of the analogy and the challenges of shape optimization in fluid
mechanics. We also provide materials that may be incorporated into lesson plans
for fluid dynamics courses, laboratory modules and further research projects.

systematically activating muscle fibers embedded in the stomach. Following
this, for the first time, we simulate gravity driven bolus emptying into the

and Cosmic Explorer, will detect a bunch of gravitational-wave (GW) signals
originating from the coalescence of binary neutron star (BNS) and binary black
hole (BBH) systems out to the higher redshifts, $z\sim 5-10$. There is a
potential concern that some of the GW signals detected at a high statistical
significance eventually overlap with each other, and the parameter estimation
of such an overlapping system can differ from the one expected from a single
event. Also, there are certainly overlapping systems in which one of the
overlapping events has a low signal-to-noise ratio $\lesssim 4$, and is thus
unable to be clearly detected. Those system will potentially be misidentified
with a single GW event, and the estimated parameters of binary GWs can be
biased. We estimate the occurrence rate of those overlapping events. We find
that the numbers of overlapping events are $\sim 200$ per day for BNSs and a
few per hour for BBHs. Then we study the statistical impacts of these
overlapping GWs on a parameter estimation based on the Fisher matrix analysis.
Our finding is that the overlapping signals produce neither large statistical
errors nor serious systematic biases on the parameters of binary systems,
unless the coalescence time and the redshifted chirp masses of the two
overlapping GWs are very close to each other, i.e.,
$|\mathcal{M}_{z1}-\mathcal{M}_{z2}|\lesssim10^{-4} \,(10^{-1})\,M_\odot$ and
$|t_{\rm c1}-t_{\rm c2}|\lesssim10^{-2}\,(10^{-1})$\,s for BNSs (BBHs). The
occurrence rate of such a closely overlapping event is shown to be much smaller

The SLDO is developed within a framework of feedback-error learning scheme in
which a conventional estimation law and a T2NFS work in parallel. In this
scheme, the latter learns uncertainties and becomes the leading estimator
whereas the former provides the learning error to the T2NFS for learning system
dynamics. A learning algorithm established on SMC theory is derived for an
interval type-2 fuzzy logic system. In addition to the stability of the
learning algorithm, the stability of the SLDO and the stability of the overall
system are proven in the presence of time-varying disturbances. Thanks to
learning process by the T2NFS, the simulation results show that the SLDO is
able to estimate time-varying disturbances precisely as distinct from the basic
nonlinear disturbance observer (BNDO) so that the controller based on the SLDO
ensures robust control performance for systems with time-varying uncertainties,
and maintains nominal performance in the absence of uncertainties.

improve the localization performance, the key semantic edge alignment is
formulated as an optimization problem based on initial poses predicted by an

To address these shortcomings, we present MO3TR: a truly end-to-end
Transformer-based online multi-object tracking (MOT) framework that learns to
handle occlusions, track initiation and termination without the need for an
explicit data association module or any heuristics. MO3TR encodes object
interactions into long-term temporal embeddings using a combination of spatial
and temporal Transformers, and recursively uses the information jointly with
the input data to estimate the states of all tracked objects over time. The
spatial attention mechanism enables our framework to learn implicit
representations between all the objects and the objects to the measurements,
while the temporal attention mechanism focuses on specific parts of past
information, allowing our approach to resolve occlusions over multiple frames.
Our experiments demonstrate the potential of this new approach, achieving
results on par with or better than the current state-of-the-art on multiple MOT

significantly affect performance and control complexity. Passive dynamics can
be designed with good regions of attraction or limit cycles for a specific

control. This paper takes an information perspective: the robot dynamics should
reduce the amount of information required for a controller to achieve a
threshold of performance in a range of tasks. Towards this goal, an iterative
method is proposed to minimize the directed information from state to control
on discrete-time nonlinear systems. iLQG is used to find a controller and value
of information, then the design parameters of the dynamics (e.g. stiffness of
end-effector or joint) are optimized to reduce directed information while
maintaining a minimum bound on performance. The approach is validated in
simulation, on a two-mass system in contact with an uncertain wall position and
a high-DOF door opening task, and shown to improve noise robustness and reduce
time variance of control gains.

whose quantification prefix fits a particular template. We propose an
alternative constructive approach that does not prescribe, a priori, a specific
quantifier prefix. Instead, the required prefix is automatically inferred
without any search by carefully analyzing the structural symmetries of the
protocol. The key insight underlying this approach is that symmetry and
quantification are closely related concepts that express protocol invariance
under different re-arrangements of its components. We propose symmetric
incremental induction, an extension of the finite-domain IC3/PDR algorithm,
that automatically derives the required quantified inductive invariant by
exploiting the connection between symmetry and quantification. While various
attempts have been made to exploit symmetry in verification applications, to
our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a direct link between
symmetry and quantification in the context of clause learning during
incremental induction. We also describe a procedure to automatically find a
minimal finite size, the cutoff, that yields a quantified invariant proving
safety for any size.

restricted practicability owing to unsurmountable compromise on universality,
effectiveness, or efficiency. In this work, we propose a more practical
approach, Lightweight Bayesian Refinement (LiBRe), in the spirit of leveraging
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) for adversarial detection. Empowered by the
task and attack agnostic modeling under Bayes principle, LiBRe can endow a
variety of pre-trained task-dependent DNNs with the ability of defending
heterogeneous adversarial attacks at a low cost. We develop and integrate
advanced learning techniques to make LiBRe appropriate for adversarial
detection. Concretely, we build the few-layer deep ensemble variational and
adopt the pre-training & fine-tuning workflow to boost the effectiveness and
efficiency of LiBRe. We further provide a novel insight to realise adversarial
detection-oriented uncertainty quantification without inefficiently crafting
adversarial examples during training. Extensive empirical studies covering a
wide range of scenarios verify the practicability of LiBRe. We also conduct
thorough ablation studies to evidence the superiority of our modeling and
learning strategies.

destructive power by rapidly amplifying its volume, mobility and impact energy.
Mobility is directly linked to the threat posed by an erosive landslide. No
clear-cut mechanical condition has been presented so far for when, how and how
much energy the erosive landslide gains or loses, resulting in enhanced or
reduced mobility. We pioneer a mechanical model for the energy budget of an
erosive landslide that controls its mobility. A fundamentally new understanding
is that the increased inertia due to the increased mass is related to an
entrainment velocity. With this, the true inertia of an erosive landslide can
be ascertained, making a breakthrough in correctly determining the mobility of
the erosive landslide. Outstandingly, erosion velocity regulates the energy
budget and decides whether the landslide mobility will be enhanced or reduced.
This provides the first-ever explicit mechanical quantification of the state of
erosional energy and a precise description of mobility. This addresses the
long-standing question of why many erosive landslides generate higher mobility,
while others reduce mobility. By introducing three key concepts:
erosion-velocity, entrainment-velocity and energy-velocity, we demonstrate that
erosion and entrainment are essentially different processes. Landslides gain
energy and enhance mobility if the erosion velocity is greater than the
entrainment velocity. We introduce two dimensionless numbers, mobility scaling
and erosion number, delivering explicit measure of mobility. We establish a
mechanism of landslide-propulsion providing the erosion-thrust to the
landslide. Analytically obtained velocity indicates that erosion controls the
landslide dynamics. We also present a full set of dynamical equations in
conservative form which correctly includes the erosion induced net momentum
production.

attention in the recent years. The main challenge for this task is the lack of
labeled data. Existing works circumvent this problem with pseudo labels
generated from data of other easily accessible domains such as synthetic data.
However, these pseudo labels are noisy even with consistency check or
confidence-based filtering due to the domain shift in the data. To solve this
problem, we design a multi-scale domain adaptation module (MDAM) to reduce the
domain gap between the synthetic and real data. We further introduce an online
coarse-to-fine pseudo label updating strategy. Specifically, we propose a
self-distillation module in an inner coarse-update loop and a mean-teacher in
an outer fine-update loop to generate new pseudo labels that gradually replace
the old ones. Consequently, our model is able to learn from the old pseudo
labels at the early stage, and gradually switch to the new pseudo labels to
prevent overfitting in the later stage. We evaluate our approach on the TigDog
and VisDA 2019 datasets, where we outperform existing approaches by a large
margin. We also demonstrate the generalization ability of our model by testing
extensively on both unseen domains and unseen animal categories. Our code is

There is an ever-increasing demand for broad applications and higher
resolutions of videos and cameras in smart homes and smart cities, such as in

networks of visual sensors for various machine vision applications, it needs to
be compressed and securely transmitted over the Internet. H.266/VVC, as the new
compression standard, brings the highest compression for visual data. To
provide security along with high compression, a selective encryption method for
hiding information of videos is presented for this new compression standard.
Selective encryption methods can lower the computation overhead of the
encryption while keeping the video bitstream format which is useful when the
video goes into untrusted blocks such as transcoding or watermarking. Syntax
elements that represent considerable information are selected for the
encryption, i.e., luma Intra Prediction Modes (IPMs), Motion Vector Difference

show that the encrypted videos provide higher visual security compared to other
similar works in previous standards, and integration of the presented

efficiency (results in 2% to 3% bit rate increase).

improves the performance of each network. However, the performance of ensembles
of networks that have undergone mutual learning does not improve significantly

performance of each network has improved significantly. This may be due to the
relationship between the knowledge in mutual learning and the individuality of
the networks in the ensemble. In this study, we propose an ensemble method
using knowledge transfer to improve the accuracy of ensembles by introducing a
loss design that promotes diversity among networks in mutual learning. We use
an attention map as knowledge, which represents the probability distribution
and information in the middle layer of a network. There are many ways to
combine networks and loss designs for knowledge transfer methods. Therefore, we
use the automatic optimization of knowledge-transfer graphs to consider a
variety of knowledge-transfer methods by graphically representing conventional
mutual-learning and distillation methods and optimizing each element through
hyperparameter search. The proposed method consists of a mechanism for
constructing an ensemble in a knowledge-transfer graph, attention loss, and a
loss design that promotes diversity among networks. We explore optimal ensemble
learning by optimizing a knowledge-transfer graph to maximize ensemble
accuracy. From exploration of graphs and evaluation experiments using the
datasets of Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars, and CUB-200-2011, we confirm that the

invertible neural networks with coupling layers. Our Long Short-Term Memory
Video Rescaling Network (LSTM-VRN) leverages temporal information in the
low-resolution video to form an explicit prediction of the missing

upscaling a group of video frames simultaneously. Not only do they outperform
the image-based invertible model in terms of quantitative and qualitative
results, but also show much improved upscaling quality than the video rescaling
methods without joint optimization. To our best knowledge, this work is the

given image category labels but requires to learn object localization models.
Optimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification tends to
activate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent,
causing the partial activation issue. In this paper, we argue that partial
activation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the
convolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty
to capture long-range feature dependency among pixels. We introduce the token
semantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM) to take full advantage of the
self-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency
extraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for
spatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency
to avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related
semantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object
categories. TS-CAM finally couples the patch tokens with the semantic-agnostic
attention map to achieve semantic-aware localization. Experiments on the
ILSVRC/CUB-200-2011 datasets show that TS-CAM outperforms its CNN-CAM
counterparts by 7.1%/27.1% for WSOL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Specifically, massive (large-scale) multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)
systems have received increasing attention due to high angular resolution. This
paper presents an indoor localization testbed based on a massive MIMO
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which supports
physical-layer channel measurements. Instead of exploiting channel state
information (CSI) directly for localization, we focus on positioning from the
perspective of multipath components (MPCs), which are extracted from the CSI
through the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)
algorithm. On top of the available MPCs, we propose a generalized
fingerprinting system based on different single-metric and hybrid-metric
schemes. We evaluate the impact of the varying antenna topologies, the size of
the training set, the number of antennas, and the effective signal-to-noise

method can achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy with a relatively
small training set. Specifically, the distributed uniform linear array obtains
the highest accuracy with about 1.63-2.5-cm mean absolute errors resulting from
the high spatial resolution.

been proposed to capture user-item interactions from implicit feedback, but
existing methods only represent users and items in a single metric space,
ignoring the fact that users can have multiple preferences and items can have
multiple properties, which leads to potential conflicts limiting their
performance in recommendation. To capture the multiple facets of user

propose the novel framework of Multi-fAcet Recommender networks with Spherical

project users and items into multiple metric spaces for fine-grained
representation learning, and compare them only in the proper spaces.
Furthermore, we devise a spherical optimization strategy to enhance the

spreading are classical techniques for semi-supervised learning in the graph

However, these methods are linear models, and do not offer an obvious way of
incorporating node features for making predictions. Here, we develop a
nonlinear diffusion process on hypergraphs that spreads both features and
labels following the hypergraph structure, which can be interpreted as a
hypergraph equilibrium network. Even though the process is nonlinear, we show
global convergence to a unique limiting point for a broad class of
nonlinearities, which is the global optimum of a interpretable, regularized
semi-supervised learning loss function. The limiting point serves as a node
embedding from which we make predictions with a linear model. Our approach is
much more accurate than several hypergraph neural networks, and also takes less

occurs in hierarchical classification. Under KD the vocabulary of concepts,
their individual distributions, and the is-a relations between them can all
change over time. The main challenge is that, since the ground-truth concept
hierarchy is unobserved, it is hard to tell apart different forms of KD. For
instance, introducing a new is-a relation between two concepts might be
confused with individual changes to those concepts, but it is far from
equivalent. Failure to identify the right kind of KD compromises the concept
hierarchy used by the classifier, leading to systematic prediction errors. Our
key observation is that in many human-in-the-loop applications (like smart
personal assistants) the user knows whether and what kind of drift occurred
recently. Motivated by this, we introduce TRCKD, a novel approach that combines
automated drift detection and adaptation with an interactive stage in which the

statistical methods, suitable for modeling large areas, to purely deterministic
ones, usually easier to use in local analyses. A common requirement is the need
to locate potential detachment points, often found uphill on cliffs, and the
subsequent assessment of the runout areas of rockfalls stemming from such
points. Here, we apply a physically based model to calculate rockfall
trajectories along the whole Italian railway network, within a corridor of
total length of about 17,000 km and varying width. We propose a data-driven
method for the location of rockfall source points based on expert mapping of
potential source areas on sample representative locations. Using empirical
distributions of gridded slope values in source areas mapped by experts, we
derived probabilistic maps of rockfall sources in the proximity of the railway
network, regardless of a particular trigger. Source areas act as starting
points of simulated trajectories in the three-dimensional model STONE. The
program provides a pixel-by-pixel trajectory count, covering 24,500 km2, the
largest homogeneous application of the model to date. We classified the map
into a vector susceptibility map of the segments of the railway, for which we
provide segment-wise rockfall susceptibility. Eventually, we considered a graph
representation of the network to classify the segments both on the basis of
rockfall susceptibility and the role of each segment in the network, resulting
in a network-ranked susceptibility. Both maps are useful for subsequent hazard
assessment, and to prioritize safety improvements along the railway, at
national scale.

previous approaches that require pixel-aligned masks, our framework can
synthesize high-quality images from not only dense semantic masks but also
sparse inputs such as landmarks and scribbles. Qualitative and quantitative

motivated by the Matroid Partition Theorem by Edmonds and Fulkerson. A packing
for a family $ (M_i: i\in\Theta) $ of matroids on the common edge set $ E $ is
a system $ (S_i: i\in\Theta ) $ of pairwise disjoint subsets of $ E $ where $
S_i $ is panning in $ M_i $. Similarly, a covering is a system $ (I_i:
i\in\Theta ) $ with $\bigcup_{i\in\Theta} I_i=E $ where $ I_i $ is independent
in $ M_i $. The conjecture states that for every matroid family on $ E $ there
is a partition $E=E_p \sqcup E_c$ such that $ (M_i \upharpoonright E_p: i\in
\Theta) $ admits a packing and $ (M_i. E_c: i\in \Theta) $ admits a covering.
We prove the special case where $ E $ is countable and each $ M_i $ is either
finitary or cofinitary. The connection between packing/covering and matroid
intersection problems discovered by Bowler and Carmesin can be established for
every well-behaved matroid class. This makes possible to approach the problem
from the direction of matroid intersection. We show that the generalized
version of Nash-Williams' Matroid Intersection Conjecture holds for countable
matroids having only finitary and cofinitary components.

itself rotates around another direction. In a precessing cylinder full of
fluid, a steady and axisymmetric component of the azimuthal flow is generally
present. This component is called a zonal flow. Although zonal flows have been
often observed in experiments and numerical simulations, their origin has
eluded theoretical approaches so far. Here, we develop an asymptotic analysis
to calculate the zonal flow forced in a resonant precessing cylinder, that is
when the harmonic response is dominated by a single Kelvin mode. We find that
the zonal flow originates from three different sources: (1) the nonlinear
interaction of the inviscid Kelvin mode with its viscous correction; (2) the
steady and axisymmetric response to the nonlinear interaction of the Kelvin
mode with itself; and (3) the nonlinear interactions in the end boundary
layers. In a precessing cylinder, two additional sources arise due to the
equatorial Coriolis force and the forced shear flow. However, they cancel
exactly. The study thus generalises to any Kelvin mode, forced by precession or
any other mechanism. The present theoretical predictions of the zonal flow are
confirmed by comparison with numerical simulations and experimental results. We
also show numerically that the zonal flow is always retrograde in a resonant
precessing cylinder (m=1) or when it results from resonant Kelvin modes of
azimuthal wavenumbers m=2, 3, and presumably higher.

schemes for the solution of the full Boltzmann equation. The velocity space is
approximated by using a discrete ordinate approach while the collisional
integral is solved by spectral methods. The space reconstruction is realized by
integrating the distribution function, describing the state of the system, over
arbitrary shaped and closed control volumes using a Central Weighted ENO
(CWENO) technique. Compared to other reconstruction methods, this approach
permits to keep compact stencil sizes which is a remarkable property in the
context of kinetic equations due to the considerable demand of computational
resources. The full discretization is then obtained by combining the previous
phase-space approximation with high order Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge Kutta
schemes. These methods guarantee stability, accuracy and preservation of the
asymptotic state. Comparisons of the Boltzmann model with simpler relaxation
type kinetic models (like BGK) is proposed showing the capability of the
Boltzmann equation to capture different physical solutions. The theoretical
order of convergence is numerically measured in different regimes and the
methods are tested on several standard two-dimensional benchmark problems in

However, due to their complex structure they are rather difficult to

results on image classification compared to convolutional neural networks.
Inspired by this, in this paper, we study how to learn multi-scale feature
representations in transformer models for image classification. To this end, we
propose a dual-branch transformer to combine image patches (i.e., tokens in a
transformer) of different sizes to produce stronger image features. Our
approach processes small-patch and large-patch tokens with two separate
branches of different computational complexity and these tokens are then fused
purely by attention multiple times to complement each other. Furthermore, to
reduce computation, we develop a simple yet effective token fusion module based
on cross attention, which uses a single token for each branch as a query to
exchange information with other branches. Our proposed cross-attention only
requires linear time for both computational and memory complexity instead of
quadratic time otherwise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
performs better than or on par with several concurrent works on vision
transformer, in addition to efficient CNN models. For example, on the
ImageNet1K dataset, with some architectural changes, our approach outperforms
the recent DeiT by a large margin of 2\% with a small to moderate increase in

However, establishing the relation between their internal architecture, which

upon interfacial confinement, which define the monolayer's properties, remains
an elusive task. Here, we propose a comprehensive study elucidating this
relation for a system of microgels with tunable architecture. We synthesize
core-shell microgels, whose soft core can be chemically degraded in a
controlled fashion, yielding particles ranging from analogues of standard
batch-synthesized to completely hollow microgels after total core removal. We
characterize the internal structure of these particles, their swelling
properties in bulk and their morphologies upon adsorption at an oil-water
interface via a combination of numerical simulations and complementary
experiments. In particular, we confirm that hollow microgels are mechanically
stable in bulk aqueous conditions and that the progressive removal of the core
leads to a significant flattening of the microgels, which become disk-like
particles, at the interface. At low compression, the mechanical response of the
monolayer is dominated by the presence of loosely crosslinked polymers forming
a corona surrounding the particle within the interfacial plane, regardless of
the presence of a core. By contrast, at high compression, the absence of a core
enables the particles to deform in the direction orthogonal to the interface.
These findings shed new light on which structural features of soft particles
determine their interfacial behaviour, enabling new design strategies for
tailored materials.

relativistic magnetic reconnection via combined particle-in-cell (PIC) and
polarized radiation transfer simulations. We find that although the intrinsic
optical and X-ray polarization degrees are similar on average, the X-ray
polarization is much more variable in both polarization degree and angle (PD
and PA). Given the sensitivity of the {\it IXPE}, it may obtain one to a few
polarization data points for one flaring event of nearby bright HBLs Mrk~421
and 501. However, it may not fully resolve the highly variable X-ray
polarization. Due to the temporal depolarization, where the integration of
photons with variable polarization states over a finite period of time can
lower the detected PD, the measured X-ray PD can be considerably lower than the
optical counterpart or even undetectable. The lower X-ray PD than the optical
thus can be a characteristic signature of relativistic magnetic reconnection.
For very bright flares where the X-ray polarization is well resolved,
relativistic magnetic reconnection predicts smooth X-ray PA swings, which
originate from large plasmoid mergers in the reconnection region.

because of the irregular and uncoordinated memory accesses in processing FPPs.
  In this paper, we propose ForkGraph, a cache-efficient FPP processing system
on multi-core architectures. To improve the cache reuse, we divide the graph
into partitions each sized of LLC capacity, and the queries in an FPP are
buffered and executed on the partition basis. We further develop efficient
intra- and inter-partition execution strategies for efficiency. For
intra-partition processing, since the graph partition fits into LLC, we propose
to execute each graph query with efficient sequential algorithms (in contrast
with parallel algorithms in existing parallel graph processing systems) and
present an atomic-free query processing by consolidating contending operations
to cache-resident graph partition. For inter-partition processing, we propose
yielding and priority-based scheduling, to reduce redundant work in processing.
Besides, we theoretically prove that ForkGraph performs the same amount of
work, to within a constant factor, as the fastest known sequential algorithms

significant importance for improving the estimation of flow characteristics by
incorporating limited observations. Existing works mainly focus on using only
one observation data source, e.g., velocity, wall pressure, lift or drag force,
to reconstruct the flow. In practical applications observations are disparate
data sources that often vary in dimension and quality. Simultaneously
incorporating these disparate data is worth investigation to improve the flow
reconstruction. In this work, we investigate the disparate data assimilation
with ensemble methods to enhance the reconstruction of turbulent mean flows.
Specifically, a regularized ensemble Kalman method is employed to incorporate
the observation of velocity and different sources of wall quantities (e.g.,
wall shear stress, wall pressure distribution, lift and drag force). Three
numerical examples are used to demonstrate the capability of the proposed
framework for assimilating disparate observation data. The first two cases,
i.e., a one-dimensional planar channel flow and a two-dimensional transitional
flow over plate, are used to incorporate both the sparse velocity and wall
friction. In the third case of the flow over periodic hills, the wall pressure
distribution and the lift and drag force are regarded as observation in
addition to velocity, to recover the flow fields. The results demonstrate the
merits of incorporating various disparate data sources to improve the accuracy
of the flow-field estimation. The ensemble-based method can assimilate
disparate data non-intrusively and robustly without requiring significant
changes to the model simulation codes. The method demonstrated here opens up
possibilities for assimilating realistic experimental data, which are often
disparate.

Given their potential importance in maintaining low level of star formation at

observations with the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) at the Keck
telescope of two red geysers (z$<$0.1) using multiple long slit positions to
sample different regions of each galaxy. Our ESI data with a spectral
resolution (R) $\sim$ 8000 improves upon MaNGA's resolution by a factor of
four, allowing us to resolve the ionized gas velocity profiles along the
putative wind cone with an instrumental resolution of $\rm \sigma =
16~km~s^{-1}$. The line profiles of H$\alpha$ and [NII]$\rm \lambda 6584$ show
asymmetric shapes that depend systematically on location $-$ extended blue
wings on the red-shifted side of the galaxy and red wings on the opposite side.
We construct a simple wind model and show that our results are consistent with
geometric projections through an outflowing conical wind oriented at an angle
towards the line of sight. An alternative hypothesis that assigns the
asymmetric pattern to ""beam-smearing"" of a rotating, ionized gas disk does a
poor job matching the line asymmetry profiles. While our study features just
two sources, it lends further support to the notion that red geysers are the
result of galaxy-scale winds.

contrary to that known for blazars. However, only about a dozen $\gamma$-ray
detected NLS1s ($\gamma$-NLS1s) are known to date and all of them are at
$z\le1$. Here, we report the identification of a new $\gamma$-ray emitting NLS1
TXS 1206+549 at $z=1.344$. A near-infrared spectrum taken with the Subaru
telescope showed H$\beta$ emission line with FWHM of $1194\pm77$ km s$^{-1}$
and weak [O III] emission line but no optical Fe II lines, due to the limited
wavelength coverage and poor signal-to-noise ratio. However, UV Fe II lines are
present in the SDSS optical spectrum. The source is very radio-loud,
unresolved, and has a flat radio spectrum. The broadband SED of the source has
the typical two hump structure shown by blazars and other $\gamma$-NLS1s. The
source exhibits strong variability at all wavelengths such as the optical,
infrared, and $\gamma$-ray bands. All these observed characteristics show that
TXS 1206+549 is the most distant $\gamma$-NLS1 known to date.

necessary for developing scalable quantum information processors. Materials
innovation and design breakthroughs have increased functionality and coherence
of qubits substantially over the past two decades. Here we show by improving
interface between InAs as a semiconductor and Al as a superconductor, one can
reliably fabricate voltage-controlled Josephson junction field effect
transistor (JJ-FET) that can be used as tunable qubits, resonators, and coupler
switches. We find that band gap engineering is crucial in realizing a
two-dimensional electron gas near the surface. In addition, we show how the
coupling between the semiconductor layer and the superconducting contacts can
affect qubit properties. We present the anharmonicity and coupling strengths
from one and two-photon absorption in a quantum two level system fabricated
with a JJ-FET.

Robert Moses's dictatorial tenure as the ""master builder"" of mid-century New
York. Moses profoundly transformed New York's urban fabric and transportation
system, producing the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge,
the Westside Highway, the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the Lincoln Center, the UN
headquarters, Shea Stadium, Jones Beach State Park and many other projects.
However, The Power Broker did lasting damage to his public image and today he
remains one of the most controversial figures in city planning history. On
August 26, 1974, Moses issued a turgid 23-page statement denouncing Caro's work
as ""full of mistakes, unsupported charges, nasty baseless personalities, and
random haymakers."" Moses's original typewritten statement survives today as a
grainy photocopy in the New York City Parks Department archive. To better
preserve and disseminate it, I have extracted and transcribed its text using
optical character recognition and edited the result to correct errors. Here I
compile my transcription of Moses's statement, alongside Caro's reply to it.

recent years. However, these works consider mostly the computation resources
located at the cloud centers and wireless access nodes, ignoring the
possibility of utilizing server-empowered relays to improve the performance. In
this paper, we study stochastic relay-assisted MEC in systems with discrete
transmission time-line and block fading wireless channels. In order to clearly
identify and inspect the fundamental affecting factors, we investigate the
building block of this architecture, namely a hierarchical network consisting
of a source, a buffer-and-server-aided relay and another higher-level computing
node. We provide a framework to take into account the effects of the fading
channels, the task arrival dynamics as well as the queuing delays in both the
transmission and computation buffers, which facilitates the derivation of the
expression for the Average Response Time (ART). Based on that and the system
average power consumption in each slot, we introduce the concept of Average
Response Energy (ARE) as a novel metric to capture the energy efficiency in MEC
while considering the stochastic nature of the system parameters. Accordingly,
we propose two offloading schemes with their respective problem formulations,
namely the Minimum ART (MART) and the Minimum ARE (MARE) schemes, to optimize
the transmission power and task assignment probability while keeping the system
queues stable. We demonstrate the difference of the formulated problems with
the relevant problem in a recent work, analyze the properties of the problems
and noting them, we propose effective solution methods. Using extensive
simulations, we validate the presented analysis and show the effectiveness of
the proposed schemes in comparison with various baseline methods adapting
existing approaches.

  Induced by the R Vector Characteristic of the Ring of Hybrid Numbers Z","133 pp. 6th Version. Portuguese (BR)",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This essay summarizes the efforts required to build a program of a unified,
low-dimension topology that allows characterizing all these flat space-times.
Since spatiotemporal manifolds are topological spaces equipped with metrics,
their properties are characterized by Clifford algebras in hypercomplex rings
associative with unity, so that Galileo's transformations are induced by a dual
number; the Lorentz transformations, by a perplexed number and the Euclid
transformations, by a complex number. This fact led us to establish an internal
automorphism in the ring of hybrid numbers that acts as a map of the manifolds
and induces the space-time metric based on the quality (characteristic) of the
associated hypercomplex unit. From this automorphism, we built hybrid
trigonometric functions, which we call Poincar\'e functions, which allowed us
to deduce general properties of space-time, hyperbolic, parabolic and
elliptical geometries and the groups SO (3), SO (4) and SO (1, 3). This
approach allows us to highlight the global properties of space-time, suggests
methods for geodynamic models and allows us to interpret anti-matter as matter
in a Euclidean space-time where the nature of time is imaginary.
