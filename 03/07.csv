violations of common coding standards. Our research set out to discover the
most prevalent code smells in ML projects. We gathered a dataset of 74
open-source ML projects, installed their dependencies and ran Pylint on them.
This resulted in a top 20 of all detected code smells, per category. Manual
analysis of these smells mainly showed that code duplication is widespread and
that the PEP8 convention for identifier naming style may not always be
applicable to ML code due to its resemblance with mathematical notation. More
interestingly, however, we found several major obstructions to the
maintainability and reproducibility of ML projects, primarily related to the
dependency management of Python projects. We also found that Pylint cannot
reliably check for correct usage of imported dependencies, including prominent

difficulty in dealing with motion prediction, occlusion handling, and object
re-identification. Many recent algorithms use motion and appearance cues to
overcome these challenges. But using appearance cues increases the computation
cost notably and therefore the speed of the algorithm decreases significantly
which makes them inappropriate for online applications. In contrast, there are
algorithms that only use motion cues to increase speed, especially for online
applications. But these algorithms cannot handle occlusions and re-identify
lost objects. In this paper, a novel online multiple object tracking algorithm
is presented that only uses geometric cues of objects to tackle the occlusion
and reidentification challenges simultaneously. As a result, it decreases the
identity switch and fragmentation metrics. Experimental results show that the
proposed algorithm could decrease identity switch by 40% and fragmentation by
28% compared to the state of the art online tracking algorithms. The code is
also publicly available.

Therefore, understanding and modeling their dynamics is crucially important.
Although their dynamics over various types of geometries are well-studied in

an open problem in this setting. With this motivation, in this paper, we derive
the exact analytical solutions of the long-wave equation over nonlinear depth

need to be orchestrated. Furthermore, these systems may belong to different
entities and competition may exist between them. Nash equilibrium is most
commonly used for coordination of such entities however the convergence and
existence of Nash equilibrium can not always be guaranteed. To this end, we use

this paper a distributionally robust optimization formulation to generate a
task assignment plan that promotes the fairness in allocation, attained by
reducing the difference in the total working time among workers, under
uncertain service time. The proposed joint chance constraint model is
conservatively approximated by a worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk, and we
devise a sequential algorithm to solve the finite-dimensional reformulations
which are linear (mixed-binary) optimization problems. We also provide explicit

we first observe that the ability to train larger video prediction models is

hierarchical latent variable models can produce higher quality predictions by
capturing the multi-level stochasticity of future observations, but end-to-end

greedy and modular optimization of hierarchical autoencoders can simultaneously
address both the memory constraints and the optimization challenges of
large-scale video prediction. We introduce Greedy Hierarchical Variational

greedily training each level of a hierarchical autoencoder. In comparison to
state-of-the-art models, GHVAEs provide 17-55% gains in prediction performance

can improve performance monotonically by simply adding more modules.

of a quasi-clique agglomerative approach, provide the full details of the
mathematical steps of the AQCM algorithm, and explain some of the motivation
behind the new methodology. The main achievement of the new methodology is that
the agglomerative process now unfolds adaptively according to the inherent
structure unique to a given data set, and this happens without the time-costly
parameter adjustment that drove the previous QCM algorithm. For this reason we
call the new algorithm \emph{automatic}. We provide a demonstration of the
algorithm's performance at the task of community detection in a social media
network of 22,900 nodes.

consistent with the postulates of regularity structures when it comes to the

Aut}(\mathsf{T})$ arises from a Hopf algebra $\mathsf{T}^+$ and a comodule
$\Delta\colon\mathsf{T}\rightarrow \mathsf{T}^+\otimes\mathsf{T}$. In fact,
this approach, where the dual $\mathsf{T}^*$ of the abstract model space
$\mathsf{T}$ naturally embeds into a formal power series algebra, allows to
interpret $\mathsf{G}^*\subset{\rm Aut}(\mathsf{T}^*)$ as a Lie group arising
from a Lie algebra $\mathsf{L} \subset{\rm End}(\mathsf{T}^*)$ consisting of
derivations on this power series algebra. These derivations in turn are the
infinitesimal generators of two actions on the space of pairs (nonlinearities,
functions of space-time mod constants). These actions are shift of space-time
and tilt by space-time polynomials. The Hopf algebra $\mathsf{T}^+$ arises from
a coordinate representation of the universal enveloping algebra ${\rm
U}(\mathsf{L})$ of the Lie algebra $\mathsf{L}$. The coordinates are determined
by an underlying pre-Lie algebra structure of the derived algebra of
$\mathsf{L}$. Strong finiteness properties, which are enforced by gradedness
and the restrictive definition of $\mathsf{T}$, allow for this purely algebraic
construction of $\mathsf{G}$. We also argue that there exist pre-Lie algebra
and Hopf algebra morphisms between our structure and the tree-based one in the
cases of branched rough paths (Grossman-Larson, Connes-Kreimer) and of the
generalized parabolic Anderson model.

design, presently, very few methods are available to measure it at small
(micrometre) scales and those typically involve intensive geometric refinement
of the sample. In this work we show how Poisson's ratio may be measured during
nanoindentation experiments by means of a second load actuator oriented
orthogonally to the primary vertical load axis. We apply a small oscillating
lateral load to Berkovich and sphero-conical indenter tips during
nanoindentation into fused silica and metallic samples. This enables the
elastic lateral contact stiffness to be measured as a function of depth in a
manner analogous to continuous stiffness measurements in conventional
indentation experiments. The stiffness may in turn be used to calculate v.
During constant strain rate experiments, we extract values of v = 0.16 for
fused silica and v = 0.34 for polycrystalline aluminium over indentation depths
of several hundred nanometres. We highlight two critical issues that must be
addressed to ensure accurate measurement of v during indentation; partial slip
and additional plasticity brought about through the added shear under
tangential loading. We study these separate phenomena in fused silica and
single crystal nickel, suggesting that interfacial slip is favoured in harder,
brittle materials, while plasticity is dominant in more ductile materials. We
offer some suggestions on how to mitigate these problems based on tip geometry
and loading protocols.

achieve high perceptual quality with acceptable distortion. This is attained by
a stochastic denoiser that samples from the posterior distribution, trained as

perceptual quality, we introduce to the CGAN objective a theoretically founded
penalty term that does not force a distortion requirement on individual
samples, but rather on their mean. We showcase our proposed method with a novel
denoiser architecture that achieves the reformed denoising goal and produces
vivid and diverse outcomes in immoderate noise levels.

density matrix functional embedding theory (Ht-DMFET) preserves, by
construction, the single-particle character of the bath when electron
correlation is introduced. In Ht-DMFET, the projected ""impurity+bath"" cluster's
Hamiltonian (from which approximate local properties of the interacting lattice
can be extracted) becomes an explicit functional of the density matrix. In the
spirit of single-impurity DMET, we consider in this work a closed
(two-electron) cluster constructed from the full-size non-interacting density
matrix. When the (Householder transformed) interaction on the bath site is
taken into account, per-site energies obtained for the half-filled
one-dimensional Hubbard lattice match almost perfectly the exact Bethe Ansatz
results in all correlation regimes. In the strongly correlated regime, the
results deteriorate away from half-filling. This can be related to the electron
number fluctuations in the (two-site) cluster which are not described neither
in Ht-DMFET nor in regular DMET. As expected, the per-site energies
dramatically improve when increasing the number of embedded impurities. Formal
connections with density/density matrix functional theories have been briefly
discussed and should be explored further. Work is currently in progress in this

introduces several new coding tools providing a significant coding gain over

increasing the coding efficiency adds more dependencies in the video bitstream
making format-compliant encryption with the standard more challenging. In this
paper we tackle the problem of selective encryption of the VVC standard in
format-compliant and constant bitrate. These two constraints ensure that the
encrypted bitstream can be decoded by any VVC decoder while the bitrate remains
unchanged by the encryption. The selective encryption of all possible VVC
syntax elements is investigated. A new algorithm is proposed to encrypt in
format-compliant and constant bitrate the transform coefficients (TCs) together
with other syntax elements at the level of the entropy encoder. The proposed
solution was integrated and assessed under the VVC reference software model

decreases the video quality while the encryption is robust against several

conversion via the spin Hall effect. However, this local configuration is prone
to spurious signals. In this work, we address spurious Hall effects that can
contaminate the spin Hall signal in these FM/HM T-shaped nanostructures. The
most pronounced Hall effects in our Co50Fe50/Pt nanostructures are the planar
Hall effect and the anomalous Hall effect generated in the FM nanowire. We find
that the planar Hall effect, induced by misalignment between magnetization and
current direction in the FM wire, is manifested as a shift in the measured
baseline resistance, but does not alter the spin Hall signal. In contrast, the
anomalous Hall effect, arising from the charge current distribution within the
FM, adds to the spin Hall signal. However, the effect can be made insignificant
by minimizing the shunting effect via proper design of the device. We conclude
that local spin injection in FM/HM nanostructures is a suitable tool for
measuring spin Hall signals and, therefore, a valid method for magnetic state

contention resolution in the online random-order model. Specifically, the
matroid secretary conjecture is true if and only if every matroid admits an
online random-order contention resolution scheme which, given an arbitrary
(possibly correlated) prior distribution over subsets of the ground set,
matches the balance ratio of the best offline scheme for that distribution up
to a constant. We refer to such a scheme as universal. Our result indicates
that the core challenge of the matroid secretary problem lies in resolving
contention for positively correlated inputs, in particular when the positive
correlation is benign in as much as offline contention resolution is concerned.
  Our result builds on our previous work which establishes one direction of
this equivalence, namely that the secretary conjecture implies universal
random-order contention resolution, as well as a weak converse, which derives a
matroid secretary algorithm from a random-order contention resolution scheme
with only partial knowledge of the distribution. It is this weak converse that
we strengthen in this paper: We show that universal random-order contention
resolution for matroids, in the usual setting of a fully known prior
distribution, suffices to resolve the matroid secretary conjecture in the
affirmative.
  Our proof is the composition of three reductions. First, we use duality
arguments to reduce the matroid secretary problem to the matroid prophet

increasingly on soft weakly-bonded materials, such methods have become
indispensable. In this perspective, an overview of simulation methods that are
applicable for large system sizes and that can capture the quantum nature of
electrons and nuclei in the adiabatic approximation is given. In addition, the

stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR) consisting of no DR, mild DR, moderate DR,
severe DR, and proliferate DR. This multitask model consists of one
classification model and one regression model, each with its own loss function.
Noting that a higher severity level normally occurs after a lower severity
level, this dependency is taken into consideration by concatenating the
classification and regression models. The regression model learns the
inter-dependency between the stages and outputs a score corresponding to the
severity level of DR generating a higher score for a higher severity level.
After training the regression model and the classification model separately,
the features extracted by these two models are concatenated and inputted to a
multilayer perceptron network to classify the five stages of DR. A modified
Squeeze Excitation Densely Connected deep neural network is developed to
implement this multitasking approach. The developed multitask model is then
used to detect the five stages of DR by examining the two large Kaggle datasets
of APTOS and EyePACS. A multitasking transfer learning model based on Xception

into five stages. It is found that the developed model achieves a weighted

these attacks. In many applications, the choice of features is more important
than the choice of model. A range of studies have, with varying degrees of
success, attempted to discriminate between benign traffic and well-known
cyber-attacks. The features used in these studies are broadly similar and have
demonstrated their effectiveness in situations where cyber-attacks do not
imitate benign behaviour. To overcome this barrier, in this manuscript, we
introduce new features based on a higher level of abstraction of network
traffic. Specifically, we perform flow aggregation by grouping flows with
similarities. This additional level of feature abstraction benefits from
cumulative information, thus qualifying the models to classify cyber-attacks
that mimic benign traffic. The performance of the new features is evaluated
using the benchmark CICIDS2017 dataset, and the results demonstrate their

geometry. Although recent methods have achieved impressive progress in terms of
evaluation metrics such as the pixel-wise relative error, most methods neglect
the geometric constraints in the 3D space. In this work, we show the importance
of the high-order 3D geometric constraints for depth prediction. By designing a
loss term that enforces a simple geometric constraint, namely, virtual normal
directions determined by randomly sampled three points in the reconstructed 3D
space, we significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of monocular depth
estimation. Significantly, the virtual normal loss can not only improve the
performance of learning metric depth, but also disentangle the scale
information and enrich the model with better shape information. Therefore, when
not having access to absolute metric depth training data, we can use virtual
normal to learn a robust affine-invariant depth generated on diverse scenes. In
experiments, We show state-of-the-art results of learning metric depth on NYU
Depth-V2 and KITTI. From the high-quality predicted depth, we are now able to
recover good 3D structures of the scene such as the point cloud and surface
normal directly, eliminating the necessity of relying on additional models as
was previously done. To demonstrate the excellent generalizability of learning
affine-invariant depth on diverse data with the virtual normal loss, we
construct a large-scale and diverse dataset for training affine-invariant

mind. They operated on separate Operational Technology (OT) networks. As these
systems now become more integrated with Information Technology (IT) networks
based on IP, they expose vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attackers
through these IT networks. The attackers can control such systems and cause
behavior that jeopardizes the performance and safety measures that were
originally designed into the system. In this paper, we explore the approaches
to identify threats to CPSs and ensure the quality of the created threat
models. The study involves interviews with eleven security experts working in
security consultation companies, software engineering companies, an Original
Equipment Manufacturer (OEM),and ground and areal vehicles integrators. We
found through these interviews that the practitioners use a combination of
various threat modeling methods, approaches, and standards together when they
perform threat modeling of given CPSs. key challenges practitioners face are:
they cannot transfer the threat modeling knowledge that they acquire in a
cyber-physical domain to other domains, threat models of modified systems are
often not updated, and the reliance on mostly peer-evaluation and quality
checklists to ensure the quality of threat models. The study warns about the
difficulty to develop secure CPSs and calls for research on developing
practical threat modeling methods for CPSs, techniques for continuous threat
modeling, and techniques to ensure the quality of threat models.

semimetals should be governed by the equations of axion electrodynamics. These
equations capture both the chiral magnetic and anomalous Hall effects in the
limit of linear response, while at higher orders their solutions can provide
detectable electromagnetic signatures of the anomaly. In this work, we consider
three versions of axion electrodynamics that have been proposed in the Weyl
semimetal literature. These versions differ in the form of the chiral magnetic

case, we look for solutions to these equations for simple sample geometries

magnetic term generated by a non-dynamical axion, self-consistent solutions can
generally be obtained. In this case, the magnetic field inside of the Weyl
semimetal can be magnified significantly, providing a testable signature for
experiments. Self-consistent solutions can also be obtained for dynamical
axions, but only in cases where the chiral magnetic term vanishes identically.
Finally, for a nonlinear form of the chiral magnetic term frequently considered
in the literature, we find that there are no self-consistent solutions aside

mass of studies for lung infection segmentation from CT images. Though many
methods have been proposed for this issue, it is a challenging task because of
infections of various size appearing in different lobe zones. To tackle these
issues, we propose a Graph-based Pyramid Global Context Reasoning (Graph-PGCR)
module, which is capable of modeling long-range dependencies among disjoint
infections as well as adapt size variation. We first incorporate graph
convolution to exploit long-term contextual information from multiple lobe
zones. Different from previous average pooling or maximum object probability,
we propose a saliency-aware projection mechanism to pick up infection-related
pixels as a set of graph nodes. After graph reasoning, the relation-aware
features are reversed back to the original coordinate space for the down-stream
tasks. We further construct multiple graphs with different sampling rates to
handle the size variation problem. To this end, distinct multi-scale long-range
contextual patterns can be captured. Our Graph-PGCR module is plug-and-play,
which can be integrated into any architecture to improve its performance.
Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method consistently boost the
performance of state-of-the-art backbone architectures on both of public and
our private COVID-19 datasets.

cosmology, which can only accommodate an amplitude < 230 mK. Nevertheless, the
line profile's redshift range (15 < z < 20) suggests a possible link to Pop III
star formation and an implied evolution out of the `dark ages.' Given this
tension with the standard model, we here examine whether the observed 21-cm
signal is instead consistent with the results of recent modeling based on the
alternative Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology known as the R_h=ct
universe, showing that--in this model--the CMB radiation might have been
rethermalized by dust ejected into the IGM by the first-generation stars at
redshift z < 16. We find that the requirements for this process to have
occurred would have self-consistently established an equilibrium spin
temperature T_s~3.4 K in the neutral hydrogen, via the irradiation of the IGM
by deep penetrating X-rays emitted at the termination shocks of Pop III
supernova remnants. Such a dust scenario has been strongly ruled out for the
standard model, so the spin temperature (~3.3 K) inferred from the 21-cm
absorption feature appears to be much more consistent with the R_h=ct profile
than that implied by LCDM, for which adiabatic cooling would have established a
spin temperature T_s(z=17.2)~6 K.

orthogonality regularization to force the two modules to be independent during

another, and avoid collapsing them into a singular point on the manifold.
Through this adversarial training method, the data from the underprivileged

  Theory, Algorithms, and Applications",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that can make
deep learning models more transparent and explainable to a user. Some
researchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve a certain degree of
human-level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally
understandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of
algorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals.
This paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing body
of literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial
intelligence. We performed an LDA topic modelling analysis under a PRISMA
framework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis resulted
in a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed
algorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications in
real-world data. This research suggests that current model-agnostic
counterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal
theoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human
decision-maker. Our findings suggest that the explanations derived from major
algorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than
cause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous or even biased
explanations. This paper also advances the literature with new directions and
challenges on promoting causability in model-agnostic approaches for
explainable artificial intelligence.

mRNA transcript probabilities through its constituent splice junctions' energy

edge of the network, where data is typically generated and collected, by
exploiting multiple devices at the edge collectively. However, exploiting the
potential of edge computing is challenging mainly due to the heterogeneous and
time-varying nature of edge devices. Coded computation, which advocates mixing
data in sub-tasks by employing erasure codes and offloading these sub-tasks to
other devices for computation, is recently gaining interest, thanks to its
higher reliability, smaller delay, and lower communication cost. In this paper,
our focus is on characterizing the cost-benefit trade-offs of coded computation
for practical edge computing systems, and develop an adaptive coded computation
framework. In particular, we focus on matrix multiplication as a
computationally intensive task, and develop an adaptive coding for matrix
multiplication (ACM^2) algorithm by taking into account the heterogeneous and
time varying nature of edge devices. ACM^2 dynamically selects the best coding
policy by taking into account the computing time, storage requirements as well
as successful decoding probability. We show that ACM^2 improves the task
completion delay significantly as compared to existing coded matrix

series of learning-based algorithms have been introduced and show advantages in
speed. Many of them are based on correspondences between the two point clouds,
so they do not rely on transformation initialization. However, these
learning-based methods are sensitive to outliers, which lead to more incorrect
correspondences. In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph matchingbased
framework for point cloud registration. Specifically, we first transform point
clouds into graphs and extract deep features for each point. Then, we develop a
module based on deep graph matching to calculate a soft correspondence matrix.
By using graph matching, not only the local geometry of each point but also its
structure and topology in a larger range are considered in establishing
correspondences, so that more correct correspondences are found. We train the
network with a loss directly defined on the correspondences, and in the test
stage the soft correspondences are transformed into hard one-to-one
correspondences so that registration can be performed by singular value
decomposition. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer-based method to generate
edges for graph construction, which further improves the quality of the
correspondences. Extensive experiments on registering clean, noisy,
partial-to-partial and unseen category point clouds show that the proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be made publicly

student network to receive a mixture of multi-level knowledge from the feature
pyramid under better supervision, thus allowing to detect anomalies of various
sizes. The difference between feature pyramids generated by the two networks
serves as a scoring function indicating the probability of anomaly occurring.
Due to such operations, our approach achieves accurate and fast pixel-level

backdoor attacks, where the classifier is manipulated such that it
misclassifies any input containing an attacker-determined Trojan trigger.
Backdoors compromise a model's integrity, thereby posing a severe threat to the
landscape of DNN-based classification. While multiple defenses against such
attacks exist for classifiers in the image domain, there have been limited
efforts to protect classifiers in the text domain.
  We present Trojan-Miner (T-Miner) -- a defense framework for Trojan attacks
on DNN-based text classifiers. T-Miner employs a sequence-to-sequence
(seq-2-seq) generative model that probes the suspicious classifier and learns
to produce text sequences that are likely to contain the Trojan trigger.
T-Miner then analyzes the text produced by the generative model to determine if
they contain trigger phrases, and correspondingly, whether the tested
classifier has a backdoor. T-Miner requires no access to the training dataset
or clean inputs of the suspicious classifier, and instead uses synthetically
crafted ""nonsensical"" text inputs to train the generative model. We extensively
evaluate T-Miner on 1100 model instances spanning 3 ubiquitous DNN model
architectures, 5 different classification tasks, and a variety of trigger
phrases. We show that T-Miner detects Trojan and clean models with a 98.75%
overall accuracy, while achieving low false positives on clean models. We also
show that T-Miner is robust against a variety of targeted, advanced attacks
from an adaptive attacker.

logarithmically. Finally, we discuss a proposal to verify our predictions in

ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the
SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model
components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein
and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware
encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer
model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and
gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only
structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species.
Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned
representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme
commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can accurately identify
PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable
insights for advancing research on this new disease.

  2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the unsupervised cross-domain translation problem by
proposing a generative framework, in which the probability distribution of each
domain is represented by a generative cooperative network that consists of an
energy-based model and a latent variable model. The use of generative
cooperative network enables maximum likelihood learning of the domain model by
MCMC teaching, where the energy-based model seeks to fit the data distribution
of domain and distills its knowledge to the latent variable model via MCMC.
Specifically, in the MCMC teaching process, the latent variable model
parameterized by an encoder-decoder maps examples from the source domain to the
target domain, while the energy-based model further refines the mapped results
by Langevin revision such that the revised results match to the examples in the
target domain in terms of the statistical properties, which are defined by the
learned energy function. For the purpose of building up a correspondence
between two unpaired domains, the proposed framework simultaneously learns a
pair of cooperative networks with cycle consistency, accounting for a two-way
translation between two domains, by alternating MCMC teaching. Experiments show
that the proposed framework is useful for unsupervised image-to-image
translation and unpaired image sequence translation.

Thus, devising learnable fusion strategy is a very challenging problem in the

proposed to train RFN. The fusion model learning is accomplished by a novel
two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we train an auto-encoder based
on an innovative nest connection (Nest) concept. Next, the RFN is trained using
the proposed loss functions. The experimental results on public domain data

  Multi-Agent Games: A Theory-of-Mind Approach with Application to Driving Data",,,,,"cs.AI cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reward function, as an incentive representation that recognizes humans'
agency and rationalizes humans' actions, is particularly appealing for modeling
human behavior in human-robot interaction. Inverse Reinforcement Learning is an
effective way to retrieve reward functions from demonstrations. However, it has
always been challenging when applying it to multi-agent settings since the
mutual influence between agents has to be appropriately modeled. To tackle this
challenge, previous work either exploits equilibrium solution concepts by
assuming humans as perfectly rational optimizers with unbounded intelligence or
pre-assigns humans' interaction strategies a priori. In this work, we advocate
that humans are bounded rational and have different intelligence levels when
reasoning about others' decision-making process, and such an inherent and
latent characteristic should be accounted for in reward learning algorithms.
Hence, we exploit such insights from Theory-of-Mind and propose a new
multi-agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning framework that reasons about humans'
latent intelligence levels during learning. We validate our approach in both
zero-sum and general-sum games with synthetic agents and illustrate a practical
application to learning human drivers' reward functions from real driving data.
We compare our approach with two baseline algorithms. The results show that by
reasoning about humans' latent intelligence levels, the proposed approach has
more flexibility and capability to retrieve reward functions that explain
humans' driving behaviors better.

Throughout the training, the network inevitably learns the representation of

underperform in the inference stage once the context changed and can only be
solved by training in every new setting. This eventually leads to the
limitation in practical robotic applications where contexts keep varying. To
cope with this, instead of training a network context by context and hoping it
to generalize, why not stop misleading it with any limited context and start

small defection detection layer utilizing the pose sensitivity of phase

temperature (density) gradient profile throughout or via cooling at the
surface. These distinct mechanisms can act simultaneously to establish a stable
stratification in a flow. Here, we perform a series of direct numerical
simulations of open-channel flows to study adaptation of a neutrally stratified
turbulent flow under the combined or independent action of the aforementioned
mechanisms. We force the fully developed flow with a constant mass flow rate.
This flow forcing technique enables us to keep the bulk Reynolds number
constant throughout our investigation and avoid complications arising from the
acceleration of the bulk flow when a constant pressure gradient approach were
to be adopted to force the flow instead. When both stratification mechanisms
are active, the dimensionless stratification perturbation number emerges as an
external flow control parameter, in addition to the Reynolds, Froude, and
Prandtl numbers. We demonstrate that significant deviations from the
Monin-Obukhov similarity formulation are possible when both types of
stratification mechanisms are active within an otherwise weakly stable flow,
even when the flux Richardson number is well below 0.2. An extended version of
the similarity theory due to Zilitinkevich and Calanca shows promise in
predicting the dimensionless shear for cases where both types of stratification
mechanisms are active, but the extended theory is less accurate for gradients
of scalar. The degree of deviation from neutral dimensionless shear as a
function of the vertical coordinate emerges as a qualitative measure of the
strength of stable stratification for all the cases investigated in this study.

faces the inherent dynamics/uncertainty of wireless connections and edge nodes,
making DL less efficient or even inapplicable under the highly dynamic wireless
edge networks (e.g., using mmW interfaces). This article addresses these
problems by leveraging recent advances in coded computing and the deep dueling
neural network architecture. By introducing coded structures/redundancy, a
distributed learning task can be completed without waiting for straggling
nodes. Unlike conventional coded computing that only optimizes the code
structure, coded distributed learning over the wireless edge also requires to
optimize the selection/scheduling of wireless edge nodes with heterogeneous
connections, computing capability, and straggling effects. However, even
neglecting the aforementioned dynamics/uncertainty, the resulting joint
optimization of coding and scheduling to minimize the distributed learning time
turns out to be NP-hard. To tackle this and to account for the dynamics and
uncertainty of wireless connections and edge nodes, we reformulate the problem

learning algorithm that employs the deep dueling neural network architecture to
find the jointly optimal coding scheme and the best set of edge nodes for

agents, with no transfers. When agents have equal entitlements, the well
established notion of the maximin share (MMS) serves as an attractive fairness
criterion, where to qualify as fair, an allocation needs to give every agent at
least a substantial fraction of her MMS.
  In this paper we consider the case of arbitrary (unequal) entitlements. We
explain shortcomings in previous attempts that extend the MMS to unequal
entitlements. Our conceptual contribution is the introduction of a new notion
of a share, the AnyPrice share (APS), that is appropriate for settings with
arbitrary entitlements. Even for the equal entitlements case, this notion is
new, and satisfies $APS \ge MMS$, where the inequality is sometimes strict. We
present two equivalent definitions for the APS (one as a minimization problem,
the other as a maximization problem), and provide comparisons between the APS
and previous notions of fairness.
  Our main result concerns additive valuations and arbitrary entitlements, for
which we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that gives every agent at least a
$\frac{3}{5}$-fraction of her APS. This algorithm can also be viewed as
providing strategies in a certain natural bidding game, and these strategies
secure each agent at least a $\frac{3}{5}$-fraction of her APS.

it for the generation of bright two-mode correlated twin-beams. In this work,
we provide a rigorous theoretical description of the spatial properties of
bright squeezed light in the presence of strong anisotropy. We investigate a
single-crystal and a two-crystal configuration and demonstrate the generation
of bright correlated twin-beams in such systems at high gain due to anisotropy.

because they are found to exhibit intriguing electronic phenomena of tunable
Mott insulators and unconventional superconductivity. These phenomena are
highly related to the physical mechanism of the interlayer coupling. However,
up to now, there has not existed any theory that can completely interpret the
experimental results of the interlayer conductance of moir\'{e} superlattice.
In order to solve this problem, the superposition of periods and the
corresponding coherence, which are the essential characteristics of moir\'{e}
superlattice, should be considered more sufficiently. Therefore, it is quite
necessary to introduce optical methods to study moir\'{e} superlattices. Here,
we develop a theory for moir\'{e} superlattices which are founded on
traditional optical scattering theory. The theory can interpret both the
continuously decreasing background and the peak of the interlayer conductance
observed in the experiments by a unified mechanism. We show that, the
decreasing background of the interlayer conductance arises from the increasing
strength of the interface potential, and the peak roots from the scattering
resonance of the interface potential. The present work is crucial for
understanding the interlayer coupling of the moir\'{e} superlattice, and
provide a solid theoretical foundation for the application of moir\'{e}
superlattice.

the action in the form of Hamilton's characteristic function. We find that the
power-law duality is basically a classical notion and breaks down at the level
of angular quantization. We propose an ad hoc procedure to preserve the dual

shows a partially synchrotron self-absorbed compact radio core with a
significant core shift, and an optically thin steep-spectrum jet extending
towards the north up to about two parsecs in projection. We also observed NGC
2617 with the electronic Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network

stable flux density of about 1.4 mJy at 5.0 GHz between 2013 June and 2014
January, in agreement with the expectation of a supermassive black hole in the
low accretion rate state. The northern jet component is unlikely to be
associated with the 'inside-out' outburst of 2013. Moreover, we report that

  introduction. The main results are not changed. A shortened version of this
  paper will appear in STOC2022",,,,"math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The question of finding expander graphs with strong vertex expansion
properties such as unique neighbor expansion and lossless expansion is central
to computer science. A barrier to constructing these is that strong notions of
expansion could not be proven via the spectral expansion paradigm.
  A very symmetric and structured family of optimal spectral expanders (i.e.,
Ramanujan graphs) was constructed using number theory by Lubotzky, Phillips and
Sarnak, and was subsequently generalized by others. We call such graphs Number
Theoretic Ramanujan Graphs. These graphs are not only spectrally optimal, but
also posses strong symmetries and rich structure. Thus, it has been widely
conjectured that number theoretic Ramanujan graphs are lossless expanders, or
at least unique neighbor expanders.
  In this work we disprove this conjecture, by showing that there are number
theoretic Ramanujan graphs that are not even unique neighbor expanders. This is
done by introducing a new combinatorial paradigm that we term the closed orbit
method.
  The closed orbit method allows one to construct finite combinatorial objects
with extermal substructures. This is done by observing that there exist
infinite combinatorial structures with extermal substructures, coming from an
action of a subgroup of the automorphism group of the structure. The crux of
our idea is a systematic way to construct a finite quotient of the infinite
structure containing a simple shadow of the infinite substructure, which
maintains its extermal combinatorial property.
  Other applications of the method are to the edge expansion of number
theoretic Ramanujan graphs and vertex expansion of Ramanujan complexes.
Finally, in the field of graph quantum ergodicity we produce number theoretic
Ramanujan graphs with an eigenfunction of small support that corresponds to the
zero eigenvalue. This again contradicts common expectations.

constructing a 3D point cloud map with sequential accumulations of the scan

of dynamic objects act as obstacles and thus impede mobile vehicles from
achieving good localization and navigation performances. To tackle the problem,
this paper presents a novel static map building method called ERASOR,
Egocentric RAtio of pSeudo Occupancy-based dynamic object Removal, which is
fast and robust to motion ambiguity. Our approach directs its attention to the
nature of most dynamic objects in urban environments being inevitably in
contact with the ground. Accordingly, we propose the novel concept called
pseudo occupancy to express the occupancy of unit space and then discriminate
spaces of varying occupancy. Finally, Region-wise Ground Plane Fitting (R-GPF)
is adopted to distinguish static points from dynamic points within the
candidate bins that potentially contain dynamic points. As experimentally
verified on SemanticKITTI, our proposed method yields promising performance
against state-of-the-art methods overcoming the limitations of existing ray

reduce the chances of issues such as load frequency control and the chances of
electricity blackouts. To gain a better understanding of the load that is
likely to be required over the next 24h, estimations under uncertainty are
needed. This is especially difficult in a decentralized electricity market with
many micro-producers which are not under central control.
  In this paper, we investigate the impact of eleven offline learning and five
online learning algorithms to predict the electricity demand profile over the
next 24h. We achieve this through integration within the long-term agent-based
model, ElecSim. Through the prediction of electricity demand profile over the
next 24h, we can simulate the predictions made for a day-ahead market. Once we
have made these predictions, we sample from the residual distributions and
perturb the electricity market demand using the simulation, ElecSim. This
enables us to understand the impact of errors on the long-term dynamics of a
decentralized electricity market.
  We show we can reduce the mean absolute error by 30% using an online
algorithm when compared to the best offline algorithm, whilst reducing the
required tendered national grid reserve required. This reduction in national
grid reserves leads to savings in costs and emissions. We also show that large
errors in prediction accuracy have a disproportionate error on investments made
over a 17-year time frame, as well as electricity mix.

synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR). In contrast
to the conventional SAR ATR algorithms, DistSTN considers a more challenging
practical scenario for non-cooperative targets whose aspect angles for training
are incomplete and limited in a partial range while those of testing samples
are unlimited. To address this issue, instead of learning the pose invariant
features, DistSTN newly involves an elaborated feature disentangling model to
separate the learned pose factors of a SAR target from the identity ones so
that they can independently control the representation process of the target
image. To disentangle the explainable pose factors, we develop a pose
discrepancy spatial transformer module in DistSTN to characterize the intrinsic
transformation between the factors of two different targets with an explicit
geometric model. Furthermore, DistSTN develops an amortized inference scheme
that enables efficient feature extraction and recognition using an
encoder-decoder mechanism. Experimental results with the moving and stationary

effectiveness of our proposed approach. Compared with the other ATR algorithms,
DistSTN can achieve higher recognition accuracy.

we prove that such a layer could lead to a network that cannot be trained at

our extensive empirical evaluation. More precisely, we identified those layers

thus they may easily miss out fine-grained clues due to the person varieties in
image sequences. To address above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel
Global-guided Reciprocal Learning (GRL) framework for video-based person Re-ID.
Specifically, we first propose a Global-guided Correlation Estimation (GCE) to
generate feature correlation maps of local features and global features, which
help to localize the high- and low-correlation regions for identifying the same
person. After that, the discriminative features are disentangled into
high-correlation features and low-correlation features under the guidance of
the global representations. Moreover, a novel Temporal Reciprocal Learning
(TRL) mechanism is designed to sequentially enhance the high-correlation
semantic information and accumulate the low-correlation sub-critical clues.
Extensive experiments are conducted on three public benchmarks. The

channel is inherently violently Doppler-shifted. In this paper, we propose a
new ICI suppression method, referred to as the partially-shifted fast Fourier
transform (PS-FFT), which eliminates the ICI from both the time and frequency
domains. Specifically, the PS-FFT first divides the received signal in the
entire block duration into several short non-overlapping ones to reduce the
channel variation in the time domain. It then applies the Fourier transform at
several predefined frequencies to the received signal in each of these
intervals to compensate Doppler shifts in the frequency domain. Finally, it
weightedly combines the multiple demodulator outputs at each carrier as one
output for symbol detection, with the combiner weights being solved by the
stochastic gradient algorithm. Simulation results show that the PS-FFT
dramatically outperforms the existing classical methods, the partial fast
Fourier transform (P-FFT) and the fractional fast Fourier transform (F-FFT),
for both medium and high Doppler factors and large carrier numbers in terms of
the mean squared error (MSE). Numerically, the MSE of the PS-FFT is reduced by

Based on the well understood acoustic correlates of speech articulation, it has

heuristics, raising the possibility of data-based optimisation. In this work,
we consider the optimization of the parameters based on the direct minimization
of naturally arising task-specific objective functions. The resulting
non-convex cost function is minimized using a population-based search algorithm
to achieve a performance that exceeds previously published performance results
on the same corpus using a relatively low amount of labeled data. Further, the

more than the input mechanical energy, occurs on demand at depressurization at
lower temperatures. The discharging is also manifested as a directly measured
temperature rise of 12 K. The thermodynamic equilibrium nature of the

processes, applying forward and inverse Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop
three novel tools for the game. First, we apply Monte-Carlo learning to fit a
nonlinear approximation of the value function for each state of the game using
a score-based reward model. We show that, when used as a proxy for remaining
scoring resources, this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method used in professional matches by 3 to 10 fold.
Next, we use inverse reinforcement learning, specifically a variant of
guided-cost learning, to infer a linear model of rewards based on expert
performances, assumed here to be play sequences of winning teams. From this
model we explicitly determine the optimal policy for each state and find this
agrees with common intuitions about the game. Finally, we use the inferred
reward models to construct a game simulator that models the posterior
distribution of final scores under different policies. We envisage our
prediction and simulation techniques may provide a fairer alternative for
estimating final scores in interrupted games, while the inferred reward model
may provide useful insights for the professional game to optimize playing
strategy. Further, we anticipate our method of applying RL to this game may
have broader application to other sports with discrete states of play where
teams take turns, such as baseball and rounders.

super-resolution remains a challenging problem due to the high-dimensional and
complex spectral characteristics of hyperspectral data, which make it difficult
to simultaneously capture spatial and spectral information. To deal with this
issue, we propose a novel Feedback Refined Local-Global Network (FRLGN) for the
super-resolution of hyperspectral image. To be specific, we develop a new
Feedback Structure and a Local-Global Spectral Block to alleviate the
difficulty in spatial and spectral feature extraction. The Feedback Structure
can transfer the high-level information to guide the generation process of
low-level feature, which is achieved by a recurrent structure with finite
unfoldings. Furthermore, in order to effectively use the high-level information
passed back, a Local-Global Spectral Block is constructed to handle the
feedback connections. The Local-Global Spectral Block utilizes the feedback
high-level information to correct the low-level feature from local spectral
bands and generates powerful high-level representations among global spectral
bands. By incorporating the Feedback Structure and Local-Global Spectral Block,
the FRLGN can fully exploit spatial-spectral correlations among spectral bands
and gradually reconstruct high-resolution hyperspectral images. The source code

an increasing number of symbolic approaches in bioinformatics are able to
assign multiple items to values occurring near discretization boundaries for
superior robustness, there are no reference principles on how to perform
multi-item discretizations.
  Results: In this study, an unsupervised discretization method, DI2, for
variables with arbitrarily skewed distributions is proposed. DI2 provides
robust guarantees of generalization by placing data corrections using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test before statistically fitting distribution candidates.
DI2 further supports multi-item assignments. Results gathered from biomedical

needed to derive the frequency and properties of exoplanet populations with
separations from $\sim$5 to 300 AU. A careful assessment of the stellar
properties is crucial for a proper understanding of when, where, and how
frequently planets form, and how they evolve. The sensitivity of detection
limits to stellar age makes this a key parameter for direct imaging surveys. We
describe the SpHere INfrared survey for Exoplanets (SHINE), the largest direct
imaging planet-search campaign initiated at the VLT in 2015 in the context of
the SPHERE Guaranteed Time Observations of the SPHERE consortium. In this first
paper we present the selection and the properties of the complete sample of
stars surveyed with SHINE, focusing on the targets observed during the first
phase of the survey (from February 2015 to February 2017). This early sample
composed of 150 stars is used to perform a preliminary statistical analysis of
the SHINE data, deferred to two companion papers presenting the survey
performance, main discoveries, and the preliminary statistical constraints set
by SHINE. Based on a large database collecting the stellar properties of all
young nearby stars in the solar vicinity (including kinematics, membership to
moving groups, isochrones, lithium abundance, rotation, and activity), we
selected the original sample of 800 stars that were ranked in order of priority
according to their sensitivity for planet detection in direct imaging with
SPHERE. The properties of the stars that are part of the early statistical
sample were revisited, including for instance measurements from the GAIA Data
Release 2.

current financial regulatory market risk measure. Its estimation and
optimization are highly unstable against sample fluctuations and become
impossible above a critical ratio $r=N/T$, where $N$ is the number of different
assets in the portfolio, and $T$ is the length of the available time series.
The critical ratio depends on the confidence level $\alpha$, which means we
have a line of critical points on the $\alpha-r$ plane. The large fluctuations
in the estimation of ES can be attenuated by the application of regularizers.
In this paper, we calculate ES analytically under an $\ell_1$ regularizer by
the method of replicas borrowed from the statistical physics of random systems.
The ban on short selling, i.e. a constraint rendering all the portfolio weights
non-negative, is a special case of an asymmetric $\ell_1$ regularizer. Results
are presented for the out-of-sample and the in-sample estimator of the
regularized ES, the estimation error, the distribution of the optimal portfolio
weights and the density of the assets eliminated from the portfolio by the
regularizer. It is shown that the no-short constraint acts as a high volatility
cutoff, in the sense that it sets the weights of the high volatility elements
to zero with higher probability than those of the low volatility items. This
cutoff renormalizes the aspect ratio $r=N/T$, thereby extending the range of
the feasibility of optimization. We find that there is a nontrivial mapping
between the regularized and unregularized problems, corresponding to a
renormalization of the order parameters.

nature including the physical environment, the relativistic bulk motion, the
mechanisms of particle acceleration of GRBs and for studying Lorentz invariance
violation, etc. For the afterglow phase, the highest energy photons detected to
date by the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes extend to the TeV regime.
However, for the prompt phase, years of efforts in searching for the VHE
emission has yielded no statistically significant detections. A wide
field-of-view (FOV) and large effective area above tens of GeV are essential
for detecting the VHE emissions from GRBs in the prompt phase. The High
Altitude Detection of Astronomical Radiation (HADAR) experiment has such
merits. In this paper, we report the estimates of its expected annual GRB
detection rate, which are obtained by combining the performance of the HADAR
instrument with the theoretical calculations based on a phenomenological model
to generate the pseudo-GRB population. The expected detectable gamma-ray signal
from GRBs above the background is then obtained to give the detection rate. In
the spectral model, an extra component is assigned to every GRB event in
addition to the Band function. The results indicate that if the energy of the
cutoff due to internal absorption is higher than 50 GeV, the detection rate for
GRBs for the HADAR experiment is approximately two or three GRBs per year,
which varies slightly depending upon the characteristics of the extra
component.

frequently provoked by one or more high-luminance sources within or close to
the camera field of view. When light rays coming from a high-luminance source
reach the front element of a camera, it can produce intra-reflections within
camera elements that emerge at the film plane forming non-image information or
flare on the captured image. Even though preventive mechanisms are used,
artifacts can appear. In this paper, we propose a robust computational method
to automatically detect and remove flare spot artifacts. Our contribution is
threefold: firstly, we propose a characterization which is based on intrinsic
properties that a flare spot is likely to satisfy; secondly, we define a new
confidence measure able to select flare spots among the candidates; and,
finally, a method to accurately determine the flare region is given. Then, the
detected artifacts are removed by using exemplar-based inpainting. We show that
our algorithm achieve top-tier quantitative and qualitative performance.

by visualizing biological organisms with micrometer scale resolution. However,
due to the diffraction limit, sub-micron/nanometer features are difficult to
resolve. While various super-resolution techniques are developed to achieve
nanometer-scale resolution, they often either require expensive optical setup
or specialized fluorophores. In recent years, deep learning has shown the
potentials to reduce the technical barrier and obtain super-resolution from
diffraction-limited images. For accurate results, conventional deep learning
techniques require thousands of images as a training dataset. Obtaining large
datasets from biological samples is not often feasible due to the
photobleaching of fluorophores, phototoxicity, and dynamic processes occurring
within the organism. Therefore, achieving deep learning-based super-resolution
using small datasets is challenging. We address this limitation with a new
convolutional neural network-based approach that is successfully trained with
small datasets and achieves super-resolution images. We captured 750 images in
total from 15 different field-of-views as the training dataset to demonstrate
the technique. In each FOV, a single target image is generated using the
super-resolution radial fluctuation method. As expected, this small dataset
failed to produce a usable model using traditional super-resolution
architecture. However, using the new approach, a network can be trained to
achieve super-resolution images from this small dataset. This deep learning
model can be applied to other biomedical imaging modalities such as MRI and
X-ray imaging, where obtaining large training datasets is challenging.

estimation of the transverse distribution in the rectangular channel of bed and
wall shear stresses. This study makes use of the Tsallis entropy, genetic
programming (GP) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods to
assess the shear stress distribution (SSD) in the rectangular channel. To
evaluate the results of the Tsallis entropy, GP and ANFIS models, laboratory
observations were used in which shear stress was measured using an optimized
Preston tube. This is then used to measure the SSD in various aspect ratios in
the rectangular channel. To investigate the shear stress percentage, 10 data
series with a total of 112 different data were used. The results of the
sensitivity analysis show that the most influential parameter for the SSD in a
smooth rectangular channel is the dimensionless parameter B/H, Where the
transverse coordinate is B, and the flow depth is H. With the parameters (b/B),
(B/H) for the bed and (z/H), (B/H) for the wall as inputs, the modeling of the
GP was better than the other one. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded
that the use of GP and ANFIS algorithms is more effective in estimating shear
stress in smooth rectangular channels than the Tsallis entropy-based equations.

spiders (Araneae: Theridiosomatidae), which utilize a tension line to deform
their orb webs into conical springs to hunt flying insects. Slingshot spiders
are characterized by their ultrafast launch speeds and accelerations (exceeding
1300 $m/s^2$), however a theoretical approach to characterize the underlying
spatiotemporal web dynamics remains missing. To address this knowledge gap, we
develop a 2D-coupled damped oscillator model of the web. Our model reveals
three key insights into the dynamics of slingshot motion. First, the tension
line plays a dual role: enabling the spider to load elastic energy into the web
for a quick launch (in milliseconds) to displacements of 10-15 body lengths,
but also enabling the spider to halt quickly, attenuating inertial
oscillations. Second, the dominant energy dissipation mechanism is viscous drag
by the silk lines - acting as a low Reynolds number parachute. Third, the web
exhibits underdamped oscillatory dynamics through a finely-tuned balance
between the radial line forces, the tension line force and viscous drag
dissipation. Together, our work suggests that the conical geometry and
tension-line enables the slingshot web to act as both an elastic spring and a
shock absorber, for the multi-functional roles of risky predation and
self-preservation.

use this model to study two important measures of disease control and
eradication, the effective reproductive number $R_t$ and the peak intensive
care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence,
vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Our results suggest that, due to
the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by
a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the
population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast,
with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly
exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. These findings
highlight the complex interplays involved between vaccination and social

fails to converge -- a feature that was exploited for several applications.
Here, we theoretically introduce and experimentally demonstrate a new class of
parity-time symmetric systems [implemented using radio frequency (rf) circuits]
that combine EPs with another type of mathematical singularity associated with
the poles of complex functions. These nearly divergent exceptional points can
exhibit an unprecedentedly large eigenvalue bifurcation beyond those obtained
by standard EPs. Our results pave the way for building a new generation of
telemetering and sensing devices with superior performance.

dynamical systems given by ODEs. The map is built as an artificial neural
network whose weights encode a modeled system. We assume that ODEs are known
and prepare training datasets using the equations directly without computing
numerical time series. Parameter variations are taken into account in the
course of training so that the network model captures bifurcation scenarios of
the modeled system. Theoretical benefit from this approach is that the
universal model admits using common mathematical methods without needing to
develop a unique theory for each particular dynamical equations. Form the
practical point of view the developed method can be considered as an
alternative numerical method for solving dynamical ODEs suitable for running on
contemporary neural network specific hardware. We consider the Lorenz system,
the Roessler system and also Hindmarch-Rose neuron. For these three examples
the network model is created and its dynamics is compared with ordinary
numerical solutions. High similarity is observed for visual images of
attractors, power spectra, bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents.

UTM-30LX, and RPLidar were observed experimentally. Strengths and weaknesses of
each sensor were reviewed so that it can be used as a reference for selecting a
suitable sensor for any particular application. A software application has been
developed in C programming language as a platform for gathering information for
all tested sensors. According to the experiment results, it showed that Hokuyo
UTM-30LX results in random normally distributed error on measuring distance
with average error 21.94 mm and variance 32.11. On the other hand, error
measurement resulted by Kinect and RPLidar strongly depended on measured
distance of the object from the sensors, while measurement error resulted by
Kinect had a negative correlation with the measured distance and the error
resulted by RPLidar sensor had a positive correlation with the measured
distance. The performance of these three sensors for detecting a transparent
object shows that the Kinect sensors can detect the transparent object on its
effective range measurement, Hokuyo UTM-30LX can detect the transparent object
in the distance more than equal to 200 mm, and the RPLidar sensor cannot detect
the transparent object at all tested distance. Lastly, the experiment shows
that the Hokuyo UTM-30LX has the fastest processing time significantly, and the
RPLidar has the slowest processing time significantly, while the processing
time of Kinect sensor was in between. These processing times were not
significantly affected by various tested distance measurement.

system because it provides flexibility and efficiency. This paper addresses
review and design of multi AGVs system (MAGS) and its coordination control to
be implemented at containers terminal logistics systems. It focuses on design
of electric AGV and supervisory control to coordinate multi AGVs. Firstly,
related previous works by other researchers are reviewed including containers
terminal system, application of AGV in logistics systems and multi mobile
robots control systems. Secondly, application of AGV system in containers
terminal is proposed including AGV design specification, AGV control method,
multi AGV system supervisory control method, and containers terminal port
model. Conclusions have been obtained as follows: an electric AGV may be
developed using electric motors with total power between 700-900KW and speed of
228 rpm; a MAGVS is proposed based on free ranging navigation system using GPS,
digital compass and rotary encoder sensors; path planning, coordination and
traffic management control is conducted by the supervisory controller based on
priority based coordinative (PBC) control algorithm; a model of MAGVS for
containers terminal logistics system can be developed using the navigation
system and PBC control algorithm.
