various embedding space dimension values (oedometer models - 1, spherical
models - 3, cylindrical models - 2), differing in one boundary condition
(coupled 1 - constant displacement, coupled 2 - constant stress) are analysed
analytically and numerically. The method of the research is partly analytical,
the models are unified into a single model with unique analytical solution,
every model can be derived from this by inserting the proper boundary condition
and embedding space dimension m. The constants of the solutions are determined
and an approximate time factor and model law are derived for the m >1case which
is identical to the one valid in the oedometer case. The convergence of the
infinite series are examined in the function of the initial condition.
Concerning the total stress at the pile shaft, significant decrease (with the
value of the initial mean pore water pressure) is encountered for the coupled 1
consolidation models, zero stress drop is resulted by the coupled 2 models. The
total stress dissipation test is suggested to be evaluated by the coupled 1
models with a time dependent constitutive law, eg., by adding a relaxation
part-model. The rate of convergence is the smaller if the initial condition is
the closer to the one of a zero solution (beyond the trivial one, a non-trivial
zero solution exists for the coupled 1 model, at the Terzaghi initial
condition).

sector. The inequivalent graded Lie (super)algebras are obtained by solving the

for this mathematical result is to systematically investigate the properties of
dynamical systems invariant under graded (super)algebras. Recent works only
paid attention to the special case of the one-dimensional ${\mathbb
Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Poincar\'e superalgebra. As applications, we
are able to extend certain constructions originally introduced for this special
superalgebra to other listed ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded

Z_2}\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded superspace and of invariant dynamical systems
(both classical worldline sigma models and quantum Hamiltonians). As a further
byproduct we point out that, contrary to ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb

Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded algebra implies the presence of ordinary bosons
and three different types of exotic bosons, with exotic bosons of different
types anticommuting among themselves.

Automatically tracking the evolution of events in large news corpora still
remains a challenging task, and the existing techniques for Event Detection and
Tracking do not place a particular focus on tracking events in very large and
constantly updating news feeds. Here, we propose a new method for robust and
efficient event detection and tracking, which we call RevDet algorithm. RevDet
adopts an iterative clustering approach for tracking events. Even though many
events continue to develop for many days or even months, RevDet is able to
detect and track those events while utilizing only a constant amount of space
on main memory. We also devise a redundancy removal strategy which effectively
eliminates duplicate news articles and substantially reduces the size of data.
We construct a large, comprehensive new ground truth dataset specifically for
event detection and tracking approaches by augmenting two existing datasets:
w2e and GDELT. We implement RevDet algorithm and evaluate its performance on
the ground truth event chains. We discover that our algorithm is able to
accurately recover event chains in the ground-truth dataset. We also compare
the memory efficiency of our algorithm with the standard single pass clustering
approach, and demonstrate the appropriateness of our algorithm for event

stochastic optimization (SO) problems with a smooth (non-convex) objective $f$
and a stochastic first-order oracle. SG's attractiveness is due in part to its
simplicity of executing a single step along the negative subsampled gradient
direction to update the incumbent iterate. In this paper, we question SG's
choice of executing a single step as opposed to multiple steps between
subsample updates. Our investigation leads naturally to generalizing SG into
Retrospective Approximation (RA) where, during each iteration, a ""deterministic
solver"" executes possibly multiple steps on a subsampled deterministic problem
and stops when further solving is deemed unnecessary from the standpoint of
statistical efficiency. RA thus rigorizes what is appealing for implementation
-- during each iteration, ""plug in"" a solver, e.g., L-BFGS line search or
Newton-CG, as is, and solve only to the extent necessary. We develop a complete
theory using relative error of the observed gradients as the principal object,
demonstrating that almost sure and $L_1$ consistency of RA are preserved under
especially weak conditions when sample sizes are increased at appropriate
rates. We also characterize the iteration and oracle complexity (for linear and
sub-linear solvers) of RA, and identify a practical termination criterion
leading to optimal complexity rates. To subsume non-convex $f$, we present a
certain ""random central limit theorem"" that incorporates the effect of
curvature across all first-order critical points, demonstrating that the
asymptotic behavior is described by a certain mixture of normals. The message
from our numerical experiments is that the ability of RA to incorporate
existing second-order deterministic solvers in a strategic manner might be
important from the standpoint of dispensing with hyper-parameter tuning.

type. NuSTAR observed LS 5039 during its entire 3.9 day binary period. We
performed a periodic signal search up to 1000 Hz which did not produce credible
period candidates. We do see the 9.05 s period candidate, originally reported
by Yoneda et al. 2020 using the same data, in the Fourier power spectrum, but
we find that the statistical significance of this feature is too low to claim
it as a real detection. We also did not find significant bursts or
quasi-periodic variability. The modulation with the orbital period is clearly
seen and remains unchanged over a decade long timescale when compared to the
earlier Suzaku light curve. The joint analysis of the NuSTAR and Suzaku XIS
data shows that the 0.7-70 keV spectrum can be satisfactory described by a
single absorbed power-law model with no evidence of cutoff at higher energies.
The slope of the spectrum anti-correlates with the flux during the binary
orbit. Therefore, if LS 5039 hosts a young neutron star, its X-ray pulsations
appear to be outshined by the intrabinary shock emission. The lack of spectral
lines and/or an exponential cutoff at higher energies suggests that the
putative neutron star is not actively accreting. Although a black hole scenario
still remains a possibility, the lack of variability or Fe K$\alpha$ lines,

commonly occurs during relative sliding of two elastic solids. In adhesive
polymer contacts, where elasticity and interface adhesion are strongly coupled,
stick--slip results from the propagation of slow detachment waves at the
interface. Using \emph{in situ} imaging experiments at an adhesive contact, we
show the occurrence of two distinct detachment waves moving parallel
(Schallamach wave) and anti-parallel (separation wave) to the applied remote
sliding. Both waves cause slip in the same direction and travel at speeds much
lesser than any elastic wave speed. We use an elastodynamic framework to
describe the propagation of these slow detachment waves at an elastic-rigid
interface and obtain governing integral equations in the low wave speed limit.
These integral equations are solved in closed form when the elastic solid is
incompressible. Two solution branches emerge, corresponding to opposite moving
detachment waves, just as seen in the experiments. A numerical scheme is used
to obtain interface stresses and velocities for the incompressible case for
arbitrary Poisson ratio. Based on these results, we explicitly demonstrate a
correspondence between propagating slow detachment waves and a static
bi-material interface crack. Based on this, and coupled with a recently
proposed fracture analogy for dynamic friction, we develop a phase diagram
showing domains of possible occurrence of stick--slip via detachment waves
vis-\'a-vis steady interface sliding.

to converge efficiently to first-order stationary points which, however, can be
saddle points in nonconvex optimization. It has been observed that a stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) step introduces anistropic noise around saddle points
for deep learning and non-convex half space learning problems, which indicates
that SGD satisfies the correlated negative curvature (CNC) condition for these
problems. Therefore, we propose to use a separate SGD step to help the SCSG
method escape from strict saddle points, resulting in the CNC-SCSG method. The
SGD step plays a role similar to noise injection but is more stable. We prove
that the resultant algorithm converges to a second-order stationary point with
a convergence rate of $\tilde{O}( \epsilon^{-2} log( 1/\epsilon))$ where
$\epsilon$ is the pre-specified error tolerance. This convergence rate is
independent of the problem dimension, and is faster than that of CNC-SGD. A
more general framework is further designed to incorporate the proposed CNC-SCSG
into any first-order method for the method to escape saddle points. Simulation
studies illustrate that the proposed algorithm can escape saddle points in much
fewer epochs than the gradient descent methods perturbed by either noise
injection or a SGD step.

simultaneous characterization of two electrodes remains challenging due to
practical difficulties posed by the dampening from fixture parasitics and the

consequent monitoring of mass deposition and viscous loading on two crystals,
the working electrode (WE) and the counter electrode (CE). A novel cor-rection
approach along with a three standard complex impedance calibration is employed
to overcome the effect of dampening while keeping high spectral sensitivity.
Separation of viscous loading and rigid mass deposition is achieved by robust
characterization of the complex impedance at the resonance frequency.
Validation of the presented system is done by cyclic voltammetry
characterization of Ag underpotential deposition on gold. The results indicate
mass deposition of 412.2 ng for the WE and 345.6 ng for the CE, reflecting a
difference of the initially present Ag adhered to the surface. We also
performed higher harmonic measurements that further corroborate the sensitivity

bright rims are probably remnant molecular clouds heated and stripped by the
massive star. Matching these rims in molecular lines and optical images, we
construct a model of the three-dimensional structure of the NAP complex. Two
groups of molecular clumps/filaments are on the near side of the bubble, one
being pushed toward us, whereas the other is moving toward the bubble. Another
group is on the far side of the bubble and moving away. The young stellar
objects in the Gulf region reside in three different clusters, each hosted by a
cloud from one of the three molecular clump groups. Although all gas content in
the NAP is impacted by feedback from the central O star, some regions show no

With an exoskeleton, the protective shell becomes part of the main robot
structure, thereby minimizing its loss in payload capacity. Our design is
simple to build and customize using cheap components (e.g. bamboo skewers) and
consumer-grade 3D printers. The result is CogniFly, a sub-250g autonomous
quadcopter that survives multiple collisions at speeds up to 7m/s. In addition
to its collision-resiliency, CogniFly is easy to program using Python or Buzz,
carries sensors that allow it to fly for approx. 17min without the need of GPS
or an external motion capture system, has enough computing power to run deep
neural network models on-board and was designed to facilitate integration with
an automated battery swapping system. This structure becomes an ideal platform
for high-risk activities (such as flying in a cluttered environment or
reinforcement learning training) by dramatically reducing the risks of damaging
its own hardware or the environment. Source code, 3D files, instructions and
videos are available through the project's website

variational solutions to coloring operator equations driven by spatial white
noise, with an elliptic self-adjoint pseudodifferential coloring operator from
the H\""ormander class. This includes the Mat\'ern class of GRFs as a special
case. Using biorthogonal multiresolution analyses on the manifold, we prove
that the precision and covariance operators, respectively, may be identified
with bi-infinite matrices and finite sections may be diagonally preconditioned
rendering the condition number independent of the dimension $p$ of this
section. We prove that a tapering strategy by thresholding applied on finite
sections of the bi-infinite precision and covariance matrices results in
optimally numerically sparse approximations. That is, asymptotically only
linearly many nonzero matrix entries are sufficient to approximate the original
section of the bi-infinite covariance or precision matrix using this tapering
strategy to arbitrary precision. The locations of these nonzero matrix entries
are known a priori. The tapered covariance or precision matrices may also be
optimally diagonally preconditioned. Analysis of the relative size of the
entries of the tapered covariance matrices motivates novel, multilevel Monte
Carlo (MLMC) oracles for covariance estimation, in sample complexity that
scales log-linearly with respect to the number $p$ of parameters. In addition,
we propose and analyze a novel compressive algorithm for simulating and kriging
of GRFs. The complexity (work and memory vs. accuracy) of these three
algorithms scales near-optimally in terms of the number of parameters $p$ of
the sample-wise approximation of the GRF in Sobolev scales.

generate LKFs at high spatial grid resolution, typically with a grid spacing
below 5 km. Besides grid spacing, other aspects of a numerical implementation,
such as discretization details, may affect the number and definition of
simulated LKFs. To explore these effects, the solutions of sea ice models with
different grid spacings, mesh types, and numerical discretization techniques
are compared in an idealized configuration, which could also serve as a
benchmark problem in the future. The A, B, and C-grid discretizations of sea
ice dynamics on quadrilateral meshes leads to a similar number of LKFs as the
A-grid approximation on triangular meshes (with the same number of vertices).
The discretization on an Arakawa CD-grid on both structured quadrilateral and
triangular meshes resolves the same number of LKFs as conventional Arakawa
A-grid, B-grid, and C-grid approaches, but on two times coarser meshes. This is
due to the fact that the CD-grid approach has a higher number of degrees of
freedom to discretize the velocity field. Due to its enhanced resolving
properties, the CD-grid discretization is an attractive alternative to
conventional discretizations.

studied because it is so new and involves asymmetry in policy and intent not

is critical that agents infer human intent and adapt their polices for smooth
coordination. Most literature in human-agent teaming builds agents referencing
a learned human model. Though these agents are guaranteed to perform well with
the learned model, they lay heavy assumptions on human policy such as
optimality and consistency, which is unlikely in many real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a novel adaptive agent architecture in human-model-free
setting on a two-player cooperative game, namely Team Space Fortress (TSF).
Previous human-human team research have shown complementary policies in TSF
game and diversity in human players' skill, which encourages us to relax the
assumptions on human policy. Therefore, we discard learning human models from
human data, and instead use an adaptation strategy on a pre-trained library of
exemplar policies composed of RL algorithms or rule-based methods with minimal
assumptions of human behavior. The adaptation strategy relies on a novel
similarity metric to infer human policy and then selects the most complementary
policy in our library to maximize the team performance. The adaptive agent
architecture can be deployed in real-time and generalize to any off-the-shelf
static agents. We conducted human-agent experiments to evaluate the proposed
adaptive agent framework, and demonstrated the suboptimality, diversity, and
adaptability of human policies in human-agent teams.

EU and the USA, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, ePrivacy
Regulation, and California Consumer Privacy Act. Research has revealed novel
tracking and personal identifiable information leakage methods that first- and
third-parties employ on websites around the world, as well as the intensity of
tracking performed on such websites. However, for the sake of scaling to cover
a large portion of the Web, most past studies focused on homepages of websites,
and did not look deeper into the tracking practices on their topical subpages.
The majority of studies focused on the Global North markets such as the EU and
the USA. Large markets such as India, which covers 20% of the world population
and has no explicit privacy laws, have not been studied in this regard.
  We aim to address these gaps and focus on the following research questions:
Is tracking on topical subpages of Indian news websites different from their
homepage? Do third-party trackers prefer to track specific topics? How does
this preference compare to the similarity of content shown on these topical
subpages? To answer these questions, we propose a novel method for automatic
extraction and categorization of Indian news topical subpages based on the
details in their URLs. We study the identified topical subpages and compare
them with their homepages with respect to the intensity of cookie injection and
third-party embeddedness and type. We find differential user tracking among
subpages, and between subpages and homepages. We also find a preferential
attachment of third-party trackers to specific topics. Also, embedded
third-parties tend to track specific subpages simultaneously, revealing
possible user profiling in action.

An IXP Perspective on DDoS Amplification Attacks","To appear at PAM 2021",,,,"cs.CR cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  DDoS attacks remain a major security threat to the continuous operation of
Internet edge infrastructures, web services, and cloud platforms. While a large
body of research focuses on DDoS detection and protection, to date we
ultimately failed to eradicate DDoS altogether. Yet, the landscape of DDoS
attack mechanisms is even evolving, demanding an updated perspective on DDoS
attacks in the wild. In this paper, we identify up to 2608 DDoS amplification
attacks at a single day by analyzing multiple Tbps of traffic flows at a major
IXP with a rich ecosystem of different networks. We observe the prevalence of
well-known amplification attack protocols (e.g., NTP, CLDAP), which should no
longer exist given the established mitigation strategies. Nevertheless, they
pose the largest fraction on DDoS amplification attacks within our observation
and we witness the emergence of DDoS attacks using recently discovered
amplification protocols (e.g., OpenVPN, ARMS, Ubiquity Discovery Protocol). By
analyzing the impact of DDoS on core Internet infrastructure, we show that DDoS
can overload backbone-capacity and that filtering approaches in prior work omit
97% of the attack traffic.

independent alignment factors $\varsigma_f$. In this analysis we conclude that,
due to the additional contributions corresponding to the Aligned two-Higgs
Doublet Model together with extra sources of CP-violation for the $V=Z$
channel, the Standard Model predictions can be significantly modified in a
great region of the parameter space. These deviations, that could be
potentially measured at the High Luminosity LHC or future Higgs factories,
would be a clear signal of new physics, and would shed new light on the
possible extensions of the Standard Model and new sources of CP-violation.

robot navigation in partially or fully unknown environments, with the
capability of on-the-fly adjustment of the navigation function when new
obstacles are discovered by the robot. Appropriate navigation controllers,
applicable to robots with local, sector bounded sensing, are presented and
analyzed for a~kinematic point-mass robot and then for the dynamic point-mass

for online, fast-feedback based navigation. In addition to the analytic
guarantees, simulation studies are presented to verify the effectiveness of the

the economic literature. This model assumes normality for the error
distribution and is not recommended for cases where positive skewness is
present. Moreover, in regression analysis, it is well-known that a quantile
regression approach allows us to study the influences of the explanatory
variables on the dependent variable considering different quantiles. Therefore,
we propose in this paper a quantile tobit regression model based on
quantile-based log-symmetric distributions. The proposed methodology allows us
to model data with positive skewness (which is not suitable for the classic
tobit model), and to study the influence of the quantiles of interest, in
addition to accommodating heteroscedasticity. The model parameters are
estimated using the maximum likelihood method and an elaborate Monte Carlo
study is performed to evaluate the performance of the estimates. Finally, the
proposed methodology is illustrated using two female labor supply data sets.
The results show that the proposed log-symmetric quantile tobit model has a
better fit than the classic tobit model.

the difference between the predicted and the real-time estimated follower

to their ability to trap significant amounts of pebbles. While the gas motions
and trapping properties of two-dimensional vortices have been studied in enough
detail in the literature, pebble trapping in three dimensions has received less
attention, due to the higher computational demand. Here we use the Pencil Code
to study 3D vortices generated by convective overstability and the trapping of
solids within them. The gas is unstratified whereas the pebbles settle to the
midplane due to vertical gravity. We find that for pebbles of normalized
friction times of St = 0.05 and St = 1, and dust-to-gas ratio
$\varepsilon=0.01$, the vortex column in the midplane is strongly perturbed.
Yet, when the initial dust-to-gas ratio is decreased the vortices remain stable
and function as efficient pebble traps. Streaming instability is triggered even
for the lowest dust-to-gas ratio ($\varepsilon_0 = 10^{-4}$) and smallest
pebble sizes (St = 0.05) we assumed, showing a path for planetesimal formation
in vortex cores from even extremely subsolar metallicity. To estimate if the
reached overdensities can be held together solely by their own gravity we
estimate the Roche density at different radii. Depending on disk model and
radial location of the pebble clump we do reach concentrations higher than the
Roche density. We infer that if self-gravity was included for the pebbles, then
gravitational collapse would likely occur.

that of nonlinear term. Since the attractive kernel is strong singularity, the
weakly mixing has destabilizing effect in addition to the enhanced dissipation
effect, which makes the problem more complicated and difficult. In this paper,
we establish the $L^\infty$-criterion and obtain the global $L^\infty$ estimate
of the solution through some new ideas and techniques. Combined with
\cite{Shi.2019}, we discuss all cases of generalized Keller-Segel system with
mixing effect, which was proposed by Kiselev, Xu (see \cite{Kiselev.2016}) and
Hopf, Rodrigo (see \cite{Hopf.2018}). Based on more precise estimate of
solution and the resolvent estimate of semigroup operator, we introduce a new
method to study the enhanced dissipation effect of mixing in generalized
parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel equation with a fractional dissipation. And the
RAGE theorem is no longer needed in our analysis.

series of practical relevant computational problems involving high-dimensional

mathematical results in the scientific literature which study the approximation

the curse of dimensionality in the approximation of certain target function
classes in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating ANNs
grows at most polynomially in the dimension $d \in \mathbb{N}$ of the target

practice. So far the research community has focused exclusively on optimizing
fuzzy join \textit{scalability}. However, practitioners today also struggle to
optimize fuzzy-join \textit{quality}, because they face a daunting space of
parameters (e.g., distance-functions, distance-thresholds,
tokenization-options, etc.), and often have to resort to a manual
trial-and-error approach to program these parameters in order to optimize
fuzzy-join quality. This key challenge of automatically generating high-quality
fuzzy-join programs has received surprisingly little attention thus far.
  In this work, we study the problem of ""auto-program"" fuzzy-joins. Leveraging
a geometric interpretation of distance-functions, we develop an unsupervised
\textsc{Auto-FuzzyJoin} framework that can infer suitable fuzzy-join programs
on given input tables, without requiring explicit human input such as labeled
training data. Using \textsc{Auto-FuzzyJoin}, users only need to provide two
input tables $L$ and $R$, and a desired precision target $\tau$ (say 0.9).
\textsc{Auto-FuzzyJoin} leverages the fact that one of the input is a reference
table to automatically program fuzzy-joins that meet the precision target
$\tau$ in expectation, while maximizing fuzzy-join recall (defined as the
number of correctly joined records).
  Experiments on both existing benchmarks and a new benchmark with 50
fuzzy-join tasks created from Wikipedia data suggest that the proposed
\textsc{Auto-FuzzyJoin} significantly outperforms existing unsupervised
approaches, and is surprisingly competitive even against supervised approaches
(e.g., Magellan and DeepMatcher) when 50\% of ground-truth labels are used as

developed in recent years -- both research tools and industrial products --
such as Structure 101, SonarQube, and DV8. Each of these tools identifies
problematic files using their own definitions and measures. But to what extent
do these tools agree with each other in terms of the files that they identify
as problematic? If the top-ranked files reported by these tools are largely
consistent, then we can be confident in using any of these tools. Otherwise, a
problem of accuracy arises. In this paper, we report the results of an
empirical study analyzing 10 projects using multiple tools. Our results show
that: 1) these tools report very different results even for the most common
measures, such as size, complexity, file cycles, and package cycles. 2) These
tools also differ dramatically in terms of the set of problematic files they
identify, since each implements its own definitions of ""problematic"". After
normalizing by size, the most problematic file sets that the tools identify
barely overlap. 3) Our results show that code-based measures, other than size
and complexity, do not even moderately correlate with a file's change-proneness
or error-proneness. In contrast, co-change-related measures performed better.
Our results suggest that, to identify files with true technical debt -- those
that experience excessive changes or bugs -- co-change information must be
considered. Code-based measures are largely ineffective at pinpointing true
debt. Finally, this study reveals the need for the community to create
benchmarks and data sets to assess the accuracy of software analysis tools in
terms of commonly used measures.

  Detection","To appear in CVPR 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has been exploited to design
feature pyramid networks (FPNs) and achieved promising results for visual
object detection. Encouraged by the success, we propose a novel One-Shot Path
Aggregation Network Architecture Search (OPANAS) algorithm, which significantly
improves both searching efficiency and detection accuracy. Specifically, we
first introduce six heterogeneous information paths to build our search space,
namely top-down, bottom-up, fusing-splitting, scale-equalizing, skip-connect
and none. Second, we propose a novel search space of FPNs, in which each FPN
candidate is represented by a densely-connected directed acyclic graph (each
node is a feature pyramid and each edge is one of the six heterogeneous
information paths). Third, we propose an efficient one-shot search method to
find the optimal path aggregation architecture, that is, we first train a
super-net and then find the optimal candidate with an evolutionary algorithm.
Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed OPANAS for object
detection: (1) OPANAS is more efficient than state-of-the-art methods (e.g.,
NAS-FPN and Auto-FPN), at significantly smaller searching cost (e.g., only 4
GPU days on MS-COCO); (2) the optimal architecture found by OPANAS
significantly improves main-stream detectors including RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN
and Cascade R-CNN, by 2.3-3.2 % mAP comparing to their FPN counterparts; and
(3) a new state-of-the-art accuracy-speed trade-off (52.2 % mAP at 7.6 FPS) at
smaller training costs than comparable state-of-the-arts. Code will be released
at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/OPANAS.

on separable pairing interaction of Ref. [1]. The optimization of the scaling
factors of this interaction to experimental data clearly reveals its isospin
dependence in neutron subsystem. However, the situation is less certain in
proton subsystem since similar accuracy of the description of pairing
indicators can be achieved both with isospin-dependent and mass-dependent
scaling factors. The differences in the functional dependencies of scaling
factors lead to the uncertainties in the prediction of proton and neutron
pairing properties which are especially pronounced at high isospin and could
have a significant impact on some physical observables. For a given part of
nuclear chart the scaling factors for spherical nuclei are smaller than those
for deformed ones; this feature exists also in non-relativistic density
functional theories. Its origin is traced back to particle-vibration coupling
in odd-$A$ nuclei which is missing in all existing global studies of pairing.
Although the present investigation is based on the NL5(E) covariant energy
density functional (CEDF), its general conclusions are expected to be valid
also for other CEDFs built at the Hartree level.

derived forms such as the projection method of Taira and Colonius (J. Comput.
Phys., 2007), have been useful for simulating flow physics in problems with
moving interfaces on stationary grids. However, in their interface treatment,
these methods do not distinguish one side from the other, but rather, apply the
motion constraint to both sides, and the associated interface force is an
inseparable mix of contributions from each side. In this work, we define a
discrete Heaviside function, a natural companion to the familiar discrete Dirac
delta function (DDF), to define a masked version of each field on the grid
which, to within the error of the DDF, takes the intended value of the field on
the respective sides of the interface. From this foundation we develop discrete
operators and identities that are uniformly applicable to any surface geometry.
We use these to develop extended forms of prototypical partial differential
equations, including Poisson, convection-diffusion, and incompressible
Navier-Stokes, that govern the discrete masked fields. These equations contain
the familiar forcing term of the IBM, but also additional terms that regularize
the jumps in field quantities onto the grid and enable us to individually
specify the constraints on field behavior on each side of the interface.
Drawing the connection between these terms and the layer potentials in elliptic
problems, we refer to them generically as immersed layers. We demonstrate the
application of the method to several representative problems, including
two-dimensional incompressible flows inside a rotating cylinder and external to
a rotating square.

Although prior works struggled to localize objects through various spatial

information from the trained classification network is neglected. In this
paper, we propose a two-stage approach, termed structure-preserving activation
(SPA), toward fully leveraging the structure information incorporated in
convolutional features for WSOL. First, a restricted activation module (RAM) is
designed to alleviate the structure-missing issue caused by the classification
network on the basis of the observation that the unbounded classification map
and global average pooling layer drive the network to focus only on object
parts. Second, we designed a post-process approach, termed self-correlation map
generating (SCG) module to obtain structure-preserving localization maps on the
basis of the activation maps acquired from the first stage. Specifically, we
utilize the high-order self-correlation (HSC) to extract the inherent
structural information retained in the learned model and then aggregate HSC of
multiple points for precise object localization. Extensive experiments on two
publicly available benchmarks including CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC show that the

a tunable-emittance ""skin"" that can tune its heat dissipation according to
various thermal conditions. The existing schemes solely relying on far-field
thermal radiation, which are based on mechanical, electrochromic or
thermochromic working principles, are difficult to combine the advantages of
all-solid-state structure, actively and accurate tuning, and large tuning range
of heat flux. In this work, we propose a near-field radiation assisted (NFRA)
smart skin for thermal control which can tune the heat rejection accurately and
in a large range. It contains a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structure,
where the carrier distribution in the semiconductor layer can be electrically
altered. In this way, the near-field heat flux, and ultimately the skin
emission power expressed using effective emittance, can be controlled as a
function of the applied voltage. The variation range of the effective emittance
can exceed 0.7 when adjusting the applied voltage from -10 V to 100 V with our
preliminary design. This work opens a new way of smart skin design for active
spacecraft thermal control.

segmentation model through incremental learning (IL). In each IL stage, we lose
access to the previous annotations, whose knowledge is assumingly captured by
the current model, and gain the access to a new dataset with annotations of new
organ categories, from which we learn to update the organ segmentation model to
include the new organs. We give the first attempt to conjecture that the
different distribution is the key reason for 'catastrophic forgetting' that

to medical image scenarios. Extensive experiments on five open-sourced datasets

number of datasets with annotations; however, curating such datasets is
burdensome, especially for medical images. To relieve such a burden for a
landmark detection task, we explore the feasibility of using only a single
annotated image and propose a novel framework named Cascade Comparing to Detect

Self-supervised learning (CC2D-SSL) and 2) Training with pseudo-labels
(CC2D-TPL). CC2D-SSL captures the consistent anatomical information in a
coarse-to-fine fashion by comparing the cascade feature representations and
generates predictions on the training set. CC2D-TPL further improves the
performance by training a new landmark detector with those predictions. The
effectiveness of CC2D is evaluated on a widely-used public dataset of
cephalometric landmark detection, which achieves a competitive detection

fully-supervised methods using a lot more than one training image.

introduce theory that shows that, under certain conditions, this alteration of

weather problems. Unlike previous weather analogs that are sought within a
large spatial domain and an extended temporal window, AnEn strictly confines
space and time, and independently generates results at each grid point within a
short time window. AnEn can find similar forecasts that lead to accurate and
calibrated ensemble forecasts. The central core of the AnEn technique is a
similarity metric that sorts historical forecasts with respect to a new target
prediction. A commonly used metric is Euclidean distance. However, a
significant difficulty using this metric is the definition of the weights for
all the parameters. Generally, feature selection and extensive weight search
are needed.
  This paper proposes a novel definition of weather analogs through a Machine

networks that are trained and instantiated to search for weather analogs. This
new metric allows incorporating all variables without requiring a prior feature
selection and weight optimization. Experiments are presented on the application
of this new metric to forecast wind speed and solar irradiance. Results show
that the ML metric generally outperforms the original metric. The ML metric has
a better capability to correct for larger errors and to take advantage of a
larger search repository. Spatial predictions using a learned metric also show
the ability to define effective latent features that are transferable to other
locations.

that a CPU is shared across users, e.g., in the cloud. The existing attacks
rely on sensing the micro-architectural state changes made by victims, and this
assumption can be invalidated by combining spatial (\eg, Intel CAT) and
temporal isolation (\eg, time protection). In this work, we advance the state
of cache side-channel attacks by showing stateless cache side-channel attacks
that cannot be defeated by both spatial and temporal isolation.
  This side-channel exploits the timing difference resulted from interconnect
congestion. Specifically, to complete cache transactions, for Intel CPUs, cache
lines would travel across cores via the CPU mesh interconnect. Nonetheless, the
mesh links are shared by all cores, and cache isolation does not segregate the
traffic. An attacker can generate interconnect traffic to contend with the
victim's on a mesh link, hoping that extra delay will be measured. With the
variant delays, the attacker can deduce the memory access pattern of a victim
program, and infer its sensitive data. Based on this idea, we implement Volcano
and test it against the existing RSA implementations of JDK. We found the RSA
private key used by a victim process can be partially recovered. In the end, we
propose a few directions for defense and call for the attention of the security
community.

One such spectroscopy technique utilizes non-classical correlations among

three photons. In this measurement, time-resolved entangled photon spectroscopy
with monochromatic pumping [J. Chem. Phys. 153, 051102 (2020).] is integrated
with the frequency-dispersed two-photon counting technique, which suppresses
undesired accidental photon counts in the detector and thus allows one to
separate the weak desired signal. This time-resolved frequency-dispersed
two-photon counting signal, which is a function of two frequencies, is shown to
provide the same information as that of coherent two-dimensional optical
spectra. The spectral distribution of the phase-matching function works as a
frequency filter to selectively resolve a specific region of the
two-dimensional spectra, whereas the excited-state dynamics under investigation
are temporally resolved in the time region longer than the entanglement time.
The signal is not subject to Fourier limitations on the joint temporal and
spectral resolution, and therefore, it is expected to be useful for
investigating complex molecular systems in which multiple electronic states are
present within a narrow energy range.

safety and efficiency performance to optimize a long-term objective, which is
challenging due to the dynamic, stochastic, and adversarial characteristics.
The Rule-based methods often lead to conservative driving on this task while
the learning-based methods have difficulties meeting the safety requirements.
In this paper, we propose an RL-based end-to-end decision-making method under a
framework of offline training and online correction, called the Shielded
Distributional Soft Actor-critic (SDSAC). The SDSAC adopts the policy
evaluation with safety consideration and a safety shield parameterized with the
barrier function in its offline training and online correction, respectively.
These two measures support each other for better safety while not damaging the

sequential decision making and extensive-form games. In large two-player
zero-sum imperfect-information games, modern extensions of counterfactual
regret minimization (CFR) are currently the practical state of the art for
computing a Nash equilibrium. Most regret-minimization algorithms for tree-form
sequential decision making, including CFR, require (i) an exact model of the
player's decision nodes, observation nodes, and how they are linked, and (ii)
full knowledge, at all times t, about the payoffs -- even in parts of the
decision space that are not encountered at time t. Recently, there has been
growing interest towards relaxing some of those restrictions and making regret
minimization applicable to settings for which reinforcement learning methods
have traditionally been used -- for example, those in which only black-box
access to the environment is available. We give the first, to our knowledge,
regret-minimization algorithm that guarantees sublinear regret with high
probability even when requirement (i) -- and thus also (ii) -- is dropped. We
formalize an online learning setting in which the strategy space is not known
to the agent and gets revealed incrementally whenever the agent encounters new
decision points. We give an efficient algorithm that achieves $O(T^{3/4})$
regret with high probability for that setting, even when the agent faces an
adversarial environment. Our experiments show it significantly outperforms the
prior algorithms for the problem, which do not have such guarantees. It can be
used in any application for which regret minimization is useful: approximating
Nash equilibrium or quantal response equilibrium, approximating coarse
correlated equilibrium in multi-player games, learning a best response,
learning safe opponent exploitation, and online play against an unknown

purpose, they tend to be computationally demanding in CPS applications since
here, the computational resources such as processor availability tend to be
scarce, time-varying and difficult to model. A natural idea then is to design
""computation-aware"" algorithms that can dynamically adapt with respect to the
processor availability in a provably safe manner. Even though this idea should
be applicable in broader context, here we focus on ellipsoidal
over-approximations. We demonstrate that the algorithms for ellipsoidal
over-approximation of reach sets of uncertain linear systems, are well-suited
for anytime implementation in the sense the quality of the over-approximation
can be dynamically traded off depending on the computational time available,
all the while guaranteeing safety. We give a numerical example to illustrate
the idea, and point out possible future directions.

decision making by modeling tree-form interactions between an agent and a
potentially adversarial environment. It captures the online decision-making
problems that each player faces in an extensive-form game, as well as Markov
decision processes and partially-observable Markov decision processes where the
agent conditions on observed history. Over the past decade, there has been
considerable effort into designing online optimization methods for TFSDM.
Virtually all of that work has been in the full-feedback setting, where the
agent has access to counterfactuals, that is, information on what would have
happened had the agent chosen a different action at any decision node. Little
is known about the bandit setting, where that assumption is reversed (no
counterfactual information is available), despite this latter setting being
well understood for almost 20 years in one-shot decision making. In this paper,
we give the first algorithm for the bandit linear optimization problem for
TFSDM that offers both (i) linear-time iterations (in the size of the decision
tree) and (ii) $O(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret in expectation compared to any
fixed strategy, at all times $T$. This is made possible by new results that we
derive, which may have independent uses as well: 1) geometry of the dilated
entropy regularizer, 2) autocorrelation matrix of the natural sampling scheme
for sequence-form strategies, 3) construction of an unbiased estimator for
linear losses for sequence-form strategies, and 4) a refined regret analysis
for mirror descent when using the dilated entropy regularizer.

in a non-cooperative game, the expected weighted ergodic distribution of play
converges to the set of coarse correlated equilibria if players use algorithms
that have ""no weighted-regret"" in the above scenario, even if they have linear
regret due to too large delays. For a two-player zero-sum game, we show that no
weighted-regret is sufficient for the weighted ergodic average of play to
converge to the set of Nash equilibria. We prove that the FKM algorithm with
$n$ dimensions achieves an expected regret of
$O\left(nT^{\frac{3}{4}}+\sqrt{n}T^{\frac{1}{3}}D^{\frac{1}{3}}\right)$ and the

task-specific reward after a long unsupervised pre-training phase. In Atari

On DMControl suite, APT beats all baselines in terms of asymptotic performance

widely applied on the CT metal artifact reduction (MAR) task. Supervised
methods such as Dual Domain Network (Du-DoNet) work well on simulation data;
however, their performance on clinical data is limited due to domain gap.
Unsupervised methods are more generalized, but do not eliminate artifacts
completely through the sole processing on the image domain. To combine the
advantages of both MAR methods, we propose an unpaired dual-domain network
(U-DuDoNet) trained using unpaired data. Unlike the artifact disentanglement
network (ADN) that utilizes multiple encoders and decoders for disentangling
content from artifact, our U-DuDoNet directly models the artifact generation
process through additions in both sinogram and image domains, which is
theoretically justified by an additive property associated with metal artifact.
Our design includes a self-learned sinogram prior net, which provides guidance
for restoring the information in the sinogram domain, and cyclic constraints
for artifact reduction and addition on unpaired data. Extensive experiments on
simulation data and clinical images demonstrate that our novel framework
outperforms the state-of-the-art unpaired approaches.

this gap, we study the uniform convergence in the nonlinear random feature

analytical expressions for three quantities in this model: 1) classical uniform
convergence over norm balls, 2) uniform convergence over interpolators in the
norm ball (recently proposed by Zhou et al. (2020)), and 3) the risk of minimum
norm interpolator. We show that, in the setting where the classical uniform
convergence bound is vacuous (diverges to $\infty$), uniform convergence over
the interpolators still gives a non-trivial bound of the test error of
interpolating solutions. We also showcase a different setting where classical
uniform convergence bound is non-vacuous, but uniform convergence over
interpolators can give an improved sample complexity guarantee. Our result
provides a first exact comparison between the test errors and uniform
convergence bounds for interpolators beyond simple linear models.

Theoretical analysis shows that T-SCI returns guaranteed coverage under milder

curve, where the generalization error starts decreasing again after the
interpolation threshold. A series of recent works tried to explain such
phenomenon for simple models. In this work, we analyze the asymptotics of
estimation error in ridge estimators for convolutional linear models. These
convolutional inverse problems, also known as deconvolution, naturally arise in
different fields such as seismology, imaging, and acoustics among others. Our

human parsing, where the try-on images produced by a parser-based method are
used as supervisions to train a ""student"" network without relying on

""teacher-tutor-student"" knowledge distillation, which is able to produce highly

advantages compared to prior arts. (1) Unlike existing work, our approach
treats the fake images produced by the parser-based method as ""tutor

Other than using real images as supervisions, we formulate knowledge
distillation in the try-on problem as distilling the appearance flows between
the person image and the garment image, enabling us to find accurate dense
correspondences between them to produce high-quality results. (3) Extensive
evaluations show large superiority of our method (see Fig. 1).

learning tasks. However, studies show that neural networks are susceptible to
adversarial attacks. This exposes a potential threat to neural network-based
intelligent systems. We observe that the probability of the correct result
outputted by the neural network increases by applying small first-order
perturbations generated for non-predicted class labels to adversarial examples.
Based on this observation, we propose a method for counteracting adversarial
perturbations to improve adversarial robustness. In the proposed method, we
randomly select a number of class labels and generate small first-order
perturbations for these selected labels. The generated perturbations are added
together and then clamped onto a specified space. The obtained perturbation is
finally added to the adversarial example to counteract the adversarial
perturbation contained in the example. The proposed method is applied at
inference time and does not require retraining or finetuning the model. We
experimentally validate the proposed method on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The
results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the defense

strong adversarial examples generated using more iterations.

unanswerable in the real world. In this case, it is significant and challenging
how the model determines when no answer is supported by the passage and

classifier to determine answerability implicitly without explicitly modeling
mutual interaction and relation between the question and passage, leading to
the poor performance for determining the unanswerable questions. To tackle this

explicitly model the mutual interaction and locate key clues from coarse to
fine by introducing a co-interactive relation module. The co-interactive
relation module contains a stack of interaction and fusion blocks to
continuously integrate and fuse history-guided and current-query-guided clues

structural information over different human granularities and eases the
difficulty of person partitioning. Specifically, a dense-to-sparse projection
field, which allows explicitly associating dense human semantics with sparse
keypoints, is learnt and progressively improved over the network feature
pyramid for robustness. Then, the difficult pixel grouping problem is cast as
an easier, multi-person joint assembling task. By formulating joint association
as maximum-weight bipartite matching, a differentiable solution is developed to
exploit projected gradient descent and Dykstra's cyclic projection algorithm.
This makes our method end-to-end trainable and allows back-propagating the
grouping error to directly supervise multi-granularity human representation
learning. This is distinguished from current bottom-up human parsers or pose
estimators which require sophisticated post-processing or heuristic greedy
algorithms. Experiments on three instance-aware human parsing datasets show

crucial role in topological states of quantum matter. In
time-reversal-invariant (TRI) systems, the inversion of spin-degenerate bands
with opposite parity leads to nontrivial topological states, such as
topological insulators and Dirac semimetals. When the TRS is broken, the
exchange field induces spin splitting of the bands. The inversion of a pair of
spin-splitting subbands can generate more exotic topological states, such as
quantum anomalous Hall insulators and magnetic Weyl semimetals. So far, such
topological phase transitions driven by the TRS breaking have not been
visualized. In this work, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
have demonstrated that the TRS breaking induces a band inversion of a pair of
spin-splitting subbands at the TRI points of Brillouin zone in EuB$_6$, when a
long-range ferromagnetic order is developed. The dramatic changes in the
electronic structure result in a topological phase transition from a TRI
ordinary insulator state to a TRS-broken topological semimetal (TSM) state.
Remarkably, the magnetic TSM state has an ideal electronic structure, in which
the band crossings are located at the Fermi level without any interference from
other bands. Our findings not only reveal the topological phase transition
driven by the TRS breaking, but also provide an excellent platform to explore
novel physical behavior in the magnetic topological states of quantum matter.

MLC mainly learns discriminative features with three crucial modules, namely a
multi-scale network, a multi-label learning module, and a self-paced clustering
module. Specifically, the multi-scale network generates multi-granularity
person features in both global and local views. The multi-label learning module
leverages a memory feature bank and assigns each image with a multi-label

multi-label training for several epochs, the self-paced clustering joins in
training and assigns a pseudo label for each image. The benefits of our MLC
come from three aspects: i) the multi-scale person features for better
similarity measurement, ii) the multi-label assignment based on the whole
dataset ensures that every image can be trained, and iii) the self-paced
clustering removes some noisy samples for better feature learning. Extensive
experiments on three popular large-scale Re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that our

$0.8 < z < 1.3$ selected at 16 micron. At the selection wavelength near 8
micron rest, the observed emission comes both from dust heated by intense star
formation and from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Fitting the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of the sample galaxies to local-galaxy templates reveals
that more than half the galaxies have SEDs dominated by star formation. About
one sixth of the galaxy SEDs are dominated by an AGN, and nearly all the rest
of the SEDs are composite. Comparison with X-ray and far-infrared observations
shows that combinations of luminosities at rest-frame 4.5 and 8 micron give
good measures of both AGN luminosity and star-formation rate. The sample
galaxies mostly follow the established star-forming main sequence for $z=1$
galaxies, but of the galaxies more than 0.5 dex above that main sequence, more
than half have AGN-type SEDs. Similarly, the most luminous AGNs tend to have
higher star-formation rates than the main sequence value. Galaxies with stellar
masses $>$10$^{11}$\,\Msun\ are unlikely to host an AGN. About 1% of the sample
galaxies show an SED with dust emission typical of neither star formation nor
an AGN.

introduced by Sheekey in 2016, and a central open problem regards the
classification of those that are exceptional. So far, only two families of
exceptional scattered polynomials are known. Very recently, Longobardi and
Zanella weakened the property of being scattered by introducing the notion of
L-$q^t$-partially scattered and R-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomials, for
$t$ a divisor of $n$. Indeed, a polynomial is scattered if and only if it is
both L-$q^t$-partially scattered and R-$q^t$-partially scattered. In this
paper, by using techniques from algebraic geometry over finite fields and
function fields theory, we show that the property which is is the hardest to be
preserved is the L-$q^t$-partially scattered one. On the one hand, we are able
to extend the classification results of exceptional scattered polynomials to
exceptional L-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomials. On the other hand, the
R-$q^t$-partially scattered property seems more stable. We present a large
family of R-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomials, containing examples of
exceptional R-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomials, which turn out to be
connected with linear sets of so-called pseudoregulus type. In order to detect
new examples of polynomials which are R-$q^t$-partially scattered, we introduce
two different notions of equivalence preserving this property and concerning
natural actions of the groups ${\rm \Gamma L}(2,q^n)$ and ${\rm \Gamma
L}(2n/t,q^t)$. In particular, our family contains many examples of inequivalent
polynomials, and geometric arguments are used to determine the equivalence
classes under the action of ${\rm \Gamma L}(2n/t,q^t)$.

multiports and for matroid pairs. We show the parallel between the two and
study the consequences of this parallel. We present applications to testing,
using purely matroidal methods, whether a connection of rigid multiports yields
a linear network with unique solution. We also indicate that rigidity can be
regarded as the closest notion to duality that can be hoped for, when the
spaces correspond to different physical constraints, such as topological and
device characteristic.
  A multiport is an ordered pair $(\V^1_{AB},\A^2_{B}),$ where $\V^1_{AB}$ is
the solution space on $A\uplus B$ of the Kirchhoff current and voltage
equations of the graph of the multiport and $\A^2_{B}\equivd \alpha_B+\V^2_B$
is the device characteristic of the multiport, with $A$ corresponding to port
voltages and currents and $B$ corresponding to internal voltages and currents.
  The pair $\{\V^1_{AB},\alpha_B+\V^2_{B}\}$ is said to be rigid iff it has a
solution $(x_A,x_B)$ for every vector $\alpha_B$ and given a restriction $x_A$
of the solution, $x_B$ is unique.
  A matroid $\M_S$ on $S,$ is a family of `independent' sets with the property
that maximal independent sets contained in any given subset of $S$ have the
same cardinality.
  The pair $\{\M^1_{AB},\M^2_{B}\}$ is said to be rigid iff the two matroids
have disjoint bases which cover $B.$ We show that the properties of rigid pairs
of matroids closely parallel those of rigid multiports.
  We use the methods developed in the paper to show that a multiport with
independent and controlled sources and positive or negative resistors, whose
parameters can be taken to be algebraically independent over $\Q,$ is rigid, if
certain simple topological conditions are satisfied by the device edges.

proposal in phonon spectra of realistic materials that share an antiperovskite
structure with space group \emph{P}4/\emph{nmm}. Importantly, the neck points
of these hourglass dispersions trace out two nodal rings tangent to four nodal
lines, forming a unique hourglass nodal cage in the bulk Brillouin zone. The
Berry phase analysis reveal the nontrivial topology of these nodal rings and
nodal lines. Furthermore, the nontrivial surface states and isofrequency
surface arcs are visible, facilitating their experimental confirmation of such
exotic quasiparticles. Our work not only offers a new insight into the
hourglass dispersion, but also expands aspects for studying promising
topological quasiparticles in condensed-matter systems.

present in the 6-8 keV range) indicating the presence of massive hot disk winds
in Black Hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XrB) are most generally observed during the
soft states. It has been recently suggested that the non-detection of such hot
wind signatures in the hard states could be due to the thermal instability of
the wind in the ionisation domain consistent with Fe XXV and Fe XXVI. Studying
the wind thermal stability requires however a very good knowledge of the
spectral shape of the ionizing Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). We discuss
in this paper the expected evolution of the disk wind properties during an
entire outburst by using the RXTE observations of GX 339-4 during its 2010-2011
outburst. While GX 339-4 never showed signatures of a hot wind in the X-rays,
the dataset used is optimal to illustrate our purposes. We compute the
corresponding stability curves of the wind using the SED obtained with the
Jet-Emitting Disk model. We show that the disk wind can transit from stable to
unstable states for Fe XXV and Fe XXVI ions on a day time scale. While the
absence of wind absorption features in hard states could be explained by this
instability, their presence in soft states seems to require changes of the wind
properties (e.g. density) during the spectral transitions between hard and soft
states. We propose that these changes could be partly due to the variation of
heating power release at the accretion disk surface through irradiation by the
central X-ray source. The evolution of the disk wind properties discussed in
this paper could be confirmed through the daily monitoring of the spectral
transition of a high-inclination BH XrB.

many fundamental results in the Analysis of Boolean functions, such as the KKL
theorem, Friedgut's junta theorem and the invariance principle. In these
results the cube is equipped with the uniform measure, but it is desirable,
particularly for applications to the theory of sharp thresholds, to also obtain
such results for general $p$-biased measures. However, simple examples show
that when $p = o(1)$, there is no hypercontractive inequality that is strong
enough.
  In this paper, we establish an effective hypercontractive inequality for
general $p$ that applies to `global functions', i.e. functions that are not
significantly affected by a restriction of a small set of coordinates. This
class of functions appears naturally, e.g. in Bourgain's sharp threshold
theorem, which states that such functions exhibit a sharp threshold. We
demonstrate the power of our tool by strengthening Bourgain's theorem, thereby
making progress on a conjecture of Kahn and Kalai and by establishing a
$p$-biased analog of the invariance principle.
  Our results have significant applications in Extremal Combinatorics. Here we
obtain new results on the Tur\'an number of any bounded degree uniform
hypergraph obtained as the expansion of a hypergraph of bounded uniformity.
These are asymptotically sharp over an essentially optimal regime for both the
uniformity and the number of edges and solve a number of open problems in the
area. In particular, we give general conditions under which the crosscut
parameter asymptotically determines the Tur\'an number, answering a question of
Mubayi and Verstra\""ete. We also apply the Junta Method to refine our
asymptotic results and obtain several exact results, including proofs of the
Huang--Loh--Sudakov conjecture on cross matchings and the
F\""uredi--Jiang--Seiver conjecture on path expansions.

class objects using the feature representation learned upon a set of base class
objects. However,an implicit contradiction between novel class classification
and representation is unfortunately ignored. On the one hand, to achieve
accurate novel class classification, the distributions of either two base
classes must be far away fromeach other (max-margin). On the other hand, to
precisely represent novel classes, the distributions of base classes should be
close to each other to reduce the intra-class distance of novel classes
(min-margin). In this paper, we propose a class margin equilibrium (CME)
approach, with the aim to optimize both feature space partition and novel class
reconstruction in a systematic way. CME first converts the few-shot detection
problem to the few-shot classification problem by using a fully connected layer
to decouple localization features. CME then reserves adequate margin space for
novel classes by introducing simple-yet-effective class margin loss during
feature learning. Finally, CME pursues margin equilibrium by disturbing the
features of novel class instances in an adversarial min-max fashion.
Experiments on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets show that CME significantly
improves upon two baseline detectors (up to $3\sim 5\%$ in average), achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

popular method is to obtain pseudo-label by clustering and use them to optimize
the model. Although this kind of approach has shown promising accuracy, it is
hampered by 1) noisy labels produced by clustering and 2) feature variations
caused by camera shift. The former will lead to incorrect optimization and thus
hinders the model accuracy. The latter will result in assigning the intra-class
samples of different cameras to different pseudo-label, making the model
sensitive to camera variations. In this paper, we propose a unified framework
to solve both problems. Concretely, we propose a Dynamic and Symmetric
Cross-Entropy loss (DSCE) to deal with noisy samples and a camera-aware
meta-learning algorithm (MetaCam) to adapt camera shift. DSCE can alleviate the
negative effects of noisy samples and accommodate the change of clusters after
each clustering step. MetaCam simulates cross-camera constraint by splitting
the training data into meta-train and meta-test based on camera IDs. With the
interacted gradient from meta-train and meta-test, the model is enforced to
learn camera-invariant features. Extensive experiments on three re-ID
benchmarks show the effectiveness and the complementary of the proposed DSCE

Other non-magnetic non-volatile memories such as memristors, ferroelectric

costly crystal structural rearrangements to store information. In contrast,
conventional electronic charge states in quantum dots for example, can be
switched in femtoseconds with high efficiency, but any stored information
dissipates rapidly. Here we present a radically different approach in the form
of a charge-configuration memory (CCM) device that relies on
charge-injection-driven electronic crystal melting and topological protection

microscopy (STM) we show microscopically, within an operational device, how
dislocations in the domain ordering lead to metastability by a mechanism that
is topologically equivalent to magnetic bubble memory. The devices have a very

obtain the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. However, the
phenomenon of robust overfitting, i.e., the robustness starts to decrease
significantly during AT, has been problematic, not only making practitioners
consider a bag of tricks for a successful training, e.g., early stopping, but
also incurring a significant generalization gap in the robustness. In this
paper, we propose an effective regularization technique that prevents robust
overfitting by optimizing an auxiliary `consistency' regularization loss during
AT. Specifically, we discover that data augmentation is a quite effective tool
to mitigate the overfitting in AT, and develop a regularization that forces the
predictive distributions after attacking from two different augmentations of
the same instance to be similar with each other. Our experimental results
demonstrate that such a simple regularization technique brings significant
improvements in the test robust accuracy of a wide range of AT methods. More
remarkably, we also show that our method could significantly help the model to
generalize its robustness against unseen adversaries, e.g., other types or
larger perturbations compared to those used during training. Code is available

tensor product B-spline basis functions in space, implicit second order time
integration schemes, residual minimization in every time step, and we exploit
Kronecker product structure of the matrix to employ linear computational cost
alternating direction solver. We implement an implicit time integration scheme
and apply, for each space-direction, a stabilized mixed method based on
residual minimization. We show that the resulting system of linear equations
has a Kronecker product structure, which results in a linear computational cost
of the direct solver, even using implicit time integration schemes together
with the stabilized mixed formulation. We test our method on three
advection-diffusion computational examples, including model ``membrane''
problem, the circular wind problem, and the simulations modeling pollution
propagating from a chimney.

Equivalence principle, and has predictions that come out as a consequence of
the principle, in observables. Testing such observables to find
confirmation/infirmation of the principle have formed a significant chunk of
tests of GR itself. It is expected that quantum corrections to GR may add
additional higher powers of $R$ to the Einstein-Hilbert action, or more
generally, modifying the action into a generic class of functions of the Ricci
scalar. Testing the fate of the prized equivalence principle, in such modified
theories of gravity, hence become important in order to obtain a more generic
theory of gravitation, and consequently, of gravitating objects. In this study,
it is shown that a Post-Newtonian (PN) expansion of a class of $
f\left(R\right) $ theories lead to a sequence of solutions to the two-body

to train personalized models in a collaborative way while accounting for data

approach to this problem using hypernetworks, termed pFedHN for personalized
Federated HyperNetworks. In this approach, a central hypernetwork model is
trained to generate a set of models, one model for each client. This
architecture provides effective parameter sharing across clients, while
maintaining the capacity to generate unique and diverse personal models.
Furthermore, since hypernetwork parameters are never transmitted, this approach
decouples the communication cost from the trainable model size. We test pFedHN
empirically in several personalized federated learning challenges and find that
it outperforms previous methods. Finally, since hypernetworks share information

colors at $0.5 \le z \le 2.5$ in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. After dividing
the galaxy sample into subsamples of red sequence (RS), blue cloud (BC), and
green valley (GV) galaxies in different redshift bins, according to their
rest-frame extinction-corrected UV colors, we derive their lifetimes using
clustering analyses. Several essentials that may influence the lifetime
estimation have been explored, including the dark matter (DM) halo mass
function (HMF), the width of redshift bin, the growth of DM halos within each
redshift bin, and the stellar mass. We find that the HMF difference results in
scatters of $\sim0.2$ dex on lifetime estimation; adopting a redshift bin width
of $\Delta z = 0.5$ is good enough to estimate the lifetime; and no significant
effect on lifetime estimation is found due to the growth of DM halos within
each redshift bin. The galaxy subsamples with higher stellar masses generally
have shorter lifetimes; however, the lifetimes among different subsamples at z
> 1:5 tend to be independent of stellar mass. Consistently, the
clustering-based lifetime for each galaxy subsample agrees well with that
inferred using the spectral energy distribution modeling. Moreover, the
lifetimes of the RS and BC galaxies also coincide well with their typical gas
depletion timescales attributed to the consumption of star formation.
Interestingly, the distinct lifetime behaviors of the GV galaxies at $z \le
1.5$ and $z>1.5$ can not be fully accounted for by their gas depletion
timescales. Instead, this discrepancy between the lifetimes and gas depletion
timescales of the GV galaxies suggests that there are additional physical
processes, such as feedback of active galactic nuclei, accelerating the
quenching of GV galaxies at high redshifts.

and InAs in the form of heterostructured nanowires, with bandgap values down to
0.5 eV, especially important for newly developed structures with unknown
bandgaps. Using complex heterostructured InAs-GaSb nanowires, we determine a
bandgap value of 0.54 eV for wurtzite InAs. Moreover, we directly compare the
bandgaps of wurtzite and zinc-blende polytypes of GaSb in a single
nanostructure, measured here as 0.84 and 0.75 eV, respectively. This allows us
to solve an existing controversy in the band alignment between these structures
arising from theoretical predictions. The findings demonstrate the potential of
monochromated VEELS to provide a better understanding of the band alignment at

coupled power (3 to 13 W). Both experimental measurements and numerical

experimental measurements, while the second focuses on the simulation, a hybrid
model combining a 2D fluid module and a 0D kinetic module. Electron density is
measured by a resonant cavity method. It varies from 0.4 to 5e9 cm-3,
corresponding to ionization degrees from 2e-8 to 4e-7. Ammonia density is
quantified by combining IR absorption and mass spectrometry. It increases
linearly with the amount of H2 (up to 3e13 cm-3 at 5 pct H2). On the contrary,
it is constant with pressure, which suggests the dominance of surface processes
on the formation of ammonia. Positive ions are measured by mass spectrometry.
Nitrogen-bearing ions are hydrogenated by the injection of H2, N2H+ being the
major ion as soon as the amount of H2 is larger than 1 pct. The increase of
pressure leads to an increase of secondary ions formed by ion (or radical) -
neutral collisions (ex: N2H+, NH4+, H3+), while an increase of the coupled
power favours ions formed by direct ionization (ex: N2+, NH3+, H2+).

constant speed $v>0$ of the particle during each running phase is independently
drawn from a probability distribution $W(v)$ and that the direction of the
particle is chosen isotropically after each tumbling. The position distribution
is clearly isotropic, $P(\vec{R},N)\to P(R,N)$ where $R=|\vec{R}|$. We show
that, under certain conditions on $d$ and $W(v)$ and for large $N$, a
condensation transition occurs at some critical value of $R=R_c\sim O(N)$
located in the large deviation regime of $P(R,N)$. For $R<R_c$ (subcritical
fluid phase), all runs are roughly of the same size in a typical trajectory. In
contrast, an RTP trajectory with $R>R_c$ is typically dominated by a
`condensate', i.e., a large single run that subsumes a finite fraction of the
total displacement (supercritical condensed phase). Focusing on the family of
speed distributions $W(v)=\alpha(1-v/v_0)^{\alpha-1}/v_0$, parametrized by
$\alpha>0$, we show that, for large $N$, $P(R,N)\sim
\exp\left[-N\psi_{d,\alpha}(R/N)\right]$ and we compute exactly the rate
function $\psi_{d,\alpha}(z)$ for any $d$ and $\alpha$. We show that the
transition manifests itself as a singularity of this rate function at $R=R_c$
and that its order depends continuously on $d$ and $\alpha$. We also compute
the distribution of the condensate size for $R>R_c$. Finally, we study the
model when the total duration $T$ of the RTP, instead of the total number of
runs, is fixed. Our analytical predictions are confirmed by numerical
simulations, performed using a constrained Markov chain Monte Carlo technique,
with precision $\sim 10^{-100}$.

show that all core developers take breaks (at least once) and about a half of

We also analyzed the probability of transitions to/from inactivity and found
that developers who pause their activity have a ~35-55\% chance to return to an
active state; yet, if the break lasts for a year or longer, then the
probability of resuming activities drops to ~21-26%, with a ~54% chance of

Broadcasting is more powerful in the early stages but may be gradually caught

scaling. For Lebesgue null sets it measures the decay of the Lebesgue measure
of epsilon neighbourhoods of the set. It is well known that self-similar sets,
satisfying reasonable separation conditions and non-log comensurable
contraction ratios, have a well-defined Minkowski content. When dropping the
contraction conditions, the more general notion of average Minkowski content
still exists. For random recursive self-similar sets the Minkowski content also
exists almost surely, whereas for random homogeneous self-similar sets it was
recently shown by Z\""{a}hle that the Minkowski content exists in expectation.
In this short note we show that the upper Minkowski content, as well as the
upper average Minkowski content of random homogeneous self-similar sets is
infinite, almost surely, answering a conjecture posed by Z\""{a}hle.
Additionally, we show that in the random homogeneous equicontractive
self-similar setting the lower Minkowski content is zero and the lower average
Minkowski content is also infinite. These results are in stark contrast to the
random recursive model or the mean behaviour of random homogeneous attractors.

explosion in cataclysmic variables and observe as the binary system relaxes to
quiescence. Methods: We used multi-wavelength time resolved optical and
near-infrared spectroscopy for a bright, well studied classical nova five years
after outburst. We were able to disentangle the contribution of the ejecta at
this late epoch using its previous characterization, separating the ejecta
emission from that of the binary system. Results: We determined the binary
orbital period (P=3.76 hr), the system separation and mass ratio (q>=0.17 for
an assumed white dwarf mass of 1.2 solar masses). We find evidence of an
irradiated secondary star and no unambiguous signature of an accretion disk,
although we identify a second emission line source tied to the white dwarf with
an impact point. The data are consistent with a bloated white dwarf envelope
and the presence of unsettled gas within the white dwarf Roche lobe.
Conclusions: At more than 5 years after eruption, it appears that this
classical nova has not yet relaxed.

experimentally investigate the phase effect in plasmon-exciton coupling systems
consisting of monolayer WSe2 and an individual gold nanorod. The local plasmon
phase delay is tuned by adopting various nanorods with different resonant
energies respective to the exciton. We find that the local plasmon phase delay
between the excitons and the plasmonic modes is as equally essential as the
amplitude. The phase delay modulates the plasmon-exciton coupling considerably,
resulting in an asymmetric spectral line-shape due to the interference
behavior. There is an excellent agreement for the phase delay between the
numerically calculated near-field phase distribution and the experimental
results. The local phase delay can act as an effective way to modulate the
properties of plexcitonic coupling at the nanoscale, which may have potential

before reaching the gate. Moreover, human pilots consistently looked at the
inside of the future flight path for lateral (i.e., left and right turns) and

learning, existing works typically assume that labeled nodes, from two or
multiple classes, are provided, so that a discriminative classifier can be

restrictive for applications, as users may only provide labels of interest in a

we propose a novel graph neural network framework, long-short distance
aggregation networks (LSDAN), to overcome these limitations. By generating

develop a long-short distance attention model to model these graphs. The direct
neighbors are captured via a short-distance attention mechanism, and neighbors
with long distance are captured by a long distance attention mechanism. Two
novel risk estimators are further employed to aggregate long-short-distance
networks, for PU learning and the loss is back-propagated for model learning.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

use an efficient implementation of reverse differentiation, called

biological implausibility (e.g., lack of local update rules for the

predictive coding (PC), a framework for describing information processing in
the brain, are increasingly studied. Recent works prove that these methods can
approximate BP up to a certain margin on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and
asymptotically on any other complex model, and that zero-divergence inference
learning (Z-IL), a variant of PC, is able to exactly implement BP on MLPs.
However, the recent literature shows also that there is no biologically
plausible method yet that can exactly replicate the weight update of BP on
complex models. To fill this gap, in this paper, we generalize (PC and) Z-IL by
directly defining them on computational graphs, and show that it can perform
exact reverse differentiation. What results is the first biologically plausible
algorithm that is equivalent to BP in the way of updating parameters on any

hierarchical tree structure: in each step, gradients are pooled across tasks
clusters, and subsequent steps follow down the tree. We also implement a

scientific fields and they have become particularly crucial nowadays because of
their ability to analyse COVID-19-related data. Models for count data are
needed when the variable of interest take only non-negative integer values and
these integers arise from counting occurrences. Several R-packages are
currently available to deal with spatiotemporal areal count data. Each package
focuses on different models and/or statistical methodologies. Unfortunately,
the results generated by these models are rarely comparable due to differences
in notation and methods. The main objective of this paper is to present a
review describing the most important approaches that can be used to model and
analyse count data when questions of scientific interest concern both their
spatial and their temporal behaviour and we monitor their performance under the
same data set.
  For this review, we focus on the three R-packages that can be used for this
purpose and the different models assessed are representative of the two most
widespread methodologies used to analyse spatiotemporal count data: the
classical approach (based on Penalised Likelihood or Estimating Equations) and
the Bayesian point of view.
  A case study is analysed as an illustration of these different methodologies.
In this case study, these packages are used to model and predict daily
hospitalisations from COVID-19 in 24 health regions within the Valencian
Community (Spain), with data corresponding to the period from 28 June to 13
December 2020. Because of the current urgent need for monitoring and predicting

importance and can be considered the secondary objective of this work.

in these two spacetimes which qualitatively distinguish them from Polish
doughnuts in the Schwarzschild spacetime. As a main result we find that, for
both metrics, there is a range of positive (Geroch-Hansen) quadrupole moments
which allows for the existence of double tori. If these double tori fill their
Roche lobes completely, their meridional cross-section has the shape of a fish,
with the body of the fish corresponding to the outer torus and the fish-tail
corresponding to the inner torus. Such double tori do not exist in the

poor generalization when applied to unseen image domains, and require expensive
cost of annotation especially for dense pixel prediction tasks such as semantic
segmentation. Recently, both unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from large
amounts of synthetic data and semi-supervised learning (SSL) with small set of
labeled data have been studied to alleviate this issue. However, there is still
a large gap on performance compared to their supervised counterparts. We focus
on a more practical setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) where
both a small set of labeled target data and large amounts of labeled source
data are available. To address the task of SSDA, a novel framework based on
dual-level domain mixing is proposed. The proposed framework consists of three
stages. First, two kinds of data mixing methods are proposed to reduce domain
gap in both region-level and sample-level respectively. We can obtain two
complementary domain-mixed teachers based on dual-level mixed data from
holistic and partial views respectively. Then, a student model is learned by
distilling knowledge from these two teachers. Finally, pseudo labels of
unlabeled data are generated in a self-training manner for another few rounds
of teachers training. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed framework on synthetic-to-real semantic
segmentation benchmarks.

range of areas such as curriculum learning or automated planning, it has mostly
been tied to transfer learning. Transfer is based on the idea of reusing the
knowledge acquired in the learning of a set of source tasks to a new learning
process in a target task, assuming that the target and source tasks are close
enough. In recent years, transfer learning has succeeded in making
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms more efficient (e.g., by reducing the
number of samples needed to achieve the (near-)optimal performance). Transfer
in RL is based on the core concept of similarity: whenever the tasks are
similar, the transferred knowledge can be reused to solve the target task and
significantly improve the learning performance. Therefore, the selection of
good metrics to measure these similarities is a critical aspect when building
transfer RL algorithms, especially when this knowledge is transferred from
simulation to the real world. In the literature, there are many metrics to
measure the similarity between MDPs, hence, many definitions of similarity or
its complement distance have been considered. In this paper, we propose a
categorization of these metrics and analyze the definitions of similarity
proposed so far, taking into account such categorization. We also follow this
taxonomy to survey the existing literature, as well as suggesting future
directions for the construction of new metrics.

the one-way transfer between teacher and student networks, an ensemble of
dual-task students can learn collaboratively and implicitly explore useful
knowledge from each other during the training process. By jointly learning the
segmentation probability maps and signed distance maps of targets, our
framework can enforce the geometric shape constraint and learn more reliable

performance gains by leveraging unlabeled data and outperforms the

methods have become ubiquitous in Bayesian imaging. These methods derive
Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) or Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimators for
inverse problems in imaging by combining an explicit likelihood function with a
prior that is implicitly defined by an image denoising algorithm. The PnP
algorithms proposed in the literature mainly differ in the iterative schemes
they use for optimisation or for sampling. In the case of optimisation schemes,
some recent works guarantee the convergence to a fixed point, albeit not
necessarily a MAP estimate. In the case of sampling schemes, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no known proof of convergence. There also remain important
open questions regarding whether the underlying Bayesian models and estimators
are well defined, well-posed, and have the basic regularity properties required
to support these numerical schemes. To address these limitations, this paper
develops theory, methods, and provably convergent algorithms for performing
Bayesian inference with PnP priors. We introduce two algorithms: 1) PnP-ULA
(Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm) for Monte Carlo sampling and MMSE inference;
and 2) PnP-SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) for MAP inference. Using recent
results on the quantitative convergence of Markov chains, we establish detailed
convergence guarantees for these two algorithms under realistic assumptions on
the denoising operators used, with special attention to denoisers based on deep
neural networks. We also show that these algorithms approximately target a
decision-theoretically optimal Bayesian model that is well-posed. The proposed
algorithms are demonstrated on several canonical problems such as image
deblurring, inpainting, and denoising, where they are used for point estimation
as well as for uncertainty visualisation and quantification.

has been a powerful driving force for scientific research into methods that
might underpin drag-reducing technologies for a variety of vehicular transport
on roads, by rail, in the air, and on or in the water. In civil aviation,
skin-friction drag accounts for around 50% of the total drag in cruise
conditions, thus being a preferential target for research. With laminar
conditions excluded, skin friction is intimately linked to the turbulence
physics in the fluid layer closest to the skin. Thus, research into drag
reduction has focused on methods to depress the turbulence activity near the
surface. The most effective method of doing so is to subject the drag-producing
flow in the near-wall layer to an unsteady and/or spatially varying cross-flow
component, either by the action of transverse wall oscillations, by embedding
rotating discs into the surface or by plasma-producing electrodes that
accelerate the near-wall fluid in the transverse direction. In ideal
conditions, drag-reduction margins of order of 50% can be achieved. The present
article provides a review of research into the response of turbulent near-wall
layers to the imposition of unsteady and wavy transverse motion, encompassing
experiments, simulation, analysis and modelling. It covers issues such as the
drag-reduction margin in a variety of actuation scenarios, the underlying
physical phenomena that contribute to the interpretation of the origin of the
drag reduction, the dependence of the drag reduction on the Reynolds number,
passive control methods that are inspired by active control, and a forward look
towards possible future research and practical realizations. The authors hope
that this review, by far the most extensive of its kind for this subject, will

but is limited in its ability to consider severe uncertainty in knowledge, and
value ambiguity in management objectives. We study the use of robust Bayesian
decision analysis to handle problems where one or both of these issues arise.
The robust Bayesian approach models severe uncertainty through bounds on
probability distributions, and value ambiguity through bounds on utility
functions. To incorporate data, standard Bayesian updating is applied on the
entire set of distributions. To elicit our expert's utility representing the
value of different management objectives, we use a modified version of the
swing weighting procedure that can cope with severe value ambiguity. We
demonstrate these methods on an environmental management problem to eradicate
an alien invasive marmorkrebs recently discovered in Sweden, which needed a
rapid response despite substantial knowledge gaps if the species was still
present (i.e. severe uncertainty) and the need for difficult tradeoffs and
competing interests (i.e. value ambiguity). We identify that the decision
alternatives to drain the system and remove individuals in combination with
dredging and sieving with or without a degradable biocide, or increasing pH,
are consistently bad under the entire range of probability and utility bounds.
This case study shows how robust Bayesian decision analysis provides a
transparent methodology for integrating information in risk management problems
where little data are available and/or where the tradeoffs ambiguous.

the optimal scheduling of integrated demand response (IDR)-enabled integrated
energy systems with uncertain renewable generations, where the IEO acts as the
leader who pursues the maximization of his profits by setting energy prices,
while the users are the follower who adjusts energy consumption plans to
minimize their energy costs. Taking into account the inherent uncertainty of
renewable generations, the probabilistic spinning reserve is written in the
form of a chance constraint; in addition, a district heating network model is
built considering the characteristics of time delay and thermal attenuation by
fully exploiting its potential, and the flexible thermal comfort requirements
of users in IDR are considered by introducing a predicted mean vote (PMV)
index. To solve the raised model, sequence operation theory is introduced to
convert the chance constraint into its deterministic equivalent form, and
thereby, the leader-follower Stackelberg game is tackled into a mixed-integer
quadratic programming formulation through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality
conditions and is finally solved by the CPLEX optimizer. The results of two
case studies demonstrate that the proposed Stackelberg game-based approach
manages to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium between IEO and users by the
coordination of renewable generations and IDR. Furthermore, the study on a real
integrated energy system in China verifies the applicability of the proposed
approach for real-world applications.

We consider two forms of decision aid: recommending which labels to map

studies, we find that 18 clinicians generally build intuition of when to rely
on automation and when to exercise their own judgement. However, when presented
with fully pre-populated suggestions, these expert users exhibit less agency:
accepting improper mentions, and taking less initiative in creating additional

leave the cohort each day. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We derive
conditions under which our problem satisfies indexability, a precondition that
guarantees the existence and asymptotic optimality of the Whittle Index
solution for RMABs. We establish the conditions using a polytime reduction of
the Streaming Bandit setup to regular RMABs. (2) We further prove a phenomenon

lowering the computational complexity compared to existing methods. (4)

in imposing low-rank constraints on the feasible set of couplings considered in

most pronounced features inside solar wind transients. The technique was
applied to events including a coronal mass ejection (CME) and three small-scale
transients, so-called blobs, observed by HI1 on 3-4 April 2010 to reconstruct
their radial velocity maps. The results match the forward-modeling results,

ejecta varies in the range of 0.7 - 1.0 at heliocentric distance between 25 Rs

main result is to construct the `codimension $2$ transfer' map from the
Higson-Roe analytic surgery exact sequence of a manifold $M$ to that of its
codimension $2$ submanifold $N$ under some assumptions on homotopy groups. This
map sends the primary and secondary higher index invariants of $M$ to those of
$N$. The second is to establish that the codimension 2 transfer map is adjoint
to the co-transfer map in cyclic cohomology, defined by the cup product with a
group cocycle. This relates the Connes-Moscovici higher index pairing and
Lott's higher $\rho$-number of $M$ with those of $N$.

type of resonator, great efforts are being devoted to improving the

Here, we report on an optical resonator based on Tamm modes newly applied to

demonstrating a high-quality factor of 230 at $\sim$1 THz. We further
experimentally and theoretically show a fine-tuning of the Tamm mode frequency

structuration of the metallic layer. Electromagnetic simulations also reveal
that THz Tamm modes are confined over a $\lambda$/2 length within the
distributed Bragg reflector and can be ideally coupled to both bulk materials

building blocks of lasers, for the development of advanced THz optoelectronic

Hooge-like parameter {\alpha} which allows to compare the low-frequency

the sensor are characterized in the parallel state and at 0 mT. We observe that
the sensitivity shows a strong voltage dependence and the noise presents an
unexpected decrease, not anticipated by the Hooge's law. Moreover,
surprisingly, an almost stable detectivity (140-200 nT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz and
15-20 nT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 kHz) as a function of the bias voltage is observed,
tending to highlight that the variation of sensitivity and noise are
correlated. Even if the I-V curves are strongly non-linear and reflect the
different symmetries of the conduction bands channels, the variations in
sensitivity and noise seems to depend mainly on the distortion of the MgO
barrier due to bias voltage. With a simple model where the normal noise and

parabolic conductance with voltage, we describe the behavior of noise and

electrolytes that have shown much promise in replacing organic electrolytes in
lithium-ion batteries. At the extremely high salt concentrations of WiSEs,
ionic association is more complicated than the simple ion pair description. In
fact, large branched clusters can be present in WiSEs, and past a critical salt
concentration, an infinite percolating ionic network can form spontaneously. In
this work, we simplify our recently developed thermodynamic model of reversible
ionic aggregation and gelation, tailoring it specifically for WiSEs. Our
simplified theory only has a handful of parameters, all of which can be readily
determined from simulations. Our model is able to quantitatively reproduce the
populations of ionic clusters of different sizes as a function of salt
concentration, the critical salt concentration for ionic gelation, and the
fraction of ions incorporated into the ionic gel, as observed from molecular
simulations of three different lithium-based WiSEs. The extent of ionic
association and gelation greatly affects the effective ionic strength of
solution, the coordination environment of active cations that is known to
govern the chemistry of the solid-electrolyte interface, and the thermodynamic

difficulty of reasoning over obstacles which greatly increases the
computational time to generate high-quality collision-free grasps. In this work
we address such limitations by introducing DDGC, a fast generative multi-finger

from a single RGB-D image. DDGC is built as a network that encodes scene
information to produce coarse-to-fine collision-free grasp poses and
configurations. We experimentally benchmark DDGC against the
simulated-annealing planner in GraspIt! on 1200 simulated cluttered scenes and
7 real world scenes. The results show that DDGC outperforms the baseline on
synthesizing high-quality grasps and removing clutter while being 5 times
faster. This, in turn, opens up the door for using multi-finger grasps in
practical applications which has so far been limited due to the excessive
computation time needed by other methods.

reflection, have appeared as a promising method to enhance wireless systems. In
this paper, we propose to use an RIS as a spatial equalizer to address the
well-known multi-path fading phenomenon. By introducing some controllable paths
artificially against the multi-path fading through the RIS, we can perform
equalization during the transmission process instead of at the receiver, and
thus all the users can share the same equalizer. Unlike the beamforming
application of the RIS, which aims to maximize the received energy at
receivers, the objective of the equalization application is to reduce the
inter-symbol interference (ISI), which makes phase shifts at the RIS different.
To this end, we formulate the phase shift optimization problem and propose an
iterative algorithm to solve it. Simulation results show that the multi-path
fading effect can be eliminated effectively compared to benchmark schemes.

effects. We propose a causal reduction method that, given a causal model,
replaces an arbitrary number of possibly high-dimensional latent confounders
with a single latent confounder that takes values in the same space as the
treatment variable, without changing the observational and interventional
distributions the causal model entails. This allows us to estimate the causal
effect in a principled way from combined data without relying on the common but
often unrealistic assumption that all confounders have been observed. We apply
our causal reduction in three different settings. In the first setting, we
assume the treatment and outcome to be discrete. The causal reduction then
implies bounds between the observational and interventional distributions that
can be exploited for estimation purposes. In certain cases with highly
unbalanced observational samples, the accuracy of the causal effect estimate
can be improved by incorporating observational data. Second, for continuous
variables and assuming a linear-Gaussian model, we derive equality constraints
for the parameters of the observational and interventional distributions.
Third, for the general continuous setting (possibly nonlinear and
non-Gaussian), we parameterize the reduced causal model using normalizing
flows, a flexible class of easily invertible nonlinear transformations. We
perform a series of experiments on synthetic data and find that in several
cases the number of interventional samples can be reduced when adding
observational training samples without sacrificing accuracy.

a bath of colored noise. The parameter of the expansion is the ratio of the
colored noise timescale to the precession period. In the process we obtain the
Gilbert damping from the same expansion. We recover the known results, when the
coefficients of the two terms are proportional to one another, in the white
noise limit; and show how colored noise leads to situations where this simple
relation breaks down, but what replaces it can be understood by the appropriate
generalization of the fluctuation--dissipation theorem. Numerical simulations
of the stochastic equations support the analytic approach. In particular we
find that the equilibration time is about an order of magnitude longer than the
timescale set by the colored noise for a wide range of values of the latter and
we can identify the presence of nutation in the non-uniform way the
magnetization approaches equilibrium.

perceptually align the 2D image features to the 3D shape priors with
cross-modal semantic contrastive mapping; (3) Mold: reconstruct stereo-shape of

current IoT security landscape, which requires a robust network intrusion
detection system (NIDS). Despite superior detection accuracy, existing machine
learning or deep learning based NIDS are vulnerable to adversarial examples.
Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a prevailing
method in adversarial examples crafting. However, the nature of discrete
network traffic at the packet level makes it hard for GAN to craft adversarial
traffic as GAN is efficient in generating continuous data like image synthesis.
Unlike previous methods that convert discrete network traffic into a grayscale
image, this paper gains inspiration from SeqGAN in sequence generation with
policy gradient. Based on the structure of SeqGAN, we propose Attack-GAN to
generate adversarial network traffic at packet level that complies with domain
constraints. Specifically, the adversarial packet generation is formulated into
a sequential decision making process. In this case, each byte in a packet is
regarded as a token in a sequence. The objective of the generator is to select
a token to maximize its expected end reward. To bypass the detection of NIDS,
the generated network traffic and benign traffic are classified by a black-box
NIDS. The prediction results returned by the NIDS are fed into the
discriminator to guide the update of the generator. We generate malicious
adversarial traffic based on a real public available dataset with attack
functionality unchanged. The experimental results validate that the generated
adversarial samples are able to deceive many existing black-box NIDS.

assessments on Bayesian occupancy grids cannot yield risks with meaningful
physical units. In this article, we propose an alternative framework called
Dynamic Lambda-Field that is able to assess generic physical risks in dynamic

at each pixel are distributed across as many as 200 energy channels,
energy-selective images are characterised by low count-rates and poor
signal-to-noise ratio. This means high X-ray exposures, long scan times and
high doses are required to image unique spectral markers. Here, we achieve high
quality energy-dispersive tomograms from low dose, noisy datasets using a
dedicated iterative reconstruction algorithm. This exploits the spatial
smoothness and inter-channel structural correlation in the spectral domain
using two carefully chosen regularisation terms. For a multi-phase phantom, a
reduction in scan time of 36 times is demonstrated. Spectral analysis methods

long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment consisting of a high-power,
broadband neutrino beam, a highly capable near detector located on site at
Fermilab, in Batavia, Illinois, and a massive liquid argon time projection
chamber (LArTPC) far detector located at the 4850L of Sanford Underground
Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. The long-baseline physics sensitivity
calculations presented in the DUNE Physics TDR, and in a related physics paper,
rely upon simulation of the neutrino beam line, simulation of neutrino
interactions in the near and far detectors, fully automated event
reconstruction and neutrino classification, and detailed implementation of
systematic uncertainties. The purpose of this posting is to provide a
simplified summary of the simulations that went into this analysis to the
community, in order to facilitate phenomenological studies of long-baseline
oscillation at DUNE. Simulated neutrino flux files and a GLoBES configuration
describing the far detector reconstruction and selection performance are
included as ancillary files to this posting. A simple analysis using these
configurations in GLoBES produces sensitivity that is similar, but not
identical, to the official DUNE sensitivity. DUNE welcomes those interested in
performing phenomenological work as members of the collaboration, but also
recognizes the benefit of making these configurations readily available to the
wider community.

conservation, arranges vanishing $\bar{\theta}$ at tree-level and requires
vector-like quarks (VLQs) to transmit the CP breaking to the SM. We analyze the
flavor constraints coming from the presence of one such down type VLQ of NB
type by performing a global fit on the relevant flavor observables. A
comparison is made to the case of one generic VLQ. We find that the allowed
parameter space for the VLQ Yukawa couplings and the mixing to the SM are
confined to a region much smaller than in the generic case, making the NB case
falsifiable in principle.

  the Royal Astronomical Society",,"10.1093/mnras/stab790",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have used the central 44 antennas of the new 64-dish MeerKAT radio
telescope array to conduct a deep search for new pulsars in the core of nine
globular clusters. This has led to the discovery of eight new millisecond
pulsars in six different clusters. Two new binaries, 47 Tuc ac and 47 Tuc ad,
are eclipsing ""spiders"", featuring compact orbits ($\lesssim 0.32$ days), very
low-mass companions and regular occultations of their pulsed emission. The
other three new binary pulsars (NGC 6624G, M62G, and Ter 5 an) are in wider ($>
0.7$ days) orbits, with companions that are likely to be white dwarfs or
neutron stars. NGC 6624G has a large eccentricity of $e\simeq 0.38$, which
enabled us to detect the rate of advance of periastron. This suggests that the
system is massive, with a total mass of $M{\rm tot} = 2.65 \pm 0.07$
M$_{\odot}$. Likewise, for Ter 5 an, with $e \simeq 0.0066$, we obtain $M{\rm
tot}= 2.97 \pm 0.52$ M$_{\odot}$. The other three new discoveries (NGC 6522D,
NGC 6624H and NGC 6752F) are faint isolated pulsars. Finally, we have used the
whole MeerKAT array and synthesized 288 beams, covering an area of $\sim2$
arcmin in radius around the center of NGC 6624. This has allowed us to localize
many of the pulsars in the cluster, demonstrating the beamforming capabilities
of the TRAPUM software backend and paving the way for the upcoming MeerKAT
globular cluster pulsar survey.

luminosity-star formation rate (SFR) calibrations. In preparation for the new
generation of radio surveys we revisit the IRRC of low-$z$ galaxies by (a)
drawing on the best currently available IR and 1.4 GHz radio photometry, plus
ancillary data over the widest possible area, and (b) carefully assessing
potential systematics. We compile a catalogue of $\sim$9,500 z $<$ 0.2 galaxies
and derive their 1.4 GHz radio ($L_{\mathrm{1.4}}$), total IR, and
monochromatic IR luminosities in up to seven bands, allowing us to parameterize
the wavelength-dependence of monochromatic IRRCs from 22-500 $\mu$m. For the
first time for low-$z$ samples, we quantify how poorly matched IR and radio
survey depths bias measured median IR/radio ratios,
$\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$, and discuss the level of biasing expected for
low-z IRRC studies in ASKAP/MeerKAT fields. For our subset of $\sim$2,000
high-confidence star-forming galaxies we find a median
$\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ of 2.54 (scatter: 0.17 dex). We show that
$\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ correlates with $L_{\mathrm{1.4}}$, implying a
non-linear IRRC with slope 1.11$\pm$0.01. Our new $L_{\mathrm{1.4}}$-SFR
calibration, which incorporates this non-linearity, reproduces SFRs from
panchromatic SED fits substantially better than previous IRRC-based recipes.
Finally, we match the evolutionary slope of recently measured
$\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$-redshift trends without having to invoke redshift
evolution of the IRRC. In this framework, the redshift evolution of
$\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ reported at GHz frequencies in the literature is
the consequence of a partial, redshift-dependent sampling of a non-linear IRRC
obeyed by low-$z$ {\it and} distant galaxies.

resources in various quantum information processing tasks. However, there still
lacks an efficient and scalable way to detecting these useful features,
especially for high-dimensional and multipartite quantum systems. In this work,
we exploit the convexity of samples without the desired quantum features and
design an unsupervised machine learning method to detect the presence of such
features as anomalies. Particularly, in the context of entanglement detection,
we propose a complex-valued neural network composed of pseudo-siamese network
and generative adversarial net, and then train it with only separable states to
construct non-linear witnesses for entanglement. It is shown via numerical
examples, ranging from two-qubit to ten-qubit systems, that our network is able
to achieve high detection accuracy which is above 97.5% on average.Moreover, it
is capable of revealing rich structures of entanglement, such as partial
entanglement among subsystems. Our results are readily applicable to the
detection of other quantum resources such as Bell nonlocality and steerability,
and thus our work could provide a powerful tool to extract quantum features

the analysis of the temperature dependent resistivity in TBG. It is a
well-established theoretical result that the Bloch-Gr\""uneisen equation
power-law exponent, n, exhibits exact integer values for certain mechanisms.
For instance, n=5 implies the electron-phonon interaction, n=3 is associated
with electron-magnon interaction and n=2 applies to the electron-electron
interaction. Here we interpret the linear temperature-dependent resistance,
widely observed in TBG, as n$\rightarrow$1, which implies the quasielastic
charge interaction with acoustic phonons. Thus, we fitted TBG resistance curves
to the Bloch-Gr\""uneisen equation, where we propose that n is a free-fitting
parameter. We found that TBGs have a smoothly varied n-value (ranging from 1.4
to 4.4) depending on the Moir\'e superlattice constant, $\lambda$, or the
charge carrier concentration. This implies that different mechanisms smoothly
transition from one to another. The proposed generalized Bloch-Gr\""uneisen

to the segmentation of medical images. Semi-supervised learning seeks to
overcome this limitation by exploiting unlabeled examples in the learning
process. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation method
that leverages mutual information (MI) on categorical distributions to achieve
both global representation invariance and local smoothness. In this method, we
maximize the MI for intermediate feature embeddings that are taken from both
the encoder and decoder of a segmentation network. We first propose a global MI
loss constraining the encoder to learn an image representation that is
invariant to geometric transformations. Instead of resorting to
computationally-expensive techniques for estimating the MI on continuous
feature embeddings, we use projection heads to map them to a discrete cluster
assignment where MI can be computed efficiently. Our method also includes a
local MI loss to promote spatial consistency in the feature maps of the decoder
and provide a smoother segmentation. Since mutual information does not require
a strict ordering of clusters in two different assignments, we incorporate a
final consistency regularization loss on the output which helps align the
cluster labels throughout the network. We evaluate the method on four
challenging publicly-available datasets for medical image segmentation.
Experimental results show our method to outperform recently-proposed approaches
for semi-supervised segmentation and provide an accuracy near to full
supervision while training with very few annotated images.

that polarisation is caused by scattering of thermal radiation. Most of the
dust models that are used to explain these observations have major drawbacks:
They either use much smaller grains than expected from dust evolution models,
or result in lower polarisations than observed. We investigate the effect of
dust grain porosity on the polarisation due to scattering at sub-mm wavelengths
arising from grains of up to mm sizes, as they are expected to be present in
the midplane of PPDs. Using the effective medium theory, we calculated the
optical properties of porous dust and used them to predict the behaviour of the
scattering polarisation. Subsequently, radiative transfer simulations for PPDs
with porous dust were performed to analyse the additional effect of the optical
depth structure, and thus the effect of multiple scattering events and
inhomogeneous temperature distributions on the polarisation. We find that
porous dust with moderate filling factors of about 10\% increase the
polarisation compared to compact grains. For higher grain porosities, that is,
grains with a filling factor of 1\% or lower, the extinction opacity decreases,
as does the optical depth of a disk with constant mass. Consequently, the
unpolarised direct radiation dominates the scattered flux, and the polarisation
drops rapidly. Even though the simulated polarisation is higher than in the
case of compact grains, it is still below the typical observed values for
face-on disks. However, the polarisation can be increased when crucial model
assumptions derived from disk and dust evolution theories, for instance, dust
settling and mm-sized dust grains, are dropped. In the case of inclined disks,
however, our reference model is able to achieve polarisation degrees of about
1\%, and using higher disk masses, even higher than this.

Previous approaches would require preventative cross-replica coordination, or
totally order move operations after-the-fact, requiring roll-back and
compensation operations. In this paper, we present a novel replicated tree that
supports coordination-free concurrent atomic moves, and provably maintains the
tree invariant. Our analysis identifies cases where concurrent moves are
inherently safe, and we devise a lightweight, coordination-free, rollback-free

re-ranking stages going through quick technique shifts during past decades, the
first-stage retrieval has long been dominated by classical term-based models.
Unfortunately, these models suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, which
may block re-ranking stages from relevant documents at the very beginning.
Therefore, it has been a long-term desire to build semantic models for the
first-stage retrieval that can achieve high recall efficiently. Recently, we
have witnessed an explosive growth of research interests on the first-stage
semantic retrieval models. We believe it is the right time to survey current
status, learn from existing methods, and gain some insights for future
development. In this paper, we describe the current landscape of the
first-stage retrieval models under a unified framework to clarify the

efficiency of urban transportation networks. The current work investigates the
spatial properties of congestion, that is, we aim to characterize the city
areas where traffic bottlenecks occur. The analysis of a large amount of real
road networks in previous works showed that congestion points experience
spatial abrupt transitions, namely they shift away from the city center as
larger urban areas are incorporated. The fundamental ingredient behind this
effect is the entanglement of central and arterial roads, embedded in separated
geographical regions. In this paper we extend the analysis of the conditions
yielding abrupt transitions of congestion location. First, we look into the
more realistic situation in which arterial and central roads, rather than lying
on sharply separated regions, present spatial overlap. It results that this
affects the position of bottlenecks and introduces new possible congestion
areas. Secondly, we pay particular attention to the role played by the edge
distribution, proving that it allows to smooth the transitions profile, and so
to control the congestion displacement. Finally, we show that the
aforementioned phenomenology may be recovered also as a consequence of a
discontinuity in the nodes density, in a domain with uniform connectivity. Our
results provide useful insights for the design and optimization of urban road

Their crimped structure and parallel arrangement within the tendon lead to a
distinctive non-linear stress-strain curve when a tendon is stretched.
Microstructural models can be used to relate microscale collagen fibril
mechanics to macroscale tendon mechanics, allowing us to identify the
mechanisms behind each feature present in the stress-strain curve. Most models
in the literature focus on the elastic behaviour of the tendon, and there are
few which model beyond the elastic limit without introducing phenomenological
parameters. We develop a model, built upon a collagen recruitment approach,
that only contains microstructural parameters. We split the stress in the
fibrils into elastic and plastic parts, and assume that the fibril yield
stretch and rupture stretch are each described by a distribution function,
rather than being single-valued. By changing the shapes of the distributions
and their regions of overlap, we can produce macroscale tendon stress-strain
curves that generate the full range of features observed experimentally,
including those that could not be explained using existing models. These
features include second linear regions occurring after the tendon has yielded,
and step-like failure behaviour present after the stress has peaked. When we
compare with an existing model, we find that our model reduces the average root
mean squared error from 4.15MPa to 1.61MPa, and the resulting parameter values
are closer to those found experimentally. Since our model contains only
parameters that have a direct physical interpretation, it can be used to
predict how processes such as ageing, disease, and injury affect the mechanical
behaviour of tendons, provided we can quantify the effects of these processes
on the microstructure.

Procedural Content Generation, which procedurally generates and tests
previously unseen environments with an auxiliary input as a control variable.
Training RL agents over novel environments is a notoriously difficult task. One
popular approach is to procedurally generate different environments to increase
the generalizability of the trained agents. ARLPCG instead deploys an
adversarial model with one PCG RL agent (called Generator) and one solving RL
agent (called Solver). The Generator receives a reward signal based on the
Solver's performance, which encourages the environment design to be challenging
but not impossible. To further drive diversity and control of the environment
generation, we propose using auxiliary inputs for the Generator. The benefit is
two-fold: Firstly, the Solver achieves better generalization through the
Generator's generated challenges. Secondly, the trained Generator can be used
as a creator of novel environments that, together with the Solver, can be shown
to be solvable. We create two types of 3D environments to validate our model,
representing two popular game genres: a third-person platformer and a racing
game. In these cases, we shows that ARLPCG has a significantly better solve
ratio, and that the auxiliary inputs renders the levels creation controllable
to a certain degree. For a video compilation of the results please visit

with \textit{iSpec}, \textit{Turbospectrum}, \textit{MARCS} models atmospheres
and a custom made line list including over 1 000 000 water lines, are compared
to APOGEE observations, and parameters are determined through $\chi^2$
minimization. Spectroscopic parameters ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $[M/H]$, $\log g$,
$v_{mic}$) are presented for a sample of 313 M dwarfs, obtained from their
APOGEE H-band spectra. The generated synthetic spectra reproduce observed
spectra to a high accuracy level. The impact of the spectra normalization on
the results are analyzed as well. Our output parameters are compared with the
ones obtained with APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline
(ASPCAP) for the same stellar spectrum, and we find that the values agree
within the expected uncertainties. Comparisons with other previous
near-infrared and optical literature are also available, with median
differences within our estimated uncertainties found in most cases. Possible
reasons for these differences are explored. The full H-band line list, the line
selection for the synthesis, and the synthesized spectra are available for

performance of candidate architectures. Existing methods either directly use
the validation performance or learn a predictor to estimate the performance.
However, these methods can be either computationally expensive or very
inaccurate, which may severely affect the search efficiency and performance.
Moreover, as it is very difficult to annotate architectures with accurate
performance on specific tasks, learning a promising performance predictor is
often non-trivial due to the lack of labeled data. In this paper, we argue that
it may not be necessary to estimate the absolute performance for NAS. On the
contrary, we may need only to understand whether an architecture is better than
a baseline one. However, how to exploit this comparison information as the
reward and how to well use the limited labeled data remains two great
challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Neural Architecture

comparison results between architectures as the reward. Specifically, we design
and learn a Neural Architecture Comparator (NAC) to compute the probability of
candidate architectures being better than a baseline one. Moreover, we present

learning manner. More critically, we theoretically show that learning NAC is
equivalent to optimizing the ranking over architectures. Extensive experiments

arriving time, is added to traditional MVT with a simple peak sampling circuit.
Secondly, an amplitude deviation statistical analysis, which compares the
energy deviation of various reconstruction models, is used to select adaptive
reconstruction models for signal pulses with different amplitudes. After
processing 30,000 randomly-chosen pulses sampled by the oscilloscope with a
22Na point source, our method achieves an energy resolution of 17.50% within a
450-650 KeV energy window, which is 2.44% better than the result of traditional
MVT with same thresholds; and we get a count number at 15225 in the same energy
window while the result of MVT is at 14678. When the PP-MVT involves less
thresholds than traditional MVT, the advantages of better energy resolution and
larger count number can still be maintained, which shows the robustness and the
flexibility of PP-MVT Digitizer. This improved method indicates that adding

  Devices","9 pages, 6 figures, accepted to tinyML 2021 Research Symposium",,,,"cs.LG cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has emerged as a new light-weight learning
algorithm with smaller computation and energy requirements compared to
conventional techniques. In HDC, data points are represented by
high-dimensional vectors (hypervectors), which are mapped to high-dimensional
space (hyperspace). Typically, a large hypervector dimension ($\geq1000$) is
required to achieve accuracies comparable to conventional alternatives.
However, unnecessarily large hypervectors increase hardware and energy costs,
which can undermine their benefits. This paper presents a technique to minimize
the hypervector dimension while maintaining the accuracy and improving the
robustness of the classifier. To this end, we formulate the hypervector design
as a multi-objective optimization problem for the first time in the literature.
The proposed approach decreases the hypervector dimension by more than
$32\times$ while maintaining or increasing the accuracy achieved by
conventional HDC. Experiments on a commercial hardware platform show that the
proposed approach achieves more than one order of magnitude reduction in model
size, inference time, and energy consumption. We also demonstrate the trade-off
between accuracy and robustness to noise and provide Pareto front solutions as
a design parameter in our hypervector design.

  Electronic Medical Records",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During an infectious disease pandemic, it is critical to share electronic
medical records or models (learned from these records) across regions. Applying
one region's data/model to another region often have distribution shift issues
that violate the assumptions of traditional machine learning techniques.
Transfer learning can be a solution. To explore the potential of deep transfer
learning algorithms, we applied two data-based algorithms (domain adversarial
neural networks and maximum classifier discrepancy) and model-based transfer
learning algorithms to infectious disease detection tasks. We further studied
well-defined synthetic scenarios where the data distribution differences
between two regions are known. Our experiments show that, in the context of
infectious disease classification, transfer learning may be useful when (1) the
source and target are similar and the target training data is insufficient and
(2) the target training data does not have labels. Model-based transfer
learning works well in the first situation, in which case the performance
closely matched that of the data-based transfer learning models. Still, further
investigation of the domain shift in real world research data to account for
the drop in performance is needed.

characterizing the ultrafast pulse in optics, analytic signals are often
considered in time-frequency analysis and signal processing, especially when
extracting instantaneous features of events. In this paper we examine the phase
retrieval (PR) problem of analytic signals in $\Bbb{C}^N$ by their FROG
measurements. After establishing the ambiguity of the FROG-PR of analytic
signals, we found that the FROG-PR of analytic signals of even lengths is
different from that of analytic signals of odd lengths, and it is also
different from the case of $B$-bandlimited signals with $B \leq N/2$. The
existing approach to bandlimited signals can be applied to analytic signals of
odd lengths, but it does not apply to the even length case. With the help of
two relaxed FROG-PR problems and a translation technique, we develop an
approach to FROG-PR for the analytic signals of even lengths, and prove that in
this case the generic analytic signals can be uniquely (up to the ambiguity)
determined by their $(3N/2+1)$ FROG measurements.

an underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system using an optical

optimum transmission rate in a UWOC system, time-domain hybrid pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM) (TDHP) using a transmission rate and distance-adaptive
intensity modulation/direct detection optical transceiver is considered. In the
TDHP method, variable transmission capacity is actualized while changing the
generation ratio of two intensity-modulated signals with different noise
immunities in the time domain. Three different color laser diodes (LDs), red,
blue, and green are used in an underwater channel transmission transceiver that
comprises the LD and a photodiode. The maximum transmission distance while
changing the incidence of PAM 2 and PAM 4 signals that calibrate the TDHP in a
pure transmission line and how the maximum transmission distance changes when
the optical transmitter/receiver spatial optical system is altered from the

To the best knowledge of the authors, there is no other research on data-rate

optimization between two modulation formats.

frequencies and wideband excitation of twisted pairs up to 12GHz. Although
there is a large quantity of papers on twisted pairs, the papers in the
literature mostly focus on the sub-1GHz spectrum, where the current digital
subscriber line technologies operate. Higher carrier frequencies on twisted
pairs can enable the data rates required by the future communication networks;
hence, the existing copper infrastructure can be utilised on the last mile
complementing the fibre networks. Towards this objective, we derive analytical
expression for the electromagnetic fields and characteristic equation of
twisted pairs. With these derivations we show a fundamental limit on the
operating frequency of twisted pairs beyond which twisted pairs start to
radiate and behave like an antenna. To validate our theory through
measurements, we designed a microstrip balun in order to excite the
differential mode on the twisted pairs. Unlike off-the-shelf devices, this
balun has a nearly linear transmission curve across 1-12GHz. This linearity
allows us to detect the radiation which would not have been possible with an
off-the-shelf device. At the end, we demonstrate that the standard twisted
pairs used in the UK can be used up to 5GHz carrier frequency without any
radiation effect and this upper-bound can be moved to higher frequencies by
decreasing the twist lengths.

structures with residual stresses. We advocate and develop a special approach
to residual stresses based on the transition between reference configurations.
The finite strain kinematics of the viscoplastic material is modelled by the
multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor. Numerical
algorithms originally developed for unstressed materials are extended to
materials with pre-stresses. Owing to the weak invariance of constitutive
equations, the incorporation of pre-stresses happens without additional costs.
Thus, the advocated approach is especially efficient. A novel
experimental/theoretical method for assessment of residual stresses in welded
structures is presented; the method combines advantages of purely experimental
and theoretical approaches. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
procedure, we simulate plate welding. As an example we show that the procedure
allows to extrapolate the filed of residual stresses away from the measurement
points. As another example, we address the reduction of weldment-related
residual stresses by mechanical treatment.
