that charged black holes tend towards extremality. In view of some evidence
pointing towards extremal black holes being effectively singular, this would
violate the cosmic censorship conjecture. Nevertheless, since the Kim-Wen model
is too simplistic (e.g. it assumes a continuous spectrum of particles with

could avoid this problem. In this work, we show that having only a finite

magnetic resonance imaging. In order to achieve better image quality and avoid
manual parameter tuning, we propose a probabilistic Bayesian approach to
recover $R_2^*$ map and phase images for quantitative susceptibility mapping
(QSM), while allowing automatic parameter estimation from undersampled data.
  Theory: Sparse prior on the wavelet coefficients of images is interpreted
from a Bayesian perspective as sparsity-promoting distribution. A novel
nonlinear approximate message passing (AMP) framework that incorporates a
mono-exponential decay model is proposed. The parameters are treated as unknown
variables and jointly estimated with image wavelet coefficients.
  Results: The proposed AMP with parameter estimation (AMP-PE) approach
successfully recovers $R_2^*$ maps and phase images for QSM across various
undersampling rates. It is more computationally efficient, and performs better
than the state-of-the-art $l_1$-norm regularization (L1) approach in general,
except a few cases where the L1 approach performs as well as AMP-PE.
  Conclusion: AMP-PE achieves better performance by drawing information from
both the sparse prior and the mono-exponential decay model. It does not require
parameter tuning, and works with a clinical, prospective undersampling scheme
where parameter tuning is often impossible or difficult due to the lack of
ground-truth image.

Short development cycles are easy to achieve if you start a software project on
a green field. Nevertheless, this does not apply to brown field environments
which are usually found in big corporates such as traditional car

to interface legacy systems with development cycles of up to several months. We

fully ordered whereas their magnetic properties strongly depend on the

generates a magnetic spiral stabilized through directionally assisted long
range coupling between canted locally frustrated spins. Moreover the
orientation of its magnetic spiral can be critical for the magnetoelectric
response of this chiral magnetic oxide. We have synthesized and studied
YBaCuFe1-xMnxO5 samples doped with Mn, with the aim of increasing spin-orbit

magnetometry, X-ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements. The tilting
angles of the spins in the collinear, {\theta}col , and spiral phases,

{\theta}col is also independent of the Mn content. In contrast, the presence of

shown that the waveform selection problem can be effectively addressed using a

curvature-induced chiral symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation, at
finite temperature. Using a scale-dependent analysis, we derive a thermal bound
on the curvature of local patches of spacetime. This bound quantifies regions
in parameter space that remain unaffected by gravitational catalysis and thus
are compatible with the existence of light fermions as observed in Nature.
While finite temperature generically relaxes the curvature bound, we observe a
comparatively strong dependence of the phenomenon on the details of the
curvature.
  Our bound can be applied to scenarios of quantum gravity, as any realistic
candidate has to accommodate a sufficient number of light fermions. We argue
that our bound therefore represents a test for quantum gravity scenarios: a
suitably averaged spacetime in the (trans-)Planckian regime that satisfies our
curvature bound does not induce correspondingly large Planckian fermion masses
by gravitational catalysis. The temperature dependence derived in this work
facilitates to follow the fate of gravitational catalysis during the thermal
history of the (quantum) universe. In an application to the Asymptotic Safety
scenario of quantum gravity, our bound translates into a temperature-dependent
upper bound on the number of fermion flavors.

contrastive learning methods have reached remarkable success in obtaining
meaningful feature representations from multi-view data. However, these methods

land-cover class by the joint use of pre-trained features and spectral
information of the image itself. Experimental results show that the proposed
approach achieves a comparable accuracy and that reduces the dimension of
features with respect to the image-level contrastive learning method. Among
three fusion fashions, the intermediate fusion strategy achieves the best
performance. The combination of the pixel-level fusion approach and spectral
indices leads to further improvements on the land-cover mapping task with
respect to the image-level fusion approach, especially with few pseudo labels.

is envisioned to enhance signal coverage in cases where obstacles block the
direct communication from Base Stations (BSs), and when high carrier
frequencies are used that are sensitive to attenuation losses. In the
literature, the exploitation of RISs is exclusively based on traditional
coherent demodulation, which necessitates the availability of Channel State

computes the pre/post spatial coders and the RIS configuration. The latter
tasks require significant amount of time and resources, which may not be
affordable when the channel is time-varying or the CSI is not accurate enough.

multi-antenna BS and present a novel RIS-empowered Orthogonal Frequency

phase shift keying, which is suitable for high noise and/or mobility scenarios.

Realizing these topological qubits is experimentally challenging, requiring

towards anomalies in the first row of the CKM matrix. Namely, determination of

violation of first row unitarity at about $4\sigma$ level. Moreover, there is
tension between determinations of $V_{us}$ obtained from leptonic $K\mu2$ and
semileptonic $K\ell3$ kaon decays. These discrepancies can be explained if
there exist extra vector-like quarks at the TeV scale, which have large enough
mixings with the lighter quarks. In particular, extra vector-like weak singlets
quarks can be thought as a solution to the CKM unitarity problem and an extra
vector-like weak doublet can in principle resolve all tensions. The
implications of this kind of mixings are examined against the flavour changing
phenomena and SM precision tests. We consider separately the effects of an
extra down-type isosinglet, up-type isosinglet and an isodoublet containing
extra quarks of both up and down type, and determine available parameter spaces
for each case. We find that the experimental constraints on flavor changing
phenomena become more stringent with larger masses, so that the extra species
should have masses no more than few TeV. Moreover, only one type of extra
multiplet cannot entirely explain all the discrepancies, and some their
combination is required. We show that these scenarios are testable with future
experiments. Namely, if extra vector-like quarks are responsible for CKM
anomalies, then at least one of them should be found at scale of few TeV, and
anomalous weak isospin violating $Z$-boson couplings with light quarks should
be detected if the experimental precision on $Z$ hadronic decay rate is

mechanism has been discovered, we currently have no acceptable dynamical model
of the Walrasian system"" (Gintis 2006). In his paper, Gintis put forward a
model for price discovery based on the evolution of the model's agents, i.e.
""poorly performing agents dying and being replaced by copies of the well
performing agents."" It seems improbable that this mechanism is the driving
force behind price discovery in the real world. This paper proposes a more
realistic mechanism and presents results from a corresponding agent based
model.

interconnection and how biological communities respond to environmental
changes. However, ecological studies of species' interactions are limited by
their geographic and taxonomic focus which can distort our understanding of
interaction dynamics. We focus on bird-plant interactions that refer to
situations of potential fruit consumption and seed dispersal. We develop an
approach for predicting species' interactions that accounts for errors in the
recorded interaction networks, addresses the geographic and taxonomic biases of
existing studies, is based on latent factors to increase flexibility and borrow
information across species, incorporates covariates in a flexible manner to
inform the latent factors, and uses a meta-analysis data set from 85 individual
studies. We focus on interactions among 232 birds and 511 plants in the
Atlantic Forest, and identify 5% of pairs of species with an unrecorded
interaction, but posterior probability that the interaction is possible over
80%. Finally, we develop a permutation-based variable importance procedure for
latent factor network models and identify that a bird's body mass and a plant's
fruit diameter are important in driving the presence of species interactions,
with a multiplicative relationship that exhibits both a thresholding and a
matching behavior.

we propose a 3D point-based scene graph generation ($\mathbf{SGG_{point}}$)
framework to effectively bridge perception and reasoning to achieve scene
understanding via three sequential stages, namely scene graph construction,
reasoning, and inference. Within the reasoning stage, an EDGE-oriented Graph
Convolutional Network ($\texttt{EdgeGCN}$) is created to exploit
multi-dimensional edge features for explicit relationship modeling, together
with the exploration of two associated twinning interaction mechanisms between
nodes and edges for the independent evolution of scene graph representations.
Overall, our integrated $\mathbf{SGG_{point}}$ framework is established to seek
and infer scene structures of interest from both real-world and synthetic 3D
point-based scenes. Our experimental results show promising edge-oriented
reasoning effects on scene graph generation studies. We also demonstrate our
method advantage on several traditional graph representation learning benchmark
datasets, including the node-wise classification on citation networks and
whole-graph recognition problems for molecular analysis.

property that every three members of it are intersected by a line, then there

question of Eckhoff from 1993, who proved that, under the same condition, there
are four lines intersecting all the sets. In fact, we prove a colorful version
of this result, under weakened conditions on the sets.
  A triple of sets $A,B,C$ in the plane is said to be a {\em tight} if
$\textrm{conv}(A\cup B)\cap \textrm{conv}(A\cup C)\cap \textrm{conv}(B\cap

that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of compact convex sets in the plane in which
every three sets form a tight triple, then there is a line intersecting at
least $\frac{1}{8}|\mathcal{F}|$ members of $\mathcal{F}$. Here we prove that
if $\mathcal{F}_1,\dots,\mathcal{F}_6$ are families of compact connected sets
in the plane such that every three sets, chosen from three distinct families
$\mathcal{F}_i$, form a tight triple, then there exists $1\le j\le 6$ and three

singular. In this paper we introducing second order accurate DVI schemes, both
with and without non-uniform time stepping. We show that it is not in general
possible to construct a second order scheme with a preserved two-form by
composing a first order scheme with its adjoint, and discuss the conditions
under which such a composition is possible. We build two classes of second
order accurate DVI schemes. We test these second order schemes numerically on
two systems having noncanonical variables, namely the magnetic field line and
guiding center systems. Variational integration for Hamiltonian systems with
nonuniform time steps, in terms of an extended phase space Hamiltonian, is
generalized to noncanonical variables. It is shown that preservation of proper
degeneracy leads to single-step methods without parasitic modes, i.e. to
non-uniform time step DVIs. This extension applies to second order accurate as
well as first order schemes, and can be applied to adapt the time stepping to
an error estimate.

uncommon deformation behaviors such as transformation-induced plasticity, which
were largely believed to be restricted to select families of steels. Coupled
with the potential for entropy stabilization of high symmetry phases at high
temperatures, this system represents a promising class of materials for
structural applications in extreme environments. Yet, transformation-induced
plasticity mechanisms are notably sensitive to microstructure parameters and
the literature offers examples of deleterious decomposition of high entropy
alloys under heat treatment, which raises concerns of resiliency in mechanical
performance. Here, we evaluate the evolution of microstructure and mechanical
properties of a FeMnCoCr high entropy alloy after prolonged heat treatment at
high temperature. Microstructures are found to retain their characteristic
austenite/martensite features, with parent face-centered cubic grains
partitioned by hexagonal close-packed laths after heat treatment at 1200 C for
up to 48 hours. Results of mechanical testing reveal an unusual insensitivity
of this alloy to grain growth-induced weakening effects. Namely, the yield
strengths of FeMnCoCr samples are observed to remain constant across all heat
treatment conditions, despite a near four-fold increase in the grain size.
Close examination of post-heat treatment microstructures reveals a dramatic
decrease in the inter-lath spacing at longer durations, which segments parent
austenite grains. This crystal partitioning counteracts conventional grain
growth-induced weakening by introducing additional barriers for dislocation
pile-up. These results offer new insights into the mechanical resiliency of
this transformation-induced plasticity high entropy alloy under prolonged high

large fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal
information. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on
speculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone.
To add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective
because of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test
folds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit
these weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque
and their 'reasoning' process is uninterpretable. An equally important
limitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only
of the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the
correct(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a
key structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and
build a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner
identifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity
which can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage
mentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQAS3, a subset of OKVQA
annotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from

generally known that deep learning is a data-driven method. Data directly
impact the performance of object detectors to some extent. Although existing
datasets have included common objects in remote sensing images, they still have
some limitations in terms of scale, categories, and images. Therefore, there is
a strong requirement for establishing a large-scale benchmark on object

novel benchmark dataset with more than 1 million instances and more than 15,000
images for Fine-grAined object recognItion in high-Resolution remote sensing
imagery which is named as FAIR1M. All objects in the FAIR1M dataset are
annotated with respect to 5 categories and 37 sub-categories by oriented
bounding boxes. Compared with existing detection datasets dedicated to object
detection, the FAIR1M dataset has 4 particular characteristics: (1) it is much
larger than other existing object detection datasets both in terms of the
quantity of instances and the quantity of images, (2) it provides more rich
fine-grained category information for objects in remote sensing images, (3) it
contains geographic information such as latitude, longitude and resolution, (4)
it provides better image quality owing to a careful data cleaning procedure. To
establish a baseline for fine-grained object recognition, we propose a novel
evaluation method and benchmark fine-grained object detection tasks and a
visual classification task using several State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deep
learning-based models on our FAIR1M dataset. Experimental results strongly
indicate that the FAIR1M dataset is closer to practical application and it is
considerably more challenging than existing datasets.

reasoning about highly-concurrent database programs. Unfortunately, enforcing
serializability has a high-performance cost, especially on geographically
distributed database clusters. Consequently, many databases allow programmers
to choose when a transaction must be executed under serializability, with the
expectation that transactions would only be so marked when necessary to avoid
serious concurrency bugs. However, this is a significant burden to impose on
developers, requiring them to (a) reason about subtle concurrent interactions
among potentially interfering transactions, (b) determine when such
interactions would violate desired invariants, and (c) then identify the
minimum number of transactions whose executions should be serialized to prevent
these violations. To mitigate this burden, in this paper we present a sound and
fully automated schema refactoring procedure that transforms a program's data
layout -- rather than its concurrency control logic -- to eliminate statically
identified concurrency bugs, allowing more transactions to be safely executed
under weaker and more performant database guarantees. Experimental results over
a range of database benchmarks indicate that our approach is highly effective

stability of the proposed control algorithm is established using the Lyapunov
method and homogeneous approximation theory, which guarantees an accelerated
convergence within a settling time that does not dependent on initial
conditions. Based on this, to significantly reduce the communication burdens,
an event-triggered communication mechanism is designed which can also avoid
Zeno behavior. Then sufficient conditions on the event-triggered boundary are
derived to guarantee the stability and reliability of the whole system.
Practical local constraints are imposed to implement the control protocol, and
the theoretical results are applied to a test system consisting of five DGs and

  spectra","18 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.105.023517",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Upcoming measurements of the small-scale primary cosmic microwave background
(CMB) temperature and polarization power spectra ($TT$/$TE$/$EE$) are
anticipated to yield transformative constraints on new physics, including the
effective number of relativistic species in the early universe ($N_{\rm eff}$).
However, at multipoles $\ell \gtrsim 3000$, the primary CMB power spectra
receive significant contributions from gravitational lensing. While these modes
still carry primordial information, their theoretical modeling requires
knowledge of the CMB lensing convergence power spectrum, $C_L^{\kappa\kappa}$,
including on small scales where it is affected by nonlinear gravitational
evolution and baryonic feedback processes. Thus, the high-$\ell$ primary CMB is
sensitive to these late-time, nonlinear effects. Here, we show that
inaccuracies in the modeling of $C_L^{\kappa\kappa}$ can yield surprisingly
large biases on cosmological parameters inferred from the primary CMB power
spectra measured by the upcoming Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 experiments. For
CMB-S4, the biases can be as large as $1.6\sigma$ on the Hubble constant $H_0$
in a fit to $\Lambda$CDM and $1.2\sigma$ on $N_{\rm eff}$ in a fit to
$\Lambda$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$.
  We show that these biases can be mitigated by explicitly discarding all $TT$
data at $\ell>3000$ or by marginalizing over parameters describing baryonic
feedback processes, both at the cost of slightly larger error bars. We also
discuss an alternative, data-driven mitigation strategy based on delensing the
CMB $T$ and $E$-mode maps. Finally, we show that analyses of upcoming data will
require Einstein-Boltzmann codes to be run with much higher numerical precision
settings than is currently standard, so as to avoid similar -- or larger --
parameter biases due to inaccurate theoretical predictions.

The broader accessibility of earlier approaches is hindered by the need of

SimSiam approach addresses such key limitations via stop-gradient without

achieved from the same patient or tissue. Inspired by these advances, we
propose a simple triplet representation learning (SimTriplet) approach on
pathological images. The contribution of the paper is three-fold: (1) The
proposed SimTriplet method takes advantage of the multi-view nature of medical
images beyond self-augmentation; (2) The method maximizes both intra-sample and
inter-sample similarities via triplets from positive pairs, without using
negative samples; and (3) The recent mix precision training is employed to
advance the training by only using a single GPU with 16GB memory. By learning
from 79,000 unlabeled pathological patch images, SimTriplet achieved 10.58%
better performance compared with supervised learning. It also achieved 2.13%
better performance compared with SimSiam. Our proposed SimTriplet can achieve
decent performance using only 1% labeled data. The code and data are available

counting the induced copies of a $k$-vertex graph $H$ in a $d$-degenerate

complexity classifications for counting subgraphs and induced subgraphs. We
show that the (not necessarily induced) copies of $H$ in $G$ can be counted in
time $f(k,d)\cdot n^{\max(\mathsf{imn}(H),1)}\cdot \log n$, where $f$ is some
computable function and $\mathsf{imn}(H)$ is the size of the largest induced

matching number, this algorithm is essentially optimal: Unless the Exponential
Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails, there is no algorithm running in time $f(k,d)\cdot
n^{o(\mathsf{imn}(H)/\log \mathsf{imn}(H))}$ for any function $f$. In case of
counting induced subgraphs, we obtain a similar classification along the
independence number $\alpha$: we can count the induced copies of $H$ in $G$ in
time $f(k,d)\cdot n^{\alpha(H)}\cdot \log n$, and if the class of allowed
patterns has unbounded independence number, an algorithm running in time
$f(k,d)\cdot n^{o(\alpha(H)/\log \alpha(H))}$ is impossible, unless ETH fails.
In the language of parameterized complexity, our results yield dichotomies in
fixed-parameter tractable and $\#\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard cases if we parameterize
by the size of the pattern and the degeneracy of the host graph. Our results
imply that several patterns cannot be counted in time $f(k,d)\cdot n^{o(k/\log

(induced) $k$-cycles, and induced $(k,k)$-bicliques, unless ETH fails. Those
lower bounds for exact counting are complemented with new algorithms for

Artificial Intelligence (AI) services. Recently, these Machine Learning (ML)
methods, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), presented exceptional achievement
in implementing human-level capabilities for various predicaments, such as
Natural Processing Language (NLP), voice recognition, and image processing,
etc. Training these models are expensive in terms of computational power and
the existence of enough labelled data. Thus, ML-based models such as DNNs
establish genuine business value and intellectual property (IP) for their
owners. Therefore the trained models need to be protected from any adversary
attacks such as illegal redistribution, reproducing, and derivation.
Watermarking can be considered as an effective technique for securing a DNN
model. However, so far, most of the watermarking algorithm focuses on
watermarking the DNN by adding noise to an image. To this end, we propose a
framework for watermarking a DNN model designed for a textual domain. The
watermark generation scheme provides a secure watermarking method by combining
Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of a particular word.
The proposed embedding procedure takes place in the model's training time,
making the watermark verification stage straightforward by sending the
watermarked document to the trained model. The experimental results show that
watermarked models have the same accuracy as the original ones. The proposed
framework accurately verifies the ownership of all surrogate models without
impairing the performance. The proposed algorithm is robust against well-known
attacks such as parameter pruning and brute force attack.

$C\left(f\right)^{2-o\left(1\right)}$. Due to recent results by Ben-David,

in query and communication complexity. For example, it gives a function $f$
with $C(f)=\Omega(deg^{2-o\left(1\right)}(f))$ where $C$ and $deg$ denote
certificate complexity and polynomial degree of $f$. (This is the first
improvement over a separation between $C(f)$ and $deg(f)$ by Kushilevitz and

between sensitivity and polynomial degree, a near-optimal lower bound on
conondeterministic communication complexity for Clique vs. Independent Set
problem and a near-optimal lower bound on complexity of Alon--Saks--Seymour

find the effective index of the structure and its other propagation parameters.
Two special exemplary structures have been introduced and studied to show the

treatment planning system (TPS, Varian Eclipse) are presented for a modified
ultra-high dose-rate electron FLASH radiotherapy (eFLASH-RT) LINAC.
  Methods: The gantry head without scattering foils or targets, representative
of the LINAC modifications, was modelled in Geant4. The energy spectrum
({\sigma}E) and beam source emittance cone angle ({\theta}cone) were varied to
match the calculated and Gafchromic film measured central-axis percent depth
dose (PDD) and lateral profiles. Its Eclipse configuration was validated with
measured profiles of the open field and nominal fields for clinical
applicators. eFLASH-RT plans were MC forward calculated in Geant4 for a mouse
brain treatment and compared to a conventional (Conv-RT) plan in Eclipse for a
human patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
  Results: The beam model and its Eclipse configuration agreed best with
measurements at {\sigma}E=0.5 MeV and {\theta}cone=3.9+/-0.2 degrees to
clinically acceptable accuracy (the absolute average error was within 1.5% for
in-water lateral, 3% for in-air lateral, and 2% for PDD). The forward dose
calculation showed dose was delivered to the entire mouse brain with adequate
conformality. The human patient case demonstrated the planning capability with
routine accessories in relatively complex geometry to achieve an acceptable
plan (90% of the tumor volume receiving 95% and 90% of the prescribed dose for
eFLASH and Conv-RT, respectively).
  Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first functional beam
model commissioned in a clinical TPS for eFLASH-RT, enabling planning and
evaluation with minimal deviation from Conv-RT workflow. It facilitates the
clinical translation as eFLASH-RT and Conv-RT plan quality were comparable for
a human patient. The methods can be expanded to model other eFLASH irradiators.

  Representation","Accepted","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 2021",,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the rapid advancements of sensory and computing technology,
multi-modal data sources that represent the same pattern or phenomenon have
attracted growing attention. As a result, finding means to explore useful
information from these multi-modal data sources has quickly become a necessity.
In this paper, a discriminative vectorial framework is proposed for multi-modal
feature representation in knowledge discovery by employing multi-modal hashing
(MH) and discriminative correlation maximization (DCM) analysis. Specifically,
the proposed framework is capable of minimizing the semantic similarity among
different modalities by MH and exacting intrinsic discriminative
representations across multiple data sources by DCM analysis jointly, enabling
a novel vectorial framework of multi-modal feature representation. Moreover,
the proposed feature representation strategy is analyzed and further optimized
based on canonical and non-canonical cases, respectively. Consequently, the
generated feature representation leads to effective utilization of the input
data sources of high quality, producing improved, sometimes quite impressive,
results in various applications. The effectiveness and generality of the
proposed framework are demonstrated by utilizing classical features and deep
neural network (DNN) based features with applications to image and multimedia
analysis and recognition tasks, including data visualization, face recognition,
object recognition; cross-modal (text-image) recognition and audio emotion
recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed solutions are superior
to state-of-the-art statistical machine learning (SML) and DNN algorithms.

the discrete general relativity, the Regge calculus, is quantized within the

existence of a length scale at which edge lengths are loosely fixed, as
considered in our earlier paper.
  In addition, we previously considered the Regge action on a simplicial
manifold on which the vertices are coordinatized and the corresponding
piecewise constant metric introduced, and found that for the simplest periodic
simplicial structure and in the leading order over metric variations between
4-simplices, this reduces to a finite-difference form of the Hilbert-Einstein

  The problem of solving the corresponding discrete Einstein equations
(classical) with a length scale (having a quantum nature) arises as the problem
of determining the optimal background metric for the perturbative expansion
generated by the functional integral. Using an one-complex-function ansatz for
the metric, which reduces to the Kerr-Schild metric in the continuum, we find a
discrete metric that approximates the continuum one at large distances and is
nonsingular on the (earlier) singularity ring. The effective curvature

a model in which Gault is rotating near breakup, with centrifugal forces
responsible for its episodic mass loss. Approximated as a strengthless (fluid)

whose lower edge coincides with $\lambda_{IR}=0$, the singularity of spectral
density defining the IR phase, and the upper edge with $\lambda_A$, the

  Main Results
  (1) We present a numerically stable algorithm for constructing a matrix of
DLOPs L in O(qN)
  (2) The Legendre Delay Network (LDN) can be used to form a discrete function
basis with a basis transformation matrix H in O(qN).
  (3) If q < 300, convolving with the LDN basis online has a lower run-time
complexity than convolving with arbitrary FIR filters.
  (4) Sliding window transformations exist for some bases (Haar, cosine,
Fourier) and require O(q) operations per sample and O(N) memory.
  (5) LTI systems similar to the LDN can be constructed for many discrete
function bases; the LDN system is superior in terms of having a finite impulse
response.
  (6) We compare discrete function bases by linearly decoding delays from
signals represented with respect to these bases. Results are depicted in Figure
20. Overall, decoding errors are similar. The LDN basis has the highest and the
Fourier and cosine bases have the smallest errors.
  (7) The Fourier and cosine bases feature a uniform decoding error for all
delays. These bases should be used if the signal can be represented well in the
Fourier domain.
  (8) Neural network experiments suggest that fixed temporal convolutions can
outperform learned convolutions. The basis choice is not critical; we roughly
observe the same performance trends as in the delay task.
  (9) The LDN is the right choice for small q, if the O(q) Euler update is

we fully characterize optimal performance and near-optimal pricing algorithms

allows to characterize optimal performance for deterministic or more general
randomized mechanisms, and leads to fundamental novel insights on the value of

coronal height. This result, along with the finding that the corona contracts
in the hard state, suggests a close relationship between spatial extent of the
X-ray corona and the radio jet. We find the corona expansion (as probed by
reverberation) precedes a radio flare by ~5 days, which may suggest that the

launching a jet knot that propagates along the jet stream at relativistic

of the largest clique and independent set in a graph on $N$ vertices. By the
celebrated result of Erd\H{o}s from 1947, the random graph on $N$ vertices with
edge probability $1/2$, contains no clique or independent set larger than
$2\log_2 N$, with high probability. Finding explicit constructions of graphs
with similar Ramsey-type properties is a famous open problem. A natural
approach is to construct such graphs using algebraic tools. Say that an
$r$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is \emph{algebraic of complexity
$(n,d,m)$} if the vertices of $\mathcal{H}$ are elements of $\mathbb{F}^{n}$
for some field $\mathbb{F}$, and there exist $m$ polynomials
$f_1,\dots,f_m:(\mathbb{F}^{n})^{r}\rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ of degree at most
$d$ such that the edges of $\mathcal{H}$ are determined by the zero-patterns of
$f_1,\dots,f_m$. The aim of this paper is to show that if an algebraic graph
(or hypergraph) of complexity $(n,d,m)$ has good Ramsey properties, then at
least one of the parameters $n,d,m$ must be large. In 2001, R\'onyai, Babai and
Ganapathy considered the bipartite variant of the Ramsey problem and proved
that if $G$ is an algebraic graph of complexity $(n,d,m)$ on $N$ vertices, then
either $G$ or its complement contains a complete balanced bipartite graph of
size $\Omega_{n,d,m}(N^{1/(n+1)})$. We extend this result by showing that such
$G$ contains either a clique or an independent set of size $N^{\Omega(1/ndm)}$
and prove similar results for algebraic hypergraphs of constant complexity. We
also obtain a polynomial regularity lemma for $r$-uniform algebraic hypergraphs
that are defined by a single polynomial, that might be of independent interest.
Our proofs combine algebraic, geometric and combinatorial tools.

that transfer learning can beat the minimum mean square error (MMSE) solution

$k$, denoted by TP_k (or TN_k), if all minors of size at most $k$ are positive
(or non-negative). These matrices have featured in diverse areas in
mathematics, including algebra, analysis, combinatorics, and probability
theory. The goal of this article is to provide a novel connection between total
positivity and optimization/game theory. Specifically, we draw a relationship
between TP matrices and the Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP), which
generalizes and unifies linear and quadratic programming problems and bimatrix
games - this connection is unexplored, to the best of our knowledge. We show
that $A$ is $TP_k$ if and only if for every contiguous square submatrix $A_r$
of $A$, $LCP(A_r,q)$ has a unique solution for each vector $q<0$. In fact this
can be strengthened to check the solution set of LCP at a single vector for
each such square submatrix. These novel characterizations are in the spirit of
classical results characterizing $TP$ matrices by Gantmacher-Krein [Compos.
Math. 1937] and P-matrices by Ingleton [Proc. London Math. Soc. 1966].
  Our work contains two other contributions, both of which characterize TP
using single test vectors. First, we improve on one of the main results in

improve on a classical characterization of TP by Brown-Johnstone-MacGibbon [J.
Amer. Statist. Assoc. 1981] (following Gantmacher-Krein, 1950) involving the
variation diminishing property. Finally, we use a P\'olya frequency function of
Karlin [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 1964] to show that our aforementioned
characterizations of TP, involving test-vectors drawn from the `alternating'
bi-orthant, do not work if these vectors are drawn from any other open orthant.

connected more than forty years ago. Despite the nonequilibrium nature of the
laser, the Landau theory of thermal phase transitions, applied directly to the
Scully-Lamb laser model (SLLM), indicates that the laser threshold is a
second-order phase transition, associated with a $U(1)$ spontaneous symmetry
breaking (SSB). To capture the genuine nonequilibrium phase transition of the
SLLM (i.e., a single-mode laser without a saturable absorber), here we employ a
quantum theory of dissipative phase transitions. Our results confirm that the
$U(1)$ SSB can occur at the lasing threshold but, in contrast to the Landau
theory and semiclassical approximation, they signal that the SLLM ""fundamental""
transition is a different phenomenon, which we call Liouvillian spectral
collapse; that is, the emergence of diabolic points of infinite degeneracy. By
considering a generalized SLLM with additional dephasing, we witness a
second-order phase transition, with a Liouvillian spectral collapse, but in the
absence of symmetry breaking. Most surprisingly, the phase transition
corresponds to the emergence of dynamical multistability even without SSB.
Normally, bistability is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, while in this
case, the very presence of quantum fluctuations enables bistability. This
rather anomalous bistability, characterizing the truly dissipative and quantum
origin of lasing, can be an experimental signature of our predictions, and we
show that it is associated with an emergent dynamical hysteresis.

analyzed data from this Delft experiment [Zhang et al., arXiv:2101.11456
(2021)], we discuss the general problem of confirmation bias in experiments
verifying various theoretical topological quantization predictions. We show
that the Delft Majorana experiment is most likely dominated by disorder, which
produces trivial (but quite sharp and large) zero-bias Andreev tunneling peaks
with large conductance $ \sim 2e^2/h $ in the theory, closely mimicking the
data. It is possible to misinterpret such disorder-induced zero-bias trivial
peaks as the apparent Majorana quantization, as was originally done in 2018
arising from confirmation bias. One characteristic of the disorder-induced
trivial peaks is that they manifest little stability as a function of Zeeman
field and tunnel barrier, distinguishing their trivial behavior from the
expected topological robustness of non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. We also
analyze a more recent nanowire experiment [Yu et al., Nature Physics (2021)]
which is known to have a huge amount of disorder, showing that such highly
disordered nanowires may produce very small above-background trivial peaks with
values $ \sim 2e^2/h $.

quantum noise can be exploited to sample degenerate ground and low-energy spin
configurations of the Ising model. We formulate a general discrete-time
Gaussian-state model of the MFB-CIM which faithfully captures the nonlinear
dynamics present at and above system threshold. This model overcomes the
limitations of both mean-field models, which neglect quantum noise, and
continuous-time models, which assume long photon lifetimes. Numerical
simulations of our model show that when the MFB-CIM is operated in a
quantum-noise-dominated regime with short photon lifetimes (i.e., low cavity
finesse), homodyne monitoring of the system can efficiently produce samples of
low-energy Ising spin configurations, requiring many fewer roundtrips to sample
than suggested by established high-finesse, continuous-time models. We find
that sampling performance is robust to, or even improved by, turning off or
altogether reversing the sign of the parametric drive, but performance is
critically reduced in the absence of optical nonlinearity. For the class of
MAX-CUT problems with binary-signed edge weights, the number of roundtrips
sufficient to fully sample all spin configurations up to the first-excited
Ising energy, including all degeneracies, scales as $1.08^N$. At a problem size
of $N = 100$ with a few dozen (median of 20) such desired configurations per

roundtrips; in an experimental implementation of an MFB-CIM with a 10 GHz
repetition rate, this corresponds to a wall-clock sampling time of 60 ms.

entries of $A$ that need to be changed in order to obtain a matrix of rank at
most $r$. At MFCS'77, Valiant introduced matrix rigidity as a tool to prove
circuit lower bounds for linear functions and since then this notion received
much attention and found applications in other areas of complexity theory. The
problem of constructing an explicit family of matrices that are sufficiently
rigid for Valiant's reduction (Valiant-rigid) still remains open. Moreover,
since 2017 most of the long-studied candidates have been shown not to be
Valiant-rigid. Some of those former candidates for rigidity are Kronecker
products of small matrices.
  In a recent paper (STOC'21), Alman gave a general non-rigidity result for
such matrices: he showed that if an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ (over any field) is
a Kronecker product of $d\times d$ matrices $M_1,\dots, M_k$ (so $n=d^k$)
$(d\ge 2)$ then changing only $n^{1+\varepsilon}$ entries of $A$ one can reduce
its rank to $\le n^{1-\gamma}$, where $1/\gamma$ is roughly
$2^d/\varepsilon^2$.
  In this note we improve this result in two directions. First, we do not
require the matrices $M_i$ to have equal size. Second, we reduce $1/\gamma$
from exponential in $d$ to roughly $d^{3/2}/\varepsilon^2$ (where $d$ is the
maximum size of the matrices $M_i$), and to nearly linear (roughly
$d/\varepsilon^2$) for matrices $M_i$ of sizes within a constant factor of each
other.
  As an application of our results we significantly expand the class of
Hadamard matrices that are known not to be Valiant-rigid; these now include the
Kronecker products of Paley-Hadamard matrices and Hadamard matrices of bounded
size.

Hamiltonian systems, whose solution flows give such symplectic maps. For this
special case, both generic approaches based on learning the vector field of the
latent ODE and specialized approaches based on learning the Hamiltonian that
generates the vector field exist. Our method, however, is different as it does
not rely on the vector field nor assume its existence; instead, it directly
learns the symplectic evolution map in discrete time. Moreover, we do so by
representing the symplectic map via a generating function, which we approximate
by a neural network (hence the name GFNN). This way, our approximation of the
evolution map is always \emph{exactly} symplectic. This additional geometric
structure allows the local prediction error at each step to accumulate in a
controlled fashion, and we will prove, under reasonable assumptions, that the
global prediction error grows at most \emph{linearly} with long prediction
time, which significantly improves an otherwise exponential growth. In
addition, as a map-based and thus purely data-driven method, GFNN avoids two
additional sources of inaccuracies common in vector-field based approaches,
namely the error in approximating the vector field by finite difference of the
data, and the error in numerical integration of the vector field for making
predictions. Numerical experiments further demonstrate our claims.

optimization. Once the model's final parameters are released, there is
currently no mechanism for the entity which trained the model to prove that
these parameters were indeed the result of this optimization procedure. Such a
mechanism would support security of ML applications in several ways. For
instance, it would simplify ownership resolution when multiple parties contest
ownership of a specific model. It would also facilitate the distributed
training across untrusted workers where Byzantine workers might otherwise mount
a denial-of-service by returning incorrect model updates.
  In this paper, we remediate this problem by introducing the concept of
proof-of-learning in ML. Inspired by research on both proof-of-work and
verified computations, we observe how a seminal training algorithm, stochastic
gradient descent, accumulates secret information due to its stochasticity. This
produces a natural construction for a proof-of-learning which demonstrates that
a party has expended the compute require to obtain a set of model parameters
correctly. In particular, our analyses and experiments show that an adversary
seeking to illegitimately manufacture a proof-of-learning needs to perform *at
least* as much work than is needed for gradient descent itself.
  We also instantiate a concrete proof-of-learning mechanism in both of the
scenarios described above. In model ownership resolution, it protects the
intellectual property of models released publicly. In distributed training, it
preserves availability of the training procedure. Our empirical evaluation
validates that our proof-of-learning mechanism is robust to variance induced by
the hardware (ML accelerators) and software stacks.

high-quality simplex meshes directly from scanned images in OBJ format in 2D

useful for a variety of applications including surgical simulators.
  The core idea of the FlowMesher is that a mesh domain is considered as an
""airtight container"" into which fluid particles are ""injected"" at one or
multiple selected interior points. The particles repel each other and occupy
the whole domain somewhat like blowing up a balloon. When the container is full
of fluid particles and the flow is stopped, a Delaunay triangulation algorithm
is employed to link the fluid particles together to generate an unstructured
mesh (which is then optimized using a combination of automated mesh smoothing
and element removal in 3D). The performance of the FlowMesher is demonstrated
by generating meshes for several 2D and 3D mesh domains including a scanned

electric charge is four or three times larger than that of protons. Such
particles, if they are light enough, may be produced at the LHC and detected.
We investigate the possibility of observing those long-lived multi-charged
particles with the MoEDAL detector, which is sensitive to long-lived particles
with low velocities ($\beta$) and a large electric charge ($Z$) with $\Theta
\equiv \beta/Z \lesssim 0.15$. We demonstrate that multi-charged scalar
particles with a large $Z$ give three-fold advantage for MoEDAL; reduction of
$\Theta$ due to strong interactions with the detector, and enhancement of the
photon-fusion process, which not only increases the production cross-section
but also lowers the average production velocity, reducing $\Theta$ further. To
demonstrate the performance of MoEDAL on multi-charged long-lived particles,
two concrete neutrino mass models are studied. In the first model, the new
physics sector is non-coloured and contains long-lived particles with electric
charges 2, 3 and 4. A model-independent study finds MoEDAL can expect more than
1 signal event at the HL-LHC ($L = 300$ fb$^{-1}$) if these particles are
lighter than 600, 1100 and 1430 GeV, respectively. These compare with the
current ATLAS limits 650, 780 and 920 GeV for $L = 36$ fb$^{-1}$. The second
model has a coloured new physics sector, which possesses long-lived particles
with electric charges 4/3, 7/3 and 10/3. The corresponding MoEDAL's mass
reaches at the HL-LHC are 1400, 1650 and 1800 GeV, respectively, which compare
with the current CMS limits 1450, 1480 and 1510 GeV for $L = 36$ fb$^{-1}$. In
a model-specific study we explore the parameter space of neutrino mass
generation models and identify the regions that can be probed with MoEDAL at

extending the particle content of the Standard Model (SM) with three right
handed neutrinos ($\nu_R$), a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate ($\psi$) and
a complex scalar ($\phi$), all of which are singlets under the SM gauge group.
An additional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry has been introduced for the stability of
dark matter candidate $\psi$ and also ensuring the Dirac nature of light
neutrinos at the same time. Both the right handed neutrinos and the dark matter
thermalise with the SM plasma due to a new Yukawa interaction involving
$\nu_R$, $\psi$ and $\phi$ while the latter maintains thermal contact via the
Higgs portal interaction. The decoupling of $\nu_R$ occurs when $\phi$ loses
its kinetic equilibrium with the SM plasma and thereafter all three
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ charged particles form an equilibrium among themselves with a
temperature $T_{\nu_R}$. The dark matter candidate $\psi$ finally freezes out
within the dark sector and preserves its relic abundance. We have found that in
the present scenario, some portion of low mass dark matter
($M_{\psi}\lesssim10$ GeV) is already excluded by the Planck 2018 data for
keeping $\nu_R$s in the thermal bath below a temperature of 600 MeV and thereby
producing an excess contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$. The next generation
experiments like CMB-S4, SPT-3G etc. will have the required sensitivities to
probe the entire model parameter space of this minimal scenario, especially the
low mass range of $\psi$ where direct detection experiments are still not
capable enough for detection.

suffer from up to a factor of 2 uncertainty. This is primarily due to the
oversimplifications of standard dynamical models that often neglect the effects
of the long-term evolution of GCs. Here, we introduce a new approach to measure
the dynamical properties of GCs, based on the combination of a deep-learning
framework and the large amount of data from direct $N$-body simulations. Our
algorithm, $\texttt{$\pi$-DOC}$ ($\textit{Predicting Images for the Dynamics Of
stellar Clusters}$) is composed of two convolutional networks, trained to learn
the non-trivial transformation between an observed GC luminosity map and its
associated mass distribution, age, and distance. The training set is made of
V-band luminosity and mass maps constructed as mock observations from $N$-body
simulations. The tests on $\texttt{$\pi$-DOC}$ demonstrate that we can predict
the mass distribution with a mean error per pixel of 27%, and the age and
distance with an accuracy of 1.5 Gyr and 6 kpc, respectively. In turn, we
recover the shape of the mass-to-light profile and its global value with a mean
error of 12%, which implies that we efficiently trace mass segregation. A
preliminary comparison with observations indicates that our algorithm is able
to predict the dynamical properties of GCs within the limits of the training
set. These encouraging results demonstrate that our deep-learning framework and
its forward modelling approach can offer a rapid and adaptable tool competitive
with standard dynamical models.

broken only by phase-biasing the proximitizing superconductors, which can be

this phase biasing and the phase arising from strong spin-orbit coupling in
closed electron trajectories. The principle is demonstrated analytically using
a simple model, and then shown numerically for realistic devices. We show a

galaxy clusters provides sensitive cosmological information. Aims. In this
work, we make use of a large photometric galaxy cluster sample, constructed
from the public Third Data Release of the Kilo-Degree Survey, and the
corresponding shear signal, to assess cluster masses and test the concordance
${\Lambda}$-cold dark matter (${\Lambda}$CDM) model. In particular, we study
the weak gravitational lensing effects on scales beyond the cluster virial
radius, where the signal is dominated by correlated and uncorrelated matter
density distributions along the line-of-sight. The analysed catalogue consists
of 6962 galaxy clusters, in the redshift range $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.6$ and with
signal-to-noise ratio larger than 3.5. Methods. We perform a full Bayesian
analysis to model the stacked shear profiles of these clusters. The adopted
likelihood function considers both the small-scale 1-halo term, used primarily
to constrain the cluster structural properties, and the 2-halo term, that can
be used to constrain cosmological parameters. Results. We find that the adopted
modelling is successful to assess both the cluster masses and the total matter
density parameter, ${\Omega}_M$, when fitting shear profiles up to the largest
available scales of 35 Mpc/h. Moreover, our results provide a strong
observational evidence of the 2-halo signal in the stacked gravitational
lensing of galaxy clusters, further demonstrating the reliability of this probe
for cosmological studies. The main result of this work is a robust constraint
on ${\Omega}_M$, assuming a flat ${\Lambda}$CDM cosmology. We get ${\Omega}_M =
0.29 \pm 0.02$, estimated from the full posterior probability distribution,
consistent with the estimates from cosmic microwave background experiments.

the reservoir available for planet formation - decreases over time as material
is accreted onto the central star. Observations show a correlation between dust
mass and the stellar accretion rate, as expected from viscous theory. However,
the gas mass inferred from 13CO and C18O line fluxes, which should be a more
direct measure, shows no such correlation. Using thermochemical DALI models, we
investigate how 13CO and C18O J=3-2 line fluxes change over time in a viscously
evolving disk. We also investigate if the chemical conversion of CO through
grain-surface chemistry combined with viscous evolution can explain the
observations of disks in Lupus. The 13CO and C18O 3-2 line fluxes increase over
time due to their optically thick emitting regions growing in size as the disk
expands viscously. The C18O 3-2 emission is optically thin throughout the disk
for only a subset of our models (Mdisk (t = 1 Myr) < 1e-3 Msun). For these
disks the integrated C18O flux decreases with time, similar to the disk mass.
The C18O 3-2 fluxes for the bulk of the disks in Lupus (with Mdust < 5e-5 Msun)
can be reproduced to within a factor of ~2 with viscously evolving disks in
which CO is converted into other species through grain-surface chemistry driven
by a cosmic-ray ionization rate zeta_cr ~ 5e-17 - 1e-16 s^-1. However,
explaining the stacked C18O upper limits requires a lower average abundance
than our models can produce and they cannot explain the observed 13CO fluxes,
which, for most disks, are more than an order of magnitude fainter than what
our models predict. Reconciling the 13CO fluxes of viscously evolving disks
with the observations requires either a combination of efficient vertical
mixing and a high zeta_cr or low mass disks (Mdust < 3e-5 Msun) being much
thinner and/or smaller than their more massive counterparts.

The importance of anti-unitary symmetries such as time reversal was recognized

have been seen to lead to a vast range of possible topologically nontrivial
band structures many of which are realized in materials. In this paper we show
that band topology is further enriched in many physically realizable instances

are the spin-space groups. Here we describe cases where spin-space groups are
essential to understand the band topology in magnetic materials. We then focus
on magnon band topology where the theory of spin-space groups has its simplest
realization. We consider magnetic Hamiltonians with various types of coupling
including Heisenberg and Kitaev couplings revealing a hierarchy of enhanced
magnetic symmetry groups depending on the nature of the lattice and the

system is unidentifiable, the estimation procedure may fail or produce
erroneous and misleading results.

much less effort has been given to developing \emph{quantitative} (continuous)

in which the data are presented as a single trajectory beginning with one

  In this paper, we first derived a closed-form representation of linear ODE
systems that are not identifiable based on a single trajectory. This
representation helps researchers design practical systems and choose the right
prior structural information in practice. Next, we proposed several
quantitative scores for identifiability analysis in practice. In simulation
studies, the proposed measures outperformed the main competing method
significantly, especially when noise was presented in the data. We also
discussed the asymptotic properties of practical identifiability for

electric system consumption, production, import, and export data in near

minimize the data adjustments required to satisfy energy conservation
equations. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by applying it to

problem allows the formation of an instability of a thermal nature. There is no
external magnetic field inside the current layer in equilibrium state, but it
can penetrate inside when the current layer is disturbed. Formation of a
magnetic field perturbation inside the layer creates a dedicated frequency in a
broadband disturbance subject to thermal instability. In the linear phase, the
growth time of the instability is proportional to the characteristic time of
radiative cooling of plasma and depends on the logarithmic derivatives of the
radiative cooling function with respect to the plasma parameters. The
instability results in transverse fragmentation of the current layer with a
spatial period of 1-10 Mm along the layer in a wide range of coronal plasma

desirable axioms for resource quantification have been extensively studied
through axiomatic approaches. However, a conventional way of resource
quantification by resource measures with such desired axioms may contradict
rates of asymptotic transformation between resourceful quantum states due to an
approximation in the transformation. In this paper, we establish an alternative
axiom, asymptotic consistency of resource measures, and we investigate
asymptotically consistent resource measures, which quantify resources without
contradicting the rates of the asymptotic resource transformation. We prove
that relative entropic measures are consistent with the rates for a broad class
of resources, i.e., all convex finite-dimensional resources, e.g.,
entanglement, coherence, and magic, and even some nonconvex or
infinite-dimensional resources such as quantum discord, non-Markovianity, and
non-Gaussianity. These results show that consistent resource measures are
widely applicable to the quantitative analysis of various inherent

In this limit, the localized dissipation gives rise to an effective delta

characterize the effect of dissipation for several theoretically relevant

inhomogeneous state obtained by joining two Fermi seas. In this latter setting,
when both gain and loss processes are present, we observe the emergence of
exotic nonequilibrium steady states with stepwise uniform density profiles. In
all instances, for strong dissipation the coherent dynamics of the system is
arrested, which is a manifestation of the celebrated quantum Zeno effect.

studies show that activity levels are largely determined by the stellar Rossby
number which is defined as the rotation period divided by the convective
turnover time. However, we currently have little information on the role that
chemical composition plays. In this work, we investigate how metallicity
affects magnetic activity using photometric variability as an activity proxy.
Similarly to other proxies, we demonstrate that the amplitude of photometric
variability is well parameterised by the Rossby number, although in a more
complex way. We also show that variability amplitude and metallicity are
generally positively correlated. This trend can be understood in terms of the
effect that metallicity has on stellar structure and, hence, the convective
turnover time (or, equivalently, the Rossby number). Lastly, we demonstrate
that the metallicity dependence of photometric variability results in a
rotation period detection bias whereby the periods of metal-rich stars are more
easily recovered for stars of a given mass.

focus is on the quantitative comparison between the level sensitivity
statistics and the level statistics. While the former studies the sensitivity
of Hamiltonian eigenlevels upon inserting a magnetic flux, the latter studies
the properties of unperturbed eigenlevels. We define two versions of
dimensionless conductance, the first corresponding to the width of the level
curvature distribution relative to the mean level spacing, and the second
corresponding to the ratio of the Heisenberg and the Thouless time obtained
from the spectral form factor. We show that both conductances look remarkably
similar around the localization transition, in particular, they predict a
nearly identical critical point consistent with other measures of the
transition. We then study some further properties of those quantities: for
level curvatures, we discuss particular similarities and differences between
the width of the level curvature distribution and the characteristic energy
studied by Edwards and Thouless in their pioneering work [J. Phys. C. 5, 807
(1972)]. In the context of the spectral form factor, we show that at the
critical point it enters a broad time-independent regime, in which its value is
consistent with the level compressibility obtained from the level variance.

crossover regime using the cost function minimization approach introduced in

sarcasm and sentiment detection persist to be challenging tasks in Arabic,
given the language's rich morphology, linguistic disparity and dialectal
variations. This paper proffers team SPPU-AASM's submission for the WANLP
ArSarcasm shared-task 2021, which centers around the sarcasm and sentiment
polarity detection of Arabic tweets. The study proposes a hybrid model,
combining sentence representations from AraBERT with static word vectors
trained on Arabic social media corpora. The proposed system achieves a
F1-sarcastic score of 0.62 and a F-PN score of 0.715 for the sarcasm and
sentiment detection tasks, respectively. Simulation results show that the
proposed system outperforms multiple existing approaches for both the tasks,
suggesting that the amalgamation of context-free and context-dependent text
representations can help capture complementary facets of word meaning in
Arabic. The system ranked second and tenth in the respective sub-tasks of
sarcasm detection and sentiment identification.

exchange in which a chemical potential drives compositional defects to

inward. We find that the nature of interactions between sites in a

particular, elastic deformations which accompany lattice-mismatched species
promote spatially modulated patterns in the composition. These same patterns
can be produced at equilibrium in core/shell nanocrystals, whose structure
mimics transient motifs observed in nonequilibrium trajectories. Moreover, the
core of such nanocrystals undergoes a phase transition - from modulated to

results help explain the varied patterns observed in heterostructured
nanocrystals produced by ion exchange and suggest principles for the rational

Efficient Concurrent Attention Networks (ECANets), directly capturing the
inherent long-range dependencies in omnidirectional imagery. In addition to the

and its dissipation can power the object luminosity. We describe a dissipation
mechanism which works faster than magnetic reconnection. The mechanism involves
two strong Alfv\'en waves with anti-aligned magnetic fields $\boldsymbol{B}_1$
and $\boldsymbol{B}_2$ that propagate in opposite directions along background
magnetic field $\boldsymbol{B}_0$ and collide. The collision forms a thin
current sheet perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{B}_0$, which absorbs the incoming
waves. The current sheet is sustained by electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$
breaking the magnetohydrodynamic condition $E<B$ and accelerating particles to
high energies. We demonstrate this mechanism with kinetic plasma simulations
using a simple setup of two symmetric plane waves with amplitude
$A=B_1/B_0=B_2/B_0$ propagating in a uniform $\boldsymbol{B}_0$. The mechanism
is activated when $A>1/2$. It dissipates a large fraction of the wave energy,
$f=(2A-1)/A^2$, reaching $100\%$ when $A=1$. The plane geometry allows one to
see the dissipation process in a one-dimensional simulation. We also perform
two-dimensional simulations, enabling spontaneous breaking of the plane
symmetry by the tearing instability of the current sheet. At moderate $A$ of
main interest the tearing instability is suppressed. Dissipation transitions to
normal, slower, magnetic reconnection at $A\gg 1$. The fast dissipation
described in this paper may occur in various objects with perturbed magnetic
fields, including magnetars, jets from accreting black holes, and pulsar wind
nebulae.

structural phases in biomolecules including folding of proteins. Since stable
knots are not so common in real proteins, the existence of stable knots in
semiflexible polymers has not been explored much. Here, via extensive replica
exchange Monte Carlo simulation we investigate the same for a bead-stick and a
bead-spring homopolymer model that covers the whole range from flexible to
stiff. We establish the fact that the presence of stable knotted phases in the
phase diagram is dependent on the ratio $r_b/r_{\rm{min}}$ where $r_b$ is the
equilibrium bond length and $r_{\rm{min}}$ is the distance for the strongest
nonbonded contacts. Our results provide evidence for both models that if the
ratio $r_b/r_{\rm{min}}$ is outside a small window around unity then depending
on the bending stiffness one always encounters stable knotted phases along with
the usual frozen and bent-like structures at low temperatures. These findings
prompt us to conclude that knots are generic stable phases in semiflexible
polymers.

observe that long bitlines and wordlines in a memristive crossbar are a major
source of parasitic voltage drops, which create current asymmetry. Through
circuit simulations, we show the significant endurance variation that results
from this asymmetry. Therefore, if the critical memristors (ones with lower
endurance) are overutilized, they may lead to a reduction of the crossbar's
lifetime. We propose eSpine, a novel technique to improve lifetime by
incorporating the endurance variation within each crossbar in mapping machine
learning workloads, ensuring that synapses with higher activation are always
implemented on memristors with higher endurance, and vice versa. eSpine works
in two steps. First, it uses the Kernighan-Lin Graph Partitioning algorithm to
partition a workload into clusters of neurons and synapses, where each cluster
can fit in a crossbar. Second, it uses an instance of Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) to map clusters to tiles, where the placement of synapses of
a cluster to memristors of a crossbar is performed by analyzing their
activation within the workload. We evaluate eSpine for a state-of-the-art

breaks the 90$^\circ$-rotation symmetry of the oxygen lattices. The peak

only if the direct link ceases to attain a certain information rate, thereby
improving the spectral efficiency. The path gain through the power line is
assumed to be log-normally distributed with high distance-dependent attenuation
and the additive noise is from a Bernoulli-Gaussian process. Closed-form
expressions for the outage probability, and approximate closed-form expressions
for the end-to-end average channel capacity and the average bit error rate for

model to explain the abundances observed in the atmospheres of 202 DZ white
dwarfs by considering the heating, geochemical differentiation, and collisional
processes experienced by the planetary bodies accreted, as well as
gravitational sinking. The majority (>60%) of systems are consistent with the
accretion of primitive material. We attribute the small spread in refractory
abundances observed to a similar spread in the initial planet-forming material,
as seen in the compositions of nearby stars. A range in Na abundances in the
pollutant material is attributed to a range in formation temperatures from
below 1,000K to higher than 1,400K, suggesting that pollutant material arrives
in white dwarf atmospheres from a variety of radial locations. We also find
that Solar System-like differentiation is common place in exo-planetary
systems. Extreme siderophile (Fe, Ni or Cr) abundances in 8 systems require the
accretion of a core-rich fragment of a larger differentiated body to at least a
3sigma significance, whilst one system shows evidence that it accreted a
crust-rich fragment. In systems where the abundances suggest that accretion has
finished (13/202), the total mass accreted can be calculated. The 13 systems

$2^\omega$? An obvious necessary condition is that a space can be partitioned
into copies of $2^\omega$ only if it can be covered with copies of $2^\omega$.
We prove three theorems concerning when this necessary condition is also
sufficient.
  If $X$ is a metrizable space and $|X| \leq \mathfrak{c}^{+\omega}$ (the least
limit cardinal $>\!\mathfrak{c}$), then $X$ can be partitioned into copies of
$2^\omega$ if and only if $X$ can be covered with copies of $2^\omega$. To show
this cardinality bound is sharp, we construct a metrizable space of size
$\mathfrak{c}^{+(\omega+1)}$ that can be covered with copies of $2^\omega$, but
not partitioned into copies of $2^\omega$.
  Similarly, if $X$ is first countable and $|X| \leq \mathfrak{c}$, then $X$
can be partitioned into copies of $2^\omega$ if and only if $X$ can be covered
with copies of $2^\omega$. On the other hand, there is a first countable space
of size $\mathfrak{c}^+$ that can be covered with copies of $2^\omega$, but not
partitioned into copies of $2^\omega$.
  Finally, we show that a completely metrizable space can be partitioned into

AST-splines to allow multiple extraordinary points within the same face. This
generalization drastically increases the flexibility to build geometries using
AST-splines; e.g., much coarser meshes can be generated to represent a certain
geometry. The AST-spline spaces detailed in this work have $C^1$ inter-element
continuity near extraordinary points and $C^2$ inter-element continuity
elsewhere. We mathematically show that AST-splines with multiple extraordinary

form a non-negative partition of unity. We numerically show that AST-splines
with multiple extraordinary points per face lead to optimal convergence rates

nuclear science. A conference in April 1943 at Los Alamos provided a simple
formula used to compute critical masses, and laid out the research program
needed to determine the key nuclear constants. In short order, four university
accelerators were disassembled and reassembled at Los Alamos, and methods were
established to make measurements on extremely small samples owing to the
initial lack of availability of enriched 235 U and plutonium. I trace the
program that measured fission cross sections, fission emitted neutron
multiplicities and their energy spectra, and transport cross sections,
comparing the measurements with our best understanding today as embodied in the
Evaluated Nuclear Data File ENDF/B-VIII.0. The large nuclear data uncertainties
at the beginning of the project, which often exceeded 25--50%, were reduced by
1945, often to less than 5-10%. 235 U and 239 Pu fission cross section
assessments in the fast MeV range were reduced with more accurate measurements,
and the neutron multiplicity increased. By a lucky coincidence of cancelling
errors, the initial critical mass estimates were close to the final estimated
masses. Some images from historical documents from our Los Alamos archives are
shown. Many of the original measurements from these early years have not
previously been widely available. Through this work, these data have now been
archived in the international experimental nuclear reaction data library
(EXFOR) in a collaboration with the IAEA and Brookhaven National Laboratory.

predict the appearance near the transition temperature $T_c$ of a well-resolved

below $T_c$ in the system's response to a driving pairing field. When
approaching $T_c$ from below, the phononic and pair-breaking branches,
characteristic of the zero temperature behavior, reduce to a very low
energy-momentum region when the pair correlation length reaches its critical
divergent behavior $\xi_{\rm pair}\propto|T_c-T|^{-1/2}$; elsewhere, they are
replaced by the quadratically-dispersed pairing resonance, which thus acts as a
precursor of the phase transition. In the strong-coupling and Bose-Einstein
Condensate regime, this mode is a weakly-damped propagating mode associated to
a Lorentzian resonance. Conversely, in the BCS limit it is a relaxation mode of
pure imaginary eigenenergy. At large momenta, the resonance disappears when it
is reabsorbed by the lower-edge of the pairing continuum. At intermediate
temperatures between 0 and $T_c$, we unify the newly found collective phenomena

the study of the absorbing X-ray column density. Joining Swift, XMM-Newton, and
NuSTAR observations, we find that the GRB X-ray spectrum is characterized by a
high column density that is well in excess of the expected Milky Way value and
decreases, by a factor of ~2, around ~$10^5$ s. Such a variability is not
common in GRBs. The most straightforward interpretation of the variability in
terms of photoionization of the ambient medium is not able to account for the
decrease at such late times, when the source flux is less intense. Instead, we
interpret the decrease as due to a clumped absorber, denser along the line of
sight and surrounded by lower-density gas. After the detection at TeV energies
of GRB 190114C, two other GRBs were promptly detected. They share a high value
of the intrinsic column density and there are hints for a decrease of the

attempts have been made to extend LB algorithms to this setting, they overlook
a salient feature of GLBs which flaws their results. In this work, we introduce
a new algorithm that addresses this difficulty. We prove that under a geometric

valley relaxation in two electrostatically-gated WSe$_2$ monolayers having
different dielectric environments. In a fully-encapsulated structure
(hBN/WSe$_2$/hBN, where hBN is hexagonal boron nitride), valley relaxation is
found to be monoexponential. The valley relaxation time $\tau_v$ is quite long
($\sim$10~$\mu$s) at low carrier densities, but decreases rapidly to less than
100~ns at high electron or hole densities $\gtrsim$2 $\times
10^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$. In contrast, in a partially-encapsulated WSe$_2$ monolayer
placed directly on silicon dioxide (hBN/WSe$_2$/SiO$_2$), carrier valley
relaxation is multi-exponential at low carrier densities. The difference is
attributed to environmental disorder from the SiO$_2$ substrate. Unexpectedly,
very small out-of-plane magnetic fields can increase $\tau_v$, especially in
the hBN/WSe$_2$/SiO$_2$ structure, suggesting that localized states induced by

a small fractional value of the nuclear magneton. Here we investigate the
adiabatic evolution of electronic states induced by lattice vibration of a
chiral phonon and obtain an electronic orbital magnetization in the form of a
topological second Chern form. We find that the traditional theory needs to be
refined by introducing a $\bm{k}$ resolved Born effective charge, and identify
another contribution from the phonon-modified electronic energy together with
the momentum-space Berry curvature. The second Chern form can diverge when
there is a Yang's monopole near the parameter space of interest as illustrated
by considering a phonon at the Brillouin zone corner in a gaped graphene model.
We also find large magnetic moments for the optical phonon in bulk topological
materials where non-topological contribution is also important. The magnetic
moment experiences a sign change when the band inversion happens.

idea that for modular recurrent networks, composed of columns with scalar

evolved since the birth of persistent homology in the early 2000s. The first
applications of topology to data emphasized the global shape of a dataset, such
as the three-circle model for $3 \times 3$ pixel patches from natural images,
or the configuration space of the cyclo-octane molecule, which is a sphere with
a Klein bottle attached via two circles of singularity. In these studies of
global shape, short persistent homology bars are disregarded as sampling noise.
More recently, however, persistent homology has been used to address questions
about the local geometry of data. For instance, how can local geometry be
vectorized for use in machine learning problems? Persistent homology and its
vectorization methods, including persistence landscapes and persistence images,
provide popular techniques for incorporating both local geometry and global
topology into machine learning. Our meta-hypothesis is that the short bars are
as important as the long bars for many machine learning tasks. In defense of
this claim, we survey applications of persistent homology to shape recognition,
agent-based modeling, materials science, archaeology, and biology.
Additionally, we survey work connecting persistent homology to geometric

from $\sim 0.53$ to $\sim 2$ ($\omega_{ce}$ and $\omega_{pe}$ are the electron
cyclotron and plasma frequencies, respectively). In the regime
$\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}\lesssim 1.2-1.7$ the instability is dominated by
oblique, quasi-electrostatic (OQES) modes, and the acceleration is inefficient.
When $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$ has grown to $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}\gtrsim
1.2-1.7$, electrons are efficiently accelerated by the inelastic scattering
provided by unstable parallel, electromagnetic z (PEMZ) modes. After
$\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$ reaches $\sim 2$, the electron energy spectra show
nonthermal tails that differ between the shearing and compressing cases. In the
shearing case, the tail resembles a power-law of index $\alpha_s \sim$ 2.9 plus
a high-energy bump reaching $\sim 300$ keV. In the compressing runs, $\alpha_s
\sim$ 3.7 with a spectral break above $\sim 500$ keV. This difference can be
explained by the different temperature evolutions in these two types of
simulations, suggesting a critical role played by the type of anisotropy
driving, $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$ and the electron temperature in the
efficiency of the acceleration.

in the presence of a photoionizing source. Line formation processes in one and
two-electron species are broadly categorized into four cases. Case A occurs
when the Lyman line optical depths are very small and photoexcitation does not
occur. Line photons escape the cloud without any scattering. Case B occurs when
the Lyman-line optical depths are large enough for photons to undergo multiple
scatterings. Case C occurs when a broadband continuum source strikes an
optically thin cloud. The Lyman lines are enhanced by induced radiative
excitation of the atoms/ions by continuum photons, also known as continuum
pumping. A fourth less-studied scenario, where the Case B spectrum is enhanced
by continuum pumping, is called Case D. Here, we establish the mathematical
foundation of Cases A, B, C, and D in an irradiated cloud with Cloudy. We also
show the total X-ray emission spectrum for all four cases within the energy
range 0.1 - 10 keV at the resolving power of XRISM around 6 keV. Additionally,
we show that a combined effect of electron scattering and partial blockage of
continuum pumping reduces the resonance line intensities. Such reduction
increases with column density and can serve as an important tool to measure the
column density/optical depth of the cloud.

from a double neutron star (NS) merger, and the remnant of such a merger may be
a supramassive NS, which is supported by rigid rotation and through its
survival of hundreds of seconds before collapsing into a black hole (BH). If
this is the case, an optical/infrared transient (namely merger-nova) is
generated from the ejected materials and it is powered by radioactive decay
from $r$-process, spin-down energy from a supramassive NS, as well as the
magnetic wind from a newborn BH. In this paper, we systematically search for
the signature of a supramassive NS central engine by analyzing the X-ray
emission of short GRBs with internal plateau observed by {\em Swift}, and we
find that five candidates of short GRBs have such feature with redshift

three energy sources, and compare its brightness with the sensitivity of some

IRS-assisted systems is quite challenging because of the passive
characteristics of the IRS. In this paper, we consider the problem of beam
training/alignment for IRS-assisted downlink mmWave/THz systems, where a
multi-antenna base station (BS) with a hybrid structure serves a single-antenna

sparse sensing and phaseless estimation problem, which involves devising a
sparse sensing matrix and developing an efficient estimation algorithm to
identify the best beam alignment from compressive phaseless measurements.
Theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed method can identify the best
alignment with only a modest amount of training overhead. Simulation results
show that, for both line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS scenarios, the proposed method
obtains a significant performance improvement over existing state-of-art
methods. Notably, it can achieve performance close to that of the exhaustive
beam search scheme, while reducing the training overhead by 95%.

distributed multi-agent (PDMA) automatic generation control (AGC) in islanded
microgrids against stochastic communication disruptions. The target microgrid
is construed as a cyber-physical system, wherein the physical microgrid is
modeled as an inverter-interfaced autonomous grid with detailed system dynamic
formulation, and the communication network topology is regarded as a
cyber-system independent of its physical connection. The primal goal of the
proposed method is to decide the minimum number of generators to be pinned and
their identities amongst all distributed generators (DGs). The pinningdecisions
are made based on complex network theories using the genetic algorithm (GA),
for the purpose of synchronizing and regulating the frequencies and voltages of
all generator busbars in a PDMA control structure, i.e., without resorting to a
central AGC agent. Thereafter, the mapping of cyber-system topology and the
pinning decision is constructed using deeplearning (DL) technique, so that the
pinning-decision can be made nearly instantly upon detecting a new cyber-system
topology after stochastic communication disruptions. The proposed
decision-making approach is verified using a 10-generator, 38-bus microgrid
through time-domain simulation for transient stability analysis.

low-level instructions with success on high-level tasks. We learn the
termination classifier offline from pairs of instructions and terminal states.
Notably, in departure from prior work in language and abstraction, we learn the
relevance classifier online, without relying on an explicit decomposition of

  Outcomes",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many policies allocate harms or benefits that are uncertain in nature: they
produce distributions over the population in which individuals have different
probabilities of incurring harm or benefit. Comparing different policies thus
involves a comparison of their corresponding probability distributions, and we
observe that in many instances the policies selected in practice are hard to
explain by preferences based only on the expected value of the total harm or
benefit they produce. In cases where the expected value analysis is not a
sufficient explanatory framework, what would be a reasonable model for societal
preferences over these distributions? Here we investigate explanations based on
the framework of probability weighting from the behavioral sciences, which over
several decades has identified systematic biases in how people perceive
probabilities. We show that probability weighting can be used to make
predictions about preferences over probabilistic distributions of harm and
benefit that function quite differently from expected-value analysis, and in a
number of cases provide potential explanations for policy preferences that
appear hard to motivate by other means. In particular, we identify optimal
policies for minimizing perceived total harm and maximizing perceived total
benefit that take the distorting effects of probability weighting into account,
and we discuss a number of real-world policies that resemble such allocational
strategies. Our analysis does not provide specific recommendations for policy
choices, but is instead fundamentally interpretive in nature, seeking to
describe observed phenomena in policy choices.

congruency, which depicts how much each Fourier components of the image are
congruent in phase. Instead of using fixed bases in phase congruency, the
spectrum congruency measures the congruency of the energy distribution of
multiscale patches in a data-driven transform domain, which is more adaptable
to the input images. Multiscale image patches are used to acquire different
frequency components for modeling the local energy and amplitude. The spectrum
congruency coincides nicely with human visions of perceiving features and
provides a more reliable way of detecting edges. Unlike most existing
differential-based multiscale edge detectors which simply combine the

channel attacks, with the anticipation of obtaining more appreciable attack
results. Most of them concentrate on improving network architectures or putting
forward novel algorithms, assuming that there are adequate profiling traces
available to train an appropriate neural network. However, in practical
scenarios, profiling traces are probably insufficient, which makes the network
learn deficiently and compromises attack performance.
  In this paper, we investigate a kind of data augmentation technique, called
mixup, and first propose to exploit it in deep-learning based side channel
attacks, for the purpose of expanding the profiling set and facilitating the
chances of mounting a successful attack. We perform Correlation Power Analysis
for generated traces and original traces, and discover that there exists
consistency between them regarding leakage information. Our experiments show
that mixup is truly capable of enhancing attack performance especially for
insufficient profiling traces. Specifically, when the size of the training set
is decreased to 30% of the original set, mixup can significantly reduce
acquired attacking traces. We test three mixup parameter values and conclude
that generally all of them can bring about improvements. Besides, we compare
three leakage models and unexpectedly find that least significant bit model,
which is less frequently used in previous works, actually surpasses prevalent
identity model and hamming weight model in terms of attack results.

deduce the area and open flux of a near-disk center CH observed on 9/19/2010,
and applying a single method to five different EUV filtergrams for this CH.
Open flux was calculated using five different magnetic maps. The standard
deviation (interpreted as the uncertainty) in the open flux estimate for this
CH was about 26%. However, including the variability of different magnetic data
sources, this uncertainty almost doubles to 45%. We use two of the methods to
characterize the area and open flux for all CHs in this time period. We find
that the open flux is greatly underestimated compared to values inferred from
in-situ measurements (by 2.2-4 times). We also test our detection techniques on
simulated emission images from a thermodynamic MHD model of the solar corona.
We find that the methods overestimate the area and open flux in the simulated
CH, but the average error in the flux is only about 7%. The full-Sun detections
on the simulated corona underestimate the model open flux, but by factors well
below what is needed to account for the missing flux in the observations.
Under-detection of open flux in coronal holes likely contributes to the

emission and absorption process, especially dressing of a quark, contributes to
$g(x)$ and modifies $q(x)$. Guided by long-established results for the
parton-in-parton distributions from a strict 1-loop perturbative analysis of a

Rainbow-Ladder truncation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations to describe the
interrelated valence $q_{\rm v}(x)$ and the dressing-gluon $g(x)$ for a hadron

particular, are affected by bias based on gender and other demographic
elements. As language models are increasingly applied to medicine, there is a
growing interest in building algorithmic fairness into processes impacting
patient care. Much of the work addressing this question has focused on biases
encoded in language models -- statistical estimates of the relationships
between concepts derived from distant reading of corpora. Building on this
work, we investigate how word choices made by healthcare practitioners and
language models interact with regards to bias. We identify and remove gendered
language from two clinical-note datasets and describe a new debiasing procedure
using BERT-based gender classifiers. We show minimal degradation in health
condition classification tasks for low- to medium-levels of bias removal via
data augmentation. Finally, we compare the bias semantically encoded in the
language models with the bias empirically observed in health records. This work
outlines an interpretable approach for using data augmentation to identify and
reduce the potential for bias in natural language processing pipelines.

two-stage framework, in which reinforcement learning (RL) and traditional
operations research (OR) algorithms are combined together to efficiently deal
with complex scheduling problems. The scheduling problem is solved in two
stages, including a finite Markov decision process (MDP) and a mixed-integer
programming process, respectively. This offers a novel and general paradigm
that combines RL with OR approaches to solving scheduling problems, which
leverages the respective strengths of RL and OR: The MDP narrows down the
search space of the original problem through an RL method, while the
mixed-integer programming process is settled by an OR algorithm. These two
stages are performed iteratively and interactively until the termination

properties of rare-earth metals and intermetallics, including heavy fermions
and mix-valent compounds, and is normally realized by the many-body Kondo
coupling between 4f and conduction electrons. Due to the large onsite Coulomb
repulsion of 4f electrons, the bandwidth-control Mott-type delocalization,
commonly observed in d-electron systems, is difficult in 4f-electron systems
and remains elusive in spectroscopic experiments. Here we demonstrate that the
bandwidth-control orbital-selective delocalization of 4f electrons can be
realized in epitaxial Ce films by thermal annealing, which results in a
metastable surface phase with a reduced layer spacing. The resulting
quasiparticle bands exhibit large dispersion with exclusive 4f character near
E_F and extend reasonably far below the Fermi energy, which can be explained
from the Mott physics. The experimental quasiparticle dispersion agrees
surprisingly well with density-functional theory calculation and also exhibits
unusual temperature dependence, which could be a direct consequence of the
delicate interplay between the bandwidth-control Mott physics and the
coexisting Kondo hybridization. Our work therefore opens up the opportunity to
study the interaction between two well-known localization-delocalization

robust optimization, and stochastic optimization to minimize the daily

operating requirement. Considering the uncertainties from ambient temperature,
a Wasserstein metric-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method is
proposed to enhance the robustness of the optimal schedule against the
uncertainty of probabilistic prediction errors. The schedule is optimized under
the worst-case distribution within an ambiguity set defined by the Wasserstein
metric. The proposed DRO method is initially formulated as a two-stage problem
and then reformulated into a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
form. The paper evaluates the feasibility and optimality of the optimized
schedules for a real commercial building. The numerical results indicate that
the costs of the proposed DRO method are up to 6.6% lower compared with
conventional techniques of optimization under uncertainties. They also provide
granular risk-benefit options for decision making in demand response programs.

strong skew in their offspring number distribution. The skew arises because the
variability of family sizes is either inherently strong or amplified by
population expansions, leading to so-called `jackpot' events. The resulting
allele frequency fluctuations are large and, therefore, challenge standard
models of population genetics, which assume sufficiently narrow offspring
distributions. While the neutral dynamics backward in time can be readily
analyzed using coalescent approaches, we still know little about the effect of
broad offspring distributions on the dynamics forward in time, especially with
selection. Here, we employ an exact asymptotic analysis combined with a scaling
hypothesis to demonstrate that over-dispersed frequency trajectories emerge
from the competition of conventional forces, such as selection or mutations,
with an emerging time-dependent sampling bias against the minor allele. The
sampling bias arises from the characteristic time-dependence of the largest
sampled family size within each allelic type. Using this insight, we establish
simple scaling relations for allele frequency fluctuations, fixation
probabilities, extinction times, and the site frequency spectra that arise when
offspring numbers are distributed according to a power law $~n^{-(1+\alpha)}$.
To demonstrate that this coarse-grained model captures a wide variety of
non-equilibrium dynamics, we validate our results in traveling waves, where the
phenomenon of 'gene surfing' can produce any exponent $1<\alpha <2$. We argue
that the concept of a dynamic sampling bias is useful generally to develop both
intuition and statistical tests for the unusual dynamics of populations with
skewed offspring distributions, which can confound commonly used tests for
selection or demographic history.

points $x$ are known as importance weights or propensity scores and play a
fundamental role in many different fields, most notably, statistics and machine
learning. Among its applications, importance weights are central to domain
adaptation, anomaly detection, and estimations of various divergences such as
the KL divergence. We consider the common setting where $R$ and $P$ are only
given through samples from each distribution. The vast literature on estimating
importance weights is either heuristic, or makes strong assumptions about $R$
and $P$ or on the importance weights themselves.
  In this paper, we explore a computational perspective to the estimation of
importance weights, which factors in the limitations and possibilities
obtainable with bounded computational resources. We significantly strengthen
previous work that use the MaxEntropy approach, that define the importance
weights based on a distribution $Q$ closest to $P$, that looks the same as $R$
on every set $C \in \mathcal{C}$, where $\mathcal{C}$ may be a huge collection
of sets. We show that the MaxEntropy approach may fail to assign high average
scores to sets $C \in \mathcal{C}$, even when the average of ground truth
weights for the set is evidently large. We similarly show that it may
overestimate the average scores to sets $C \in \mathcal{C}$. We therefore
formulate Sandwiching bounds as a notion of set-wise accuracy for importance
weights. We study these bounds to show that they capture natural completeness
and soundness requirements from the weights. We present an efficient algorithm
that under standard learnability assumptions computes weights which satisfy
these bounds. Our techniques rely on a new notion of multicalibrated partitions
of the domain of the distributions, which appear to be useful objects in their
own right.

Presently, several privacy-preserving deep learning methods have been proposed,
but most of them suffer from a non-negligible degradation of either efficiency

inference. We demonstrate that the computational complexity of NegDL is the
same as the original deep learning model without privacy protection.
Experimental results on Breast Cancer, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the accuracy of NegDL could be comparable to the original deep

between images in the training set. Then, the manifold relationship between
instances and the pruned sub-networks will be aligned in the training

those methods are not robust when applied to biased and noisy data. To overcome

implicit differentiation. We develop a theoretical probabilistic interpretation
of this framework using Fisher information and show that its complexity scales
linearly with the dataset size. Our experiments on SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and
ImageNet classification show up to 9.3% improvement for biased datasets with

problem, with numerous applications in many areas of computer science.
Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is one of the most popular solution approaches
for ANNS. A common shortcoming of many LSH schemes is that since they probe
only a single bucket in a hash table, they need to use a large number of hash
tables to achieve a high query accuracy. For ANNS-$L_2$, a multi-probe scheme
was proposed to overcome this drawback by strategically probing multiple
buckets in a hash table. In this work, we propose MP-RW-LSH, the first and so
far only multi-probe LSH solution to ANNS in $L_1$ distance. Another
contribution of this work is to explain why a state-of-the-art ANNS-$L_1$
solution called Cauchy projection LSH (CP-LSH) is fundamentally not suitable
for multi-probe extension. We show that MP-RW-LSH uses 15 to 53 times fewer
hash tables than CP-LSH for achieving similar query accuracies.

costs, which in general have not been properly compensated by the users'
transaction fees. This reduces the incentives for the miners' participation and
may jeopardize the blockchain security. We propose to mitigate this blockchain
insufficient fee issue through a Fee and Waiting Tax (FWT) mechanism, which
explicitly considers the two types of negative externalities in the system.
Specifically, we model the interactions between the protocol designer, users,
and miners as a three-stage Stackelberg game. By characterizing the equilibrium
of the game, we find that miners neglecting the negative externality in
transaction selection cause they are willing to accept insufficient-fee
transactions. This leads to the insufficient storage fee issue in the existing
protocol. Moreover, our proposed optimal FWT mechanism can motivate users to
pay sufficient transaction fees to cover the storage costs and achieve the
unconstrained social optimum. Numerical results show that the optimal FWT
mechanism guarantees sufficient transaction fees and achieves an average social
welfare improvement of 33.73\% or more over the existing protocol. Furthermore,
the optimal FWT mechanism achieves the maximum fairness index and performs well
even under heterogeneous-storage-cost miners.

Simplistic tight-binding model allows for description of single-electron

tight-binding model omits the integro-differential equations that arise from
electron-electron interaction in Schroedinger model. Two approaches are given
in derivation of tight-binding model from Schroedinger equation. First approach
is conducted by usage of Green functions obtained from Schroedinger equation.
Second approach is given by usage of Taylor expansion applied to Schroedinger
equation. The obtained results can be extended for the case of many Wannier

  preprint",,"10.1007/s10690-022-09358-8",,"q-fin.PM stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Managing a large-scale portfolio with many assets is one of the most
challenging tasks in the field of finance. It is partly because estimation of
either covariance or precision matrix of asset returns tends to be unstable or
even infeasible when the number of assets $p$ exceeds the number of
observations $n$. For this reason, most of the previous studies on portfolio
management have focused on the case of$ p < n$. To deal with the case of $p >
n$, we propose to use a new Bayesian framework based on adaptive graphical
LASSO for estimating the precision matrix of asset returns in a large-scale
portfolio. Unlike the previous studies on graphical LASSO in the literature,
our approach utilizes a Bayesian estimation method for the precision matrix
proposed by Oya and Nakatsuma (2022) so that the positive definiteness of the
precision matrix should be always guaranteed. As an empirical application, we
construct the global minimum variance portfolio of $p = 100$ for various values
of n with the proposed approach as well as the non-Bayesian graphical LASSO
approach, and compare their out-of-sample performance with the equal weight
portfolio as the benchmark. In this comparison, the proposed approach produces
more stable results than the non-Bayesian approach in terms of Sharpe ratio,
portfolio composition and turnover. Furthermore, the proposed approach succeeds
in estimating the precision matrix even if $n$ is much smaller than $p$ and the
non-Bayesian approach fails to do so.

observations, even if the galaxy has a perfectly symmetric structure. {Taking
advantage of the integral field spectroscopic data observed by the SDSS-IV
MaNGA survey, we investigate the asymmetries of the emission-line and continuum
maps of star-forming disk galaxies.} We define new parameters, $A_a$ and $A_b$,
to estimate the asymmetries of a galaxy about its major and minor axes,
respectively. Comparing $A_a$ and $A_b$ in different inclination bins, we
attempt to detect the asymmetries caused by dust. For the continuum images, we
find that $A_a$ increases with the inclination, while the $A_b$ is a constant
as inclination changes. Similar trends are found for $g-r$, $g-i$ and $r-i$
color images. The dependence of the asymmetry on inclination suggests a thin
dust layer with a scale height smaller than the stellar populations. For the
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ images, neither $A_a$ nor $A_b$ shows a significant
correlation with inclination. Also, we do not find any significant dependence
of the asymmetry of $E(B-V)_g$ on inclination, implying that the dust in the
thick disk component is not significant. Compared to the SKIRT simulation, the
results suggest that the thin dust disk has an optical depth $\tau_V\sim0.2$.
This is the first time that the asymmetries caused by the dust attenuation and
the inclination are probed statistically with a large sample. Our results
indicate that the combination of the dust attenuation and the inclination
effects is a potential indicator of the 3D disk orientation.

in several applications including reinforcement learning (RL) and time-series

received little attention. Standard streaming methods like stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) are unlikely to work since streaming points can be highly
correlated. In this work, we propose a novel streaming algorithm, SGD with
Reverse Experience Replay ($\mathsf{SGD}-\mathsf{RER}$), that is inspired by
the experience replay (ER) technique popular in the RL literature.
$\mathsf{SGD}-\mathsf{RER}$ divides data into small buffers and runs SGD
backwards on the data stored in the individual buffers. We show that this
algorithm exactly deconstructs the dependency structure and obtains information
theoretically optimal guarantees for both parameter error and prediction error.
Thus, we provide the first -- to the best of our knowledge -- optimal SGD-style

first order oracle. Furthermore, $\mathsf{SGD}-\mathsf{RER}$ can be applied to
more general settings like sparse LTI identification with known sparsity

2D Janus MoSSe with titanium doping and vacancies to explore their synergistic
effects on photocatalytic activity. We find that there are effective
attractions between the substituted or adsorbed Ti atoms and S/Se vacancies.
The Ti adatoms dramatically extend the light absorption range to infrared
region. The S/Se vacancies coexisting with Ti adatoms will modulate the
transition of photo-excited electrons, thereby enhancing the sunlight
absorption. The Ti adatoms either existing alone or coexisting with vacancies
introduce smaller lattice distortion compared to substituted Ti atoms and these
Ti adatoms induce smaller effective mass of charge carriers. The configuration
of S vacancy coexisting with Ti adatoms on Se-surface exhibits the most
significant synergistic effects and best overall photocatalytic performance.
Our work reveals the mechanism and effects induced by doping and vacancies
coexisting in 2D Janus TMDCs, also propose a new practical strategy to improve
the performance of 2D photocatalysts.

applied in the plane where electrons are confined. This phenomenon known as
planar Hall effect is accompanied by dependencies of both the longitudinal and
the transverse components of the current on the angle $\phi$ between the bias
direction and the magnetic field. In 2DEG with spin orbit coupling (SOC) such
as oxide interfaces, this effect has been experimentally witnessed. Further, a
fourfold oscillation in longitudinal resistance as a function of $\phi$ has
also been observed. Motivated by these, we perform scattering theory
calculations on a 2DEG with SOC in presence of an in-plane magnetic field
connected to two dimensional leads on either sides to obtain longitudinal and
transverse conductances. We find that the longitudinal conductance is
$\pi$-periodic and the transverse conductance is $2\pi$-periodic in $\phi$. The
magnitude of oscillation in transverse conductance with $\phi$ is enhanced in
certain patches in $(\alpha,b)$-plane where $\alpha$ is the strength of SOC and
$b$ is Zeeman energy due to magnetic field. The oscillation in transverse
conductance with $\phi$ can be highly multi-fold for large values of $\alpha$

to Fabry-P\'erot type interference between the modes in the central region as
backed by its length dependent features. Our study establishes that SOC in a
material is sufficient to observe planar Hall effect without the need for
anisotropic magnetic ordering or nontrivial topology of the bandstructure.

Given a video sequence as an input sample, we improve the temporal feature
representations of MoCo from two perspectives. First, we introduce a generator
to drop out several frames from this sample temporally. The discriminator is
then learned to encode similar feature representations regardless of frame
removals. By adaptively dropping out different frames during training
iterations of adversarial learning, we augment this input sample to train a
temporally robust encoder. Second, we use temporal decay to model key
attenuation in the memory queue when computing the contrastive loss. As the
momentum encoder updates after keys enqueue, the representation ability of
these keys degrades when we use the current input sample for contrastive
learning. This degradation is reflected via temporal decay to attend the input
sample to recent keys in the queue. As a result, we adapt MoCo to learn video
representations without empirically designing pretext tasks. By empowering the
temporal robustness of the encoder and modeling the temporal decay of the keys,
our VideoMoCo improves MoCo temporally based on contrastive learning.
Experiments on benchmark datasets including UCF101 and HMDB51 show that
VideoMoCo stands as a state-of-the-art video representation learning method.

control systems (a.k.a. continuous-space POMDPs). Given an estimator, we
utilize a discretization-free approach to synthesize controllers ensuring
safety specifications over finite-time horizons. The proposed framework is
based on a notion of so-called local control barrier functions computed for
subsystems in two different ways. In the first scheme, no prior knowledge of
estimation accuracy is needed. The second framework utilizes a probability
bound on the estimation accuracy using a notion of so called stochastic
simulation functions. In both proposed schemes, we drive sufficient small-gain
type conditions in order to compositionally construct control barrier functions
for interconnected POMDPs using local barrier functions computed for
subsystems. Leveraging compositionality results, the constructed control
barrier functions enable us to compute lower bounds on the probabilities that
the interconnected POMDPs avoid certain unsafe regions in finite-time horizons.

studied in both network models and real networks. The CNR remains unchanged in
different sized Erd\""os R\'enyi (ER) networks with the same average degree, and
increases with the average degree, which yields a critical turning point. The
approximate analytical solutions of CNR in ER networks are given, which fits
the simulations well. Furthermore, the difference between CNR and two-core

profile is harder to obtain especially when a real robot is unavailable. It is
difficult to obtain a realistic force profile in simulation even with physics

framework that combines hierarchical imitation learning, to learn the nominal

learn an optimal force control policy, that can satisfy the nominal trajectory
while adapting to the force requirement of the assembly task. To further
improve the imitation learning part, we develop a hierarchical architecture,

safe driving and the downstream tasks of autonomous vehicles.
  Traditional methods infer scene category by detecting scene-related objects
or using a classifier that is trained on large datasets of fine-labeled scene
images.
  Whereas at cluttered dynamic scenes such as campus or park, human activities
are not strongly confined by rules, and the functional attributes of places are
not strongly correlated with objects. So how to define, model and infer scene
categories is crucial to make the technique really helpful in assisting a robot
to pass through the scene.
  This paper proposes a method of task-driven driving scene categorization
using weakly supervised data.
  Given a front-view video of a driving scene, a set of anchor points is marked
by following the decision making of a human driver, where an anchor point is
not a semantic label but an indicator meaning the semantic attribute of the
scene is different from that of the previous one.
  A measure is learned to discriminate the scenes of different semantic
attributes via contrastive learning, and a driving scene profiling and
categorization method is developed based on that measure.
  Experiments are conducted on a front-view video that is recorded when a
vehicle passed through the cluttered dynamic campus of Peking University. The
scenes are categorized into straight road, turn road and alerting traffic. The
results of semantic scene similarity learning and driving scene categorization
are extensively studied, and positive result of scene categorization is 97.17
\% on the learning video and 85.44\% on the video of new scenes.

several benefits, such as sufficient expressiveness, the flexibility to inject

policies faces several computational challenges. In this work, we re-examine
the message passing algorithm of RMPflow and propose a more efficient alternate

the strengths of RMPflow while bringing in advantages from automatic
differentiation, including 1) easy programming interfaces to designing complex

transformation structures; 3) end-to-end differentiability for policy learning;
4) improved computational efficiency. Because of these features, RMP2 can be
treated as a structured policy class for efficient robot learning which is
suitable encoding domain knowledge. Our experiments show that using structured

of the Brussels-Montreal microscopic nuclear mass models, which mainly differ
in their predictions for the value of the symmetry energy $J$ and its slope $L$
in infinite homogeneous nuclear matter at saturation. Although some
correlations between on the one hand the neutron-drip density, the pressure,
the proton fraction and on the other hand $J$ (or equivalently $L$) are found,
these correlations are radically different in nonaccreting and accreting
neutron stars. In particular, the neutron-drip density is found to increase
with $L$ in the former case, but decreases in the latter case depending on the
composition of ashes from x-ray bursts and superbursts. We have qualitatively
explained these different behaviors using a simple mass formula. We have also
shown that the details of the nuclear structure may play a more important role

quantum spin liquid represent a highly nontrivial and interesting problem. A
theoretical proposal of extended modulated spin structures induced by doping of
such magnets, distinct from the well-known skyrmions has attracted significant
interest. Here, we demonstrate that nonmagnetic impurities can produce such
extended spin structures in h-YMnO3, a triangular antiferromagnet with
noncollinear magnetic order. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS), we
measured the full dynamical structure factor in Al-doped h-YMnO3 and confirmed
the presence of magnon damping with a clear momentum dependence. Our
theoretical calculations can reproduce the key features of the INS data,
supporting the formation of the proposed spin textures. As such, our study
provides the first experimental confirmation of the impurity-induced spin
textures. It offers new insights and understanding of the impurity effects in a
broad class of noncollinear magnetic systems.

Hofstetter independently showed that all such solutions can be obtained by
flipping an arbitrary set of complex zeros across the real line. This operation
is called zero-flipping and we denote by $\mathfrak{F}_a f$ the resulting

zero of $f$, that is if we make an error on the location of the zero. Our main
goal is to investigate the effect of $\mathfrak{F}_a$. We show that
$\mathfrak{F}_af$ is no longer bandlimited but is still wide-banded. We then
investigate the effect of $\mathfrak{F}_a$ on the stability of phase retrieval
by estimating the quantity $\inf_{|c|=1}\|cf-\mathfrak{F}_af\|_2$. We show that
this quantity is in general not well-suited to investigate stability, and so we
introduce the quantity $\inf_{|c|=1}\|c\mathfrak{F}_bf-\mathfrak{F}_af\|_2$. We
show that this quantity is dominated by the distance between $a$ and $b$.

there exists an injective endomorphism $\varphi: \Gamma \to \Gamma$ with the
image $\varphi(\Gamma)$ of finite index in $\Gamma$ and the subgroup
$\displaystyle \bigcap_{n>0}\varphi^n(\Gamma)$ finite. The only known examples
of such groups are virtually nilpotent, or equivalently, all examples have
polynomial growth. A question by Nekrashevych and Pete asks whether these
groups are the only possibilities for such endomorphisms, motivated by the
positive answer due to Gromov in the special case of expanding group morphisms.
  In this paper, we study this question for the class of virtually polycyclic
groups, i.e. the virtually solvable groups for which every subgroup is finitely
generated. Using the $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic hull, which allows us to extend the
injective endomorphisms of certain virtually polycyclic groups to a linear
algebraic group, we show that the existence of such an endomorphism implies
that the group is virtually nilpotent. Moreover, we fully characterize which
virtually nilpotent groups have a morphism satisfying the condition above,
related to the existence of a positive grading on the corresponding radicable
nilpotent group. As another application of the methods, we generalize a result
of Fel'shtyn and Lee about which maps on infra-solvmanifolds can have finite
Reidemeister number for all iterates.

However, computation of the SA metric for a test suite can be prohibitively

we developed and released a performance-optimized, but functionally equivalent,
implementation of SA, reducing the evaluation time by up to 97\%. We also
propose refined variants of the SA omputation algorithm, aiming to further
increase the evaluation speed. We then performed an empirical study on MNIST,
focused on the out-of-distribution detection capabilities of SA, which allowed
us to reproduce parts of the results presented when SA was first released. The

an overlooked issue of SA: it can be highly sensitive to the non-determinism

competitive performance in medical image analysis tasks, such as disease
classification, tumor segmentation, and lesion detection. CNN has great
advantages in extracting local features of images. However, due to the locality
of convolution operation, it can not deal with long-range relationships well.
Recently, transformers have been applied to computer vision and achieved
remarkable success in large-scale datasets. Compared with natural images,
multi-modal medical images have explicit and important long-range dependencies,
and effective multi-modal fusion strategies can greatly improve the performance
of deep models. This prompts us to study transformer-based structures and apply
them to multi-modal medical images. Existing transformer-based network
architectures require large-scale datasets to achieve better performance.
However, medical imaging datasets are relatively small, which makes it
difficult to apply pure transformers to medical image analysis. Therefore, we
propose TransMed for multi-modal medical image classification. TransMed
combines the advantages of CNN and transformer to efficiently extract low-level
features of images and establish long-range dependencies between modalities. We
evaluated our model for the challenging problem of preoperative diagnosis of
parotid gland tumors, and the experimental results show the advantages of our
proposed method. We argue that the combination of CNN and transformer has
tremendous potential in a large number of medical image analysis tasks. To our
best knowledge, this is the first work to apply transformers to medical image

accompanied by accelerated electrons that can in turn emit radiation at radio
wavelengths. This radiation is observed as solar radio bursts. The main types
of bursts associated with CMEs are type II and type IV bursts that can
sometimes show movement in the direction of the CME expansion, either radially
or laterally. However, the propagation of radio bursts with respect to CMEs has
only been studied for individual events. Aims: Here, we perform a statistical
study of 64 moving bursts with the aim to determine how often CMEs are
accompanied by moving radio bursts. This is done in order to ascertain the
usefulness of using radio images in estimating the early CME expansion.
Methods: Using radio imaging from the Na\c{c}ay Radioheliograph (NRH), we
constructed a list of moving radio bursts, defined as bursts that move across
the plane of sky at a single frequency. We define their association with CMEs
and the properties of associated CMEs using white-light coronagraph
observations. We also determine their connection to classical type II and type
IV radio burst categorisation. Results: We find that just over a quarter of
type II and half of type IV bursts that occurred during the NRH observing
windows in Solar Cycle 24 are accompanied by moving radio emission. All but one
of the moving radio bursts are associated with white--light CMEs and the
majority of moving bursts (90%) are associated with wide CMEs (>60 degrees in
width). In particular, all but one of the moving bursts corresponding to type
IIs are associated with wide CMEs; however, and unexpectedly, the majority of
type II moving bursts are associated with slow white-light CMEs (<500 km/s). On
the other hand, the majority of moving type IV bursts are associated with fast

autoionization induced by re-excitation of droplets relaxing into levels below

autoionization and photoionization is He$_2^+$, whereas the delayed appearance
of He$^+$ is indicative of the ejection of excited He atoms from the droplets.
The state-resolved time-dependent photoelectron spectra reveal that
intermediate excited states of the droplets are populated in the course of the
relaxation, terminating in the lowest-lying metastable singlet and triplet He

resolution and the temporal resolution can be limited by the need for large
batch sizes to yield sufficient structure in the contrast image. In this work,
we propose spatiotemporal registration as a compelling technique for
event-based rotational motion estimation. We theoretcally justify the approach
and establish its fundamental and practical advantages over contrast
maximisation. In particular, spatiotemporal registration also produces feature
tracks as a by-product, which directly supports an efficient visual odometry
pipeline with graph-based optimisation for motion averaging. The simplicity of
our visual odometry pipeline allows it to process more than 1 M events/second.
We also contribute a new event dataset for visual odometry, where motion
sequences with large velocity variations were acquired using a high-precision
robot arm.

  Alternative to Improve Backbones","10 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, research efforts have been concentrated on revealing how
pre-trained model makes a difference in neural network performance.
Self-supervision and semi-supervised learning technologies have been
extensively explored by the community and are proven to be of great potential
in obtaining a powerful pre-trained model. However, these models require huge
training costs (i.e., hundreds of millions of images or training iterations).
In this paper, we propose to improve existing baseline networks via knowledge
distillation from off-the-shelf pre-trained big powerful models. Different from
existing knowledge distillation frameworks which require student model to be
consistent with both soft-label generated by teacher model and hard-label
annotated by humans, our solution performs distillation by only driving
prediction of the student model consistent with that of the teacher model.
Therefore, our distillation setting can get rid of manually labeled data and
can be trained with extra unlabeled data to fully exploit capability of teacher
model for better learning. We empirically find that such simple distillation
settings perform extremely effective, for example, the top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1k validation set of MobileNetV3-large and ResNet50-D can be
significantly improved from 75.2% to 79% and 79.1% to 83%, respectively. We
have also thoroughly analyzed what are dominant factors that affect the
distillation performance and how they make a difference. Extensive downstream
computer vision tasks, including transfer learning, object detection and
semantic segmentation, can significantly benefit from the distilled pretrained
models. All our experiments are implemented based on PaddlePaddle, codes and a
series of improved pretrained models with ssld suffix are available in
PaddleClas.

two complementary approaches. In order to account for substitutional disorder,
on the one hand we directly average the transverse magnetic susceptibility in
real space over different disorder configurations and on the other hand we use
the coherent potential approximation (CPA). While the method of direct
averaging is numerically exact, it is computationally expensive and limited by
the maximal size of the supercell which can be simulated on a computer. On the
contrary the CPA does not suffer from this drawback and yields a cheap
numerical scheme. Therefore, we additionally compare the results of these two
approaches and show that the CPA gives very good results for most of the
magnetic properties, including the magnon energies and the spatial shape of the
eigenmodes. However, it turns out that while reproducing the general trend, the
CPA systematically underestimates the disorder induced damping of the magnons.
This provides evidence that the physics of impurity scattering in this system
is governed by non-local effects missing in the CPA. Finally, we study the real
space eigenmodes of the system, including their spatial shapes, and analyze
their temperature dependence within the random phase approximation.

However, the high diversities in the learned features weaken the discrimination
of the relevant change indicators in unsupervised change detection tasks.
Moreover, these methods lack research on massive archived images. In this work,
a self-supervised change detection approach based on an unlabeled multi-view
setting is proposed to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by the use of
a multi-view contrastive loss and an implicit contrastive strategy in the
feature alignment between multi-view images. In this approach, a pseudo-Siamese
network is trained to regress the output between its two branches pre-trained
in a contrastive way on a large dataset of multi-temporal homogeneous or
heterogeneous image patches. Finally, the feature distance between the outputs
of the two branches is used to define a change measure, which can be analyzed
by thresholding to get the final binary change map. Experiments are carried out
on five homogeneous and heterogeneous remote sensing image datasets. The
proposed SSL approach is compared with other supervised and unsupervised
state-of-the-art change detection methods. Results demonstrate both
improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and that the proposed
SSL approach narrows the gap between unsupervised and supervised change
detection.

equilibrium ensembles in isolated and closed quantum systems. Recently, it was
predicted that in the thermodynamic ($N\rightarrow\infty$) limit of large
quantum many-body systems canonical density matrices emerge for small
subsystems from almost all pure states. This notion of canonical typicality is
assumed to originate from the entanglement between subsystem and environment
and the resulting intrinsic quantum complexity of the many-body state. For
individual eigenstates it has been shown that local observables show thermal
properties provided the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis holds, which
requires the system to be quantum chaotic. In the present paper, we study the
emergence of thermal states in the regime of a quantum analog of a mixed phase
space. Specifically, we study the emergence of the canonical density matrix of
an impurity upon reduction from isolated energy eigenstates of a large but
finite quantum system the impurity is embedded in. Our system can be tuned by
means of a single parameter from quantum integrability to quantum chaos and
corresponds in between to a system with mixed quantum phase space. We show that
the probability for finding a canonical density matrix when reducing the
ensemble of energy eigenstates of the finite many-body system can be
quantitatively controlled and tuned by the degree of quantum chaos present. For

almost all of the data available. In addition, a lot of information about the
dimensions of the simple and Weyl modules is included. More generally, one may
expect to include details about the socle structure of the projective modules,
Jordan block structure of the action of unipotent elements, decompositions of
symmetric and exterior powers of simple modules, and tensor products of
modules, traces of semisimple elements and so on. The ideal place for such

queried to produce the information required. This document, while imperfect,

  Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When approaching graph signal processing tasks, graphs are usually assumed to
be perfectly known. However, in many practical applications, the observed
(inferred) network is prone to perturbations which, if ignored, will hinder
performance. Tailored to those setups, this paper presents a robust formulation
for the problem of graph-filter identification from input-output observations.
Different from existing works, our approach consists in addressing the robust
identification by formulating a joint graph denoising and graph-filter
identification problem. Such a problem is formulated as a non-convex
optimization, suitable relaxations are proposed, and graph-stationarity
assumptions are incorporated to enhance performance. Finally, numerical
experiments with synthetic and real-world graphs are used to assess the
proposed schemes and compare them with existing (robust) alternatives.

  Distribution Distance",,"IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
  (CVPR), 2021",,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent years, Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) has become an
indispensable part of the face recognition system to guarantee the stability
and reliability of recognition performance in an unconstrained scenario. For
this purpose, the FIQA method should consider both the intrinsic property and
the recognizability of the face image. Most previous works aim to estimate the
sample-wise embedding uncertainty or pair-wise similarity as the quality score,
which only considers the information from partial intra-class. However, these
methods ignore the valuable information from the inter-class, which is for
estimating to the recognizability of face image. In this work, we argue that a
high-quality face image should be similar to its intra-class samples and
dissimilar to its inter-class samples. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised
FIQA method that incorporates Similarity Distribution Distance for Face Image
Quality Assessment (SDD-FIQA). Our method generates quality pseudo-labels by
calculating the Wasserstein Distance (WD) between the intra-class similarity
distributions and inter-class similarity distributions. With these quality
pseudo-labels, we are capable of training a regression network for quality
prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed SDD-FIQA surpasses the state-of-the-arts by an impressive margin.
Meanwhile, our method shows good generalization across different recognition
systems.

geoeffectiveness of MCs depends on their properties which evolve during their
interplanetary passage. Based on an analysis of observations spanning two solar
cycles we establish that MCs interacting with the ambient solar wind magnetic
field (i.e., heliospheric open flux) lose a substantial amount of their initial
magnetic flux via magnetic reconnection, which in some cases, reduce their
geoeffectiveness. We find a linear correlation between the eroded flux of MCs
and solar open flux which is consistent with the scenario that MC erosion is
mediated via the local heliospheric magnetic field draping around an MC during
its interplanetary propagation. The solar open flux is governed by the sunspot
cycle. This work therefore uncovers a hitherto unknown pathway for solar cycle
modulation of the properties of MCs.

the slope calculated at lower densities is linked to the tails of neutron

Benefiting from the superiority of QAM and QANet, we achieve the best

tasks with good quality estimation, e.g. instance segmentation. Specifically,
QAM improves Mask R-CNN by ~1% mAP on COCO and LVISv1.0 datasets. Based on the

healthy pests present in the crop field. Impacts of awareness is modeled via a
saturated term. It is further assumed that self-aware people will adopt
biological control methods, namely integrated pest management. Susceptible
pests are detrimental to crops and, moreover, there may be some time delay in
measuring the healthy pests in the crop field. A time delay may also take place
while becoming aware of the control strategies or taking necessary steps to
control the pest attack. In agreement, we develop our model incorporating two
time delays into the system. The existence and the stability criteria of the
equilibria are obtained in terms of the basic reproduction number and time
delays. Stability switches occur through Hopf-bifurcation when time delays
cross critical values. Optimal control theory has been applied for the
cost-effectiveness of the delayed system. Numerical simulations illustrate the
obtained analytical results.

transient (FBOT), AT\,2018cow, with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope (uGMRT). Our observations span $t =$ 11 $-$ 570 days post-explosion
and a frequency range of 250 $-$ 1450 MHz. The uGMRT light curves are best
modeled as synchrotron emission from an inhomogeneous radio-emitting region
expanding into an ionized medium. However, due to the lack of information on
the source covering factor, which is a measure of the degree of inhomogeneity,
we derive various parameters assuming the source covering factor to be unity.
These parameters, hence, indicate limits on the actual values in an
inhomogeneous model. We derive the lower limit of the shock radius to be $R
\sim$ (6.1$-$14.4) $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm at $t =$ 138$-$257 days
post-explosion. We find that the fast-moving ejecta from the explosion are
moving with velocity $v$ $>$ 0.2c up to $t =$ 257 days post-explosion. The
upper limits of the mass-loss rate of the progenitor are $\dot{M}$ $\sim$
(4.1$-$1.7) $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$ at (19.3$-$45.7) years
before the explosion for a wind velocity $v_{\rm w}$ = 1000 km\,s$^{-1}$. These
$\dot{M}$ values are $\sim$ 100 times smaller than the previously reported
mass-loss rate at 2.2 years before the explosion, indicating an enhanced phase
of the mass-loss event close to the end-of-life of the progenitor. Our results
are in line with the speculation of the presence of a dense circumstellar shell
in the vicinity of AT\,2018cow from previous radio, ultra-violet, and optical

control laws for multi-agent systems under both single- and double-integrator

measurements when the agents are described by double-integrator dynamics),
which guarantee uniform exponential stabilization of the desired formation in
terms of shape and scale. A key contribution of this work is to show that the
classical bearing rigidity condition on the graph topology, required for
achieving the stabilization of a formation up to a scaling factor, is relaxed
and extended in a natural manner by exploring PE conditions imposed either on a

difficulties occur when the problem is defined in a highly heterogeneous

cognitive devices, which have to make decisions autonomously using their
on-board computation and storage capacity based on information sensed from
their environment. Such devices are moving and cannot rely on fixed
infrastructure elements, but instead realise on-the-fly networking and thus
frequently join and leave temporal swarms. All this creates novel demands for
the underlying architecture and resource management, which must bridge the gap
from edge to cloud environments, while keeping the QoS parameters within
required boundaries. The paper presents an initial architecture and a resource
management framework for the implementation of this type of IT service
provisioning.

the needs of medical infrastructures in the Pavia Province and to suggest
different scenarios about the vaccination campaign which possibly help in
reducing the fatalities and/or reducing the number of infected in the
population. The proposed research combines a new mathematical description of
the spread of an infectious diseases which takes into account both age and
average daily social contacts with a detailed analysis of the dataset of all
traced infected individuals in the Province of Pavia. These information are
used to develop a data-driven model in which calibration and feeding of the
model are extensively used. The epidemiological evolution is obtained by
relying on an approach based on statistical mechanics. This leads to study the
evolution over time of a system of probability distributions characterizing the
age and social contacts of the population. One of the main outcomes shows that,
as expected, the spread of the disease is closely related to the mean number of
contacts of individuals. The model permits to forecast thanks to an uncertainty
quantification approach and in the short time horizon, the average number and
the confidence bands of expected hospitalized classified by age and to test
different options for an effective vaccination campaign with age-decreasing

model-free single-object tracking (SOT), which takes the object state in the
first frame as input, and jointly solves state estimation and tracking in
subsequent frames. The main purpose for this new setting is to break the strong
limitation of the popular ""detection and tracking"" scheme in multi-object
tracking. Moreover, we notice that shape completion by overlaying the point
clouds, which is a by-product of our proposed task, not only improves the
performance of state estimation but also has numerous applications. As no
benchmark for this task is available so far, we construct a new dataset
LiDAR-SOT and corresponding evaluation protocols based on the Waymo Open

involving point cloud registration, vehicle shapes, correspondence, and motion
priors. Our quantitative and qualitative results prove the effectiveness of our
SOTracker and reveal the challenging cases for SOT in point clouds, including
the sparsity of LiDAR data, abrupt motion variation, etc. Finally, we also
explore how the proposed task and algorithm may benefit other autonomous
driving applications, including simulating LiDAR scans, generating motion data,

present a novel clustering algorithm called Deep Superpixel Cut (DSC), which
measures the deep similarity between superpixels and formulates image

contain a source image plus some text that describes certain modifications to
this image and the desired image. Prior work usually uses a three-stage
strategy to tackle this task: 1) extract the features of the inputs; 2) fuse
the feature of the source image and its modified text to obtain fusion feature;
3) learn a similarity metric between the desired image and the source image +
modified text by using deep metric learning. Since classical image/text
encoders can learn the useful representation and common pair-based loss
functions of distance metric learning are enough for cross-modal retrieval,
people usually improve retrieval accuracy by designing new fusion networks.
However, these methods do not successfully handle the modality gap caused by
the inconsistent distribution and representation of the features of different
modalities, which greatly influences the feature fusion and similarity
learning. To alleviate this problem, we adopt the contrastive self-supervised
learning method Deep InforMax (DIM) to our approach to bridge this gap by
enhancing the dependence between the text, the image, and their fusion.
Specifically, our method narrows the modality gap between the text modality and
the image modality by maximizing mutual information between their not exactly
semantically identical representation. Moreover, we seek an effective common
subspace for the semantically same fusion feature and desired image's feature
by utilizing Deep InforMax between the low-level layer of the image encoder and
the high-level layer of the fusion network. Extensive experiments on three
large-scale benchmark datasets show that we have bridged the modality gap

an event-triggered asynchronous scheme is investigated in order to reduce
communication while preserving estimation convergence. A distributed estimation
algorithm with a single step size is first proposed based on an event-triggered
communication scheme with a time-dependent decaying threshold. With the
event-triggered scheme, each sensor sends its estimate to neighbor sensors only
when the difference between the current estimate and the last sent-out estimate
is larger than the triggering threshold. We prove that the proposed algorithm

condition is satisfied if the topology is a balanced digraph containing a

estimates for the convergence rates, which are related to the step size as well

communication intensity in the event-triggered distributed algorithms, the
communication rate is proved to decay to zero with a certain speed almost
surely as time goes to infinity. We show that given the step size, adjusting
the decay speed of the triggering threshold can lead to a tradeoff between the
convergence rate of the estimation error and the decay speed of the
communication rate. Specifically, increasing the decay speed of the threshold
would make the communication rate decay faster, but reduce the convergence rate

analyzer for a dialect of Python language, PyX, called Pifthon using the said

overhead that ameliorates usability, covers a wide range of PyX programs that
include termination-and progress-sensitive channels, in contrast to other

formalization of the problem as it is studied in many applications. Given a
polygonal curve $P$ with $n$ vertices in fixed dimension, integers $k$, $\ell

of complexity at most $\ell$ such that every point on $P$ is covered by a
subtrajectory that has small Fr\'echet distance to one of the $k$ center curves
($\leq \Delta$). In many application scenarios, one is interested in finding
clusters of small complexity, which is controlled by the parameter $\ell$. Our
main result is a bicriterial approximation algorithm: if there exists a
solution for given parameters $k$, $\ell$, and $\Delta$, then our algorithm
finds a set of $k'$ center curves of complexity at most $\ell$ with covering
radius $\Delta'$ with $k' \in O( k \ell^2 \log (k \ell))$, and $\Delta'\leq 19
\Delta$. Moreover, within these approximation bounds, we can minimize $k$ while
keeping the other parameters fixed. If $\ell$ is a constant independent of $n$,
then, the approximation factor for the number of clusters $k$ is $O(\log k)$
and the approximation factor for the radius $\Delta$ is constant. In this case,
the algorithm has expected running time in $ \tilde{O}\left( k m^2 + mn\right)$

associated with abrupt changes in gas composition and dust physical properties.
Volatiles may affect dust growth, as they cover grains with icy mantles that
can change the fragmentation velocity of the grains. In turn, dust coagulation,
fragmentation, and drift through the gas disk can contribute to the
redistribution of volatiles between the ice and gas phases. Here we present the
hydrodynamic model FEOSAD for protoplanetary disks with two dust populations
and volatile dynamics. We compute the spatial distributions of major volatile
molecules (H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and CO) in the gas, on small and grown dust,
and analyze the composition of icy mantles over the initial 0.5 Myr of disk
evolution. We show that most of ice arrives to the grown dust through
coagulation with small grains. Spiral structures and dust rings forming in the
disk, as well as photodissociation in the outer regions, lead to the formation
of complex snowline shapes and multiple snowlines for each volatile species.
During the considered disk evolution, the snowlines shift closer to the star,
with their final position being a factor $4-5$ smaller than that at the disk
formation epoch. We demonstrate that volatiles tend to collect in the vicinity
of their snowlines, both in the ice and gas phases, leading to the formation of
thick icy mantles potentially important for dust dynamics. The dust size is
affected by a lower fragmentation velocity of bare grains in the model with a
higher turbulent viscosity.

magnetar SGR J1935+2154 on 2020 April 28 added credence to this hypothesis. We
report on simultaneous and non-simultaneous observing campaigns using the
Arecibo, Effelsberg, LOFAR, MeerKAT, MK2 and Northern Cross radio telescopes
and the MeerLICHT optical telescope in the days and months after the April 28
event. We did not detect any significant single radio pulses down to fluence
limits between 25 mJy ms and 18 Jy ms. Some observing epochs overlapped with
times when X-ray bursts were detected. Radio images made on four days using the
MeerKAT telescope revealed no point-like persistent or transient emission at
the location of the magnetar. No transient or persistent optical emission was
detected over seven days. Using the multi-colour MeerLICHT images combined with
relations between DM, NH and reddening we constrain the distance to SGR
J1935+2154, to be between 1.5 and 6.5 kpc. The upper limit is consistent with
some other distance indicators and suggests that the April 28 burst is closer
to two orders of magnitude less energetic than the least energetic FRBs. The
lack of single-pulse radio detections shows that the single pulses detected
over a range of fluences are either rare, or highly clustered, or both. It may
also indicate that the magnetar lies somewhere between being radio-quiet and
radio-loud in terms of its ability to produce radio emission efficiently.

information contained within the Cherenkov shower image, bypassing the need to
Hillas parameterise the image and allowing fast processing of the data.
  Existing work in this field has utilised images of the integrated charge from
IACT camera photomultipliers, however the majority of current and upcoming
generation IACT cameras have the capacity to read out the entire photosensor
waveform following a trigger. As the arrival times of Cherenkov photons from
Extensive Air Showers (EAS) at the camera plane are dependent upon the altitude
of their emission and the impact distance from the telescope, these waveforms
contain information potentially useful for IACT event classification.
  In this test-of-concept simulation study, we investigate the potential for
using these camera pixel waveforms with new deep learning techniques as a
background rejection method, against both proton and electron induced EAS. We
find that a means of utilising their information is to create a set of seven
additional 2-dimensional pixel maps of waveform parameters, to be fed into the
machine learning algorithm along with the integrated charge image. Whilst we
ultimately find that the only classification power against electrons is based
upon event direction, methods based upon timing information appear to
out-perform similar charge based methods for gamma/hadron separation. We also
review existing methods of event classifications using a combination of deep

deployed in a large-scale cellular network with spatially random distributed
devices. Both the schemes of digital and analog transmission are considered,
providing support of error-free uploading and over-the-air aggregation of local
model updates by devices. The derived spatial convergence rate for digital
transmission is found to be constrained by a limited number of active devices
regardless of device density and converges to the ground-true rate
exponentially fast as the number grows. The population of active devices
depends on network parameters such as processing gain and
signal-to-interference threshold for decoding. On the other hand, the limit
does not exist for uncoded analog transmission. In this case, the spatial
convergence rate is slowed down due to the direct exposure of signals to the
perturbation of inter-cell interference. Nevertheless, the effect diminishes
when devices are dense as interference is averaged out by aggressive
over-the-air aggregation. In terms of learning latency (in second), analog
transmission is preferred to the digital scheme as the former dramatically
reduces multi-access latency by enabling simultaneous access.

A state is called completely passive if work cannot be extracted from any
number of copies of the state by any unitary operations. It has been
established that a quantum state is completely passive if and only if it is a
Gibbs ensemble. In physically plausible setups, however, the class of possible
operations is often restricted by fundamental constraints such as symmetries
imposed on the system. In the present work, we investigate the concept of
complete passivity under symmetry constraints. Specifically, we prove that a
quantum state is completely passive under a symmetry constraint described by a
connected compact Lie group, if and only if it is a generalized Gibbs ensemble
(GGE) including conserved charges associated with the symmetry. Remarkably, our
result applies to non-commutative symmetry such as $SU(2)$ symmetry, suggesting
an unconventional extension of the notion of GGE. Furthermore, we consider the
setup where a quantum work storage is explicitly included, and prove that the
characterization of complete passivity remains unchanged. Our result extends
the notion of thermal equilibrium to systems protected by symmetries, and would
lead to flexible design principles of quantum heat engines and batteries.
Moreover, our approach serves as a foundation of the resource theory of
thermodynamics in the presence of symmetries.

populations is crucial for observational studies of star-forming complexes.
This task is particularly problematic in a Cygnus-X subregion where several
components, located at different distances, are overlapped: the Berkeley 87
young massive cluster, the poorly-known [DB2001] Cl05 embedded cluster, and the
ON2 star-forming complex, in turn composed of several HII regions. We aim at
providing a methodology for building an exhaustive census of young objects that
can consistently deal with large differences in both extinction and distance.
  OMEGA2000 near-infrared observations of the Berkeley 87 / ON2 field are
merged with archival data from Gaia, Chandra, Spitzer, and Herschel, as well as
cross-identifications from the literature. To address the incompleteness
effects and selection biases that arise from the line-of-sight overlap, we
adapt existing methods for extinction estimation and young object
classification, and we define the intrinsic reddening index, $R_\mathrm{int}$,
a new tool to separate intrinsically red sources from those whose infrared
color excess is caused by extinction. We also introduce a new method to find
young stellar objects based on $R_\mathrm{int}$. The flexibility of our
approach allows to overcome photometric biases in order to obtain homogeneous
catalogs of young sources.
  As a result, we find 571 objects whose classification is related to recent or
ongoing star formation. Together with other point sources with individual
estimates of distance or extinction, we compile a catalog of 3005 objects to be
used for further membership work. A new distance for Berkeley 87, ($1673 \pm
17$) pc, is estimated as a median of 13 spectroscopic members with accurate
Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. Our multi-wavelength census will serve as a basis for
disentangling the overlapped populations.

shows that there is high variability in the detectability of social media user
protest supporters and that the collective posting rhythm and the day of
observation are significant explanatory factors. The implication is that
studies of collective spatial behavior would benefit by focussing on users'
activity centres and their urban environment, rather than their physical

architectures often exhibit significant limitations, including sensitivity to
oversmoothing, long-range dependencies, and spurious edges, e.g., as can occur
as a result of graph heterophily or adversarial attacks. To at least partially
address these issues within a simple transparent framework, we consider a new
family of GNN layers designed to mimic and integrate the update rules of two
classical iterative algorithms, namely, proximal gradient descent and iterative
reweighted least squares (IRLS). The former defines an extensible base GNN
architecture that is immune to oversmoothing while nonetheless capturing
long-range dependencies by allowing arbitrary propagation steps. In contrast,
the latter produces a novel attention mechanism that is explicitly anchored to
an underlying end-to-end energy function, contributing stability with respect
to edge uncertainty. When combined we obtain an extremely simple yet robust
model that we evaluate across disparate scenarios including standardized
benchmarks, adversarially-perturbated graphs, graphs with heterophily, and
graphs involving long-range dependencies. In doing so, we compare against SOTA
GNN approaches that have been explicitly designed for the respective task,
achieving competitive or superior node classification accuracy. Our code is

concepts, applicable to all fields of chemistry. In open shell transition
elements chemistry and physics, 3d4, 3d9, and 3d7(low-spin) configurations in
octahedral complexes serve as particular illustrative and firm examples, where
a striking change (distortion) in local geometry is associated to a substantial
reduction of electronic energy. However, there has been a lasting debate, about
the fact that the octahedra are found to exclusively elongate, (at least for eg
electrons). Against this background, the title compound displays two marked
features, (1) the octahedron of oxygen atoms around Os6+ (d2) is drastically
compressed, in contrast to the standard JT expectations, and (2) the splitting
of the t2g set induced by this compression is extreme, such that a diamagnetic
ground state results. What we see is obviously a Jahn-Teller distortion
resulting in a compression of the respective octahedron and acting on the t2g
set of orbitals. Both these issues are unprecedented. Noteworthy, the splitting
into a lower dxy (hosting two d electrons with opposite spin) and two higher
dxz and dyz orbitals is so large that for the first time ever the Hund's
coupling for t2g electrons is overcome. We show that these effects are not
forced by structural frustration, the structure offers sufficient space for Os
to shift the apical oxygen atoms to a standard distance. Local electronic
effects appear to be responsible, instead. The relevance of these findings is
far reaching, since they provide insights in the hierarchy of perturbations
defining ground states of open shell electronic systems. The system studied
here, offers substantially more structural and compositional degrees of
freedom, such that a configuration could form that enables Os6+ to adopt its
apparently genuine diamagnetic ground state.

successfully employed to investigate the problems pertaining to the grid of

and explore anomalous elasticity. Allowing for the local strain to couple {\em
asymmetrically} with the states of the order parameter, we uncover the dramatic
effects of these couplings on the fluctuations of the local displacements near
$T_c$, and also on the nature of the phase transition itself. Near second order
phase transitions and with weak asymmetry in the order parameter - strain
couplings, the variance of the displacement fluctuations in two dimensions
scale with the system size $L$ in a universal fashion as $[\ln (L/a_0)]^{2/3}$;
$a_0$ is a small-scale cutoff. Likewise, the correlation functions of the
difference of the local displacements at two different points separated by $r$
scale as $[\ln (r/a_0)]^{2/3}$ for large $r$. For stronger asymmetry, this
variance diverges as $L$ exceeds beyond a (nonuniversal) size, determined by
the model parameters, signaling a transition to a phase with only short range
order or the loss of the positional order of the elastic medium. At dimensions
higher than two, for sufficiently weak selectivity, the variance of the
displacement fluctuations is $L$-independent corresponding to long range order.
However, if the selectivity parameters rise beyond a dimension-dependent
threshold values, again the positional order is lost with a concomitant
transition to a phase with short range order. Large values of the order
parameter - strain couplings can turn the phase transition into a first order
as well.

assumed to be stratified into different layers, each of which consists of a
pure body-centered cubic ionic crystal in a charge compensating background of
highly degenerate electrons. The validity of this assumption is examined by
analyzing the stability of multinary ionic compounds in dense stellar matter.
It is thus shown that their stability against phase separation is uniquely
determined by their structure and their composition irrespective of the stellar
conditions. However, equilibrium with respect to weak and strong nuclear
processes imposes very stringent constraints on the composition of multinary
compounds, and thereby on their formation. By examining different cubic and
noncubic lattices, it is found that substitutional compounds having the same
structure as cesium chloride are the most likely to exist in the outer crust of
a nonaccreting neutron star. The presence of ternary compounds is also
investigated. Very accurate analytical expressions are obtained for the
threshold pressure, as well as for the densities of the different phases
irrespective of the degree of relativity of the electron gas. Finally,
numerical calculations of the ground-state structure and of the equation of
state of the outer crust of a cold nonaccreting neutron star are carried out

firstly the new asymptotic normality is derived in a simultaneous limiting

magnitudes; second, the result is valid for general error distribution (not

statistic based on the sum of the fourth powers of cross-section correlations
from OLS residuals, instead of their squares used in the Lagrange multiplier
statistic. This new test is generally more powerful, and the improvement is
particularly visible against alternatives with weak or sparse cross-section

ice near the geographic South Pole with radio antennas, in order to observe the
highest energy (E>1 EeV) neutrinos in the Universe. To this end, ICG2 will use
the impulsive radio-frequency (RF) signal produced by neutrino interactions in
polar ice caps. In such experiments, rare single event candidates must be
unambiguously separated from background; to date, signal identification
strategies primarily reject thermal noise and anthropogenic backgrounds. Here,
we consider the possibility that fake neutrino signals may also be naturally
generated via the 'triboelectric effect'. This broadly includes any process in
which force applied at a boundary layer results in displacement of surface
charge, generating a potential difference {\Delta}V. Wind blowing over granular
surfaces such as snow can induce such a {\Delta}V, with subsequent discharge.
Discharges over nanosecond-timescales can then lead to RF emissions at
characteristic MHz-GHz frequencies. We find that such backgrounds are evident
in the several neutrino experiments considered, and are generally characterized
by: a) a threshold wind velocity which likely depends on the experimental
signal trigger threshold and layout; for the experiments considered herein,
this value is typically O(10 m/s), b) frequency spectra generally shifted to
the low-end of the frequency regime to which current radio experiments are
typically sensitive (100-200 MHz), c) for the strongest background signals, an
apparent preference for discharges from above-surface structures, although the
presence of more isotropic, lower amplitude triboelectric discharges cannot be
excluded.

sonic-boom propagation. Splitting methods allow one to divide complicated
partial differential equations into simpler parts that are solved by
specifically tailored numerical schemes. The present work proposes a second
order exponential integrator for the numerical solution of sonic-boom
propagation modelled through a dispersive equation with Burgers' nonlinearity.
The linear terms are efficiently solved in frequency space through FFT, while
the nonlinear terms are efficiently solved by a WENO scheme. The numerical
method is designed to be highly parallelisable and therefore takes full
advantage of modern computer hardware. The new approach also improves the
accuracy compared to the splitting method and it reduces oscillations. The
enclosed numerical results illustrate that parallelisation on a CPU results in
a speedup of 22 times faster than the straightforward sequential version. The
GPU implementation further accelerates the runtime by a factor 3, which
improves to 5 when single precision is used instead of double precision.

proposed chiral structured-illumination microscopy (SIM) method to image chiral
fluorescent domains at sub-wavelength resolution. Chiral SIM is suitable for
imaging chiral domains at sub-wavelength resolution but loses the high spatial
frequency of the achiral ones. In order to obtain the full picture of all
fluorescent domains at sub-wavelength resolution, we propose an advanced
version of chiral SIM, termed double SIM, which enables simultaneous imaging of
achiral and chiral domains at sub-wavelength resolution. In double SIM, the
illumination field must be spatially structured both in the intensity and
optical chirality so that moir\'e effects can be concurrently generated on the
achiral and chiral fluorescent domains of a sample. This allows down-modulating
the high spatial frequency of both domains at the same time and thus provides
sub-wavelength details after image reconstruction. To generate the illumination
field with concurrently structured intensity and optical chirality, we propose
interfering two coherent circularly polarized light with the same handedness at
the sample plane. We introduce the working principle of double SIM and
theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of this method using different kinds

to explore and analyze complex or large data. In these representations, data
are encoded with various visual attributes depending on the needs of the
representation itself. To make coherent design choices about visual attributes,
the visual search field proposes guidelines based on the human brain perception
of features. However, information visualization representations frequently need
to depict more data than the amount these guidelines have been validated on.
Since, the information visualization community has extended these guidelines to
a wider parameter space.
  This paper contributes to this theme by extending visual search theories to
an information visualization context. We consider a visual search task where
subjects are asked to find an unknown outlier in a grid of randomly laid out
distractor. Stimuli are defined by color and shape features for the purpose of
visually encoding categorical data. The experimental protocol is made of a
parameters space reduction step (i.e., sub-sampling) based on a machine
learning model, and a user evaluation to measure capacity limits and validate
hypotheses. The results show that the major difficulty factor is the number of
visual attributes that are used to encode the outlier. When redundantly
encoded, the display heterogeneity has no effect on the task. When encoded with
one attribute, the difficulty depends on that attribute heterogeneity until its
capacity limit (7 for color, 5 for shape) is reached. Finally, when encoded
with two attributes simultaneously, performances drop drastically even with
minor heterogeneity.

deformation in vicinity of 42Si. This requests systematic theoretical studies
to clarify more specific aspects of nuclear deformation and its causes.
Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the nature and cause of
the nuclear deformations and its relation to the loss of the neutron magic
number N = 28 in vicinity of 42Si. Method: The framework of antisymmetrized
molecular dynamics with Gogny D1S density functional has been applied. The
model assumes no spatial symmetry and can describe triaxial deformation. It
also incorporates with the configuration mixing by the generator coordinate
method. Results: We show that the shell effects and the loss of the magicity
induce various nuclear deformations. In particular, the N = 26 and N = 30
isotones have triaxially deformed ground states. We also note that the erosion
of the N = 28 magicity gradually occurs and has no definite boundaries.
Conclusion: The present calculation predicts various nuclear deformations in
vicinity of 42Si and suggests that the inter-band electric transitions are good
measure for it. We also remark that the magicity is lost without the
single-particle level inversion in the oblate deformed nuclei such as 42Si.

24-Java-API controlled experiment. Our replication applies to Python and
involves 129 new developers and 22 new APIs. We find that using APIs with
blindspots statistically significantly reduces the developers' ability to
correctly reason about the APIs in both languages, but that the effect is more
pronounced for Python. Interestingly, for Java, the effect increased with
complexity of the code relying on the API, whereas for Python, the opposite was
true. Whether the developers considered API uses to be more difficult, less
clear, and less familiar did not have an effect on their ability to correctly
reason about them. Developers with better long-term memory recall were more
likely to correctly reason about APIs with blindspots, but short-term memory,
processing speed, episodic memory, and memory span had no effect. Surprisingly,
professional experience and expertice did not improve the developers' ability
to reason about APIs with blindspots across both languages, with long-term
professionals with many years of experience making mistakes as often as
relative novices. Finally, personality traits did not significantly affect the
Python developers' ability to reason about APIs with blindspots, but less
extraverted and more open developers were better at reasoning about Java APIs
with blindspots. Overall, our findings suggest that blindspots in APIs are a
serious problem across languages, and that experience and education alone do
not overcome that problem, suggesting that tools are needed to help developers
recognize blindspots in APIs as they write code that uses those APIs.

surrounding your choices. In particular, a graph is said to be

is called the upper paint cost, denoted $\rho^u(G)$, and occurs when $d={\rm

gravitational-wave signals due to spin and tidal effects. In fact, spins can
have a significant impact on the tidal excitation of the quasi-normal modes of
a neutron star, which is not included in current state-of-the-art waveform
models. We develop a simple approximate description that accounts for the
Coriolis effect of spin on the tidal excitation of the neutron star's
quadrupolar and octupolar fundamental quasi-normal modes and incorporate it in
the SEOBNRv4T waveform model. We show that the Coriolis effect introduces only
one new interaction term in an effective action in the co-rotating frame of the
star, and fix the coefficient by considering the spin-induced shift in the
resonance frequencies that has been computed numerically for the mode
frequencies of rotating neutron stars in the literature. We investigate the
impact of relativistic corrections due to the gravitational redshift and
frame-dragging effects, and identify important directions where more detailed
theoretical developments are needed in the future. Comparisons of our new model
to numerical relativity simulations of double neutron star and neutron
star-black hole binaries show improved consistency in the agreement compared to
current models used in data analysis

demonstrate that silicon vacancy centres in semiconductor silicon carbide (SiC)
provide a remarkably small natural distribution of their optical
absorption/emission lines despite an elevated defect concentration of $\approx
0.43\,\rm \mu m^{-3}$. In particular, without any external tuning mechanism, we
show that only 13 defects have to be investigated until at least two optical

match better if they have higher similarity in that common space. Matching
function learning tries to directly learn the complex matching function that

learning resorts to applying a dot product which has limited expressiveness on
the latent features of users and items, while the matching function learning
has weakness in capturing low-rank relations. To overcome such flaws, we
propose a novel recommendation model named Balanced Collaborative Filtering

urban traffics. However, most of the existing traffic prediction models do not
consider the computational burden and memory space when they capture

factorized Spatial-Temporal Tensor Graph Convolutional Network to deal with
traffic speed prediction. Traffic networks are modeled and unified into a graph
that integrates spatial and temporal information simultaneously. We further
extend graph convolution into tensor space and propose a tensor graph
convolution network to extract more discriminating features from
spatial-temporal graph data. To reduce the computational burden, we take Tucker
tensor decomposition and derive factorized a tensor convolution, which performs
separate filtering in small-scale space, time, and feature modes. Besides, we
can benefit from noise suppression of traffic data when discarding those
trivial components in the process of tensor decomposition. Extensive
experiments on two real-world traffic speed datasets demonstrate our method is
more effective than those traditional traffic prediction methods, and meantime
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) for global planning and Model Predictive
Control (MPC) for local planning. The approach targets a three-wheeled cycle
rickshaw (trishaw) used for autonomous urban transportation in shared spaces.
Due to the nature of the vehicle, the algorithms had to be adapted in order to
adhere to non-holonomic kinematic constraints using the Kinematic Single-Track
Model.
  The vehicle is designed to offer transportation for people and goods in
shared environments such as roads, sidewalks, bicycle lanes but also open
spaces that are often occupied by other traffic participants. Therefore, the
algorithm presented in this paper needs to anticipate and avoid dynamic
obstacles, such as pedestrians or bicycles, but also be fast enough in order to
work in real-time so that it can adapt to changes in the environment. Our
approach uses an RRT variant for global planning that has been modified for
single-track kinematics and improved by exploiting dead-end nodes. This allows
us to compute global paths in unstructured environments very fast. In a second
step, our MPC-based local planner makes use of the global path to compute the
vehicle's trajectory while incorporating dynamic obstacles such as pedestrians
and other road users.
  Our approach has shown to work both in simulation as well as first real-life
tests and can be easily extended for more sophisticated behaviors.

experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk
epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling the COVID-19 in
highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate,
and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. The
results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the
disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each
region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections,
disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a
geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our
data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission
dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.

appear in mathematical phylogenetics and can be approximated with the help of
similarity measures between gene sequences, albeit not without errors. The
corresponding graph editing problem can be used as a means of error correction.
Since the arc set modification problems for BMGs are NP-complete, efficient
heuristics are needed if BMGs are to be used for the practical analysis of
biological sequence data. Since BMGs have a characterization in terms of
consistency of a certain set of rooted triples, we consider heuristics that
operate on triple sets. As an alternative, we show that there is a close
connection to a set partitioning problem that leads to a class of top-down
recursive algorithms that are similar to Aho's supertree algorithm and give
rise to BMG editing algorithms that are consistent in the sense that they leave
BMGs invariant. Extensive benchmarking shows that community detection
algorithms for the partitioning steps perform best for BMG editing.

  Detection Based on Lane-Keeping Performance",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the enrichment of smartphones, driving distractions caused by phone
usages have become a threat to driving safety. A promising way to mitigate
driving distractions is to detect them and give real-time safety warnings.
However, existing detection algorithms face two major challenges, low user
acceptance caused by in-vehicle camera sensors, and uncertain accuracy of
pre-trained models due to drivers individual differences. Therefore, this study
proposes a domain-specific automated machine learning (AutoML) to self-learn
the optimal models to detect distraction based on lane-keeping performance
data. The AutoML integrates the key modeling steps into an auto-optimizable
pipeline, including knowledge-based feature extraction, feature selection by
recursive feature elimination (RFE), algorithm selection, and hyperparameter
auto-tuning by Bayesian optimization. An AutoML method based on XGBoost, termed
AutoGBM, is built as the classifier for prediction and feature ranking. The
model is tested based on driving simulator experiments of three driving
distractions caused by phone usage: browsing short messages, browsing long
messages, and answering a phone call. The proposed AutoGBM method is found to
be reliable and promising to predict phone-related driving distractions, which
achieves satisfactory results prediction, with a predictive power of 80\% on
group level and 90\% on individual level accuracy. Moreover, the results also
evoke the fact that each distraction types and drivers require different
optimized hyperparameters values, which reconfirm the necessity of utilizing
AutoML to detect driving distractions. The purposed AutoGBM not only produces
better performance with fewer features; but also provides data-driven insights
about system design.

prediction power. We focus on relationships between the trained accuracy of an
architecture and its accuracy prior to training, by considering statistics over
multiple initialisations. We observe that minimising the coefficient of
variation of the untrained accuracy, $CV_{U}$, consistently leads to better
performing architectures. We test the $CV_{U}$ as a neural architecture search
scoring metric using the NAS-Bench-201 database of trained neural

an accuracy of $91.90 \pm 2.27$, $64.08 \pm 5.63$ and $38.76 \pm 6.62$ for
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and a downscaled version of ImageNet, respectively. Since
these values are statistically above the random baseline, we make a conclusion
that a good architecture should be stable against weights initialisations. It

older adults are represented proportionally to the population at large in AI

older adults are very under-represented; five data sets in the study that
explicitly documented the closed age intervals of their subjects included older
adults (defined as older than 65 years), while only one included oldest-old
adults (defined as older than 85 years). Additionally, we find that only 24 of
the data sets include any age-related information in their documentation or

sets to collect and record the subjects' ages. We recognize the unique
difficulties in creating representative data sets in terms of age, but raise it

This problem has roots in conservative nature of TCP, especially in its
Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) phase. In other words, since
TCP can't figure out precisely the congestion status of the network, it follows
a conservative strategy to keep the network from overwhelming. We believe that
precisely congestion estimation in the network can solve this problem by
avoiding unnecessary conservation. To this end, this paper proposes an
algorithm which considers packet loss and delay information jointly and employs
a probabilistic approach to accurately estimation of congestion status in the
network. To examine the proposed scheme performance, extensive simulations have
been performed in the NS-2 environment. Simulation results reveal that the
proposed algorithm has better performance than existing algorithms in terms of
