for this system demonstrate that such systems are critical for coordination

between systems with different values of $n$, using two realizations, one
isotropic under local $SU(2)$ transformations and one anisotropic. Exact

described as a combination of motions along a handfull of low-frequency modes,
that is, with the values of a few normal coordinates. This means that, when the
functional motion of a protein is unknown, it should prove possible to predict
it, since it amounts to guess a few values. However, without the help of
additional experimental data, using normal coordinates for generating accurate
conformers far away from the initial one is not so straightforward. To do so, a
new approach is proposed: instead of building conformers directly with the
values of a subset of normal coordinates, they are built in two steps, the
conformer built with normal coordinates being just used for defining a set of
distance constraints, the final conformer being built so as to match them. Note
that this approach amounts to transform the problem of generating accurate
protein conformers using normal coordinates into a better known one: the
distance-geometry problem, which is herein solved with the help of the ROSETTA
software. In the present study, this approach allowed to rebuild accurately six
large amplitude conformational changes, using at most six low-frequency normal
coordinates. As a consequence of the low-dimensionality of the corresponding
subspace, random exploration also proved enough for generating low-energy
conformers close to the known end-point of the conformational change of the LAO
binding protein, lysozyme T4 and adenylate kinase.

approached as a purely associational concept. In this paper, we propose a
principled causality-based approach for explaining black-box decision-making

our framework lies probabilistic contrastive counterfactuals, a concept that
can be traced back to philosophical, cognitive, and social foundations of
theories on how humans generate and select explanations. We show how such
counterfactuals can quantify the direct and indirect influences of a variable

individuals negatively affected by the algorithm's decision. Unlike prior work,
our system, LEWIS: (1)can compute provably effective explanations and recourse

varying levels of background knowledge of the underlying causal model and
(3)makes no assumptions about the internals of an algorithmic system except for
the availability of its input-output data. We empirically evaluate LEWIS on

reactions where a spectator nuclear particle replaces the photon. We first
develop the elaborate formalism for both, direct and sequential capture

both calculations and practical applications we parameterize the involved cross

low stellar temperatures. We calculate and compare reaction and production
rates for different processes. The direct reaction mechanism dominates by many
orders of magnitude at low temperature, where the sequential stepping stones
are energetically too expensive to use. At somewhat higher temperatures these
two different nuclear four-body mechanisms become comparable. Comparison to
radiative three-body capture reveals already formally, but also numerically,

empirically observed, the concentrations have not been defined and analytical
approaches remain scarce, focusing on limiting system and not considering
parameter scaling as system size increases. We found that optimal QAOA circuit
parameters concentrate as an inverse polynomial in the problem size, providing
an optimistic result for improving circuit training. Our results are
analytically demonstrated for variational state preparations at $p=1,2$

also applicable for higher depths and the concentration effect is cross

is a challenging procedure, as they provide data only in two dimensions and
state-of-the-art calibration procedures require the use of specialised
calibration targets. This paper presents a novel method to extract the
translation-part of the hand-eye calibration matrix with rotation-part known a
priori in a target-agnostic way. Our methodology is applicable to any 2D image
or 3D object as a calibration target and can also be performed in situ in the
final application. The method is experimentally validated on a real
robot-sensor setup with 2D and 3D targets.

ever built, is instrumented with a ground array of 1600 water-Cherenkov
detectors, known as the Surface Detector (SD). The SD samples the secondary
particle content (mostly photons, electrons, positrons and muons) of extensive
air showers initiated by cosmic rays with energies ranging from $10^{17}~$eV up
to more than $10^{20}~$eV. Measuring the independent contribution of the muon
component to the total registered signal is crucial to enhance the capability
of the Observatory to estimate the mass of the cosmic rays on an event-by-event
basis. However, with the current design of the SD, it is difficult to
straightforwardly separate the contributions of muons to the SD time traces
from those of photons, electrons and positrons. In this paper, we present a
method aimed at extracting the muon component of the time traces registered
with each individual detector of the SD using Recurrent Neural Networks. We
derive the performances of the method by training the neural network on
simulations, in which the muon and the electromagnetic components of the traces
are known. We conclude this work showing the performance of this method on
experimental data of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We find that our predictions
agree with the parameterizations obtained by the AGASA collaboration to
describe the lateral distributions of the electromagnetic and muonic components
of extensive air showers.

can catalyze ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. Their enzyme kinetics are controlled
by internal subunit rotation, by substrate and product concentrations, by
mechanical inhibitory mechanisms, but also by the electrochemical potential of
protons across the membrane. Single-molecule F\""orster resonance energy
transfer (smFRET) has been used to detect subunit rotation within FoF1-ATP
synthases embedded in freely diffusing liposomes. We now report that kinetic
monitoring of functional rotation can be prolonged from milliseconds to seconds
by utilizing an Anti-Brownian electrokinetic trap (ABEL trap). These extended
observation times allowed us to observe fluctuating rates of functional
rotation for individual FoF1-liposomes in solution. Broad distributions of
ATP-dependent catalytic rates were revealed. The buildup of an electrochemical
potential of protons was confirmed to limit the maximum rate of ATP hydrolysis.
In the presence of ionophores or uncouplers, the fastest subunit rotation
speeds measured in single reconstituted FoF1-ATP synthases were 180 full rounds
per second. This was much faster than measured by biochemical ensemble
averaging, but not as fast as the maximum rotational speed reported previously
for isolated single F1 complexes uncoupled from the membrane-embedded Fo
complex. Further application of ABEL trap measurements should help resolve the
mechanistic causes of such fluctuating rates of subunit rotation.

exchange interaction between localized magnetic moments and conduction
electrons that leads to the well-known Kondo effect. In a Kondo lattice, the
interaction between the localized moments gives rise to a band with heavy
effective mass. This intriguing phenomenology has so far only been realized in
compounds containing rare-earth elements with 4f or 5f electrons. Here, we
realize a designer van der Waals heterostructure where artificial heavy
fermions emerge from the Kondo coupling between a lattice of localized magnetic

the heterostructure using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy

  We study this problem when $\Lambda$ is either the Rado graph $R$ or the

  For countable complete graphs, we show some non existence results when the
domination numbers of the graphs in $\mathcal{F}$ are finite. More precisely,
we show that there is no factorization of $K_{\mathbb{N}}$ into copies of a

their corresponding size and composition dependent opacities. The resulting
aspect ratios are almost constant with orbital distance, resulting in radially
constant pebble isolation masses, the mass where pebble accretion stops. This
supports the ""peas-in-a-pod"" constraint from the Kepler observations. The
derived pebble sizes are used to calculate the growth rates of planetary
embryos via pebble accretion. Discs with low levels of turbulence (expressed

larger particles, hence lead to smaller pebble isolation masses, and the
contrary. At the same time, small pebble sizes lead to low accretion rates. We
find that there is a trade-off between the pebble isolation mass and the growth
timescale with the best set of parameters being an $\alpha$-viscosity of
$10^{-3}$ and a dust fragmentation velocity of 10 m/s, mainly for an initial
gas surface density (at 1 AU) greater than 1000 $\rm{g/cm^2}$. A

quantum dot with a local two-particle interaction. The dot degree of freedom is
in addition coupled to a phonon mode. This setup combines the nonequilibrium
physics of the interacting resonant level model and that of the
Anderson-Holstein model. The fermion-fermion interaction defies a perturbative
treatment. We mainly focus on the antiadiabatic limit, with the phonon
frequency being larger than the lead-dot tunneling rate. In this regime also
the fermion-boson coupling cannot be treated perturbatively. Our goal is
two-fold. We investigate the competing roles of the fermion-fermion and
fermion-boson interactions on the emergent low-energy scale $T_{\rm K}$ and
show how $T_{\rm K}$ manifests in the transport coefficients as well as the
current-voltage characteristics. For small to intermediate interactions, the
latter is in addition directly affected by both interactions independently.
With increasing fermion-boson interaction the Franck-Condon blockade suppresses
the current at small voltages and the emission of phonons leads to shoulders or
steps at multiples of the phonon frequency, while the local fermion-fermion
interaction implies a negative differential conductance at voltages larger than
$T_{\rm K}$. We, in addition, use the model to investigate the limitations of
our low-order truncated functional renormalization group approach on the
Keldysh contour. In particular, we quantify the role of the broken current
conservation.

to an interesting issue that has received growing attention over the last
decades. These relationships have multiple natures, ranging from providing
habitat for animal life to temperature and humidity dynamics. Several methods
based on area, size, shape, and distance have been considered in the
literature. Given that several important contributions of green regions to
urban areas involve temperature, humidity and gases (e.g.~oxygen) exchanges,
which are intrinsically related to physical diffusion, it becomes particularly
interesting to simulate the diffusion of green effects over urban areas as a
means of better understanding the respective influences. The present work
reports a related approach. Once the green regions of a given city are
automatically identified by semantic segmentation and have eventual artifacts
eliminated, successive convolutions are applied as a means to obtain the
unfolding of the diffusion of the green effects along time. As illustrated, the
diffusion dynamics is intrinsically interesting because it can be strongly
affected by the spatial distribution of the green mass. In particular, we
observed that smaller green regions could substantially contribute to the
diffusion. The reported approach has been illustrated with respect to the
Brazilian city of Ribeirao Preto, whose small and medium-sized green regions
were found to complement in an effective manner the diffusion of the green
effects as inferred from the performed simulations under specific parameter
settings.

kinetic energy in compressible three-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence, by
means of two direct numerical simulations of decaying turbulence with initial
Mach numbers M = 1/3 and M = 1, and with moderate Reynolds numbers, R_lambda ~
100. The turbulent dynamics is analyzed using compressible and incompressible
versions of the dynamic spectral transfer (ST) and the Karman-Howarth-Monin
(KHM) equations. We find that the nonlinear coupling leads to a flux of the
kinetic energy to small scales where it is dissipated; at the same time, the
reversible pressure-dilatation mechanism causes oscillatory exchanges between
the kinetic and internal energies with an average zero net energy transfer.
While the incompressible KHM and ST equations are not generally valid in the
simulations, their compressible counterparts are well satisfied and describe,
in a quantitatively similar way, the decay of the kinetic energy on large
scales, the cross-scale energy transfer/cascade, the pressure dilatation, and
the dissipation. There exists a simple relationship between the KHM and ST
results through the inverse proportionality between the wave vector k and the
spatial separation length l as k l ~ 3^1/2. For a given time the dissipation
and pressure-dilatation terms are strong on large scales in the KHM approach
whereas the ST terms become dominant on small scales; this is owing to the
complementary cumulative behavior of the two methods. The effect of pressure
dilatation is weak when averaged over a period of its oscillations and may lead
to a transfer of the kinetic energy from large to small scales without a net
exchange between the kinetic and internal energies. Our results suggest that
for large-enough systems there exists an inertial range for the kinetic energy
cascade ...

Given that such autonomous systems can cause severe harm to individuals and
social groups, fairness concerns have arisen. A human-centric approach demanded
by scholars and policymakers requires taking people's fairness perceptions into
account when designing and implementing ADM. We provide a comprehensive,
systematic literature review synthesizing the existing empirical insights on
perceptions of algorithmic fairness from 39 empirical studies spanning multiple
domains and scientific disciplines. Through thorough coding, we systemize the
current empirical literature along four dimensions: (a) algorithmic predictors,
(b) human predictors, (c) comparative effects (human decision-making vs.
algorithmic decision-making), and (d) consequences of ADM. While we identify
much heterogeneity around the theoretical concepts and empirical measurements
of algorithmic fairness, the insights come almost exclusively from
Western-democratic contexts. By advocating for more interdisciplinary research
adopting a society-in-the-loop framework, we hope our work will contribute to
fairer and more responsible ADM.

of test particles in spacetimes with arbitrary energy-momentum distributions in
the first post-Newtonian (1PN) approximation. We apply our formalism to orbital
motion in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes and obtain the 1PN relativistic
corrections to the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies for quasi-circular
equatorial motion, a result potentially interesting for galactic dynamics. For
the case of razor-thin disk configurations, we obtain an approximated third
integral which could be used to determine analytically the envelope of nearly
equatorial orbits. One of the main advantages of this 1PN analysis is the
explicit presence of frame-dragging effects in all pertinent expressions,
allowing some qualitative predictions in rotating spacetimes. We finish
discussing the 1PN collisionless Boltzmann equation in terms of the Hamiltonian
canonical variables and its relation with previous results in the literature.

techniques required by these domains differ from traditional clustering methods

  Carlo Method",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The actor-critic RL is widely used in various robotic control tasks. By
viewing the actor-critic RL from the perspective of variational inference (VI),
the policy network is trained to obtain the approximate posterior of actions
given the optimality criteria. However, in practice, the actor-critic RL may
yield suboptimal policy estimates due to the amortization gap and insufficient
exploration. In this work, inspired by the previous use of Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) in VI, we propose to integrate the policy network of actor-critic
RL with HMC, which is termed as {\it Hamiltonian Policy}. As such we propose to
evolve actions from the base policy according to HMC, and our proposed method
has many benefits. First, HMC can improve the policy distribution to better
approximate the posterior and hence reduce the amortization gap. Second, HMC
can also guide the exploration more to the regions of action spaces with higher
Q values, enhancing the exploration efficiency. Further, instead of directly
applying HMC into RL, we propose a new leapfrog operator to simulate the
Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, in safe RL problems, we find that the proposed
method can not only improve the achieved return, but also reduce safety
constraint violations by discarding potentially unsafe actions. With
comprehensive empirical experiments on continuous control baselines, including
MuJoCo and PyBullet Roboschool, we show that the proposed approach is a
data-efficient and easy-to-implement improvement over previous actor-critic
methods.

optimal policy from a fixed dataset without active data collection. Based on
the composition of the offline dataset, two main categories of methods are
used: imitation learning which is suitable for expert datasets and vanilla
offline RL which often requires uniform coverage datasets. From a practical
standpoint, datasets often deviate from these two extremes and the exact data
composition is usually unknown a priori. To bridge this gap, we present a new
offline RL framework that smoothly interpolates between the two extremes of
data composition, hence unifying imitation learning and vanilla offline RL. The
new framework is centered around a weak version of the concentrability
coefficient that measures the deviation from the behavior policy to the expert
policy alone.
  Under this new framework, we further investigate the question on algorithm
design: can one develop an algorithm that achieves a minimax optimal rate and
also adapts to unknown data composition? To address this question, we consider
a lower confidence bound (LCB) algorithm developed based on pessimism in the
face of uncertainty in offline RL. We study finite-sample properties of LCB as
well as information-theoretic limits in multi-armed bandits, contextual
bandits, and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our analysis reveals surprising
facts about optimality rates. In particular, in all three settings, LCB
achieves a faster rate of $1/N$ for nearly-expert datasets compared to the
usual rate of $1/\sqrt{N}$ in offline RL, where $N$ is the number of samples in
the batch dataset. In the case of contextual bandits with at least two
contexts, we prove that LCB is adaptively optimal for the entire data
composition range, achieving a smooth transition from imitation learning to
offline RL. We further show that LCB is almost adaptively optimal in MDPs.

Alfv\'enic fluctuations of velocity and magnetic fields in solar wind streams
measured by Parker Solar Probe (PSP)~during the first four encounters. We use
PSP velocity and magnetic field measurements from 24 h intervals selected from
each of the first four encounters. The applicability of TH is investigated by
measuring the parameter $\epsilon=\delta u_0/\sqrt{2}V_\perp$, which quantifies
the ratio between the typical speed of large-scale fluctuations, $\delta u_0$,
and the local perpendicular PSP speed in the solar wind frame, $V_\perp$. TH is
expected to be applicable for $\epsilon\lesssim0.5$ when PSP is moving nearly
perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the plasma frame, irrespective of
the Alfv\'en Mach number $M_{\rm A}=V_{\rm SW}/V_{\rm A}$, where $V_{\rm SW}$
and $V_{\rm A}$ are the local solar wind and Alfv\'en speed, respectively. For
the four selected solar wind intervals we find that between 10% to 60% of the
time the parameter $\epsilon$ is below 0.2 when the sampling angle (between the
spacecraft velocity in the plasma frame and the local magnetic field) is
greater than $30^\circ$. For angles above $30^\circ$, the sampling direction is
sufficiently oblique to allow one to reconstruct the reduced energy spectrum
$E(k_\perp)$ of magnetic fluctuations from its measured frequency spectra. The
spectral indices determined from power-law fits of the measured frequency
spectrum accurately represent the spectral indices associated with the
underlying spatial spectrum of turbulent fluctuations in the plasma frame.
Aside from a frequency broadening due to large-scale sweeping that requires
careful consideration, the spatial spectrum can be recovered to obtain the
distribution of fluctuation's energy among scales in the plasma frame.

real-time sensing of external magnetic fields beyond classical limits. Within
the linear-Gaussian regime, thanks to the phenomenon of measurement-induced
spin-squeezing, they attain a quantum-enhanced scaling of sensitivity both as a
function of time, $t$, and the number of atoms involved, $N$. In our work, we
rigorously study how such conclusions based on Kalman filtering methods change
when inevitable imperfections are taken into account: in the form of collective
noise, as well as stochastic fluctuations of the field in time. We prove that
even an infinitesimal amount of noise disallows the error to be arbitrarily
diminished by simply increasing $N$, and forces it to eventually follow a
classical-like behaviour in $t$. However, we also demonstrate that, ""thanks"" to
the presence of noise, in most regimes the model based on a homodyne-like
continuous measurement actually achieves the ultimate sensitivity allowed by
the decoherence, yielding then the optimal quantum-enhancement. We are able to
do so by constructing a noise-induced lower bound on the error that stems from
a general method of classically simulating a noisy quantum evolution, during
which the stochastic parameter to be estimated -- here, the magnetic field --
is encoded. The method naturally extends to schemes beyond the linear-Gaussian
regime, in particular, also to ones involving feedback or active control.

[arXiv:1812.00309]. The parabolic Airy sheet provides a coupling of parabolic
Airy$_2$ processes -- a universal limiting geodesic weight profile in planar

coupling. Geodesic geometry suggests that the difference of two parabolic
Airy$_2$ processes, i.e., a difference profile, encodes important structural

first studied by Basu, Ganguly, and Hammond [arXiv:1904.01717], who showed that
it is monotone and almost everywhere constant, with its points of non-constancy
forming a set of Hausdorff dimension $1/2$. Noticing that this is also the
Hausdorff dimension of the zero set of Brownian motion, we adopt a different
approach. Establishing previously inaccessible fractal structure of
$\mathcal{D}$, we prove, on a global scale, that $\mathcal{D}$ is absolutely
continuous on compact sets to Brownian local time (of rate four) in the sense
of increments, which also yields the main result of [arXiv:1904.01717] as a
simple corollary. Further, on a local scale, we explicitly obtain Brownian
local time of rate four as a local limit of $\mathcal{D}$ at a point of
increase, picked by a number of methods, including at a typical point sampled

code analyzers can prevent major costs later on. However, developers often
ignore such issues for two main reasons. First, many issues should be
interpreted to determine if they correspond to actual flaws in the program.
Second, static analyzers often do not present the issues in a way that is
actionable. To address these problems, we present Sorald: a novel system that
devise metaprogramming templates to transform the abstract syntax trees of
programs and suggest fixes for static analysis warnings. Thus, the burden on
the developer is reduced from interpreting and fixing static issues, to
inspecting and approving full fledged solutions. Sorald fixes violations of 10
rules from SonarJava, one of the most widely used static analyzers for Java. We
evaluate Sorald on a dataset of 161 popular repositories on Github. Our
analysis shows the effectiveness of Sorald as it fixes 65% (852/1,307) of the
violations that meets the repair preconditions. Overall, our experiments show
it is possible to automatically fix notable violations of the static analysis
rules produced by the state-of-the-art static analyzer SonarJava.

removed. Also, in some cases, the previously frustrated chains are allowed to
recombine into new stable chains. As a result, we obtain a population of spin

main sequence have higher CO excitation and star formation efficiency than
galaxies with extended molecular gas reservoirs, as traced by CO(5-4)/CO(2-1)

conversion factors tailored to their ISM conditions, we measure lower gas

suggest that the sub-millimetre compactness, defined as the ratio between the

undergo substantial deceleration as they move closer to the Sun. Models of
linear magnetohydrodynamic waves have not been able to explain these
deceleration patterns, so they have been interpreted more recently as jets from
coronal sites of magnetic reconnection. In this paper, we develop a range of
dynamical models of discrete plasma parcels with the goal of better
understanding the observed deceleration trend. We found that parcels with a
constant mass do not behave like the observed flows, and neither do parcels
undergoing ablative mass loss. However, parcels that accrete mass in a
snowplow-like fashion can become decelerated as observed. We also extrapolated
OMNI in situ data down to the so-called Alfven surface and found that the
initial launch-point for the observed parcels may often be above this critical
radius. In other words, in order for the parcels to flow back down to the Sun,
their initial speeds are probably somewhat nonlinear (i.e., supra-Alfvenic) and
thus the parcels may be associated with structures such as shocks, jets, or
shear instabilities.

which are in agreement with experimental observations. These models are further
interpreted using a game-theoretic concept namely, Shapley additive

the magnitude of which is different for different properties. While the

design an effective outlier/out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, i.e., detecting
samples that lie far away from the training distribution? Since unlabeled data
is easily accessible for many applications, the most compelling approach is to
develop detectors based on only unlabeled in-distribution data. However, we
observe that most existing detectors based on unlabeled data perform poorly,
often equivalent to a random prediction. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art
OOD detectors achieve impressive performance but require access to fine-grained
data labels for supervised training. We propose SSD, an outlier detector based
on only unlabeled in-distribution data. We use self-supervised representation
learning followed by a Mahalanobis distance based detection in the feature
space. We demonstrate that SSD outperforms most existing detectors based on
unlabeled data by a large margin. Additionally, SSD even achieves performance
on par, and sometimes even better, with supervised training based detectors.
Finally, we expand our detection framework with two key extensions. First, we
formulate few-shot OOD detection, in which the detector has access to only one
to five samples from each class of the targeted OOD dataset. Second, we extend
our framework to incorporate training data labels, if available. We find that
our novel detection framework based on SSD displays enhanced performance with
these extensions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is

Stark shifts induced by strong confining light fields. By carefully balancing
light shifts between two atomic states of interest, optical traps at the magic
wavelength have been especially effective at suppressing deleterious effects
stemming from such shifts. Highlighting the power of this technique, optical
clocks today exploit Lamb-Dicke confinement in magic-wavelength optical traps,
in some cases realizing shift cancellation at the ten parts per billion level.
Theory and empirical measurements can be used at varying levels of precision to
determine the magic wavelength where shift cancellation occurs. However, lasers
exhibit background spectra from amplified spontaneous emission or other lasing
modes which can easily contaminate measurement of the magic wavelength and its
reproducibility in other experiments or conditions. Indeed, residual light
shifts from laser background have plagued optical lattice clock measurements
for years. In this work, we develop a simple theoretical model allowing
prediction of light shifts from measured background spectra. We demonstrate
good agreement between this model and measurements of the background light
shift from an amplified diode laser in an Yb optical lattice clock.
Additionally, we model and experimentally characterize the filtering effect of
a volume Bragg grating bandpass filter, demonstrating that application of the
filter can reduce background light shifts from amplified spontaneous emission
well below the $10^{-18}$ fractional clock frequency level. This demonstration
is corroborated by direct clock comparisons between a filtered amplified diode
laser and a filtered titanium:sapphire laser.

practical applications with a particularly exciting one being the simulation of

quantum computers could recreate and simulate the ground state of a physical
system. In this paper we explore a novel approach for classically simulating
the time dynamics of ASP with high accuracy, and with only modest computational
resources via an adaptive sampling configuration interaction (ASCI) scheme for
truncating the Hilbert space to only the most important determinants. We verify
that this truncation introduces negligible error, and use this new approach to
simulate ASP for sets of small molecular systems and Hubbard models. Further,
we examine two approaches to speeding up ASP when performed on quantum
hardware: (i) using the complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI)
wavefunction instead of the Hartree-Fock initial state and (ii)~a non-linear
interpolation between initial and target Hamiltonians. We find that starting
with a CASCI wavefunction with a limited active space yields substantial
speedups for many of the systems examined while non-linear interpolation does
not. Additionally, we observe interesting trends in the minimum gap location
(based on the initial state) as well as how critical time can depend on certain
molecular properties such as the number of valence electrons. Importantly, we
find that the required state preparation times do not show an immediate
exponential wall that would preclude an efficient run of ASP on actual

on the distance, but this is degenerate with the star formation history (SFH).
Using a stellar population synthesis model we calculate the number of giant
stars for stellar populations with different galaxy-wide stellar initial mass
functions (gwIMFs), ages, metallicities and SFHs. If the gwIMF is the invariant
canonical IMF, the 1$\sigma$ (3$\sigma$) uncertainty in colour allows a
distance as low as 12 Mpc (8 Mpc). If instead the true underlying gwIMF is the

11 Mpc within the 1$\sigma$ colour uncertainty. Finally, we show that our main
conclusion on the existence of a bias in the SBF distance estimation is not
much affected by changing the luminosity lower limit for counting giant stars.

the first time, we explore the effect of the initial cluster rotation and the
presence of lumps in the Galactic potential on the formation and evolution of
tidal tails. We show that the tidal tails are not naturally clustered in any
coordinate system. Models with initial rotation result in significant
differences in the cluster mass loss and follow different angular momentum time
evolution. The orientation of the tidal tails relative to the motion vector of
the cluster and the current cluster angular momentum constrain the initial
rotation of the cluster. We highlight the use of the convergent point (CP)
method in searches for co-moving groups and introduce a new compact CP (CCP)
method that accounts for internal kinematics based on an assumed model. Using
the CCP method, we are able to recover candidate members of the Hyades tidal
tails in the Gaia DR2 and eDR3 reaching a total extent of almost 1kpc. We
confirm the previously noted asymmetry in the detected tidal tails. In the eDR3
data we recovered spatial overdensities in the leading and trailing tails that
are kinematically consistent with being epicyclic overdensities and thus
present candidates for the first such detection in an open star cluster. We
show that the epicyclic overdensities are able to provide constraints not only
on the cluster properties, but also on the Galactic potential. Finally, based
on N-body simulations, a close encounter with a massive Galactic lump can
explain the observed asymmetry in the tidal tails of the Hyades.(abriged)

rise in luminosity with the coupling strength, we see a suppression (by an
order of magnitude or more compared to the dipole radiation approximation) at
moderately large coupling. At sufficiently large coupling, we find a transition
to a regime of exponential growth of the luminosity due to parametric
resonance. We carry out 3+1 dimensional lattice simulations of axion

be experimentally demonstrated. Here, we show that magic-angle twisted trilayer
graphene (MATTG) exhibits superconductivity up to in-plane magnetic fields in

surprising for a system which is not expected to have strong spin-orbit

superconducting phase, indicating that it is not related to a possible
pseudogap phase with large superconducting amplitude pairing. More strikingly,
we observe reentrant superconductivity at large magnetic fields, which is
present in a narrower range of carrier density and displacement field. These
findings suggest that the superconductivity in MATTG is likely driven by a
mechanism resulting in non-spin-singlet Cooper pairs, where the external

respect to the binary orbital plane.The lack of spherical symmetry, together
with the non-planar geometry of these systems, causes differential precession
which might induce the propagation of warps. While gas dynamics in such
environments is well understood, little is known about dusty discs. In this
work, we analytically study the problem of dust traps formation in misaligned
circumbinary discs. We find that pile-ups may be induced not by pressure
maxima, as the usual dust traps, but by a difference in precession rates
between the gas and dust. Indeed, this difference makes the radial drift
inefficient in two locations, leading to the formation of two dust rings whose
position depends on the system parameters. This phenomenon is likely to occur
to marginally coupled dust particles $(\text{St}\gtrsim1)$ as both the effect
of gravitational and drag force are considerable. We then perform a suite of
three-dimensional SPH numerical simulations to compare the results with our
theoretical predictions. We explore the parameter space, varying stellar mass
ratio, disc thickness, radial extension, and we find a general agreement with
the analytical expectations. Such dust pile-up prevents radial drift, fosters
dust growth and may thus promote the planet formation in circumbinary discs.

massive red-nuggets formed at high-z (z>2) through a short and intense star
formation burst, that evolved passively and undisturbed until the present-day.
Relics provide a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms of star formation
at high-z. In this paper, we present the first INSPIRE Data Release, comprising
19 systems with observations completed in 2020. We use the methods already
presented in the INSPIRE Pilot, but revisiting the 1D spectral extraction. For
these 19 systems, we obtain an estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion,
fitting separately the two UVB and VIS XSH arms at their original resolution.
We estimate [Mg/Fe] abundances via line-index strength and mass-weighted
integrated stellar ages and metallicities with full spectral fitting on the
combined spectrum. Ages are generally old, in agreement with the photometric
ones, and metallicities are almost always super-solar, confirming the
mass-metallicity relation. The [Mg/Fe] ratio is also larger than solar for the
great majority of the galaxies, as expected. We find that 10 objects have
formed more than 75% of their stellar mass (M*) within 3 Gyr from the Big Bang
and classify them as relics. Among these, we identify 4 galaxies which had
already fully assembled their M* by that time. They are therefore `extreme
relics' of the ancient Universe. The INSPIRE DR1 catalogue of 10 known relics
to-date augment by a factor of 3.3 the total number of confirmed relics, also
enlarging the redshift window. It is therefore the largest publicly available
collection. Thanks to the larger number of systems, we can also better quantify
the existence of a 'degree of relicness', already hinted at the Pilot Paper.

active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Afterwards, their interactions are mediated by
their gaseous surroundings. In this work, we study the evolution of
stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within AGN disks using a
combination of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and analytic methods,
focusing on environments in which the AGN disk scale height $H$ is $\gtrsim$
the BBH sphere of influence. We model the local surroundings of the embedded
BBHs using a wind tunnel formalism and characterize different accretion regimes
based on the local properties of the disk, which range from wind-dominated to
quasi-spherical. We use our simulations to develop prescriptions for mass
accretion and drag for embedded BBHs. We use these prescriptions, along with
AGN disk models that can represent the Toomre-unstable outer regions of AGN
disks, to study the long-term evolution of the BBHs as they migrate through the
disk. We find that BBHs typically merge within $\lesssim 5-30\,{\rm Myr}$,
increasing their mass significantly in the process, allowing BBHs to enter (or
cross) the pair-instability supernova mass gap. The rate at which gas is
supplied to these BBHs often exceeds the Eddington limit, sometimes by several
orders of magnitude. We conclude that most embedded BBHs will merge before
migrating significantly in the disk. Depending on the conditions of the ambient
gas and the distance to the system, LISA can detect the transition between the
gas-dominated and gravitational wave dominated regime for inspiraling BBHs that
are formed sufficiently close to the AGN ($\lesssim$ 0.1 pc). We also discuss
possible electromagnetic signatures during and following the inspiral, finding
that it is generally unlikely but not inconceivable for the bolometric
luminosity of the BBH to exceed that of the host AGN.

indirect searches at flavor experiments, with both sensitive to different

measurements of $D-\bar{D}$ mixing at LHCb probe much of the interesting

strategies of play between each pair of players, which gives rise to {\it

they lack the flexibility to cover the different strategies across $n$ players,
with the $O(n^2)$ values of intransitivity modelled using $O(n)$ parameters,
whilst they are not parsimonious when the intransitivity is simple. We overcome
their lack of adaptability by allocating each pair of players to one of a
random number of $K$ intransitivity levels, each level representing a different

research and applications that tap onto this data has been growing, but little
attention has been devoted to the prediction of an individual's heart rate (HR)
from IMU data, when undergoing a physical activity. Would that be even
possible? If so, this could be used to design personalized sets of aerobic
exercises, for instance. In this work, we show that it is viable to obtain
accurate HR predictions from IMU data using Recurrent Neural Networks, provided
only access to HR and IMU data from a short-lived, previously executed
activity. We propose a novel method for initializing an RNN's hidden state
vectors, using a specialized network that attempts to extract an embedding of
the physical conditioning (PCE) of a subject. We show that using a
discriminator in the training phase to help the model learn whether two PCEs
belong to the same individual further reduces the prediction error. We evaluate
the proposed model when predicting the HR of 23 subjects performing a variety
of physical activities from IMU data available in public datasets (PAMAP2,
PPG-DaLiA). For comparison, we use as baselines the only model specifically
proposed for this task and an adapted state-of-the-art model for Human Activity
Recognition (HAR), a closely related task. Our method, PCE-LSTM, yields over
10% lower mean absolute error. We demonstrate empirically that this error
reduction is in part due to the use of the PCE. Last, we use the two datasets
(PPG-DaLiA, WESAD) to show that PCE-LSTM can also be successfully applied when
photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors are available, outperforming the
state-of-the-art deep learning baselines by more than 30%.

system with a non-trivial Point Spread Function, and the relation between the
transmission factor and the coherence properties of an imaged object is
universal -- we demonstrate the rigorous proof of this statement, based on the
principles of quantum mechanics. The fundamental limit on the precision of
estimating separation between two partially coherent sources is then derived.
The careful study of the role of photon losses allows to resolve conflicting
claims present in previous works. We compute the Quantum Fisher Information for
the generic model of optical 4f imaging system, and use prior considerations to
validate the result for a general, translationally invariant imaging apparatus.
We prove that the spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) measurement, optimal for
non-coherent sources, remains optimal for an arbitrary degree of coherence.
Moreover, we show that some approximations, omnipresent in theoretical works
about optical imaging, inevitably lead to unphysical, zero-transmission models,
resulting in misleading claims regarding fundamental resolution limits.

$\Sigma_{*,2kpc}$-$M_*$ relation, while galaxies with diffuse cores evolve
along shallower trajectories. We investigate possible drivers of rapid growth
in $\Sigma_{*,2kpc}$ compared to $M_*$. Both the current sSFR gradient and the
BH accretion rate are indicators of past core growth, but are not predictors of
future core growth. Major mergers (although rare in our sample; $\sim$10%)
cause steeper core growth, except for high mass ($M_*$ >$\sim$ $10^{10}
M_{\odot}$) mergers, which are mostly dry. Disc instabilities, as measured by
the fraction of mass with Toomre Q < 2, are not predictive of rapid core
growth. Instead, rapid core growth results in more stable discs. The cumulative
black hole feedback history sets the maximum rate of core growth, preventing
rapid growth in high-mass galaxies ($M_*$ >$\sim$ $10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$). For
massive galaxies the total specific angular momentum of accreting gas is the
most important predictor of future core growth. Our results suggest that the

sensitivity of the overdensity to SMBBH mass ratio and magnetic flux through
the accretion disk. We find that the relative amplitude of the overdensity and
its associated EM periodic signal both degrade with diminishing mass ratio,
vanishing altogether somewhere between 1:2 and 1:5. Greater magnetization also
weakens the lump and any modulation of the light output. We develop a model to
describe how lump formation results from internal stress degrading faster in
the lump region than it can be rejuvenated through accretion inflow, and
predicts a threshold value in specific internal stress below which lump
formation should occur and which all our lump-forming simulations satisfy.
Thus, detection of such a modulation would provide a constraint on both

of the central region of the galaxy NGC 3351 are analyzed to constrain its
stellar populations and dust attenuation. Despite hosting a ~1 kpc
circumnuclear starburst ring, NGC 3351 deviates from the IRX-beta relation, the
relation between the infrared-to-UV luminosity ratio and the UV continuum slope
(beta) that other starburst galaxies follow. To understand the reason for the
deviation, we leverage the high angular resolution of archival nearUV-to-nearIR
HST images to divide the ring into ~60-180 pc size regions and model each
individually. We find that the UV slope of the combined intrinsic (dust-free)
stellar populations in the central region is redder than what is expected for a
young model population. This is due to the region's complex star formation
history, which boosts the nearUV emission relative to the farUV. The resulting
net attenuation curve has a UV slope that lies between those of the starburst
attenuation curve (Calzetti et al. 2000) and the Small Magellanic Cloud
extinction curve; the total-to-selective attenuation value, R'(V)=4.93, is
larger than both. As found for other star-forming galaxies, the stellar
continuum of NGC 3351 is less attenuated than the ionized gas, with
E(B-V)_{star}=0.40 E(B-V)_{gas}. The combination of the `red' intrinsic stellar
population and the new attenuation curve fully accounts for the location of the
central region of NGC 3351 on the IRX-beta diagram. Thus, the observed
characteristics result from the complex mixture of stellar populations and dust
column densities in the circumnuclear region. Despite being a sample of one,
these findings highlight the difficulty of defining attenuation curves of
general applicability outside the regime of centrally-concentrated starbursts.

must proceed via the so-called boundary layer (BL) - a region at the inner edge

from its Keplerian value. Supersonic shear arising in the BL is known to be
conducive to excitation of acoustic waves that propagate into both the accretor
and the disk, enabling angular momentum and mass transport across the BL. We
carry out a numerical exploration of different wave modes that operate near the
BL, focusing on their morphological characteristics in the innermost parts of
accretion disk. Using a large suite of simulations covering a broad range of
Mach numbers (of the supersonic shear flow in the BL), we provide accurate
characterization of the different types of modes, verifying their properties
against analytical results, when available. We discover new types of modes, in
particular, global spiral density waves launched by vortices forming in the
disk near the BL as a result of the Rossby wave instability; this instability
is triggered by the vortensity production in that region caused by the
nonlinear damping of acoustic waves. Azimuthal wavenumbers of the dominant
modes that we observe appear to increase monotonically with the Mach number of
the runs, but a particular mix of modes found in a simulation is mildly
stochastic. Our results provide a basis for better understanding of the angular
momentum and mass transport across the BL as well as the emission variability

contrast to the prevalent linear-programming-based electricity markets, we
highlight how the inclusion of second-order cone constraints improves
uncertainty-, asset- and network-awareness of the market, which is key to the
successful transition towards an electricity system based on weather-dependent
renewable energy sources. We analyze our general market-clearing proposal using
conic duality theory to derive efficient spatially-differentiated prices for
the multiple commodities, comprising of energy and flexibility services. Under
the assumption of perfect competition, we prove the equivalence of the
centrally-solved market-clearing optimization problem to a competitive spatial
price equilibrium involving a set of rational and self-interested participants
and a price setter. Finally, under common assumptions, we prove that moving
towards conic markets does not incur the loss of desirable economic properties
of markets, namely market efficiency, cost recovery and revenue adequacy. Our
numerical studies focus on the specific use case of uncertainty-aware market
design and demonstrate that the proposed conic market brings advantages over
existing alternatives within the linear programming market framework.

expected to favor large soft terms as a power-law or log distribution, but

large a value for the derived weak scale -- a violation of the atomic
principle. Indeed, scans of such vacua yield a statistical prediction for light
Higgs boson mass m_h~ 125 GeV with sparticles (save possibly light higgsinos)
typically beyond LHC reach. In contrast, models of dynamical SUSY breaking
(DSB) -- with a hidden sector gauge coupling g^2 scanned uniformly -- lead to
gaugino condensation and a uniform distribution of soft parameters on a log
scale. Then soft terms are expected to be distributed as $m_{\rm soft}^{-1}$
favoring small values. A scan of DSB soft terms generally leads to $m_h\ll 125$
GeV and sparticle masses usually below LHC limits. Thus, the DSB landscape

physically offset from their halo centres, in the Romulus cosmological
simulations. Unlike most other currently available cosmological simulations,
black holes are seeded based on local gas properties and are permitted to
evolve dynamically without being fixed at halo centres. Tracking these black
holes allows us to make robust predictions about the offset population. We find
that the number of wandering black holes scales roughly linearly with the halo
mass, such that we expect thousands of wandering black holes in galaxy cluster
halos. Locally, these wanderers account for around 10 per cent of the local
black hole mass budget once seed masses are accounted for. Yet for higher
redshifts ($z\gtrsim 4$), wandering black holes both outweigh and outshine
their central supermassive counterparts. Most wandering black holes, we find,
remain close to the seed mass and originate from the centres of previously
disrupted satellite galaxies. While most do not retain a resolved stellar
counterpart, those that do are situated farther out at larger fractions of the
virial radius. Wanderers with higher luminosities are preferentially at lower
radius, more massive, and either closer to their host's mid-planes or
associated with a stellar overdensity. This analysis shows that our current
census of supermassive black holes is incomplete and that a substantial

Jupiter-mass planets at 5.2, 30, 50 AU distance from their star. We found that
the meridional circulation \citep{Szulagyi14,FC16} drives a strong vertical
flow for the dust as well, hence the dust is not settled in the midplane, even
for mm-sized grains. The meridional circulation will deliver dust and gas
vertically onto the circumplanetary region, efficiently bridging over the gap.
The Hill-sphere accretion rates for the dust are $\sim10^{-8}$ to $10^{-10}$
$\rm{M_{Jup}/yr}$, increasing with planet-mass. For the gas component, the gain
is $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-8}$ $\rm{M_{Jup}/yr}$. The difference between the dust

vicinity of the planet, the mm-grains can get trapped easier than the gas,
which means the circumplanetary disk might be enriched with solids in
comparison to the circumstellar disk. We calculated the local dust-to-gas ratio

galaxies: M51, NGC3627 and NGC628. Based on linear perturbation analysis
considering multiple components in the galaxies, we compute instability
parameters of the spiral arms using their observational data and argue whether
the arms will fragment by their self-gravity. Our analysis utilises
observations of carbon monoxide (CO), 21-centimetre line emission and
multi-band photometric images for molecular gas, atomic gas and stellar
components in the arms, respectively. We find that the grand-design arms of
these galaxies indicate marginally stable states, and hence they are not on the
way to fragment. We consider this to be consistent with the commonness of
spiral galaxies and the relative rarity of fragmented discs at low redshifts.
In the analysis, molecular gas is the dominant component to determine the
(in)stability of the arms, whereas atomic gas and stars are far less important.
Therefore, the results of our analysis are sensitive to an assumed
CO-to-H$_{\rm 2}$ conversion factor. If we assume a typical scatter of the
measurements and admit nearly twice as large a conversion factor as our
fiducial value, our analysis results in predicting the instability for the

into interactions between various parties. In many respects, the situation is
similar to the early days of the Internet, where, prior to the establishment of
Internet Exchanges, routing between different BGP autonomous systems was often
point to point. We propose a similar solution, the IoT Exchange, where IoT
device owners can register their devices and offer data for sale or can upload
data into the IoT services of any of the big hyperscale cloud platforms for
further processing. The goal of the IoT Exchange is to break down the silos
within which device wireless connectivity types and cloud provider IoT systems
constrain users to operate. In addition, if the device owner needs to maintain
the data close to the edge to reduce access latency, the MillenniumDB service
running in an edge data center with minimal latency to the edge device,
provides a database with a variety of schema engines (SQL, noSQL, etc). The IoT
exchange uses decentralized identifiers for identity management and verifiable
credentials for authorizing software updates and to control access to the
devices, to avoid dependence on certificate authorities and other centralized
identity and authorization management systems. In addition, verifiable
credentials provide a way whereby privacy preserving processing can be applied
to traffic between a device and an end data or control customer, if some risk

Method of a cylinder in uniform fluid flow attached to bistable springs
undergoing Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV). The elastic spring potential for
the bistable springs, consisting of 2 potential wells, is defined by the
spacing between the potential minima and the depth of the potential wells. We
perform simulations of VIV with linear spring, as well as bistable springs with
two different inter-well separations, over a wide range of reduced velocity. As
expected, large oscillation amplitudes correspond to lock-in of the lift force
with the natural frequency of the spring-mass system. The range of reduced
velocity over which lock-in occurs is significantly higher for VIV with
bistable springs compared to VIV with linear springs, although the maximum
possible amplitude appears to be independent of the spring type. For VIV with
bistable springs, the cylinder undergoes double-well oscillations in the
lock-in regime. Range of reduced velocity over which lock-in occurs increases
when the inter-well distance is reduced. The vortex shedding patterns and
amplitude trends look similar at the same equivalent reduced velocity for the
different springs. The results here are consistent with our prior theory, in
which we propose a new ""Equilibrium-Constraint (EC)"" based on average kinetic
energy budget of the structure. For a given spring potential, the intersection
of natural frequency curves with the EC curve yields the possible range of
reduced velocities over which lock-in should occur. Our numerical simulations
show a collapse of the amplitude-versus-structure frequency data for all the
simulations onto roughly the same curve, thus supporting the existence of the
EC, and providing an explanation for the trends in the VIV oscillations.

system, fog access points (F-APs) and cache-enabled D2D (CE-D2D) users are
equipped with local caches for alleviating traffic burden at the fronthaul,
while users' contents can be easily and quickly accommodated. In CLNC, the
coding decisions take users' contents, their rates, and power levels of F-APs

goal, a joint content placement and delivery problem is formulated as an
optimization problem with a goal to maximize system sum-rate. For this NP-hard
problem, we first develop an innovative decentralized CLNC coalition formation
(CLNC-CF) algorithm to obtain a stable solution for the content delivery

taking the behavior of F-APs and CE-D2D users into account, we then develop a

chemical evolution of water during star formation and the chemical diversity
during the star formation process and in young planetary systems. Methods: The
evolution of water is modeled using 3D physicochemical models of a dynamic
star-forming environment. The physical evolution during the protostellar
collapse is described by tracer particles from a 3D MHD simulation of a
molecular cloud region. Each particle trajectory is post-processed using
RADMC-3D to calculate the temperature and radiation field. The chemical
evolution is simulated using a three-phase grain-surface chemistry model and
the results are compared with interferometric observations of H$_2$O, HDO, and
D$_2$O in hot corinos toward low-mass protostars. Results: The physicochemical
model reproduces the observed HDO/H$_2$O and D$_2$O/HDO ratios in hot corinos,
but shows no correlation with cloud environment for similar identical
conditions. The observed dichotomy in water D/H ratios requires variation in
the initial conditions (e.g., the duration and temperature of the prestellar
phase). Reproducing the observed D/H ratios in hot corinos requires a
prestellar phase duration $t\sim$1-3 Myr and temperatures in the range $T \sim$
10-20 K prior to collapse. This work demonstrates that the observed
differentiation between clustered and isolated protostars stems from
differences in the molecular cloud or prestellar core conditions and does not
arise during the protostellar collapse itself.

an appealing alternative to current low-communication load balancing
techniques. In PI, servers only update the dispatcher when they become idle,
and the dispatcher always sends jobs to the last server that reported being
idle. PI is unique in that it does not seek to push the server queue lengths
towards equalization greedily. Rather, it aggressively pulls the servers away
from starvation. As a result, PI's analysis requires different tools than other
load balancing approaches. So far, PI was proven to achieve the stability
region for Bernoulli arrivals and deterministic and constant service
capacities.
  Our main contribution is proving that PI achieves the stability region in a
model with batch arrivals and random service capacities. Proving this result
requires developing tighter bounds on quantities of interest and proving the
fulfillment of a generalized version of the state-dependent drift criteria
previously considered. We also present PI-Split, which allows batches to be
split among idle servers and prove its stability. Finally, we conduct
simulations comparing PI and PI-Split to other load balancing policies.
Simulation results indicate that both achieve excellent performance for the
model under consideration for a wide range of parameters.

ceiling effect have been well-studied in the context of undirected networks.
However, the lack of an intuitive, theoretically tractable model of a directed,
bi-populated~(i.e.,~containing two groups) network with variable levels of
preferential attachment, homophily and growth dynamics~(e.g.,~the rate at which
new nodes join, whether the new nodes mostly follow existing nodes or the
existing nodes follow them, etc.) has largely prevented such consequences from
being explored in the context of directed networks, where they more naturally
occur due to the asymmetry of links. To this end, we present a rigorous
theoretical analysis of the \emph{Directed Mixed Preferential Attachment} model
and, use it to analyze the glass ceiling effect in directed networks. More
specifically, we derive the closed-form expressions for the power-law exponents
of the in- and out- degree distributions of each group~(minority and majority)
and, compare them with each other to obtain insights. In particular, our
results yield answers to questions such as: \emph{when does the minority group
have a heavier out-degree (or in-degree) distribution compared to the majority
group? what effect does frequent addition of edges between existing nodes have
on the in- and out- degree distributions of the majority and minority groups?}.
Such insights shed light on the interplay between the structure~(i.e., the in-
and out- degree distributions of the two groups) and dynamics~(characterized
collectively by the homophily, preferential attachment, group sizes and growth
dynamics) of various real-world networks. Finally, we utilize the obtained
analytical results to characterize the conditions under which the glass ceiling
effect emerge in a directed network. Our analytical results are supported by
detailed numerical results.

multi-wavelength data have opened potential new windows into the evolution and
properties of otherwise dormant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centres

some properties and differ in others. The range in properties is broad enough
to overlap other transient types, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and
supernovae (SNe), which can make TDE classification ambiguous. A further
complication is that ""TDE signatures"" have not been uniformly observed to
similar sensitivities or even targeted across all candidates. This chapter
reviews those events that are unusual relative to other TDEs, including the
possibility of TDEs in pre-existing AGN, and summarises those characteristics
thought to best distinguish TDEs from continuously accreting AGN, strongly
flaring AGN, SNe, and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), as well as other potential
impostors like stellar collisions, ""micro-TDEs,"" and circumbinary accretion
flows. We conclude that multiple observables should be used to classify any one
event as a TDE. We also consider the TDE candidate population as a whole,
which, for certain host galaxy or SMBH characteristics, is distinguishable
statistically from non-TDEs, suggesting that at least some TDE candidates do in
fact arise from SMBH-disrupted stars.

research area for hybrid analog/digital systems in mm-wave massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). This paper investigates
interference-aware pre-beamformer (analog beamformer) design for joint spatial
division and multiplexing (JSDM) which is a user-grouping based two-stage
beamforming method. Single-carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) is
employed in uplink frequency-selective channels. First, unconstrained slowly
changing statistical analog beamformer of each group, namely, generalized
eigenbeamformer (GEB) which has strong interference suppression capability is
designed where the mutual information in reduced dimension is maximized. Then,
constant-modulus constrained approximations of unconstrained beamformer are
obtained by utilizing alternating minimization algorithms for fully connected
arrays and fixed subarrays. In addition, a dynamic subarray algorithm is
proposed where the connections between radio frequency (RF) chains and antennas
are changed with changing channel statistics. Convergence of the proposed
alternating minimization-based algorithms are provided along with their
complexity analysis. It is observed that additional complexity of proposed
algorithms is insignificant for the overall system design. Although most of the
interference is suppressed with the help of proposed constrained beamformers,
there may be some residual interference after the analog beamforming stage.
Therefore, linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) type digital beamformers,
which take the residual interference in reduced dimension into account, are
proposed instead of zero-forcing (ZF) type. Simulation results verify the
superiority of the proposed interference-aware constrained design over existing
approaches in terms of beampattern, spectral efficiency, outage capacity and
channel estimation accuracy.

$\sim$ 10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These characteristics are not consistent with
jet and host galaxy dilution. A potential scenario to explain this AGN
quiescence in the optical is a sky-covering ""cocoon"" of obscuring material,
such that the AGN ionising radiation is unable to escape and excite gas on kpc

of unobserved heterogeneity, which reflect differences in unobserved risk to be
diagnosed with a mental health condition. We then analyze mental health
development and risky health behaviors other than unwanted pregnancies across
groups. Our results suggest that these are determined by the same type of
unobserved heterogeneity, which we attribute to the same unobserved process of
decision-making. We develop and estimate a theoretical model of risky choices

therapy, for which non-invasive methods have been developed based on surface
reconstruction using optical 3D imaging. However, most solutions need expensive
specialized hardware and a careful calibration procedure that must be repeated
over time.This paper proposes a fast and cheap patient positioning method based
on inexpensive consumer level RGB-D sensors.
  METHODS: The proposed method relies on a 3D reconstruction approach that
fuses, in real-time, artificial and natural visual landmarks recorded from a
hand-held RGB-D sensor. The video sequence is transformed into a set of
keyframes with known poses, that are later refined to obtain a realistic 3D
reconstruction of the patient. The use of artificial landmarks allows our
method to automatically align the reconstruction to a reference one, without
the need of calibrating the system with respect to the linear accelerator
coordinate system.
  RESULTS:The experiments conducted show that our method obtains a median of 1
cm in translational error, and 1 degree of rotational error with respect to
reference pose. Additionally, the proposed method shows as visual output
overlayed poses (from the reference and the current scene) and an error map
that can be used to correct the patient's current pose to match the reference
pose.
  CONCLUSIONS: A novel approach to obtain 3D body reconstructions for patient
positioning without requiring expensive hardware or dedicated graphic cards is
proposed. The method can be used to align in real time the patient's current
pose to a preview pose, which is a relevant step in radiation therapy.

the recent successes in applying ML/AI methods for autonomous systems from
robotics through self-driving cars to organic and inorganic synthesis are
generating enthusiasm for the potential of these techniques to enable automated

should necessarily be discussed in a broader context of the general domain
knowledge that both informs the experiment and is increased as the result of
the experiment. As such, this analysis should explore the human and ML/AI roles
prior to and during the experiment, and consider the latencies, biases, and
knowledge priors of the decision-making process. Similarly, such discussion
should include the limitations of the existing imaging systems, including
intrinsic latencies, non-idealities and drifts comprising both correctable and
stochastic components. We further pose that the role of the AE in microscopy is
not the exclusion of human operators (as is the case for autonomous driving),
but rather automation of routine operations such as microscope tuning, etc.,
prior to the experiment, and conversion of low latency decision making
processes on the time scale spanning from image acquisition to human-level

promote future cutting-edge research in the emerging field of attosecond

the existing schemes to enhance the harmonic yield and to push the photon
energy cutoff to the extreme ultraviolet (XUV, 10-100 eV) regime and beyond
towards the spectral ""water window"" region (282-533 eV). Here, we demonstrate a
coherent control scheme of HHG, which we show to give rise to quantum
modulations in the XUV region. The control scheme is based on exploring surface
states in transition-metal surfaces, and specifically by tuning the electronic
structure of the metal surface itself together with the use of optimal chirped
pulses. Moreover, we show that the use of such pulses having moderate
intensities permits to push the harmonic cutoff further to the spectral water
window region, and that the extension is found to be robust against the change
of the intrinsic properties of the material. The scenario is numerically
implemented using a minimal model by solving the time-dependent Schrodinger
equation for the metal surface Cu(111) initially prepared in the surface state.
Our findings elucidate the importance of metal surfaces for generating coherent
isolated attosecond XUV and soft-x-ray pulses and for designing compact

distribution of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is matched to a Gamma

well as the channel pathloss. Next, by assuming FBL model, the achievable rate
expression is identified and the corresponding average rate is elaborated based
on the proposed SNR distribution. The phase error due to quantizing the phase
shifts is considered in the simulation. The numerical results show that Monte
Carlo simulations conform to the matched Gamma distribution for the received

indicated by the tightness of the SNR distribution increases when RIS is
leveraged particularly when only the reflected channel exists. This highlights
the advantages of RIS-aided communications for ultra-reliable low-latency

beneficial for natural and artificial systems. We test this hypothesis by
evolving foraging agents controlled by neural networks that can change the
system's dynamical regime throughout evolution. Surprisingly, we find that all
populations, regardless of their initial regime, evolve to be subcritical in
simple tasks and even strongly subcritical populations can reach comparable
performance. We hypothesize that the moderately subcritical regime combines the
benefits of generalizability and adaptability brought by closeness to
criticality with the stability of the dynamics characteristic for subcritical
systems. By a resilience analysis, we find that initially critical agents
maintain their fitness level even under environmental changes and degrade
slowly with increasing perturbation strength. On the other hand, subcritical
agents originally evolved to the same fitness, were often rendered utterly
inadequate and degraded faster. We conclude that although the subcritical
regime is preferable for a simple task, the optimal deviation from criticality
depends on the task difficulty: for harder tasks, agents evolve closer to
criticality. Furthermore, subcritical populations cannot find the path to
decrease their distance to criticality. In summary, our study suggests that
initializing models near criticality is important to find an optimal and
flexible solution.

on 7,399 IVF cycles resulting in 57,827 embryos. Surprisingly, we find that
both oocyte maturation and early embryo development are quantitatively
described by simple models with minimal interactions. This simplicity suggests
that oogenesis and embryogenesis are composed of modular processes that are
relatively siloed from one another. In particular, our analysis provides strong
evidence that (i) pre-antral follicles produce anti-M{\""u}llerian hormone
independently of effects from other follicles, (ii) oocytes mature to
metaphase-II independently of the woman's age, her BMI, and other factors,
(iii) early embryo development is memoryless for the variables assessed here,
in that the probability of an embryo transitioning from its current
developmental stage to the next is independent of its previous stage. Our
results both provide insight into the fundamentals of oogenesis and
embryogenesis and have implications for the clinical practice of IVF.

transportation related emissions. In public transport networks, replacing
internal combustion engine buses by electric buses provides an opportunity to
improve air quality. Hence, many bus network operators currently ask for an
optimal transformation plan to integrate battery electric buses into their
fleet. Ideally, this plan also considers the installation of necessary charging
infrastructure to ensure a fleet's operational feasibility. Against this
background, we introduce an integrated modeling approach to determine a
cost-optimal, long-term, multi-period transformation plan for integrating
battery electric buses into urban bus networks. Our model connects central
strategic and operational decisions. We minimize total cost of ownership and
analyze potential reductions of nitrogen oxide emissions. Our results base on a
case study of a real-world bus network and show that a comprehensive
integration of battery electric buses is feasible and economically beneficial.
By analyzing the impact of battery capacities and charging power on the optimal
fleet transformation, we show that medium-power charging facilities combined
with medium-capacity batteries are superior to networks with low-power or

January. We observed MAXI J1348-630 for $\sim$14 months in the radio band with
MeerKAT and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), and in the X-rays
with MAXI and Swift/XRT. Throughout the outburst we detected and tracked the
evolution of the compact and transient jets. Following the main outburst, the
system underwent at least 4 hard-state-only re-flares, during which compact
jets were again detected. For the major outburst, we observed the rise,
quenching, and re-activation of the compact jets, as well as two single-sided
discrete ejecta, launched $\sim$2 months apart and travelling away from the
black hole. These ejecta displayed the highest proper motion ($\gtrsim$100 mas
day$^{-1}$) ever measured for an accreting black hole binary. From the jet
motion, we constrain the ejecta inclination and speed to be $\leq$46$^{\circ}$
and $\geq$0.69 $c$, and the opening angle and transverse expansion speed of the
first component to be $\leq$6$^{\circ}$ and $\leq$0.05 $c$. We also infer that
the first ejection happened at the hard-to-soft state transition, before a
strong radio flare, while the second ejection was launched during a short
excursion from the soft to the intermediate state. After traveling with
constant speed, the first component underwent a strong deceleration, which was
covered with unprecedented detail and suggested that MAXI J1348-630 could be

the other epidemiological models, this model produces broader results because
it includes the additional Skeptics (Z) compartment, wherein a user may be
exposed to an item of misinformation but not engage in any reaction to it, and
the additional Exposed (E) compartment, wherein the user may need some time
before deciding to spread a misinformation item. We analyzed misinformation
regarding the unrest in Washington, D.C. in the month of March 2020 which was
propagated by the use of the #DCblackout hashtag by different users across the
U.S. on Twitter. Our analysis shows that misinformation can be modeled using
the concept of epidemiology. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the
first to attempt to apply the SEIZ epidemiological model to the spread of a
specific item of misinformation, which is a category distinct from that of
rumor, and a hoax on online social media platforms. Applying a mathematical

particles scattering on a 3.3 tonne liquid argon target. The largest background
comes from $^{39}$Ar beta decays and is suppressed using pulseshape
discrimination (PSD).
  We use two types of PSD algorithm: the prompt-fraction, which considers the
fraction of the scintillation signal in a narrow and a wide time window around
the event peak, and the log-likelihood-ratio, which compares the observed
photon arrival times to a signal and a background model. We furthermore use two
algorithms to determine the number of photons detected at a given time: (1)
simply dividing the charge of each PMT pulse by the charge of a single
photoelectron, and (2) a likelihood analysis that considers the probability to
detect a certain number of photons at a given time, based on a model for the
scintillation pulseshape and for afterpulsing in the light detectors.
  The prompt-fraction performs approximately as well as the
log-likelihood-ratio PSD algorithm if the photon detection times are not biased
by detector effects. We explain this result using a model for the information

following designated control signals -- has received unprecedented attention
over the last few years. To emulate the human ability in controlling caption
generation, current CIC studies focus exclusively on control signals concerning
objective properties, such as contents of interest or descriptive patterns.
However, we argue that almost all existing objective control signals have
overlooked two indispensable characteristics of an ideal control signal: 1)
Event-compatible: all visual contents referred to in a single sentence should
be compatible with the described activity. 2) Sample-suitable: the control
signals should be suitable for a specific image sample. To this end, we propose
a new control signal for CIC: Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR). VSR consists
of a verb and some semantic roles, which represents a targeted activity and the
roles of entities involved in this activity. Given a designated VSR, we first
train a grounded semantic role labeling (GSRL) model to identify and ground all
entities for each role. Then, we propose a semantic structure planner (SSP) to
learn human-like descriptive semantic structures. Lastly, we use a role-shift
captioning model to generate the captions. Extensive experiments and ablations
demonstrate that our framework can achieve better controllability than several
strong baselines on two challenging CIC benchmarks. Besides, we can generate
multi-level diverse captions easily. The code is available at:

  Experiments under a Structural Cumulative Survival Model",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Treatment switching in a randomized controlled trial is said to occur when a
patient randomized to one treatment arm switches to another treatment arm
during follow-up. This can occur at the point of disease progression, whereby
patients in the control arm may be offered the experimental treatment. It is
widely known that failure to account for treatment switching can seriously
dilute the estimated effect of treatment on overall survival. In this paper, we
aim to account for the potential impact of treatment switching in a re-analysis
evaluating the treatment effect of NucleosideReverse Transcriptase Inhibitors
(NRTIs) on a safety outcome (time to first severe or worse sign or symptom) in
participants receiving a new antiretroviral regimen that either included or
omitted NRTIs in the Optimized Treatment That Includes or OmitsNRTIs (OPTIONS)
trial. We propose an estimator of a treatment causal effect under a structural
cumulative survival model (SCSM) that leverages randomization as an
instrumental variable to account for selective treatment switching. Unlike
Robins' accelerated failure time model often used to address treatment
switching, the proposed approach avoids the need for artificial censoring for
estimation. We establish that the proposed estimator is uniformly consistent
and asymptotically Gaussian under standard regularity conditions. A consistent
variance estimator is also given and a simple resampling approach provides
uniform confidence bands for the causal difference comparing treatment groups
overtime on the cumulative intensity scale. We develop an R package named
""ivsacim"" implementing all proposed methods, freely available to download from
R CRAN. We examine the finite performance of the estimator via extensive

prograde and retrograde zonal jets with typical velocities of up to 100 m/s
around the equator. At much higher altitudes, in the ionosphere, strong auroral
jets have been discovered with velocities of 1-2 km/s. There is no such direct
measurement in the stratosphere of the planet. Aims. In this paper, we bridge
the altitude gap between these measurements by directly measuring the wind
speeds in Jupiter's stratosphere. Methods. We use the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array's very high spectral and angular resolution
imaging of the stratosphere of Jupiter to retrieve the wind speeds as a
function of latitude by fitting the Doppler shifts induced by the winds on the
spectral lines. Results. We detect for the first time equatorial zonal jets
that reside at 1 mbar, i.e. above the altitudes where Jupiter's
Quasi-Quadrennial Oscillation occurs. Most noticeably, we find 300-400 m/s
non-zonal winds at 0.1 mbar over the polar regions underneath the main auroral
ovals. They are in counter-rotation and lie several hundreds of kilometers
below the ionospheric auroral winds. We suspect them to be the lower tail of
the ionospheric auroral winds. Conclusions. We detect directly and for the
first time strong winds in Jupiter's stratosphere. They are zonal at low-to-mid
latitudes and non-zonal at polar latitudes. The wind system found at polar
latitudes may help increase the effciency of chemical complexification by
confining the photochemical products in a region of large energetic electron
precipitation.

it allows for appearance and depth being on direct pixelwise correspondence
without further calibration. Best MDE models are based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) trained in a supervised manner, i.e., assuming pixelwise ground
truth (GT). Usually, this GT is acquired at training time through a calibrated
multi-modal suite of sensors. However, also using only a monocular system at
training time is cheaper and more scalable. This is possible by relying on
structure-from-motion (SfM) principles to generate self-supervision.
Nevertheless, problems of camouflaged objects, visibility changes,
static-camera intervals, textureless areas, and scale ambiguity, diminish the
usefulness of such self-supervision. In this paper, we perform monocular depth
estimation by virtual-world supervision (MonoDEVS) and real-world SfM
self-supervision. We compensate the SfM self-supervision limitations by
leveraging virtual-world images with accurate semantic and depth supervision

emerging streams of training data. When trained sequentially on new or evolving
tasks, their performance degrades sharply, making them inappropriate in
real-world use cases. Existing methods tackle it by either storing old data
samples or only updating a parameter set of DNNs, which, however, demands a
large memory budget or spoils the flexibility of models to learn the
incremented class distribution. In this paper, we shed light on an on-call
transfer set to provide past experiences whenever a new class arises in the
data stream. In particular, we propose a Zero-Shot Incremental Learning not
only to replay past experiences the model has learned but also to perform this
in a zero-shot manner. Towards this end, we introduced a memory recovery
paradigm in which we query the network to synthesize past exemplars whenever a
new task (class) emerges. Thus, our method needs no fixed-sized memory, besides
calls the proposed memory recovery paradigm to provide past exemplars, named a
transfer set in order to mitigate catastrophically forgetting the former

paradigm does not desire a parallel architecture since it only relies on the

The protocol is based on conductance measurements in a three-terminal device

acts as a proxy for the measurement of local conductance, allowing a rapid,
systematic scan of the large experimental phase space of the device. Majorana
zero modes cause zero bias conductance peaks at each end of the wire, so we
identify promising regions of the phase space by filtering for this condition.
To validate the presence of a topological phase, a subsequent measurement of
the non-local conductance in these regions is used to detect a topological
transition via the closing and reopening of the bulk energy gap. We define data
analysis routines that allow for an automated and unbiased execution of the
protocol. Our protocol is designed to screen out false positives, especially
trivial Andreev bound states that mimic Majorana zero modes in local

investigated using single wavelength simulations (SWS), multiple wavelength
simulations (MWS), and laboratory experiments. The rightward and leftward
propagating instabilities are separated with the two-dimensional discrete
Fourier transform, enabling a direct comparison of the perturbation fields
between the numerical simulations and linear stability analysis. The
decomposition and superposition of the perturbation fields provide a new
insight into the origin of Reynolds stresses. Conventionally, only the
statistics of horizontal and vertical velocity perturbation pairs, ($u',w'$),
are presented to show the degree of anisotropy in turbulent fields. Here, we
present these ($u',w'$)-pairs using both theory-based and statistical
approaches to reveal the mechanism of the anisotropy of perturbation field. For
an individual Holmboe mode, both the simulations and linear theory show that
($u',w'$)-pairs tilt towards the 2nd and 4th quadrants ($u'w'<0$) within upper
and lower vorticity interfaces, indicating an anisotropic perturbation field.
As a result, a negative correlation between the horizontal and vertical
velocity perturbation is produced, $i.e.$ negative Reynolds stresses on
average. Combining the leftward and rightward Holmboe modes, ($u',w'$)-pairs
are also ellipses whose orientation and aspect ratio are phase dependent. The
joint probability density functions of ($u',w'$) in the linear theory and SWS
show `steering wheel' structures, while in MWS and laboratory experiments the
presence of waves of varying wavelength smears out the `steering wheel'
structure leaving an elliptical cloud with similar orientation to the
corresponding linear prediction. The vertical structure of the Reynolds
stresses in the simulations and the laboratory experiment agree with the linear
stability predictions.

We investigate the application of an explainability concept to enhance the FDD
accuracy of a deep neural network model trained with a data set of relatively
small number of samples. The explainability is quantified by a novel relevance
measure of input variables that is calculated from a Layerwise Relevance
Propagation (LRP) algorithm. It is shown that the relevances can be used to
discard redundant input feature vectors/ variables iteratively thus resulting
in reduced over-fitting of noisy data, increasing distinguishability between
output classes and superior FDD test accuracy. The efficacy of the proposed
method is demonstrated on the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process.

mechanism for miners to commit resources to create blocks and in effect secure

(i) a fixed reward for each block (e.g., Ethereum), or (ii) one where the block
reward halves every set number of blocks (e.g., the Bitcoin model of halving
roughly every 4 years) but otherwise remains fixed between halvings. In recent
work, a game-theoretic analysis of the static model under asymmetric miner
costs showed that an equilibrium always exists and is unique. Their analysis
also reveals how asymmetric costs can lead to large-scale centralization in
blockchain mining, a phenomenon that has been observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum
and highlighted by other studies. In this work we introduce a novel family of
mining reward functions, HaPPY-Mine (HAsh-Pegged Proportional Yield), which peg
the value of the reward to the hashrate of the system, decreasing the reward as
the hashrate increases. HaPPY-Mine distributes rewards in proportion to
expended hashrate and inherits the safety properties of the generalized
proportional reward function. We study HaPPY-Mine under a heterogeneous miner

miner participants and a unique total hashrate. Significantly, we prove that a
HaPPY-Mine equilibrium is more decentralized than the static model equilibrium
under a set of metrics including number of mining participants and hashrate

Much of the current interest has focused on the effects of magneto-elastic
coupling on these interactions under mechanical stimuli, such as uniaxial
stresses for future applications in spintronics devices. Recent studies suggest
that skyrmion shape deformations in thin films are attributed to an anisotropy
in the coefficient of DMI, such that $D_{x}\!\not=\!D_{y}$, which makes the
ratio $\lambda/D$ anistropic, where the coefficient of FMI $\lambda$ is
isotropic. It is also possible that $\lambda_{x}\!\not=\!\lambda_{y}$ while $D$
is isotropic for $\lambda/D$ to be anisotropic. In this paper, we study this
problem using a new modeling technique constructed based on Finsler geometry
(FG). Two possible FG models are examined: In the first (second) model, the FG
modeling prescription is applied to the FMI (DMI) Hamiltonian. We find that
these two different FG models' results are consistent with the reported
experimental data for skyrmion deformation. We also study responses of helical

The retrieval model is typically trained to maximize the likelihood of the

evidence candidates. Moreover, not all such candidates are labeled as positive

is exacerbated when the questions are unanswerable or when the answers are

of set-valued retrieval that handles unanswerable queries, and we show that
marginalizing over this set during training allows a model to mitigate false
negatives in supporting evidence annotations. We test our method on two

subsequent step that performs domain-specific refinements or reranking by
leveraging operations such as geometric verification based on local features.
In this work, we propose Reranking Transformers (RRTs) as a general model to
incorporate both local and global features to rerank the matching images in a
supervised fashion and thus replace the relatively expensive process of
geometric verification. RRTs are lightweight and can be easily parallelized so
that reranking a set of top matching results can be performed in a single
forward-pass. We perform extensive experiments on the Revisited Oxford and
Paris datasets, and the Google Landmarks v2 dataset, showing that RRTs
outperform previous reranking approaches while using much fewer local
descriptors. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike existing approaches, RRTs
can be optimized jointly with the feature extractor, which can lead to feature
representations tailored to downstream tasks and further accuracy improvements.

incremental learning capability for robotic vision. Further, there is no
dataset or benchmark specifically designed for incremental object learning from
a few examples. To fill this gap, we present a new dataset termed F-SIOL-310
(Few-Shot Incremental Object Learning) which is specifically captured for
testing few-shot incremental object learning capability for robotic vision. We
also provide benchmarks and evaluations of 8 incremental learning algorithms on

with sub-linear static regret were designed. In this work, we build on this
framework and propose Avare, a simple and efficient algorithm for adaptive
importance sampling for finite-sum optimization and sampling with decreasing

$\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ and $\mathcal{O}(T^{5/6})$ dynamic regret for SGD and
SGLD respectively when run with $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ step sizes. We achieve this

electricity production, play an important role in managing renewable energy
variability. However, these changes in electricity production translate into
variability in the consumption of natural gas, and propagate uncertainty from
the electric grid to the natural gas system. To ensure that both systems are
operating safely, there is an increasing need for coordination and uncertainty
management among the electricity and gas networks. A challenging aspect of this
coordination is the consideration of natural gas dynamics, which play an
important role at the time scale of interest, but give rise to a set of
non-linear and non-convex equations that are hard to optimize over even in the
deterministic case. Many conventional methods for stochastic optimization
cannot be used because they either incorporate a large number of scenarios
directly or require the underlying problem to be convex. To address these

more efficiently solve these problems and investigate several different

that Jclocal shows a trend to be improved when four or five RE elements are

center of a sentence. Identifying predicate heads is critical to understanding
a sentence. It plays the leading role in organizing the relevant syntactic
elements in a sentence, including subject elements, adverbial elements, etc.
For some languages, such as English, word morphologies are valuable for
identifying predicate heads. However, Chinese offers no morphological
information to indicate words` grammatical roles. A Chinese sentence often
contains several verbal expressions; identifying the expression that plays the
role of the predicate head is not an easy task. Furthermore, Chinese sentences
are inattentive to structure and provide no delimitation between words.
Therefore, identifying Chinese predicate heads involves significant challenges.
In Chinese information extraction, little work has been performed in predicate
head recognition. No generally accepted evaluation dataset supports work in
this important area. This paper presents the first attempt to develop an
annotation guideline for Chinese predicate heads and their relevant syntactic
elements. This annotation guideline emphasizes the role of the predicate as the
structural center of a sentence. The design of relevant syntactic element
annotation also follows this principle. Many considerations are proposed to
achieve this goal, e.g., patterns of predicate heads, a flattened annotation
structure, and a simpler syntactic unit type. Based on the proposed annotation
guideline, more than 1,500 documents were manually annotated. The corpus will
be available online for public access. With this guideline and annotated
corpus, our goal is to broadly impact and advance the research in the area of
Chinese information extraction and to provide the research community with a

coexistence of several Majorana zero modes similar to the Kitaev chain.
However, we confirm that one of zero modes is restricted into a Hilbert
subspace. The mode is regarded as a so-called weak zero mode that should
exhibit thermodynamical properties different from a (strong) zero mode
appearing in the whole Hilbert space. Since the quantum statistics of spin is
the same as a hard-core boson, we expect an experimental realization of the

transient and wave propagation problems is presented. It is constructed from
the Pad\'e expansions of the matrix exponential solution of a system of
first-order ordinary differential equations formulated in the state-space. A
computationally efficient scheme is developed exploiting the techniques of
polynomial factorization and partial fractions of rational functions, and by
decoupling the solution for the displacement and velocity vectors. An important
feature of the novel algorithm is that no direct inversion of the mass matrix
is required. From the diagonal Pad\'e expansion of order $M$ a time-stepping
scheme of order $2M$ is developed. Here, each elevation of the accuracy by two
orders results in an additional system of real or complex sparse equations to
be solved. These systems are comparable in complexity to the standard Newmark
method, i.e., the effective system matrix is a linear combination of the static
stiffness, damping, and mass matrices. It is shown that the second-order scheme
is equivalent to Newmark's constant average acceleration method, often also
referred to as trapezoidal rule. The proposed time integrator has been
implemented in MATLAB using the built-in direct linear equation solvers. In
this article, numerical examples featuring nearly one million degrees of
freedom are presented. High-accuracy and efficiency in comparison with common
second-order time integration schemes are observed. The MATLAB-implementation
is available from the authors upon request or from the GitHub repository (to be

calibration algorithms. Our approach has the benefits of simplifying the
calibration process for practitioners of any calibration expertise level and
providing an objective measure of the quality for our calibration pipeline's

accuracy of the calibration parameters. It involves computing reprojection
errors for the entire scene to ensure that the parameters are well fitted to
all features in the scene. Our proposed calibration pipeline takes 90s, and
obtains an average reprojection error of 1-1.2cm, with standard deviation of
0.4-0.5cm over 46 poses evenly distributed in a scene. This process has been
validated by experimentation on a high resolution, software definable lidar,

evolution in the pool, where the solidification conditions are space-time
variational. To represent the variational solidification conditions in the
pool, the multi-scale simulation is carried out in this paper, combining the
microscopic Phase-Field (PF) equations with the macroscopic thermal processes.
Firstly, two different models, the GR model and TF model, are employed to
simulate the single crystal solidification at a local region of the pool.
Results suggest the TF model is more suitable to reflect the variational
conditions than the GR model. Secondly, the single-crystal solidification and
poly-crystal solidification at the whole region of the pool are performed
through the TF model. The results demonstrate the space-time variabilities of
the solidification conditions across the melt pool. Meanwhile, the variational
conditions affect the microstructure evolution significantly, including the
onset of initial instability at the epitaxial growth stage and the directional
evolutions of the converging grain boundaries (GBs) and diverging GBs at the
competitive growth stage. Moreover, the formation of axial grain structures is
observed, which can be regarded as the competition between the grains along the
axial direction and radial direction. This study indicates the necessity of
considering the variational conditions in a pool. Meanwhile, the PF model can
simulate microstructure evolution under the variational conditions accurately,
which has a great potential for investigating solidification dynamics in the
melt pool.

tracked in a low-dimensional manifold determined in-situ without invoking
laminar flame structures or statistical assumptions about the underlying
turbulent flow. The primary concept in approximate IM (AIM) is that slow
dominant dynamical behavior of the system is confined to a low-dimension
manifold, and fast dynamics respond to the dynamics on the IM instantaneously.
Decomposition of slow/fast dynamics and formulation of an AIM is accomplished
by only exploiting the governing equations. Direct numerical simulations (DNS)
of initially non-premixed fuel-air mixtures developing in forced isotropic
turbulence have been carried out to investigate the proposed model. Reaction
rate parameters are varied to allow for varying levels of extinction and
reignition. The AIM performance in capturing different flame behaviors is
assessed both a priori and a posteriori. It is shown that AIM captures the
dynamics of the flames including extinction and reignition. Moreover, AIM
provides scalar dissipation rate, mixing time for reactive scalars, and
closures for nonlinear terms without any additional modeling. The AIM
formulation is found promising, and provides a new approach to modeling
turbulent combustion.

infinite haploid population with two types (say type $0$ and type $1$) subject
to neutral reproductions, and possibly selection and mutations. In the present
paper we study a Wright-Fisher diffusion in a L\'evy environment that gives a
selective advantage to sometimes one type, sometimes the other. Classical
methods using the Ancestral Selection Graph (ASG) fail in the study of this
model because of the complexity, resulting from the two-sided selection, of the
structure of the information contained in the ASG. We propose a new method that
consists in encoding the relevant combinatorics of the ASG into a function. We
show that the expectations of the coefficients of this function form a
(non-stochastic) semigroup and deduce that they satisfy a linear system of
differential equations. As a result we obtain a series representation for the
fixation probability $h(x)$ (where $x$ is the initial proportion of individuals
of type $0$ in the population) as an infinite sum of polynomials whose
coefficients satisfy explicit linear relations. Our approach then allows to
derive Taylor expansions at every order for $h(x)$ near $x=0$ and to obtain an
explicit recursion formula for the coefficients.

what conditions universal exchange-only computation is possible for qudits
encoded on $d$-state systems for $d>2$. This problem can be posed in terms of
representation theory by recognizing that each quantum mechanical swap,
generated by exchange-interaction, can be identified with a transposition in a
symmetric group, each $d$-state system can be identified with the fundamental
representation of $SU(d)$, and each encoded qudit can be identified with an
irreducible representation of a Lie algebra generated by transpositions.
Towards this end we first give a mathematical definition of exchange-only
universality in terms of a map from the special unitary algebra on the product
of qudits into a representation of a Lie algebra generated by transpositions.
We show that this definition is consistent with quantum computing requirements.
We then proceed with the task of characterizing universal families of qudits,
that is families of encoded qudits admitting exchange-only universality. This
endeavor is aided by the fact that the irreducible representations
corresponding to qudits are canonically labeled by partitions. In particular we
derive necessary and sufficient conditions for universality on one or two such
qudits, in terms of simple arithmetic conditions on the associated partitions.
We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for universality on
arbitrarily many such qudits, in terms of Littlewood--Richardson coefficients.
Among other results, we prove that universal families of multiple qudits are
upward closed, that universality is guaranteed for sufficiently many qudits,
and that any family that is not universal can be made so by simply adding at
most five ancillae. We also obtain results for 2-state systems as a special
case.

  interactions",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates are essential building blocks for a
fault-tolerant quantum computer. While there has been much progress in
suppressing single-qubit gate errors in superconducting qubit systems,
two-qubit gates still suffer from error rates that are orders of magnitude
higher. One limiting factor is the residual ZZ-interaction, which originates
from a coupling between computational states and higher-energy states. While
this interaction is usually viewed as a nuisance, here we experimentally
demonstrate that it can be exploited to produce a universal set of fast single-
and two-qubit entangling gates in a coupled transmon qubit system. To implement
arbitrary single-qubit rotations, we design a new protocol called the two-axis
gate that is based on a three-part composite pulse. It rotates a single qubit
independently of the state of the other qubit despite the strong ZZ-coupling.
We achieve single-qubit gate fidelities as high as 99.1% from randomized
benchmarking measurements. We then demonstrate both a CZ gate and a CNOT gate.
Because the system has a strong ZZ-interaction, a CZ gate can be achieved by
letting the system freely evolve for a gate time $t_g=53.8$ ns. To design the
CNOT gate, we utilize an analytical microwave pulse shape based on the SWIPHT
protocol for realizing fast, low-leakage gates. We obtain fidelities of 94.6%
and 97.8% for the CNOT and CZ gates respectively from quantum progress
tomography.

direction of the array, we find a clog-free uniform liquid state for low
activity, while at higher activity, the density becomes increasingly
heterogeneous and an active clogged state emerges in which the mobility is
strongly reduced. For driving along non-symmetry or incommensurate directions,
there are two different clogging behaviors consisting of a drive dependent
clogged state in the low activity thermal limit and a drive independent clogged
state at high activity. These regimes are separated by a uniform flowing liquid
at intermediate activity. There is a critical activity level above which the
thermal clogged state does not occur, as well as an optimal activity level that
maximizes the disk mobility. Thermal clogged states are dependent on the
driving direction while active clogged states are not. In the low activity
regime, diluting the obstacles produces a monotonic increase in the mobility;
however, for large activities, the mobility is more robust against obstacle
dilution. We also examine the velocity-force curves for driving along
non-symmetry directions, and find that they are linear when the activity is low
or intermediate, but become nonlinear at high activity and show behavior
similar to that found for the plastic depinning of solids. At higher drives the
active clustering is lost. For low activity we also find a reentrant fluid
phase, where the system transitions from a high mobility fluid at low drives to
a clogged state at higher drives and then back into another fluid phase at very
high drives. We map the regions in which the thermally clogged, partially
clogged, active uniform fluid, clustered fluid, active clogged, and
directionally locked states occur as a function of disk density, drift force,

protocols that optimize its usefulness in a given application in areas ranging
from quantum information to computation. Moreover, the resource theories have
transmuted radical quantum phenomena like coherence, nonclassicality and
entanglement from being just intriguing to being helpful in executing realistic
thoughts. A general quantum resource theoretical framework relies on the method
of categorization of all possible quantum states into two sets, namely, the
free set and the resource set. Associated with the set of free states there is
a number of free quantum operations emerging from the natural constraints
attributed to the corresponding physical system. Then, the task of quantum
resource theory is to discover possible aspects arising from the restricted set
of operations as resources. Along with the rapid growth of various resource

minimized or maximized. However, objective functions cannot always be
formulated explicitly in a mathematical form for complicated problem settings.
Although several regression techniques infer the approximate forms of objective
functions, they are at times expensive to evaluate. Optimal points of
""black-box"" objective functions are computed in such scenarios, while
effectively using a small number of clues. Recently, an efficient method by use
of inference by sparse prior for a black-box objective function with binary
variables has been proposed. In this method, a surrogate model was proposed in
the form of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, and
was iteratively solved to obtain the optimal solution of the black-box
objective function. In the present study, we employ the D-Wave 2000Q quantum
annealer, which can solve QUBO by driving the binary variables by quantum
fluctuations. The D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer does not necessarily output the
ground state at the end of the protocol due to freezing effect during the
process. We investigate effects from the output of the D-Wave quantum annealer
in performing black-box optimization. We demonstrate a benchmark test by
employing the sparse Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model as the black-box
objective function, by introducing a parameter controlling the sparseness of
the interaction coefficients. Comparing the results of the D-Wave quantum
annealer to those of the simulated annealing (SA) and semidefinite programming
(SDP), our results by the D-Wave quantum annealer and SA exhibit superiority in
black-box optimization with SDP. On the other hand, we did not find any
advantage of the D-Wave quantum annealer over the simulated annealing. As far
as in our case, any effects by quantum fluctuation are not found.

and well-studied problem is anomaly detection. Anomalies are difficult to
define, yet many algorithms have been proposed. Underlying the approaches is
the nebulous understanding that anomalies are rare, unusual or inconsistent
with the majority of data. The present work provides a philosophical treatise
to clearly define anomalies and develops an algorithm for their efficient
detection with minimal user intervention. Inspired by the Gestalt School of
Psychology and the Helmholtz principle of human perception, anomalies are
assumed to be observations that are unexpected to occur with respect to certain
groupings made by the majority of the data. Under appropriate random variable
modelling anomalies are directly found in a set of data by a uniform and
independent random assumption of the distribution of constituent elements of
the observations, with anomalies corresponding to those observations where the
expectation of the number of occurrences of the elements in a given view is
$<1$. Starting from fundamental principles of human perception an unsupervised
anomaly detection algorithm is developed that is simple, real-time and
parameter-free. Experiments suggest it as a competing choice for univariate
data with promising results on the detection of global anomalies in
multivariate data.

reflect the extent to which abnormal findings deviate from the normal features.
Indeed, physicians often need corresponding images without abnormal findings of
interest or, conversely, images that contain similar abnormal findings
regardless of normal anatomical context. This is called comparative diagnostic
reading of medical images, which is essential for a correct diagnosis. To
support comparative diagnostic reading, content-based image retrieval (CBIR),
which can selectively utilize normal and abnormal features in medical images as
two separable semantic components, will be useful. Therefore, we propose a
neural network architecture to decompose the semantic components of medical
images into two latent codes: normal anatomy code and abnormal anatomy code.
The normal anatomy code represents normal anatomies that should have existed if
the sample is healthy, whereas the abnormal anatomy code attributes to abnormal
changes that reflect deviation from the normal baseline. These latent codes are
discretized through vector quantization to enable binary hashing, which can
reduce the computational burden at the time of similarity search. By
calculating the similarity based on either normal or abnormal anatomy codes or
the combination of the two codes, our algorithm can retrieve images according
to the selected semantic component from a dataset consisting of brain magnetic
resonance images of gliomas. Our CBIR system qualitatively and quantitatively
achieves remarkable results.

Inductive reasoning based feed-forward inference is widely used due to its

PoI should upload its status to a platform, since they are self-interested with
private and possibly time-varying preferences. This paper considers a general
multi-period status acquisition system, aiming to maximize the aggregate social
welfare and ensure the platform freshness. The freshness is measured by a
metric termed age of information. For this goal, we devise a long-term
decomposition (LtD) mechanism to resolve the time-varying information
asymmetry. The key idea is to construct a virtual social welfare that only
depends on the current private information, and then decompose the per-period
operation into multiple distributed bidding problems for the PoIs and
platforms. The LtD mechanism enables the platforms to achieve a tunable
trade-off between payoff maximization and freshness conditions. Moreover, the
LtD mechanism retains the same social performance compared to the benchmark
with symmetric information and asymptotically ensures the platform freshness
conditions. Numerical results based on real-world data show that when the
platforms pay more attention to payoff maximization, each PoI still obtains a
non-negative payoff in the long-term.

Matting to estimate the per-pixel opacity value of the most salient foreground
in an image. To deal with a large amount of semantic diversity in images, a
trimap is conventionally required as it provides important guidance about
object semantics to the matting process. However, creating a good trimap is
often expensive and timeconsuming. The SIM framework simultaneously deals with
the challenge of learning a wide range of semantics and salient object types in
a fully automatic and an end to end manner. Specifically, our framework is able
to produce accurate alpha mattes for a wide range of foreground objects and
cases where the foreground class, such as human, appears in a very different
context than the train data directly from an RGB input. This is done by
employing a salient object detection model to produce a trimap of the most
salient object in the image in order to guide the matting model about
higher-level object semantics. Our framework leverages large amounts of coarse
annotations coupled with a heuristic trimap generation scheme to train the
trimap prediction network so it can produce trimaps for arbitrary foregrounds.
Moreover, we introduce a multi-scale fusion architecture for the task of
matting to better capture finer, low-level opacity semantics. With high-level
guidance provided by the trimap network, our framework requires only a fraction
of expensive matting data as compared to other automatic methods while being
able to produce alpha mattes for a diverse range of inputs. We demonstrate our
framework on a range of diverse images and experimental results show our
framework compares favourably against state of art matting methods without the
need for a trimap

networks (convnets) to generate common features for both domains. In this
paper, we relax the completely-shared convnets assumption adopted by previous
DA methods and propose Domain Conditioned Adaptation Network (DCAN), which
introduces domain conditioned channel attention module with a multi-path
structure to separately excite channel activation for each domain. Such a
partially-shared convnets module allows domain-specialized features in
low-level to be explored appropriately. Further, given the knowledge
transferability varying along with convolutional layers, we develop Generalized
Domain Conditioned Adaptation Network (GDCAN) to automatically determine
whether domain channel activations should be separately modeled in each
attention module. Afterward, the critical domain-specialized knowledge could be
adaptively extracted according to the domain statistic gaps. As far as we know,
this is the first work to explore the domain-wise convolutional channel
activations separately for deep DA networks. Additionally, to effectively match
high-level feature distributions across domains, we consider deploying feature
adaptation blocks after task-specific layers, which can explicitly mitigate the
domain discrepancy.

Convolutional Network (BCNet), where the top GCN layer detects the occluding

We validate the efficacy of bilayer decoupling on both one-stage and two-stage

emerging dynamics in a system of N globally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators

the Hopf bifurcation parameter, favors the macroscopic oscillatory state for
low values of the symmetry breaking coupling and inhomogeneous steady state for
larger values of the coupling. There is also a transition, tipping, to
homogeneous steady state (aging state) from the macroscopic oscillatory state.
The limiting factor in the diffusive coupling favors the macroscopic
oscillatory state even in the presence of a large fraction of inactive

The globally coupled oscillators are reduced to a system of two evolution
equations for the macroscopic order parameters, corresponding to the mean-field
and the shape parameter, using the self-consistent field approach. The
bifurcation diagrams obtained from the mean-field variables elucidate various
bifurcation scenarios responsible for the dynamical transitions observed in N
globally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. In particular, tipping to the aging

the phenomenon of bifurcation induced tipping. Analytical stability (critical)

field with mass $m$, this BEC description amounts to integrating out the field
oscillations over the Hubble time scale $H^{-1}$ in the regime $m \gg H$. We
provide a gauge-invariant general relativistic framework for studying
cosmological perturbations in the presence of a self-interacting BEC associated
with a complex scalar field. In particular, we explicitly show the difference
of BECs from perfect fluids by taking into account cold dark matter, baryons,
and radiation as a Schutz-Sorkin description of perfect fluids. We also
scrutinize the accuracy of commonly used Newtonian treatment based on a
quasi-static approximation for perturbations deep inside the Hubble radius. For
a scalar field which starts to oscillate after matter-radiation equality, we
show that, after the BEC formation, a negative self-coupling hardly leads to a
Laplacian instability of the BEC density contrast. This is attributed to the
fact that the Laplacian instability does not overwhelm the gravitational
instability for self-interactions within the validity of the nonrelativistic
BEC description. Our analysis does not accommodate the regime of parametric
resonance which can potentially occur for a large field alignment during the

existing approaches 1) need OOD data for classifier training or parameter

in-distribution data in a generative manner, which takes their latent features
generated from each hidden layer as a joint distribution across representation
spaces. Since only the in-distribution latent features are comprehensively
understood in representation space, the internal difference between
in-distribution and OOD data can be naturally revealed without the intervention
of any OOD data. Specifically, We construct a generative model, called Latent
Sequential Gaussian Mixture (LSGM), to depict how the in-distribution latent

representation spaces. We first construct the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
based on in-distribution latent features for each hidden layer, and then
connect GMMs via the transition probabilities of the inference traces.
Experimental evaluations on popular benchmark OOD datasets and models validate
the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in OOD

tightening strategy into two parts, depending on the length of the MPC horizon.
For a horizon length of one, the robust MPC problem is solved exactly, whereas
for other horizon lengths, the model uncertainty is over-approximated with a
net-additive component. The resulting MPC controller guarantees robust
satisfaction of state and input constraints in closed-loop with the uncertain

important class of functions in the study of Boolean functions. A function
$f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ is called transitive (or weakly-symmetric) if there
exists a transitive group $G$ of $S_n$ such that $f$ is invariant under the
action of $G$ - that is the function value remains unchanged even after the
bits of the input of $f$ are moved around according to some permutation $\sigma
\in G$. Understanding various complexity measures of transitive functions has
been a rich area of research for the past few decades.
  In this work, we study transitive functions in light of several combinatorial
measures. We look at the maximum separation between various pairs of measures
for transitive functions. Such study for general Boolean functions has been
going on for past many years. The best-known results for general Boolean
functions have been nicely compiled by Aaronson et. al (STOC, 2021).
  The separation between a pair of combinatorial measures is shown by
constructing interesting functions that demonstrate the separation. But many of
the celebrated separation results are via the construction of functions (like
""pointer functions"" from Ambainis et al. (JACM, 2017) and ""cheat-sheet

don't have such separation between the pairs of measures for transitive
functions.

luminescence that can be directly measured. The origins of this optical
activity remain largely unexplored. In this work, using the atomistic
tight-binding method combined with configuration-interaction approach, we
demonstrate that atomic-scale randomness strongly affects oscillator strength
of dark excitons confined in self-assembled cylindrical InGaAs quantum dots
with no need for faceting or shape-elongation. We show that this process is
mediated by two mechanisms: mixing dark and bright configurations by exchange
interaction, and equally important appearance of non-vanishing optical
transition matrix elements that otherwise correspond to nominally forbidden
transitions in a non-alloyed case. The alloy randomness has essential impact on
both bright and dark exciton states, including their energy, emission
intensity, and polarization angle. We conclude that, due to the atomic-scale
alloy randomness, finding dots with desired dark exciton properties may require
exploration of a large ensemble, similarly to how dots with low bright exciton

code differences in syntax, testing the resilience against the changes caused

step for most binary diffing approaches. For example, 47 top-venue papers in
the last 12 years compared different program versions compiled by default
optimization levels (e.g., -Ox in GCC and LLVM). Although many of them claim
they are immune to compiler transformations, it is yet unclear about their
resistance to non-default optimization settings. Especially, we have observed
that adversaries explored non-default compiler settings to amplify malware
differences.
  This paper takes the first step to systematically studying the effectiveness
of compiler optimization on binary code differences. We tailor search-based
iterative compilation for the auto-tuning of binary code differences. We
develop BinTuner to search near-optimal optimization sequences that can
maximize the amount of binary code differences. We run BinTuner with GCC 10.2

Our experiments show that at the cost of 279 to 1,881 compilation iterations,
BinTuner can find custom optimization sequences that are substantially better
than the general -Ox settings. BinTuner's outputs seriously undermine prominent
binary diffing tools' comparisons. In addition, the detection rate of the IoT
malware variants tuned by BinTuner falls by more than 50%. Our findings paint a
cautionary tale for security analysts that attackers have a new way to mutate
malware code cost-effectively, and the research community needs to step back to

constraint $\tilde{\alpha}=(1.2\pm5.2)\times 10^{-17}$, namely
$\alpha=(2.69\pm11.67)\times10^{48}$ eV$^{-2}$, among various observational
limitations from different information channels, which is tighter than previous
bound from the speed of gravitational wave by at least one order of magnitude.
We find that our bound is well supported by the observations of temperature and
lensing potential power spectra of cosmic microwave background from the
Planck-2018 final release. Very interestingly, the large $H_0$ tension between
the local measurement from the Hubble Space Telescope and global derivation
from the Planck-2018 final data under the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM can be
greatly resolved from $4.4\sigma$ to $1.94\sigma$ level in the 4D Gauss-Bonnet

problem and the rescaling Gauss-Bonnet term, which needs the help of the
cosmological constant to explain current cosmic acceleration, is unable to
serve as dark energy alone.

bulk-boundary correspondence (SBBC), an extended version of the conventional
bulk-boundary correspondence to energy-dependent spectral functions, such as
Green's functions, has been proposed in chiral symmetric systems, in which the
chiral operator anticommutes with the Hamiltonian. In this study, we extend the
SBBC to a system with impurity scattering and dynamical self-energies,
regardless of the presence or absence of a gap in the energy spectrum.
Moreover, the SBBC is observed to hold even in a system without chiral

with concrete models, such as superconducting nanowires and a
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Its potential applications and certain remaining

conversation is significant to design human-like conversational agents. During
a conversation, the cognitive state of a speaker often alters due to certain
past utterances, which may lead to a flip in their emotional state. Therefore,
discovering the reasons (triggers) behind the speaker's emotion-flip during a
conversation is essential to explain the emotion labels of individual
utterances. In this paper, along with addressing the task of emotion
recognition in conversations (ERC), we introduce a novel task - Emotion-Flip
Reasoning (EFR), that aims to identify past utterances which have triggered
one's emotional state to flip at a certain time. We propose a masked memory
network to address the former and a Transformer-based network for the latter
task. To this end, we consider MELD, a benchmark emotion recognition dataset in
multi-party conversations for the task of ERC, and augment it with new
ground-truth labels for EFR. An extensive comparison with five state-of-the-art
models suggests improved performances of our models for both tasks. We further
present anecdotal evidence and both qualitative and quantitative error analyses
to support the superiority of our models compared to the baselines.

This allows robots to conduct various tasks. However, it also opens a new door
for cyber attacks: adversaries can leverage these interactions to threaten the
safety of robot operations. Unfortunately, this issue is rarely explored in

  We present the first systematic investigation about the function interactions

by malicious interactions. We introduce a comprehensive graph to model the
function interactions in robot apps by analyzing 3,100 packages from the Robot
Operating System (ROS) platform. From this graph, we identify and categorize
three types of interaction risks. Second, we propose RTron, a novel system to

introduce security policies for each type of risks, and design coordination
nodes to enforce the policies and regulate the interactions. We conduct
extensive experiments on 110 robot apps from the ROS platform and two complex
apps (Baidu Apollo and Autoware) widely adopted in industry. Evaluation results
indicated RTron can correctly identify and mitigate all potential risks with
negligible performance cost. To validate the practicality of the risks and
solutions, we implement and evaluate RTron on a physical UGV (Turtlebot) with

approaches combine clustering-based pseudo-label prediction with representation
learning and perform the two steps in an alternating fashion. However, offline
interaction between these two steps may allow noisy pseudo labels to
substantially hinder the capability of the model. In this paper, we propose a
Group-aware Label Transfer (GLT) algorithm, which enables the online
interaction and mutual promotion of pseudo-label prediction and representation
learning. Specifically, a label transfer algorithm simultaneously uses pseudo
labels to train the data while refining the pseudo labels as an online
clustering algorithm. It treats the online label refinery problem as an optimal
transport problem, which explores the minimum cost for assigning M samples to N
pseudo labels. More importantly, we introduce a group-aware strategy to assign
implicit attribute group IDs to samples. The combination of the online label
refining algorithm and the group-aware strategy can better correct the noisy
pseudo label in an online fashion and narrow down the search space of the

paper, for the first time, we explore the influence of ""dead weights"" which

principle, always beneficial to increase photon number to improve measurement
precision. However, practical constraints prevent arbitrary increase of n due
to the imperfections of a practical detector, especially when the detector
response is dominated by saturation effect. In this work, we show that a
modified weak measurement protocol, namely, biased weak measurement
significantly improves the precision of optical metrology in the presence of
saturation effect. This method detects an ultra-small fraction of photons while
maintains considerable amount of metrological information. The biased
pre-coupling leads to an additional reduction of photons in the post-selection
and generates an extinction point in the spectrum distribution, which is
extremely sensitive to the estimated parameter and difficult to be saturated.
Therefore, the Fisher information can be persistently enhanced by increasing
the photon number. In our magnetic-sensing experiment, biased weak measurement
achieves precision approximately one order of magnitude better than those of
previously used methods. The proposed method can be applied in various optical
measurement schemes to circumvent detector saturation effect with low-cost

the three measurable quantities in $W^{-}$-boson decay (total decay rate,

context of third order finite volume schemes, focusing in particular on the
cells close to the boundaries of the domain. In fact, most techniques known in
the literature rely on the creation of ghost cells outside the boundary and on
some form of extrapolation from the inside that, taking into account the
boundary conditions, fills the ghost cells with appropriate values, so that a
standard reconstruction can be applied also in boundary cells. In (Naumann,
Kolb, Semplice, 2018), motivated by the difficulty of choosing appropriate
boundary conditions at the internal nodes of a network, a different technique
was explored that avoids the use of ghost cells, but instead employs for the
boundary cells a different stencil, biased towards the interior of the domain.
  In this paper, extending that approach, which does not make use of ghost
cells, we propose a more accurate reconstruction for the one-dimensional case
and a two-dimensional one for Cartesian grids. In several numerical tests we
compare the novel reconstruction with the standard approach using ghost cells.

computer simulations indicate not only its quantitative inaccuracies but also
its inability to capture some basic and important aspects of microscopic
polarization response. Here we consider one such shortcoming, a failure to
distinguish the solvation thermodynamics of cations from that of
otherwise-identical anions, and we pursue a simple, physically inspired
modification of the dielectric continuum model to address it. The adaptation is
motivated by analyzing the orientational response of an isolated water molecule
whose dipole is rigidly constrained. Its free energy suggests a Hamiltonian for
dipole fluctuations that accounts implicitly for the influence of higher-order
multipole moments, while respecting constraints of molecular geometry. We
propose a field theory with the suggested form, whose nonlinear response breaks
the charge symmetry of ion solvation. An approximate variational solution of
this theory, with a single adjustable parameter, yields solvation free energies
that agree closely with simulation results over a considerable range of solute

Firstly, the Rayleigh backscattering light of different modes is experimentally
characterized, and it turns out that the waveforms of Phi-OTDR traces of
distinct modes are all different from each other. Thanks to the spatial
difference of fading positions of distinct modes, multiple probes from
spatially multiplexed modes can be used to suppress the interference fading in
Phi-OTDR. Then, the performances of the Phi-OTDR systems using single probe and

shows that both fading probabilities over fiber length and time are reduced
significantly by using multiple SDM probes, which verifies the significant
performance improvement on fading suppression. The proposed novel interference

carbon adatoms only via reconstruction of the carbon bond network. It consists
mainly of 5-, 6- and 7-membered rings and causes a small bottleneck. In
addition, further growth of the initial amorphous patch under electron
irradiation takes place. Two-coordinated atoms are found to play a crucial role
in the latter process, analogous to autocatalisys of rearrangements of rings in
fullerenes. The principal rearrangements in the presence of two-coordinated
atoms can be described as generalized sp-defect migration: a bond is broken
between two three-coordinated atoms and one of them forms a new bond with a
nearby two-coordinated atom. If the new and former two-coordinated atoms are
not bonded, the reaction leads both to displacement of the sp defect and
changes in rings of the sp$^2$ carbon structure. Migration by hopping of
two-coordinated atoms and other reactions involving simultaneous breakage of
two bonds are also detected but much rarely. Long-living two-coordinated atoms
in the patch structure and related fast growth of the patch are observed in

between the non-reciprocal hopping and imaginary gauge field, we propose a
method to construct the topological equivalent models of the non-Hermitian
dimerized lattices with the similarity transformations. The idea of the
constructions is from that the imaginary magnetic flux vanishes under the open
boundary condition and the period boundary spectra can be well approximated by
open boundary spectra. As an illustration, we apply this approach to several
representative non-Hermitian SSH models, efficiently obtaining topological
invariants in analytic form defined in the conventional Bloch bands. The method
gives an alternative way to study the topological properties of non-Hermitian
system.

The X-ray emission is concentrated around the main cluster, while the gas mass

$f_{\mathrm{gas}}=4.0^{+2.3}_{-3.3}\%$, indicating that the subcluster gas was
stripped by ram pressure. X-ray residual image shows three arc-like excess

X-ray morphological center, and the other is close to the X-ray core. The
excess close to the subcluster has a cold-front feature where dense-cold gas

about $\sim 450-650$ kpc, suggesting that the cluster is merged with a non-zero

  First let $G$ be a connected semisimple Lie group with finite center of real

work well for mean differences in biomarkers between cases and controls.
Biological processes are however much more heterogeneous, and differences could
also occur in other distributional characteristics (e.g. variances, skewness).
Many machine learning techniques are better capable of utilizing these higher
order distributional differences, sometimes at cost of explainability.
  In this study we propose quantile based prediction (QBP), a binary
classification method that is based on the selection of multiple continuous
biomarkers. QBP generates a single score using the tails of the biomarker
distributions for cases and controls. This single score can then be evaluated
by ROC analysis to investigate its predictive power.
  The performance of QBP is compared to supervised learning methods using
extensive simulation studies, and two case studies: major depression disorder
and trisomy. Simultaneously, the classification performance of the existing
techniques in relation to each other is assessed. The key strengths of QBP are
the opportunity to select relevant biomarkers and the outstanding
classification performance in the case biomarkers predominantly show variance
differences between cases and controls. When only shifts in means were present
in the biomarkers, QBP obtained an inferior performance. Lastly, QBP proved to
be unbiased in case of absence of disease relevant biomarkers and outperformed
the other methods on the MDD case study.
  More research is needed to further optimize QBP, since it has several
opportunities to improve its performance. Here we wanted to introduce the

at finite temperature with path integral Monte Carlo and at T=0 K with
variational path integral. From both methods we find that the lowest energy
state of He-4 on GF is a superfluid. Due to the very large corrugation of the
adsorption potential this superfluid has a very strong spatial anisotropy, the
ratio between the largest and smallest areal density being about 6, the
superfluid fraction at the lowest T is about 55%, and the temperature of the
transition to the normal state is in the range 0.5-1 K. Thus, GF offers a
platform for studying the properties of a strongly interacting highly
anisotropic bosonic superfluid. At a larger coverage He-4 has a transition to
an ordered commensurate state with occupation of 1/6 of the adsorption sites.
This phase is stable up to a transition temperature located between 0.5 and
1~K. The system has a triangular order similar to that of He-4 on graphite. The
lowest energy state of He-4 on hBN is an ordered commensurate state with
occupation of 1/3 of the adsorption sites and triangular symmetry. A disordered
state is present at lower coverage as a metastable state. In the presence of an
electric field the corrugation of the adsorption potential is slightly
increased but up to a magnitude of 1 V/Ang. the effect is small and does not

uneven terrains, unstructured class boundaries, irregular features and strong
textures. These aspects affect the perception of the vehicle from which the
information is used for path planning. Current off-road datasets exhibit
difficulties like class imbalance and understanding of varying environmental
topography. To overcome these issues we propose a framework for off-road
semantic segmentation called as OFFSEG that involves (i) a pooled class
semantic segmentation with four classes (sky, traversable region,
non-traversable region and obstacle) using state-of-the-art deep learning
architectures (ii) a colour segmentation methodology to segment out specific
sub-classes (grass, puddle, dirt, gravel, etc.) from the traversable region for
better scene understanding. The evaluation of the framework is carried out on
two off-road driving datasets, namely, RELLIS-3D and RUGD. We have also tested
proposed framework in IISERB campus frames. The results show that OFFSEG
achieves good performance and also provides detailed information on the
traversable region.

representation for making financial time series more suitable for machine

performs better on the liquid markets, and iv) whether SHAP feature
interactions are reliable to be used in the considered setting. Our analysis
shows that the proposed volume-based method allows successful classification of
the financial time series patterns, and also leads to better classification
performance than the price levels-based method, excelling specifically on more
liquid financial instruments. Finally, we propose an approach for obtaining
feature interactions directly from tree-based models and compare the outcomes

crucially on the `hairs', as well as on the nature of the compact object. It
turns out that the presence of extra dimension affects both these properties,
by incorporating an extra tidal charge for braneworld black holes and also by
introducing quantum effects, leading to possible existence of exotic compact
objects. It turns out that the phasing information from tidal heating in the

analyse the time series of MODIS imagery by estimating spatially resolved maps
of lake ice for these Alpine lakes with supervised machine learning. To train
the classifier we rely on reference data annotated manually based on webcam
images. From the ice maps, we derive long-term LIP trends. Since the webcam
data are only available for two winters, we cross-check our results against the
operational MODIS and VIIRS snow products. We find a change in complete freeze
duration of -0.76 and -0.89 days per annum for lakes Sils and Silvaplana,
respectively. Furthermore, we observe plausible correlations of the LIP trends
with climate data measured at nearby meteorological stations. We notice that
mean winter air temperature has a negative correlation with the freeze duration
and break-up events and a positive correlation with the freeze-up events.
Additionally, we observe a strong negative correlation of sunshine during the
winter months with the freeze duration and break-up events.

visual data are available at training time) can be predicted by leveraging
their class embeddings (e.g., a list of attributes describing them) together
with a complementary pool of seen classes (paired with both visual data and
class embeddings). Despite GZSL is arguably challenging, we posit that knowing
in advance the class embeddings, especially for unseen categories, is an actual
limit of the applicability of GZSL towards real-world scenarios. To relax this
assumption, we propose Open Zero-Shot Learning (OZSL) to extend GZSL towards
the open-world settings. We formalize OZSL as the problem of recognizing seen
and unseen classes (as in GZSL) while also rejecting instances from unknown
categories, for which neither visual data nor class embeddings are provided. We
formalize the OZSL problem introducing evaluation protocols, error metrics and
benchmark datasets. We also suggest to tackle the OZSL problem by proposing the
idea of performing unknown feature generation (instead of only unseen features
generation as done in GZSL). We achieve this by optimizing a generative process
to sample unknown class embeddings as complementary to the seen and the unseen.
We intend these results to be the ground to foster future research, extending
the standard closed-world zero-shot learning (GZSL) with the novel open-world
counterpart (OZSL).

the data of the S2 star orbiting the Sgr A* to determine and analyze the

we consider a geometrically-thick accretion disk model around the Sgr A* BH and
demonstrate that the effect of DM distribution on the shadow radius and the

significant only when the DM density is of the order $\rho_\text{sp} \sim

of fast rotation. We compute the gravitational wave emission from proto-neutron
star convection and its associated dynamo, by post-processing three-dimensional
MHD simulations of a model restricted to the convective zone in the anelastic
approximation. We consider two different proto-neutron star structures
representative of early times (with a convective layer) and late times (when
the star is almost entirely convective). In the slow rotation regime, the
gravitational wave emission follows a broad spectrum peaking at about three
times the turnover frequency. In this regime, the inclusion of magnetic fields
slightly decreases the amplitude without changing the spectrum significantly
compared to a non-magnetised simulation. Fast rotation changes both the
amplitude and spectrum dramatically. The amplitude is increased by a factor of
up to a few thousands. The spectrum is characterized by several peaks
associated to inertial modes, whose frequency scales with the rotation
frequency. Using simple physical arguments, we derive scalings that reproduce
quantitatively several aspects of these numerical results. We also observe an
excess of low-frequency gravitational waves, which appears at the transition to
a strong field dynamo characterized by a strong axisymmetric toroidal magnetic
field. This signature of dynamo action could be used to constrain the dynamo
efficiency in a proto-neutron star with future gravitational wave detections.

processes, notably accretion and ejection of material. Critical to correctly
describe the conditions of planet formation, these processes are best probed

high-resolution spectra to investigate the kinematics of the emitting gas, and
UV-to-NIR X-Shooter medium-resolution flux-calibrated spectra to provide the
fundamental parameters that HST data alone cannot provide, such as extinction
and stellar properties. The data obtained by PENELLOPE have no proprietary
time, and the fully reduced spectra are made available to the whole community.
Here, we describe the data and the first scientific analysis of the accretion
properties for the sample of thirteen targets located in the Orion OB1
association and in the sigma-Orionis cluster, observed in Nov-Dec 2020. We find
that the accretion rates are in line with those observed previously in
similarly young star-forming regions, with a variability on a timescale of days
of <3. The comparison of the fits to the continuum excess emission obtained
with a slab model on the X-Shooter spectra and the HST/STIS spectra shows a
shortcoming in the X-Shooter estimates of <10%, well within the assumed
uncertainty. Its origin can be either a wrong UV extinction curve or due to the
simplicity of this modelling, and will be investigated in the course of the
PENELLOPE program. The combined ULLYSES and PENELLOPE data will be key for a
better understanding of the accretion/ejection mechanisms in young stars.

that debugging support is particularly valuable for memory and concurrency

find general formulas in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions, extending
exact results known in literature and finding new ones for the case of

put in direct connection with the boundary conditions. We then show that, for

nominal operation, the plant efficiency is determined by the thermodynamic
efficiency and the recirculated power fraction. However, on average the reactor
operates below the nominal power, even when the long shutdown periods for large
maintenance are left outside the averaging. Hence, next to the recirculated
power fraction, the capacity factor must be factored in. An expression for the
plant efficiency which incorporates both factors is given. It is shown that the
combination of high recirculated power fraction and a low capacity factor
results in poor plant efficiency. This is due to the fact that in a fusion
reactor the recirculated power remains high if it runs at reduced output power.
It is argued that, at least for a first generation of power plants, this
combination is likely to occur. Worked out example calculations are given for
the models of the Power Plant Conceptual Study. Finally, the impact on the
competitiveness of fusion on the energy market is discussed. This analysis
stresses the importance of the development of plant designs with low
recirculated power fraction.

dissipative coupling, the even parity multi-mode cat state can be
deterministically prepared from the vacuum. Remarkably, engineered two-photon
loss gives rise to a fast relaxation towards the steady state, protecting the
state preparation against decoherence due to intrinsic single-photon losses and
imperfections in tailored dissipative coupling, which sets in at longer times.
The relaxation time is independent of system size making the state preparation
scalable. Multi-mode cat states are naturally endowed with a noise bias that

coefficients of a hot and deconfined plasma of quarks and gluons, created post
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions in the presence of a weak, homogeneous
background magnetic field. We employ the kinetic theory framework, wherein we
use the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time
approximation. In-medium interactions are taken into account via the
quasiparticle masses of the partons extracted from one loop perturbative
thermal QCD. We calculate the individual and total Seebeck coefficients in 2
different approaches (1-D and 2-D formulations). In the 1-D analysis, we find
that a larger current quark mass has an amplifying effect on the individual
Seebeck coefficient in the presence of a weak magnetic field. The temperature
sensitivities of the individual Seebeck coefficients increase with increase in
the current mass of the quark species in the case of a weak magnetic field
whereas the same records a decreasing trend in the presence of a strong
magnetic field. The variation of individual and total Seebeck coefficients with
temperature, chemical potential and background magnetic field are found to
follow similar trends in both the approaches, viz. decrease in magnitude with
increasing temperature and increase in magnitude with increase in chemical
potential and magnetic field. We also calculate the individual and total Nernst
coefficients (in 2-D formulation) which are found to decrease with both
temperature and chemical potential and increase with the magnetic field.
Further, we find that the sign of the Nernst coefficient is independent of the
electric charge of the charge carrier of the medium.

  scattering problems through Gaussian process regression",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with the design of a non-intrusive model order
reduction (MOR) for the system of parametric time-domain Maxwell equations. A
time- and parameter-independent reduced basis (RB) is constructed by using a
two-step proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique from a collection of
full-order electromagnetic field solutions, which are generated via a
discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) solver. The mapping between the
time/parameter values and the projection coefficients onto the RB space is
approximated by a Gaussian process regression (GPR). Based on the data
characteristics of electromagnetic field solutions, the singular value
decomposition (SVD) is applied to extract the principal components of the
training data of each projection coefficient, and the GPR models are trained
for time- and parameter-modes respectively, by which the final global
regression function can be represented as a linear combination of these time-
and parameter-Gaussian processes. The extraction of the RB and the training of
GPR surrogate models are both completed in the offline stage. Then the field
solution at any new input time/parameter point can be directly recovered in the
online stage as a linear combination of the RB with the regression outputs as
the coefficients. In virtue of its non-intrusive nature, the proposed POD-GPR
framework, which is equation-free, decouples the offline and online stages
completely, and hence can predict the electromagnetic solution fields at unseen
parameter locations quickly and effectively. The performance of our method is
illustrated by a scattering problem of a multi-layer dielectric cylinder.

out under the assumption that the gradient describing the sensitivity of the

gradient-based optimization methods, which efficiently steer the optimization
towards a local optimum, gradient estimation methods can be employed. However,
many simulation runs are needed to obtain accurate estimates if the input
dimension is large. Automatic differentiation (AD) is a family of techniques to
compute gradients of general programs directly. Here, we explore the use of AD
in the context of time-driven agent-based simulations. By substituting common
discrete model elements such as conditional branching with smooth
approximations, we obtain gradient information across discontinuities in the
model logic. On the example of microscopic traffic models and an epidemics
model, we study the fidelity and overhead of the differentiable models, as well
as the convergence speed and solution quality achieved by gradient-based
optimization compared to gradient-free methods. In traffic signal timing
optimization problems with high input dimension, the gradient-based methods
exhibit substantially superior performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the
approach enables gradient-based training of neural network-controlled
simulation entities embedded in the model logic.

suggests that one of the asteroids formerly thought to be retrograde-rotating,
208~Lacrimosa, in reality exhibits prograde rotation, yet other properties of

whether the new spin solution of Lacrimosa invalidates the previously proposed
model of the Koronis large members or simply reveals more possibilities for the
long-term evolutionary paths, including some that have not yet been explored.
We confirm and substantiate the previously suggested prograde rotation of
Lacrimosa. Its spin vector has an ecliptic longitude and latitude of
$(\lambda,\beta)=(15^\circ \pm 2^\circ, 67^\circ\pm 2^\circ)$ and a sidereal
rotation period $P=14.085734\pm 0.000007$ hr. The thermal and occultation data
allow us to calibrate a volume equivalent size of $D=44\pm 2$ km of Lacrimosa.
The observations also constrain the shape model relatively well. Assuming
uniform density, the dynamical ellipticity is $\Delta=0.35\pm 0.05$. Unlike
other large prograde-rotating Koronis members, Lacrimosa spin is not captured
in the Slivan state. We propose that Lacrimosa differed from this group in that
it had initially slightly larger obliquity and longer rotation period. With
those parameters, it jumped over the Slivan state instead of being captured and
slowly evolved into the present spin configuration. In the future, it is likely
to be captured in the Slivan state corresponding to the proper (instead of
forced) mode of the orbital plane precession in the inertial space.

injectives, thus defined extensions agree with the ones defined earlier via
projective or injective resolutions. For categories with enough projective or
enough injective morphisms, we prove that these are right derived functors of
the $\operatorname{Hom}$-bifunctor in either argument.
  Since $\operatorname{Hom}$ is only half-exact in each argument, it is natural
to expect ""negative extensions"", i.e. its left derived functors, to exist and
not necessarily vanish. We define negative extensions with respect to the first
and to the second argument and show that they give rise to universal
$\delta$-functors, when there are enough projective or injective morphisms,
respectively. In general, they are not balanced. However, for topological
extriangulated categories, the existence of a balanced version of negative
extensions follows from combining the work of Klemenc on exact
$\infty$-categories with results of the second and third authors. We discuss
various criteria under which one has the balance of the above bifunctors on the
functorial or on the numerical levels. This happens, in particular, in the
cases of exact or triangulated categories, and also in the case of the category
of $n$-term complexes with projective components over a finite-dimensional

  Given a connected sequence of functors on an extriangulated category

rotation evolution, arising from the extensively studied effect of spin-orbit
coupling as well as more nuanced dynamics arising from spin-spin interactions.
The ability of an object to sustain an aspheroidal shape largely determines
whether or not it will exhibit non-trivial rotational behavior. In this work,
we adopt a simplified model of a gravitationally interacting primary and
satellite pair, where each body's quadrupole moment is approximated by two
diametrically opposed point masses. After calculating the net gravitational
torque on the satellite from the primary, and the associated equations of
motion, we employ a Hamiltonian formalism which allows for a perturbative
treatment of the spin-orbit and retrograde and prograde spin-spin coupling
states. By analyzing the resonances individually and collectively, we determine
the criteria for resonance overlap and the onset of chaos, as a function of
orbital and geometric properties of the binary. We extend the 2D planar
geometry to calculate the obliquity evolution, and find that satellites in
spin-spin resonances undergo precession when inclined out of the plane, but do
not tumble. We apply our resonance overlap criteria to the contact binary
system (216) Kleopatra, and find that its satellites, Cleoselene and
Alexhelios, may plausibly be exhibiting chaotic rotational dynamics from the
overlap of the spin-orbit and retrograde spin-spin resonances. While this model
is by construction generalizable to any binary system, it will be particularly
useful to study small bodies in the solar system, whose irregular shapes make
them ideal candidates for exotic rotational states.

measured at 18 c.m. energies where the best precision is 8.1\% at

under the assumption $|G_{E}|=|G_{M}|$. Our results improve the statistical
precision on the neutron form factor by more than a factor of 60 over previous
measurements from the FENICE and DM2 experiments and usher in a new era where
neutron form factor data from annihilation in the time-like regime is on par

technology raises new open issues that whether it is possible to generate fake

to develop digital image watermark fakers by using generative adversarial

train a watermark faker with U-Net as the backbone, whose input is an original

Although a recent method RECT has shown promising performance, its working
mechanisms are not clear and still needs lots of training data. In this paper,
we give deep insights into RECT, and address its fundamental limits. We show
that its core part is a GNN prototypical model in which a class prototype is
described by its mean feature vector. As such, RECT maps nodes from the
raw-input feature space into an intermediate-level semantic space that connects
the raw-input features to both seen and unseen classes. This mechanism makes
RECT work well on both seen and unseen classes, which however also reduces the
discrimination. To realize its full potentials, we propose two label expansion
strategies. Specifically, besides expanding the labeled node set of seen
classes, we can also expand that of unseen classes. Experiments on real-world
datasets validate the superiority of our methods.

Accepted for publication in Radio Science",,"10.1029/2020RS007171",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In radio astronomy, holography is a commonly used technique to create an
image of the electric field distribution in the aperture of a dish antenna. The
image is used to detect imperfections in the reflector surface. Similarly,
holography can be applied to phased array telescopes, in order to measure the
complex gains of the receive paths of individual antennas. In this paper, a
holographic technique is suggested to calibrate the digital beamformer of a
phased array telescope. The effectiveness of the technique was demonstrated by
applying it on data from the Engineering Development Array 2, one of the
prototype stations of the low frequency component of the Square Kilometre
Array. The calibration method is very quick and requires few resources. In
contrast to holography for dish antennas, it works without a reference antenna.
We demonstrate the utility of this technique for initial station commissioning
and verification as well as for routine station calibration.

we have carried out an in-depth characterization of the nanoparticles as a
function of APTES content. Surface charge and nanoparticles morphology were
strongly influenced by the amount of APTES and particles changed from hexagonal
to bean-like morphology insofar APTES increased. Besides, the porous structure
was also affected, showing a contraction of the lattice parameter and pore
size, while increasing the wall thickness. These results bring about new
insights about the nanoparticles formation during the co-condensation process.
The model proposed herein considers that different interactions stablished
between TEOS and APTES with the structure directing agent have consequences on
pore size, wall thickness and particle morphology. Finally, APTES is an
excellent linker to covalently attach active targeting agents such as folate
groups. We have hypothesized that APTES could also play a role in the
biological behavior of the nanoparticles. So, the internalization efficiency of
the nanoparticles has been tested with cancerous LNCaP and non-cancerous
preosteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. The results indicate a cooperative effect
between aminopropylsilane presence and folic acid, only for the cancerous LNCaP

contextual information from images as well as 3D object-level information.
Unlike existing stereo matching methods that exclusively focus on the
pixel-level correspondence between stereo images within a volumetric space
(i.e., cost volume), we exploit this volumetric structure in a different
manner. The cost volume explicitly encompasses 3D information along its
disparity axis, therefore it is a privileged structure that can encapsulate the
3D contextual information from objects. However, it is not straightforward
since the disparity values map the 3D metric space in a non-linear fashion.
Thus, we present two novel strategies to handle 3D objectness in the cost
volume space: selective sampling (RoISelect) and 2D-3D fusion
(fusion-by-occupancy), which allow us to seamlessly incorporate 3D object-level
information and achieve accurate depth performance near the object boundary
regions. Our depth estimation achieves competitive performance in the KITTI

network with correlated weights. Signals become highly correlated in deep ReLU
networks with uncorrelated weights. We show that ReLU networks with
anti-correlated weights can avoid this fate and have a chaotic phase where the
signal correlations saturate below unity. Consistent with this analysis, we
find that networks initialized with anti-correlated weights can train faster
(in a teacher-student setting) by taking advantage of the increased
expressivity in the chaotic phase. Combining this with a previously proposed
strategy of using an asymmetric initialization to reduce dead node probability,
we propose an initialization scheme that allows faster training and learning
than the best-known initializations.

that (i) The expectation value of a generic odd operator approaches zero in the

monochalcogenides (MX, with M = Ge, Sn and X = S, Se). Upon interlayer sliding
over an in-plane unit cell length, the top layer exhibits a reversible
intralayer ferroelectric switching, leading to a reversible transition between
the ferroelectric (electric polarization of 40$\mu$C/cm$^2$) and
antiferroelectric states in the bilayer MXs. Our results show that the
interlayer van der Waals interaction, which is usually considered to be weak,
can actually generate an in-plane lattice distortion and thus cause the
breaking/forming of intralayer covalent bonds in the top layer, leading to the
observed tribo-ferroelectricity phenomenon. This unique property has several
advantages for energy harvesting over existing piezoelectric and triboelectric
nanogenerators. The interlayer sliding-induced polarization change is as high
as 40$\mu$C/cm$^2$, which can generate an open-circuit voltage two orders of
magnitude higher than that of MoS$_2$-based nanogenerators. The polarization
change occurs over a time period for interlayer sliding over a unit-cell

show that the detonation propagation speed and detonation structures are
significantly affected by the preevaporated gas equivalence ratio. The
numerical soot foils are used to characterize the influence of preevaporated
gas equivalence ratio on the detonation propagation. Regular detonation

ratios, but when decreasing the preevaporated gas equivalence ratio, the
detonation cellular structures become much more unstable and the average cell
width also increases. It is also found that the preevaporated gas equivalence

unexplored in spite of the large number of layered oxide structures amenable to
exfoliation. There is an increasing interest in ultra-thin film oxide
nanostructures from applied points of view. In this perspective paper, recent
progress in understanding the fundamental properties of 2D oxides is discussed.
Two families of 2D oxides are considered: (1) van der Waals bonded layered
materials in which the transition metal is in its highest valence state
(represented by V$_2$O$_5$ and MoO$_3$) and (2) layered materials with ionic
bonding between positive alkali cation layers and negatively charged transition
metal oxide layers (LiCoO$_2$). The chemical exfoliation process and its
combinaton with mechanical exfoliation are presented for the latter. Structural
phase stability of the resulting nanoflakes, the role of cation size and the
importance of defects in oxides are discussed. Effects of two-dimensionality on
phonons, electronic band structures and electronic screening are placed in the
context of what is known on other 2D materials, such as transition metal
dichalcogenides. Electronic structure is discussed at the level of
many-body-perturbation theory using the quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$
method, the accuracy of which is critically evaluated including effects of
electron-hole interactions on screening and electron-phonon coupling. The
predicted occurence of a two-dimensional electron gas on Li covered surfaces of
LiCoO$_2$ and its relation to topological aspects of the band structure and
bonding is presented as an example of the essential role of the surface in
ultrathin materials. Finally, some case studies of the electronic transport and
the use of these oxides in nanoscale field effect transistors are presented.

preferences drift quite abruptly (short-term preferences), while others change
over a longer period of time (long-term preferences). Although the existing
news recommender systems consider the reader's full history, they often ignore
the dynamics in the reader's behavior. Thus, they cannot meet the demand of the
news readers for their time-varying preferences. In addition, the
state-of-the-art news recommendation models are often focused on providing
accurate predictions, which can work well in traditional recommendation
scenarios. However, in a news recommender system, diversity is essential, not
only to keep news readers engaged, but also to play a key role in a democratic
society. In this PhD dissertation, our goal is to build a news recommender
system to address these two challenges. Our system should be able to: (i)
accommodate the dynamics in reader behavior; and (ii) consider both accuracy
and diversity in the design of the recommendation model. Our news recommender
system can also work for unprofiled, anonymous and short-term readers, by
leveraging the rich side information of the news items and by including the
implicit feedback in our model. We evaluate our model with multiple evaluation
measures (both accuracy and diversity-oriented metrics) to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods.

do not always give the same results. Our purpose is to compare them from the
analytical point of view of functions. We do that by studying generalizations

related to some classical problems in Fourier analysis. The conclusion is that
the result strongly depends on regularity. To visualize this, we establish an
analogy between these generalizations and the influence of viscosity in
turbulent flows. This article is motivated by the mathematical works on the
multifractal formalism and the discovery of Riemann's non-differentiable

  Results are consistent with a significant light-mass fraction, at best fit

confirms earlier results from LOFAR, with systematic uncertainties on $X_{\rm

of short-duration bursts from J1846-0258 was accompanied by an enhancement of
X-ray persistent flux and significant spectral softening, similar to those
observed during its first bursting episode in 2006. The 2020 pulsar spectrum is
described by a powerlaw model with a photon index Gamma=1.7\pm0.3 in comparison
to a Gamma=1.2\pm0.1 before outburst and shows evidence of an emerging thermal
component with blackbody temperature kT=0.7\pm0.1 keV. The 0.5--10 keV
unabsorbed flux increased from 5.4e-12 erg/cm^2/s in quiescence to 1.3e-11
erg/cm^2/s following the outburst. We did not detect any radio emission from
the pulsar at 2 GHz and place an upper limit of 7.1 uJy and 55 mJy for the
coherent pulsed emission and single-pulses, respectively. The 2020 PWN
spectrum, characterized by a photon index of 1.92\pm0.04 and X-ray luminosity
of 1.2e-35 erg/s at a distance of 5.8~kpc, is consistent with those observed
before the outburst. An analysis of regions closer to the pulsar shows
small-scale time variabilities and brightness changes over the 20-yr period
from 2000 to 2020, while the photon indices did not change. We conclude that
the outburst in PSR J1846-0258 is a combination of crustal and magnetospheric

provide guaranteed safety across variety of circumstances that an uncertain
system might encounter. To guarantee performance while assuring satisfaction of
safety constraints across variety of circumstances, an assured autonomous
control framework is presented in this paper by empowering RL algorithms with
metacognitive learning capabilities. More specifically, adapting the reward
function parameters of the RL agent is performed in a metacognitive
decision-making layer to assure the feasibility of RL agent. That is, to assure
that the learned policy by the RL agent satisfies safety constraints specified
by signal temporal logic while achieving as much performance as possible. The
metacognitive layer monitors any possible future safety violation under the
actions of the RL agent and employs a higher-layer Bayesian RL algorithm to
proactively adapt the reward function for the lower-layer RL agent. To minimize
the higher-layer Bayesian RL intervention, a fitness function is leveraged by
the metacognitive layer as a metric to evaluate success of the lower-layer RL
agent in satisfaction of safety and liveness specifications, and the
higher-layer Bayesian RL intervenes only if there is a risk of lower-layer RL
failure. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

fluctuations in magnetically confined plasmas often exhibit multiple
simultaneous chirps. While the superposition of oscillations at multiple
frequencies necessarily causes beating in the signal acquired by a localized
external probe, self-consistent hybrid simulations of chirping EP modes in a
JT-60U tokamak plasma have demonstrated the possibility of global beating,
where the electromagnetic field vanishes globally between beats and reappears
with opposite phase. This implies that there can be a single field mode that
oscillates at multiple frequencies simultaneously when resonantly driven by
multiple density waves in EP phase space. Conversely, this means that the EP
density waves are mutually coupled and interfere with each other via the
jointly driven field, a mechanism ignored in some theories. In this treatise,
we study the role of field pulsations in general and beating in particular
using the Hamiltonian guiding center orbit-following code ORBIT with a reduced
wave-particle interaction model in realistic geometry. Through amplitude
pulsations and phase jumps, beating is found to drive the evolution of EP phase
space structures. Observations: (1) Beating causes density wave fronts to
advance radially in pulses. The resulting chirps become staircase-like. (2) The
beats facilitate convective transfer of material between neighboring layers of
phase space density waves. On the one hand, this may delay detachment of
solitary vortices. On the other hand, it facilitates the accumulation of hole
and clump fragments into larger structures. (3) Long-range chirping occurs when
massive holes or clumps detach and drift away from the turbulent belt around
the seed resonance. The detached vortices can remain robust and, on average,
maintain their concentric nested layers while being perturbed by the field's
continued beating.

  https://github.com/BIT-DA/TSA",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain adaptation has been widely explored by transferring the knowledge from
a label-rich source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. Most
existing domain adaptation algorithms attend to adapting feature
representations across two domains with the guidance of a shared
source-supervised classifier. However, such classifier limits the
generalization ability towards unlabeled target recognition. To remedy this, we
propose a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) approach to enhance the
classifier adaptation ability through implicitly generating source features
towards target semantics. Specifically, TSA is inspired by the fact that deep
feature transformation towards a certain direction can be represented as
meaningful semantic altering in the original input space. Thus, source features
can be augmented to effectively equip with target semantics to train a more
transferable classifier. To achieve this, for each class, we first use the
inter-domain feature mean difference and target intra-class feature covariance
to construct a multivariate normal distribution. Then we augment source
features with random directions sampled from the distribution class-wisely.
Interestingly, such source augmentation is implicitly implemented through an
expected transferable cross-entropy loss over the augmented source
distribution, where an upper bound of the expected loss is derived and
minimized, introducing negligible computational overhead. As a light-weight and
general technique, TSA can be easily plugged into various domain adaptation
methods, bringing remarkable improvements. Comprehensive experiments on
cross-domain benchmarks validate the efficacy of TSA.

phonon bath. With a small and constant inhomogeneity in the coupling, the
excitation relaxation rates are obtained in closed form. They are dominated by
transitions between exciton modes lying next to each other in the energy
spectrum. The rates are quadratic in the number of sites in a long chain.
Consequently, the evolution of site occupation numbers exhibits longer
coherence lifetime for short chains only. When external source and sink are
added, the rate equations of exciton occupation numbers are similar to those
obtained earlier by Fr\""{o}hlich to explain energy storage and energy transfer
in biological systems. There is a clear separation of time scale into a faster
one pertaining to internal influence of the chain and phonon bath, and a slower
one determined by external influence, such as the pumping rate of the source,
the absorption rate of the sink and the rate of radiation loss. The energy
transfer efficiency at steady state depends strongly on these external
parameters, and is robust against a change in the internal parameters, such as
temperature and inhomogeneity. Excitations are predicted to concentrate to the
lowest energy mode when the source power is sufficiently high. In the site
basis, this implies that when sustained by a high power source, a sink
positioned at the center of the chain is more efficient in trapping energy than
a sink placed at its end. Analytic expressions of energy transfer efficiency
are obtained in the high power and low power source limit. Parameters of a
photosynthetic system are used as examples to illustrate the results.

approach, is that they can be interpretable, allowing for novel insights to be
gained from the data. However, without a proper way of measuring
interpretability, the evaluation of novel contributions is difficult and it
becomes practically impossible to devise techniques that directly optimize this
property. In this work, an information-theoretic measure (entropy) is proposed
for interpretability of MHMMs, and based on that, a novel approach to improve
model interpretability is proposed, i.e., an entropy-regularized Expectation
Maximization (EM) algorithm. The new approach aims for reducing the entropy of
the Markov chains (involving state transition matrices) within an MHMM, i.e.,
assigning higher weights to common state transitions during clustering. It is
argued that this entropy reduction, in general, leads to improved
interpretability since the most influential and important state transitions of
the clusters can be more easily identified. An empirical investigation shows
that it is possible to improve the interpretability of MHMMs, as measured by
entropy, without sacrificing (but rather improving) clustering performance and
computational costs, as measured by the v-measure and number of EM iterations,

several majority classes have a significantly larger number of samples than the
remaining minority classes. This imbalance degrades the performance of typical
supervised learning algorithms designed for balanced training sets. In this
paper, we address this issue by augmenting minority classes with a recently
proposed implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA) algorithm, which produces
diversified augmented samples by translating deep features along many
semantically meaningful directions. Importantly, given that ISDA estimates the
class-conditional statistics to obtain semantic directions, we find it
ineffective to do this on minority classes due to the insufficient training
data. To this end, we propose a novel approach to learn transformed semantic
directions with meta-learning automatically. In specific, the augmentation
strategy during training is dynamically optimized, aiming to minimize the loss
on a small balanced validation set, which is approximated via a meta update
step. Extensive empirical results on CIFAR-LT-10/100, ImageNet-LT, and
iNaturalist 2017/2018 validate the effectiveness of our method.

  System for Contouring Motion Tasks","11 pages, 8 figures",,"10.1109/TMECH.2021.3096601",,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a global iterative sliding mode control approach for
high-precision contouring tasks of a flexure-linked biaxial gantry system. For
such high-precision contouring tasks, it is the typical situation that the
involved multi-axis cooperation is one of the most challenging problems. As
also would be inevitably encountered, various factors render the multi-axis
cooperation rather difficult; such as the strong coupling (which naturally
brings nonlinearity) between different axes due to its mechanical structure,
the backlash and deadzone caused by the friction, and the difficulties in
system identification, etc. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, this work
investigates an intelligent model-free contouring control method for such a
multi-axis motion stage. Essentially in the methodology developed here, it is
firstly ensured that all the coupling, friction, nonlinearity, and disturbance
(regarded as uncertain dynamics in each axis) are suitably posed as
`uncertainties'. Then, a varying-gain sliding mode control method is proposed
to adaptively compensate for the matched unknown dynamics in the time domain,
while an iterative learning law is applied to suppress the undesirable effects
(arising from the repetitive matched and unmatched uncertainties in the
iteration domain). With this approach, the chattering that typically results
from the overestimated control gains in the sliding mode control is thus
suppressed during the iterations. To analyze the contouring performance and
show the improved outcomes, rigorous proof is furnished on both the stability
in the time domain and the convergence in the iteration domain; and the
real-time experiments also illustrate that the requirements of precision motion
control towards high-speed and complex-curvature references can be satisfied
using the proposed method, without prior knowledge of the boundary to the
unknown dynamics.

  intervals","15 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.OT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Introduction: there is an ongoing debate about directional inference of
two-sided hypothesis tests for which some authors argue that rejecting $\theta
= \theta_0$ does not allow to conclude that $\theta > \theta_0$ or $\theta <
\theta_0$ but only that $\theta \neq \theta_0$, while others argue that this is
a minor error without practical consequence.
  Discussion: new elements are brought to the debate. It is shown that the
directional interpretation of some non-directional hypothesis tests about
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and survival curves may lead to
inflated type III error rates with a probability of concluding that a
difference exists in the opposite side of the actual difference that can reach
50% in the worst case. Some of the issues of directional tests also apply to
two-sided confidence intervals (CIs). It is shown that equal-tailed CIs should
be preferred to shortest CIs. New assessment criteria of two-sided CIs and
hypothesis tests are proposed to provide a reliable directional interpretation:
partial left-sided and right-sided $\alpha$ error rates for hypothesis tests,
probabilities of overestimation and underestimation $\alpha_L$ and $\alpha_U$
and interval half-widths for two-sided CIs.
  Conclusion: two-sided CIs and two-sided tests are interpreted directionally.
This implies that directional interpretation be taken in account in the
development and evaluation of confidence intervals and tests.

solve a graph partitioning problem to minimize their communication overhead and
query run-time. Besides computational complexity -- optimal graph partitioning
is NP-hard -- another important consideration is the memory overhead.
Real-world graphs often have an immense size, such that loading the complete
graph into memory for partitioning is not economical or feasible. Currently,
the common approach to reduce memory overhead is to rely on streaming
partitioning algorithms. While the latest streaming algorithms lead to
reasonable partitioning quality on some graphs, they are still not completely
competitive to in-memory partitioners. In this paper, we propose a new system,
Hybrid Edge Partitioner (HEP), that can partition graphs that fit partly into
memory while yielding a high partitioning quality. HEP can flexibly adapt its
memory overhead by separating the edge set of the graph into two sub-sets. One
sub-set is partitioned by NE++, a novel, efficient in-memory algorithm, while
the other sub-set is partitioned by a streaming approach. Our evaluations on
large real-world graphs show that in many cases, HEP outperforms both in-memory
partitioning and streaming partitioning at the same time. Hence, HEP is an
attractive alternative to existing solutions that cannot fine-tune their memory
overheads. Finally, we show that using HEP, we achieve a significant speedup of
distributed graph processing jobs on Spark/GraphX compared to state-of-the-art
partitioning algorithms.

generation of large-scale magnetic fields in presence of a background linear
shear flow. Key techniques involved here are same as in our earlier work
\citep[][hereafter paper~I]{JS20}, where we have used the renovating flow based
model with shearing waves. Both, the velocity and the helicity fields, are
treated as stochastic variables with finite correlation times, $\tau$ and
$\tau_h$, respectively. Growing solutions are obtained when $\tau_h > \tau$,
even when this time-scale separation, characterised by $m=\tau_h/\tau$, remains
below the threshold for causing the turbulent diffusion to turn negative. In
regimes when turbulent diffusion remains positive, and $\tau$ is on the order
of eddy turnover time $T$, the axisymmetric modes display non-monotonic
behaviour with shear rate $S$: both, the growth rate $\gamma$ and the
wavenumber $k_\ast$ corresponding to the fastest growing mode, first increase,
reach a maximum and then decrease with $|S|$, with $k_\ast$ being always
smaller than eddy-wavenumber, thus boosting growth of magnetic fields at large
length scales. The cycle period $P_{\rm cyc}$ of growing dynamo wave is
inversely proportional to $|S|$ at small shear, exactly as in the fixed kinetic
helicity case of paper~I. This dependence becomes shallower at larger shear.
Interestingly enough, various curves corresponding to different choices of $m$
collapse on top of each other in a plot of $m P_{\rm cyc}$ with $|S|$.

standard measurement procedure ensures this paradoxical result. This
theoretical prediction, called weak value, was realized in numerous
experiments, but its meaning remains very controversial, since its ""anomalous""

thus an emerging yet crucial issue to detect vulnerabilities of different
classes in contracts in an efficient manner. Existing machine learning-based
vulnerability detection methods are limited and only inspect whether the smart
contract is vulnerable, or train individual classifiers for each specific
vulnerability, or demonstrate multi-class vulnerability detection without
extensibility consideration. To overcome the scalability and generalization
limitations of existing works, we propose ESCORT, the first Deep Neural Network
(DNN)-based vulnerability detection framework for Ethereum smart contracts that
support lightweight transfer learning on unseen security vulnerabilities, thus
is extensible and generalizable. ESCORT leverages a multi-output NN
architecture that consists of two parts: (i) A common feature extractor that
learns the semantics of the input contract; (ii) Multiple branch structures
where each branch learns a specific vulnerability type based on features
obtained from the feature extractor. Experimental results show that ESCORT
achieves an average F1-score of 95% on six vulnerability types and the
detection time is 0.02 seconds per contract. When extended to new vulnerability
types, ESCORT yields an average F1-score of 93%. To the best of our knowledge,
ESCORT is the first framework that enables transfer learning on new

high-aspect-ratio particles, the composite undergoes a transition in mechanical
strength when the inclusion phase surpasses a critical density. This phenomenon
(rheological or mechanical percolation) is well-known to occur in many
composites at a critical density that exceeds the conductivity percolation
threshold. Conductivity percolation occurs as a consequence of contact
percolation, which refers to the conducting particles' formation of a connected
component that spans the composite. Rheological percolation, however, has
evaded a complete theoretical explanation and predictive description. A natural
hypothesis is that rheological percolation arises due to rigidity percolation,
whereby a rigid component of inclusions spans the composite. We model
composites as random isotropic dispersions of soft-core rods, and study
rigidity percolation in such systems. Building on previous results for
two-dimensional systems, we develop an approximate algorithm that identifies
spanning rigid components through iteratively identifying and compressing
provably rigid motifs -- equivalently, decomposing giant rigid components into
rigid assemblies of successively smaller rigid components. We apply this
algorithm to random rod systems to estimate a rigidity percolation threshold
and explore its dependence on rod aspect ratio. We show that this transition
point, like the contact percolation transition point, scales inversely with the
average (aspect ratio-dependent) rod excluded volume. However, the scaling of
the rigidity percolation threshold, unlike the contact percolation scaling, is
valid for relatively low aspect ratio. Moreover, the critical rod contact
number is constant for aspect ratio above some relatively low value; and lies
below the prediction from Maxwell's isostatic condition.

with a conventional superconductor completely repelling an external magnetic
field. In contrast to this diamagnetic behavior, odd-frequency superconducting
pairing has often been seen to produce a paramagnetic Meissner effect, which
instead makes the superconductor unstable due to the attraction of magnetic
field. In this work we study how both even- and odd-frequency superconducting
pairing contributes to the Meissner effect in a generic two-orbital
superconductor with a tunable odd-frequency pairing component. By dividing the
contributions to the Meissner effect into intra- and inter-band processes, we
find that the odd-frequency pairing actually generates both dia- and
paramagnetic Meissner responses, determined by the normal-state band structure.
More specifically, for materials with two electron-like (hole-like) low-energy
bands we find that the odd-frequency inter-band contribution is paramagnetic
but nearly canceled by a diamagnetic odd-frequency intra-band contribution.
Combined with a diamagnetic even-frequency contribution, such superconductors
thus always display a large diamagnetic Meissner response to an external
magnetic field, even in the presence of large odd-frequency pairing. For
materials with an inverted, or topological, band structure, we find the
odd-frequency inter-band contribution to instead be diamagnetic and even the
dominating contribution to the Meissner effect in the near-metallic regime.
Taken together, our results show that odd-frequency pairing in multi-orbital
superconductors does not generate a destabilizing paramagnetic Meissner effect
and can even generate a diamagnetic response in topological materials.

vibrational contributions to the free energy. Surprisingly, we find that
although the structural parameters of PbTiO$_3$ thin-films evolve with
temperature as if they are dominated by linear elasticity, PbTiO$_3$ thin-films
are strongly anharmonic, with large changes in the elastic constants and
Gr\""{u}neisen parameters with both misfit strain and temperature. We show that
a fortuitous near-cancellation between different types of anharmonicity gives
rise to this behavior. Our results illustrate the importance of high-order
phonon-strain anharmonicity in determining the temperature-dependent structural
parameters of PbTiO$_3$ thin-films, and highlight the complex manner in which
thermal expansion, misfit strain and elastic and vibrational properties are
intertwined.

application difficult problems such image and speech recognition. However, when
practitioners want to design an ANN they need to undergo laborious process of
selecting a set of parameters and topology. Currently, there are several
state-of-the art methods that allow for the automatic selection of some of
these aspects. Learning Rate optimizers are a set of such techniques that
search for good values of learning rates. Whilst these techniques are effective
and have yielded good results over the years, they are general solution i.e.
they do not consider the characteristics of a specific network.
  We propose a framework called AutoLR to automatically design Learning Rate
Optimizers. Two versions of the system are detailed. The first one, Dynamic
AutoLR, evolves static and dynamic learning rate optimizers based on the
current epoch and the previous learning rate. The second version, Adaptive
AutoLR, evolves adaptive optimizers that can fine tune the learning rate for
each network eeight which makes them generally more effective. The results are
competitive with the best state of the art methods, even outperforming them in
some scenarios. Furthermore, the system evolved a classifier, ADES, that
appears to be novel and innovative since, to the best of our knowledge, it has
a structure that differs from state of the art methods.

optimal plans [for $N$ marginals discretized by $\ell$ gridpoints each, general
Kantorovich plans require $\ell^N$ gridpoints but the support of optimizers is
of size $O(\ell\cdot N)$ [FV18]], (ii) the method of column generation (CG)

MMOT, and (iii) ideas from machine learning. The well-known bottleneck in CG
consists in generating new candidate columns efficiently; we prove that in our
context, finding the best new column is an NP-complete problem. To overcome
this bottleneck we use a genetic learning method tailormade for MMOT in which
the dual state within CG plays the role of an ""adversary"", in loose similarity
to Wasserstein GANs. On a sequence of benchmark problems with up to 120
gridpoints and up to 30 marginals, our method always found the exact
optimizers. Moreover, empirically the number of computational steps needed to

instability is consistent with recent multi-wavelength ALMA observations in the
Lupus star forming region. We simulate the local action of streaming
instability in 2D using the code ATHENA, and examine the radiative properties
at mm wavelengths of the resulting clumpy dust distribution by focusing on two
observable quantities: the optically thick fraction $ff$ (in ALMA band 6) and
the spectral index $\alpha$ (in bands 3-7). By comparing the simulated
distribution in the $ff-\alpha$ plane before and after the action of streaming
instability, we observe that clump formation causes $ff$ to drop, because of
the suppression of emission from grains that end up in optically thick clumps.
$\alpha$, instead, can either increase or decline after the action of streaming
instability; we use a simple toy model to demonstrate that this behaviour
depends on the sizes of the grains whose emission is suppressed by being
incorporated in optically thick clumps. In particular, the sign of evolution of
$\alpha$ depends on whether grains near the opacity maximum at a few tenths of
a mm end up in clumps. By comparing the simulation distributions before/after
clump formation to the data distribution, we note that the action of streaming
instability drives simulations towards the area of the plane where the data are
located. We furthermore demonstrate that this behaviour is replicated in
integrated disc models provided that the instability is operative over a region
of the disc that contributes significantly to the total mm flux.

by patients with tuberculosis (TB) and those produced by patients with other
lung ailments.
  Approach: We present experiments based on a dataset of 1358 forced cough
recordings obtained in a developing-world clinic from 16 patients with
confirmed active pulmonary TB and 35 patients suffering from respiratory
conditions suggestive of TB but confirmed to be TB negative. Using nested
cross-validation, we have trained and evaluated five machine learning
classifiers: logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest
neighbour (KNN), multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks
(CNN).
  Main Results: Although classification is possible in all cases, the best
performance is achieved using LR. In combination with feature selection by
sequential forward selection (SFS), our best LR system achieves an area under
the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.94 using 23 features selected from a set of 78
high-resolution mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). This system
achieves a sensitivity of 93\% at a specificity of 95\% and thus exceeds the
90\% sensitivity at 70\% specificity specification considered by the World
Health Organisation (WHO) as a minimal requirement for a community-based TB
triage test.
  Significance: The automatic classification of cough audio sounds, when
applied to symptomatic patients requiring investigation for TB, can meet the
WHO triage specifications for the identification of patients who should undergo
expensive molecular downstream testing. This makes it a promising and viable
means of low cost, easily deployable frontline screening for TB, which can
benefit especially developing countries with a heavy TB burden.

deflect NEOs by virtue of missiles shot from the Earth-Moon L1 and L3
Lagrangian Points. A patent application has been filed for the relevant code
dubbed AsterOFF (=Asteroids OFF !). This code was already implemented, and a
copyright for it was registered. In a paper published in Acta Astronautica,
this author proved mathematically the following theorem: ""Within the sphere of
influence of the Earth, any NEO could be hit by a missile at just an angle of
90 degrees, was the missile shot from the Lagrangian Points L1 or L3 of the
Earth-Moon system, rather than from the surface of the Earth"". As a
consequence, the hitting missile would have to move along a ""confocal ellipse""
(centered at the Earth) uniquely determined by the NEO's incoming hyperbola.
The author further shows in this paper that: 1) The proposed defense system
would be ideal to deflect NEOs that are small, i.e. less than one kilometer in
diameter. 2) The traditional theory of Keplerian orbits can successfully be
applied to get an excellent first-order approximation of the mathematical
formulae of the energy-momentum requested to achieve the NEO deflection. Many
engineering details about the missiles shot from L1 and L3, however, still have
to be implemented into our simulations. 3) Was one missile not enough to
deflect the NEO completely, it is a great advantage of the ""confocal conics""
used here that the new, slightly deflected NEO's hyperbola would certainly be
hit at nearly 90 degrees by another and slightly more eccentric elliptical
missile trajectory. A sufficient number of missiles could thus be launched in a
sequence from the Earth-Moon Lagrangian points L1 and L3 with the result that
the SUM of all these small and repeated deflections will finally throw the NEO
off its collision hyperbola with the Earth.

In this context, alignments have proven to be useful for calculating
conformance statistics. However, for extensive event data and complex process
models, the computation time of alignments is considerably high, hampering
their practical use. Simultaneously, it suffices to approximate either
alignments or their corresponding conformance value(s) for many applications.
Recent work has shown that using subsets of the process model behavior leads to
accurate conformance approximations. The accuracy of such an approximation
heavily depends on the selected subset of model behavior. Thus, in this paper,
we show that we can derive a priori error bounds for conformance checking
approximation based on arbitrary activity sequences, independently of the given
process model. Such error bounds subsequently let us select the most relevant
subset of process model behavior for the alignment approximation. Experiments
confirm that conformance approximation accuracy improves when using the

cross-disciplinary comparisons, but different characteristics can also be
observed depending on whether a discipline is studied in isolation or in
combination with others. To validate the study results and to report on a
general consciousness of TD in the disciplines, this follow-up study involves
15 of the 50 experts of the predecessor study and reflects the frequency and
impact of technical debt in industrial experts' daily work using a

results for the most frequent TD types and causes, yet they show divergent

automated fragment formula annotation for unknown compounds measured by
GC-EI-HRMS. Based on co-eluting mass/charge fragments, we developed an
innovative data analysis method to reliably reconstruct the chemical formulae
of the fragments, using efficient combinatorics and graph theory. The method
does not require the presence of the molecular ion, which is absent in ~40% of
EI spectra. Our method has been trained and validated on \textgreater50
halocarbons and hydrocarbons, with 3 to 20 atoms and molar masses of 30 to 330

compounds, more than 90% of the annotated fragment formulae are correct. Cases
of wrong identification can be attributed to the scarcity of detected fragments
per compound or the lack of isotopic constraint (no minor isotopocule
detected).Our method enables to reconstruct most probable chemical formulae
independently from spectral databases. Therefore, it demonstrates the
suitability of EI-HRMS data for non-target analysis and paves the way for the
identification of substances for which no EI mass spectrum is registered in
databases. We illustrate the performances of our method for atmospheric trace
gases and suggest that it may be well suited for many other types of samples.

teacher, an evolutionary teacher is learned online and consistently transfers
intermediate knowledge to supervise student network learning on-the-fly. To
enhance intermediate knowledge representation and mimicking, several simple

low bit-width model suffers from poor clean (i.e., no attack) inference
accuracy. To counter this, we propose a novel and efficient two-stage network
growing method, named Early-Growth. It selectively grows the channel size of

growing also shows significantly higher resistance to BFA. Our evaluation of
the CIFAR-10 dataset shows that the proposed RA-BNN can improve the clean model
accuracy by ~2-8 %, compared with a baseline BNN, while simultaneously
improving the resistance to BFA by more than 125 x. Moreover, on ImageNet, with

class-discriminant representations to tackle this task. These methods, however,
ignore the interaction between domain alignment learning and class
discrimination learning. As a result, the missing or inadequate tradeoff
between domain alignment and class discrimination are prone to the problem of
negative transfer. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Weighted Learning (DWL) to
avoid the discriminability vanishing problem caused by excessive alignment
learning and domain misalignment problem caused by excessive discriminant
learning. Technically, DWL dynamically weights the learning losses of alignment
and discriminability by introducing the degree of alignment and
discriminability. Besides, the problem of sample imbalance across domains is
first considered in our work, and we solve the problem by weighing the samples
to guarantee information balance across domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DWL has an excellent performance in several benchmark
datasets.

memory replay has shown promising results, the recency bias in online learning
caused by the commonly used Softmax classifier remains an unsolved challenge.
Although the Nearest-Class-Mean (NCM) classifier is significantly undervalued
in the CL community, we demonstrate that it is a simple yet effective
substitute for the Softmax classifier. It addresses the recency bias and avoids
structural changes in the fully-connected layer for new classes. Moreover, we
observe considerable and consistent performance gains when replacing the
Softmax classifier with the NCM classifier for several state-of-the-art replay
methods. To leverage the NCM classifier more effectively, data embeddings
belonging to the same class should be clustered and well-separated from those
with a different class label. To this end, we contribute Supervised Contrastive
Replay (SCR), which explicitly encourages samples from the same class to
cluster tightly in embedding space while pushing those of different classes
further apart during replay-based training. Overall, we observe that our
proposed SCR substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting and outperforms
state-of-the-art CL methods by a significant margin on a variety of datasets.

positive Lyapunov exponents. It is characterized by more complex dynamics and a
wider range of applications as compared to those non-time-delay chaotic
systems. In a three-dimensional general Lorenz chaotic system, time delays can
be applied at different positions to build multiple heterogeneous Lorenz
systems with a single time delay. Despite the same equilibrium point for
multiple heterogeneous Lorenz systems with single time delay, their stability
and Hopf bifurcation conditions are different due to the difference in time
delay position. In this paper, the theory of nonlinear dynamics is applied to
investigate the stability of the heterogeneous single-time-delay Lorenz system
at the zero equilibrium point and the conditions required for the occurrence of
Hopf bifurcation. First of all, the equilibrium point of each heterogeneous
Lorenz system is calculated, so as to determine the condition that only zero
equilibrium point exists. Then, an analysis is conducted on the distribution of
the corresponding characteristic equation roots at the zero equilibrium point
of the system to obtain the critical point of time delay at which the system is
asymptotically stable at the zero equilibrium point and the Hopf bifurcation.
Finally, mathematical software is applied to carry out simulation verification.
Heterogeneous Lorenz systems with time delay have potential applications in
secure communication and other fields.

end-users to foster behavioral changes towards a common goal. In general these
systems use gamification principles in non-games contexts. Over the years,
gamification has gained consensus among researchers and practitioners as a tool
to motivate people to perform activities with the ultimate goal of promoting
behavioural change, or engaging the users to perform activities that can offer
relevant benefits but which can be seen as unrewarding and even tedious.
  There exists a plethora of heterogeneous application scenarios towards
reaching the common good that can benefit from gamification. However, an open
problem is how to effectively combine multiple motivational campaigns to
maximise the degree of participation without exposing the system to
counterproductive behaviours.
  We conceive motivational digital systems as multi-agent systems:
self-adaptation is a feature of the overall system, while individual agents may
self-adapt in order to leverage other agents' resources, functionalities and
capabilities to perform tasks more efficiently and effectively. Consequently,
multiple campaigns can be run and adapted to reach common good. At the same
time, agents are grouped into micro-communities in which agents contribute with
their own social capital and leverage others' capabilities to balance their
weaknesses.
  In this paper we propose our vision on how the principles at the base of the
autonomous and multi-agent systems can be exploited to design multi-challenge
motivational systems to engage smart communities towards common goals. We
present an initial version of a general framework based on the MAPE-K loop and
a set of research challenges that characterise our research roadmap for the
implementation of our vision.

spacetime with dimension determined by the motion-correlation $\cM_c$-spin
charge and the emergence of $\cM_c$-spin/hyperspin symmetry as fundamental
symmetry. Intrinsic $\cQ_c$-spin charge displays a periodic feature as the mod
4 qubit number, which enables us to classify all entangled qubit-spinor fields
and spacetime dimensions into four categories with respective to four

string that rocks back and forth, a rotating soliton in a 2D membrane, and
various other cases are presented as examples. It is shown that traveling knots
based on classical wave equation are plausible. Cases in which all the motions
are solitons are also presented. Compatibility of equations of motion with the
kinematic constraint is explored and demonstrated.

  arXiv:1912.08052",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It was supposed for fifty years that the conformal gauge in string theory
exists globally on the whole string world sheet. In fact, almost all results
were obtained under this assumption. However, this statement was proved only
locally in some neighbourhood of an arbitrary point on the worldsheet, and its
extension is far from being obvious. In the present paper we prove that the
conformal gauge does exists globally on the string worldsheet represented by an
infinite strip with straight parallel boundaries.

galaxy. Here, an analytical model is built to simulate that field in an
axisymmetric galaxy. This analytical model is based on an explicit
representation for axisymmetric source-free Maxwell fields. In a previous work,
the general applicability of this representation has been proved. The model is
adjusted by fitting to it the sum of spherical radiations emitted by the
composing ""stars"". The huge ratio distance/wavelength needs to implement a
numerical precision better than the quadruple precision. The model passes a
validation test based on a spherically symmetric solution. The results for a
set of ""stars"" representative of a disk galaxy indicate that the field is
highest near to the disk axis, and there the axial component of ${\bf E}$
dominates over the radial one. This work will allow us in the future to check
if the interaction energy predicted by an alternative theory of gravitation
might be a component of dark matter.
  {\bf Keywords:} Disk galaxy; Maxwell equations; axial symmetry; exact
solutions; numerical model; dark matter.
