crossing a chiral plasma at finite temperature characterized by an imbalance
between the populations of left-handed and right-handed fermions. We find a new
contribution to the energy loss which is proportional to the helicity of the
test fermion and depends on the amount of chiral imbalance in the plasma. We
then compute the difference between the energy loss of a fermion with the two
opposite helicities, to assess whether this could be used to quantify the
chiral imbalance in the plasma. We find that the leading contribution to these
helicity-dependent energy loss contributions comes from the exchange of hard
photons (or gluons for QCD) with the medium constituents, and in some scenarios
can become comparable to the leading-order result for a plasma without any
chiral imbalance. We also evaluate the contribution arising from soft photon
exchange, which is a subleading effect, and requires regularization. We
illustrate how dimensional regularization is a well suited prescription to be
applied to these energy loss computations.

shown to enable unique electromagnetic phenomena such as non-reciprocity,
beam-steering, frequency conversion, and amplification. In practice,
traveling-wave modulation is achieved by applying a staggered time-modulation
signal to a spatially-discrete array of unit cells. Therefore, the capability
to accurately simulate spatially-discrete traveling-wave modulated structures
is critical to design. However, simulating these structures is challenging due
to the complex space-time dependence of the constituent unit cells. In this
paper, a field relation (referred to as the interpath relation) is derived for
spatially-discrete traveling-wave modulated structures. The interpath relation
reveals that the field within a single time-modulated unit cell (rather than an
entire spatial period) is sufficient to determine the field solution throughout
space. It will be shown that the interpath relation can be incorporated into
existing periodic method of moments solvers simply by modifying the source
basis functions. As a result, the computational domain is reduced from an
entire spatial period to a single time-modulated unit cell, dramatically
reducing the number of unknowns. In the context of traveling-wave modulation,
this enables researchers to efficiently simulate both complex structures with
patterned unit cells in addition to continuous structures with infinitesimal
unit cells.

use of a random continuous dielectric function as an adjoint variable
distribution, is known to be one of the most efficient optimization methods
that enable the design of optical devices with outstanding performances.
However, the strategy for selecting the optimal solution requires a very fine
pixelation of the permittivity function of the profile under optimization.
Typically, at least 28 pixels are needed while optimizing a one wavelength wide
1D metagrating. This makes it very difficult to extend TO methods to
large-scale optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of
adjoint-based topology optimization that enables fast and efficient geometry
based design of both periodic and aperiodic metasurfaces. The structures are
built from nano-rods whose widths and positions are to be adjusted. Our new
approach requires a very low number of design parameters, thus leading to a
drastic reduction in the computational time: about an order of magnitude.
Hence, this concept makes it possible to address the optimization of
large-scale structures in record time. As a proof-of-concept we apply this
method to the design of (i) a periodic metagrating, optimized to have a
specific response into a particular direction, and (ii) a dielectric metalens
(aperiodic metasurface), enabling a high energy focusing into a well-defined
focal spot.

scattering problems. The main focus is on plane waves scattered by smoothly
varying material inhomogeneities. The proposed method works for any frequency
$\omega$, but is especially efficient for high-frequency problems. It is based
on a time-domain approach and consists of three steps: \emph{i)} computation of
a suitable incoming plane wavelet with compact support in the propagation
direction; \emph{ii)} solving a scattering problem in the time domain for the
incoming plane wavelet; \emph{iii)} reconstruction of the time-harmonic
solution from the time-domain solution via a Fourier transform in time. An
essential ingredient of the new method is a front-tracking mesh adaptation
algorithm for solving the problem in \emph{ii)}. By exploiting the limited
support of the wave front, this allows us to make the number of the required
degrees of freedom to reach a given accuracy significantly less dependent on
the frequency $\omega$. We also present a new algorithm for computing the
Fourier transform in \emph{iii)} that exploits the reduced number of degrees of
freedom corresponding to the adapted meshes. Numerical examples demonstrate the
advantages of the proposed method and the fact that the method can also be
applied with external source terms such as point sources and sound-soft
scatterers. The gained efficiency, however, is limited in the presence of
trapping modes.

their 3d positions in camera coordinates. Given the inherent noise and
inaccuracy from estimating depth maps from monocular images, we perform an
extensive statistical analysis showing that given this noise there is still a
statistically significant correlation between the predicted depth values and
the third coordinate of camera coordinates. We further explain how the

global CO$_2$ emissions gradually recovered towards 2019 levels from late April
with global partial re-opening. More importantly, global CO$_2$ emissions even
increased slightly by +0.9% in December 2020 compared with 2019, indicating the
trends of rebound of global emissions. Later waves of COVID-19 infections in
late 2020 and corresponding lockdowns have caused further CO$_2$ emissions

hole ellipsoids at the N point in the Brillouin zone. In clear contrast to the
other Fermi surface sheets, which are purely of d character, these arise from a
band that has a significant proportion of p character. By performing local
density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), strongly
constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA, and GW approximation
calculations, we find that the p character part of this band (and therefore the
Fermi surface) is particularly sensitive to the exchange-correlation
approximation. LDA and GGA calculations inadequately describe this feature,
predicting N hole ellipsoid sizes that are consistently too large in comparison
to various experimental measurements, whereas quasiparticle self-consistent GW
calculations predict a size that is slightly too small (and non-self-consistent
GW calculations that use an LDA starting point predict a size that is much too
small). Overall, for the metals tested here, SCAN provides the most accurate
Fermi surface predictions, mostly correcting the discrepancies between
measurements and calculations that were observed when LDA calculations were
used. However, none of the tested exchange-correlation approximations succeeds
in simultaneously bringing all of the measurable properties of these metals
into good experimental agreement, particularly where magnetism is concerned.
The SCAN calculations predict antiferromagnetic moments for Cr that are 3 times
larger than the experimental value (1.90 $\mu_B$ compared to 0.62 $\mu_B$).

emphasize the role of retrieval: a system first retrieves evidence from a large
collection and then extracts answers. This open-retrieval ConvQA setting
typically assumes that each question is answerable by a single span of text
within a particular passage (a span answer). The supervision signal is thus
derived from whether or not the system can recover an exact match of this
ground-truth answer span from the retrieved passages. This method is referred
to as span-match weak supervision. However, information-seeking conversations
are challenging for this span-match method since long answers, especially
freeform answers, are not necessarily strict spans of any passage. Therefore,
we introduce a learned weak supervision approach that can identify a
paraphrased span of the known answer in a passage. Our experiments on QuAC and
CoQA datasets show that the span-match weak supervisor can only handle
conversations with span answers, and has less satisfactory results for freeform
answers generated by people. Our method is more flexible as it can handle both
span answers and freeform answers. Moreover, our method can be more powerful
when combined with the span-match method which shows it is complementary to the
span-match method. We also conduct in-depth analyses to show more insights on
open-retrieval ConvQA under a weak supervision setting.

the magnetic field towards their elimination. With this in mind as our target,
we observe that such locations can be found using a new indicator: the velocity
of the Lorentz transformation that eliminates two components of the local
magnetic field. Serendipitously, the indicator naturally becomes subluminal in
the close proximity of a point where two components of the magnetic field
vanish and it is hard zero at the vanishing location. Everywhere else the
velocity of this Lorentz frame change far exceeds the speed of light. This
property can be quickly applied in practice because computing the frame change
is a local operation that requires only the knowledge of the local magnetic and
electric field: it can be applied in a simulation or in observational data from
a field instrument. We further show that the points identified can be
classified in 6 categories that extend the usual types of magnetic nulls to the
case of 3D reconnection in presence of a guide field. The approach is used to
identify secondary electron scale reconnection sites in a turbulent outflow
from a primary reconnection site in a highly resolved massively parallel fully

communities itself. Previous work on modularity has developed many efficient
algorithms for modularity maximization. However, few of researchers considered
the interpretation of the modularity function itself. In this paper, we study
modularity from an information-theoretical perspective and show that modularity
and mutual information in networks are essentially the same. The main
contribution is that we develop a family of generalized modularity measures,
f-modularity based on f-mutual information. f-Modularity has an
information-theoretical interpretation, enjoys the desired properties of mutual
information measure, and provides an approach to estimate the mutual
information between discrete random variables. At a high level, we show the
significance of community structure is equivalent to the amount of information
contained in the network. The connection of f-modularity and f-mutual
information bridges two important fields, complex network and information
theory and also sheds light on the design of measures on community structure in

and rating the quality of contents in a Head-Mounted Display (HMD),
(B)visualizing the contents in an HMD,and (C)visualizing the contents in an HMD
where participants can see their hands and take notes. The experiment simulates
an immersive communication where participants attend conversations of different
genres and from different acquisition perspectives in the context of
international experiences. Video quality is evaluated with Single-Stimulus
Discrete Quality Evaluation (SSDQE) methodology. Spatial and social presence
are evaluated with questionnaires adapted from the literature. Initial empathy
is assessed with Interpersonal Reactivity Index(IRI) and a questionnaire is
designed to evaluate attitude. Attention is evaluated with 3 questions that had
pass/fail answers. 54 participants were evenly distributed among A, B, and C
conditions taking into account their international experience backgrounds,
obtaining a diverse sample of participants. The results from the subjective
test validate the proposed methodology in VR communications, showing that video
quality experiments can be adapted to conditions imposed by experiments focused
on the evaluation of socioemotional features in terms of contents of
long-duration, actor and observer acquisition perspectives, and genre. In
addition, the positive results related to the sense of presence imply that
technology can be relevant in the analyzed use case. The acquisition
perspective greatly influences social presence and all the contents have a
positive impact on all participants on their attitude towards international
experiences. The annotated dataset, Student Experiences Around the World
dataset (SEAW-dataset), obtained from the experiment is made publicly
available.

with time-frequency-entangled photon pairs (EPP) has been predicted to display
a variety of fascinating effects. Therefore, their potential use in practical
quantum-enhanced molecular spectroscopy requires close examination. This paper
presents in tutorial style a detailed theoretical study of one- and two-photon
absorption by molecules, focusing on how to treat the quantum nature of light.
We review some basic quantum optics theory, then we review the density-matrix
(Liouville) derivation of molecular optical response, emphasizing how to
incorporate quantum states of light into the treatment. For illustration we
treat in detail the TPA of photon pairs created by spontaneous parametric down
conversion, with an emphasis on how quantum light TPA differs from that with
classical light. In particular, we treat the question of how much enhancement
of the TPA rate can be achieved using entangled states. The paper includes
review of known theoretical methods and results, as well as some extensions,
especially the comparison of TPA processes that occur via far-off-resonant
intermediate states only and those that involve off-resonant intermediate state
by virtue of dephasing processes. A brief discussion of the main challenges
facing experimental studies of entangled TPA is also given.

investigates multi-channel AEC (MCAEC) and multi-microphone AEC (MMAEC). We
train a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the near-end speech from
microphone signals with far-end signals used as additional information. We find
that the deep learning approach avoids the non-uniqueness problem in
traditional MCAEC algorithms. For the AEC setup with multiple microphones,
rather than employing AEC for each microphone, a single DNN is trained to
achieve echo removal for all microphones. Also, combining deep learning based
AEC with deep learning based beamforming further improves the system
performance. Experimental results show the effectiveness of both bidirectional
long short-term memory (BLSTM) and convolutional recurrent network (CRN) based
methods for MCAEC and MMAEC. Furthermore, deep learning based methods are
capable of removing echo and noise simultaneously and work well in the presence
of nonlinear distortions.

fraction marking both the first and second transitions of the system. At a
large enough size difference, e.g., $\delta \le 0.22$, $X^{*}_{\mathrm S}$
divides the diagram with most small particles either non-jammed or jammed
jointly with large ones. We find that the bulk modulus $K$ jumps at
$X^{*}_{\mathrm S}(\delta = 0.15) \approx 0.21$, at the maximum jamming
density, where both particle species mix most efficiently, while for
$X_{\mathrm S} < X^{*}_{\mathrm S}$ $K$ is decoupled in two scenarios as a
result of the first and second jamming transition. Along the second transition,
$K$ rises relative to the values found at the first transition, however, is
still small compared to $K$ at $X^{*}_{\mathrm S}$. While the first transition
is sharp, the second is smooth, carried by small-large interactions, while the
small-small contacts display a transition. This demonstrates that for low
enough $\delta$ and $X_{\mathrm S}$, the jamming of small particles indeed
impacts the internal resistance of the system. Our new results will allow
tuning the bulk modulus $K$ or other properties, such as the wave speed, by
choosing specific sizes and concentrations based on a better understanding of
whether small particles contribute to the jammed structure or not, and how the

with the goal of assigning a representative vector to each one, possibly under
some constraints (such as the collection of vectors being standardized, i.e.,
having zero mean and unit covariance). We are given data indicating that some
pairs of items are similar, and optionally, some other pairs are dissimilar.
For pairs of similar items, we want the corresponding vectors to be near each
other, and for dissimilar pairs, we want the corresponding vectors to not be
near each other, measured in Euclidean distance. We formalize this by
introducing distortion functions, defined for some pairs of the items. Our goal
is to choose an embedding that minimizes the total distortion, subject to the
constraints. We call this the minimum-distortion embedding (MDE) problem.
  The MDE framework is simple but general. It includes a wide variety of
embedding methods, such as spectral embedding, principal component analysis,
multidimensional scaling, dimensionality reduction methods (like Isomap and
UMAP), force-directed layout, and others. It also includes new embeddings, and
provides principled ways of validating historical and new embeddings alike.
  We develop a projected quasi-Newton method that approximately solves MDE
problems and scales to large data sets. We implement this method in PyMDE, an
open-source Python package. In PyMDE, users can select from a library of
distortion functions and constraints or specify custom ones, making it easy to
rapidly experiment with different embeddings. Our software scales to data sets
with millions of items and tens of millions of distortion functions. To
demonstrate our method, we compute embeddings for several real-world data sets,
including images, an academic co-author network, US county demographic data,

shear deformations, the recently developed mathematical framework of medium
amplitude parallel superposition (MAPS) rheology reveals that this generalized
nonlinear Maxwell model can produce only a limited number of distinct
signatures, which combine linearly in a well-posed basis expansion for the
third order complex viscosity. This basis expansion represents a library of
MAPS signatures for distinct constitutive models that are contained within the
generalized nonlinear Maxwell model. We describe a framework for quantitative
model identification using this basis expansion, and discuss its limitations in
distinguishing distinct nonlinear features of the underlying constitutive
models from medium amplitude shear stress data. The leading order contributions
to the normal stress differences are also considered, revealing that only the
second normal stress difference provides distinct information about the weakly
nonlinear response space of the model. After briefly considering the conditions
for time-strain separability within the generalized nonlinear Maxwell model, we
apply the basis expansion of the third order complex viscosity to derive the
medium amplitude signatures of the model in specific shear deformation
protocols. Finally, we use these signatures for estimation of model parameters
from rheological data obtained by these different deformation protocols,
revealing that three-tone oscillatory shear deformations produce data that is
readily able to distinguish all features of the medium amplitude, simple shear
response space of this generalized class of constitutive models.

Traditional methods, based on image registration to a global template,

population-based analyses, suited primarily to studying group-average effects.
In this paper we therefore take advantage of recent developments in generative
deep learning to develop a method for simultaneous classification, or
regression, and feature attribution (FA). Specifically, we explore the use of a
VAE-GAN translation network called ICAM, to explicitly disentangle class
relevant features from background confounds for improved interpretability and
regression of neurological phenotypes. We validate our method on the tasks of
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cognitive test score prediction for the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, as well as brain age
prediction, for both neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, using the

that the generated FA maps can be used to explain outlier predictions and
demonstrate that the inclusion of a regression module improves the

might explain the formation of massive or wide-orbit gas giant exoplanets. The
situation with regard to Jupiter-mass exoplanets orbiting within $\sim$ 20 au
is more uncertain. Theoretical models yield divergent assessments often
attributed to the numerical handling of the gas thermodynamics. Boss (2019)
used the $\beta$ cooling approximation to calculate three dimensional
hydrodynamical models of the evolution of disks with initial masses of 0.091
$M_\odot$ extending from 4 to 20 au around 1 $M_\odot$ protostars. The models
considered a wide range (1 to 100) of $\beta$ cooling parameters and started
from an initial minimum Toomre stability parameter of $Q_i = 2.7$
(gravitationally stable). The disks cooled down from initial outer disk
temperatures of 180 K to as low as 40 K as a result of the $\beta$ cooling,
leading to fragmentation into dense clumps, which were then replaced by virtual
protoplanets (VPs) and evolved for up to $\sim$ 500 yr. The present models test
the viability of replacing dense clumps with VPs by quadrupling the spatial
resolution of the grid once dense clumps form, sidestepping in most cases VP
insertion. After at least $\sim$ 200 yr of evolution, the new results compare
favorably with those of Boss (2019): similar numbers of VPs and dense clumps
form by the same time for the two approaches. The results imply that VP
insertion can greatly speed disk instability calculations without sacrificing
accuracy.

are analyzed to study the effect of changing the different components of a
perovskite compound, be it A, B, or X. Four different films are compared:
FAMAPbSnI3, FAPbI3, FAMAPbI3, and FAPbBr3. The low temperature results
highlight the changes that occur especially, underlying ones that are easily
masked at room temperature. The overall Stokes shift is of similar magnitude at
room temperature for the 3 Pb only based samples. This is governed by the
interaction strength GammaLO, phonon energy ELO, and the exciton binding energy
Eex. One exception to this behavior is the Sn-based FAMAPbSnI3 film which shows
a lack of Stokes shift between the absorption and photoluminescence.
However,the strong absorption (more than 100 meV) below the band gap is
indicative of an excitonic feature that has a large density of states.
Transient absorption measurements confirm the trends observed in continuous
wave (CW) measurements, the 3 Pb only films all show the convolution of an
excitonic feature within 20 meV of the band gap as a contributing factor to the
photobleach along with a region of high energy PIA. However, the behavior for
the Sn-based film is notably different (just as in the CW measurements) with an
unusual low energy PIA and a lack of high energy PIA. The large low energy PIA
is attributed to the large sub band gap absorption observed in the CW
transmission/absorption measurements. Notably regardless of interchanging
components, the slow cooling of carriers in metal-halide perovsites shows
little effect of GammaLO, ELO, and Eex. As such, here it is proposed: while the
initial cooling of carriers is attributed to LO phonons, the overall cooling of
carriers is dominated by the intrinsic low thermal conductivity of all
metal-halide perovskites which limits the dissipation of acoustic phonons in
these systems.

perturbations of the inner part of the solar system by the giant-planets,
leading to enhanced impact velocities and subsequent collisional erosion. We
quantitatively estimate the effect of collisional erosion on the resulting
composition of Earth, and estimate how it may provide information on the
dynamical context of its formation. We simulate and quantify the erosion of
Earth's crust in the context of Solar System formation scenarios, including the
classical model and Grand Tack scenario that invokes orbital migration of
Jupiter during the gaseous disk phase (Walsh et al., 2011; Raymond et al.,
2018). We find that collisional erosion of the early crust is unlikely to
produce an excess of about 6% of the Sm/Nd ratio in terrestrial rock samples
compared to chondrites for most simulations. Only Grand Tack simulations in
which the last giant impact on Earth occurred later than 50 million years after
the start of Solar System formation can account for such an offset. However,
this time frame is consistent with current cosmochemical and dynamical
estimates of the Moon forming impact (Chyba, 1991; Walker, 2009; Touboul et
al.,2007, 2009, 2015; Pepin and Porcelli, 2006; Norman et al., 2003; Nyquist et
al., 2006; Boyet et al.,2015). Such a late fractionation in the Sm/Nd ratio is
unlikely to be responsible for a 20-ppm $^{142}$Nd excess in terrestrial rocks
due to the half life of the radiogenic system. Additionally, such a large and
late fractionation in the Sm/Nd ratio would accordingly induce non-observed
anomalies in the $^{143}$Nd/$^{144}$Nd ratio. Considering our results, the
Grand Tack model with a late Moon-forming impact cannot be easily reconciled
with the Nd isotopic Earth contents.

become increasingly evident for CsPbBr3 perovskites that the Pb-Br framework
flexibility plays a key role in their light-activated functionality, the
corresponding local structural rearrangement has not yet been unambiguously
identified. In this work, we demonstrate that the photoinduced lattice changes
in the system are due to a specific polaronic distortion, associated with the
activation of a longitudinal optical phonon mode at 18 meV by electron-phonon
coupling, and we quantify the associated structural changes with atomic-level
precision. Key to this achievement is the combination of time-resolved and
temperature-dependent studies at Br K-edge and Pb L3-edge X-ray absorption with
refined ab-initio simulations, which fully account for the screened core-hole
final state effects on the X-ray absorption spectra. From the temporal
kinetics, we show that carrier recombination reversibly unlocks the structural
deformation at both Br and Pb sites. The comparison with the
temperature-dependent XAS results rules out thermal effects as the primary
source of distortion of the Pb-Br bonding motif during photoexcitation. Our
work provides a comprehensive description of the CsPbBr3 perovskites

Capturing the spatio-temporal relationship of the big data often requires a

graph with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to construct a structural RNN
(SRNN). The SRNN employs a spatio-temporal graph to infer the interaction
between adjacent road segments as well as the temporal dynamics of the time
series data. The model is scalable thanks to two key aspects. First, the
proposed SRNN architecture is built by using the semantic similarity of the
spatio-temporal dynamic interactions of all segments. Second, we design the
architecture to deal with fixed-length tensors regardless of the graph
topology. With the real traffic speed data measured in the city of Santander,
we demonstrate the proposed SRNN outperforms the image-based approaches using
the capsule network (CapsNet) by 14.1% and the convolutional neural network

Moreover, we show that the proposed model is scalable. The SRNN model trained

of the receptive fields of all convolutional units were estimated by
activation-weighted average (AWA) and activation-weighted covariance (AWC)
analyses. In the middle layers (convolutional layers in block3 and block4), AWC
analysis successfully reconstructed the receptive field that predicted the
visual feature selectivity of the unit. Those results suggested the possibility
that analyzing the reconstructed receptive field structure can be used to
interpret the functional significance of the units and layers of a DCNN.

manufacturability issues of topologically optimized structures, particularly
those represented as discrete density maps. However, the optimization of such
cellular structures is challenging due to the multiscale design problem. Past
work addressing this problem generally either only optimizes the volume
fraction of single-type unit cells but ignores the effects of unit cell
geometry on properties, or considers the geometry-property relation but builds
this relation via heuristics. In contrast, we propose a simple yet more
principled way to accurately model the property to geometry mapping using a
conditional deep generative model, named Inverse Homogenization Generative
Adversarial Network (IH-GAN). It learns the conditional distribution of unit
cell geometries given properties and can realize the one-to-many mapping from
properties to geometries. We further reduce the complexity of IH-GAN by using
the implicit function parameterization to represent unit cell geometries.
Results show that our method can 1) generate various unit cells that satisfy
given material properties with high accuracy ($R^2$-scores between target
properties and properties of generated unit cells $>98\%$) and 2) improve the
optimized structural performance over the conventional variable-density
single-type structure. In the minimum compliance example, our IH-GAN generated
structure achieves a $79.7\%$ reduction in concentrated stress and an extra
$3.03\%$ reduction in displacement. In the target deformation examples, our
IH-GAN generated structure reduces the target matching error by $86.4\%$ and
$79.6\%$ for two test cases, respectively. We also demonstrated that the
connectivity issue for multi-type unit cells can be solved by transition layer
blending.

Bridge, a stream of gas and stars pulled out of the SMC towards the LMC about
150 Myr ago. The tidal counterpart of this structure, which should include a
trailing arm, has been predicted by models but no compelling observational
evidence has confirmed the Counter-Bridge so far. Aims. The main goal of this
work is to find the stellar counterpart of the Magellanic Bridge and
Counter-Bridge. We use star clusters in the SMC outskirts as they provide 6D
phase-space vector, age and metallicity that help characterise the outskirts of
the SMC. Methods. Distances, ages and photometric metallicities are derived
from fitting isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams from the VISCACHA
survey. Radial velocities and spectroscopic metallicities are derived from the
spectroscopic follow-up using GMOS in the CaII triplet region. Results. Among
the seven clusters analysed in this work, five belong to the Magellanic Bridge
and one belongs to the Counter-Bridge and the other to the transition region.
Conclusions. The existence of the tidal counterpart of the Magellanic Bridge is
evidenced by star clusters. The stellar component of the Magellanic Bridge and
Counter-Bridge are confirmed in the SMC outskirts. These results are an
important constraint for models that seek to reconstruct the history of the

GW detections, and would yield detection rates of $\mathcal{R}_{\rm{det}}

main-sequence (MS) massive stars. The simultaneous presence of these stars can
only be explained by stellar models if the cluster has a finely-tuned age of
4-5Myr, with several published studies independently claiming ages within this
range. At this age, stellar models predict that the cool supergiants (CSGs)
should have luminosities of $\log(L/L_\odot) \approx 5.5$, close to the
empirical luminosity limit. Here, we test that prediction using archival data
and new photometry from SOFIA to estimate bolometric luminosities for the CSGs.
We find that these stars are on average 0.4dex too faint to be 5Myr old,
regardless of which stellar evolution model is used, and instead are indicative
of a much older age of $10.4^{+1.3}_{-1.2}$Myr. We argue that neither
systematic uncertainties in the extinction law nor stellar variability can
explain this discrepancy. In reviewing various independent age estimates of Wd1
in the literature, we firstly show that those based on stellar diversity are
unreliable. Secondly, we re-analyse Wd1's pre-MS stars employing the Damineli
extinction law, finding an age of $7.2^{+1.1}_{-2.3}$Myr; older than that of
previous studies, but which is vulnerable to systematic errors that could push
the age close to 10Myr. However, there remains significant tension between the
CSG age and that inferred from the eclipsing binary W13. We conclude that
stellar evolution models cannot explain Wd1 under the single age paradigm.
Instead, we propose that the stars in the Wd1 region formed over a period of
several Myr.

compared to blue QSOs, have been recently discovered, positioning them as a
potential key population in the evolution of galaxies and black holes across
cosmic time. To elucidate their nature, we exploited a rich compilation of
photometry and spectroscopic data to model their spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) from the UV to the FIR and characterise their emission-line properties.
Following a systematic comparison approach, we infer the AGN accretion,
obscuration, and host galaxy properties in a sample of ~1800 QSOs at 0.2<z<2.5,
classified into red and control QSOs and matched in redshift and luminosity. We
find no differences in the average SEDs of red and control QSOs, other than the
reddening of the accretion disk expected by the selection. Moreover, no clear
link can be recognised between the QSO reddening and the interstellar medium or
the star formation properties of their host galaxies. We find that the torus
properties in red and control QSOs are strikingly similar, suggesting that the
reddening is not related to the torus and orientation effects. Interestingly,
we detect a significant excess of infrared emission at rest-frame 2-5 um, which
shows a direct correlation with optical reddening. To explain its origin, we
investigated the presence of outflow signatures in the QSO spectra, discovering
a higher incidence of broad [OIII] wings and high CIV velocity shifts (>1000
km/s) in red QSOs. We find that red QSOs that exhibit evidence for
high-velocity winds present a stronger signature of the infrared excess,
suggesting a causal connection between reddening and the presence of hot dust
in QSO winds. We propose that dusty winds at nuclear scales are potentially the
physical ingredient responsible for the colours in red QSOs, as well as a key
parameter for the regulation of accretion material in the nucleus.

unusually high nickel mass fraction of $f_{\rm Ni}\approx 31\%$ ($M_{\rm

magnetar spin-down and radioactive heating model we find a better match with

7.2$ ms and magnetic field of $B\approx 10^{14}$ G, and $f_{\rm Ni}\lesssim

explained as circumstellar interaction with $\approx 0.7$ $M_\odot$ of
hydrogen-free material located $\approx 400$ AU from the progenitor. Including

solutions to classical dynamical systems, non-perturbative solutions of various
large-N field theories, and closely related solitonic solutions to the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in the theory of superconductivity. These
solutions rely on the inverse scattering method, which reduces these seemingly
unrelated problems to identifying reflectionless potentials of an auxiliary
one-dimensional quantum scattering problem. There are several ways of
constructing these potentials, one of which is quantum mechanical supersymmetry
(SUSY). In this paper, motivated by recent experimental platforms, we
generalize this framework to develop a theory of solitons in lattice versions
of interacting field theories. Our analysis hinges on the use of trace
identities, which are relations connecting the potential of an equation of
motion to the scattering data. For a discrete Schr\""odinger operator, such
trace identities are well known, and we derive a new set of identities for the
discrete Dirac operator. We then use these in a lattice Gross-Neveu and chiral
Gross-Neveu (Nambu-Jona-Lasinio) model to show that lattice solitons correspond
to reflectionless potentials associated with the discrete scattering problem.
These models are of significance as they are equivalent to a mean-field theory
of a lattice superconductor. To explicitly construct these solitons, we
generalize supersymmetric quantum mechanics to tight-binding models. We show
that a matrix transformation exists that maps a tight-binding model to an
isospectral one which shares the same structure and scattering properties. The
corresponding soliton solutions have both modulated hopping and onsite
potential; we explicitly compute both topological and non-topological soliton
solutions as well as bound state spectra in the aforementioned models.

Hall effect in the cuprates, we present an analysis of chiral phonon transport.
We assume the chiral behavior arises from a non-zero phonon Hall vicosity,
which is likely induced by the coupling to electrons. Phonons with a non-zero
phonon Hall viscosity have an intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity, but Chen et
al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 167601 (2020)) have argued that a significantly
larger thermal Hall conductivity can arise from an extrinsic contribution which
is inversely proportional to the density of impurities. We solve the Boltzmann
equation for phonon transport and compute the temperature ($T$) dependence of
the thermal Hall conductivity originating from skew scattering off point-like
impurities. We find that the dominant source for thermal Hall transport is an
interference between impurity skew scattering channels with opposite parity.
The thermal Hall conductivity $\sim T^{d+2}$ at low $T$ in $d$ dimensions, and
has a window of $T$-independent behavior for $T > T_{\rm imp}$, where $T_{\rm
imp}$ is determined by the ratio of scattering potentials with opposite parity.
We also consider the role of non-specular scattering off the sample boundary,
and find that it leads to negligible corrections to thermal Hall transport at
low $T$.

been derived from measuring lags in their varying light output at different
wavelengths. In principle, infrared data would reach to larger radii,
potentially even probing reprocessed radiation in any surrounding dusty torus.
In practice, this has proved challenging because high quality data are required
to detect such variability, and the observations must stretch over a long
period to probe the likely month-scale lags in variability. In addition, large
numbers of sources would need to be observed to start searching for any
patterns in such lags. Here, we show that the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey, built
up from repeated observations over almost a decade, provides an ideal data set
for such a study. For 94 sources identified as strongly-varying AGN within its
square-degree field, we find that the K-band light curves systematically lag
the J-band light curves by an average of around a month. The lags become
smaller at higher redshift, consistent with the band shift to optical
rest-frame emission. The less luminous AGN also display shorter lags, as would
be expected if their physical size scales with luminosity.

the loss of magnetic correlations, thereby giving rise to two quantum critical
points. The emergent non-Fermi liquid metal is governed by resilient
quasiparticles, that survive as the relevant low energy excitations even after
the break down of the Fermi liquid description. The transport and spectroscopic

between quantum and thermal fluctuations, emerging in the low-temperature
limit. In this review, we first give a pedagogical introduction to the
equilibrium behavior of systems in that context, whose scaling framework is
essentially developed by exploiting the quantum-to-classical mapping and the
renormalization-group theory of critical phenomena at continuous phase
transitions. Then we specialize to protocols entailing the out-of-equilibrium
quantum dynamics, such as instantaneous quenches and slow passages across
quantum transitions. These are mostly discussed within dynamic scaling
frameworks, obtained by appropriately extending the equilibrium scaling laws.
We review phenomena at first-order quantum transitions as well, whose peculiar
scaling behaviors are characterized by an extreme sensitivity to the boundary
conditions, giving rise to exponentials or power laws for the same bulk system.
In the last part, we cover aspects related to the effects of dissipative
interactions with an environment, through suitable generalizations of the
dynamic scaling at quantum transitions. The presentation is limited to issues
related to, and controlled by, the quantum transition developed by closed
many-body systems, treating the dissipation as a perturbation of the critical
regimes, as for the temperature at the zero-temperature quantum transition. We
focus on the physical conditions giving rise to a nontrivial interplay between
critical modes and various dissipative mechanisms, generally realized when the
involved mechanism excites only the low-energy modes of the quantum
transitions.

their origins and current nature. Two predominant mechanisms are orbital
migration, which brings them close to their star, and atmospheric escape under
the resulting increased irradiation. Yet, their relative roles remain unclear
because we lack models that couple the two mechanisms with high precision on
secular timescales. To address this need, we developed the JADE code, which
simulates the secular atmospheric and dynamical evolution of a planet around
its star, and can include the perturbation induced by a distant third body. On
the dynamical side, the 3D evolution of the orbit is modeled under stellar and
planetary tidal forces, a relativistic correction, and the action of the
distant perturber. On the atmospheric side, the vertical structure of the
atmosphere is integrated over time based on its thermodynamical properties,
inner heating, and the evolving stellar irradiation, which results, in
particular, in photo-evaporation. The JADE code is benchmarked on GJ436 b,
prototype of evaporating giants on eccentric, misaligned orbits at the edge of
the hot Neptunes desert. We confirm that its orbital architecture is well
explained by Kozai migration and unveil a strong interplay between its
atmospheric and orbital evolution. During the resonance phase, the atmosphere
pulsates in tune with the Kozai cycles, which leads to stronger tides and an
earlier migration. This triggers a strong evaporation several Gyr after the
planet formed, refining the paradigm that mass loss is dominant in the early
age of close-in planets. This suggests that the edge of the desert could be
formed of warm Neptunes whose evaporation was delayed by migration. It
strengthens the importance of coupling atmospheric and dynamical evolution over
secular timescales, which the JADE code will allow simulating for a wide range
of systems.

two-fold problem, existing approaches fall short as they only focus on either
homogenizing the gradient magnitude across tasks; or greedily change the

RotoGrad, an algorithm that tackles negative transfer as a whole: it jointly
homogenizes gradient magnitudes and directions, while ensuring training
convergence. We show that RotoGrad outperforms competing methods in complex

overwhelming probability under the time evolution of Hamiltonians featuring a

Physical properties of phases and phase transitions are typically retrieved via
simple correlation functions, that are related to observable response
functions. Recent experiments have demonstrated capabilities to fully
characterize quantum many-body systems via wave-function snapshots, opening new
possibilities to analyze quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce a method to data
mine the correlation structure of quantum partition functions via their path
integral (or equivalently, stochastic series expansion) manifold. We
characterize path-integral manifolds generated via state-of-the-art Quantum
Monte Carlo methods utilizing the intrinsic dimension (ID) and the variance of
distances from nearest neighbors (NN): the former is related to dataset
complexity, while the latter is able to diagnose connectivity features of
points in configuration space. We show how these properties feature universal
patterns in the vicinity of quantum criticality, that reveal how data
structures {\it simplify} systematically at quantum phase transitions. This is
further reflected by the fact that both ID and variance of NN-distances exhibit
universal scaling behavior in the vicinity of second-order and
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical points. Finally, we show how
non-Abelian symmetries dramatically influence quantum data sets, due to the
nature of (non-commuting) conserved charges in the quantum case. Complementary
to neural network representations, our approach represents a first, elementary
step towards a systematic characterization of path integral manifolds before
any dimensional reduction is taken, that is informative about universal
behavior and complexity, and can find immediate application to both experiments

community as it recovers promising high-order methods through modally filtered
correction fields, such as the discontinuous Galerkin method, amongst others,
on unstructured grids over complex geometries. Moreover, FR schemes,
specifically energy stable FR (ESFR) schemes also known as
Vincent-Castonguay-Jameson-Huynh schemes, have proven attractive as they allow
for design flexibility as well as stability proofs for the linear advection
problem on affine elements. Additionally, split forms have recently seen a
resurgence in research activity due to their resultant nonlinear (entropy)
stability proofs. This paper derives for the first time nonlinearly stable ESFR
schemes in split form that enable nonlinear stability proofs for, uncollocated,
modal, ESFR split forms with different volume and surface cubature nodes. The
critical enabling technology is applying the splitting to the discrete
stiffness operator. This naturally leads to appropriate surface and numerical
fluxes, enabling both entropy stability and conservation proofs. When these
schemes are recast in strong form, they differ from schemes found in the ESFR
literature as the ESFR correction functions are incorporated on the volume
integral. Furthermore, numerical experiments are conducted verifying that the
new class of proposed ESFR split forms is nonlinearly stable in contrast to the
standard split form ESFR approach. Lastly, the new ESFR split form is shown to
obtain the correct orders of accuracy.

learning: for example, they can help an agent generalize from past experience
to new goals, and they have been proposed as explanations of behavioral and

between model-based and model-free RL methods: like the former they make
predictions about future experiences, and like the latter they allow efficient
prediction of total discounted rewards. However, successor-style
representations are not optimized to generalize across policies: typically, we
maintain a limited-length list of policies, and share information among them by
representation learning or GPI. Successor-style representations also typically
make no provision for gathering information or reasoning about latent
variables. To address these limitations, we bring together ideas from
predictive state representations, belief space value iteration, successor
features, and convex analysis: we develop a new, general successor-style
representation, together with a Bellman equation that connects multiple sources
of information within this representation, including different latent states,
policies, and reward functions. The new representation is highly expressive:
for example, it lets us efficiently read off an optimal policy for a new reward
function, or a policy that imitates a new demonstration. For this paper, we
focus on exact computation of the new representation in small, known
environments, since even this restricted setting offers plenty of interesting
questions. Our implementation does not scale to large, unknown environments --
nor would we expect it to, since it generalizes POMDP value iteration, which is
difficult to scale. However, we believe that future work will allow us to
extend our ideas to approximate reasoning in large, unknown environments.

numerical experiments. In our model, the jets are generated in a sheared
magnetic arcade above a parasitic bipolar region located in one of the
footpoints of the filament channel (FC) supporting the prominence. The shear is
imposed with velocities not far above observed photospheric values; it leads to
a multiple reconnection process, as in previous jet models. Both a fast
Alfv\'enic perturbation and a slower supersonic front preceding a plasma jet
are issued from the reconnection site; in the later phase, a more violent
(eruptive) jet is produced. The perturbation and jets run along the FC; they
are partially reflected at the prominence and partially transmitted through it.
There results a pattern of counter-streaming flows along the FC and
oscillations of the prominence. The oscillations are LAOs (with amplitude above
$10~\mathrm{km\, s^{-1}}$) in parts of the prominence both in the longitudinal
and transverse directions. In some field lines, the impact is so strong that
the prominence mass is brought out of the dip and down to the chromosphere
along the FC. Two cases are studied with different heights of the arcade above
the parasitic bipolar region, leading to different heights for the region of
the prominence perturbed by the jets. The obtained oscillation amplitudes and
periods are in general agreement with the observations.

a clustering consistency condition to be satisfied jointly by both instance
visual similarities and cluster decision boundaries, and concurrently
optimising both to reason about the hypotheses of semantic ground-truth classes

learning approach to discovering unknown class decision boundaries has
considerable advantages to unsupervised learning of object recognition tasks.

rich protoplanetary disks provide key insights into the physics of star and
planet formation. When viewed edge-on, high resolution images offer a unique
opportunity to study both the radial and vertical structures of these disks and
relate this to vertical settling, radial drift, grain growth, and changes in
the midplane temperatures. In this work, we present multi-epoch HST and Keck
scattered light images, and an ALMA 1.3 mm continuum map for the remarkably
flat edge-on protoplanetary disk SSTC2DJ163131.2-242627, a young solar-type
star in $\rho$ Ophiuchus. We model the 0.8 $\mu$m and 1.3 mm images in separate
MCMC runs to investigate the geometry and dust properties of the disk using the
MCFOST radiative transfer code. In scattered light, we are sensitive to the
smaller dust grains in the surface layers of the disk, while the sub-millimeter
dust continuum observations probe larger grains closer to the disk midplane. An
MCMC run combining both datasets using a covariance-based log-likelihood
estimation was marginally successful, implying insufficient complexity in our
disk model. The disk is well characterized by a flared disk model with an
exponentially tapered outer edge viewed nearly edge-on, though some degree of
dust settling is required to reproduce the vertically thin profile and lack of
apparent flaring. A colder than expected disk midplane, evidence for dust
settling, and residual radial substructures all point to a more complex radial
density profile to be probed with future, higher resolution observations.

away as both the submillimeter continuum and the optical scattered light. CO is
detected from two surface layers separated by a midplane region in which CO
emission is suppressed, as expected from freeze-out in the cold midplane. We
apply a modified version of the Topographically Reconstructed Distribution

the disk. We find a temperature in the CO-emitting layers and the midplane of

nearly vertically isothermal profile. The transition in CO temperature
coincides with a dramatic reduction in the sub-micron and sub-millimeter
emission from the disk. We interpret this as interstellar UV radiation
providing an additional source of heating to the outer part of the disk.

thereby destroying the claimed security completely. Our second attack further
exploits the extremely sparse structure of the predicate $P_5$ and combines

improve performance with respect to a selection criterion. Theoretical results
exist that provide performance bounds and enable ""lazy greedy"" efficient
implementations for selection criteria that satisfy a diminishing returns
property known as submodularity. This has motivated the development of variable
selection algorithms based on mutual information and frame potential. Recently,
the authors introduced Forward Selection Component Analysis (FSCA) which uses
variance explained as its selection criterion. While this criterion is not
submodular, FSCA has been shown to be highly effective for applications such as
measurement plan optimisation. In this paper a ""lazy"" implementation of the
FSCA algorithm (L-FSCA) is proposed, which, although not equivalent to FSCA due
to the absence of submodularity, has the potential to yield comparable
performance while being up to an order of magnitude faster to compute. The
efficacy of L-FSCA is demonstrated by performing a systematic comparison with
FSCA and five other unsupervised variable selection methods from the literature
using simulated and real-world case studies. Experimental results confirm that
L-FSCA yields almost identical performance to FSCA while reducing computation
time by between 22% and 94% for the case studies considered.

equation shows that, assuming the detector is in the transverse-traceless
frame, which has a local shearing relative motion due to the gravitational wave
perturbations, the electric field does not propagate as in an inertial
reference frame in Minkowski spacetime. We present the electric field at the
end of the interferometric process, for arbitrary arm configurations with
respect to the plane gravitational wave packet propagation direction. Then, for
normal incidence, we compute the interference pattern and, in addition to the
usual term associated with the difference in path traveled by light in the
arms, we deduce two new contributions to the final intensity, arising from: (i)
the round-trip electromagnetic frequency shift and (ii) the divergence of the
light beam. Their quantitative relevance is compared to the traditional
contribution and shown to be typically negligible due to the geometrical optics
regime of light. Moreover, a non-parallel transport of the polarization vector
takes place, in general, because of the gravitational wave, a feature which
could generate further contributions. However, we conclude that for the normal
incidence case such vector is parallel transported, preventing this kind of
correction.

biosignatures in Earth's atmosphere remains uncertain, particularly for the

examine the likely timescale of oxygen-rich atmospheric conditions on Earth.
Using a stochastic approach, we find that the mean future lifespan of Earth's
atmosphere with oxygen levels more than 1% of the present atmospheric level is
1.08+-0.14 billion years. The model projects that a deoxygenation of the
atmosphere, with atmospheric oxygen dropping sharply to levels reminiscnet of
the Archaean Earth, will most probably be triggered before the inception of
moist greenhouse conditions in Earth's climate system and before the extensive
loss of surface water from the atmosphere. We find that future deoxygenation is
an inevitable consequence of increasing solar fluxes, whereas its precise
timing is modulated by the exchange flux of reducing power between the mantle
and the ocean-atmosphere-crust system. Our results suggest that the planetary
carbonate-silicate cycle will tend to lead to terminally CO2-limited biospheres
and rapid atmospheric deoxygenation, emphasizing the need for robust
atmospheric biosignatures applicable to weakly oxygenated and anoxic exoplanet

advancement across a wide variety of semi-supervised node classification tasks.
Despite their great success, training GCNs on large graphs suffers from
computational and memory issues. A potential path to circumvent these obstacles
is sampling-based methods, where at each layer a subset of nodes is sampled.
Although recent studies have empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of
sampling-based methods, these works lack theoretical convergence guarantees
under realistic settings and cannot fully leverage the information of evolving
parameters during optimization. In this paper, we describe and analyze a
general doubly variance reduction schema that can accelerate any sampling
method under the memory budget. The motivating impetus for the proposed schema
is a careful analysis of the variance of sampling methods where it is shown
that the induced variance can be decomposed into node embedding approximation
variance (zeroth-order variance) during forward propagation and
layerwise-gradient variance (first-order variance) during backward propagation.
We theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed schema and show that
it enjoys an $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate. We complement our theoretical
results by integrating the proposed schema in different sampling methods and
applying them to different large real-world graphs.

gerrymandering; the main idea is to generate a large, random sample of
districting plans (an ""ensemble"") to which any proposed plan may be compared.
If a proposed plan is an extreme outlier compared to the ensemble with regard
to various redistricting criteria, this may indicate that the plan was
deliberately engineered to produce a specific outcome.
  Many methods have been used to construct ensembles, and a fundamental
question that arises is: Given a method for constructing plans, can we identify
a probability distribution on the space of plans that describes the probability
of constructing any particular plan by that method?
  Recently, MCMC methods have become a predominant tool for constructing
ensembles. Here we focus on the MCMC method known as ""ReCom,"" which was
introduced in 2018 by the MGGG Redistricting Lab. ReCom tends to produce plans
with more compact districts than some other methods, and we sought to better
understand this phenomenon. We adopted a discrete analog of district perimeter
called ""cut edges"" as a quantitative measure for district compactness; this
measure was proposed by Duchin and Tenner, and it avoids some of the
difficulties associated with compactness measures based on geographic
perimeter, such as the Polsby-Popper score.
  To model the basic ReCom step, we constructed ensembles of 2-district plans
for two grid graphs and for the precinct graph of Boulder County, CO. We found
that the probability of sampling any particular plan -- which is roughly
proportional to the product of the numbers of spanning trees for each of the
two districts -- is also approximately proportional to an exponentially
decaying function of the number of cut edges in the plan. This is an important
step towards understanding compactness properties for districting plans
produced by the ReCom method.

PDF files are commonly used by attackers. Our approach to detect which software
has been used to produce a PDF file is based on coding style: given patterns
that are only created by certain PDF producers. We have analyzed the coding
style of 900 PDF files produced using 11 PDF producers on 3 different Operating
Systems. We have obtained a set of 192 rules which can be used to identify 11
PDF producers. We have tested our detection tool on 508836 PDF files published

able to apply our tool to identify how online PDF services work and to spot

target sound source in a different manner from the normal hearing (NH)
individuals during a conversation. This study attempted to investigate the
effect of conversational sound levels on the mechanisms adopted by CI and NH
listeners in selective auditory attention and how it affects their daily
conversation. Nine CI users (five bilateral, three unilateral, and one bimodal)
and eight NH listeners participated in this study. The behavioral speech
recognition scores were collected using a matrix sentences test and neural
tracking to speech envelope was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG).
Speech stimuli were presented at three different levels (75, 65, and 55 dB SPL)
in the presence of two maskers from three spatially separated speakers.
Different combinations of assisted/impaired hearing modes were evaluated for CI
users and the outcomes were analyzed in three categories: electric hearing
only, acoustic hearing only, and electric+acoustic hearing. Our results showed
that increasing the conversational sound level degraded the selective auditory
attention in electrical hearing. On the other hand, increasing the sound level
improved the selective auditory attention for the acoustic hearing group. In NH
listeners, however, increasing the sound level did not cause a significant
change in the auditory attention. Our result implies that the effect of the
sound level on the selective auditory attention varies depending on hearing
modes and the loudness control is necessary for the ease of attending to the
conversation by CI users.

characteristic active-region lifetime is 694 days. Adding a planet to the RV
model produces a best-fit orbital period of 100~years, or 10 times the

dynamical systems is mostly intractable. In consequence, a number of
approximation methods have been developed. However, none of the current methods
can quantify by how much the resulting control underperforms the elusive
globally optimal solution. Here we propose policy decomposition, an
approximation method with explicit suboptimality estimates. Our method
decomposes the optimal control problem into lower-dimensional subproblems,
whose optimal solutions are recombined to build a control policy for the entire
system. Many such combinations exist, and we introduce the value error and its
LQR and DDP estimates to predict the suboptimality of possible combinations and
prioritize the ones that minimize it. Using a cart-pole, a 3-link balancing
biped and N-link planar manipulators as example systems, we find that the
estimates correctly identify the best combinations, yielding control policies
in a fraction of the time it takes to compute the optimal control without a
notable sacrifice in closed-loop performance. While more research will be
needed to find ways of dealing with the combinatorics of policy decomposition,
the results suggest this method could be an effective alternative for
approximating optimal control in intractable systems.

approach to Bayesian inference on latent Gaussian models (LGMs) and focuses on
fast and accurate approximation of posterior marginals for the parameters in
the models. Recently, methods have been developed to extend this class of
models to those that can be expressed as conditional LGMs by fixing some of the
parameters in the models to descriptive values. These methods differ in the
manner descriptive values are chosen. This paper proposes to combine importance
sampling with INLA (IS-INLA), and extends this approach with the more robust
adaptive multiple importance sampling algorithm combined with INLA (AMIS-INLA).
  This paper gives a comparison between these approaches and existing methods
on a series of applications with simulated and observed datasets and evaluates
their performance based on accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. The approaches
are validated by exact posteriors in a simple bivariate linear model; then,
they are applied to a Bayesian lasso model, a Bayesian imputation of missing
covariate values, and lastly, in parametric Bayesian quantile regression. The
applications show that the AMIS-INLA approach, in general, outperforms the
other methods, but the IS-INLA algorithm could be considered for faster

syndrome-like coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread worldwide and as of early 2021,
continues to significantly impact most countries. Only a small number of
coronaviruses are known to infect humans, and only two are associated with the
severe outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus, a closely related species of SARS-CoV-2 that
emerged in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,
which emerged in 2012. Both of these previous epidemics were controlled fairly
rapidly through public health measures, and no vaccines or robust therapeutic
interventions were identified. However, previous insights into the immune
response to coronaviruses gained during the outbreaks of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have
proved beneficial to identifying approaches to the treatment and prophylaxis of
novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A number of potential therapeutics
against SARS-CoV-2 and the resultant COVID-19 illness were rapidly identified,
leading to a large number of clinical trials investigating a variety of
possible therapeutic approaches being initiated early on in the pandemic. As a
result, a small number of therapeutics have already been authorized by
regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the
United States, and many other therapeutics remain under investigation. Here, we
describe a range of approaches for the treatment of COVID-19, along with their
proposed mechanisms of action and the current status of clinical investigation
into each candidate. The status of these investigations will continue to
evolve, and this review will be updated as progress is made.

the time-dependent Boltzmann equation are applied to the high-order RTE,
discretized in time with the backward Euler (BE) scheme. The high-dimensional

means of the low-rank proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Another version of
the presented method applies the POD to the remainder term of P2 expansion of

typically hand-coded, and preference-based learning is used to determine a
particular user's relative weighting for each feature. Designing a
representative set of features to encode reward is challenging and can result
in inaccurate models that fail to model the users' preferences or perform the
task properly. In this paper, we present a method to learn both the relative

user's reward function. The additional features are modeled as a neural network
that is trained on the data from pairwise comparison queries. We apply our
methods to a driving scenario used in previous work and compare the predictive
power of our method to that of only hand-coded features. We perform additional
analysis to interpret the learned features and examine the optimal
trajectories. Our results show that adding an additional learned feature to the
reward model enhances both its predictive power and expressiveness, producing
unique results for each user.

variations around the outbreak can be interpreted as outliers, as shifts to the
distribution of existing shocks, or as addition of new shocks. I take the
latter view and use covid indicators as controls to 'de-covid' the data prior
to estimation. I find that economic uncertainty remains high at the end of 2020
even though real economic activity has recovered and covid uncertainty has
receded. Dynamic responses of variables to shocks in a VAR similar in magnitude
and shape to the ones identified before 2020 can be recovered by directly or
indirectly modeling covid and treating it as exogenous. These responses to
economic shocks are distinctly different from those to a covid shock which are
much larger but shorter lived. Disentangling the two types of shocks can be
important in macroeconomic modeling post-covid.

study the SFHs of satellites of Milky Way-like galaxies in a cosmological
context: while in the majority of the cases the accretion onto their host
galaxy causes the satellites to lose their gas, with a subsequent suppression
in SF, in about 25$\%$ of our sample we observe a clear enhancement of SF after
infall. Peaks in SF clearly correlate with the satellite pericentric passage
around its host and, in one case, with a satellite-satellite interaction. We
identify two key ingredients that result in enhanced SF after infall: galaxies
must enter the host's virial radius with a reservoir of cold gas $M_{\rm
gas,inf}/M_{\rm vir,inf}\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ and with a minimum pericentric
distance $\gtrsim$10 kpc (mean distance $\sim$50 kpc for the full sample), in
order to form new stars due to compression of cold gas at pericentric passage.
On the other hand, satellites that infall with little gas or whose pericentric
distance is too small, have their gas ram-pressure stripped and subsequent SF
quenched. The pericentric passage of satellites likewise correlates with SF
peaks in their hosts, suggesting that this mechanism induces bursts of SF in
satellites and central galaxies alike, in agreement with recent studies of our
Galaxy's SFH. Our findings can explain the recently reported multiple stellar
populations observed in dwarf galaxies such as Carina and Fornax, and should be
taken into account in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and satellite

higher its transmit symbol power is. To strike a balance between energy
harvesting and energy consumption, we formulate two constrained optimization
problems (P1) and (P2), where in both problems we seek the jointly optimal
local decision thresholds and channel gain quantization thresholds. While in
(P1) we maximize the Jdivergence of the received signal densities at the FC, in
(P2) we minimize the average total transmit power, subject to certain
constraints. We solve (P1) and (P2), assuming that the batteries reach their
steady-state. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
optimization on enhancing the detection performance in (P1), and lowering the
average total transmit power in (P2). They also reveal how the energy
harvesting rate, the battery size, the sensor observation and communication
channel parameters impact obtained solutions.

as a metric of a discrepancy between a particular pixel of an image and its

on a small amount of statistical information stored in memory, thus resulting
in a very computationally efficient (processor- and memory-wise) method. The

of Periodic Geometry and Topology for materials applications.Periodic
structures such as solid crystalline materials or textiles were previously
classified in discrete and coarse ways that depend on manual choices or are
unstable under perturbations. Since crystal structures are determined in a
rigid form, their finest natural equivalence is defined by rigid motion or
isometry, which preserves inter-point distances. Due to atomic vibrations,
isometry classes of periodic point sets form a continuous space whose geometry
and topology were unknown. The key new problem in Periodic Geometry is to
unambiguously parameterize this space of isometry classes by continuous
coordinates that allow a complete reconstruction of any crystal. The major part
of this manuscript reviews the recently developed isometry invariants to
resolve the above problem: (1) density functions computed from higher order
Voronoi zones, (2) distance-based invariants that allow ultra-fast
visualizations of huge crystal datasets, and (3) the complete invariant isoset
(a DNA-type code) with a first continuous metric on all periodic crystals. The
main goal of Periodic Topology is to classify textiles up to periodic isotopy,
which is a continuous deformation of a thickened plane without a fixed lattice
basis. This practical problem substantially differs from past research focused
on links in a fixed thickened torus.

production (CEP) events, pp $\to$ pXp, at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) by
means of a new near-beam proton spectrometer. In CEP events, the state X is
produced at central rapidities, and the scattered protons do not leave the beam
pipe. The kinematics of X can be fully reconstructed from that of the protons,
which gives access to final states otherwise not visible. CEP allows unique
sensitivity to physics beyond the standard model, e.g. in the search for
anomalous quartic gauge couplings, axion-like particles, and in general new
resonances. CMS has been successfully operating the Precision Proton
Spectrometer (PPS), initially a joint CMS and TOTEM project, since 2016. The
present document outlines the physics interest of a new PPS at the HL-LHC, and
explores its feasibility and expected performance. Discussions with the machine
groups led to the identification of four locations suitable for the
installation of movable proton detectors: at 196, 220, 234, and 420 m from the
interaction point, on both sides. Acceptance studies indicate that having the
beams cross in the vertical plane at the interaction point, as implemented
after Long Shutdown 3, is preferable over the present horizontal crossing. This
gives access to states X in the mass range 133 GeV$-$2.7 TeV with the stations
at 196, 220, and 234 m. The lower mass limit becomes 43 GeV if the 420 m
station is included, which makes it possible to study central exclusive
production of the 125 GeV Higgs boson. This is a major improvement with respect
to the current mass range of 350 GeV$-$2 TeV. The project and its costs can
easily be staged; the 420 m station can be addressed in a second step. In
summary, a new near-beam proton spectrometer for operation at the HL-LHC
appears feasible. It would greatly extend the CMS physics reach with a limited
investment.

property of agents' preferences and their information. When required to hold
for all preferences, it is equivalent to information having ""unbounded

even if only with small probability. But unbounded beliefs may be untenable
with more than two states: e.g., it is incompatible with the monotone
likelihood ratio property. Excludability reveals that what is crucial for
learning, instead, is that a single agent must be able to rule out any wrong
action, even if she cannot take the correct action. Consequently, excludability
helps study classes of preferences and information that mutually ensure
learning. We develop two such pairs: (i) for a one-dimensional state,

directionally unbounded beliefs; and (ii) for a multi-dimensional state,

weather conditions presents a significant challenge to object detection
algorithms, and thus it is imperative to test the vehicle extensively in all
conditions which it may experience. However, development of robust autonomous
vehicle subsystems requires repeatable, controlled testing - while real weather
is unpredictable and cannot be scheduled. Real-world testing in adverse
conditions is an expensive and time-consuming task, often requiring access to
specialist facilities. Simulation is commonly relied upon as a substitute, with
increasingly visually realistic representations of the real-world being
developed. In the context of the complete autonomous vehicle control pipeline,
subsystems downstream of perception need to be tested with accurate recreations
of the perception system output, rather than focusing on subjective visual

theoretically and with synthetic experiments that for well-specified models,
labeled points are worth a constant factor more than unlabeled points. With
misspecification, however, their relative value is higher due to the additional
bias but can be reduced with correction. We also apply our approach to study
real-world weak supervision techniques for dataset construction.

empirical comparisons of FL and SL in real-world IoT settings regarding (i)
learning performance with heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) on-device
execution overhead. Our analyses in this work demonstrate that the learning
performance of SL is better than FL under an imbalanced data distribution but
worse than FL under an extreme non-IID data distribution. Recently, FL and SL
are combined to form splitfed learning (SFL) to leverage each of their benefits
(e.g., parallel training of FL and lightweight on-device computation
requirement of SL). This work then considers FL, SL, and SFL, and mount them on
Raspberry Pi devices to evaluate their performance, including training time,
communication overhead, power consumption, and memory usage. Besides
evaluations, we apply two optimizations. Firstly, we generalize SFL by
carefully examining the possibility of a hybrid type of model training at the
server-side. The generalized SFL merges sequential (dependent) and parallel
(independent) processes of model training and is thus beneficial for a system
with large-scaled IoT devices, specifically at the server-side operations.
Secondly, we propose pragmatic techniques to substantially reduce the
communication overhead by up to four times for the SL and (generalized) SFL.

heterogeneously on dislocations and experience accelerated growth due to Nb

a ferrimagnetic transition at 78 K. The resistivity drops by 7 orders of
magnitude with an applied magnetic field above 9 Tesla, leading to an

analysis of time series data with applications in various areas including
economics, molecular biology, and neuroscience. Two of the main challenges of
this methodology are: 1) over-fitting as a result of limited data duration, and
2) correlated process noise as a confounding factor, both leading to errors in
identifying the causal influences. Sparse estimation via the LASSO has
successfully addressed these challenges for parameter estimation. However, the
classical statistical tests for Granger causality resort to asymptotic analysis
of ordinary least squares, which require long data durations to be useful and
are not immune to confounding effects. In this work, we close this gap by
introducing a LASSO-based statistic and studying its non-asymptotic properties
under the assumption that the true models admit sparse autoregressive
representations. We establish that the sufficient conditions of LASSO also
suffice for robust identification of Granger causal influences. We also
characterize the false positive error probability of a simple thresholding rule
for identifying Granger causal effects. We present simulation studies and
application to real data to compare the performance of the ordinary least
squares and LASSO in detecting Granger causal influences, which corroborate our
theoretical results.

summarizing their information along the inference layers to derive the final
decision. Because of this, they are prone to adversarial attacks. Small
sophisticated noise in the input images can accumulate along the network
inference path and produce wrong decisions at the network output. On the other
hand, human eyes recognize objects based on their global structure and semantic
cues, instead of local image textures. Because of this, human eyes can still
clearly recognize objects from images which have been heavily damaged by
adversarial attacks. This leads to a very interesting approach for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose to
develop a structure-preserving progressive low-rank image completion (SPLIC)
method to remove unneeded texture details from the input images and shift the
bias of deep neural networks towards global object structures and semantic
cues. We formulate the problem into a low-rank matrix completion problem with
progressively smoothed rank functions to avoid local minimums during the
optimization process. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method is able to successfully remove the insignificant local image details
while preserving important global object structures. On black-box, gray-box,

  Visual Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning feature representation from discriminative local regions plays a key
role in fine-grained visual classification. Employing attention mechanisms to
extract part features has become a trend. However, there are two major
limitations in these methods: First, they often focus on the most salient part
while neglecting other inconspicuous but distinguishable parts. Second, they
treat different part features in isolation while neglecting their
relationships. To handle these limitations, we propose to locate multiple
different distinguishable parts and explore their relationships in an explicit
way. In this pursuit, we introduce two lightweight modules that can be easily
plugged into existing convolutional neural networks. On one hand, we introduce
a feature boosting and suppression module that boosts the most salient part of
feature maps to obtain a part-specific representation and suppresses it to
force the following network to mine other potential parts. On the other hand,
we introduce a feature diversification module that learns semantically
complementary information from the correlated part-specific representations.
Our method does not need bounding boxes/part annotations and can be trained
end-to-end. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performances on several benchmark fine-grained datasets.

  Optimization: Asynchrony and Inexactness",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dual decomposition is widely utilized in distributed optimization of
multi-agent systems. In practice, the dual decomposition algorithm is desired
to admit an asynchronous implementation due to imperfect communication, such as
time delay and packet drop. In addition, computational errors also exist when
individual agents solve their own subproblems. In this paper, we analyze the
convergence of the dual decomposition algorithm in distributed optimization
when both the asynchrony in communication and the inexactness in solving
subproblems exist. We find that the interaction between asynchrony and
inexactness slows down the convergence rate from $\mathcal{O} ( 1 / k )$ to
$\mathcal{O} ( 1 / \sqrt{k} )$. Specifically, with a constant step size, the
value of objective function converges to a neighborhood of the optimal value,
and the solution converges to a neighborhood of the exact optimal solution.
Moreover, the violation of the constraints diminishes in $\mathcal{O} ( 1 /
\sqrt{k} )$. Our result generalizes and unifies the existing ones that only
consider either asynchrony or inexactness. Finally, numerical simulations
validate the theoretical results.

is applicable to various wireless scenarios, including full-duplex wireless

can saturate the receiver's analog-to-digital converters (ADC), they need to be
mitigated both before and after the ADCs, i.e., via hybrid processing. The key
idea of the proposed scheme, namely the Hybrid Interference Mitigation using
Analog Prewhitening (HIMAP), is to insert an M-input M-output analog phase
shifter network (PSN) between the receive antennas and the ADCs to spatially
prewhiten the interferences, which requires no signal information but only an
estimate of the covariance matrix. After interference mitigation by the PSN
prewhitener, the preamble can be synchronized, the signal channel response can
be estimated, and thus a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) beamformer can be
applied in the digital domain to further mitigate the residual interferences.
The simulation results verify that the HIMAP scheme can suppress interferences
80dB stronger than the signal by using off-the-shelf phase shifters (PS) of
6-bit resolution.

for various Reynolds numbers. It is seen that the angles of the walls play an
active role in disrupting the symmetry of flow. For non-parallel walls, the
symmetry breaking bifurcation phenomenon no longer exists and the loss of
symmetry is a gradual process. The effect of asymmetry of geometry on flow is
also studied by considering two types of asymmetry - First type is at the plane
of expansion where the steps on either side are of unequal heights, while the
second one deals the walls of the channel are at a different inclination with
the direction of inflow. The present study reveals that small asymmetry impedes
the sharp transition and thus smoothens the pitchfork bifurcation. Increased
asymmetry finally leads to the unique solution of the governing Equations,

the flow separation and reduce the drag of a turbulent flow in a channel with
square bars. The transverse flow produces a maximum drag reduction of 25\%, due
to lower pressure and skin-friction drag forces. The pressure drag reduction
reaches a maximum of 22\% and is due to a decrease of the positive high
pressure in front of the bars and an increase of the low negative pressure
behind the bars. The skin-friction drag reduction is caused by a lower
wall-shear stress along the cavity between the bars where the flow is fully
attached, while the wall-shear stress on the crest of the bars and in the
separated region behind the bars is unaffected. The spanwise laminar flow
obtained by neglecting the nonlinear terms involving the turbulent velocity
fluctuations is used to compute the power spent for oscillating the fluid along
the spanwise direction and an excellent agreement is found with the power spent
obtained by the averaged turbulent flow. A marginal or negative net power saved
is found by subtracting the power employed for controlling the flow from the
power saved thanks to the transverse flow. The control reduces the total drag
as the integral of the Reynolds stresses along the horizontal line connecting
the corners of two consecutive bars is decreased, which in turn impacts on the

present the evolution of the gas density, solar illumination, helioglow source
function, and other relevant parameters building up the helioglow signal for
selected lines of sight observed at 1 au. We compare these elements for various
phases of the solar cycle and we present the sensitivity of the results to
heliolatitudinal anisotropy of the solar EUV output. We assume a realistic
latitudinal anisotropy of the solar wind flux using results from analysis of
interplanetary scintillations. We compare the simulated helioglow with with
selected maps observed by the SOHO/SWAN instrument. We demonstrate that
WawHelioGlow is able to reproduce fundamental features of the sky distribution
of the helioglow. For some phases of the solar cycle, the model with an
anisotropy of the solar EUV output better reproduces the observations, while
for other phases no EUV anisotropy is needed. In all simulated cases, the solar
wind anisotropy following insight from interplanetary scintillation
measurements is present.

percolation process, with parallels to phase transitions in theoretical

have not been directly observed in any social media. Here, through analysis of
100 million Weibo and 40 million Twitter users, we identify percolation-like
spread, and find that it happens more readily than current theoretical models

existence of positive feedback in the coevolution between network structure and
user activity level, such that more active users gain more followers. Moreover,
this coevolution induces an extreme imbalance in users' influence. Our findings

eroding due to the ongoing nuclear phaseout in Germany and the steady growth in

forces hydropower producers to recover part of their original profitability on
the reserve markets. We propose a bi-layer stochastic programming framework for
the optimal operation of a fleet of interconnected hydropower plants that sells
energy on both the spot and the reserve markets. The outer layer (the planner's
problem) optimizes end-of-day reservoir filling levels over one year, whereas
the inner layer (the trader's problem) selects optimal hourly market bids
within each day. Using an information restriction whereby the planner
prescribes the end-of-day reservoir targets one day in advance, we prove that
the trader's problem simplifies from an infinite-dimensional stochastic program
with 25 stages to a finite two-stage stochastic program with only two
scenarios. Substituting this reformulation back into the outer layer and
approximating the reservoir targets by affine decision rules allows us to
simplify the planner's problem from an infinite-dimensional stochastic program
with 365 stages to a two-stage stochastic program that can conveniently be
solved via the sample average approximation. Numerical experiments based on a

seamlessly integrate the underlying physics of the observed fluid flow and the

limited experimental data. In this hidden fluid mechanics paradigm, we train
the neural network by minimizing a loss function composed of a data mismatch
term and residual terms associated with the coupled Navier-Stokes and heat
transfer equations. We first quantify the accuracy of the proposed method based
on a 2D synthetic data set for buoyancy-driven flow, and subsequently apply it
to the Tomo-BOS data set, where we are able to infer the instantaneous velocity

independent PIV experiment to validate the PINN inference for the unsteady
velocity field at a center plane. To explain the observed flow physics, we also
perform systematic PINN simulations at different Reynolds and Richardson

physics, in particular via Stefan problems for heat conduction accompanied by a

biological invasion. For example, when a logistic growth term is added to the
governing partial differential equation in a Stefan problem, one arrives at the
Fisher-Stefan model, a generalisation of the well-known Fisher-KPP model,
characterised by a leakage coefficient $\kappa$ which relates the speed of the
moving boundary to the flux of population there. This Fisher-Stefan model
overcomes one of the well-known limitations of the Fisher-KPP model, since
time-dependent solutions of the Fisher-Stefan model involve a well-defined
front with compact support which is more natural in terms of mathematical
modelling. Almost all of the existing analysis of the standard Fisher-Stefan
model involves setting $\kappa > 0$, which can lead to either invading
travelling wave solutions or complete extinction of the population. Here, we
demonstrate how setting $\kappa < 0$ leads to retreating travelling waves and
an interesting transition to finite-time blow-up. For certain initial
conditions, population extinction is also observed. Our approach involves
studying time-dependent solutions of the governing equations, phase plane and
asymptotic analysis, leading to new insight into the possibilities of
travelling waves, blow-up and extinction for this moving boundary problem.

complex high-level mission specification given in the form of an Linear
Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. The state-of-the-art approach to this problem
employs the automata-theoretic model checking technique to solve this problem.
This approach involves computation of a product graph of the Buchi automaton
generated from the LTL specification and a joint transition system which
captures the collective motion of the robots and then computation of the
shortest path using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. We propose MT*, an
algorithm that reduces the computation burden for generating such plans for
multi-robot systems significantly. Our approach generates a reduced version of
the product graph without computing the complete joint transition system, which
is computationally expensive. It then divides the complete mission
specification among the participating robots and generates the trajectories for
the individual robots independently. Our approach demonstrates substantial
speedup in terms of computation time over the state-of-the-art approach, and
unlike the state of the art approach, scales well with both the number of
robots and the size of the workspace

rules in disjunctive normal form as an interpretable model for classification.
We consider the problem of learning an interpretable decision rule set as
training a neural network in a specific, yet very simple two-layer
architecture. Each neuron in the first layer directly maps to an interpretable
if-then rule after training, and the output neuron in the second layer directly
maps to a disjunction of the first-layer rules to form the decision rule set.
Our representation of neurons in this first rules layer enables us to encode
both the positive and the negative association of features in a decision rule.
State-of-the-art neural net training approaches can be leveraged for learning
highly accurate classification models. Moreover, we propose a sparsity-based
regularization approach to balance between classification accuracy and the
simplicity of the derived rules. Our experimental results show that our method
can generate more accurate decision rule sets than other state-of-the-art
rule-learning algorithms with better accuracy-simplicity trade-offs. Further,
when compared with uninterpretable black-box machine learning approaches such
as random forests and full-precision deep neural networks, our approach can
easily find interpretable decision rule sets that have comparable predictive
performance.

  Risk",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In order to model risk aversion in reinforcement learning, an emerging line
of research adapts familiar algorithms to optimize coherent risk functionals, a
class that includes conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Because optimizing the
coherent risk is difficult in Markov decision processes, recent work tends to
focus on the Markov coherent risk (MCR), a time-consistent surrogate. While,
policy gradient (PG) updates have been derived for this objective, it remains
unclear (i) whether PG finds a global optimum for MCR; (ii) how to estimate the
gradient in a tractable manner. In this paper, we demonstrate that, in general,
MCR objectives (unlike the expected return) are not gradient dominated and that
stationary points are not, in general, guaranteed to be globally optimal.
Moreover, we present a tight upper bound on the suboptimality of the learned
policy, characterizing its dependence on the nonlinearity of the objective and
the degree of risk aversion. Addressing (ii), we propose a practical
implementation of PG that uses state distribution reweighting to overcome
previous limitations. Through experiments, we demonstrate that when the
optimality gap is small, PG can learn risk-sensitive policies. However, we find
that instances with large suboptimality gaps are abundant and easy to
construct, outlining an important challenge for future research.

platforms are centered around using large-scale storage systems for storing and
retrieving data. In the presence of concurrent accesses, these storage systems
trade off isolation for performance. The weaker the isolation level, the more
behaviors a storage system is allowed to exhibit and it is up to the developer
to ensure that their application can tolerate those behaviors. However, these
weak behaviors only occur rarely in practice, that too outside the control of
the application, making it difficult for developers to test the robustness of
their code against weak isolation levels.
  This paper presents MonkeyDB, a mock storage system for testing
storage-backed applications. MonkeyDB supports a Key-Value interface as well as
SQL queries under multiple isolation levels. It uses a logical specification of
the isolation level to compute, on a read operation, the set of all possible
return values. MonkeyDB then returns a value randomly from this set. We show
that MonkeyDB provides good coverage of weak behaviors, which is complete in
the limit. We test a variety of applications for assertions that fail only
under weak isolation. MonkeyDB is able to break each of those assertions in a
small number of attempts.

games played on neutral courts and no traveling for teams, which in theory
removes home-court advantage from the games. This setting has attracted much
discussion as analysts and fans debated the possible effects it may have on the
outcome of games. Home-court advantage has historically played an influential
role in NBA playoff series outcomes. The 2020 playoff provided a unique
opportunity to study the effects of the bubble and home-court advantage by
comparing the 2020 season with the seasons in the past. While many factors
contribute to the outcome of games, points scored is the deciding factor of who
wins games, so scoring is the primary focus of this study. The specific
measures of interest are team scoring totals and team shooting percentage on
two-pointers, three-pointers, and free throws. Comparing these measures for
home teams and away teams in 2020 vs. 2017-2019 shows that the 2020 playoffs

application of agricultural robotics for which few end-to-end systems exist.
One of the biggest challenges in creating an autonomous pruning system is the
need to reconstruct a model of a tree which is accurate and informative enough
to be useful for deciding where to cut. One useful structure for modeling a
tree is a skeleton: a 1D, lightweight representation of the geometry and the
topology of a tree. This skeletonization problem is an important one within the
field of computer graphics, and a number of algorithms have been specifically
developed for the task of modeling trees. These skeletonization algorithms have
largely addressed the problem as a geometric one. In agricultural contexts,
however, the parts of the tree have distinct labels, such as the trunk,
supporting branches, etc. This labeled structure is important for understanding
where to prune. We introduce an algorithm which produces such a labeled
skeleton, using the topological and geometric priors associated with these
labels to improve our skeletons. We test our skeletonization algorithm on point
clouds from 29 upright fruiting offshoot (UFO) trees and demonstrate a median
accuracy of 70% with respect to a human-evaluated gold standard. We also make
point cloud scans of 82 UFO trees open-source to other researchers. Our work
represents a significant first step towards a robust tree modeling framework

variables, each variable being discrete, with the goal of characterizing the
possible distributions on outcomes that can result from controlling one of the
observed variables. We optimize linear functions over the space of all possible
interventional distributions, which allows us find properties of the
interventional distribution even when we cannot uniquely identify what it is.
We show that, under certain mild assumptions about the correlation between
controlled variable and the latent variable, the resulting interventional
distribution must be close to the observed conditional distribution in a
quantitative sense. Specifically, we show that if the observed variables are
sufficiently highly correlated, and the latent variable can only take on a
small number of distinct values, then the variables will remain causally
related after passing to the interventional distribution. Another result,
possibly of more general interest, is a bound on the distance between the
interventional distribution and the observed conditional distribution in terms
of the mutual information between the controlled variable and the latent
variable, which shows that the controlled variable and the latent variable must
be tightly correlated for the interventional distribution to differ
significantly from the observed distribution. We believe that this type of
result may make it possible to rigorously consider 'weak' experiments, where
the causal variable is not entirely independent from the environment, but only
approximately so. More generally, we suggest a connection between the theory of
causality to polynomial optimization, which give useful bounds on the space of

state estimator for path planning. Since the state estimation depends on the
vehicle's path, the path planning needs to consider the trade-off between
exploration and exploitation. We use a high-level decision-maker to choose an
explorative path or an exploitative path. The overall proposed framework
consists of an adaptive state estimator, a short-term path planner, and a
high-level decision-maker. We tested the framework with a spatiotemporal model
simulation where the state of each grid transits from normal, latent, and fire
state. For the mission objective of visiting the grids with fire, the proposed
framework outperformed the random walk (baseline) and the single-minded
exploitation (or exploration) path.

It employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn distinctive image

unrealistic segmentation results. In this paper, we present a fully automatic
deep learning method for robust medical image segmentation by formulating the
segmentation problem as a recurrent framework using two systems. The first one
is a forward system of an encoder-decoder CNN that predicts the segmentation
result from the input image. The predicted probabilistic output of the forward
system is then encoded by a fully convolutional network (FCN)-based context
feedback system. The encoded feature space of the FCN is then integrated back
into the forward system's feed-forward learning process. Using the FCN-based
context feedback loop allows the forward system to learn and extract more
high-level image features and fix previous mistakes, thereby improving
prediction accuracy over time. Experimental results, performed on four
different clinical datasets, demonstrate our method's potential application for
single and multi-structure medical image segmentation by outperforming the
state of the art methods. With the feedback loop, deep learning methods can now
produce results that are both anatomically plausible and robust to low contrast

Nevertheless, because of the intrinsic 2D-to-3D ambiguity, recovering
camera-space 3D information from a single RGB image remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we divide camera-space mesh recovery into two sub-tasks,
i.e., root-relative mesh recovery and root recovery. First, joint landmarks and
silhouette are extracted from a single input image to provide 2D cues for the
3D tasks. In the root-relative mesh recovery task, we exploit semantic
relations among joints to generate a 3D mesh from the extracted 2D cues. Such
generated 3D mesh coordinates are expressed relative to a root position, i.e.,
wrist of the hand. In the root recovery task, the root position is registered
to the camera space by aligning the generated 3D mesh back to 2D cues, thereby
completing cameraspace 3D mesh recovery. Our pipeline is novel in that (1) it
explicitly makes use of known semantic relations among joints and (2) it
exploits 1D projections of the silhouette and mesh to achieve robust

interstellar molecular clouds in observations by the Herschel satellite. These
filaments, especially massive filaments, often extend in a direction
perpendicular to the interstellar magnetic field. Furthermore, the filaments
sometimes have an apparently negative temperature gradient, that is, their
temperature decreases towards the center. In this paper, we study the
magnetohydrostatic equilibrium state of negative-indexed polytropic gas with
the magnetic field running perpendicular to the axis of the filament. The model
is controlled by four parameters: center-to-surface density ratio
($\rho_c/\rho_s$), plasma $\beta$ of the surrounding gas, radius of the parent
cloud $R'_0$ normalized by the scale height, and the polytropic index $N$. The
steepness of the temperature gradient is represented by $N$. We found that the
envelope of the column density profile becomes shallow when the temperature
gradient is large. This reconciles the inconsistency between the observed
profiles and those expected from the isothermal models. We compared the maximum
line-mass (mass per unit length), above which there is no equilibrium, with
that of the isothermal non-magnetized filament. We obtained an empirical
formula to express the maximum line-mass of a magnetized polytropic filament as
$\lambda_{max}\simeq\left[{\left(\lambda_{0,max}(N)/M_\odot{\rm

$\lambda_{0,max}(N)$ represents the maximum line-mass of the non-magnetized
filament and $\Phi_{cl}$ indicates one-half of the magnetic flux threading the
filament per unit length. Although the negative-indexed polytrope makes the
maximum line-mass decrease compared with that of the isothermal model, a
magnetic field threading the filament increases the line-mass.

First, a new DNA architecture is proposed to fit JPEG-based images and improve

the newly arrived dynamic obstacles may invalidate some of the available paths
at any arbitrary point in time. We present DT*, an SMT-based receding horizon
planning strategy that solves an optimization problem repetitively based on the
current status of the workspace to lead the robot to follow the best available
path in the current situation. We implement our algorithm using the Z3 SMT

a lack of effective distortion quantification for a variety of point cloud

quantification method is used to predict human subjective scores and optimize
the selection of human perception tasks parameters, such as compression and
enhancement. For sparse point clouds, a distortion quantification methods is
work as a loss function to guide the training of deep neural networks for
unsupervised learning tasks (e.g., point cloud reconstruction, completion and
upsampling). Therefore, an effective distortion quantification should be
differentiable, distortion discriminable and have a low computational
complexity. However, current distortion quantification cannot satisfy all three
conditions. To fill this gap, we propose a new point cloud feature description
method, the point potential energy (PPE), inspired by the classical physics. We
regard the point clouds are systems that have potential energy and the
distortion can change the total potential energy. By evaluating at various
neighborhood sizes, the proposed MPED achieves global-local tradeoffs,
capturing distortion in a multiscale fashion. We further theoretically show
that classical Chamfer distance is a special case of our MPED. Extensive

robust against a moderate fraction of Byzantine nodes, namely arbitrary and

statistics, the median-of-means (MOM) has been a popular approach to hedge
against Byzantine failures due to its ease of implementation and computational
efficiency. However, the MOM estimator has the shortcoming in terms of
statistical efficiency. The first main contribution of the paper is to propose
a variance reduced median-of-means (VRMOM) estimator, which improves the
statistical efficiency over the vanilla MOM estimator and is computationally as
efficient as the MOM. Based on the proposed VRMOM estimator, we develop a
general distributed inference algorithm that is robust against Byzantine
failures. Theoretically, our distributed algorithm achieves a fast convergence
rate with only a constant number of rounds of communications. We also provide
the asymptotic normality result for the purpose of statistical inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first normality result in the setting of
Byzantine-robust distributed learning. The simulation results are also
presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

temporally distant frames, we perform the two processes of alignment and fusion
in multiple stages. Specifically, at each stage, we perform the denoising

process in multiple stages, we can effectively utilize the information of
neighboring frames without directly aligning the temporally distant frames. We
train our multi-stage system using an adversarial loss with a conditional

mask to prevent introducing high-frequency artifacts in smooth regions. We show
that our system is able to produce temporally coherent videos with realistic

population of merging massive black hole (MBH) binaries, an important source of
gravitational waves. We use a semi-analytical model to describe the orbital
evolution of unequal mass MBH pairs under the influence of stellar and gaseous
dynamical friction in post-merger galaxies. We quantify how the detectability
of approximately 40,000 kpc-scale dAGNs depends on the structure of their host
galaxies and the orbital properties of the MBH pair. Our models indicate that
kpc-scale dAGNs are most likely to be detected in gas-rich post-merger galaxies
with smaller stellar bulges and relatively massive, rapidly rotating gas disks.
The detectability is also increased in systems with MBHs of comparable masses
following low eccentricity prograde orbits. In contrast, dAGNs with retrograde,
low eccentricity orbits are some of the least detectable systems among our
models. The dAGNs in models in which the accreting MBHs are allowed to exhibit
radiative feedback are characterized by a significantly lower overall
detectability. The suppression in detectability is most pronounced in gas-rich
merger remnant galaxies, where radiation feedback is more likely to arise. If
so, then large, relatively gas poor galaxies may be the best candidates for
detecting dAGNs.

they can be externally manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is
installed offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project. Transactions sent not only to

used in the low-energy domain: PENELOPE-2018, EGSnrc, and MCNP. Mass
energy-absorption coefficients for water, air, graphite, and their respective
ratios; absorbed dose; and photon-fluence spectra are considered. Benchmark
simulations using similar cross-sections have been performed. The differences
observed between these quantities when different cross-sections are considered
are taken to be a good estimator for the corresponding Type B uncertainties. A
conservative Type B uncertainty for the absorbed dose (k=2) of 1.2%-1.7% (<50
keV), 0.6%-1.2% (50-100 keV), and 0.3% (100-200 keV) is estimated. The
photon-fluence spectrum does not present clinically relevant differences that
merit considering additional Type B uncertainties except for energies below 25
keV, where a Type B uncertainty of 0.5% is obtained. Below 30 keV, mass
energy-absorption coefficients show Type B uncertainties (k=2) of about 1.5%
(water and air), and 2% (graphite), reaching values about 1% (40-50 keV) and
0.5% (50-75 keV). Type B uncertainties for the water-to-graphite ratios are
observed for energies below 30 keV, about 0.7% (k=2). In contrast with the
intermediate (about 500 keV) or high (about 1 MeV) energy domains, Type B
uncertainties due to the different cross-sections implementation cannot be
considered subdominant with respect to Type A uncertainties or even to other
sources of Type B uncertainties. Therefore, the values reported here should be
accommodated within the uncertainty budget in low-energy photon dosimetry
studies.

robust multivariate generalized t-distribution to model such direct effects in
a probabilistic model framework which can also incorporate the LD structure
explicitly. The generalized t-distribution can be represented as a Gaussian
scaled mixture so that our model parameters can be estimated by the EM-type
algorithms. We compute the standard errors by calibrating the evidence lower
bound using the likelihood ratio test. Through extensive simulation studies, we
show that our RBMR has robust performance compared to other competing methods.
We also apply our RBMR method to two benchmark data sets and find that RBMR has
smaller bias and standard errors. Using our proposed RBMR method, we find that
coronary artery disease is associated with increased risk of critically ill
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We also develop a user-friendly R package

compression. Generally, deep image compression is based on an autoencoder
framework, which transforms the original image to latents at the encoder and
recovers the reconstructed image from the quantized latents at the decoder. The
transform is usually combined with an entropy model, which estimates the
probability distribution of the quantized latents for arithmetic coding.
Currently, joint autoregressive and hierarchical prior entropy models are
widely adopted to capture both the global contexts from the hyper latents and
the local contexts from the quantized latent elements. For the local contexts,
the widely adopted 2D mask convolution can only capture the spatial context.
However, we observe that there are strong correlations between different
channels in the latents. To utilize the cross channel correlations, we propose
to divide the latents into several groups according to channel index and code
the groups one by one, where previously coded groups are utilized to provide
cross channel context for the current group. The proposed cross channel context
model is combined with the joint autoregressive and hierarchical prior entropy
model. Experimental results show that, using PSNR as the distortion metric, the

not make full use of valuable prior knowledge lying in the data, e.g.,
structurally correlated nodes tend to have the same class. In this paper, we
propose a framework based on knowledge distillation to address the above
issues. Our framework extracts the knowledge of an arbitrary learned GNN model
(teacher model), and injects it into a well-designed student model. The student
model is built with two simple prediction mechanisms, i.e., label propagation
and feature transformation, which naturally preserves structure-based and
feature-based prior knowledge, respectively. In specific, we design the student
model as a trainable combination of parameterized label propagation and feature
transformation modules. As a result, the learned student can benefit from both
prior knowledge and the knowledge in GNN teachers for more effective
predictions. Moreover, the learned student model has a more interpretable
prediction process than GNNs. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark
datasets and employ seven GNN models including GCN, GAT, APPNP, SAGE, SGC,
GCNII and GLP as the teacher models. Experimental results show that the learned
student model can consistently outperform its corresponding teacher model by

that transfer learning techniques are highly efficient on end-to-end
architectures for adult-to-child adaptation with a small amount of child speech
data. Through transfer learning, a Transformer model complemented with a
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) objective function, reaches a phone
error rate of 28.1%, outperforming a state-of-the-art DNN-HMM model by 6.6%
relative, as well as other end-to-end architectures by more than 8.5% relative.
An analysis of the models' performance on two specific reading tasks (isolated
words and sentences) is provided, showing the influence of the utterance length
on attention-based and CTC-based models. The Transformer+CTC model displays an
ability to better detect reading mistakes made by children, that can be
attributed to the CTC objective function effectively constraining the attention
mechanisms to be monotonic.

and precision and recall measurement were used as the performance measurement
or evaluation technique. Apache Solr was also used as an environmental
programming language to achieve the evaluation goal. Afaan Oromo text retrieval
is evaluated using 158 documents and 13 arbitrarily selected queries that can
determine the effectiveness of retrieval using the precision-recall. The
average result obtained by our evaluation before the addition of synonymy was
72.91% precision and 86.8% recall respectively. After the addition of synonymy,
the value was changed to 71.39% average precision and 90.5% average recall. The
F-measure for the evaluation before synonymy addition was 79.25% and after
addition changed to 79.82%. The addition of synonymy improves the system

of parallelization, usually relying on uniform Cartesian meshes with a strong
bond between spatial and temporal discretization. This fact complicates the
crucial issue of reducing the computational cost and the memory impact by
automatically coarsening the grid where a fine mesh is unnecessary, still
ensuring the overall quality of the numerical solution through error control.
This work provides a possible answer to this interesting question, by
connecting, for the first time, the field of lattice-Boltzmann Methods (LBM) to
the adaptive multiresolution (MR) approach based on wavelets. To this end, we
employ a MR multi-scale transform to adapt the mesh as the solution evolves in
time according to its local regularity. The collision phase is not affected due
to its inherent local nature and because we do not modify the speed of the
sound, contrarily to most of the LBM/Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategies
proposed in the literature, thus preserving the original structure of any LBM
scheme. Besides, an original use of the MR allows the scheme to resolve the
proper physics by efficiently controlling the accuracy of the transport phase.
We carefully test our method to conclude on its adaptability to a wide family
of existing lattice Boltzmann schemes, treating both hyperbolic and parabolic
systems of equations, thus being less problem-dependent than the AMR
approaches, which have a hard time guaranteeing an effective control on the
error. The ability of the method to yield a very efficient compression rate and
thus a computational cost reduction for solutions involving localized
structures with loss of regularity is also shown, while guaranteeing a precise
control on the approximation error introduced by the spatial adaptation of the
grid. The numerical strategy is implemented on a specific open-source platform
called SAMURAI with a dedicated data-structure relying on set algebra.

latency, it has been successfully applied in many applications of mobile

model can match different quantization bit-precisions according to the
sensitivity of different layers to achieve great performance. However, it is a
difficult problem to quickly determine the quantization bit-precision of each
layer in deep neural networks according to some constraints (e.g., hardware
resources, energy consumption, model size and computation latency). To address
this issue, we propose a novel sequential single path search (SSPS) method for
mixed-precision quantization,in which the given constraints are introduced into
its loss function to guide searching process. A single path search cell is used
to combine a fully differentiable supernet, which can be optimized by
gradient-based algorithms. Moreover, we sequentially determine the candidate
precisions according to the selection certainties to exponentially reduce the

effectiveness of channel attention (e.g., the Squeeze-and-Excitation attention)
for lifting model performance, but they generally neglect the positional
information, which is important for generating spatially selective attention
maps. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism for mobile networks
by embedding positional information into channel attention, which we call
""coordinate attention"". Unlike channel attention that transforms a feature
tensor to a single feature vector via 2D global pooling, the coordinate
attention factorizes channel attention into two 1D feature encoding processes
that aggregate features along the two spatial directions, respectively. In this
way, long-range dependencies can be captured along one spatial direction and
meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved along the other
spatial direction. The resulting feature maps are then encoded separately into
a pair of direction-aware and position-sensitive attention maps that can be
complementarily applied to the input feature map to augment the representations
of the objects of interest. Our coordinate attention is simple and can be
flexibly plugged into classic mobile networks, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNeXt,
and EfficientNet with nearly no computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our coordinate attention is not only beneficial to ImageNet
classification but more interestingly, behaves better in down-stream tasks,
such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Code is available at

to construct a barrier Lyapunov function. This auxiliary performance signal is
reset at each switching instant, which prevents the transgression of the
barriers caused by the jumps of the error metric at switching instants. The
dwell time constraints are derived based on the parameters of the user-defined

the Lyapunov function is non-increasing even at the switching instants and thus
does not impose extra dwell time constraints. Furthermore, we propose the

machine learning, especially for medical image segmentation tasks, since it
alleviates the heavy burden of collecting abundant densely annotated data for

challenging regions (e.g. small branches or blurred edges) during training. We
believe that these unlabeled regions may contain more crucial information to
minimize the uncertainty prediction for the model and should be emphasized in
the training process. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Mutual
Consistency Network (MC-Net) for semi-supervised left atrium segmentation from
3D MR images. Particularly, our MC-Net consists of one encoder and two slightly
different decoders, and the prediction discrepancies of two decoders are
transformed as an unsupervised loss by our designed cycled pseudo label scheme
to encourage mutual consistency. Such mutual consistency encourages the two
decoders to have consistent and low-entropy predictions and enables the model
to gradually capture generalized features from these unlabeled challenging
regions. We evaluate our MC-Net on the public Left Atrium (LA) database and it
obtains impressive performance gains by exploiting the unlabeled data
effectively. Our MC-Net outperforms six recent semi-supervised methods for left

correlation of the ellipticities with the number of members of the sample
clusters. A significant negative correlation between the overall ellipticities
and masses is also detected for the sample clusters with log(age/year) $\geq$
8, suggesting that the overall shapes of the clusters are possibly influenced
by the number of members and masses, in addition to the external forces and the
surrounding environment. For most young sample clusters, the radial
stratification degree of the short axis direction is greater than that of the
long, implying that the radial stratification degree in the two directions
within the young sample cluster may be unevenly affected by an internal
evolutionary process. Older sample clusters exhibit lower stratification in the
tangential direction, which possibly means those clusters may continue to
survive for a long time at a low level of stratification. Our analysis shows
that the overall shape of the sample clusters may be more susceptible to the
influence of Galactic tides toward the Galactic center than the shear forces
embedded in Galactic differential rotation. By analyzing the distribution of

have on a machine learning model. To use differential privacy in machine
learning, data scientists must choose privacy parameters $(\epsilon,\delta)$.
Choosing meaningful privacy parameters is key, since models trained with weak
privacy parameters might result in excessive privacy leakage, while strong
privacy parameters might overly degrade model utility. However, privacy
parameter values are difficult to choose for two main reasons. First, the
theoretical upper bound on privacy loss $(\epsilon,\delta)$ might be loose,
depending on the chosen sensitivity and data distribution of practical
datasets. Second, legal requirements and societal norms for anonymization often
refer to individual identifiability, to which $(\epsilon,\delta)$ are only
indirectly related.
  We transform $(\epsilon,\delta)$ to a bound on the Bayesian posterior belief
of the adversary assumed by differential privacy concerning the presence of any
record in the training dataset. The bound holds for multidimensional queries
under composition, and we show that it can be tight in practice. Furthermore,
we derive an identifiability bound, which relates the adversary assumed in
differential privacy to previous work on membership inference adversaries. We
formulate an implementation of this differential privacy adversary that allows
data scientists to audit model training and compute empirical identifiability
scores and empirical $(\epsilon,\delta)$.

Given two sequences $X$, $Y$ and a constrained sequence $P$, a sequence $Z$ is
a constrained longest common subsequence for $X$ and $Y$ with respect to $P$ if
$Z$ is the longest subsequence of $X$ and $Y$ such that $P$ is a subsequence of

biological cells via phase separation. They play a role in many cellular
processes, but it is unclear how cells control them. Cellular regulation often
relies on post-translational modifications of proteins. For biomolecular
condensates, such chemical modifications could alter the molecular interaction
of key condensate components. We here test this idea using a theoretical model
based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In particular, we describe the
chemical reactions using transition-state theory, which accounts for the
non-ideality of phase separation. We identify that fast control, like in cell
signaling, is only possible when external energy input drives the reaction out
of equilibrium. If this reaction differs inside and outside the droplet, it is
even possible to control droplet sizes. Such an imbalance in the reaction could
be created by enzymes localizing to the droplet. Since this situation is
typical inside cells, we speculate that our proposed mechanism is used to
stabilize multiple droplets with independently controlled size and count. Our
model provides a novel and thermodynamically consistent framework for
describing droplets subject to non-equilibrium chemical reactions.

the search on a few long-lived ones. It also suggests to abandon any

from one specie to another. Moreover, UCXBs are important gravitational wave
(GW) sources and can be detected by future space-borne GW observatories.
However, the formation and evolutionary link between these three different
populations of neutron star (NS) binaries are not fully understood. In
particular, a peculiar fine-tuning problem has previously been demonstrated for
the formation of these systems. In this investigation, we test a newly
suggested magnetic braking prescription and model the formation and evolution
of LMXBs. We compute a grid of binary evolution models and present the initial
parameter space of the progenitor binaries which successfully evolve all the
way to produce UCXBs. We find that the initial orbital period range of LMXBs,
which evolve into detached NS+ELM~He~WD binaries and later UCXBs, becomes
significantly wider compared to evolution with a standard magnetic braking
prescription, and thus helps to relieve the fine-tuning problem. However, we
also find that formation of wide-orbit BMSPs is prohibited for strong versions
of this new magnetic braking prescription, which therefore calls for a revision
of the prescription. Finally, we present examples of the properties of UCXBs as

$\mathcal{G}$ asks whether one can find a subset $S$ of vertices of the input

a graph in $\mathcal{G}$. We investigate the complexity of the problem when
$\mathcal{G}$ is $H$-free for $H$ being a complete graph, a star, a path, or a
cycle. We obtain the following results:
  - When $H$ is a $K_t$ (a complete graph on $t$ vertices) for any fixed $t\geq
1$, the problem is solvable in polynomial-time. This applies even when
$\mathcal{G}$ is a subclass of $K_t$-free graphs recognizable in
polynomial-time, for example, the class of $(t-2)$-degenerate graphs.
  - When $H$ is a $K_{1,t}$ (a star graph on $t+1$ vertices), we obtain that
the problem is NP-complete for every $t\geq 5$. This, along with known results,
leaves only two unresolved cases - $K_{1,3}$ and $K_{1,4}$.
  - When $H$ is a $P_t$ (a path on $t$ vertices), we obtain that the problem is
NP-complete for every $t\geq 7$, leaving behind only two unresolved cases -
$P_5$ and $P_6$.
  - When $H$ is a $C_t$ (a cycle on $t$ vertices), we obtain that the problem
is NP-complete for every $t\geq 8$, leaving behind four unresolved cases -
$C_4, C_5, C_6,$ and $C_7$.
  Further, we prove that these hard problems do not admit subexponential-time
algorithms (algorithms running in time $2^{o(|V(G)|)}$), assuming the
Exponential Time Hypothesis. A simple complementation argument implies that
results for $\mathcal{G}$ are applicable for $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$, thereby
obtaining similar results for $H$ being the complement of a complete graph, a

  Multimedia Tools and Applications 2021",,,"cs.HC cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In the last years, scientific and industrial research has experienced a
growing interest in acquiring large annotated data sets to train artificial
intelligence algorithms for tackling problems in different domains. In this
context, we have observed that even the market for football data has
substantially grown. The analysis of football matches relies on the annotation
of both individual players' and team actions, as well as the athletic
performance of players. Consequently, annotating football events at a
fine-grained level is a very expensive and error-prone task. Most existing
semi-automatic tools for football match annotation rely on cameras and computer
vision. However, those tools fall short in capturing team dynamics, and in
extracting data of players who are not visible in the camera frame. To address
these issues, in this manuscript we present FootApp, an AI-based system for
football match annotation. First, our system relies on an advanced and mixed
user interface that exploits both vocal and touch interaction. Second, the
motor performance of players is captured and processed by applying machine
learning algorithms to data collected from inertial sensors worn by players.
Artificial intelligence techniques are then used to check the consistency of
generated labels, including those regarding the physical activity of players,
to automatically recognize annotation errors. Notably, we implemented a full
prototype of the proposed system, performing experiments to show its
effectiveness in a real-world adoption scenario.

appear naturally, e.g., by minimizing Ginzburg-Landau energy, or use as an
input user-defined singularity pattern, possibly with high valence
singularities that do not appear naturally in cross-field computations. The
first contribution of the paper is the development of a formulation that allows
computing a cross-field from a given set of singularities through the
resolution of two linear PDEs. A specific mesh refinement is applied at the
vicinity of singularities to accommodate the large gradients of cross
directions that appear in the vicinity of singularities of high valence. The
second contribution of the paper is a correction scheme that repairs limit
cycles and/or non-quadrilateral patches. Finally, a high quality
block-structured quad mesh is generated from the quad layout and per-partition
parameterization.

the IGM towards individual galaxies and then divide them in two sub-samples

create average spectra of combined VUDS and VANDELS data for each set of

the variance of the IGM transmission that can be seen directly from high

shock (IS) model can reproduce the fast-rise and slow-decay features of the
pulses in the GRB light curve. The time- and energy-dependent polarization can
deliver important physical information on the emission region and can be used
to test models. Polarization predictions for the GRB prompt phase with the
magnetized IS model should be investigated carefully. The magnetic field of the
magnetized IS model is very likely to be mixed and decays with radius. The
synchrotron emission in the presence of such a decaying magnetic field can
recover the Band-like spectrum of the GRB prompt phase. We investigate the
dependence of the polarization of GRB prompt emission on both time and energy
in the framework of the magnetized IS model. Due to the large range of
parameters, it is hard to distinguish the magnetized IS model and the
magnetic-reconnection model through polarization degree (PD) curves. The
energy-dependent PD could increase toward the high-energy band for the
magnetized IS model, while it decreases to zero above the megaelectronvolt band
for the dissipative photosphere model. Therefore, we conclude that the energy
dependence of PD can be used to distinguish these two models for the GRB prompt
emission. Finally, we find that, independent of the observational energy band,
the profiles of the $\xi_B-PD$ curve for the time-integrated and time-resolved
PDs are very similar, where $\xi_B$ is the magnetic field strength ratio of the
ordered component to the random component.

environments like HII regions needs to be well understood. In this study, we
present magnetic field properties towards the S235 complex using near-infrared
(NIR) $H$-band polarimetric observations, obtained with the Mimir and POLICAN
instruments. We selected 375 background stars in the field through combination
of Gaia distances and extinctions from NIR colors. The plane-of-sky (POS)
magnetic field orientations inferred from starlight polarization angles reveal
a curved morphology tracing the spherical shell of the HII region. The
large-scale magnetic field traced by Planck is parallel to the Galactic plane.
We identified 11 dense clumps using $1.1\,\mathrm{mm}$ dust emission, with
masses between $33-525\,\rm M_\odot$. The clump averaged POS magnetic field
strengths were estimated to be between $36-121\,\mathrm{\mu G}$, with a mean of
${\sim}65\,\mathrm{\mu G}$. The mass-to-flux ratios for the clumps are found to
be sub-critical with turbulent Alfv\'{e}n Mach numbers less than 1, indicating
a strongly magnetized region. The clumps show scaling of magnetic field
strength vs density with a power-law index of $0.52\pm0.07$, similar to
ambipolar diffusion models. Our results indicate the S235 complex is a region
where stellar feedback triggers new stars and the magnetic fields regulate the
rate of new star formation.

acquired through prior experience. To mimic this capability, hierarchical
models combining primitive policies learned from prior tasks have been
proposed. However, these methods fall short comparing to the human's range of
transferability. We propose a method, which leverages the hierarchical
structure to train the combination function and adapt the set of diverse
primitive polices alternatively, to efficiently produce a range of complex
behaviors on challenging new tasks. We also design two regularization terms to
improve the diversity and utilization rate of the primitives in the
pre-training phase. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other recent
policy transfer methods by combining and adapting these reusable primitives in
tasks with continuous action space. The experiment results further show that
our approach provides a broader transferring range. The ablation study also
shows the regularization terms are critical for long range policy transfer.
Finally, we show that our method consistently outperforms other methods when

another option for model serving. Our goal in this paper is to examine the
viability of serverless as a mainstream model serving platform. To this end, we
first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance and cost of
serverless against other model serving systems on Amazon Web Service and Google
Cloud Platform. We find that serverless outperforms many cloud-based
alternatives. Further, there are settings under which it even achieves better
performance than GPU-based systems. Next, we present the design space of
serverless model serving, which comprises multiple dimensions, including cloud

dimension, we analyze the impact of different choices and provide suggestions

discuss challenges and opportunities in building a more practical serverless

ensemble classifier based on probabilistic Support Vector Machine (SVM) in
order to identify pneumonia patterns while providing information about the
reliability of the classification. Specifically, each CCT scan is divided into
cubic patches and features contained in each one of them are extracted by
applying kernel PCA. The use of base classifiers within an ensemble allows our
system to identify the pneumonia patterns regardless of their size or location.
Decisions of each individual patch are then combined into a global one
according to the reliability of each individual classification: the lower the
uncertainty, the higher the contribution. Performance is evaluated in a real
scenario, yielding an accuracy of 97.86%. The large performance obtained and
the simplicity of the system (use of deep learning in CCT images would result
in a huge computational cost) evidence the applicability of our proposal in a

the quasi-static Rayleigh fading Broadcast Channel, for which we first show
that the effective coded caching gain of the XOR-based standard coded-caching
scheme completely vanishes in the low-SNR regime. Then, we reveal that this
collapse is not intrinsic to coded caching. We do so by presenting a novel
scheme that can fully recover the coded caching gains by capitalizing on one
aspect that has to date remained unexploited: the shared side information
brought about by the effectively unavoidable file-size constraint. As a
consequence, the worst-user effect is dramatically ameliorated, as it is
substituted by a much more subtle worst-group-of-users effect, where the
suggested grouping is fixed, and it is decided before the channel or the
demands are known. In some cases, the theoretical gains are completely
recovered, and this is done without any user selection technique. We analyze

Precisely, we provide a spectral characterisation of $k$-WL

dependence for multivariate random variables. According to Sklar's theorem
(Sklar, 1959), any d-dimensional absolutely continuous density can be uniquely
represented as the product of the marginal distributions and a copula function
which captures the dependence structure among the vector components. In real
data applications, the interest of the analyses often lies on specific
functionals of the dependence, which quantify aspects of it in a few numerical
values. A broad literature exists on such functionals, however extensions to
include covariates are still limited. This is mainly due to the lack of
unbiased estimators of the copula function, especially when one does not have
enough information to select the copula model. Recent advances in computational
methodologies and algorithms have allowed inference in the presence of
complicated likelihood functions, especially in the Bayesian approach, whose
methods, despite being computationally intensive, allow us to better evaluate
the uncertainty of the estimates. In this work, we present several Bayesian
methods to approximate the posterior distribution of functionals of the
dependence, using nonparametric models which avoid the selection of the copula

resulting in more than ten times enhancement of sensitivity in absorption
spectroscopy. We demonstrate highly sensitive spectral measurements of low

effects using type-and-effect systems. In this paper, we propose to view an
algebraic effect theory of a computation as a variable context; consequently,
we propose to track algebraic effects of a computation with \emph{contextual
modal types}. We develop ECMTT, a novel calculus which tracks algebraic effects
by a contextualized variant of the modal $\Box$ (necessity) operator, that it
inherits from Contextual Modal Type Theory (CMTT).
  Whereas type-and-effect systems add effect annotations on top of a prior
programming language, the effect annotations in ECMTT are inherent to the
language, as they are managed by programming constructs corresponding to the
logical introduction and elimination forms for the $\Box$ modality. Thus, the
type-and-effect system of ECMTT is actually just a type system.
  Our design obtains the properties of local soundness and completeness, and
determines the operational semantics solely by $\beta$-reduction, as customary
in other logic-based calculi. In this view, effect handlers arise naturally as
a witness that one context (i.e., algebraic theory) can be reached from
another, generalizing explicit substitutions from CMTT.
  To the best of our knowledge, ECMTT is the first system to relate algebraic
effects to modal types. We also see it as a step towards providing a
correspondence in the style of Curry and Howard that may transfer a number of
results from the fields of modal logic and modal type theory to that of
algebraic effects.

upper semi-continuous decomposition yields a homeomorphic decomposition space
if the decomposition is shrinkable (i.e. there exist self-homeomorphisms of the

4-dimensional results: in the disk embedding theorem and in the proof of the
4-dimensional topological Poincare conjecture. It is extensively applied in
constructing approximations of manifold embeddings in dimension at least 5, see

for isogeometric analysis over two-patch domains. One key element of
isogeometric analysis is that it allows high order smoothness within one patch.
However, for representing complex geometries, a multi-patch construction is
needed. In this case, a $C^0$-smooth basis is easy to obtain, whereas
$C^1$-smooth isogeometric functions require a special construction. Such spaces
are of interest when solving numerically fourth-order PDE problems, such as the
biharmonic equation and the Kirchhoff-Love plate or shell formulation, using an
isogeometric Galerkin method.
  With the construction of so-called analysis-suitable $G^1$ (in short,
AS-$G^1$) parametrizations, as introduced in (Collin, Sangalli, Takacs; CAGD,
2016), it is possible to construct $C^1$ isogeometric spaces which possess
optimal approximation properties. These geometries need to satisfy certain
constraints along the interfaces and additionally require that the regularity
$r$ and degree $p$ of the underlying spline space satisfy $1 \leq r \leq p-2$.
The problem is that most complex geometries are not AS-$G^1$ geometries.
Therefore, we define basis functions for isogeometric spaces by enforcing
approximate $C^1$ conditions following the basis construction from (Kapl,
Sangalli, Takacs; CAGD, 2017). For this reason, the defined function spaces are
not exactly $C^1$ but only approximately.
  We study the convergence behavior and define function spaces that converge
optimally under $h$-refinement, by locally introducing functions of higher
polynomial degree and lower regularity. The convergence rate is optimal in
several numerical tests performed on domains with non-trivial interfaces. While
an extension to more general multi-patch domains is possible, we restrict
ourselves to the two-patch case and focus on the construction over a single
interface.

autocorrelation robust (HAR) inference when the data may not satisfy
second-order stationarity. Nonstationarity is a common feature of economic time
series which may arise either from parameter variation or model
misspecification. In such a context, the theories that support HAR inference
are either not applicable or do not provide accurate approximations. HAR tests
standardized by existing long-run variance estimators then may display size
distortions and little or no power. This issue can be more severe for methods
that use long bandwidths (i.e., fixed-b HAR tests). We introduce a class of
nonstationary processes that have a time-varying spectral representation which
evolves continuously except at a finite number of time points. We present an
extension of the classical heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent
(HAC) estimators that applies two smoothing procedures. One is over the lagged
autocovariances, akin to classical HAC estimators, and the other is over time.
The latter element is important to flexibly account for nonstationarity. We
name them double kernel HAC (DK-HAC) estimators. We show the consistency of the
estimators and obtain an optimal DK-HAC estimator under the mean squared error
(MSE) criterion. Overall, HAR tests standardized by the proposed DK-HAC
estimators are competitive with fixed-b HAR tests, when the latter work well,
with regards to size control even when there is strong dependence. Notably, in
those empirically relevant situations in which previous HAR tests are
undersized and have little or no power, the DK-HAC estimator leads to tests
that have good size and power.

data by estimation techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation, Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods, or the non-parametric direct estimation method
introduced by Friedrich et al. The latter has the distinction of being very
effective in the context of large data sets. Due to their $\delta$-correlated
noise, standard Langevin models are limited to Markovian dynamics. A
non-Markovian Langevin model can be formulated by introducing a hidden
component that realizes correlated noise. For the estimation of such a

obtain new strong non-uniqueness results in the even $L^p$-Minkowski problem in
the subcritical range $-n < p < 0$, as well as new rigidity results for the

by users, the generated results are expected to have adequate diversities in
appearance while maintaining correct and reasonable structures in original

Recently proposed generative models complete training based on only one image.
They pay much attention to the monolithic feature of the sample while ignoring
the actual semantic information of different objects inside the sample. As a
result, for ROI-based generation tasks, they may produce inappropriate samples
with excessive randomicity and without maintaining the related objects' correct
structures. To address this issue, this work introduces a
MOrphologic-structure-aware Generative Adversarial Network named MOGAN that
produces random samples with diverse appearances and reliable structures based
on only one image. For training for ROI, we propose to utilize the data coming
from the original image being augmented and bring in a novel module to
transform such augmented data into knowledge containing both structures and
appearances, thus enhancing the model's comprehension of the sample. To learn
the rest areas other than ROI, we employ binary masks to ensure the generation
isolated from ROI. Finally, we set parallel and hierarchical branches of the
mentioned learning process. Compared with other single image GAN schemes, our
approach focuses on internal features including the maintenance of rational
structures and variation on appearance. Experiments confirm a better capacity
of our model on ROI-based image generation tasks than its competitive peers.

costs of modern, potentially overparameterized, networks. Starting from a
pre-trained network, the process is as follows: remove redundant parameters,
retrain, and repeat while maintaining the same test accuracy. The result is a
model that is a fraction of the size of the original with comparable predictive
performance (test accuracy). Here, we reassess and evaluate whether the use of
test accuracy alone in the terminating condition is sufficient to ensure that
the resulting model performs well across a wide spectrum of ""harder"" metrics
such as generalization to out-of-distribution data and resilience to noise.
Across evaluations on varying architectures and data sets, we find that pruned
networks effectively approximate the unpruned model, however, the prune ratio
at which pruned networks achieve commensurate performance varies significantly
across tasks. These results call into question the extent of \emph{genuine}
overparameterization in deep learning and raise concerns about the
practicability of deploying pruned networks, specifically in the context of
safety-critical systems, unless they are widely evaluated beyond test accuracy
to reliably predict their performance. Our code is available at

presented. We show how the origin of spatially localized excitations, as
defined by dynamical facilitation (DF) theory, can be understood from a
structure-based framework. This framework is constructed by associating
excitation events in DF theory to hopping events between energy minima in the
potential energy landscape (PEL). By reducing the PEL to an equal energy well
picture and applying a harmonic approximation, we develop a field theory to
describe elastic fluctuations about inherent states, which are energy
minimizing configurations of the PEL. We model an excitation as a shear
transformation zone (STZ) inducing a localized pure shear deformation onto an
inherent state. We connect STZs to T1 transition events that break the elastic
bonds holding the local structure of an inherent state. A formula for the
excitation energy barrier, denoted as $J_\sigma$, is obtained as a function of
inherent-state elastic moduli and radial distribution function. The energy
barrier from the current theory is compared to one predicted by the DF theory
where good agreement is found in various two-dimensional continuous
poly-disperse atomistic models of glass formers. These results strengthen the
role of structure and elasticity in driving glassy dynamics through the
creation and relaxation of localized excitations.

training (CAPT) systems. However, MDD often suffers from the data-sparsity
problem due to that collecting non-native data and the associated annotations
is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we explore a
fully end-to-end (E2E) neural model for MDD, which processes learners' speech
directly based on raw waveforms. Compared to conventional hand-crafted acoustic
features, raw waveforms retain more acoustic phenomena and potentially can help
neural networks discover better and more customized representations. To this
end, our MDD model adopts a co-called SincNet module to take input a raw
waveform and covert it to a suitable vector representation sequence. SincNet
employs the cardinal sine (sinc) function to implement learnable bandpass
filters, drawing inspiration from the convolutional neural network (CNN). By
comparison to CNN, SincNet has fewer parameters and is more amenable to human
interpretation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the L2-ARCTIC dataset,
which is a publicly-available non-native English speech corpus compiled for
research on CAPT. We find that the sinc filters of SincNet can be adapted
quickly for non-native language learners of different nationalities.
Furthermore, our model can achieve comparable mispronunciation detection
performance in relation to state-of-the-art E2E MDD models that take input the
standard handcrafted acoustic features. Besides that, our model also provides
considerable improvements on phone error rate (PER) and diagnosis accuracy.

nowadays 3D medical image segmentation. The convolutional operations used in
these networks, however, inevitably have limitations in modeling the long-range
dependency due to their inductive bias of locality and weight sharing. Although
Transformer was born to address this issue, it suffers from extreme

maps. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that efficiently bridges a
{\bf Co}nvolutional neural network and a {\bf Tr}ansformer {\bf (CoTr)} for
accurate 3D medical image segmentation. Under this framework, the CNN is
constructed to extract feature representations and an efficient deformable
Transformer (DeTrans) is built to model the long-range dependency on the
extracted feature maps. Different from the vanilla Transformer which treats all
image positions equally, our DeTrans pays attention only to a small set of key
positions by introducing the deformable self-attention mechanism. Thus, the
computational and spatial complexities of DeTrans have been greatly reduced,
making it possible to process the multi-scale and high-resolution feature maps,
which are usually of paramount importance for image segmentation. We conduct an
extensive evaluation on the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault (BCV)

leads to a substantial performance improvement over other CNN-based,
transformer-based, and hybrid methods on the 3D multi-organ segmentation task.

design, referred to as regularized complementary antenna switching (RCAS), to
swiftly adapt both array configuration and excitation weights in accordance to
the dynamic environment for enhancing interference suppression. In order to
achieve an implementable design of array reconfiguration, the RCAS is conducted
in the framework of regularized antenna switching, whereby the full array
aperture is collectively divided into separate groups and only one antenna in
each group is switched on to connect with the processing channel. A set of
deterministic complementary sparse arrays with good quiescent beampatterns is
first designed by RCAS and full array data is collected by switching among them
while maintaining resilient interference suppression. Subsequently, adaptive
sparse array tailored for the specific environment is calculated and
reconfigured based on the information extracted from the full array data. The
RCAS is devised as an exclusive cardinality-constrained optimization, which is
reformulated by introducing an auxiliary variable combined with a piece-wise
linear function to approximate the $l_0$-norm function. A regularization
formulation is proposed to solve the problem iteratively and eliminate the
requirement of feasible initial search point. A rigorous theoretical analysis
is conducted, which proves that the proposed algorithm is essentially an
equivalent transformation of the original cardinality-constrained optimization.
Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed RCAS strategy.

26 arcsec for eight fundamental stars, compared to 49 arcsec of the

and angles between stars to celestial position is very accurate, with errors
negligible with respect to the measurement errors. Due to an offset in the
position of the vernal equinox the positional error of the catalogue is
slightly worse than that of Brahe's catalogue, but when correction is made for
the offset -- which was known to 17th century astronomers -- the catalogue is

chordal graphs is the \textsc{Subset Feedback Vertex Set} (SFVS) problem: given
a vertex-weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $S\subseteq V$, the \textsc{Subset
Feedback Vertex Set} (SFVS) problem asks for a vertex set of minimum weight
that intersects all cycles containing a vertex of $S$. SFVS is known to be
polynomial-time solvable on interval graphs, whereas SFVS remains \NP-complete
on split graphs and, consequently, on chordal graphs. Towards a better
understanding of the complexity of SFVS on subclasses of chordal graphs, we
exploit structural properties of a tree model in order to cope with the
hardness of SFVS. Here we consider variants of the \emph{leafage} that measures
the minimum number of leaves in a tree model. We show that SFVS can be solved
in polynomial time for every chordal graph with bounded leafage. In particular,
given a chordal graph on $n$ vertices with leafage $\ell$, we provide an
algorithm for SFVS with running time $n^{O(\ell)}$. We complement our result by
showing that SFVS is \W[1]-hard parameterized by $\ell$. Pushing further our
positive result, it is natural to consider a slight generalization of leafage,
the \emph{vertex leafage}, which measures the smallest number among the maximum
number of leaves of all subtrees in a tree model. However, we show that it is
unlikely to obtain a similar result, as we prove that SFVS remains \NP-complete
on undirected path graphs, i.e., graphs having vertex leafage at most two.
Moreover, we strengthen previously-known polynomial-time algorithm for SFVS on
rooted path graphs that form a proper subclass of undirected path graphs and
graphs of mim-width one.

the circumstellar disks of young stellar objects, especially for disk
photoevaporation. A signature of this process may be seen in the so far
tentatively observed dependence of stellar accretion rates on X-ray
luminosities. According to models of X-ray driven photoevaporation, stars with
higher X-ray luminosities should show lower accretion rates, on average, in a
sample with similar masses and ages. To this aim, we have analyzed X-ray
properties of young stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster determined with Chandra
during the COUP observation as well as accretion data obtained from the
photometric catalog of the HST Treasury Program. With these data, we have
performed a statistical analysis of the relation between X-ray activity and
accretion rates using partial linear regression analysis. The initial
anticorrelation found with a sample of 332 young stars is considerably weaker
compared to previous studies. However, excluding flaring activity or limiting
the X-ray luminosity to the soft band (0.5 - 2.0 keV) leads to a stronger
anticorrelation, which is statistically more significant. Furthermore, we have
found a weak positive correlation between the higher component of the plasma
temperature gained in the X-ray spectral fitting and the accretion rates,
indicating that the hardness of the X-ray spectra may influence the accretion
process. There is evidence for a weak anticorrelation, as predicted by
theoretical models, suggesting that X-ray photoevaporation modulates the
accretion rate through the inner disk at late stages of disk evolution, leading
to a phase of photoevaporation-starved accretion.

analysed TESS observations of AQ Men, which provide the best light curve of
this object thus far. We show that the depths of the eclipses are changing with
the orientation of the accretion disc, which means that they can serve as a
direct test of the tilted accretion disc models. The precession period of the
accretion disc is increasing during the TESS observations. However, it is still
shorter than the period determined in the previous studies. The amplitude of
the variability related to the precession of the accretion disc varies, and so
does the shape of this variability. Moreover, we have detected a positive
superhump that was previously unseen in AQ Men. Interestingly, the positive
superhump has a strongly non-sinusoidal shape, which is not expected for a

autonomous driving and robotic grasping. However, several studies showed that
it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, an attacker can make a
classifier predict an incorrect label for a 3D point cloud via carefully
modifying, adding, and/or deleting a small number of its points. Randomized
smoothing is state-of-the-art technique to build certifiably robust 2D image
classifiers. However, when applied to 3D point cloud classification, randomized
smoothing can only certify robustness against adversarially modified points.
  In this work, we propose PointGuard, the first defense that has provable
robustness guarantees against adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted
points. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and an arbitrary point cloud
classifier, our PointGuard first creates multiple subsampled point clouds, each
of which contains a random subset of the points in the original point cloud;
then our PointGuard predicts the label of the original point cloud as the
majority vote among the labels of the subsampled point clouds predicted by the
point cloud classifier. Our first major theoretical contribution is that we
show PointGuard provably predicts the same label for a 3D point cloud when the
number of adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points is bounded. Our
second major theoretical contribution is that we prove the tightness of our
derived bound when no assumptions on the point cloud classifier are made.
Moreover, we design an efficient algorithm to compute our certified robustness
guarantees. We also empirically evaluate PointGuard on ModelNet40 and ScanNet
benchmark datasets.

with an RGB-D camera and a low-end off-the-shelf single board computer. The
overall system includes SLAM, global path planning, ground segmentation, and
motion planning. The proposed ground segmentation approach extracts a
traversability map from raw depth images for the safe driving of low-body
mobile robots. We apply both rule-based and learning-based navigation policies
using the traversability map. Running sensor data processing and other
autonomous driving components simultaneously, our navigation policies perform
rapidly at a refresh rate of 18 Hz for control command, whereas other systems
have slower refresh rates. Our methods show better performances than current
state-of-the-art navigation approaches within limited computation resources as
shown in 3D simulation tests. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of
our mobile robot system through successful autonomous driving in an indoor

image fusion or pansharpening is proposed. Such image adjustment is needed for
most pansharpening methods using panchromatic band and/or intensity image
(calculated as a weighted sum of multispectral bands) as an input. Due various
reasons, e.g. calibration inaccuracies, usage of different sensors, input
images for pansharpening: low resolution multispectral image or more precisely
the calculated intensity image and high resolution panchromatic image may
differ in values of their physical properties, e.g. radiances or reflectances
depending on the processing level. But the same objects/classes in both images
should exhibit similar values or more generally similar statistics. Similarity
definition will depend on a particular application. For a successful fusion of
data from two sensors the energy balance between radiances/reflectances of both
sensors should hold. A virtual band is introduced to compensate for total
energy disbalance in different sensors. Its estimation consists of several
steps: first, weights for individual spectral bands are estimated in a low
resolution scale, where both multispectral and panchromatic images (low pass
filtered version) are available, then, the estimated virtual band is up-sampled
to a high scale and, finally, high resolution panchromatic band is corrected by
subtracting virtual band. This corrected panchromatic band is used instead of
original panchromatic image in the following pansharpening. It is shown, for
example, that the performance quality of component substitution based methods
can be increased significantly.

differences in ventricular features were assessed between bvFTD, normal
controls and other dementia cohorts. RESULTS: Ventricular antero-posterior
ratio (APR) was the only feature that was significantly different and increased
faster in bvFTD compared to all other cohorts. We achieved a 10-fold

generalize poorly to real-world noisy images. While curating real-world noisy
images and improving ground truth estimation procedures remain key points of
interest, a potential research direction is to explore extensions to the widely
used convolutional neuron model to enable better generalization with fewer data
and lower network complexity, as opposed to simply using deeper Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Operational Neural Networks (ONNs) and their recent
variant, Self-organized ONNs (Self-ONNs), propose to embed enhanced
non-linearity into the neuron model and have been shown to outperform CNNs
across a variety of regression tasks. However, all such comparisons have been
made for compact networks and the efficacy of deploying operational layers as a
drop-in replacement for convolutional layers in contemporary deep architectures

analysis of where on the object's bounding box the user is looking, to 3. use a
simple machine learning classifier to determine whether the overt visual

Our decoding system ultimately determines whether the user wants to drive to

from this motor imagery (akin to neural interfaces) remain decodable. Once a
driving intention and thus also the location is detected our system instructs
our autonomous wheelchair platform, the A.Eye-Drive, to navigate to the desired

purposes, we have realised a cognitive-level human interface, as it requires

demonstrate that the gradient's magnitude correlates with the curvature of the

propose a general acceleration strategy, M+ acceleration, which enables an
automatic and highly effective method of adjusting the training procedure. M+
acceleration is computationally efficient and easy to implement. It is suited
for DEAT and compatible with the majority of existing adversarial training
techniques. Extensive experiments have been done on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet

  We study the sets of Dopplergrams and magnetograms observed with SDO and
Hinode spacecrafts and a MHD simulation. All of the aligned sequences, which
were corrected from the satellite motions and tracked with the differential
rotation, were used to detect the long-lasting downflows in the quiet-Sun at
the disc centre. To learn about the structure of the flows below the solar
surface, the time-distance local helioseismology was used.
  The inspection of the 3D data cube (x, y, t) of the 24-hour Doppler sequence
allowed us to detect 13 persistent downflows. Their lifetimes lie in the range
between 3.5 and 20 hours with sizes between 2"" and 3"" and speeds between -0.25
and -0.72 km/s. These persistent downflows are always filled with the magnetic
field with an amplitude of up to 600 G. The helioseismic inversion allows us to
describe the persistent downflows and compare them to the other
(non-persistent) downflows in the field of view. The persistent downflows seem
to penetrate much deeper and, in the case of a well-formed vortex, the
vorticity keeps its integrity to the depth of about 5 Mm. In the MHD
simulation, only sub-arcsecond downflows are detected with no evidence of a
vortex comparable in size to observations at the surface of the Sun.
  The long temporal sequences from the space-borne allow us to show the
existence of long-persistent downflows together with the magnetic field. They
penetrate inside the Sun but are also connected with the anchoring of coronal
loops in the photosphere, indicating a link between downflows and the coronal
activity. A link suggests that EUV cyclones over the quiet Sun could be an
effective way to heat the corona.

elements (e.g., carbon), it is not a major constituent of dust grains in
diffuse interstellar clouds. Here, we determine the gas-phase carbon-to-sulfur
abundance ratio, [C]/[S], and the sulfur abundance [S] in a dense star-forming
cloud from new radio recombination lines (RRLs) detected with the Yebes 40m
telescope - at relatively high frequencies (~40 GHz ~7 mm) and angular
resolutions (down to 36'') - in the Orion Bar, a rim of the Orion Molecular
Cloud (OMC). We detect nine Cn\alpha RRLs (with n=51 to 59) as well as nine
narrow line features separated from the Cn\alpha lines by delta v=-8.4+/-0.3 km
s^-1. Based on this velocity separation, we assign these features to sulfur
RRLs, with little contribution of RRLs from the more condensable elements Mg,
Si, or Fe. Sulfur RRLs lines trace the photodissociation region (PDR) of the
OMC. In these predominantly neutral gas layers, up to A_V~4, the ions C+ and S+
lock in most of the C and S gas-phase reservoir. We determine a relative
abundance of [C]_Ori/[S]_Ori=10.4+/-0.6 and, adopting the same [C]_Ori measured
in the translucent gas toward star theta^1 Ori B, an absolute abundance of
[S]_Ori=(1.4+/-0.4)x10^-5. This value is consistent with emission models of the
observed sulfur RRLs if N(S+)~7x10^17 cm^-2 (beam-averaged). The [S]_Ori is the
''initial'' sulfur abundance in the OMC, before an undetermined fraction of the
[S]_Ori goes into molecules and ice mantles in the cloud interior. The inferred
abundance [S]_Ori matches the solar abundance, thus implying that there is
little depletion of sulfur onto rocky dust grains, with D(S)=0.0+/-0.2 dex.

spin states remain unaffected by the quantisation of the background in which
the quantum matter propagates. Here, we explore a new model of nonlocal
geometry in which the Planck-scale smearing of classical points generates GURs
for angular momentum. These, in turn, imply an analogous generalisation of the
spin uncertainty relations. The new relations correspond to a novel
representation of {\rm SU(2)} that acts nontrivially on both subspaces of the
composite state describing matter-geometry interactions. For single particles
each spin matrix has four independent eigenvectors, corresponding to two
$2$-fold degenerate eigenvalues $\pm (\hbar + \beta)/2$, where $\beta$ is a
small correction to the effective Planck's constant. These represent the spin
states of a quantum particle immersed in a quantum background geometry and the
correction by $\beta$ emerges as a direct result of the interaction terms. In
addition to the canonical qubits states, $\ket{0} = \ket{\uparrow}$ and
$\ket{1} = \ket{\downarrow}$, there exist two new eigenstates in which the spin
of the particle becomes entangled with the spin sector of the fluctuating
spacetime. We explore ways to empirically distinguish the resulting `geometric'
qubits, $\ket{0'}$ and $\ket{1'}$, from their canonical counterparts.

be due to differences in line positions and strengths, as well as the
incompleteness of the line-lists. Nonetheless, this marginal detection is
consistent with the prediction that H$_{2}$O is mostly thermally dissociated in
the upper atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiters. Therefore, along with CO, OH is
expected to be one of the most abundant O-bearing molecules in the day-side
atmosphere of ultra-hot Jupiters and should be considered when studying their
atmosphere.

  https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51388868/Thesis.pdf",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Two popular types of machine translation (MT) are phrase-based and neural
machine translation systems. Both of these types of systems are composed of
multiple complex models or layers. Each of these models and layers learns
different linguistic aspects of the source language. However, for some of these
models and layers, it is not clear which linguistic phenomena are learned or
how this information is learned. For phrase-based MT systems, it is often clear
what information is learned by each model, and the question is rather how this
information is learned, especially for its phrase reordering model. For neural
machine translation systems, the situation is even more complex, since for many
cases it is not exactly clear what information is learned and how it is
learned.
  To shed light on what linguistic phenomena are captured by MT systems, we
analyze the behavior of important models in both phrase-based and neural MT
systems. We consider phrase reordering models from phrase-based MT systems to
investigate which words from inside of a phrase have the biggest impact on
defining the phrase reordering behavior. Additionally, to contribute to the
interpretability of neural MT systems we study the behavior of the attention
model, which is a key component in neural MT systems and the closest model in
functionality to phrase reordering models in phrase-based systems. The
attention model together with the encoder hidden state representations form the
main components to encode source side linguistic information in neural MT. To
this end, we also analyze the information captured in the encoder hidden state
representations of a neural MT system. We investigate the extent to which
syntactic and lexical-semantic information from the source side is captured by
hidden state representations of different neural MT architectures.

framework to learn a feature descriptor for correspondence matching without any

as an optimization problem that jointly optimizes the feature descriptor and
the geometric models given a large corpus of visual measurements (e.g., images,
point clouds). Under this optimization formulation, we show that two important
streams of research in vision, namely robust model fitting and deep feature
learning, correspond to optimizing one block of the unknown variables while
fixing the other block. This analysis naturally leads to our second
contribution -- the SGP algorithm that performs alternating minimization to
solve the joint optimization. SGP iteratively executes two meta-algorithms: a
teacher that performs robust model fitting given learned features to generate
geometric pseudo-labels, and a student that performs deep feature learning
under noisy supervision of the pseudo-labels. As a third contribution, we apply
SGP to two perception problems on large-scale real datasets, namely relative
camera pose estimation on MegaDepth and point cloud registration on 3DMatch. We
demonstrate that SGP achieves state-of-the-art performance that is on-par or

simulations including road vehicle aerodynamics. Numerical diffusion occurs
when local flow direction is not aligned with the mesh lines and when there is
a non-zero gradient of the dependent variable in the direction normal to the
streamline direction. It has been observed that typical numerical
discretization schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations such as first order
upwinding produce very accurate solutions without numerical diffusion when the
mesh is aligned with the streamline directions. On the other hand, numerical
diffusion is maximized when the streamline direction is at an angle of 45{\deg}
relative to the mesh line. The amount of numerical diffusion can be reduced by
mesh refinements such as aligning mesh lines along the local flow direction or
by introducing higher order numerical schemes which may introduce potential
numerical instability or additional computational cost. Couple test cases of a
simple steady-state incompressible and inviscid air flow convection problem
were used to investigate whether numerical diffusion occurs when using Physics
Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that rely on automatic differentiation as
opposed to numerical techniques used in traditional Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) solvers. Numerical diffusion was not observed when PINNs were
used to solve the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for the simple convection
problem irrespective of flow angle. The PINN correctly simulated the streamwise
upwinding, which has great potential to improve the accuracy of Navier-Stokes

gap opening at the Fermi level and an additional breaking of the six-fold
rotation symmetry, which persists through the superconducting transition. This
rotation symmetry breaking is observed as the emergence of an additional 4a0
unidirectional charge order and strongly anisotropic scattering in differential
conductance maps. The latter can be directly attributed to the
orbital-selective renormalization of the V kagome bands. Our experiments reveal
a complex landscape of electronic states that can co-exist on a kagome lattice,

iron meteorites and are considered to have formed early in the terrestrial
planet region before migrating to the main asteroid belt. Surface temperatures
and mutual collision velocities differ between the terrestrial planet region
and the main asteroid belt. To investigate the dependence of crater shape on
temperature, velocity and impactor density, we conducted impact experiments on
room- and low-temperature iron meteorite and iron alloy targets (carbon steel
SS400 and iron-nickel alloy) with velocities of 0.8-7 km/s. The projectiles
were rock cylinders and metal spheres and cylinders. Oblique impact experiments
were also conducted using stainless steel projectiles and SS400 steel targets
which produced more prominent radial patterns downrange at room temperature
than at low temperature. Crater diameters and depths were measured and compiled
using non-dimensional parameter sets based on the $\pi$-group crater scaling
relations. Two-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted using iSALE-2D
code with the Johnson-Cook strength model. Both experimental and numerical
results showed that the crater depth and diameter decreased with decreasing
temperature, which strengthened the target, and with decreasing impact
velocity. The decreasing tendency was more prominent for depth than for
diameter, i.e., the depth/diameter ratio was smaller for the low temperature
and low velocity conditions. The depth/diameter ratios of craters formed by
rock projectiles were shallower than those of craters formed by metallic
projectiles. Our results imply that the frequency distribution of the
depth/diameter ratio for craters on the surface of metallic bodies may be used
as a probe of the past impact environment of metallic bodies.

business and infrastructure system networks allowing for integration of several
models into one simulation. However, the integration is frequently challenging
as each system is designed individually with different characteristics, such as
time granularity. Understanding the impact of time granularity on propagation
of disruptions between businesses and infrastructure systems and finding the
appropriate granularity for the SoS simulation remain as major challenges. To
tackle these, we explore how time granularity, recovery time, and disruption
size affect the propagation of disruptions between constituent systems of an
SoS simulation. To address this issue, we developed a High Level Architecture
(HLA) simulation of 3 networks and performed a series of simulation
experiments. Our results revealed that time granularity and especially recovery
time have huge impact on propagation of disruptions. Consequently, we developed
a model for selecting an appropriate time granularity for an SoS simulation
based on expected recovery time. Our simulation experiments show that time
granularity should be less than 1.13 of expected recovery time. We identified
some areas for future research centered around extending the experimental
factors space.

observed line ratios in the SNR spectrum can be understood if the local
interstellar medium is ionized by 2dFS 3831 and/or OB stars around the SNR. We
propose that MCSNR J0127-7332 is the result of supernova explosion within a
bubble produced by the stellar wind of the supernova progenitor and that the
bubble was surrounded by a massive shell at the moment of supernova explosion.
We estimated the age of MCSNR J0127-7332 to be \la 10 000 yr. We found that the
spectrum of 2dFS 3831 changes with orbital phase. Namely, the equivalent width
of the Halpha emission line decreased by \approx 40 per cent in \approx 130 d
after periastron passage of the neutron star and then almost returned to its
original value in the next \approx 100 d. Also, the spectrum of 2dFS 3831
obtained closest to the periastron epoch (about three weeks after the

renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in deep learning
(DL). The success of DL largely lies on data representation because different
representations can indicate to a degree the different explanatory factors of
variation behind the data. In the last few year, the most successful story in
DL is supervised learning. However, to apply supervised learning, one challenge
is that data labels are expensive to get, noisy, or only partially available.
With consideration that we human beings learn in an unsupervised way;
self-supervised learning methods have garnered a lot of attention recently. A
dominant force in self-supervised learning is the autoencoder, which has
multiple uses (e.g., data representation, anomaly detection, denoise). This
research explored the application of an autoencoder to learn effective data
representation of helicopter flight track data, and then to support helicopter
track identification. Our testing results are promising. For example, at
Phoenix Deer Valley (DVT) airport, where 70% of recorded flight tracks have
missing aircraft types, the autoencoder can help to identify twenty-two times
more helicopters than otherwise detectable using rule-based methods; for Grand
Canyon West Airport (1G4) airport, the autoencoder can identify thirteen times
more helicopters than a current rule-based approach. Our approach can also
identify mislabeled aircraft types in the flight track data and find true types
for records with pseudo aircraft type labels such as HELO. With improved
labelling, studies using these data sets can produce more reliable results.

  Multi-Access Communication System",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A Chaotic Pseudo Orthogonal Carriers Multi-Access (CPOCMA) communication
based on Chaotic Pseudo Orthogonal Shape-forming Filter (CPOSF) bank, Chaotic
Pseudo Orthogonal Matched Filter (CPOMF) bank and Chaotic Pseudo Orthogonal
Correlation Filter (CPOCF) bank is proposed in this work. At the transmitter,
the multiple CPOSFs are used to generate pseudo orthogonal signals. It provides
a good trade-off between spectrum efficiency and high bit transmission rate. At
the receiver, the CPOMF bank and CPOCF bank are used to maximize the
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and extract the received information from each
sub-channel, respectively. The received signal is demodulated by averaging the
sampled sequence from the matched filter bank output and sorting the sampling
sequence from the CPOCF bank output to recover the transmitted information
bits. The proposed CPOCMA communication system not only offers multiuser access
with high reliability and high data transmission rate, but also achieves higher
spectrum efficiency. Analytical Bit Error Rate (BER) expression is derived. The
proposed communication system performance has been evaluated in Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel and wireless channel by both numerical
simulations and experiments based on a Wireless open-Access Research Platform
(WARP), the results show the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed
method.

  Speech Affect Recognition Classification Accuracy",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Speech Affect Recognition is a problem of extracting emotional affects from
audio data. Low resource languages corpora are rear and affect recognition is a
difficult task in cross-corpus settings. We present an approach in which the
model is trained on high resource language and fine-tune to recognize affects
in low resource language. We train the model in same corpus setting on SAVEE,
EMOVO, Urdu, and IEMOCAP by achieving baseline accuracy of 60.45, 68.05, 80.34,
and 56.58 percent respectively. For capturing the diversity of affects in
languages cross-corpus evaluations are discussed in detail. We find that
accuracy improves by adding the domain target data into the training data.
Finally, we show that performance is improved for low resource language speech
affect recognition by achieving the UAR OF 69.32 and 68.2 for Urdu and Italian
speech affects.

radiators in free space is presented. With the proposed definition of reactive
energies and radiative energies, power balance at arbitrarily chosen
observation surfaces are established, which intuitively shows that the Poynting
vector contains not only the power flux density associated with the radiative
energies, but also the influence of the fluctuation of the reactive energies
dragging by the sources. A new vector is defined for the radiative power flux
density. The radiative energies passing through observation surfaces enclosing
the radiator are accurately calculated. Numerical results verifies that the
proposed radiative flux density is more proper for expressing the radiative
power flux density than the Poynting vector.

applications and it aims to support different traffic categories via various
scheduling mechanisms. Those scheduling mechanisms rely on a precise network
performance measurement to dynamically adjust the scheduling strategies.
Machine Learning (ML) offers an iterative procedure to measure network
performance. Network Calculus (NC) can calculate the bounds for the main
performance indexes such as latencies and throughputs in an RTN for ML. Thus,
the ML and NC integration improve overall calculation efficiency. This paper
will provide a survey for different approaches of Real-Time Network performance

provoked questions about the very nature of reality. We address these questions
by considering the universe, and the multiverse, fundamentally as complex
patterns, or mathematical structures. Basic mathematical structures can be
expressed more simply in terms of emergent parameters. Even simple mathematical
structures can interact within their own structural environment, in a
rudimentary form of self-awareness, which suggests a definition of reality in a
mathematical structure as simply the complete structure. The absolute
randomness of quantum outcomes is most satisfactorily explained by a multiverse
of discrete, parallel universes. Some of these have to be identical to each
other, but that introduces a dilemma, because each mathematical structure must
be unique. The resolution is that the parallel universes must be embedded
within a mathematical structure, the multiverse, which allows universes to be
identical within themselves, but nevertheless distinct, as determined by their
position in the structure. The multiverse needs more emergent parameters than
our universe and so it can be considered to be a superstructure.
Correspondingly, its reality can be called a super-reality. While every
universe in the multiverse is part of the super-reality, the complete
super-reality is forever beyond the horizon of any of its component universes.
