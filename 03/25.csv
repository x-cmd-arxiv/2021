may either contract a disease through sexual contact with an infected nearest
neighbor or use safe sex practices under the influence of neighbors who are
already adopting precautions. We show that both interaction between susceptible
and infected individuals and the imitation of opinions concerning safe sex
practices between individuals in favor of using such practices and those
opposed to them leads to a phase transition. If the parameters of the epidemic
are in the supercritical state, corresponding to an unlimited growth of
infection, the interaction parameter of the sociological debate must also be in
the supercritical state to control the spread of infection, and bring the
system to criticality.
  Adopting a theoretical perspective like that of multilayer complex networks,
we study the case where the epidemic network is under the influence of the
above-mentioned sociological debate. We show that at criticality this debate
generates clusters of individuals in favor of safe sex practices and clusters
of individuals opposing their use. We study the influence of a sociological
debate on whether to use safe sex or not, on the spreading of sexually
transmitted infections. We show that due to this debate in the epidemic network
a pattern mirroring the structures of the sociological network appears.
  Finally, we introduce a feedback of the epidemic network on the sociological
network and prove that due to this feedback the sociological system undergoes a
process of self-organization keeping it at criticality. We hope that these
results have the effect of giving interesting suggestions to behavioral
psychologists and information scientists actively involved in the analysis of
the social debate on the moral issues connected to sexual activities.

image classification on the ILSVRC dataset, and then fine-tune on any target
task. However, previous systematic studies of transfer learning have been
limited and the circumstances in which it is expected to work are not fully

transfer learning across vastly different image domains (consumer photos,
autonomous driving, aerial imagery, underwater, indoor scenes, synthetic,
close-ups) and task types (semantic segmentation, object detection, depth
estimation, keypoint detection). Importantly, these are all complex, structured
output tasks types relevant to modern computer vision applications. In total we
carry out over 2000 transfer learning experiments, including many where the
source and target come from different image domains, task types, or both. We
systematically analyze these experiments to understand the impact of image
domain, task type, and dataset size on transfer learning performance. Our study
leads to several insights and concrete recommendations: (1) for most tasks
there exists a source which significantly outperforms ILSVRC'12 pre-training;
(2) the image domain is the most important factor for achieving positive
transfer; (3) the source dataset should \emph{include} the image domain of the
target dataset to achieve best results; (4) at the same time, we observe only
small negative effects when the image domain of the source task is much broader
than that of the target; (5) transfer across task types can be beneficial, but
its success is heavily dependent on both the source and target task types.

Subjunctive theories put forward modal or subjunctive conditions to rule out

analysis of knowledge as justified true belief. Because of the subjunctive
nature of these conditions the resulting semantics turns out to be
non-monotone, even if it is based on non-classical evaluation schemes such as

long-duration balloon flight of SPIDER, an experiment designed to map the
polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on degree angular scales.
Results from these measurements include maps and angular power spectra from
observations of 4.8% of the sky at 95 and 150 GHz, along with the results of
internal consistency tests on these data. While the polarized CMB anisotropy
from primordial density perturbations is the dominant signal in this region of
sky, Galactic dust emission is also detected with high significance; Galactic
synchrotron emission is found to be negligible in the SPIDER bands. We employ
two independent foreground-removal techniques in order to explore the
sensitivity of the cosmological result to the assumptions made by each. The
primary method uses a dust template derived from Planck data to subtract the
Galactic dust signal. A second approach, employing a joint analysis of SPIDER
and Planck data in the harmonic domain, assumes a modified-blackbody model for
the spectral energy distribution of the dust with no constraint on its spatial
morphology. Using a likelihood that jointly samples the template amplitude and
$r$ parameter space, we derive 95% upper limits on the primordial
tensor-to-scalar ratio from Feldman-Cousins and Bayesian constructions, finding
$r<0.11$ and $r<0.19$, respectively. Roughly half the uncertainty in $r$
derives from noise associated with the template subtraction. New data at 280
GHz from SPIDER's second flight will complement the Planck polarization maps,
providing powerful measurements of the polarized Galactic dust emission.

numerous highly variable young stellar objects (YSOs). We present a study of 61
highly variable VVV YSOs ($\Delta K_s$ = 1-5 mag), combining near infrared
spectra from Magellan and VLT with VVV and NEOWISE light curves to investigate
physical mechanisms behind eruptive events. Most sources are spectroscopically
confirmed as eruptive variables (typically Class I YSOs) but variable
extinction is also seen. Among them, magnetically controlled accretion,
identified by H{\sc i} recombination emission (usually accompanied by CO
emission), is observed in 46 YSOs. Boundary layer accretion, associated with FU
Ori-like outbursts identified by CO overtone and H$_2$O absorption, is observed
only in longer duration events ($\ge$5 yr total duration). However, even in
long duration events, the magnetically controlled accretion mode predominates,
with amplitudes similar to the boundary layer mode. Shorter (100-700 days)
eruptive events usually have lower amplitudes and these events are generally
either periodic accretors or multiple timescale events, wherein large
photometric changes occur on timescales of weeks and years. We find that the
ratio of amplitudes in $K_s$ and $W2$ can distinguish between variable
accretion and variable extinction. Several YSOs are periodic or quasi-periodic
variables. We identify examples of periodic accretors and extinction-driven
periodicity among them (with periods up to 5 yr) though more data are needed to
classify some cases. The data suggest that dynamic interactions with a
companion may control the accretion rate in a substantial proportion of
eruptive systems, although star-disc interactions should also be considered.

from the evolutionary histories of other genes. For example, some individual
genes or operons can be affected by specific horizontal gene transfer and
recombination events. Thus, the evolutionary history of each gene should be
represented by its own phylogenetic tree which may display different
evolutionary patterns from the species tree that accounts for the main patterns
of vertical descent. The output of traditional consensus tree or supertree
inference methods is a unique consensus tree or supertree. We describe a new
efficient method for inferring multiple alternative consensus trees and
supertrees to best represent the most important evolutionary patterns of a
given set of gene phylogenies. We show how an adapted version of the popular
k-means clustering algorithm, based on some interesting properties of the
Robinson and Foulds distance, can be used to partition a given set of trees
into one (for homogeneous data) or multiple (for heterogeneous data) cluster(s)
of trees. Moreover, we adapt the popular Cali\'nski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Ball

special attention is given to the relevant but very challenging problem of
inferring alternative supertrees. The use of the Euclidean property of the
objective function of the method makes it faster than the existing tree
clustering techniques, and thus perfectly suitable for analyzing large
evolutionary datasets. We apply the new method to discover alternative

both components of the interaction implemented in the Idaho-Salamanca potential
make the contact terms to be present at large distances while the local
regularization of the pion exchanges in the Bochum potential restricts the
contact interactions to small distances. Also, the value of the cutoff affects
the strength of the potential but the interplay between pion exchanges and

propagation-based methods have made significant progress in addressing node
classification tasks on graphs. However, in addition to their reliance on
elaborate architectures and algorithms, there are several key technical details
that are frequently overlooked, and yet nonetheless can play a vital role in
achieving satisfactory performance. In this paper, we first summarize a series
of existing tricks-of-the-trade, and then propose several new ones related to
label usage, loss function formulation, and model design that can significantly
improve various GNN architectures. We empirically evaluate their impact on
final node classification accuracy by conducting ablation studies and
demonstrate consistently-improved performance, often to an extent that
outweighs the gains from more dramatic changes in the underlying GNN
architecture. Notably, many of the top-ranked models on the Open Graph

correlated with each other, and functioning together. Many group variable
selection methods are developed to select the groups of predictors that are
closely related to the continuous or categorical response. These existing
methods usually assume the group structures are well known. For example,
variables with similar practical meaning, or dummy variables created by
categorical data. However, in practice, it is impractical to know the exact
group structure, especially when the variable dimensional is large. As a
result, the group variable selection results may be selected. To solve the
challenge, we propose a two-stage approach that combines a variable clustering
stage and a group variable stage for the group variable selection problem. The
variable clustering stage uses information from the data to find a group
structure, which improves the performance of the existing group variable
selection methods. For ultrahigh dimensional data, where the predictors are
much larger than observations, we incorporated a variable screening method in
the first stage and shows the advantages of such an approach. In this article,
we compared and discussed the performance of four existing group variable
selection methods under different simulation models, with and without the
variable clustering stage. The two-stage method shows a better performance, in
terms of the prediction accuracy, as well as in the accuracy to select active
predictors. An athlete's data is also used to show the advantages of the
proposed method.

characteristic examples of these giant planets. It has been suggested that the
envelope mass loss during giant impacts plays a key role in the formation of
such giant planets. The aim of the present letter is to propose a mechanism
that can explain the origin of such giant planets. We investigate the formation
of giant planets in a rapidly dissipating disk using N-body simulations that
consider pebble accretion. The results show that although the pebble isolation
mass is smaller than the metal mass (> 30 Earth masses) in some giant planets,
the interior metal mass can be increased by giant impacts between planets with
the isolation mass. Regarding the metal fraction, the cores accrete massive
envelopes by runaway gas accretion during the disk-dissipation phase of 1-10
Myr in a disk that evolves without photoevaporation. Although a large fraction
of the envelope can be lost during giant impacts, the planets can reaccrete the
envelope after impacts in a slowly dissipating disk. Here, we demonstrate that,
by photoevaporation in a rapidly dissipating disk, the runaway gas accretion is
quenched in the middle, resulting in the formation of giant planets with large
metal-mass fractions. The origins of HD 149026b and TOI-849b, which are
characterized by their large metal-mass fractions, can be naturally explained
by a model that considers a disk evolving with photoevaporation.

violation of monotonicity lead to a small problem or a big problem? We find a
phase transition for the monotonicity condition. On one of the boundary of the
phase transition, it is easy to learn the sign of LATE and on the other side of
the boundary, it is impossible to learn the sign of LATE. Unfortunately, the
impossible side of the phase transition includes data-generating processes
under which the proportion of defiers tends to zero. This boundary of phase
transition is explicitly characterized in the case of binary outcomes. Outside
a special case, it is impossible to test whether the data-generating process is

observations collected in 2000 and 2014, simultaneously fitting the reflection
grating spectrometer (RGS) and EPIC-pn spectra of each epoch, for the first
time, with the photoionisation model, PION, in SPEX. We find that four PION
components are required to fit the majority of the emission lines in the
spectra of NGC 1068, with $\log \xi=1-4$, $\log N_H>26 m^{-2}$, and
$v_{out}=-100$ to $-600 kms^{-1}$ for both epochs. Comparing the ionisation
state of the components shows almost no difference between the two epochs,
while there is an increase in the total column density. To estimate the
locations of these plasma regions from the central black hole we compare
distance methods, excluding the variability arguments as there is no spectral
change between observations. Although the methods are unable to constrain the
distances, the locations are consistent with the narrow line region, with the
possibility of the higher ionised component being part of the broad line
region, but we cannot conclude this for certain. In addition, we find evidence
for emission from collisionally ionised plasma, while previous analysis had
suggested that collisional plasma emission was unlikely. However, although PION
is unable to account for the FeXVII emission lines at 15 and 17 \AA, we do not
rule out that photoexcitation is a valid processes to produce these lines too.
NGC 1068 has not changed, both in terms of the observed spectra or from our
modelling, within the 14 year time period between observations. This suggests
that the ELRs are fairly static relative to the 14 year time frame between
observations, or there is no dramatic change in the black hole variability.

  Open Source Repositories",,,,,"cs.SE cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The lack of comprehensive sources of accurate vulnerability data represents a
critical obstacle to studying and understanding software vulnerabilities (and
their corrections). In this paper, we present an approach that combines
heuristics stemming from practical experience and machine-learning (ML) -
specifically, natural language processing (NLP) - to address this problem. Our
method consists of three phases. First, an advisory record containing key
information about a vulnerability is extracted from an advisory (expressed in
natural language). Second, using heuristics, a subset of candidate fix commits
is obtained from the source code repository of the affected project by
filtering out commits that are known to be irrelevant for the task at hand.
Finally, for each such candidate commit, our method builds a numerical feature
vector reflecting the characteristics of the commit that are relevant to
predicting its match with the advisory at hand. The feature vectors are then
exploited for building a final ranked list of candidate fixing commits. The
score attributed by the ML model to each feature is kept visible to the users,
allowing them to interpret the predictions.
  We evaluated our approach using a prototype implementation named FixFinder on
a manually curated data set that comprises 2,391 known fix commits
corresponding to 1,248 public vulnerability advisories. When considering the
top-10 commits in the ranked results, our implementation could successfully
identify at least one fix commit for up to 84.03% of the vulnerabilities (with
a fix commit on the first position for 65.06% of the vulnerabilities). In
conclusion, our method reduces considerably the effort needed to search OSS
repositories for the commits that fix known vulnerabilities.

pre-main sequence stars (IMPS; i.e. intermediate-mass T Tauri stars), late-B
and A stars on the zero-age main sequence (AB), and lower-mass T Tauri stars
(TTS). We divide our sources among these three sub-classifications and further
identify disk-bearing young stellar objects versus diskless sources with no
detectable infrared (IR) excess emission using IR (1--8 $\mu$m) spectral energy
distribution modeling. We then perform X-ray spectral fitting to determine the
hydrogen absorbing column density ($N_{\rm H}$), absorption-corrected X-ray
luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and coronal plasma temperature ($kT$) for each
source. We find that the X-ray spectra of both IMPS and TTS are characterized
by similar $kT$ and $N_{\rm H}$, and on average $L_{\rm X}$/$L_{\rm bol}
\sim4\times10^{-4}$. IMPS are systematically more luminous in X-rays (by
$\sim$0.3 dex) than all other sub-classifications, with median $L_{\rm X} =
2.5\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$, while AB stars of similar masses have X-ray
emission consistent with TTS companions. These lines of evidence converge on a
magneto-coronal flaring source for IMPS X-ray emission, a scaled-up version of
the TTS emission mechanism. IMPS therefore provide powerful probes of
isochronal ages for the first $\sim$10 Myr in the evolution of a massive
stellar population, because their intrinsic, coronal X-ray emission decays
rapidly after they commence evolving along radiative tracks. We suggest that
the most luminous (in both X-rays and IR) IMPS could be used to place empirical
constraints on the location of the intermediate-mass stellar birth line.

coefficient yields an estimated von K\'arm\'an constant $k \approx 0.387$,

canonical wall-bounded flows. The same constant also applies to the pipe
centerline velocity, thus providing support for the claim that the asymptotic
state of pipe flow at extreme Reynolds numbers should be plug flow. At the
Reynolds numbers under scrutiny, no evidence for saturation of the logarithmic
growth of the inner peak of the axial velocity variance is found. Although no

heterogeneities of soil or subsurface parameters. To give spatial
approximations of these random fields, they are discretized. Then, different
techniques of geostatistical inversion are used to condition them on
measurement data. Among these techniques, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
techniques stand out, because they yield asymptotically unbiased conditional
realizations. However, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer
the curse of dimensionality when refining the discretization. This means that
their efficiency decreases rapidly with an increasing number of discretization
cells. Several MCMC approaches have been developed such that the MCMC
efficiency does not depend on the discretization of the random field. The
pre-conditioned Crank Nicolson Markov Chain Monte Carlo (pCN-MCMC) and the
sequential Gibbs (or block-Gibbs) sampling are two examples. In this paper, we
will present a combination of the pCN-MCMC and the sequential Gibbs sampling.
Our algorithm, the sequential pCN-MCMC, will depend on two tuning-parameters:
the correlation parameter $\beta$ of the pCN approach and the block size
$\kappa$ of the sequential Gibbs approach. The original pCN-MCMC and the Gibbs
sampling algorithm are special cases of our method. We present an algorithm
that automatically finds the best tuning-parameter combination ($\kappa$ and
$\beta$) during the burn-in-phase of the algorithm, thus choosing the best
possible hybrid between the two methods. In our test cases, we achieve a
speedup factors of $1-5.5$ over pCN and of $1-6.5$ over Gibbs. Furthermore, we

overshooting parameter for a sample of 37 $\gamma$ Doradus stars. Here, our
goal is to perform the parameter estimation from modelling of individual
periods measured for dipole modes with consecutive radial order. We have
trained neural networks to predict theoretical pulsation periods of high-order
gravity modes as well as the luminosity, effective temperature, and surface
gravity for a given mass, age, overshooting parameter, diffusive envelope
mixing, metallicity, and near-core rotation frequency. We have applied our
neural networks for Computing Pulsation Periods and Photospheric Observables,
C-3PO, to our sample and compute grids of stellar pulsation models for the
estimated parameters. We present the near-core rotation rates (from literature)
as a function of the inferred stellar age and critical rotation rate. We assess
the rotation rates of the sample near the start of the main sequence assuming
rigid rotation. Furthermore, we measure the extent of the core overshoot region
and find no correlation with mass, age, or rotation. The neural network
approach developed in this study allows for the derivation of stellar
properties dominant for stellar evolution -- such as mass, age, and extent of
core-boundary mixing. It also opens a path for future estimation of mixing
profiles throughout the radiative envelope, with the aim to infer those
profiles for large samples of $\gamma$ Doradus stars.

local baryon number must be broken below the multi-TeV scale to satisfy the

lepton asymmetry generated via leptogenesis can be converted in two different
ways: a) in the theory predicting Majorana dark matter the lepton asymmetry is
converted into a baryon asymmetry, and b) in the theory with Dirac dark matter
the decays of right-handed neutrinos can generate lepton and dark matter
asymmetries that are then partially converted into a baryon asymmetry.
Consequently, we show how to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the dark
matter relic density and neutrino masses in theories for local baryon and

Existing numerical works suggest that the spin-orbital $SU(4)$ symmetric
Kugel-Khomskii model of Mott insulators on the honeycomb lattice realizes a
Dirac spin-orbital liquid, described at low energy by $(2+1)d$ quantum
electrodynamics (QED$_3$) with $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions. We generalize methods
previously developed for $SU(2)$ spin systems to analyze the symmetry
properties and stability of the Dirac spin-orbital liquid. We conclude that the
standard Dirac state in the $SU(4)$ honeycomb system, based on a simple parton
mean-field ansatz, is intrinsically unstable at low energy due to the existence
of a monopole perturbation that is allowed by physical symmetries and relevant
under renormalization group flow. We propose two plausible alternative
scenarios compatible with existing numerics. In the first scenario, we propose
an alternative $U(1)$ Dirac spin-orbital liquid, which is similar to the
standard one except for its monopole symmetry quantum numbers. This alternative
$U(1)$ state represents a stable gapless phase. In the second scenario, we
start from the standard $U(1)$ Dirac liquid and Higgs the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry
down to $\mathbb{Z}_4$. The resulting $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Dirac spin-orbital liquid
is stable. We also discuss the continuous quantum phase transitions from the

play a significant role on $\gtrsim 100$ pc scales. The correlation is also
sensitive to the choice of the local star formation efficiency per freefall

constraining REMs, gyrochronology, and understanding of stellar physics. Our
resulting REMs, which implement the best-possible fitting form of a broken
power-law torque, are statistically improved on previous REMs using similar
formulations, but still do not simultaneously describe the observed rotation
distributions of the lowest masses, which have both slow and fast rotators by
the Praesepe age, and the shape of the converged sequence for higher masses.
Further complexity in the REMs is thus required to accurately describe the
data.

diagnose chaotic {\it vs} integrable dynamics in many-body quantum systems.
Here, we analyze operator spreading in generic 1D many-body quantum systems
using a combination of matrix product operator (MPO) and analytical techniques,
focusing on the operator {\em right-weight}. First, we show that while small
bond dimension MPOs allow one to capture the exponentially-decaying tail of the
operator front, in agreement with earlier results, they lead to significant
quantitative and qualitative errors for the actual front -- defined by the
maximum of the right-weight. We find that while the operator front broadens
diffusively in both integrable and chaotic interacting spin chains, the precise
shape and scaling of the height of the front in integrable systems is anomalous
for all accessible times. We interpret these results using a quasiparticle
picture. This provides a sharp, though rather subtle signature of many-body
quantum chaos in the operator front.

particle packing density, driven by the stochastic nature of the spreading
process, impedes optical interrogation of these layer attributes. Thus, we
present transmission X-ray imaging as a method for directly mapping the
effective depth of powder layers at process-relevant scale and resolution.
Specifically, we study layers of nominal 50-250 micrometer thickness, created
by spreading a selection of commercially obtained Ti-6Al-4V, 316 SS, and
Al-10Si-Mg powders into precision-depth templates. We find that powder layer
packing fraction may be predicted from a combination of the relative thickness
of the layer as compared to mean particle size, and flowability assessed by
macroscale powder angle of repose. Power spectral density analysis is
introduced as a tool for quantification of defect severity as a function of
morphology, and enables separate consideration of layer uniformity and
sparsity. Finally, spreading is studied using multi-layer templates, providing
insight into how particles interact with both previously deposited material and
abrupt changes in boundary condition. Experimental results are additionally
compared to a purpose-built discrete element method (DEM) powder spreading
simulation framework, clarifying the competing role of adhesive and
gravitational forces in layer uniformity and density, as well as particle
motion within the powder bed during spreading.

problems in an autonomous vehicle, while depth estimation as an essential issue
becomes a challenging problem using a monocular camera. Since both camera and
objects are moving, the issue can be formed as a structure from motion (SFM)
problem. In this paper, to elicit features from an image, the YOLOv3 approach
is utilized beside an OpenCV tracker. Subsequently, to obtain the lateral and
longitudinal distances, a nonlinear SFM model is considered alongside a
state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) filter and a newly developed
observation model. Additionally, a switching method in the form of switching
estimation error covariance is proposed to enhance the robust performance of
the SDRE filter. The stability analysis of the presented filter is conducted on
a class of discrete nonlinear systems. Furthermore, the ultimate bound of
estimation error caused by model uncertainties is analytically obtained to
investigate the switching significance. Simulations are reported to validate
the performance of the switched SDRE filter. Finally, real-time experiments are
performed through a multi-thread framework implemented on a Jetson TX2 board,
while radar data is used for the evaluation.

running of $\theta_{23}$. Though all the NSI parameters influence the evolution
of $\theta_{13}$, $\varepsilon_{e\mu}$ and $\varepsilon_{e\tau}$ show a
stronger impact at the energies relevant for DUNE. $\theta_{12}$ quickly
approaches to $\sim$ $90^{\circ}$ with increasing energy in both SI and SI+NSI
cases. The change in $\Delta m^2_{21,m}$ is quite significant as compared to
$\Delta m^2_{31,m}$ both in SI and SI+NSI frameworks. Flipping the signs of the
NSI parameters alters the way in which mass-mixing parameters run with energy.
We demonstrate the utility of our approach in addressing several important
features related to neutrino oscillation such as: a) unraveling interesting
degeneracies between $\theta_{23}$ and NSI parameters, b) estimating the
resonance energy in presence of NSI when $\theta_{13}$ in matter becomes
maximal, c) figuring out the required baselines and energies to have maximal
matter effect in $\nu_{\mu}$ $\rightarrow$ $\nu_{e}$ transition in the presence
of different NSI parameters, and d) studying the impact of NSI parameters

  Physics of the Dark Universe",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider three phantom dark energy models, in the context
of interaction between the dark components namely cold dark matter (CDM) and
dark energy (DE). The first model, known as $w_{\textrm{d}}$CDM can induce a
big rip singularity (BR) while the two remaining induce future abrupt events
known as the Little Rip (LR) and Little Sibling of the Big Rip (LSBR). These
phantom DE models can be distinguished by their equation of state. We invoke a
new phenomenon such as the interaction between CDM and DE given that it could
solve or alleviate some of the problems encountered in standard cosmology. We
aim to find out the effect of such an interaction on the cosmological
parameters of the studied models, as well as, the persistence or the
disappearance of the singularity and the abrupt events induced by the models
under study. We choose an interaction term proportional to DE density, i.e.
$Q=\lambda H \rho_{\textrm{d}}$, since the case where $Q\propto
\rho_{\textrm{m}}$ could lead to a large scale instability at early time. We
also do not claim at all that $Q=\lambda H \rho_{\textrm{d}}$ is the ideal
choice since it suffers from a negative CDM density in the future. By the use
of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, and by assuming a flat FLRW
Universe, we constrain the cosmological parameters of each of the three phantom
DE models studied. Furthermore, by the aid of the corrected Akaike Information
Criterion ($\text{AIC}_{c}$) tool, we compare our phantom DE models. Finally, a
perturbative analysis of phantom DE models under consideration is performed
based on the best fit background parameters.

T$_c = 332$ K, and studied its magnetic properties by vibrating sample
magnetometry (VSM) and broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy.
The experiments were performed with external magnetic fields applied along the
c-axis (H$\parallel$c) and the ab-plane (H$\parallel$ab), with temperatures
ranging from 300 K to 10 K. We have found a sizable Land\'e g-factor difference
between the H$\parallel$c and H$\parallel$ab cases. In both cases, the Land\'e
g-factor values deviated from g = 2. This indicates contribution of orbital
angular momentum to the magnetic moment. The FMR measurements reveal that
Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ has a damping constant comparable to Permalloy. With reducing
temperature, the linewidth was broadened. Together with the VSM data, our
measurements indicate that Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ transitions from ferromagnetic to
ferrimagnetic at lower temperatures. Our experiments highlight key information

location of an XXL cluster (defined within XXL as an extended X-ray source). Of
the unmatched CAMIRA clusters, the majority display low X-ray fluxes consistent
with the lack of an XXL counterpart. However, a significant fraction (64/107)
CAMIRA clusters that display high X-ray fluxes are not asociated with an
extended source in the XXL catalogue. We demonstrate that this disparity arises
from a variety of effects including the morphological criteria employed to

derive kinetic equations for the strong-field regime of quantum electrodynamics

regime is characterized by a large photon field of order $\mathcal{O}(1/e)$,
which is relevant for the description of, e.g., intense laser fields, the
initial stages of off-central heavy ion collisions, and condensed matter
systems with net fermion number. The strong field enters the dynamical
equations via both quantum Vlasov and collision terms, which we derive to order
$\mathcal{O}(e^2)$. The kinetic equations feature generalized scattering
amplitudes that have their own equation of motion in terms of the fermion
spectral function. The description includes single photon emission,
electron-positron pair photoproduction, vacuum (Schwinger) pair production,
their inverse processes, medium effects and contributions from the field, which
are not restricted to the so-called locally-constant crossed field
approximation. This extends known kinetic equations commonly used in
strong-field QED of intense laser fields. In particular, we derive an
expression for the asymptotic fermion pair number that includes leading-order
collisions and remains valid for strongly inhomogeneous fields. For the purpose
of analytically highlighting limiting cases, we also consider plane-wave fields
for which it is shown how to recover Furry-picture scattering amplitudes by
further assuming negligible occupations. Known on-shell descriptions are
recovered in the case of simply peaked ultrarelativistic fermion occupations.
Collisional strong-field equations are necessary to describe the dynamics to
thermal equilibrium starting from strong-field initial conditions.

potential of the base electrode. As typical of bipolar transistors, the
collector current undergoes a tenfold increase for each 60 mV increase of the

evolution of the spin period and pulsed flux is studied with Fermi/GBM during
the outburst and the spin-up rate is found to be varied between
$\simeq(0.8-1.8)\times 10^{-11}$ Hz s$^{-1}$. The pulse profile shows energy
dependence and variability. The pulse profile shows multiple peaks and dips
which evolve with energy. The evolution of the spectral state of this source is
also studied using the hardness intensity diagram (HID). The HID shows a
transition from the horizontal to the diagonal branch, which implies the source
went through a state transition from the subcritical to supercritical accretion
regime. The NICER energy spectrum is well described by a composite model of a
power-law with a higher cut-off energy and blackbody components along with a
photo-electric absorption component. An iron emission line is detected near 6.4
keV in the NICER spectrum with an equivalent width of $\sim$0.05 keV. The
photon index shows an anti-correlation with flux below the critical flux. The
mass accretion rate is estimated to be $\simeq1.3\times10^{17}$ g s$^{-1}$ near
the peak of the outburst. We have found a positive correlation between the
pulse frequency derivatives and luminosity. The Ghosh and Lamb model is applied
to estimate the magnetic field at different spin-up rates, which is compared to
the earlier estimated magnetic field at a relatively high mass accretion rate.

applies a convolution to the communication graph formed by the multi-agent
system. In this paper, we investigate whether the performance and
generalization of GCNs can be improved upon. We introduce ModGNN, a
decentralized framework which serves as a generalization of GCNs, providing
more flexibility. To test our hypothesis, we evaluate an implementation of
ModGNN against several baselines in the multi-agent flocking problem. We
perform an ablation analysis to show that the most important component of our
framework is one that does not exist in a GCN. By varying the number of agents,
we also demonstrate that an application-agnostic implementation of ModGNN
possesses an improved ability to generalize to new environments.

methods that learn associated features sharing a domain, DRANet preserves the
distinctiveness of each domain's characteristics. Our model encodes individual

from both source and target images. Then, it adapts the domain by incorporating
the transferred style factor into the content factor along with learnable
weights specified for each domain. This learning framework allows
bi-/multi-directional domain adaptation with a single encoder-decoder network
and aligns their domain shift. Additionally, we propose a content-adaptive
domain transfer module that helps retain scene structure while transferring
style. Extensive experiments show our model successfully separates
content-style factors and synthesizes visually pleasing domain-transferred

on phenomena such as quantum ergodicity and scarring, relatively little is
known at the rigorous level about the existence of eigenfunctions whose

between certain regimes - for example, at the transition between Anderson
localized and delocalized eigenfunctions, or in systems whose classical
dynamics is intermediate between integrability and chaos - have been
conjectured in the physics literature to have eigenfunctions exhibiting
multifractal, self-similar structure. To-date, no rigorous mathematical results
have been obtained about systems of this kind in the context of quantum chaos.
We give here the first rigorous proof of the existence of multifractal
eigenfunctions for a widely studied class of intermediate quantum systems.
Specifically, we derive an analytical formula for the Renyi entropy associated
with the eigenfunctions of arithmetic Seba billiards, in the semiclassical
limit, as the associated eigenvalues tend to infinity. We also prove
multifractality of the ground state for more general, non-arithmetic billiards
and show that the fractal exponent in this regime satisfies a symmetry
relation, similar to the one predicted in the physics literature, by
establishing a connection with the functional equation for Epstein's zeta

solution for a static, spherically-symmetric system in conformal gravity (CG)
predicts flat rotation curves, such as those observed in galaxies, without the
need for dark matter. This prediction assumes that test particles have fixed
rest mass and follow timelike geodesics in the MK metric in the vacuum region
exterior to a spherically-symmetric representation of the galactic mass
distribution. Such geodesics are not conformally invariant, however, which
leads to an apparent discrepancy with the analogous calculation performed in
the conformally-equivalent Schwarzschild-de-Sitter (SdS) metric, where the
latter does not predict flat rotation curves. This difference arises since the
mass of particles in CG must instead be generated dynamically through
interaction with a scalar field. The energy-momentum of this required scalar
field means that, in a general conformal frame from the equivalence class of CG
solutions outside a static, spherically-symmetric matter distribution, the
spacetime is not given by the MK vacuum solution. A unique frame does exist,
however, for which the metric retains the MK form, since the scalar field
energy-momentum vanishes despite the field being non-zero and radially
dependent. Nonetheless, we show that in both this MK frame and the Einstein
frame, in which the scalar field is constant, massive particles follow timelike
geodesics of the SdS metric, thereby resolving the apparent frame dependence of
physical predictions and unambiguously yielding rotation curves with no flat

selects a subset of images from the full dataset with balanced attribute
distributions across protected attributes. Our matching approach first projects
real images onto a generative adversarial network (GAN)'s latent space in a
manner that preserves semantic attributes. It then finds image matches in this

semantic and perceptual attributes are balanced across the protected attribute.
We validate projection and matching strategies with qualitative, quantitative,

simultaneous chemical enrichment challenges the single-star scenario. Previous
works indeed suggested a stellar merger origin for $\tau$ Sco. However, the
merger scenario also faces similar challenges as our magnetic single-star
models to explain $\tau$ Sco's simultaneous slow rotation and nitrogen excess.
In conclusion, the single-star channel seems less likely and versatile to
explain these discrepancies, while the merger scenario and other potential
binary-evolution channels still require further assessment as to whether they
may self-consistently explain the observables of $\tau$ Sco.

mathematical difficulties caused by random matrices that appear in research
related to deep neural networks (DNNs), such as the dynamical isometry, Fisher
information matrix, and training dynamics. FPT suits these researches because
the DNN's parameter-Jacobian and input-Jacobian are polynomials of layerwise
Jacobians. However, the critical assumption of asymptotic freenss of the
layerwise Jacobian has not been proven completely so far. The asymptotic
freeness assumption plays a fundamental role when propagating spectral
distributions through the layers. Haar distributed orthogonal matrices are
essential for achieving dynamical isometry. In this work, we prove asymptotic
freeness of layerwise Jacobians of multilayer perceptron (MLP) in this case. A
key of the proof is an invariance of the MLP. Considering the orthogonal
matrices that fix the hidden units in each layer, we replace each layer's
parameter matrix with itself multiplied by the orthogonal matrix, and then the
MLP does not change. Furthermore, if the original weights are Haar orthogonal,
the Jacobian is also unchanged by this replacement. Lastly, we can replace each
weight with a Haar orthogonal random matrix independent of the Jacobian of the
activation function using this key fact.

transition lines, we detect kinematic deviations to the Keplerian rotation,
which are consistent with the presence of a large vortex around the dust

Comparisons with a vortex model suggest velocity deviations up to 350 m/s after
deprojection compared to the background Keplerian rotation, as well as an
extension of about 40 au radially on both sides of the vortex and 200 degrees
azimuthally, yielding an azimuthal-to-radial aspect ratio of 5. Another
alternative for explaining the vortex-like signal implies artificial velocity
deviations generated by beam smearing in association with variations of the gas
velocity due to gas pressure gradients at the inner and outer edges of the
circumbinary disk. The two scenarios are currently difficult to differentiate
and, for this purpose, would probably require the use of multiple lines at a
higher spatial resolution. The beam smearing effect, due to the finite spatial
resolution of the observations and gradients in the line emission, should be
common in observations of protoplanetary disks and may lead to
misinterpretations of the gas velocity, in particular around ring-like

this aim, frequent transmissions of lengthy pilot sequences are generally
required, at the cost of substantial overhead. In this work we propose a
DNN-aided symbol detector, Meta-ViterbiNet, that tracks channel variations with
reduced overhead by integrating three complementary techniques: 1) We leverage
domain knowledge to implement a model-based/data-driven equalizer, ViterbiNet,
that operates with a relatively small number of trainable parameters; 2) We
tailor a meta-learning procedure to the symbol detection problem, optimizing
the hyperparameters of the learning algorithm to facilitate rapid online
adaptation; and 3) We adopt a decision-directed approach based on coded
communications to enable online training with short-length pilot blocks.
Numerical results demonstrate that Meta-ViterbiNet operates accurately in
rapidly-varying channels, outperforming the previous best approach, based on
ViterbiNet or conventional recurrent neural networks without meta-learning, by
a margin of up to 0.6dB in bit error rate in various challenging scenarios.

Ahmed body at $Re_H=33,333$ is presented. The study consists of both
wall-resolved (WRLES) and wall-modelled (WMLES) simulations, and investigates
the bimodal switching of the wake between different horizontal positions.
Within a non-dimensional time-window of 1050 convective flow units, both WRLES
and WMLES simulations, for which only the near-wall region of the turbulent
boundary layer is treated in a Reynolds-averaged sense, are able to capture
horizontal (spanwise) shifts in the wake's cross-stream orientation.
Equilibrium wall-models in the form of Spalding's law and the log-law of the
wall are successfully used. Once these wall-models are, however, applied to a
very coarse near-wall WMLES mesh, in which a portion of the turbulent boundary
layer's outer region dynamics is treated in a Reynolds-averaged manner as well,
large-scale horizontal shifts in the wake's orientation are no longer detected.
This suggests larger-scale flow structures found within the turbulent boundary
layer's outer domain are responsible for generating the critical amount of flow
intermittency needed to trigger a bimodal switching event. By looking at mean
flow structures, instantaneous flow features and their associated turbulent

bubbles just aft of the Ahmed body nose generate high levels of TKE through the
shedding of large hairpin vortices. Only in the reference WRLES and
(relatively) fine near-wall mesh WMLES simulations are these features present,

2018 October through 2019 March as well as 10 epochs during the 1991, 1997, and
2008 apparitions. The ensemble photometry reveals a typical composition and a
secular decrease in activity since 1991. Production rates were roughly
symmetric around perihelion for the carbon-bearing species (CN, C$_3$, and
C$_2$), but steeper for OH and NH outbound. Our imaging program emphasized CN,
whose coma morphology and lightcurve yielded rotation periods reported in a
companion paper (Farnham et al., PSJ, 2, 7). Here, we compare the gas and dust
morphology on the 18 nights for which observations of additional species were
obtained. The carbon-bearing species exhibited similar morphology that varied
with rotation. OH and NH had broad, hemispheric brightness enhancements in the
tailward direction that did not change significantly with rotation, which we
attribute to their originating from a substantial icy grain component. We
constructed a Monte Carlo model that replicates the shape, motion, and
brightness distribution of the CN coma throughout the apparition with a single,
self-consistent solution in principal axis rotation. Our model yields a pole
having (R.A., Decl.) = 319$^\circ$, $-$5$^\circ$ (pole obliquity of 70$^\circ$)
and two large sources (radii of 50$^\circ$ and 40$^\circ$) centered at
near-equatorial latitudes and separated in longitude by $\sim$160$^\circ$.

technique, and has yielded impressive results in many real-world tasks.
Generally, existing NMF methods represent each sample with several centroids,
and find the optimal centroids by minimizing the sum of the approximation
errors. However, the outliers deviating from the normal data distribution may
have large residues, and then dominate the objective value seriously. In this
study, an Entropy Minimizing Matrix Factorization framework (EMMF) is developed
to tackle the above problem. Considering that the outliers are usually much
less than the normal samples, a new entropy loss function is established for
matrix factorization, which minimizes the entropy of the residue distribution
and allows a few samples to have large approximation errors. In this way, the
outliers do not affect the approximation of the normal samples. The
multiplicative updating rules for EMMF are also designed, and the convergence
is proved both theoretically and experimentally. In addition, a Graph
regularized version of EMMF (G-EMMF) is also presented to deal with the complex
data structure. Clustering results on various synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the reasonableness of the proposed models, and the effectiveness is
also verified through the comparison with the state-of-the-arts.

that the low-dimensional representations are achieved. However, in real-world

the discriminative features, some methods project the samples into the subspace

learns the weights of features adaptively according to their importances; 2) it

for this thesis is real-time power dispatch of distributed energy resources for

renewable energy penetration. In this application, it is paramount that agent
data be shared as sparsely as possible in the interest of conserving user
privacy, and it is required that algorithms scale gracefully as the network
size increases to the order of thousands or millions of resources and devices.
Distributed algorithms are naturally well-poised to address these challenges,
in contrast to more traditional centralized algorithms which scale poorly and
require global access to information.
  The class of distributed optimization methods explored here can be broadly
described as Newton-like or second-order, implying utilization of
second-derivative information of the cost functions, in contrast to
well-studied gradient-based or first-order methods. We consider three
formulations of separable resource-allocation problems and develop a
Newton-like algorithm for each. The analysis and simulation studies in the
subsequent chapters demonstrate the advantages of our approaches over existing
methods; most commonly, we note that convergence rates are substantially
improved. We supplement our algorithm development for these three problem
formulations with a network design technique, in which we can construct a
maximally-connected network by adding some edges to the underlying
communication graph, and a real demonstration of distributed algorithms on a
large set of heterogeneous devices on the UC San Diego microgrid.

for thermoelectric (TE) device applications due to its high TE figure of merit,
which is mainly contributed by its inherently low lattice thermal conductivity.
This work investigates the effect of the lattice anharmonicity driven by
temperature-dependent phonon dispersions on thermal transport of ZrS2 ML. The
calculations are based on the self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory to calculate
the thermodynamic parameters along with the lattice thermal conductivity. The
higher- order (quartic) force constants were extracted by using an efficient
compressive sensing lattice dynamics technique, which estimates the necessary
data based on the emerging machine learning program as an alternative of
computationally expensive density functional theory calculations. Resolve of
the degeneracy and hardening of the vibrational frequencies of low-energy
optical modes were predicted upon including the quartic anharmonicity. As
compared to the conventional Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) approach, the
lattice thermal conductivity of the optimized ZrS2 ML unit cell within SCP +
BTE approach is found to be significantly enhanced (e.g., by 21% at 300 K).
This enhancement is due to the relatively lower value of phonon linewidth
contributed by the anharmonic frequency renormalization included in the SCP
theory. Mainly, the conventional BTE approach neglects the temperature
dependence of the phonon frequencies due to the consideration of harmonic
lattice dynamics and treats the normal process of three-phonon scattering
incorrectly due to the use of quasi-particle lifetimes. These limitations are
addressed in this work within the SCP + BTE approach, which signifies the
validity and accuracy of this approach.

rotating traversable wormholes by means of the resonance models. We investigate
the linear stability of the circular geodesic orbits in the equatorial plane
for a general class of wormhole geometries deriving analytical expressions for
the epicyclic frequencies. Since wormholes can often mimic black holes in the
astrophysical observations, we analyze the properties of the quasi-circular
oscillatory motion in comparison with the Kerr black hole. We demonstrate that
wormholes possess distinctive features, which can be observationally
significant. It is characteristic for the Kerr black hole that the orbital and
the epicyclic frequencies obey a constant ordering in the whole range of the
spin parameter. In contrast, for wormhole spacetimes we can have various types
of orderings between the frequencies in the different regions of the parametric
space. This enables the excitation of much more diverse types of resonances
including parametric and forced resonances of lower order, which could lead to
stronger observable signals. In addition, for co-rotating orbits the resonances
can be excited in a very close neighbourhood of the wormhole throat for a wide
range of values of the angular momentum, making wormholes a valuable laboratory
for testing strong gravity.

  2021",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed control agents have been advocated as an effective means for
improving the resiliency of our physical infrastructures under unexpected
events. Purely local control has been shown to be insufficient, centralized
optimal resource allocation approaches can be slow. In this context, we put
forth a hybrid low-communication saturation-driven protocol for the
coordination of control agents that are distributed over a physical system and
are allowed to communicate with peers over a ""hotline"" communication network.
According to this protocol, agents act on local readings unless their control
resources have been depleted, in which case they send a beacon for assistance
to peer agents. Our ripple-type scheme triggers communication locally only for
the agents with saturated resources and it is proved to converge. Moreover,
under a monotonicity assumption on the underlying physical law coupling control
outputs to inputs, the devised control is proved to converge to a configuration
satisfying safe operational constraints. The assumption is shown to hold for
voltage control in electric power systems and pressure control in water
distribution networks. Numerical tests corroborate the efficacy of the novel
scheme.

  Recommendation",,"ACM Transactions on Information Systems. 2021",,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we study group recommendation in a particular scenario, namely
Occasional Group Recommendation (OGR). Most existing works have addressed OGR
by aggregating group members' personal preferences to learn the group
representation. However, the representation learning for a group is most
complex beyond the fusion of group member representation, as the personal
preferences and group preferences may be in different spaces. In addition, the
learned user representation is not accurate due to the sparsity of users'
interaction data. Moreover, the group similarity in terms of common group
members has been overlooked, which however has the great potential to improve
the group representation learning. In this work, we focus on addressing the
above challenges in group representation learning task, and devise a
hierarchical hyperedge embedding-based group recommender, namely HyperGroup.
Specifically, we propose to leverage the user-user interactions to alleviate
the sparsity issue of user-item interactions, and design a GNN-based
representation learning network to enhance the learning of individuals'
preferences from their friends' preferences, which provides a solid foundation
for learning groups' preferences. To exploit the group similarity to learn a
more accurate group representation from highly limited group-item interactions,
we connect all groups as a network of overlapping sets, and treat the task of
group preference learning as embedding hyperedges in a hypergraph, where an
inductive hyperedge embedding method is proposed. To further enhance the
group-level preference modeling, we develop a joint training strategy to learn
both user-item and group-item interactions in the same process. We conduct
extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and the experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HyperGroup in comparison to the
state-of-the-art baselines.

a solution of an infinite-dimensional variational inequality (VI) in Hilbert

real-world medical settings. A model that has high performance at one
institution may suffer a significant decline in performance when tested at
other institutions. While pooling datasets from multiple institutions and
retraining may provide a straightforward solution, it is often infeasible and
may compromise patient privacy. An alternative approach is to fine-tune the
model on subsequent institutions after training on the original institution.
Notably, this approach degrades model performance at the original institution,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we develop an
approach to address catastrophic forget-ting based on elastic weight
consolidation combined with modulation of batch normalization statistics under
two scenarios: first, for expanding the domain from one imaging system's data
to another imaging system's, and second, for expanding the domain from a large
multi-institutional dataset to another single institution dataset. We show that
our approach outperforms several other state-of-the-art approaches and provide

current absorbed from the hot bath). As a consequence, the ratio between the
fluctuations of the output and input currents are bounded both from above and
below, where the lower (upper) bound is determined by the square of the

comprehensive study on the transferability of learned representations of
different contrastive approaches for linear evaluation, full-network transfer,
and few-shot recognition on 12 downstream datasets from different domains, and
object detection tasks on MSCOCO and VOC0712. The results show that the
contrastive approaches learn representations that are easily transferable to a
different downstream task. We further observe that the joint objective of
self-supervised contrastive loss with cross-entropy/supervised-contrastive loss
leads to better transferability of these models over their supervised
counterparts. Our analysis reveals that the representations learned from the
contrastive approaches contain more low/mid-level semantics than cross-entropy
models, which enables them to quickly adapt to a new task. Our codes and models

rings is smooth and when the scfc cover is smooth. We also characterize when
the spectrum of the iteration coincides with the scfc cover. Finally, we give a

failures before their occurrence. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a method for predicting error states before the occurence of error,
thereby enabling timely recovery. Robotic snap joint assembly requires precise
positioning; therefore, even a slight offset between parts can lead to assembly
failure. To correctly predict error states, we apply functional principal
component analysis (fPCA) to 6D force/torque profiles that are terminated
before the occurence of an error. The error state is identified by applying a
feature vector to a decision tree, wherein the support vector machine (SVM) is
employed at each node. If the estimation accuracy is low, we perform additional
probing to more correctly identify the error state. Finally, after identifying
the error state, a robot performs the error recovery motion based on the
identified error state. Through the experimental results of assembling plastic
parts with four snap joints, we show that the error states can be correctly
estimated and a robot can recover from the identified error state.

equations which are too complex to solve analytically. In practical problems,
these equations are discretized on a computational domain, and numerical
solutions are computed. A numerical scheme is called convergent, if in the
limit of infinitesimal discretization, the bounds on the discretization error
is also infinitesimally small. The approximate solution converges to the ""true
solution"" in this limit. The Lax equivalence theorem enables a proof of
convergence given consistency and stability of the method. In this work, we
formally prove the Lax equivalence theorem using the Coq Proof Assistant. We
assume a continuous linear differential operator between complete normed
spaces, and define an equivalent mapping in the discretized space. Given that
the numerical method is consistent (i.e., the discretization error tends to
zero as the discretization step tends to zero), and the method is stable (i.e.,
the error is uniformly bounded), we formally prove that the approximate
solution converges to the true solution. We then demonstrate convergence of the
difference scheme on an example problem by proving both its consistency and
stability, and then applying the Lax equivalence theorem. In order to prove
consistency, we use the Taylor-Lagrange theorem by formally showing that the
discretization error is bounded above by the nth power of the discretization
step, where n is the order of the truncated Taylor polynomial.

achieving novel correlated and topological electronic phases in moir\'e
electronic crystals. However, although pioneering theoretical efforts have
predicted nontrivial magnetism and magnons out of twisting 2D magnets,
experimental realization of twist engineering spin degree of freedom remains
elusive. Here, we leverage the archetypal 2D Ising magnet chromium triiodide
(CrI3) to fabricate twisted double bilayer homostructures with tunable twist
angles and demonstrate the successful twist engineering of 2D magnetism in
them. Using linear and circular polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy, we
identify magneto-Raman signatures of a new magnetic ground state that is
sharply distinct from those in natural bilayer (2L) and four-layer (4L) CrI3.
With careful magnetic field and twist angle dependence, we reveal that, for a
very small twist angle (~ 0.5 degree), this emergent magnetism can be
well-approximated by a weighted linear superposition of those of 2L and 4L CI3
whereas, for a relatively large twist angle (~ 5 degree), it mostly resembles
that of isolated 2L CrI3. Remarkably, at an intermediate twist angle (~ 1.1
degree), its magnetism cannot be simply inferred from the 2L and 4L cases,
because it lacks sharp spin-flip transitions that are present in 2L and 4L CrI3
and features a dramatic Raman circular dichroism that is absent in natural 2L
and 4L ones. Our results demonstrate the possibility of designing and
controlling the spin degree of freedom in 2D magnets using twist engineering.

leverages this implicit hierarchy by imposing a hierarchical structure on the

outliers. We propose an end-to-end learning strategy for jointly updating the

is known that they remain underutilized due to various reasons. Recent advances
to incorporate static bug detectors in modern software development workflows
can better motivate developers to fix the reported warnings on the fly.
  In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art (SOA)
solution in tracking warnings by static bug detectors and propose a better
solution based on our analysis of the insufficiencies of the SOA solution. In
particular, we examined four large-scale open-source systems and crafted a data
set of 3,452 static code warnings by two static bug detectors. We manually
uncover the ground-truth evolution status of the selected warnings: persistent,
resolved, or newly-introduced. Moreover, upon manual analysis, we identified
the critical reasons behind the insufficiencies of the SOA matching algorithm.
Finally, we propose a better approach to improve the tracking of static
warnings over software development history. Our evaluation shows that our
proposed approach provides a significant improvement in the precision of the
tracking, i.e., from 66.9% to 90.0%.

mixed autonomy brings new challenges in dealing with congestion. One cause of
congestion is when vehicle users choose their routes selfishly to minimize
their personal travel delay rather than a global travel delay, and prior works
address this phenomenon using tolling to influence routing choices, but do not
address the setting of mixed autonomy. Tolls may be differentiated, meaning
different users of a road experience different tolls, or they may be anonymous;
the latter is desirable to allay concerns of fairness and privacy, as well as
logistical challenges. In this work we examine the role of differentiation in
traffic networks with mixed autonomy. Specifically, we first establish
differentiated tolls which completely eliminate inefficiency due to selfish
routing. We then show the fundamental limitations of anonymous tolls in our
setting, and we provide anonymous tolls with mild performance guarantees. We
show that in parallel networks, an infinitesimal differentiation in tolls is
enough to guarantee optimality, and finally we establish a lower bound on the

wearables), however, are either very costly, uncomfortable, or unreliable. In
this paper, we then propose to utilize everyday WiFi signals for robust, fast,

rigorous mathematical characterization for the spectral content/bandwidth of
the WiFi signal, measured on a WiFi device placed near a sleeping patient,
during different kinds of sleep motions: seizures, normal movements (e.g.
posture adjustments), and breathing. Based on this mathematical modeling, we
propose a novel pipeline for processing the received WiFi signals to robustly
detect all nocturnal non-breathing movements, and then classify them into
normal body movements or seizures. In order to validate this, we carry out
extensive experiments in 7 different typical bedroom locations, where a set of
20 actors simulate the state of having seizures (total of 260 instances), as
well as normal sleep movements (total of 410 instances). Our proposed system
detects 93.85% of the seizures with a mean response time of only 5.69 seconds

probability of false alarm of only 0.0097, when classifying normal sleep
movements. Overall, our new mathematical modeling and experimental results show
the great potential the ubiquitous WiFi signals have for detecting nocturnal
seizures, which can provide better support for epilepsy patients and their

the learning paradigm for SSL should be different from supervised learning and
the information encoded by the contrastive loss is expected to be much less

loss. Hence, we propose scaled-down self-supervised learning (S3L), which
include 3 parts: small resolution, small architecture and small data. On a
diverse set of datasets, SSL methods and backbone architectures, S3L achieves
higher accuracy consistently with much less training cost when compared to

and college. Making multiple predictions about students is an important part of
a smart campus. For instance, predicting whether a student will fail to
graduate can alert the student affairs office to take predictive measures to
help the student improve his/her academic performance. With the development of
information technology in colleges, we can collect digital footprints which
encode heterogeneous behaviors continuously. In this paper, we focus on
modeling heterogeneous behaviors and making multiple predictions together,
since some prediction tasks are related and learning the model for a specific
task may have the data sparsity problem. To this end, we propose a variant of
LSTM and a soft-attention mechanism. The proposed LSTM is able to learn the
student profile-aware representation from heterogeneous behavior sequences. The
proposed soft-attention mechanism can dynamically learn different importance
degrees of different days for every student. In this way, heterogeneous
behaviors can be well modeled. In order to model interactions among multiple
prediction tasks, we propose a co-attention mechanism based unit. With the help
of the stacked units, we can explicitly control the knowledge transfer among
multiple tasks. We design three motivating behavior prediction tasks based on a
real-world dataset collected from a college. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments on the three prediction tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness
of our model.

Considering that AI-based face manipulation often leads to high-frequency

With adversarial training, the classification models are forced to learn more

deployment of learning systems. However, unlike the widely used
class-conditional noise (CCN) assumption that the noisy label is independent of

be aleatory and heavily dependent on individual instances. In this work, we
investigate the instance-dependent noise (IDN) model and propose an efficient
approximation of IDN to capture the instance-specific label corruption.
Concretely, noting the fact that most columns of the IDN transition matrix have
only limited influence on the class-posterior estimation, we propose a
variational approximation that uses a single-scalar confidence parameter. To
cope with the situation where the mapping from the instance to its confidence
value could vary significantly for two adjacent instances, we suggest using
instance embedding that assigns a trainable parameter to each instance. The

both tasks to be optimized in a coordinated way, which maximizes the inner

network sizes have continued to grow. The popularity of BFS has brought with it
a need for significantly faster traversals. Thus, BFS algorithms have been
designed to exploit shared-memory and shared-nothing systems -- this includes
algorithms for accelerators such as the GPU. GPUs offer extremely fast
traversals at the cost of processing smaller graphs due to their limited memory
size. In contrast, CPU shared-memory systems can scale to graphs with several
billion edges but do not have enough compute resources needed for fast
traversals. This paper introduces ButterFly BFS, a multi-GPU traversal
algorithm that allows analyzing significantly larger networks at high rates.
ButterFly BFS scales to the similar-sized graphs processed by shared-memory

learned knowledge with extremely limited few-shot (support) examples, remains
an important open problem in computer vision. Most of the existing methods for
feature alignment in few-shot learning only consider image-level or
spatial-level alignment while omitting the channel disparity. Our insight is
that these methods would lead to poor adaptation with redundant matching, and
leveraging channel-wise adjustment is the key to well adapting the learned
knowledge to new classes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to learn a
dynamic alignment, which can effectively highlight both query regions and
channels according to different local support information. Specifically, this
is achieved by first dynamically sampling the neighbourhood of the feature
position conditioned on the input few shot, based on which we further predict a
both position-dependent and channel-dependent Dynamic Meta-filter. The filter
is used to align the query feature with position-specific and channel-specific
knowledge. Moreover, we adopt Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
enable a more accurate control of the alignment. In such a sense our model is
able to better capture fine-grained semantic context of the few-shot example
and thus facilitates dynamical knowledge adaptation for few-shot learning. The
resulting framework establishes the new state-of-the-arts on major few-shot

effectively suppress the noise and drift in electrical resistance upon memory
programming, largely reducing the inter-device variability. However, the
atomic-scale structural and chemical nature of PCH remains to be fully
understood. In this work, we carry out thorough ab initio simulations to assess
the bonding characteristics of the PCH. We show that the $TiTe_2$ crystalline
nanolayers do not chemically interact with the surrounding $Sb_2Te_3$, and are
stabilized by strong covalent and electrostatic Ti-Te interactions, which
create a prohibitively high barrier for atomic migrations along the pulsing
direction. We also find significant contrast in computed dielectric functions
in the PCH, suggesting possible optical applications of this class of devices.
With the more confined space and therefore constrained phase transition
compared to traditional PCM devices, the recently introduced class of PCH-based
devices may lead to improvements in phase-change photonic and optoelectronic
applications with much lower stochasticity during programming.

the mechanism of superconductivity in the high-$T_{c}$ cuprates. There is now
strong evidence that the strange metal behavior is induced by the quantum
critical fluctuation at the pseudogap end point, where the Fermi surface
changes its topology from hole-like to electron-like. However, experiments show
that the quantum critical behavior in the high-$T_{c}$ cuprates is
qualitatively different from that observed in the heavy Fermion systems and the
iron-based superconductors, in both of which the quantum critical behavior can
be attributed to the quantum phase transition toward a symmetry breaking phase.
The fact that the pseudogap exists as a spectral gap without a corresponding
symmetry breaking order, together with the fact that the strange metal behavior
occurs as a quantum critical behavior without a corresponding symmetry breaking
phase transition, exposes the central difficulty of the field: the lack of a
universal low energy effective theory description of the high-$T_{c}$
phenomenology beyond the Landau paradigm. Recent experiments imply that the
dualism between the local moment and the itinerant quasiparticle character of
the electron in the high-$T_{c}$ cuprates may serve as an organizing principle
to go beyond the Landau paradigm and may hold the key to the mystery of the
pseudogap phenomena and the strange metal behavior.

occur in a progenitor that is ultra-stripped due to binary interactions. Thus,
the secondary neutron star's mass as well as the post-supernova binary's
orbital parameters will depend on the nature of the collapsing progenitor core.
Since neutron stars are in the strong-gravity regime, their binding energy
makes up a significant fraction of their total mass-energy budget. The second
neutron star's binding energy may thus provide a unique insight as to whether
its progenitor was a low-mass iron core or an oxygen-neon-magnesium core. I
obtain relations for the baryonic mass and binding energy incorporating both a
hadronic equation-of-state catalog as well as recent multi-messenger
neutron-star observations. With these relations, I obtain the first tight
constraints on the baryonic mass and binding energy of three neutron stars that
are thought to have formed from an ultra-stripped progenitor. With these
constraints, I test if each neutron star is consistent with forming from an
ONeMg core that undergoes an electron-capture supernova. From these tests, I
find that this scenario can be ruled out for one of three neutron stars.
Neutron-star properties and the dense-matter equation of state can thus help
distinguish binary formation scenarios.

certain class labels being more similar to each other than others (e.g. images
of cats and dogs are more similar to each other than those of cats and cars).
Such similarity among classes is often the cause of poor model performance due
to the models confusing between them. Current labeling techniques fail to
explicitly capture such similarity information. In this paper, we instead
exploit the similarity between classes by capturing the similarity information
with our novel confidence labels. Confidence labels are probabilistic labels
denoting the likelihood of similarity, or confusability, between the classes.
Often even after models are trained to differentiate between classes in the
feature space, the similar classes' latent space still remains clustered. We
view this type of clustering as valuable information and exploit it with our
novel projective loss functions. Our projective loss functions are designed to
work with confidence labels with an ability to relax the loss penalty for
errors that confuse similar classes. We use our approach to train neural
networks with noisy labels, as we believe noisy labels are partly a result of
confusability arising from class similarity. We show improved performance
compared to the use of standard loss functions. We conduct a detailed analysis
using the CIFAR-10 dataset and show our proposed methods' applicability to

Therefore, the quadratic preserving Runge-Kutta method will preserve all the

pseudo-spectral spatial discretization, the scheme conserves the first and

Consequently, standard protocols applied to those systems result in unfaithful

assigned to most of the slender objects which leads to insufficient supervision
information for the slender objects during training and the performance on the
slender objects is hurt; (2) IoU can not accurately represent the alignment
degree between the receptive field of the feature at the anchor's center and
the object. Thus during training, some features whose receptive field aligns
better with objects are missing while some features whose receptive field
aligns worse with objects are adopted. This hurts the localization accuracy of

if a valid system descriptor is generated from an architectural diagram, then
the diagram is consistent. We report a case study to explore our hypotheses.
Furthermore, we constructed a system descriptor from the Netflix deployment

graphically represented in the generated architectural diagram, and the
generated diagram does not present inconsistent aspects of the original

from measurements of the $E$-mode polarization auto-power spectrum and the

primordial helium abundance, the effective number of relativistic degrees of
freedom, the sum of neutrino masses, the relativistic energy density and mass
of a sterile neutrino, and the mean spatial curvature. We do not find clear
evidence for any of these extensions, from either the SPT-3G 2018 dataset alone
or in combination with baryon acoustic oscillation and \textit{Planck} data.
None of these model extensions significantly relax the tension between
Hubble-constant, $H_0$, constraints from the CMB and from distance-ladder
measurements using Cepheids and supernovae. The addition of the SPT-3G 2018
data to \textit{Planck} reduces the square-root of the determinants of the
parameter covariance matrices by factors of $1.3 - 2.0$ across these models,
signaling a substantial reduction in the allowed parameter volume. We also
explore CMB-based constraints on $H_0$ from combined SPT, \textit{Planck}, and
ACT DR4 datasets. While individual experiments see some indications of
different $H_0$ values between the $TT$, $TE$, and $EE$ spectra, the combined
$H_0$ constraints are consistent between the three spectra. For the full
combined datasets, we report $H_0 = 67.49 \pm
0.53\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, which is the tightest constraint on $H_0$
from CMB power spectra to date and in $4.1\,\sigma$ tension with the most

image analysis. An automatic retinal vessel segmentation system can effectively
facilitate clinical diagnosis and ophthalmological research. Technically, this
problem suffers from various degrees of vessel thickness, perception of
details, and contextual feature fusion. For addressing these challenges, a deep
learning based method has been proposed and several customized modules have
been integrated into the well-known encoder-decoder architecture U-net, which
is mainly employed in medical image segmentation. Structurally, cascaded
dilated convolutional modules have been integrated into the intermediate
layers, for obtaining larger receptive field and generating denser encoded
feature maps. Also, the advantages of the pyramid module with spatial
continuity have been taken, for multi-thickness perception, detail refinement,
and contextual feature fusion. Additionally, the effectiveness of different
normalization approaches has been discussed in network training for different
datasets with specific properties. Experimentally, sufficient comparative
experiments have been enforced on three retinal vessel segmentation datasets,
DRIVE, CHASEDB1, and the unhealthy dataset STARE. As a result, the proposed
method outperforms the work of predecessors and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in Sensitivity/Recall, F1-score and MCC.

learning flexible non-parametric multi-action policies, while simultaneously
robustifying the policies against sources of error, by introducing and

combinatorial approach forces the policy to adapt to challenging situations,
enabling stable multi-action policies to be learned efficiently. The
effectiveness of our proposed method is evaluated through simulations and

manual counting methods, such as plate counting method, hemocytometry and
turbidimetry, are time-consuming, subjective and need complex operations, which

methods are efficient comparing with traditional plate counting methods. In
this article, we have studied the development of microorganism counting methods
using digital image analysis. Firstly, the microorganisms are grouped as
bacteria and other microorganisms. Then, the related articles are summarized
based on image segmentation methods. Each part of the article is reviewed by

microorganism counting are summarized and analyzed to find common technological
points. More than 144 papers are outlined in this article. In conclusion, this

related to the problem of numerical representation is the problem of
quantization: in what manner should a set of continuous real-valued numbers be
distributed over a fixed discrete set of numbers to minimize the number of bits
required and also to maximize the accuracy of the attendant computations? This
perennial problem of quantization is particularly relevant whenever memory
and/or computational resources are severely restricted, and it has come to the
forefront in recent years due to the remarkable performance of Neural Network
models in computer vision, natural language processing, and related areas.
Moving from floating-point representations to low-precision fixed integer
values represented in four bits or less holds the potential to reduce the
memory footprint and latency by a factor of 16x; and, in fact, reductions of 4x
to 8x are often realized in practice in these applications. Thus, it is not
surprising that quantization has emerged recently as an important and very
active sub-area of research in the efficient implementation of computations
associated with Neural Networks. In this article, we survey approaches to the
problem of quantizing the numerical values in deep Neural Network computations,
covering the advantages/disadvantages of current methods. With this survey and
its organization, we hope to have presented a useful snapshot of the current
research in quantization for Neural Networks and to have given an intelligent

one-dimensional asymmetric convolutions to intensify the square convolution

cells and low consumption of noble metals remains a major challenge. The
electrocatalysts based on metals or metal oxides which are used today are
limited by the complexity of their synthesis processes and require several
steps before depositing the catalysts on the substrate. Herein is described a
chemical synthesis process that consists of a single-step synthesis and direct
deposition of catalysts nanoparticles such as gold (Au), palladium (Pd) and
platinum (Pt) in the thickness of a carbon-fibers-based porous transport layer
(PTL). The synthesis process essentially consists of dissolving in the same
PGMEA (Propylene glycol methyl ether acetate) solvent a metal precursor (HAuCl4
or PdNO2 or PtCl4) and a homopolymer PMMA (Polymethylmetacrylate), then the
metal solution is deposited on the surface of the PTL after cleaning. Special
emphasis is made on Pt-based materials. The obtained PTL-supported
nanoparticles were firstly characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
to evaluate their morphology, and then X-Ray diffraction (XRD) to observe the
crystal phases. To validate the methodology, Pt-coated PTL materials have been
used as anode for the borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) in a direct
borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) and compared to a state-of-the-art nickel
electrode. There is an optimum loading of platinum (below 0.16 mg Pt/cm2) which
constitutes the best compromise between power density and faradic efficiency
for the borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR). Thanks to this low Pt loading,
hydrogen evolved during the anodic reaction is completely valorized. These
electrodes combine the advantages of high-performance with a very low metal
loading, hence lowering materials cost.

a hierarchy problem, just like the electroweak symmetry breaking in the
standard model. The dynamics of the axion, associated with the PQ symmetry
breaking, would also involve a triviality problem. We provide a paradigm to
resolve those two problems potentially existing in the PQ symmetry breaking
scenario, with keeping successful axion relaxation for the QCD strong CP phase.
The proposed theory includes an axicolor dynamics with the axicolored fermions
partially gauged by the QCD color, and is shown to be governed by an
asymptotically safe (AS) fixed point: quantum scale invariance is built. The AS
axicolor is actually a ``walking"" dynamics, which dynamically breaks a PQ
symmetry, a part of the chiral symmetry carried by the axicolored fermions. The
PQ scale generation is then triggered by the nonperturbative dimensional
transmutation in the ``walking"" dynamics. A composite axion emerges as the
assosiated Nambu-Goldstone boson. That is, no hierarchy or triviality problem
is present there. The composite axion can potentially be light due to the
characteristic feature of the AS axicolor (``walking"" axicolor), becomes the
QCD axion in the anti-Veneziano limit, and gets heavier by the subleading
correction. The composite axion relaxes the QCD theta parameter, involving
heavier relaxation partners such as axicolored pseudoscalar mesons, and the
ultraviolet correction to the relaxation mechanism is protected by the
established (near) scale invariance during the ``walking"" regime.

polaron transformation technique facilitates a treatment where diagonal
elements attributed to electronic excited-state populations are decoupled from
fluctuations associated with vibrational degrees-of-freedom. In this article we
describe for the first time how the polaron transformation can be applied in
the context of the ""Hierarchical Equations of Motion"" (HEOM) technique for
treatment of open quantum systems with all vibrational components attributed to
an environment. By using a generating function approach to introduce a shift in
the excited state potential energy surface, we derive hierarchical equations
for polaron transformation in analogy to those for time propagation. We
demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach by calculating the
dynamics of underdamped and overdamped oscillators coupled to electronic
excitation of a monomer without and with previous polaron transformation and
study the dynamics of the expectation value of the respective vibrational
coordinates. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of a dimer with a barrier
comparable to the thermal energy between the minima of the lower excitonic
potential energy surface. It turns out that the assumption of localization at
the monomer unit with energetically higher potential minimum, introduced via
polaron transformation, has a substantial influence on the transfer dynamics.
Here, it makes a clear difference whether the polaron transformation is
performed in the local or exciton basis. This reflects the fact that the
polaron transformation only accounts for equilibration of the vibrational, but
not of the excitonic dynamics. We sketch an approach to compensate this
shortcoming in view of obtaining an initial state for the calculation of
emission spectra of molecular aggregates.

Lefschetz thimble structure and properties of the large-flavor expansion for
the partition function obtained by the supersymmetric localization. We show
that the second-order phase transition is understood as a phenomenon where a
Stokes and anti-Stokes phenomenon occurs simultaneously. The order of the phase
transition is determined by how saddles collide at the critical point. In
addition, the phase transition accompanies an infinite number of Stokes
phenomena due to the supersymmetry. These features are appropriately mapped to
the Borel plane structures as the resurgence theory expects. Given the lessons
from the SQED, we provide a more general discussion on the relationship between

increases. As a consequence, the fraction of the narrow Drude weight
significantly decreases, indicating that Te substitution leads to stronger

reduction of the coherent carrier density, resulting from the Fermi-surface

performance for synthetic rainy images, typically rely on the pairs of sharp
images and simulated rainy counterparts. However, these methods suffer from
significant performance drop when facing the real rain, because of the huge gap
between the simplified synthetic rain and the complex real rain. In this work,
we argue that the rain generation and removal are the two sides of the same
coin and should be tightly coupled. To close the loop, we propose to jointly
learn real rain generation and removal procedure within a unified disentangled
image translation framework. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
disentangled translation network, in which each unidirectional network contains
two loops of joint rain generation and removal for both the real and synthetic
rain image, respectively. Meanwhile, we enforce the disentanglement strategy by
decomposing the rainy image into a clean background and rain layer (rain
removal), in order to better preserve the identity background via both the
cycle-consistency loss and adversarial loss, and ease the rain layer
translating between the real and synthetic rainy image. A counterpart
composition with the entanglement strategy is symmetrically applied for rain

the gel phase to the liquid crystalline phase between 320 K and 330 K in
agreement with experimental reports for pure PSPC. PSPC remained in the tilted
gel phase L\b{eta}$'$ at 320 K and 310 K, entered the 'mixed ordered' domain
with a partially interdigitated region at 300 K, and finally formed the sub gel
phase at 280 K. We studied the self-assembly for the multicomponent PSPC and
DSPE-PEG2000 membranes and found the coexistence of ordered and disordered
phases at 320 K. In comparison to the pure PSPC, for multicomponent system,
this transition was gradual, and a complete liquid crystalline to gel phase
transformation occurred between 320 K and 310 K. We further studied the
interaction of Paclitaxel with pure PSPC and PEGylated multicomponent lipid
bilayers using umbrella sampling technique and observed PEG promotes the
interaction of Paclitaxel with the later one in comparison to the former. Above
the bilayer transition temperature, Paclitaxel interacts more with the bilayer
and enters inside the bilayer easily for both systems. Understanding of

imaging and observation luminosity when the relevant physical parameters are
changed. For the different spherical accretions background, one can find that
the radius of shadow and the position of photon sphere do not change, but the
observation intensity of shadow in the infalling accretion model is
significantly lower than that of the static case. When the black hole is
surrounded by an optically and thin disk accretion, the contribution of the
photon rings, lensing rings and direct emission to the total observed flux has
also been studied. Under the different forms of the emission modes, the result
shows that the observed brightness is mainly determined by direct emission,
while the lensing rings will provide a small part of the observation flux and
the photon ring can provide a negligible observation flux. By comparing our
results with the Schwarzschild spacetime, it is found that the existence or
change of relevant status parameters will greatly affect the shape and
observation intensity of black hole shadow. These results support that the
change of state parameter will affect the spacetime structure, thus affecting
the observation feature of black hole shadows.

first turned into a localized metallic state with gradually suppressed magnetic

can easily manipulate videos without leaving prominent visual traces.
Frame-rate up-conversion (FRUC), a representative temporal-domain operation,
increases the motion continuity of videos with a lower frame-rate and is used
by malicious counterfeiters in video tampering such as generating fake
frame-rate video without improving the quality or mixing temporally spliced
videos. FRUC is based on frame interpolation schemes and subtle artifacts that
remain in interpolated frames are often difficult to distinguish. Hence,
detecting such forgery traces is a critical issue in video forensics. This
paper proposes a frame-rate conversion detection network (FCDNet) that learns
forensic features caused by FRUC in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed network
uses a stack of consecutive frames as the input and effectively learns
interpolation artifacts using network blocks to learn spatiotemporal features.
This study is the first attempt to apply a neural network to the detection of
FRUC. Moreover, it can cover the following three types of frame interpolation
schemes: nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, and
motion-compensated interpolation. In contrast to existing methods that exploit
all frames to verify integrity, the proposed approach achieves a high detection
speed because it observes only six frames to test its authenticity. Extensive
experiments were conducted with conventional forensic methods and neural
networks for video forensic tasks to validate our research. The proposed
network achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of detecting the
interpolated artifacts of FRUC. The experimental results also demonstrate that
our trained model is robust for an unseen dataset, unlearned frame-rate, and
unlearned quality factor.

  Optimal Runtime and Quality Guarantees for Graph Pattern Cardinality
  Estimation","17 pages",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph pattern cardinality estimation is the problem of estimating the number
of embeddings of a query graph in a data graph. This fundamental problem
arises, for example, during query planning in subgraph matching algorithms.
There are two major approaches to solving the problem: sampling and synopsis.
Synopsis (or summary)-based methods are fast and accurate if synopses capture
information of graphs well. However, these methods suffer from large errors due
to loss of information during summarization and inherent assumptions.
Sampling-based methods are unbiased but suffer from large estimation variance
due to large sample space.
  To address these limitations, we propose Alley, a hybrid method that combines
both sampling and synopses. Alley employs 1) a novel sampling strategy, random
walk with intersection, which effectively reduces the sample space, 2)
branching to further reduce variance, and 3) a novel mining approach that
extracts and indexes tangled patterns as synopses which are inherently
difficult to estimate by sampling. By using them in the online estimation
phase, we can effectively reduce the sample space while still ensuring
unbiasedness. We establish that Alley has worst-case optimal runtime and
approximation quality guarantees for any given error bound $\epsilon$ and
required confidence $\mu$. In addition to the theoretical aspect of Alley, our
extensive experiments show that Alley outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
by up to orders of magnitude higher accuracy with similar efficiency.

critical dimension is background independent, the classical on-shell effective
action of the bosonic string theory at order $\alpha'$ in a spacetime manifold
without boundary has been reproduced, up to an overall parameter, by imposing
the $O(1,1)$ symmetry when the background has a circle. In the presence of the
boundary, we consider a background which has boundary and a circle such that
the unit normal vector of the boundary is independent of the circle. Then the
$O(1,1)$ symmetry can fix the bulk action without using the lowest order
equation of motion. Moreover, the above constraints and the constraint from the
principle of the least action in the presence of boundary can fix the boundary
action, up to five boundary parameters. In the least action principle, we
assume that not only the values of the massless fields but also the values of
their first derivatives are arbitrary on the boundary.
  We have also observed that the cosmological/one-dimensional reduction of the
leading order action in the presence of the Hawking-Gibbons boundary term,
produces zero boundary action. Imposing this as another constraint on the
boundary couplings at order $\alpha'$, we find the boundary action up to two
parameters. For a specific value for these two parameters, the gravity
couplings in the boundary become the Chern-Simons gravity plus another term
which has the Laplacian of the extrinsic curvature.

examines the benefits of a physics-informed cluster analysis for the

choice of the dissimilarity measure for clustering is fundamental and highly
affects the performances of the local reduced-order bases. It is shown that
clustering with an angle-based dissimilarity on simulation data efficiently
decreases the intra-cluster Kolmogorov $N$-width. Additionally, an a priori

engineers with a very practical method for ROM-nets' hyperparameters

more target attributes, 2) are statistically robust, and 3) non-redundant. Many
attempts have been made to mine either locally robust subgroups or to tackle
the pattern explosion, but we are the first to address both challenges at the
same time from a global modelling perspective. First, we formulate the broad
model class of subgroup lists, i.e., ordered sets of subgroups, for univariate
and multivariate targets that can consist of nominal or numeric variables,
including traditional top-1 subgroup discovery in its definition. This novel
model class allows us to formalise the problem of optimal robust subgroup
discovery using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, where we resort
to optimal Normalised Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian encodings for nominal and
numeric targets, respectively. Second, finding optimal subgroup lists is
NP-hard. Therefore, we propose SSD++, a greedy heuristic that finds good
subgroup lists and guarantees that the most significant subgroup found
according to the MDL criterion is added in each iteration. In fact, the greedy
gain is shown to be equivalent to a Bayesian one-sample proportion,
multinomial, or t-test between the subgroup and dataset marginal target
distributions plus a multiple hypothesis testing penalty. Furthermore, we
empirically show on 54 datasets that SSD++ outperforms previous subgroup
discovery methods in terms of quality, generalisation on unseen data, and
subgroup list size.

MCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted

and halo CMEs are considered the most energetic in the sense that they are
usually faster and wider than the general population of CMEs. Hence the study
of RL and halo CMEs has become important and the prediction of their occurrence
rate in a future cycle will give a warning in advance. In the present paper,
the occurrence rates of RL and halo CMEs in solar cycle (SC) 25 are predicted.
For this, we obtained good correlations between the numbers of RL and halo CMEs
in each year and the yearly mean sunspot numbers in the previous two cycles.
The predicted values of sunspot numbers in SC 25 by NOAA/NASA were considered
as representative indices and the corresponding numbers of RL and halo CMEs
have been determined using linear relations. Our results show that the maximum
number of RL and halo CMEs will be around 39 $/pm$ 3 and 45 $/pm$ 4,
respectively. Removing backside events, a set of front-side events was also
considered separately and the front-side events alone in SC 25 are predicted
again. The peak values of front-side RL and halo events have been estimated to
be around 31 $/pm$ 3 and 29 $/pm$ 3 respectively. These results are discussed
in comparison with the predicted values of sunspots by different authors.

dedicated calibration strategy for astrometry implemented for SPHERE has
facilitated high-precision studies by its users since its start of operation in
2014. As the precision of exoplanet imaging instruments is now reaching
milliarcseconds and is expected to improve with the upcoming facilities, we
initiated a community effort, triggered by the SPHERE experience, to share
lessons learned for high-precision astrometry in direct imaging. A homogeneous

capacities of invertible neural networks for image classification to generate
counterfactual examples efficiently. In contrast to competing methods that
sometimes need a thousand evaluations or more of the classifier, ECINN has a
closed-form expression and generates a counterfactual in the time of only two

is to alter only input features that affect the predicted outcome, i.e.,
class-dependent features. Our experiments demonstrate how ECINN alters
class-dependent image regions to change the perceptual and predicted class of
the counterfactuals. Additionally, we extend ECINN to also produce heatmaps
(ECINNh) for easy inspection of, e.g., pairwise class-dependent changes in the
generated counterfactual examples. Experimentally, we find that ECINNh
outperforms established methods that generate heatmap-based explanations.

observed so far. 27% of the systems have three or more components. Given the
heterogeneity of the sample in terms of observing conditions and strategy,
tailored routines were used for data reduction and analysis, some of which were
specifically designed for these data sets. We then combined SPHERE data with
literature and archival ones, TESS light curves and Gaia parallaxes and proper
motions, to characterise these systems as completely as possible. Combining all
data, we were able to constrain the orbits of 25 systems. We carefully assessed
the completeness of our sample for the separation range 50-500 mas (period
range a few years - a few tens of years), taking into account the initial
selection biases and recovering part of the systems excluded from the original
list due to their multiplicity. This allowed us to compare the binary frequency
for our sample with previous studies and highlight some interesting trends in
the mass ratio and period distribution. We also found that, for the few objects
for which such estimate was possible, the values of the masses derived from
dynamical arguments were in good agreement with the model predictions. Stellar
and orbital spins appear fairly well aligned for the 12 stars having enough
data, which favour a disk fragmentation origin. Our results highlight the
importance of combining different techniques when tackling complex problems

media. We are interested in fluids presenting a specific change in rheology:
Newtonian below a certain shear rate and power law above. Since porous media
generally exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity at large geological scales, we
study the interaction between such inhomogeneity and the nonlinear rheology of
the fluid. The coupling between permeability heterogeneity and nonlinear
rheology significantly affects the flow. We are particularly in the statistical
properties of the velocity field (mean, variance, correlation, etc). Depending
on the imposed mean pressure gradient, three macroscopic flow regimes are
identified. For a low or high average pressure gradient, the average flow rate
increases linearly or according to a power law, respectively. In the latter
regime, we observe that the velocity field is more heterogeneous for
shear-thinning fluids than for shear-thickening fluids. This is corresponding
to a channeling effect of shear-thinning fluids. The intermediate regime
corresponds to a progressive and inhomogeneous change of the local rheology.
This transient regime is then characterized in terms of pressure gradient
range. The flow field is also analyzed statistically. The spatial distribution
of the regions above the rheology threshold shows interesting statistical
properties. For instance, they exhibit multiscale characteristics (fractal),
similar to other critical systems (percolation, avalanches, etc.).
  More surprisingly, even though some statistical properties are independent of
the parameters, an interesting abrupt rotation of the correlations is found for
a particular set of parameters. This is explained by using some symmetries of
the problem.

spatial features that help improve the discriminability of the model are often
overlooked. To handle the problems, this paper proposes a novel
spatial-spectral HSI classification method via multiple random anchor graphs
ensemble learning (RAGE). Firstly, the local binary pattern is adopted to
extract the more descriptive features on each selected band, which preserves
local structures and subtle changes of a region. Secondly, the adaptive
neighbors assignment is introduced in the construction of anchor graph, to
reduce the computational complexity. Finally, an ensemble model is built by
utilizing multiple anchor graphs, such that the diversity of HSI is learned.
Extensive experiments show that RAGE is competitive against the

Although there is a rich literature of self-supervised methods for either

existence of an explicit, global surface of section for the free region. This

electrons, the so-called Kondo lattice materials, provide a very rich backdrop
for strong electron correlations. They are known to realize many exotic
phenomena, including unconventional superconductivity, strange metals, and
correlated topological phases of matter. Here, we report what appears to be
electron fractionalization in insulating Kondo lattice material YbIr$_3$Si$_7$,
with emergent neutral excitations that carry heat but not electric current and
contribute to metal-like specific heat. We show that these neutral particles
change their properties as the material undergoes a transformation between two
antiferromagnetic phases in an applied magnetic field. In the low-field AF-I
phase, we find that the low temperature linear specific heat coefficient
$\gamma$ and the residual linear term in the thermal conductivity
$\kappa/T(T\rightarrow 0)$ are finite, demonstrating itinerant gapless
excitations. These results, along with a spectacular violation of the
Wiedemann-Franz law, directly indicate that YbIr$_3$Si$_7$ is a charge
insulator but a thermal metal. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum reveals a
spin-flop transition to a high field AF-II phase. Near the transition field,
$\gamma$ is significantly enhanced. Most surprisingly, inside the AF-II phase,
$\kappa/T$ exhibits a sharp drop below $\sim300$ mK, indicating either opening
of a tiny gap or a linearly vanishing density of states. This finding
demonstrates a transition from a thermal metal into an insulator/semimetal
driven by the spin-flop magnetic transition. These results suggest that spin
degrees of freedom directly couple to the neutral fermions, whose emergent
Fermi surface undergoes a field-driven instability at low temperatures.

The development of algorithms for autonomous navigation, mapping and
localization have seen big advancements over the past two decades. Nonetheless,
challenges remain in developing robust solutions for accurate localization in
dense urban environments, where the so called last-mile delivery occurs. In
these scenarios, local motion estimation is combined with the matching of
real-time data with a detailed pre-built map. In this paper, we utilize data
gathered with an autonomous delivery robot to compare different sensor fusion
techniques and evaluate which are the algorithms providing the highest accuracy
depending on the environment. The techniques we analyze and propose in this
paper utilize 3D lidar data, inertial data, GNSS data and wheel encoder
readings. We show how lidar scan matching combined with other sensor data can
be used to increase the accuracy of the robot localization and, in consequence,
its navigation. Moreover, we propose a strategy to reduce the impact on
navigation performance when a change in the environment renders map data

found 22 Moon intrusions, taken in 19 channels between 3.75 micron and 15.0
micron, and over a wide phase angle range from -73.1 deg to +73.8 deg. The
similarity between these Moon data and typical asteroid spectral-IR energy

fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors at 108 locations along the bridge
superstructure, statFEM can predict the `true' system response while taking
into account the uncertainties in sensor readings, applied loading and finite

the two main I-beams are both measured and modelled during the passage of a
passenger train. The digital twin, because of its physics-based component, is
able to generate reasonable strain distribution predictions at locations where
no measurement data is available, including at several points along the main

implications for long-term structural health monitoring and assessment include
optimisation of sensor placement, and performing more reliable what-if analyses

real algebraic geometry, polynomial system solving and symbolic computation.
Given a semi-algebraic formula (whose atoms are polynomial constraints) with
quantifiers on some variables, it consists in computing a logically equivalent
formula involving only unquantified variables. When there is no alternation of
quantifiers, one has a one block quantifier elimination problem.
  This paper studies a variant of the one block quantifier elimination in which
we compute an almost equivalent formula of the input. We design a new
probabilistic efficient algorithm for solving this variant when the input is a
system of polynomial equations satisfying some regularity assumptions. When the
input is generic, involves $s$ polynomials of degree bounded by $D$ with $n$
quantified variables and $t$ unquantified ones, we prove that this algorithm
outputs semi-algebraic formulas of degree bounded by $\mathcal{D}$ using $O\
{\widetilde{~}}\left ((n-s+1)\ 8^{t}\ \mathcal{D}^{3t+2}
\binom{t+\mathcal{D}}{t} \right )$ arithmetic operations in the ground field
where $\mathcal{D} = 2(n+s)\ D^s(D-1)^{n-s+1}\ \binom{n}{s}$. In practice, it

perform better than those using Contrastive loss. It is clear LightGBM (Triplet

describe the effect of a quantum environment on the dynamics of an open quantum
system. We apply the IF approach to describe quantum many-body dynamics in
isolated spin systems, viewing the system as an environment for its local
subsystems. While the IF can be computed exactly only in certain many-body
models, it generally satisfies a self-consistency equation, provided the
system, or an ensemble of systems, are translationally invariant. We view the
IF as a fictitious wavefunction in the temporal domain, and approximate it
using matrix-product states (MPS). This approach is efficient provided the
temporal entanglement of the IF is sufficiently low. We illustrate the
versatility of the IF approach by analyzing several models that exhibit a range
of dynamical behaviors, from thermalizing to many-body localized. In
particular, we study the non-equilibrium dynamics in the quantum Ising model in
both Floquet and Hamiltonian settings. We find that temporal entanglement
entropy may be significantly lower compared to the spatial entanglement and
analyze the IF in the continuous-time limit. We simulate the
thermodynamic-limit evolution of local observables in various regimes,
including the relaxation of impurities embedded in an infinite-temperature
chain, and the long-lived oscillatory dynamics of the magnetization associated
with the confinement of excitations. By incorporating disorder-averaging into
the formalism, we analyze discrete time-crystalline response using the IF
method. In this case, we find that the temporal entanglement entropy scales
logarithmically with evolution time. The IF approach offers a new lens on
many-body non-equilibrium phenomena, both in ergodic and non-ergodic regimes,
connecting the theory of open quantum systems theory to quantum statistical

local feature patterns to achieve more accurate adaptation results. These
methods heavily rely on the region proposal mechanisms and ROI-based
instance-level features to design fine-grained feature alignment modules with
respect to the foreground objects. However, for one-stage detectors, it is hard
or even impossible to obtain explicit instance-level features in the detection
pipelines. Motivated by this, we propose an Implicit Instance-Invariant Network
(I3Net), which is tailored for adapting one-stage detectors and implicitly
learns instance-invariant features via exploiting the natural characteristics
of deep features in different layers. Specifically, we facilitate the
adaptation from three aspects: (1) Dynamic and Class-Balanced Reweighting
(DCBR) strategy, which considers the coexistence of intra-domain and
intra-class variations to assign larger weights to those sample-scarce
categories and easy-to-adapt samples; (2) Category-aware Object Pattern
Matching (COPM) module, which boosts the cross-domain foreground objects
matching guided by the categorical information and suppresses the uninformative
background features; (3) Regularized Joint Category Alignment (RJCA) module,
which jointly enforces the category alignment at different domain-specific
layers with a consistency regularization. Experiments reveal that I3Net exceeds
the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

up impacting the Earth's atmosphere and producing bright fireballs that might
have associated shock waves or, in geometrically-favorable occasions excavate
craters that put them into unexpected hazardous scenarios. The astrometric
reduction of meteors and fireballs to infer their atmospheric trajectories and
heliocentric orbits involves a complex and tedious process that generally
requires many manual tasks. To streamline the process, we present a software
package called SPMN 3D Fireball Trajectory and Orbit Calculator (3D-FireTOC),
an automatic Python code for detection, trajectory reconstruction of meteors,
and heliocentric orbit computation from video recordings. The automatic
3D-FireTOC package comprises of a user interface and a graphic engine that
generates a realistic 3D representation model, which allows users to easily
check the geometric consistency of the results and facilitates scientific
content production for dissemination. The software automatically detects
meteors from digital systems, completes the astrometric measurements, performs
photometry, computes the meteor atmospheric trajectory, calculates the velocity
curve, and obtains the radiant and the heliocentric orbit, all in all
quantifying the error measurements in each step. The software applies
corrections such as light aberration, refraction, zenith attraction, diurnal
aberration and atmospheric extinction. It also characterizes the atmospheric
flight and consequently determines fireball fates by using the $\alpha - \beta$
criterion that analyses the ability of a fireball to penetrate deep into the
atmosphere and produce meteorites. We demonstrate the performance of the
software by analyzing two bright fireballs recorded by the Spanish Fireball and
Meteorite Network (SPMN).

kagome CsV3Sb5 under in-situ high pressures. For the initial SC-I phase, its Tc
is quickly enhanced from 3.5 K to 7.6 K and then totally suppressed at P~10
GPa. Further increasing the applied pressures, an SC-II phase emerges at P~15
GPa and persists up to 100 GPa. The Tc rapidly increases to the maximal value
of 5.2 K at P=53.6 GPa and rather slowly decreases to 4.7 K at P=100 GPa. A
two-dome-like variation of Tc in CsV3Sb5 is concluded here. The Raman
measurements demonstrate that weakening of E2g model and strengthening of A1g
model occur without phase transition as entering the SC-II phase, which is
supported by the results of phonon spectra calculations. Electronic structure
calculations reveal that exertion of pressure may bridge the gap of topological
surface nontrivial states near EF, i. e. Z2 invariant. Meanwhile, it enlarges
Fermi surface significantly, consistent with the increased carrier density. The
findings here point out the change of electronic structure and strengthened
electron-phonon coupling should be responsible for the pressure-induced

extensively for solving various image processing problems. When it comes to
video sequences, harnessing this force is even more beneficial due to the
temporal redundancy. In the context of image and video denoising, many
classically-oriented algorithms employ self-similarity, splitting the data into
overlapping patches, gathering groups of similar ones and processing these
together somehow. With the emergence of convolutional neural networks (CNN),
the patch-based framework has been abandoned. Most CNN denoisers operate on the
whole image, leveraging non-local relations only implicitly by using a large

self-similarity in the context of video denoising, while still relying on a
regular convolutional architecture. We introduce a concept of patch-craft

her PnL. We use the tools of stochastic optimal control and simplify the
initial multidimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation into a system of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) involving a Matrix Riccati ODE for which
classical existence theorems do not apply. By using \textit{a priori} estimates
obtained thanks to optimal control tools, we nevertheless prove an existence

theorem that provides a rigorous solution to the execution problem. Using
examples based on data from the foreign exchange and stock markets, we
eventually illustrate our results and discuss their implications for both

(TI) represents a new state of matter originated from the interplay between
topology and magnetism. The defining characteristics of the QAH ground state
are the quantized Hall resistivity ($\rho_{yx}$) and vanishing longitudinal
resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) in the absence of external magnetic field. A
fundamental question concerning the QAH effect is whether it is merely a
zero-magnetic-field quantum Hall (QH) effect, or if it can host unique quantum
phases and phase transitions that are unavailable elsewhere. The most dramatic
departure of the QAH systems from other QH systems lies in the strong magnetic
disorders that induce spatially random magnetization. Because disorder and
magnetism play pivotal roles in the phase diagram of two-dimensional electron
systems, the high degree of magnetic disorders in QAH systems may create novel
phases and quantum critical phenomena. In this work, we perform systematic
transport studies of a series of magnetic TIs with varied strength of magnetic
disorders. We find that the ground state of QAH effect can be categorized into
two distinct classes: the QAH insulator and anomalous Hall (AH) insulator
phases, as the zero-magnetic-field counterparts of the QH liquid and Hall
insulator in the QH systems. In the low disorder limit of the QAH insulator
regime, we observe a universal quantized longitudinal resistance $\rho_{xx} =
h/e^{2}$ at the coercive field. In the AH insulator regime, we find that a
magnetic field can drive it to the QAH insulator phase through a quantum
critical point with distinct scaling behaviors from that in the QH phase
transition. We propose that the transmission between chiral edge states at
domain boundaries, tunable by disorder and magnetic fields, is the key for
determining the QAH ground state.

in next generations of wireless networks (i.e., 5G and 6G), the low expected
profit prevents telecommunication providers from investing in such sparsely
populated areas. Hence, it is required to design and deploy cost efficient
alternatives for extending the cellular infrastructure to these regions. A
concrete mathematical model that characterizes and clearly captures the
aforementioned problem might be a key-enabler for studying the efficiency of
any potential solution. Unfortunately, the commonly used mathematical tools
that model large scale wireless networks are not designed to capture the
unfairness, in terms of cellular coverage, suffered by exurban and rural areas.
In big cities, in fact, cellular deployment is essentially capacity driven and
thus cellular base station densities are maximum in the town centers and
decline when getting far from them. In this paper, a new stochastic
geometry-based model is implemented in order to show the coverage spatial
variation among urban, suburban, and exurban settlements. Indeed, by
implementing inhomogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs) it is possible to
study the performance metrics in a realistic scenario where terrestrial base
stations (TBSs) are clustered around the urban center while outer aerial base
stations (ABSs) are uniformly distributed outside an urban exclusion zone.
Based on this, our simulation results can quantify the improvement, in terms of
coverage probability, that even a surprisingly low density of ABSs can bring to
peripheral regions depending on the extension of the exclusion zone, enabling

materials and shed light on useful properties of existing materials. A key
difficulty when applying ML in Materials Science is that experimental datasets
of material properties tend to be small. In this work we show how material
descriptors can be learned from the structures present in large scale datasets
of material simulations; and how these descriptors can be used to improve the
prediction of an experimental property, the energy of formation of a solid. The
material descriptors are learned by training a Graph Neural Network to regress
simulated formation energies from a material's atomistic structure. Using these
learned features for experimental property predictions outperforms existing
methods that are based solely on chemical composition. Moreover, we find that
the advantage of our approach increases as the generalization requirements of
the task are made more stringent, for example when limiting the amount of
training data or when generalizing to unseen chemical spaces.

non-singular matrix whose integral curves are formed by two sets of centralised
ellipses. Then it is natural to represent them as elements of Geometric Algebra
for Conics (GAC) and construct the switching path by calculating the switching
points, i.e. intersections and contact points. For this, we use symbolic
algebra operations, more precisely the wedge and inner products, that are
realisable by sums of products in the coordinate form. Therefore, no numerical
solver to the system of equations is needed. Indeed, the only operation that
may bring in an inaccuracy is a vector normalisation, i.e. square root
calculation. The resulting switching path is formed by pieces of ellipses that
are chosen respectively from the two sets of integral curves. The switching
points are either intersections in the first or final step of our algorithm, or
contact points. This choice guarantees optimality of the switching path with
respect to the number of switches. On two examples we demonstrate the search
for conics' intersections and, consequently, we describe a construction of a

application to systems with rational eigenvalues. This is in turn the basis for
obtaining a tractable approximation to the maximal admissible invariant sets.
In this work, it is also demonstrated that, in order for the problem to have a
solution, an invariant set (and moreover, an equilibrium set) must be contained
within the target zone. To assess the proposal, the so-obtained impulsive
invariant set is explicitly used in the formulation of a set-based model
predictive controller, with application to zone tracking. In this context,
specific MPC theory needs to be considered, as the target is not necessarily
stable in the sense of Lyapunov. A zone MPC formulation is proposed, which is
able to i) track an invariant set such that the uncontrolled propagation
fulfills the zone constraint at all times and ii) converge asymptotically to
the set of periodic orbits completely contained within the target zone.

(CoAP) because of its efficiency and seamless integrability in the existing
Internet infrastructure. One of the strategies that CoAP leverages to achieve
these characteristics is the usage of proxies. Unfortunately, in order for a
proxy to operate, it needs to terminate the (D)TLS channels between clients and
servers. Therefore, end-to-end confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of
the exchanged data cannot be achieved. In order to overcome this problem, an
alternative to (D)TLS was recently proposed by the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF). This alternative consists of two novel protocols: 1) Object
Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) providing authenticated
encryption for the payload data and 2) Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE
(EDHOC) providing the symmetric session keys required for OSCORE. In this
paper, we present the design of four firmware libraries for these protocols
especially targeted for constrained microcontrollers and their detailed
evaluation. More precisely, we present the design of uOSCORE and uEDHOC
libraries for regular microcontrollers and uOSCORE-TEE and uEDHOC-TEE libraries
for microcontrollers with a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), such as
microcontrollers featuring ARM TrustZone-M. Our firmware design for the later
class of devices concerns the fact that attackers may exploit common software
vulnerabilities, e.g., buffer overflows in the protocol logic, OS or
application to compromise the protocol security. uOSCORE-TEE and uEDHOC-TEE
achieve separation of the cryptographic operations and keys from the remainder
of the firmware, which could be vulnerable. We present an evaluation of our
implementations in terms of RAM/FLASH requirements, execution speed and energy
on a broad range of microcontrollers.

significance using random subsets of input data with 2-27 available inputs.
When all 28 inputs are available DFCN obtains an AUC of 0.924, higher than any

transferring expert knowledge, which is widely adopted in reinforcement

planning tasks, a challenging problem in deploying IL and RL methods is how to
generate and collect massive, broadly distributed data such that these methods
can generalize effectively. In this work, we solve this problem using our
proposed approach called {self-imitation learning by planning (SILP)}, where
demonstration data are collected automatically by planning on the visited
states from the current policy. SILP is inspired by the observation that
successfully visited states in the early reinforcement learning stage are
collision-free nodes in the graph-search based motion planner, so we can plan
and relabel robot's own trials as demonstrations for policy learning. Due to
these self-generated demonstrations, we relieve the human operator from the
laborious data preparation process required by IL and RL methods in solving
complex motion planning tasks. The evaluation results show that our SILP method
achieves higher success rates and enhances sample efficiency compared to
selected baselines, and the policy learned in simulation performs well in a
real-world placement task with changing goals and obstacles.

analysis, most notably for choosing the number of components in PCA.
Significant progress on this task was achieved using random matrix theory by
characterizing the spectral properties of large noise matrices. However,
utilizing such tools is not straightforward when the data matrix consists of
count random variables, e.g., Poisson, in which case the noise can be
heteroskedastic with an unknown variance in each entry. In this work, we
consider a Poisson random matrix with independent entries, and propose a simple
procedure termed \textit{biwhitening} for estimating the rank of the underlying
signal matrix (i.e., the Poisson parameter matrix) without any prior knowledge.
Our approach is based on the key observation that one can scale the rows and
columns of the data matrix simultaneously so that the spectrum of the
corresponding noise agrees with the standard Marchenko-Pastur (MP) law,
justifying the use of the MP upper edge as a threshold for rank selection.
Importantly, the required scaling factors can be estimated directly from the
observations by solving a matrix scaling problem via the Sinkhorn-Knopp
algorithm. Aside from the Poisson, our approach is extended to families of
distributions that satisfy a quadratic relation between the mean and the
variance, such as the generalized Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, gamma,
and many others. This quadratic relation can also account for missing entries
in the data. We conduct numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical
findings, and showcase the advantage of our approach for rank estimation in
challenging regimes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the favorable performance of
our approach on several real datasets of single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq), High-Throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (Hi-C), and
document topic modeling.

metric called Optimal Transport based Conditional Entropy (OTCE), to
analytically predict the transfer performance for supervised classification
tasks in such cross-domain and cross-task feature transfer settings. Our OTCE
score characterizes transferability as a combination of domain difference and
task difference, and explicitly evaluates them from data in a unified
framework. Specifically, we use optimal transport to estimate domain difference
and the optimal coupling between source and target distributions, which is then
used to derive the conditional entropy of the target task (task difference).
Experiments on the largest cross-domain dataset DomainNet and Office31

jet helicity. Using multi-epoch very large baseline interferometry (VLBI)
observations carried out in a framework of the MOJAVE (Monitoring Of Jets in

derived geometrical parameters of the jet helix. To reach an agreement between
the VLBI and photometric optical observation data, the jet component motion at
a small angle to the radial direction is necessary. Such non-radial motion is
observed and, together with the jet helical shape, can be naturally explained
by the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the parsec-scale

itself in differences between the peak flux values of the 12-year optical

can induce a GHz-scale splitting, weak fields are desirable to avoid noise in
experiments. Here, we provide two solutions to this outstanding challenge with
realistic data of well-studied AEL isotopes. In the first theory, the two
nuclear spin qubit states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are excited to Rydberg
states $|r\rangle$ with detuning $\Delta$ and 0, respectively, where a
MHz-scale detuning $\Delta$ arises from a weak magnetic field on the order of
1~G. With a proper ratio between $\Delta$ and $\Omega$, the qubit state
$|1\rangle$ can be fully excited to the Rydberg state while $|0\rangle$ remains
there. In the second theory, we show that by choosing appropriate intermediate
states a two-photon Rydberg excitation can proceed with only one nuclear spin
qubit state. The second theory is applicable whatever the magnitude of the
magnetic field is. These theories bring a versatile means for quantum
computation by combining the broad applicability of Rydberg blockade and the

surveillance and biometric forensics, refers to the problem of matching a
low-resolution (LR) probe face image against high-resolution (HR) gallery face
images. Existing shallow learning-based and deep learning-based methods focus
on mapping the HR-LR face pairs into a joint feature space where the resolution
discrepancy is mitigated. However, little works consider how to extract and
utilize the intermediate discriminative features from the noisy LR query faces
to further mitigate the resolution discrepancy due to the resolution
limitations. In this study, we desire to fully exploit the multi-level deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) feature set for robust CRFR. In particular,
our contributions are threefold. (i) To learn more robust and discriminative
features, we desire to adaptively fuse the contextual features from different
layers. (ii) To fully exploit these contextual features, we design a feature
set-based representation learning (FSRL) scheme to collaboratively represent
the hierarchical features for more accurate recognition. Moreover, FSRL
utilizes the primitive form of feature maps to keep the latent structural
information, especially in noisy cases. (iii) To further promote the
recognition performance, we desire to fuse the hierarchical recognition outputs
from different stages. Meanwhile, the discriminability from different scales
can also be fully integrated. By exploiting these advantages, the efficiency of
the proposed method can be delivered. Experimental results on several face
datasets have verified the superiority of the presented algorithm to the other
competitive CRFR approaches.

Group score-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Group-CAM), which adopts the
""split-transform-merge"" strategy to generate saliency maps. Specifically, for
an input image, the class activations are firstly split into groups. In each
group, the sub-activations are summed and de-noised as an initial mask. After
that, the initial masks are transformed with meaningful perturbations and then
applied to preserve sub-pixels of the input (i.e., masked inputs), which are
then fed into the network to calculate the confidence scores. Finally, the
initial masks are weighted summed to form the final saliency map, where the
weights are confidence scores produced by the masked inputs. Group-CAM is
efficient yet effective, which only requires dozens of queries to the network
while producing target-related saliency maps. As a result, Group-CAM can be
served as an effective data augment trick for fine-tuning the networks. We
comprehensively evaluate the performance of Group-CAM on common-used
benchmarks, including deletion and insertion tests on ImageNet-1k, and pointing
game tests on COCO2017. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
Group-CAM achieves better visual performance than the current state-of-the-art

to plan in POMDPs--Active Inference Tree Search (AcT)--that combines the
normative character and biological realism of a leading planning theory in
neuroscience (Active Inference) and the scalability of tree search methods in
AI. This unification enhances both approaches. On the one hand, tree searches
enable the biologically grounded, first principle method of active inference to
be applied to large-scale problems. On the other hand, active inference
provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which
is often addressed heuristically in tree search methods. Our simulations show
that AcT successfully navigates binary trees that are challenging for
sampling-based methods, problems that require adaptive exploration, and the
large POMDP problem 'RockSample'--in which AcT reproduces state-of-the-art
POMDP solutions. Furthermore, we illustrate how AcT can be used to simulate
neurophysiological responses (e.g., in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex)
of humans and other animals that solve large planning problems. These numerical

external devices by providing discrete control signals to the actuator. A
continuous kinematic reconstruction from EEG signal is better suited for
practical BCI applications. The state-of-the-art multi-variable linear
regression (mLR) method provides a continuous estimate of hand kinematics,
achieving maximum correlation of upto 0.67 between the measured and the
estimated hand trajectory. In this work, three novel source aware deep learning
models are proposed for motion trajectory prediction (MTP). In particular,
multi layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network - long short term

presented. Additional novelty of the work includes utilization of brain source
localization (using sLORETA) for the reliable decoding of motor intention

between data groups divided by specific features (e.g., gender, region, race).
We propose to simulate judges from different groups with legal judgment
prediction (LJP) models and measure the judicial inconsistency with the
disagreement of the judgment results given by LJP models trained on different
groups. Experimental results on the synthetic data verify the effectiveness of
LInCo. We further employ LInCo to explore the inconsistency in real cases and
come to the following observations: (1) Both regional and gender inconsistency
exist in the legal system, but gender inconsistency is much less than regional
inconsistency; (2) The level of regional inconsistency varies little across
different time periods; (3) In general, judicial inconsistency is negatively
correlated with the severity of the criminal charges. Besides, we use LInCo to
evaluate the performance of several de-bias methods, such as adversarial
learning, and find that these mechanisms can effectively help LJP models to
avoid suffering from data bias.

model in a target domain where labeled data are not available by leveraging
information from annotated data in a source domain. Most deep UDA approaches
operate in a single-source, single-target scenario, i.e. they assume that the
source and the target samples arise from a single distribution. However, in
practice most datasets can be regarded as mixtures of multiple domains. In
these cases, exploiting traditional single-source, single-target methods for
learning classification models may lead to poor results. Furthermore, it is
often difficult to provide the domain labels for all data points, i.e. latent
domains should be automatically discovered. This paper introduces a novel deep
architecture which addresses the problem of UDA by automatically discovering
latent domains in visual datasets and exploiting this information to learn
robust target classifiers. Specifically, our architecture is based on two main
components, i.e. a side branch that automatically computes the assignment of
each sample to its latent domain and novel layers that exploit domain
membership information to appropriately align the distribution of the CNN
internal feature representations to a reference distribution. We evaluate our
approach on publicly available benchmarks, showing that it outperforms
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

Dominant instances are found via a RANSAC-like sampling and a consolidation
process driven by a model quality function considering previously proposed
instances. New ones are found by clustering in the consensus space. This new
formulation leads to a simple iterative algorithm with state-of-the-art
accuracy while running in real-time on a number of vision problems - at least
two orders of magnitude faster than the competitors on two-view motion
estimation. Also, we propose a deterministic sampler reflecting the fact that
real-world data tend to form spatially coherent structures. The sampler returns
connected components in a progressively densified neighborhood-graph. We
present a number of applications where the use of multiple geometric models
improves accuracy. These include pose estimation from multiple generalized
homographies; trajectory estimation of fast-moving objects; and we also propose
a way of using multiple homographies in global SfM algorithms. Source code:

non-standard if it can be generated in a non-cyclic way (that is, not in the

tackle these problem, a transmit beamspace (TB) Doppler division multiple

test function based on sequential detection is developed to mitigate the
Doppler ambiguity in DDMA waveform. Then, a discrete Fourier transform
(DFT)-based TB in slow-time is formed.The proposed method can achieve waveform
diversity in Doppler domain and generate a TB in slow-time that concentrates
the transmitted power in a fixed spatial region to improve the transmit energy
distribution for automotive MIMO radar, which is favored by medium/long range
radar (MRR/LRR) applications. As compared to the conventional TDMA technique,
the proposed TB DDMA approach can fully exploit the transmission capabilities
of all transmit elements to ensure that the emitted power is efficiently used

stellar magnetic activity. Although this emission, quantified via the S-index,
has been serving as a prime proxy of stellar magnetic activity for several
decades, many aspects of the complex relation between stellar magnetism and Ca
II H & K emission are still unclear. The amount of measured Ca II H & K
emission is suspected to be affected not only by the stellar intrinsic
properties but also by the inclination angle of the stellar rotation axis.
Until now such an inclination effect on S-index has remained largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we develop a physics-based model to calculate
S-index, focusing on the Sun. Using the distributions of solar magnetic
features derived from observations together with Ca II H & K spectra
synthesized in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium, we validate our model by
successfully reconstructing the observed variations of solar S-index over four
activity cycles. Further, using the distribution of magnetic features over the
visible solar disk obtained from surface flux transport simulations, we obtain
S-index time series dating back to 1700 and investigate the effect of
inclination on S-index variability, both on the magnetic activity cycle and the
rotational timescales. We find that when going from an equatorial to a pole-on
view, the amplitude of S-index variations decreases weakly on the activity
cycle timescale and strongly on the rotational timescale (by about 22% and 81%,
respectively, for a cycle of intermediate strength). The absolute value of
S-index depends only weakly on the inclination. We provide analytical
expressions that model such dependencies.

extended to flow configurations where the transition process depends on a large
set of parameters. In comparison, neural network methods allow higher
dimensional input features to be considered without compromising the efficiency
and accuracy of the traditional data driven models. Neural network methods
proposed earlier follow a cumbersome methodology of predicting instability
growth rates over a broad range of frequencies, which are then processed to
obtain the N-factor envelope, and then, the transition location based on the
correlating N-factor. This paper presents an end-to-end transition model based
on a recurrent neural network, which sequentially processes the mean
boundary-layer profiles along the surface of the aerodynamic body to directly
predict the N-factor envelope and the transition locations over a
two-dimensional airfoil. The proposed transition model has been developed and
assessed using a large database of 53 airfoils over a wide range of chord
Reynolds numbers and angles of attack. The sequence-to-sequence transduction
model proposed herein provides a more direct approach for accurate predictions
of the transition location than the earlier neural network methods, which
predict the local amplification rate of a single instability mode at a fixed
location along the airfoil. The large universe of airfoils encountered in
various applications causes additional difficulties. As such, we provide
further insights on selecting training datasets from large amounts of available
data.

The first method uses the so-called geomagnetically quiet days to calculate
S-type variations as daily means resulting in the data sub-set named IQD Sq and
SD. The second method uses the principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose
the original series into main variability modes. The first three modes produced
by PCA and explaining up to 98 per cent of the variability of the raw data are
in the data sub-set named PCA modes. Both methods allow to extract regular

location near the mean latitude of the ionospheric Sq current vortex focus
allows studying its variability using the S-type regular variations of the

  appears in Bernoulli (2023)",,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a random vector $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{\Sigma}^{1/2}\mathbf{x}$, where
the $p$ elements of the vector $\mathbf{x}$ are i.i.d. real-valued random
variables with zero mean and finite fourth moment, and $\mathbf{\Sigma}^{1/2}$
is a deterministic $p\times p$ matrix such that the spectral norm of the
population correlation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ of $\mathbf{y}$ is uniformly
bounded. In this paper, we find that the log determinant of the sample
correlation matrix $\hat{\mathbf{R}}$ based on a sample of size $n$ from the
distribution of $\mathbf{y}$ satisfies a CLT (central limit theorem) for
$p/n\to \gamma\in (0, 1]$ and $p\leq n$. Explicit formulas for the asymptotic
mean and variance are provided. In case the mean of $\mathbf{y}$ is unknown, we
show that after recentering by the empirical mean the obtained CLT holds with a
shift in the asymptotic mean. This result is of independent interest in both
large dimensional random matrix theory and high-dimensional statistical
literature of large sample correlation matrices for non-normal data. At last,
the obtained findings are applied for testing of uncorrelatedness of $p$ random
variables. Surprisingly, in the null case $\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{I}$, the test
statistic becomes completely pivotal and the extensive simulations show that
the obtained CLT also holds if the moments of order four do not exist at all,
which conjectures a promising and robust test statistic for heavy-tailed
high-dimensional data.

inference with discrete random variables. Recently, WMC has been extended to
weighted model integration (WMI) in order to additionally handle continuous
variables. At their core, WMI problems consist of computing integrals and sums
over weighted logical formulas. From a theoretical standpoint, WMI has been
formulated by patching the sum over weighted formulas, which is already present
in WMC, with Riemann integration. A more principled approach to integration,
which is rooted in measure theory, is Lebesgue integration. Lebesgue
integration allows one to treat discrete and continuous variables on equal
footing in a principled fashion. We propose a theoretically sound measure
theoretic formulation of weighted model integration, which naturally reduces to
weighted model counting in the absence of continuous variables. Instead of
regarding weighted model integration as an extension of weighted model
counting, WMC emerges as a special case of WMI in our formulation.

reconnaissance, exploitations, and obfuscation techniques to penetrate through
well protected enterprise networks. The discovery and detection of attacks,
though needing continuous efforts, is no longer sufficient. Security Operation
Center (SOC) analysts are overwhelmed by the significant volume of intrusion
alerts without being able to extract actionable intelligence. Recognizing this
challenge, this paper describes the advances and findings through deploying
ASSERT to process intrusion alerts from OmniSOC in collaboration with the
Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research (CACR) at Indiana University. ASSERT
utilizes information theoretic unsupervised learning to extract and update
`attack models' in near real-time without expert knowledge. It consumes
streaming intrusion alerts and generates a small number of statistical models
for SOC analysts to comprehend ongoing and emerging attacks in a timely manner.
This paper presents the architecture and key processes of ASSERT and discusses
a few real-world attack models to highlight the use-cases that benefit SOC
operations. The research team is developing a light-weight containerized ASSERT
that will be shared through a public repository to help the community combat
the overwhelming intrusion alerts.

by most cosmological studies. The expansion rate $H_0$ is thought to be
spatially constant, while bulk flows are often presumed to be negligible
compared to the Hubble expansion, even at local scales. Their effects on the
redshift-distance conversion are hence usually ignored. Any deviation from this
consensus can strongly bias the results of such studies and thus the importance
of testing these assumptions cannot be understated. Scaling relations of galaxy
clusters can be effectively used for that. In previous works, we observed
strong anisotropies in cluster scaling relations, whose origins remain
ambiguous. By measuring many different cluster properties, several scaling
relations with different sensitivities can be built. Nearly independent tests
of cosmic isotropy and bulk flows are then feasible. We make use of up to 570
clusters with measured properties at X-ray, microwave, and infrared
wavelengths, to construct 10 different cluster scaling relations (five of them
presented for the first time) and test the isotropy of the local Universe.
Through rigorous tests, we ensure that our analysis is not prone to generally
known systematic biases and X-ray absorption issues. By combining all available
information, we detect an apparent $9\%$ spatial variation in the local $H_0$
between $(l,b)\sim
({280^{\circ}}^{+35^{\circ}}_{-35^{\circ}},{-15^{\circ}}^{+20^{\circ}}_{-20^{\circ}})$
and the rest of the sky. The observed anisotropy has a nearly dipole form.
Using Monte Carlo simulations, we assess the statistical significance of the
anisotropy to be $>5\sigma$. This result could also be attributed to a $\sim
900$ km/s bulk flow which seems to extend out to at least $\sim 500$ Mpc. These
two effects are indistinguishable until more high$-z$ clusters are observed by
future all-sky surveys, such as eROSITA.

vehicles. They achieve impressive performance by reaping information from high
amounts of labeled data. Yet, the full complexity of the real world cannot be
encapsulated in the training data, no matter how big the dataset, and DNNs can
hardly generalize to unseen conditions. Robustness to various image
corruptions, caused by changing weather conditions or sensor degradation and
aging, is crucial for safety when such vehicles are deployed in the real world.
We address this problem through a novel type of layer, dubbed StyleLess, which
enables DNNs to learn robust and informative features that can cope with
varying external conditions. We propose multiple variations of this layer that
can be integrated in most of the architectures and trained jointly with the
main task. We validate our contribution on typical autonomous-driving tasks
(detection, semantic segmentation), showing that in most cases, this approach
improves predictive performance on unseen conditions (fog, rain), while
preserving performance on seen conditions and objects.

handled via an expectation within the loss function. Depending on the way this
is motivated, the discriminator is either required to be Lipschitz-1 in both or
in only one of its arguments. For the weaker requirement to become usable one
needs to exchange a supremum and an expectation. This is a mathematically
perilous operation, which is, so far, only partially justified in the
literature. This short mathematical note intends to fill this gap and provides
the mathematical rationale for discriminators that are only partially
Lipschitz-1 for cases where this approach is more appropriate or successful.

reweighting, we study the dynamic and static correlations that give rise to an
electric field-dependent ionic conductivity in electrolyte solutions. We
consider solutions modeled with both implicit and explicit solvents, with
different dielectric properties, and at multiple concentrations. Implicit
solvent models at low concentrations and small dielectric constants exhibit
strongly field-dependent conductivities. We compared these results to the
Onsager-Wilson theory of the Wien effect, which provides a qualitatively
consistent prediction at low concentrations and high static dielectric
constants, but is inconsistent away from these regimes. The origin of the
discrepancy is found to be increased ion correlations under these conditions.
Explicit solvent effects act to suppress nonlinear responses, yielding a weakly
field-dependent conductivity over the range of physically realizable field
strengths. By decomposing the relevant time correlation functions, we find that
the insensitivity of the conductivity to the field results from the persistent
frictional forces on the ions from the solvent. Our findings illustrate the
utility of nonequilibrium response theory in rationalizing nonlinear transport
behavior.

incompressible fluid occupying a bounded domain dates back to Yudovich in 1966.
  In this model, on the one hand, the normal component of the fluid velocity is
prescribed on the boundary and is nonzero on an open subset of the boundary,
corresponding either to sources (where the flow is incoming) or to sinks (where
the flow is outgoing). On the other hand the vorticity of the fluid which is
entering into the domain from the sources is prescribed.
  In this paper we investigate the existence of weak solutions to this system
by relying on \textit{a priori} bounds of the vorticity, which satisfies a
transport equation associated with the fluid velocity vector field. Our results
cover the case where the vorticity has a $L^p$ integrability in space, with $p
$ in $[1,+\infty]$, and prove the existence of solutions obtained by
compactness methods from viscous approximations. More precisely we prove the
existence of solutions which satisfy the vorticity equation in the
distributional sense in the case where $p >\frac43$, in the renormalized sense
in the case where $p >1$, and in a symmetrized sense in the case where $p =1$.

information from both the spatial and temporal dimensions of an input video.
Methods that reach State of the Art (SotA) accuracy, usually make use of 3D
convolution layers as a way to abstract the temporal information from video
frames. The use of such convolutions requires sampling short clips from the
input video, where each clip is a collection of closely sampled frames. Since
each short clip covers a small fraction of an input video, multiple clips are
sampled at inference in order to cover the whole temporal length of the video.
This leads to increased computational load and is impractical for real-world
applications. We address the computational bottleneck by significantly reducing
the number of frames required for inference. Our approach relies on a temporal
transformer that applies global attention over video frames, and thus better
exploits the salient information in each frame. Therefore our approach is very
input efficient, and can achieve SotA results (on Kinetics dataset) with a
fraction of the data (frames per video), computation and latency. Specifically
on Kinetics-400, we reach $80.5$ top-1 accuracy with $\times 30$ less frames
per video, and $\times 40$ faster inference than the current leading method.

determine that the phase replacing the clean one is a paramagnet polarized in
the nematic glass order with non-trivial magnetic response. This is because
disorder also induces non-collinear spin-vortex-crystal order and produces a
conjugated transverse dipolar random field. As a result of these many competing
effects, the associated magnetic susceptibilities are non-monotonic functions
of the temperature. As a further application of our methods, we show the
generation of random axes in other frustrated magnets with broken SU(2)

transfer the knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target
domain for person matching. One challenge is how to generate target domain
samples with reliable labels for training. To address this problem, we propose
a Disentanglement-based Cross-Domain Feature Augmentation (DCDFA) strategy,
where the augmented features characterize well the target and source domain
data distributions while inheriting reliable identity labels. Particularly, we
disentangle each sample feature into a robust domain-invariant/shared feature
and a domain-specific feature, and perform cross-domain feature recomposition
to enhance the diversity of samples used in the training, with the constraints
of cross-domain ReID loss and domain classification loss. Each recomposed
feature, obtained based on the domain-invariant feature (which enables a
reliable inheritance of identity) and an enhancement from a domain specific
feature (which enables the approximation of real distributions), is thus an
""ideal"" augmentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Generative adversarial approaches could alleviate this challenge by generating
a large number of possible scanpaths for unseen images. Existing methods for

360$^\circ$ images. We present ScanGAN360, a new generative adversarial
approach to address this challenging problem. Our network generator is tailored
to the specifics of 360$^\circ$ images representing immersive environments.
Specifically, we accomplish this by leveraging the use of a spherical
adaptation of dynamic-time warping as a loss function and proposing a novel
parameterization of 360$^\circ$ scanpaths. The quality of our scanpaths
outperforms competing approaches by a large margin and is almost on par with
the human baseline. ScanGAN360 thus allows fast simulation of large numbers of
virtual observers, whose behavior mimics real users, enabling a better
understanding of gaze behavior and novel applications in virtual scene design.

  A Conceptual Review from Neurobiology to Social Interaction",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The computational underpinnings of positive psychotic symptoms have recently
received significant attention. Candidate mechanisms include some combination
of maladaptive priors and reduced updating of these priors during perception. A
potential benefit of models with such mechanisms is their ability to link
multiple levels of explanation. This is key to improving how we understand the
experience of psychosis. Moreover, it points us towards more comprehensive
avenues for therapeutic research by providing a putative mechanism that could
allow for the generation of new treatments from first principles. In order to
demonstrate this, our conceptual paper will discuss the application of the
insights from previous computational models to an important and complex set of
evidence-based clinical interventions with strong social elements, such as
coordinated specialty care clinics in early psychosis and assertive community
treatment. These interventions may include but also go beyond
psychopharmacology, providing, we argue, structure and predictability for
patients experiencing psychosis. We develop the argument that this structure
and predictability directly counteract the relatively low precision afforded to
sensory information in psychosis, while also providing the patient more access
to external cognitive resources in the form of providers and the structure of
the programs themselves. We discuss how computational models explain the
resulting reduction in symptoms, as well as the predictions these models make
about potential responses of patients to modifications or to different
variations of these interventions. We also link, via the framework of
computational models, the experiences of patients and response to interventions
to putative neurobiology.

kinematical regime where the momentum transfer from the proton to the pion is
space-like and extrapolate our final results to the regime that is relevant for
proton decay. In this way, we obtain estimates for the form factors that show
agreement with the state-of-the-art calculations in lattice QCD, if systematic
uncertainties are taken into account. Our work is a first step towards
calculating more involved proton decay channels where lattice QCD results are

Leveraging machine learning algorithms (ML) we expand simulation volumes that
successfully replicate halo populations beyond the training set. Training ML on
the Illustris-TNG300 simulation that includes baryonic physics, we populate the
larger LEGACY Expanse dark matter-only box with quasars. Our first science
results comparing observational and ML simulated quasars at $z \sim 3$, reveal
that while the recovered Black Hole Mass Functions and clustering are in good

observed mass growth. QUOTAS, demonstrates the power of ML, both for analyzing
large complex datasets, and offering a unique opportunity to interrogate our

it is vital for stakeholders to access faithful and useful power flow data,

This paper significantly extends this existing work. First, we reduce the
potential leakage information by proposing a fundamentally different
post-processing method, using public information of grid losses rather than
power dispatch, which achieve a higher level of privacy protection. Second, we
protect more sensitive parameters, i.e., branch shunt susceptance in addition
to series impedance (complete pi-model). This protects power flow data for the
transmission high-voltage networks, using differentially private
transformations that maintain the optimal power flow consistent with, and
faithful to, expected model behaviour. Third, we tested our approach at a
larger scale than previous work, using the PGLib-OPF test cases [10]. This
resulted in the successful obfuscation of up to a 4700-bus system, which can be
successfully solved with faithfulness of parameters and good utility to data

provides higher than state-of-the-art privacy guarantees, while maintaining

pose a simple game-theoretic model of a global pandemic in which individuals

emerge as a result of individuals reacting locally to the competing costs of
isolation and infection. We study the game-theoretic equilibria that emerge
from this setup when the population is composed of either selfish or altruistic
individuals. First, we demonstrate that as is typical in these types of games,
selfish equilibria are in general not optimal, but that all stable selfish
equilibria are within a constant factor of optimal. Second, there exist
infinitely-many stable altruistic equilibria; all but finitely-many of these
are worse than the worst selfish equilibrium, and the social cost of altruistic
equilibria is unbounded. Our work is in sharp contrast to recent work in
network congestion games in which all altruistic equilibria are socially
optimal. This suggests that a population without central coordination may react
very poorly to a pandemic, and that individual altruism could even exacerbate

integro-differential equations, are ubiquitous in engineering and science,
making it possible to understand or design systems for which physical
experiments would be expensive-sometimes impossible-to carry out. Such models
usually construct an approximate solution of the underlying continuous
equations, using discretization methods such as finite differences or the
finite elements method. The resulting discretization error introduces a form of
uncertainty on the exact but unknown value of any quantity of interest (QoI),
which affects the predictions of the numerical model alongside other sources of
uncertainty such as parametric uncertainty or model inadequacy. The present
article deals with the quantification of this discretization uncertainty.A
first approach to this problem, now standard in the V\&V (Verification and
Validation) literature, uses the grid convergence index (GCI) originally
proposed by P. Roache in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which
is based on the Richardson extrapolation technique. Another approach, based on
Bayesian inference with Gaussian process models, was more recently introduced
in the statistical literature. In this work we present and compare these two
paradigms for the quantification of discretization uncertainty, which have been
developped in different scientific communities, and assess the potential of
the-younger-Bayesian approach to provide a replacement for the well-established
GCI-based approach, with better probabilistic foundations. The methods are
illustrated and evaluated on two standard test cases from the literature
(lid-driven cavity and Timoshenko beam).

cross-feature spatial interaction between air pollution and important urban

achieves a higher accuracy than our baseline models. Our model attains an
accuracy of 67.6%, 77.2%, and 66.1% in fine-grained hourly estimation, 1-hr,

well as locally-varying affinities between audio and visual streams. Given that
the global term provides stability over a temporal sequence at the
utterance-level, this resolves the label permutation problem characterized by
inconsistent assignments. By extending the proposed cross-modal affinity on the

digital product description will automatically perform assembly planning and
orchestrate the production resources in a manufacturing cell. Thus the
manufacturing cell has generic services with minimal assumptions about what
kind of product will be assembled, while the digital product description is
designed collaboratively between the designer at an OEM and automated services
at potential manufacturers. This has several advantages. Firstly, the resulting
versatile manufacturing facility can handle a broad variety of products with
minimal or no reconfiguration effort, so it can cost-effectively offer its
services to a large number of OEMs. Secondly, a solution is presented to the
problem of performing concurrent product design and assembly planning over the
organizational boundary. Thirdly, the product design at the OEM is not
constrained to the capabilities of specific manufacturing facilities. The
concept is presented in general terms in UML and an implementation is provided
in a 3D simulation environment using Automation Markup Language for digital
product descriptions. Finally, two case studies are presented and applications
in a real industrial context are discussed.

  Relation to Slot Coating of Liquid Films","19 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Planar flow casting (PFC) is a method that can be used to make thin, long,
and wide metallic alloy foils by extruding molten liquid through a thin and
wide nozzle and immediately quenching on a moving roller. The quenching rates
are high enough that amorphous metallic glasses may be formed which have many
desirable properties for a wide variety of applications. This paper reviews how
PFC processes were developed, examines the typical operability range of PFC,
and reviews the defects that commonly form. The geometrical similarities
between PFC and slot coating process are apparent, and this paper highlights
differences between the operability ranges of both processes.

transfer in porous building materials. Several models have been proposed in the
literature to represent the amount of moisture content in the material
according to the water activity (or capillary pressure) level. These models are
based on analytical expressions and few parameters that need to be estimated by
inverse analysis. This article investigates the reliability of eight models
through the accuracy of the estimated parameters. For this, experimental data
for a wood fibre material are generated with special attention to the stop
criterion to capture long time kinetic constants. Among five sets of
measurements, the best estimate is computed. The reliability of the models is
then discussed. After proving the theoretical identifiability of the unknown
parameters for each model, the primary identifiability is analysed. It
evaluates whether the parameters influence on the model output is sufficient to
proceed the parameter estimation with accuracy. For this, a continuous
derivative-based approach is adopted. Seven models have a low primary
identifiability for at least one parameter. Indeed, when estimating the unknown
parameters using the experimental observations, the parameters with low primary
identifiability exhibit large uncertainties. Finally, an Approximation Bayesian
Computation algorithm is used to simultaneously select the best model and
estimate the parameters that best represent the experimental data. The
thermodynamic and \textsc{Feng}--\textsc{Xing} models, together with a proposed
model in this work, were the best ones selected by this algorithm.

storage density, but suffers from significant performance degradation due to a
large number of read-retry operations. Although the read-retry mechanism is
essential to ensuring the reliability of modern NAND flash memory, it can
significantly increase the read latency of an SSD by introducing multiple retry
steps that read the target page again with adjusted read-reference voltage
values. Through a detailed analysis of the read mechanism and rigorous
characterization of 160 real 3D NAND flash memory chips, we find new
opportunities to reduce the read-retry latency by exploiting two advanced
features widely adopted in modern NAND flash-based SSDs: 1) the CACHE READ
command and 2) strong ECC engine. First, we can reduce the read-retry latency
using the advanced CACHE READ command that allows a NAND flash chip to perform
consecutive reads in a pipelined manner. Second, there exists a large
ECC-capability margin in the final retry step that can be used for reducing the
chip-level read latency. Based on our new findings, we develop two new
techniques that effectively reduce the read-retry latency: 1) Pipelined
Read-Retry (PR$^2$) and 2) Adaptive Read-Retry (AR$^2$). PR$^2$ reduces the
latency of a read-retry operation by pipelining consecutive retry steps using
the CACHE READ command. AR$^2$ shortens the latency of each retry step by
dynamically reducing the chip-level read latency depending on the current
operating conditions that determine the ECC-capability margin. Our evaluation
using twelve real-world workloads shows that our proposal improves SSD response
time by up to 31.5% (17% on average) over a state-of-the-art baseline with only
small changes to the SSD controller.

advanced the state-of-the-art on many NLP tasks, they implicit semantics only
relying on surface information between words in corpus. Intuitively, background
knowledge influences the efficacy of understanding. Inspired by this common
sense, we focus on improving model pretraining by leveraging explicit
knowledge. Different from recent research that optimize pretraining model by
knowledge masking strategies, we propose a simple but general method to combine
explicit knowledge with pretraining. To be specific, we first match knowledge
facts from knowledge graph (KG) and then add a knowledge injunction layer to
transformer directly without changing its architecture. The present study seeks
to find the direct impact of explicit knowledge on transformer per-training. We
conduct experiments on various datasets for different downstream tasks. The
experimental results show that solely by adding external knowledge to
transformer can improve the learning performance on many NLP tasks.

experiences not just on the smart home front, but also in diverse educational
environments from classrooms to personalized-learning/tutoring. However, the
use of voice as an interaction modality also could result in exposure of user's
identity, and hinders the broader adoption of voice interfaces; this is
especially important in environments where children are present and their voice
privacy needs to be protected. To this end, building on state-of-the-art
techniques proposed in the literature, we design and evaluate a practical and
efficient framework for voice privacy at the source. The approach combines
speaker identification (SID) and speech conversion methods to randomly disguise
the identity of users right on the device that records the speech, while
ensuring that the transformed utterances of users can still be successfully
transcribed by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) solutions. We evaluate the
ASR performance of the conversion in terms of word error rate and show the
promise of this framework in preserving the content of the input speech.

shootings reported by media, more people in the U.S. think that police use
excessive force during law enforcement, especially to a specific group of
people. We want to apply multidimensional statistical analysis to reveal more
facts than the monotone mainstream media. Our paper has three parts. First, we
proposed a new method to quantify fatal police shooting news reporting
deviation of mainstream media, which includes CNN, FOX, ABC, and NBC. Second,
we analyzed the most comprehensive US fatal police shooting dataset from
Washington Post. We used FP-growth to reveal the frequent patterns and DBSCAN
clustering to find fatal shooting hotspots. We brought multi-attributes (social
economics, demographics, political tendency, education, gun ownership rate,
police training hours, etc.) to reveal connections under the iceberg. We found
that the police shooting rate of a state depends on many variables. The top
four most relevant attributes were state joined year, state land area, gun
ownership rate, and violent crime rate. Third, we proposed four regression
models to predict police shooting rates at the state level. The best model
Kstar could predict the fatal police shooting rate with about 88.53%
correlation coefficient. We also proposed classification models, including
Gradient Boosting Machine, Multi-class Classifier, Logistic Regression, and
Naive Bayes Classifier, to predict the race of fatal police shooting victims.
Our classification models show no significant evidence to conclude that racial
discrimination happened during fatal police shootings recorded by the WP
dataset.
