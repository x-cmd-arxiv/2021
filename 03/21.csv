  characterization, monotonicity, domination",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many commonly used test statistics are based on a norm measuring the evidence
against the null hypothesis. To understand how the choice of a norm affects
power properties of tests in high dimensions, we study the consistency sets of
$p$-norm based tests in the prototypical framework of sequence models with
unrestricted parameter spaces, the null hypothesis being that all observations
have zero mean. The consistency set of a test is here defined as the set of all
arrays of alternatives the test is consistent against as the dimension of the
parameter space diverges. We characterize the consistency sets of $p$-norm
based tests and find, in particular, that the consistency against an array of
alternatives cannot be determined solely in terms of the $p$-norm of the
alternative. Our characterization also reveals an unexpected monotonicity
result: namely that the consistency set is strictly increasing in $p \in (0,
\infty)$, such that tests based on higher $p$ strictly dominate those based on
lower $p$ in terms of consistency. This monotonicity allows us to construct
novel tests that dominate, with respect to their consistency behavior, all
$p$-norm based tests without sacrificing size.

having densities $f_i(\cdot;\theta)\equiv f_i(\cdot-\theta)\ ,\ i=1,2$ ,
$\theta\in\mathbb{R}$. His purpose is to conduct a test for
  \begin{equation*}
  H:\theta=0 \ \ \text{vs.}\ \ K:\theta\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}
  \end{equation*}
  with a pre-defined significance level $\alpha\in(0,1)$.
  Moran (1973) suggested a test which is based on a single split of the data,
\textit{i.e.,} to use $X_2$ in order to conduct a one-sided test in the
direction of $X_1$. Specifically, if $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the $(1-\alpha)$'th
and $\alpha$'th quantiles associated with the distribution of $X_2$ under $H$,
then Moran's test has a rejection zone
  \begin{equation*}
  (a,\infty)\times(b_1,\infty)\cup(-\infty,a)\times(-\infty,b_2)

  where $a\in\mathbb{R}$ is a design parameter.
  Motivated by this issue, the current work includes an analysis of a new
notion, \textit{regular admissibility} of tests. It turns out that the theory
regarding this kind of admissibility leads to a simple sufficient condition on
$f_1(\cdot)$ and $f_2(\cdot)$ under which Moran's test is inadmissible.
Furthermore, the same approach leads to a formal proof for the conjecture of
DiCiccio (2018) addressing that the multi-dimensional version of Moran's test
is inadmissible when the observations are $d$-dimensional Gaussians.

users at the same location share the same preference profile for a given set of
services. Specifically, by exploiting the location-aware users' preference
profiles, we propose joint optimization of the binary cache placement, the edge
computation resource and the bandwidth allocation to minimize the expected
sum-energy consumption, subject to the bandwidth and the computation
limitations as well as the service latency constraints. To effectively solve
the mixed-integer non-convex problem, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based
offline cache placement scheme using a novel stochastic quantization based
discrete-action generation method. The proposed hybrid learning framework
advocates both benefits from the model-free DL approach and the model-based
optimization. The simulations verify that the proposed DL-based scheme saves
roughly 33% and 6.69% of energy consumption compared with the greedy caching
and the popular caching, respectively, while achieving up to 99.01% of the
optimal performance.

role of collaborative decision making for air traffic scheduling and airspace

a lot of attempts to apply data-driven methods such as machine learning to
forecast flight delay situation using air traffic data of departures and

and temporal correlation between serial flights which results in inaccuracy
prediction. In this paper, we present a novel aviation delay prediction system
based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for commercial flights.
The system learns from historical trajectories from automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) messages and uses the correlative geolocations
to collect indispensable features such as climatic elements, air traffic,
airspace, and human factors data along posterior routes. These features are
integrated and then are fed into our proposed regression model. The latent
spatio-temporal patterns of data are abstracted and learned in the LSTM

be more robust and accurate for large hub airports.

considering an atom without permanent dipole moments, whose excitation energy
is quasi-resonant with the cavity photon energy, and by neglecting the non

representation of time-series data in the discrete space. Discretization
governs the information content of the resultant discretized sequence. On the

classification are more interpretable: their feature attributions tend to be
sharper, and are more concentrated on the objects associated with the image's
ground-truth class. We show that smooth decision boundaries play an important
role in this enhanced interpretability, as the model's input gradients around
data points will more closely align with boundaries' normal vectors when they
are smooth. Thus, because robust models have smoother boundaries, the results
of gradient-based attribution methods, like Integrated Gradients and DeepLift,
will capture more accurate information about nearby decision boundaries. This
understanding of robust interpretability leads to our second contribution:
\emph{boundary attributions}, which aggregate information about the normal
vectors of local decision boundaries to explain a classification outcome. We
show that by leveraging the key factors underpinning robust interpretability,
boundary attributions produce sharper, more concentrated visual explanations --

the time users spend with mundane tasks and improve the user experience.
Acoustic communication is gaining traction as a practical alternative to
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi because it can enable quick and localized information
transfer between consumer devices with built-in hardware. However, achieving
high data rates (>1 kbps) in such systems has been a challenge because the
systems and methods chosen for communication were not tailored to the
application. In this work, a high data rate, near-ultrasonic communication
(NUSC) system is proposed to transfer personal identification numbers (PINs) to
establish a connection between consumer laptops using built-in microphones and
speakers. The similarities between indoor near-ultrasonic and underwater
acoustic communication (UWAC) channels are identified, and appropriate UWAC
techniques are tailored to the NUSC system. The proposed system uses the
near-ultrasonic band at 18-20 kHz, and employs coherent modulation and
phase-coherent adaptive equalization. The capability of the proposed system is
explored in simulated and field experiments that span different device
orientations and distances. The experiments demonstrate data rates of 4 kbps
over distances of up to 5 meters, which is an order of magnitude higher than
the data rates reported with similar systems in the literature.

distribution of the reward-to-go, i.e. the return, providing more learning
signals that account for the uncertainty associated with policy performance,
which may be beneficial for trading off exploration and exploitation and policy
learning in general. Previous works in distributional RL focused mainly on
computing the state-action-return distributions, here we model the state-return
distributions. This enables us to translate successful conventional RL
algorithms that are based on state values into distributional RL. We formulate
the distributional Bellman operation as an inference-based auto-encoding
process that minimises Wasserstein metrics between target/model return
distributions. The proposed algorithm, BDPG (Bayesian Distributional Policy
Gradients), uses adversarial training in joint-contrastive learning to estimate
a variational posterior from the returns. Moreover, we can now interpret the
return prediction uncertainty as an information gain, which allows to obtain a
new curiosity measure that helps BDPG steer exploration actively and
efficiently. We demonstrate in a suite of Atari 2600 games and MuJoCo tasks,
including well known hard-exploration challenges, how BDPG learns generally
faster and with higher asymptotic performance than reference distributional RL
algorithms.

eliminating the chattering effects on the control signal.

construction for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The proposed
scheme is based on the concept of non-uniform channel polarization. The
original polar codes can only be designed with code lengths that are powers of
two. Puncturing, shortening and extension are three strategies to obtain
arbitrary code lengths and code rates for polar codes. There are other ways to
design codes with arbitrary length but which have encoding and decoding with
higher complexity such as multi-kernel, concatenated codes and specific
constructions for Belief propagation (BP) or Successive Cancellation (SC)
decoding. In general, the quality of the projected bit channels by these
arbitrary-length techniques differs from that of the original bit channels,
which can greatly affect the performance of the constructed polar codes. The
proposed Non-Uniform Polarization based on Gaussian Approximation (NUPGA) is an
efficient construction technique for rate-compatible arbitrary-length polar
codes, which chooses the best channels (i.e., selects the positions of the
information bits) by re-polarization of the codeword with desired length. A
generalization of the Gaussian Approximation is devised for both polarization
and re-polarization processes. We also present shortening and extension

applications for modern convenience, public safety, and homeland security. This
paper presents a factor graph formulation and a particle-based sum-product
algorithm (SPA) for scalable detection and tracking of extended objects. The
proposed method dynamically introduces states of newly detected objects,
efficiently performs probabilistic multiple-measurement to object association,
and jointly infers the geometric shapes of objects. Scalable extended object
tracking (EOT) is enabled by modeling association uncertainty by
measurement-oriented association variables and newly detected objects by a
Poisson birth process. Contrary to conventional EOT methods, a fully
particle-based approach makes it possible to describe different geometric
object shapes. The proposed method can reliably detect, localize, and track a
large number of closely-spaced extended objects without gating and clustering
of measurements. We demonstrate significant performance advantages of our
approach compared to the recently introduced Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture
filter. In particular, we consider a simulated scenarios with up to twenty
closely-spaced objects and a real autonomous driving application where
measurements are captured by a lidar sensor.

precise mobile robot path tracking in off-road terrain. In traditional tracking
error-based control approaches, feedback and feedforward controllers are
designed based on the nominal model which cannot capture the uncertainties,
disturbances and changing working conditions so that they cannot ensure precise
path tracking performance in the outdoor environment. In TELC algorithm, the
feedforward control actions are updated by using the tracking error dynamics
and the plant-model mismatch problem is thus discarded. Therefore, the
feedforward controller gradually eliminates the feedback controller from the
control of the system once the mobile robot has been on-track. In addition to
the proof of the stability, it is proven that the cost functions do not have
local minima so that the coefficients in TELC algorithm guarantee that the
global minimum is reached. The experimental results show that the TELC
algorithm results in better path tracking performance than the traditional
tracking error-based control method. The mobile robot controlled by TELC

edge nodes (ENs) connected via fronthaul links, have been regarded as promising
network architectures. The F-RAN entails a joint optimization of cloud and edge
computing as well as fronthaul interactions, which is challenging for
traditional optimization techniques. This paper proposes a Cloud-Enabled
Cooperation-Inspired Learning (CECIL) framework, a structural deep learning
mechanism for handling a generic F-RAN optimization problem. The proposed
solution mimics cloud-aided cooperative optimization policies by including
centralized computing at the cloud, distributed decision at the ENs, and their
uplink-downlink fronthaul interactions. A group of deep neural networks (DNNs)
are employed for characterizing computations of the cloud and ENs. The
forwardpass of the DNNs is carefully designed such that the impacts of the
practical fronthaul links, such as channel noise and signling overheads, can be
included in a training step. As a result, operations of the cloud and ENs can
be jointly trained in an end-to-end manner, whereas their real-time inferences
are carried out in a decentralized manner by means of the fronthaul
coordination. To facilitate fronthaul cooperation among multiple ENs, the
optimal fronthaul multiple access schemes are designed. Training algorithms
robust to practical fronthaul impairments are also presented. Numerical results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

predicted theoretically to exhibit a power-law scaling, but it is a significant

whether a power-law scaling of heat can exist for a first-order QPT. Here we
experimentally observe a power-law scaling of heat in a spinor condensate when

effective strategy updating rule, and voluntary participation is proposed by
introducing a third strategy in Prisoner's dilemma game. Some researches show
that combining Win-Stay-Lose-Learn rule with voluntary participation could
promote cooperation more significantly under moderate temptation values,
however, cooperators' survival under high aspiration levels and high temptation
values is still a challenging problem. In this paper, inspired by Achievement
Motivation Theory, a Dynamic-Win-Stay-Lose-Learn rule with voluntary
participation is investigated, where a dynamic aspiration process is introduced
to describe the co-evolution of individuals' strategies and aspirations. It is
found that cooperation is extremely promoted and defection is almost extinct in
our model, even when the initial aspiration levels and temptation values are
high. The combination of dynamic aspiration and voluntary participation plays
an active role since loners could survive under high initial aspiration levels
and they will expand stably because of their fixed payoffs. The robustness of
our model is also discussed and some adverse structures are found which should
be alerted in the evolutionary process. Our work provides a more realistic
model and shows that cooperators may prevail defectors in an unfavorable
initial environment.

strongly correlated with AALs, BALs, and radio loudness, indicating that a
significant fraction of high-velocity systems are either ejected from the
quasars or form in material swept up by the radio jets (and are not unrelated

indicator of high-velocity NALs formed in outflows. The fact that line-locked
NALs are highly ionized and correlated with BAL outflows and radio-loud quasars
implies that physical line locking due to radiative forces is both common and
real, which provides indirect evidence that a significant fraction of

to represent the system by model structure $S$ (a set of related mathematical

completely specified model in $S$. We use $S$ with system observations in
estimating the ""true"" (unknown) parameter vector. Inconveniently, multiple

render efforts in data collection and modelling fruitless. This outcome occurs
when $S$ lacks the property of structural global identifiability (SGI).
Fortunately, we can test various classes of structures for SGI prior to data
collection. A non-SGI result may guide changes to our structure or experimental

  Re-Identification","6 pages, accepted by ICME 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, video-based person re-identification (re-ID) has drawn increasing
attention in compute vision community because of its practical application
prospects. Due to the inaccurate person detections and pose changes, pedestrian
misalignment significantly increases the difficulty of feature extraction and
matching. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a
\textbf{R}eference-\textbf{A}ided \textbf{P}art-\textbf{A}ligned
(\textbf{RAPA}) framework to disentangle robust features of different parts.
Firstly, in order to obtain better references between different videos, a
pose-based reference feature learning module is introduced. Secondly, an
effective relation-based part feature disentangling module is explored to align
frames within each video. By means of using both modules, the informative parts
of pedestrian in videos are well aligned and more discriminative feature
representation is generated. Comprehensive experiments on three widely-used
benchmarks, i.e. iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011 and MARS datasets verify the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our code will be made publicly
available.

  Numerous natural language processing models have tried injecting commonsense

human biases such as ""lawyers are dishonest."" It is important that these biases
are not conflated with the notion of commonsense. We study this missing yet
important problem by first defining and quantifying biases in ConceptNet as two
types of representational harms: overgeneralization of polarized perceptions
and representation disparity. We find that ConceptNet contains severe biases
and disparities across four demographic categories. In addition, we analyze two
downstream models that use ConceptNet as a source for commonsense knowledge and
find the existence of biases in those models as well. We further propose a
filtered-based bias-mitigation approach and examine its effectiveness. We show
that our mitigation approach can reduce the issues in both resource and models

investigated the code quality impact on fault-proneness focusing on code smells

prediction based on SonarQube considering the contribution provided by each
rule and metric. Method. We designed and conducted a case study among 33 Java
projects analyzed with SonarQube and SZZ to identify fault-inducing and
fault-fixing commits. Moreover, we investigated fault-proneness of each
SonarQube rule and metric using Machine and Deep Learning models. Results. We
analyzed 77,932 commits that contain 40,890 faults and infected by more than
174 SonarQube rules violated 1,9M times, on which there was calculated 24
software metrics available by the tool. Compared to machine learning models,
deep learning provide a more accurate fault detection accuracy and allowed us
to accurately identify the fault-prediction power of each SonarQube rule. As a
result, fourteen of the 174 violated rules has an importance higher than 1\%
and account for 30\% of the total fault-proneness importance, while the fault
proneness of the remaining 165 rules is negligible. Conclusion. Future works
might consider the adoption of timeseries analysis and anomaly detection
techniques to better and more accurately detect the rules that impact
fault-proneness.

research and practice. Yet, throughout application domains, mathematical
optimization is, for the most part, considered to be a numerical discipline.
Optimization problems are formulated to be solved numerically with specific
algorithms running on microprocessors. An emerging alternative is to view
optimization algorithms as dynamical systems. While this new perspective is
insightful in itself, liberating optimization methods from specific numerical
and algorithmic aspects opens up new possibilities to endow complex real-world
systems with sophisticated self-optimizing behavior. Towards this goal, it is
necessary to understand how numerical optimization algorithms can be converted
into feedback controllers to enable robust ""closed-loop optimization"". In this
article, we review several research streams that have been pursued in this
direction, including extremum seeking and pertinent methods from model
predictive and process control. However, our focus lies on recent methods under
the name of ""feedback-based optimization"". This research stream studies control
designs that directly implement optimization algorithms in closed loop with
physical systems. Such ideas are finding widespread application in the design
and retrofit of control protocols for communication networks and electricity
grids. In addition to an overview over continuous-time dynamical systems for
optimization, our particular emphasis lies on closed-loop stability as well as
the enforcement of physical and operational constraints in closed-loop
implementations. We further illustrate these methods in the context of
classical problems, namely congestion control in communication networks and
optimal frequency control in electricity grids, and we highlight one potential
future application in the form of autonomous reserve dispatch in power systems.

the mean time for epidemic extinction is infinite. We also show that when the

independent of network structure. Simulations bear out these results, while
also demonstrating that if the per-person infectiousness is large when the

take a very long time for the epidemic to die out. We also provide some

for solving the fundamental finite-sum optimization problems. Concretely, we
consider both general convex and strongly convex settings: i) For general
convex finite-sum problems, ANITA improves previous state-of-the-art result
given by Varag (Lan et al., 2019). In particular, for large-scale problems or
the convergence error is not very small, i.e., $n \geq \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$,
ANITA obtains the \emph{first} optimal result $O(n)$, matching the lower bound
$\Omega(n)$ provided by Woodworth and Srebro (2016), while previous results are
$O(n \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ of Varag (Lan et al., 2019) and
$O(\frac{n}{\sqrt{\epsilon}})$ of Katyusha (Allen-Zhu, 2017). ii) For strongly
convex finite-sum problems, we also show that ANITA can achieve the optimal
convergence rate $O\big((n+\sqrt{\frac{nL}{\mu}})\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big)$
matching the lower bound
$\Omega\big((n+\sqrt{\frac{nL}{\mu}})\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big)$ provided by
Lan and Zhou (2015). Besides, ANITA enjoys a simpler loopless algorithmic
structure unlike previous accelerated algorithms such as Varag (Lan et al.,

Moreover, we provide a novel \emph{dynamic multi-stage convergence analysis},
which is the key technical part for improving previous results to the optimal
rates. We believe that our new theoretical rates and novel convergence analysis
for the fundamental finite-sum problem will directly lead to key improvements
for many other related problems, such as distributed/federated/decentralized
optimization problems (e.g., Li and Richt\'arik, 2021). Finally, the numerical
experiments show that ANITA converges faster than the previous state-of-the-art
Varag (Lan et al., 2019), validating our theoretical results and confirming the
practical superiority of ANITA.

surfaces, and considers effects of turbulence length scales and fuel
characteristics. The present model predicts the turbulent burning velocity via
an algebraic expression without free parameters. It is validated against 285
cases of the direct numerical simulation or experiment reported from various
research groups on planar and Bunsen flames over a wide range of conditions,
covering fuels from hydrogen to n-dodecane, pressures from 1 to 20 atm, lean
and rich mixtures, turbulence intensity ratios from 0.35 to 110, and turbulence
length ratios from 0.5 to 80. The comprehensive comparison shows that the
proposed turbulent burning velocity model has an overall good agreement over
the wide range of conditions, with the averaged modeling error of 25.3%.
Furthermore, the model prediction involves the uncertainty quantification for
model parameters and chemical kinetics to extend the model applicability.

sprawl. The term urban sprawl refers to overgrowth and expansion of low-density
areas with issues such as car dependency and segregation between residential
versus commercial use. Sprawl has impacts on the environment and public health.
In our work, spatiotemporal features related to real GIS data on urban sprawl
such as population growth and demographics are mined to discover knowledge for
decision support. We adapt data mining algorithms, Apriori for association rule
mining and J4.8 for decision tree classification to geospatial analysis,
deploying the ArcGIS tool for mapping. Knowledge discovered by mining this
spatiotemporal data is used to implement a prototype spatial decision support
system (SDSS). This SDSS predicts whether urban sprawl is likely to occur.
Further, it estimates the values of pertinent variables to understand how the
variables impact each other. The SDSS can help decision-makers identify
problems and create solutions for avoiding future sprawl occurrence and
conducting urban planning where sprawl already occurs, thus aiding sustainable
development. This work falls in the broad realm of geospatial intelligence and
sets the stage for designing a large scale SDSS to process big data in complex
environments, which constitutes part of our future work.

zero-intelligence trader intended for use in simulation studies of the dynamics
of continuous double auction markets. Like Gode & Sunder's classic ZIC trader,
PRZI generates quote-prices from a random distribution over some specified
domain of allowable quote-prices. Unlike ZIC, which uses a uniform distribution
to generate prices, the probability distribution in a PRZI trader is
parameterised in such a way that its probability mass function (PMF) is
determined by a real-valued control variable s in the range [-1.0, +1.0] that
determines the _strategy_ for that trader. When s=0, a PRZI trader is identical
to ZIC, with a uniform PMF; but when |s|=~1 the PRZI trader's PMF becomes
maximally skewed to one extreme or the other of the price-range, thereby making
its quote-prices more or less urgent, biasing the quote-price distribution
toward or away from the trader's limit-price. To explore the co-evolutionary
dynamics of populations of PRZI traders that dynamically adapt their
strategies, I show results from long-term market experiments in which each
trader uses a simple stochastic hill-climber algorithm to repeatedly evaluate
alternative s-values and choose the most profitable at any given time. In these
experiments the profitability of any particular s-value may be non-stationary
because the profitability of one trader's strategy at any one time can depend
on the mix of strategies being played by the other traders at that time, which
are each themselves continuously adapting. Results from these market
experiments demonstrate that the population of traders' strategies can exhibit
rich dynamics, with periods of stability lasting over hundreds of thousands of
trader interactions interspersed by occasional periods of change. Python

autonomous driving, however common performance measures may be too general or
too specific. For binary classifiers, diagnostic tests or prognosis at a
timepoint, measures such as the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve, or the area under the precision recall curve, are too
general because they include unrealistic decision thresholds. On the other
hand, measures such as accuracy, sensitivity or the F1 score are measures at a
single threshold that reflect an individual single probability or predicted
risk, rather than a range of individuals or risk. We propose a method in
between, deep ROC analysis, that examines groups of probabilities or predicted
risks for more insightful analysis. We translate esoteric measures into
familiar terms: AUC and the normalized concordant partial AUC are balanced
average accuracy (a new finding); the normalized partial AUC is average
sensitivity; and the normalized horizontal partial AUC is average specificity.
Along with post-test measures, we provide a method that can improve model
selection in some cases and provide interpretation and assurance for patients
in each risk group. We demonstrate deep ROC analysis in two case studies and
provide a toolkit in Python.

explained based on the Mulliken population analysis and charge density mapping
(CDM). The electronic properties have been dealt with by considering electronic
band structure and density of states (DOS) which confirmed the metallic nature
of Zr2AB2 (A = In, Tl). The lowly dispersive energy bands along the c-direction
confirmed anisotropy in conductivity. The analysis of DOS revealed the dominant
contribution from Zr-d orbitals to the conductivity with a small contribution
from the In/Tl-p states contributing at the Fermi level. The Debye temperature
(Theta-D), minimum thermal conductivity (Kmin), Gruneisen parameter and melting
temperature (Tm) have been calculated. The higher values of Theta-D and Tm, and
lower value of Kmin for Zr2AB2 (A = In, Tl) compared to those of Zr2AC (A = In,
Tl). Besides, the specific heat capacities, thermal expansion coefficient, and
different thermodynamic potential functions have been calculated. The optical
constants have been studied to reveal their possible relevance for application
purposes. The reflectivity spectra revealed the applicability of Zr2AB2 (A =

ensuring data confidentiality using lightweight encryption algorithms for IoT

Encryption-BMC and Fuzzing (EBF), which combines Bounded Model Checking (BMC)

concurrent implementations of cyrptographic protocols, which include data race,
thread leak, arithmetic overflow, and memory safety. EBF models IoT protocols

First, we use the concurrency benchmark from SV-COMP and show that it
outperforms other state-of-the-art tools such as ESBMC, AFL, Lazy-CSeq, and

the WolfSSL library. We show that \tool detects a data race bug, which other

replicate some known vulnerabilities in OpenSSL and CyaSSL (lately WolfSSL)

state-of-the-arts in a wide range of NLP tasks. However, the performance of
BERT-based models is mainly driven by the enormous amount of parameters, which
hinders their application to resource-limited scenarios. Faced with this
problem, recent studies have been attempting to compress BERT into a
small-scale model. However, most previous work primarily focuses on a single
kind of compression technique, and few attention has been paid to the
combination of different methods. When BERT is compressed with integrated
techniques, a critical question is how to design the entire compression
framework to obtain the optimal performance. In response to this question, we
integrate three kinds of compression methods (weight pruning, low-rank
factorization and knowledge distillation (KD)) and explore a range of designs
concerning model architecture, KD strategy, pruning frequency and learning rate
schedule. We find that a careful choice of the designs is crucial to the
performance of the compressed model. Based on the empirical findings, our best
compressed model, dubbed Refined BERT cOmpreSsion with InTegrAted techniques
(ROSITA), is $7.5 \times$ smaller than BERT while maintains $98.5\%$ of the
performance on five tasks of the GLUE benchmark, outperforming the previous
BERT compression methods with similar parameter budget. The code is available

elastic properties of open-cell poroelastic media based on sound absorption
measurements. The sought properties are the Biot-Johnson-Champoux-Allard model
parameters, namely five transport parameters, two elastic properties and the
mass density, as well as the sample thickness. The methodology relies on a
multi-observation approach, consisting in combining multiple independent
measurements into a single dataset, with the aim of over-determining the
problem. In the present work, a poroelastic sample is placed in an impedance
tube and tested in two loading conditions, namely in a rigid-backing
configuration and coupled to a resonant expansion chamber. Given the
non-monotonic nature of the experimental data, an incremental parameter
estimation procedure is used in order to guide the model parameters towards the
global solution without terminating at local minima. A statistical inversion
approach is also discussed, providing refined point estimates, uncertainty
ranges and parameter correlations. The methodology is applied to the
characterisation of a sample of melamine foam and provides estimates of all
nine parameters with compact uncertainty ranges. It is shown that the model
parameters are retrieved with a lower uncertainty in the multi-observation
case, as compared with a single-observation case. The method proposed here does
not require prior knowledge of the thickness or any of the properties of the
sample, and can be carried out with a standard two-microphone impedance tube.

equations and b) Legendre-Fenchel transform of the scaled cumulant generating
function obtained via a cloning algorithm. The rate function presents
asymptotically linear branches on both sides and it is independent of the
system's dimensionality, apart from a multiplicative factor. For the confining
potential case, we focus on two-dimensional systems and obtain the rate
function numerically using both methods a) and b). We find a different scenario
for harmonic and anharmonic potentials: in the former case, the phenomenology
of fluctuations is analogous to that of a free particle, but the rate function
might be non-analytic; in the latter case the rate functions are analytic, but
fluctuations are realised by entirely different means, which rely strongly on
the particle-potential interaction. Finally, we check the validity of a
fluctuation relation for the active work distribution. In the free-particle
case, the relation is satisfied with a slope proportional to the bath
temperature. The same slope is found for the harmonic potential, regardless of

slightly different viewing angles), by occlusions (when they hide differently

require a repulsive reference such as a hard-core one when applied to systems
with short-range repulsion. The need for the reference is circumvented here by
using a functional renormalization group approach for integrating the
hierarchical flow of correlation functions along a path of variable interatomic
coupling. We introduce the cavity distribution functions to avoid the
appearance of divergent terms and choose a path to reduce the error caused by
the decomposition of higher order correlation functions. We demonstrate using
an exactly solvable one-dimensional models that the resulting scheme yields
accurate thermodynamic properties and interatomic distribution at various
densities when compared to integral-equation methods such as the hypernetted
chain and the Percus-Yevick equation, even in the case where our hierarchical
equations are truncated with the Kirkwood superposition approximation, which is
valid for low-density cases.

software quality concern has emerged -- energy consumption. However, developing
energy-efficient software and applications requires knowledge and likewise
proper tooling to support mobile developers. To this aim, we present an
approach to examine the energy evolution of software revisions based on their
API interactions. The approach stems from the assumption that the utilization
of an API has direct implications on the energy being consumed during runtime.
Based on an empirical evaluation, we show initial results that API interactions
serve as a flexible, lightweight, and effective way to compare software
revisions regarding their energy evolution. Given our initial results we
envision that in future using our approach mobile developers will be able to
gain insights on the energy implications of changes in source code in the

these approaches learn a model based on a pixel-level or global-level feature

Moreover, such works can only measure the relations between them on a single

simultaneously be well classified via three distinct level similarity metrics,
the query images within a class can be more tightly distributed in a smaller

we propose a novel Part-level Embedding Adaptation with Graph (PEAG) method to

locate uncertain areas of images and have various scales, which leads to the

this paper, we investigate unresolved questions, without accepted answers, on
Stack Overflow. The number of unresolved questions is increasing. As of August
2019, 47% of Stack Overflow questions were unresolved. In this study, we
analyze the effectiveness of various features, including some novel features,
to resolve a question. We do not use the features that contain information not
present at the time of asking a question, such as answers. To evaluate our
features, we deploy several predictive models trained on the features of 18
million questions to predict whether a question will get an accepted answer or
not. The results of this study show a significant relationship between our
proposed features and getting accepted answers. Finally, we introduce an online
tool that predicts whether a question will get an accepted answer or not.
Currently, Stack Overflow's users do not receive any feedback on their
questions before asking them, so they could carelessly ask unclear, unreadable,
or inappropriately tagged questions. By using this tool, they can modify their
questions and tags to check the different results of the tool and deliberately
improve their questions to get accepted answers.

forms a double Boolean algebra (dBa) which is fully contextual. Semiconcepts of
a context form a pure dBa. The present article is a study on topological
representation results for dBas, and in particular, those for fully contextual
and pure dBas. In this work, a context on topological spaces (CTS) is
considered, and the focus is on a special kind of CTS in which the relation
defining the context as well as the converse of the relation are continuous
with respect to the topologies. Such CTS are denoted as CTSCR. It is observed
that clopen object oriented protoconcepts of a CTSCR form a fully contextual
dBa, while clopen object oriented semiconcepts form a pure dBa. Every dBa is
shown to be quasi-embeddable into the dBa of clopen object oriented
protoconcepts of a particular CTSCR. The quasi-embedding turns into an
embedding in case of a contextual dBa, and into an isomorphism, when the dBa is
fully contextual. For pure dBas, one obtains an isomorphism with the algebra of
clopen object oriented semiconcepts of the CTSCR. Representation of finite dBas
and Boolean algebras are also addressed in the process. Abstraction of
properties of this CTSCR leads to the definition of Stone contexts. Stone
contexts and CTSCR- homeomorphisms are seen to form a category, denoted Scxt.
Furthermore, correspondences are observed between dBa isomorphisms and
CTSCR-homeomorphisms. This motivates a study of categorical duality of dBas,
constituting the second part of the article. Pure dBas and fully contextual
dBas along with dBa isomorphisms form categories, denoted PDBA and FCDBA
respectively. It is established that PDBA is equivalent to FCDBA, while FCDBA
and PDBA are dually equivalent to Scxt.

and foot kinematics during walking using only two or three wearable inertial
sensors. Methods: The algorithm makes novel use of a Lie-group-based extended
Kalman filter. The algorithm iterates through the prediction (kinematic
equation), measurement (pelvis position pseudo-measurements, zero-velocity
update, and flat-floor assumption), and constraint update (hinged knee and
ankle joints, constant leg lengths). Results: The inertial motion capture
algorithm was extensively evaluated on two datasets showing its performance
against two standard benchmark approaches in optical motion capture (i.e.,
plug-in gait (commonly used in gait analysis) and a kinematic fit (commonly
used in animation, robotics, and musculoskeleton simulation)), giving insight
into the similarity and differences between the said approaches used in
different application areas. The overall mean body segment position (relative
to mid-pelvis origin) and orientation error magnitude of our algorithm ($n=14$
participants) for free walking was $5.93 \pm 1.33$ cm and $13.43 \pm
1.89^\circ$ when using three IMUs placed on the feet and pelvis, and $6.35 \pm
1.20$ cm and $12.71 \pm 1.60^\circ$ when using only two IMUs placed on the
feet. Conclusion: The algorithm was able to track the joint angles in the
sagittal plane for straight walking well, but requires improvement for
unscripted movements (e.g., turning around, side steps), especially for dynamic
movements or when considering clinical applications. Significance: This work
has brought us closer to comprehensive remote gait monitoring using IMUs on the

cornerstones of modern software development, and allows for these parts to

  A major challenge of such independent deployment, however, is to ensure that
despite their individual evolution, the interfaces between interacting parts
remain compatible. This is especially important for enterprise software
systems, which are often highly integrated and based on heterogenous IT
infrastructures.
  Although several approaches for interface evolution have been proposed, many
of these rely on the developer to adhere to certain rules, but provide little

topics in the domain of computer vision. Recently, the study on this topic in
aerial images has made tremendous progress. However, complex background and
worse imaging quality are obvious problems in aerial object detection. Most
state-of-the-art approaches tend to develop elaborate attention mechanisms for
the space-time feature calibrations with arduous computational complexity,
while surprisingly ignoring the importance of feature calibrations in
channel-wise. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
Calibrated-Guidance (CG) scheme to enhance channel communications in a feature
transformer fashion, which can adaptively determine the calibration weights for
each channel based on the global feature affinity correlations. Specifically,
for a given set of feature maps, CG first computes the feature similarity
between each channel and the remaining channels as the intermediary calibration
guidance. Then, re-representing each channel by aggregating all the channels
weighted together via the guidance operation. Our CG is a general module that
can be plugged into any deep neural networks, which is named as CG-Net. To
demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency, extensive experiments are carried
out on both oriented object detection task and horizontal object detection task
in aerial images. Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks (DOTA and

glass transition remains a highly debated problem, where the crux of the puzzle
resides in the elusive increase of the activation barrier $\Delta E(T)$ with
decreasing temperature $T$. A class of theoretical frameworks -- known as
elastic models -- attribute this temperature dependence to the variations of
the liquid's macroscopic elasticity, quantified by the high-frequency shear
modulus $G_\infty(T)$. While elastic models find some support in a number of
experimental studies, these models do not take into account the spatial
structures, length scales, and heterogeneity associated with structural
relaxation in supercooled liquids. Here, we propose that viscous slowing down
is controlled by a mesoscopic elastic stiffness $\kappa(T)$, defined as the
characteristic stiffness of response fields to local dipole forces in the
liquid's underlying inherent states. First, we show that $\kappa(T)$ -- which
is intimately related to the energy and length scales characterizing
quasilocalized, nonphononic excitations in glasses -- increases more strongly
with decreasing $T$ than the macroscopic inherent state shear modulus $G(T)$ in
several computer liquids. Second, we show that the simple relation $\Delta
E(T)\propto\kappa(T)$ holds remarkably well for some computer liquids, implying
a direct connection between the liquid's underlying mesoscopic elasticity and
enthalpic energy barriers. On the other hand, we show that for other computer
liquids, the above relation fails. Finally, we provide strong evidence that
what distinguishes computer liquids in which the $\Delta E(T) \propto
\kappa(T)$ relation holds, from those in which it does not, is that the latter
feature highly granular potential energy landscapes, where many sub-basins
separated by low activation barriers exist. [Rest of abstract abridged]

surrounding fluid, like dark matter, with conserved energy-momentum tensor,
have a deviation $\alpha$ and primary hair $l_0$, apart from rotation parameter
$a$ and mass $M$. In the wake of the \textit{Event Horizon Telescope}
(\textit{EHT}) observations of the supermassive black hole M87*, a recent surge
in interest in black hole shadows suggests comparing the black holes in general
relativity (GR) and modified theories of gravity (MoG) to assess these models'
differences. Motivated by this, we take on an extensive study of the rotating
hairy Kerr black holes, which encompasses, in particular cases, the Kerr black
hole ($\alpha=0$). We investigate ergosphere and shadows of the black holes to
infer that their size and shape are affected due to the $l_0$ and are found to
harbour a richer chaotic structure. In particular, the hairy Kerr black holes
possess smaller size but more distorted shadows when compared with Kerr black
holes. We also estimate the parameters $l_0$ and $a$ associated with hairy Kerr
black holes using the shadow observables. The inferred circularity deviation
$\Delta C \leq 0.1$ for the M87* black hole is satisfied, whereas shadow
angular diameter $\theta_{d}=42 \pm 3 \mu as$, within $1 \sigma$ region, for a
given choice of $\alpha$, places bounds on the parameters $a$ and $l_0$.
Interestingly, the shadow axial ratio obeying $1< D_x \lesssim 4/3$ is in
agreement with the \textit{EHT} results and thus eventuates in the hairy Kerr
black holes being suitable candidates for astrophysical black holes.

the problem, we propose a novel deep incomplete clustering method, named Deep
Distribution-preserving Incomplete Clustering with Optimal Transport (DDIC-OT).
To avoid insufficient sample utilization in existing methods limited by few
fully-observed samples, we propose to measure distribution distance with the
optimal transport for reconstruction evaluation instead of traditional
pixel-wise loss function. Moreover, the clustering loss of the latent feature
is introduced to regularize the embedding with more discrimination capability.
As a consequence, the network becomes more robust against missing features and
the unified framework which combines clustering and sample imputation enables
the two procedures to negotiate to better serve for each other. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed network achieves superior and stable
clustering performance improvement against existing state-of-the-art incomplete
clustering methods over different missing ratios.

COVID-19 patients cough and breath in a different way than the healthy people.
Several research groups have created mobile and web-platform for crowdsourcing

for exploration as well as to understand the perception of the red planet.
Before launching a mission, the space probe undergoes critical ground testing
and effective preparation. Though probes were carefully tested and validated,
many experiences temporary or permanent setbacks prior to their final state of
mission accomplishment, resulting in the failure of the mission. In order to
figure out the problems concerning probe malfunction or failure, we conducted a
study on failed Mars probes that are launched between 1960 to 2020. The probes
were characterized to determine various modes of failure and their impact on
the missions. The results of our study from past probes showed effective
integration and testing, sterling fabrication and validation of space probes,
adequate software design, feasible recovery options, and novel guidance to
probe computers and communication systems.

  bbab365","10.1093/bib/bbab365",,"q-bio.BM cs.LG q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the consolidation of deep learning in drug discovery, several novel
algorithms for learning molecular representations have been proposed. Despite
the interest of the community in developing new methods for learning molecular
embeddings and their theoretical benefits, comparing molecular embeddings with
each other and with traditional representations is not straightforward, which
in turn hinders the process of choosing a suitable representation for QSAR
modeling. A reason behind this issue is the difficulty of conducting a fair and
thorough comparison of the different existing embedding approaches, which
requires numerous experiments on various datasets and training scenarios. To
close this gap, we reviewed the literature on methods for molecular embeddings
and reproduced three unsupervised and two supervised molecular embedding
techniques recently proposed in the literature. We compared these five methods
concerning their performance in QSAR scenarios using different classification
and regression datasets. We also compared these representations to traditional
molecular representations, namely molecular descriptors and fingerprints. As
opposed to the expected outcome, our experimental setup consisting of over
25,000 trained models and statistical tests revealed that the predictive
performance using molecular embeddings did not significantly surpass that of
traditional representations. While supervised embeddings yielded competitive
results compared to those using traditional molecular representations,
unsupervised embeddings tended to perform worse than traditional
representations. Our results highlight the need for conducting a careful
comparison and analysis of the different embedding techniques prior to using
them in drug design tasks, and motivate a discussion about the potential of
molecular embeddings in computer-aided drug design.

  Document-Level Structural Information","To be published in AAAI2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we focus on the problem of unsupervised image-sentence
matching. Existing research explores to utilize document-level structural
information to sample positive and negative instances for model training.
Although the approach achieves positive results, it introduces a sampling bias
and fails to distinguish instances with high semantic similarity. To alleviate
the bias, we propose a new sampling strategy to select additional
intra-document image-sentence pairs as positive or negative samples.
Furthermore, to recognize the complex pattern in intra-document samples, we
propose a Transformer based model to capture fine-grained features and
implicitly construct a graph for each document, where concepts in a document
are introduced to bridge the representation learning of images and sentences in
the context of a document. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our
approach to alleviate the bias and learn well-aligned multimodal
representations.

Commissioner's Office (ICO) have been working together to discover ways to
tackle the difficult issues surrounding explainable AI. The ultimate product of
this joint endeavour, Explaining decisions made with AI, published in May 2020,
is the most comprehensive practical guidance on AI explanation produced
anywhere to date. We have put together this workbook to help support the uptake
of that guidance. The goal of the workbook is to summarise some of main themes
from Explaining decisions made with AI and then to provide the materials for a
workshop exercise that has been built around a use case created to help you
gain a flavour of how to put the guidance into practice. In the first three
sections, we run through the basics of Explaining decisions made with AI. We
provide a precis of the four principles of AI explainability, the typology of
AI explanations, and the tasks involved in the explanation-aware design,
development, and use of AI/ML systems. We then provide some reflection
questions, which are intended to be a launching pad for group discussion, and a
starting point for the case-study-based exercise that we have included as
Appendix B. In Appendix A, we go into more detailed suggestions about how to
organise the workshop. These recommendations are based on two workshops we had
the privilege of co-hosting with our colleagues from the ICO and Manchester
Metropolitan University in January 2021. The participants of these workshops
came from both the private and public sectors, and we are extremely grateful to
them for their energy, enthusiasm, and tremendous insight. This workbook would
simply not exist without the commitment and keenness of all our collaborators
and workshop participants.

  Learning Approaches",,,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  A novel framework of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-enhanced
indoor wireless networks is proposed, where an RIS mounted on the robot is
invoked to enable mobility of the RIS and enhance the service quality for
mobile users. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques are
adopted to further increase the spectrum efficiency since RISs are capable to
provide NOMA with artificial controlled channel conditions, which can be seen
as a beneficial operation condition to obtain NOMA gains. To optimize the sum
rate of all users, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is
invoked to optimize the deployment and phase shifts of the mobile RIS as well
as the power allocation policy. In order to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of agent training for the DDPG agents, a federated learning (FL)
concept is adopted to enable multiple agents to simultaneously explore similar
environments and exchange experiences. We also proved that with the same random
exploring policy, the FL armed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents can
theoretically obtain a reward gain compare to the independent agents. Our
simulation results indicate that the mobile RIS scheme can significantly
outperform the fixed RIS paradigm, which provides about three times data rate
gain compare to the fixed RIS paradigm. Moreover, the NOMA scheme is capable to
achieve a gain of 42% in contrast with the OMA scheme in terms of sum rate.
Finally, the multi-cell simulation proved that the FL enhanced DDPG algorithm
has a superior convergence rate and optimization performance than the
independent training framework.
