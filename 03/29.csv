large fields of view and are readily scalable to any size, all other things

calibration and performance of the AARTFAAC-12 instrument, which is composed of
the twelve centrally located stations of the LOFAR array. We go into the

There are existing studies on different types of incremental program analysis.
However, none of them focuses on Call Graph generation for an entire ecosystem.

difficult to identify and understand. Determining the root cause for these
errors can improve future decisions. This work presents Generative Error Model
(GEM), a generative model for inferring representational errors based on
observations of an actor's behavior (either simulated agent, robot, or human).
The model considers two sources of error: those that occur due to
representational limitations -- ""blind spots"" -- and non-representational
errors, such as those caused by noise in execution or systematic errors present
in the actor's policy. Disambiguating these two error types allows for targeted
refinement of the actor's policy (i.e., representational errors require
perceptual augmentation, while other errors can be reduced through methods such
as improved training or attention support). We present a Bayesian inference
algorithm for GEM and evaluate its utility in recovering representational
errors on multiple domains. Results show that our approach can recover blind
spots of both reinforcement learning agents as well as human users.

in the version control system of a software. In contrast, extrinsic bugs are
caused by external changes to a software, such as errors in external APIs;
thereby they do not have an explicit bug introducing change in the version
control system. Although most previous research literature has assumed that all
bugs are of intrinsic nature, in a previous study, we show that not all bugs
are intrinsic. This paper shows an example of how considering extrinsic bugs
can affect software engineering research. Specifically, we study the impact of
extrinsic bugs in Just In Time bug prediction by partially replicating a recent
study by McIntosh and Kamei on JIT models. These models are trained using
properties of earlier bug-introducing changes. Since extrinsic bugs do not have
bug introducing changes in the version control system, we manually curate
McIntosh and Kamei's dataset to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic
bugs. Then, we address their original research questions, this time removing
extrinsic bugs, to study whether bug-introducing changes are a moving target in
Just-In-Time bug prediction. Finally, we study whether characteristics of
intrinsic and extrinsic bugs are different. Our results show that intrinsic and
extrinsic bugs are of different nature. When removing extrinsic bugs the
performance is different up to 16 % Area Under the Curve points. This indicates
that our JIT models obtain a more accurate representation of the real world. We
conclude that extrinsic bugs negatively impact Just-In-Time models.
Furthermore, we offer evidence that extrinsic bugs should be further
investigated, as they can significantly impact how software engineers

order-$(K-1)$ messages for the $K$-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
broadcast channel with delayed channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT) and arbitrary antenna configurations, where the transmitter has $M$
antennas and the receiver $i=1,2,\cdots,K$ has $N_i$ antennas. For the
converse, we first derive the DoF region of order-$(K-1)$ messages for the
$K$-user MIMO broadcast channel with no CSIT and arbitrary antenna
configurations with the aid of the proposed Genie-bound, and then establish the
DoF outer region. For the achievability, we first design a 2-phase transmission
scheme, and then propose a backward/forward cancellation algorithm for
decoding. Specifically, we efficiently derive the achievable DoF region from
the designed transmission scheme by transformation approach. The main
implication of this paper is that for the order-$(K-1)$ messages of $K$-user
MIMO broadcast channel, the DoF region with delayed CSIT is larger than the DoF
region with no CSIT when $N_2<M$, where $N_1 \le N_2 \le \cdots \le N_K$.

workers face depending on their sector of activity, their age, sex, location
and educational level. In particular, we show that differences in
cross-sectional market power are significant and higher than variations over
the ten-year time span of our data. In contrast to findings of labour market
power in developed countries such as the US, we document significant market
power of employers in Peru vis-\`a-vis the tertiary educated workforce,
regardless of age and sector. In contrast, for the primary educated workforce,
market power seems to be high in (private) services and manufacturing. For
secondary educated workers, only the mining sector stands out as moderately
more monopsonistic than the rest of the labour market. We also show that at
least for the 2010s, labour market power declined in Peru. We contrast these
findings with similar estimates obtained for the United States where we are
able to show that increases in labour market power are particularly acute in
certain sectors, such as agriculture and entertainment and recreational
services, as well as in specific geographic areas where these sectors are
dominant. Moreover, we show that for the US, the labour market power has
gradually increased over the past ten years, in line with the general rise in
inequality. Importantly, we show that the pervasive gender pay gap cannot be
linked to differential market power as men face higher labour market power than
women. We also discuss possible reasons for these findings, including for the
differences of labour market power across skill levels. Especially, we discuss
the reasons for polarization of market power that are specific to sectors and

superconductivity as well as superfluidity is classified into two phases;
confined and deconfined phases of vortices. We establish that the criterion of
the confinement is color neutrality of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases: vortices
exhibiting color non-singlet AB phases are confined by the so-called AB defects
to form color-singlet bound states. In the deconfined phase, the most stable
vortices are non-Abelian Alice strings, which are superfluid vortices with
fractional circulation and non-Abelian color magnetic fluxes therein,
exhibiting color non-singlet AB phases. On the other hand, in the confined
phase, these non-Abelian vortices are confined to either a baryonic or mesonic
bound state in which constituent vortices are connected by AB defects. The
baryonic bound state consists of three non-Abelian Alice strings with different
color magnetic fluxes with the total flux canceled out connected by a domain
wall junction, while the mesonic bound state consists of two non-Abelian Alice
strings with the same color magnetic fluxes connected by a single domain wall.
Interestingly, the latter contains a color magnetic flux in its core, but this
can exist because of color neutrality of its AB phase.

Gaussian process and neural tangent kernel. To represent the temporal kernel,
we introduce the random feature approach and convert the kernel learning
problem to spectral density estimation under reparameterization. We further

locally bijective graph homomorphisms, for {\em graphs with semi-edges}. The
notion of graph covering is a discretization of coverings between surfaces or
topological spaces, a notion well known and deeply studied in classical
topology. Graph covers have found applications in discrete mathematics for
constructing highly symmetric graphs, and in computer science in the theory of
local computations. In 1991, Abello et al. asked for a classification of the
computational complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target
graph, in the ordinary setting (of graphs with only edges). Although many
general results are known, the full classification is still open. In spite of
that, we propose to study the more general case of covering graphs composed of
normal edges (including multiedges and loops) and so-called semi-edges.
Semi-edges are becoming increasingly popular in modern topological graph
theory, as well as in mathematical physics. They also naturally occur in the
local computation setting, since they are lifted to matchings in the covering
graph. We show that the presence of semi-edges makes the covering problem
considerably harder; e.g., it is no longer sufficient to specify the vertex
mapping induced by the covering, but one necessarily has to deal with the edge
mapping as well. We show some solvable cases, and completely characterize the
complexity of the already very nontrivial problem of covering one- and
two-vertex (multi)graphs with semi-edges. Our NP-hardness results are proven
for simple input graphs, and in the case of regular two-vertex target graphs,
even for bipartite ones. This provides a strengthening of previously known
results for covering graphs without semi-edges, and may contribute to better
understanding of this notion and its complexity.

However, Ingenuity's simplified approach was limited to flat terrains. The
current paper introduces a novel range measurement update model based on using
facet constraints. The resulting range-VIO approach is no longer limited to
flat scenes, but extends to any arbitrary structure for generic robotic
applications. An important theoretical result shows that scale is no longer in
the right nullspace of the observability matrix for zero or constant
acceleration motion. In practical terms, this means that scale becomes
observable under constant-velocity motion, which enables simple and robust
autonomous operations over arbitrary terrain. Due to the small range finder
footprint, range-VIO retains the minimal size, weight, and power attributes of
VIO, with similar runtime. The benefits are evaluated on real flight data

  Operating Rooms Over a Wasserstein Ambiguity",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study elective surgery planning in flexible operating rooms (ORs) where
emergency patients are accommodated in the existing elective surgery schedule.
Specifically, elective surgeries can be scheduled weeks or months in advance.
In contrast, an emergency surgery arrives randomly and must be performed on the
day of arrival. Probability distributions of the actual durations of elective
and emergency surgeries are unknown, and only a possibly small set of
historical realizations may be available. To address distributional
uncertainty, we first construct an ambiguity set that encompasses all possible
distributions of surgery durations within a 1-Wasserstein distance from the
empirical distribution. We then define a distributionally robust surgery
assignment (DSA) problem to determine optimal elective surgery assignment
decisions to available surgical blocks in multiple ORs, considering the
capacity needed for emergency cases. The objective is to minimize the total
cost consisting of the fixed cost related to scheduling or rejecting elective
surgery plus the maximum expected cost associated with OR overtime and idle
time over all distributions defined in the ambiguity set. Using the DSA model's
structural properties, we derive an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) reformulation that can be implemented and solved efficiently using
off-the-shelf optimization software. In addition, we extend the proposed model
to determine the number of ORs needed to serve the two competing surgery
classes and derive a MILP reformulation of this extension. We conduct extensive
numerical experiments based on real-world surgery data, demonstrating our
proposed model's computational efficiency and superior out-of-sample
operational performance over two state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we
derive insights into surgery scheduling in flexible ORs.

reconstruct the original wideband spectrum with under-sampled measurements
become inefficient as local spectral correlation is deliberately omitted.
Recent works extend communication methods with deep learning-based algorithms
but lack strong ties to THz channel properties. This paper introduces novel THz
channel-aware spectrum learning solutions that fully disclose the uniqueness of
THz channels when performing such ultra-broadband sensing in vehicular
environments. Specifically, a joint design of spectrum compression and
reconstruction is proposed through a structured sensing matrix and two-phase
reconstruction based on high spreading loss and molecular absorption at THz
frequencies. An end-to-end learning framework, namely compression and
reconstruction network (CRNet), is further developed with the mean-square-error
loss function to improve sensing accuracy while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Numerical results show that the CRNet solutions
outperform the latest generative adversarial network (GAN) realization with a
much higher cosine and structure similarity measures, smaller learning errors,

intrinsic non-stationarity of these systems. For what concerns point 1. we
propose a L0-norm sparse elliptical modeling and show that sparsification is

found that portfolio performances deteriorate and detach from the models'

this phenomenon by studying the out-of-sample likelihood of individual

estimation windows lead to stable likelihood in the long run, but at the cost
of lower likelihood in the short-term: the `optimal' fit in finance needs to be

problem for the video encoder -- trained for action classification, but used
for TAL. Intuitively, end-to-end model optimization is a good solution.
However, this is not operable for TAL subject to the GPU memory constraints,
due to the prohibitive computational cost in processing long untrimmed videos.
In this paper, we resolve this challenge by introducing a novel low-fidelity
end-to-end (LoFi) video encoder pre-training method. Instead of always using
the full training configurations for TAL learning, we propose to reduce the
mini-batch composition in terms of temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal
resolution so that end-to-end optimization for the video encoder becomes
operable under the memory conditions of a mid-range hardware budget. Crucially,
this enables the gradient to flow backward through the video encoder from a TAL
loss supervision, favourably solving the task discrepancy problem and providing
more effective feature representations. Extensive experiments show that the
proposed LoFi pre-training approach can significantly enhance the performance
of existing TAL methods. Encouragingly, even with a lightweight ResNet18 based
video encoder in a single RGB stream, our method surpasses two-stream ResNet50

records in computer vision. While drawing attention worldwide, the design of
the overall structure lacks general guidance. Based on the relationship between
DNN design and numerical differential equations, we performed a fair comparison
of the residual design with higher-order perspectives. We show that the widely
used DNN design strategy, constantly stacking a small design (usually 2-3
layers), could be easily improved, supported by solid theoretical knowledge and
with no extra parameters needed. We reorganise the residual design in
higher-order ways, which is inspired by the observation that many effective
networks can be interpreted as different numerical discretisations of
differential equations. The design of ResNet follows a relatively simple
scheme, which is Euler forward; however, the situation becomes complicated
rapidly while stacking. We suppose that stacked ResNet is somehow equalled to a
higher-order scheme; then, the current method of forwarding propagation might
be relatively weak compared with a typical high-order method such as
Runge-Kutta. We propose HO-ResNet to verify the hypothesis of widely used CV
benchmarks with sufficient experiments. Stable and noticeable increases in
performance are observed, and convergence and robustness are also improved. Our
stacking strategy improved ResNet-30 by 2.15 per cent and ResNet-58 by 2.35 per

is fundamental and theoretical and can therefore be applied to any network as a

graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p,d,q)$, where each of the $n$ vertices corresponds to an
independent random point distributed uniformly on the sphere
$\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, and the probability that two vertices are connected by an
edge is a decreasing function of the Euclidean distance between the points. The
probability of connection is parametrized by $q \in [0,1]$, with smaller $q$
corresponding to weaker dependence on the geometry; this can also be
interpreted as the level of noise in the geometric graph. In particular, the
model smoothly interpolates between the spherical hard random geometric graph
$\mathcal{G}(n,p,d)$ (corresponding to $q = 1$) and the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model
$\mathcal{G}(n,p)$ (corresponding to $q = 0$). We focus on the dense regime
(i.e., $p$ is a constant).
  We show that if $nq \to 0$ or $d \gg n^{3} q^{2}$, then geometry is lost:
$\mathcal{G}(n,p,d,q)$ is asymptotically indistinguishable from
$\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. On the other hand, if $d \ll n^{3} q^{6}$, then the signed
triangle statistic provides an asymptotically powerful test for detecting
geometry. These results generalize those of Bubeck, Ding, Eldan, and R\'acz
(2016) for $\mathcal{G}(n,p,d)$, and give quantitative bounds on how the noise
level affects the dimension threshold for losing geometry. We also prove
analogous results under a related but different distributional assumption, and

compactons consist of pointwise distributional solutions as well as weak

previously. An explicit example is obtained in which the compacton profile is a
power of an expression that is linear in the travelling wave variable and its

voxel-wise variable is a 3x3 positive definite matrix other than a scalar,
describing the diffusion process at the voxel. Recently, several statistical
methods have been proposed to analyze the DTI data. This paper focuses on the
statistical inference of eigenvalues of DTI because it provides more
transparent clinical interpretations. However, the statistical inference of
eigenvalues is statistically challenging because few treat these responses as
random eigenvalues. In our paper, we rely on the distribution of the Wishart
matrix's eigenvalues to model the random eigenvalues. A hierarchical model
which captures the eigenvalues' randomness and spatial auto-correlation is
proposed to infer the local covariate effects. The Monte-Carlo
Expectation-Maximization algorithm is implemented for parameter estimation.
Both simulation studies and application to IXI data-set are used to demonstrate
our proposal. The results show that our proposal is more proper in analyzing
auto-correlated random eigenvalues compared to alternatives.

and accelerate inference, making it possible to be deployed on mobile and edge
devices. To retain the high performance of full-precision models, most existing
quantization methods focus on fine-tuning quantized model by assuming training
datasets are accessible. However, this assumption sometimes is not satisfied in
real situations due to data privacy and security issues, thereby making these
quantization methods not applicable. To achieve zero-short model quantization
without accessing training data, a tiny number of quantization methods adopt
either post-training quantization or batch normalization statistics-guided data
generation for fine-tuning. However, both of them inevitably suffer from low
performance, since the former is a little too empirical and lacks training
support for ultra-low precision quantization, while the latter could not fully
restore the peculiarities of original data and is often low efficient for
diverse data generation. To address the above issues, we propose a zero-shot
adversarial quantization (ZAQ) framework, facilitating effective discrepancy
estimation and knowledge transfer from a full-precision model to its quantized
model. This is achieved by a novel two-level discrepancy modeling to drive a
generator to synthesize informative and diverse data examples to optimize the
quantized model in an adversarial learning fashion. We conduct extensive
experiments on three fundamental vision tasks, demonstrating the superiority of
ZAQ over the strong zero-shot baselines and validating the effectiveness of its
main components. Code is available at <https://git.io/Jqc0y>.

work, cascades are polychrony groups in which the number of nodes activated as
a consequence of other nodes is greater than the number of externally activated
nodes. The difference between these two numbers is the so-called profit.
  Given the initial conditions, we predict the conditions for a vertex to
activate at a prescribed time and provide an algorithm to efficiently
reconstruct a cascade. We develop a dictionary between polychrony groups and
graph theory. We call the graph corresponding to a cascade a chinampa. This
link leads to a topological classification of chinampas. We enumerate the

isomorphic to a family of partially ordered sets, which implies that the

challenging to constrain observationally. In this work, we discuss a novel
approach to probe chemical inhomogeneities within long Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)
host galaxies, by comparing the absorption metallicity, Z_abs, from the GRB
afterglow (which probes the environment along the line of sight) with the
emission-line metallicity, Z_emiss, measured via slit spectroscopy. Using the
IllustrisTNG simulation, the theoretical relationship between these metallicity
metrics is explored for a range of GRB formation models, varying the GRB
progenitor metallicity threshold. For galaxies with fixed Z_emiss, the median
value of Z_abs depends strongly on the GRB progenitor threshold metallicity,
with Z_abs significantly lower than Z_emiss for high metallicity hosts.
Conversely, at fixed Z_abs, the median value of Z_emiss depends primarily on
the metallicity distribution of galaxies in IllustrisTNG and their chemical
inhomogeneities, offering a GRB-model-independent way to constrain these
processes observationally. Currently, only one host galaxy has data for both
absorption and emission metallicities (GRB121014A). We re-analyse the emission
spectrum and compare the inferred metallicity Z_emiss to a recent Bayesian
determination of Z_abs, finding $\log(Z_{\rm emiss}/Z_{\odot}) = \log(Z_{\rm
abs}/Z_{\odot}) +0.35^{+ 0.14}_{- 0.25}$, within ~2 standard deviations of
predictions from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Future observations with the
James Webb Space Telescope will be able to measure Z_emiss for 4 other GRB
hosts with known Z_abs values, using ~2 hour observations. While small, the
sample will provide preliminary constraints on the Z_abs-Z_emiss relation to
test chemical enrichment schemes in cosmological simulations.

condensates of metastable Helium atoms released from a harmonic trap. The
far-field density profile exhibits features that support identification of the
tails of the momentum distribution as originating in the in-situ quantum
depletion prior to release. Thus, we corroborate recent observations of
slowly-decaying tails in the far-field beyond the thermal component. This
observation is in conflict with the hydrodynamic theory, which predicts that
the in-situ depletion does not survive when atoms are released from a trap.
Indeed, the depleted tails even appear stronger in the far-field than expected
before release, and we discuss the challenges of interpreting this in terms of
the Tan contact in the trapped gas. In complement to these observations, full
quantum simulations of the experiment show that, under the right conditions,
the depletion can persist into the far field after expansion. Moreover, the
simulations provide mechanisms for survival and for the the large-momentum
tails to appear stronger after expansion due to an acceleration of the depleted
atoms by the mean-field potential. However, while in qualitative agreement, the

elements and emit radioactively powered radiation, called kilonova. Although
r-process nucleosynthesis was confirmed by the observations of
GW170817/AT2017gfo, no trace of individual elements has been identified except
for strontium. In this paper, we perform systematic calculations of line
strength for bound-bound transitions and radiative transfer simulations in NS
merger ejecta toward element identification in kilonova spectra. We find that
Sr II triplet lines appear in the spectrum of a lanthanide-poor model, which is
consistent with the absorption feature observed in GW170817/AT2017gfo. The
synthetic spectrum also shows the strong Ca II triplet lines. This is natural
because Ca and Sr are co-produced in the material with relatively high electron
fraction and their ions have similar atomic structures with only one s-electron
in the outermost shell. The line strength, however, highly depends on the
abundance distribution and temperature in the ejecta. For our lanthanide-rich
model, the spectra show the features of doubly ionized heavy elements, such as
Ce, Tb and Th. Our results suggest that the line forming region of
GW170817/AT2017gfo was lanthanide-poor. We show that the Sr II and Ca II lines
can be used as a probe of physical conditions in NS merger ejecta. Absence of
the Ca II line features in GW170817/AT2017gfo implies that the Ca/Sr ratio is <
0.002 in mass fraction, which is consistent with nucleosynthesis for electron
fraction >= 0.40 and entropy per nucleon (in units of Boltzmann constant) >=

prone to faults, because faults in a few nodes cause the entire system to fail.
Consequently, fault tolerance of distributed systems is a critical issue.
Checkpoint-rollback recovery is a universal and representative technique for
fault tolerance; it periodically records the entire system state
(configuration) to non-volatile storage, and the system restores itself using
the recorded configuration when the system fails. To record a configuration of
a distributed system, a specific algorithm known as a snapshot algorithm is
required. However, many snapshot algorithms require coordination among all
nodes in the system; thus, frequent executions of snapshot algorithms require
unacceptable communication cost, especially if the systems are large. As a
sophisticated snapshot algorithm, a partial snapshot algorithm has been
introduced that takes a partial snapshot (instead of a global snapshot).
However, if two or more partial snapshot algorithms are concurrently executed,
and their snapshot domains overlap, they should coordinate, so that the partial
snapshots (taken by the algorithms) are consistent. In this paper, we propose a
new efficient partial snapshot algorithm with the aim of reducing communication
for the coordination. In a simulation, we show that the proposed algorithm
drastically outperforms the existing partial snapshot algorithm, in terms of
message and time complexity.

concurrent algorithms from specifications. Our approach avoids restrictive
atomicity contraints. It provides a range of constructs for specifying
concurrent programs and laws for refining these to code. We augment pre and
post condition specifications with Jones' rely and guarantee conditions, which
we encode as commands within a wide-spectrum language. Program components are
specified using either partial and total correctness versions of end-to-end
specifications. Operations on shared data structures and atomic machine
operations (e.g. compare-and-swap) are specified using an atomic specification
command. All the above constructs are defined in terms of a simple core
language, based on four primitive commands and a handful of operators, and for
which we have developed an extensive algebraic theory in Isabelle/HOL. For
shared memory programs, expression evaluation is subject to fine-grained
interference and we have avoided atomicity restrictions other than for read and
write of primitive types (words). Expression evaluation and assignment commands
are also defined in terms of our core language primitives, allowing laws for
reasoning about them to be proven in the theory. Control structures such as
conditionals, recursion and loops are all defined in terms of the core
language. In developing the laws for refining to such structures from

possible; our laws are typically more general than those found in the
literature. In developing our concurrent refinement theory we have taken care
to focus on the algebraic properties of our commands and operators, which has
allowed us to reuse algebraic theories, including well-known theories, such as

attention. It is known that channel selection is an important problem of ad-hoc

recognition yet, particularly with a large-scale ad-hoc microphone array. To
address this problem, we propose a Scaling Sparsemax algorithm for the channel
selection problem of the speech recognition with large-scale ad-hoc microphone
arrays. Specifically, we first replace the conventional Softmax operator in the
stream attention mechanism of a multichannel end-to-end speech recognition
system with Sparsemax, which conducts channel selection by forcing the channel
weights of noisy channels to zero. Because Sparsemax punishes the weights of
many channels to zero harshly, we propose Scaling Sparsemax which punishes the
channels mildly by setting the weights of very noisy channels to zero only.
Experimental results with ad-hoc microphone arrays of over 30 channels under
the conformer speech recognition architecture show that the proposed Scaling
Sparsemax yields a word error rate of over 30% lower than Softmax on simulation
data sets, and over 20% lower on semi-real data sets, in test scenarios with
both matched and mismatched channel numbers.

captured by a camera is on the camera or not. Based on the behavioral research,
the focus of an individual during face-to-camera communication leads to a
special type of eye contact, i.e., the individual-camera eye contact, which is
a powerful signal in social communication and plays a crucial role in
recognizing irregular individual status (e.g., lying or suffering mental
disease) and special purposes (e.g., seeking help or attracting fans). Thus,
developing effective onfocus detection algorithms is of significance for
assisting the criminal investigation, disease discovery, and social behavior
analysis. However, the review of the literature shows that very few efforts
have been made toward the development of onfocus detector due to the lack of
large-scale public available datasets as well as the challenging nature of this
task. To this end, this paper engages in the onfocus detection research by
addressing the above two issues. Firstly, we build a large-scale onfocus
detection dataset, named as the OnFocus Detection In the Wild (OFDIW). It
consists of 20,623 images in unconstrained capture conditions (thus called ``in
the wild'') and contains individuals with diverse emotions, ages, facial
characteristics, and rich interactions with surrounding objects and background
scenes. On top of that, we propose a novel end-to-end deep model, i.e., the
eye-context interaction inferring network (ECIIN), for onfocus detection, which
explores eye-context interaction via dynamic capsule routing. Finally,
comprehensive experiments are conducted on the proposed OFDIW dataset to
benchmark the existing learning models and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed ECIIN. The project (containing both datasets and codes) is at

consequently become a wide-open backdoor in those networks, due to both the
adversarial vulnerability of deep learning and GPS-based vehicle trajectory
estimation that is susceptible to wireless spoofing? We demonstrate such
possibilities for the first time: instead of directly attacking point cloud
coordinates which requires tampering with the raw LiDAR readings, only
adversarial spoofing of a self-driving car's trajectory with small
perturbations is enough to make safety-critical objects undetectable or
detected with incorrect positions. Moreover, polynomial trajectory perturbation
is developed to achieve a temporally-smooth and highly-imperceptible attack.
Extensive experiments on 3D object detection have shown that such attacks not

also transfer to other detectors, raising a red flag for the community. The

to build novel intermetallics with alternative stacking of two parent
compounds. Here we formalize the idea by defining a class of bulk crystalline
solids with $A$-$B$ stacking (including 1144-phases and beyond), which is a
generalization of hetero-structures from few-layer or thin-film semi-conductors
to bulk intermetallics. Theoretically, four families of phosphides
\textit{AB}(TM)$_4$P$_4$ (TM=Fe, Ru, Co, Ni) are investigated by
first-principles calculations, wherein configurational, vibrational and
electronic degrees of freedom are considered. It predicts a variety of stable
1144-phases (especially Ru- and Fe-phosphides). Stability rules are found and
structural/electronic properties are discussed. Experimentally, we synthesize
high-purity CaKRu$_4$P$_4$ as a proof of principle example. The synthetic
method is simple and easily applied. Moreover, it alludes to a strategy to
explore complex multi-component compounds, facilitated by a phase diagram
coordinated by collective descriptors.

Networks(DNN). It greatly affects generalization performance but the underlying
mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent works show that for layers followed
by normalizations, weight decay mainly affects the effective learning rate.
However, despite normalizations have been extensively adopted in modern DNNs,
layers such as the final fully-connected layer do not satisfy this
precondition. For these layers, the effects of weight decay are still unclear.
In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the mechanisms of weight decay
and find that except for influencing effective learning rate, weight decay has
another distinct mechanism that is equally important: affecting generalization
performance by controlling cross-boundary risk. These two mechanisms together
give a more comprehensive explanation for the effects of weight decay. Based on
this discovery, we propose a new training method called FixNorm, which discards
weight decay and directly controls the two mechanisms. We also propose a simple
yet effective method to tune hyperparameters of FixNorm, which can find
near-optimal solutions in a few trials. On ImageNet classification task,
training EfficientNet-B0 with FixNorm achieves 77.7%, which outperforms the
original baseline by a clear margin. Surprisingly, when scaling MobileNetV2 to
the same FLOPS and applying the same tricks with EfficientNet-B0, training with
FixNorm achieves 77.4%, which is only 0.3% lower. A series of SOTA results show
the importance of well-tuned training procedures, and further verify the
effectiveness of our approach. We set up more well-tuned baselines using
FixNorm, to facilitate fair comparisons in the community.

Degree-of-Freedoms (DOFs) that is much less than the rank of the network

feature rank, so that features corresponding to the dominant motions are
retained while others are rejected. Last, we propose a Feature Identity Loss
(FIL) to enforce the learned image feature warp-equivariant, meaning that the
result should be identical if the order of warp operation and feature
extraction is swapped. With this constraint, the unsupervised optimization is
achieved more effectively and more stable features are learned. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of all the newly

Unfortunately, these strategies may not exercise uncommon usage patterns of a

adversarial specification mining, and develop a prototype, DICE (Diversity

After mining Linear Temporal Logic specifications from an input test suite,
DICE-Tester adversarially guides test generation, searching for counterexamples
to these specifications to invalidate spurious properties. These
counterexamples represent gaps in the diversity of the input test suite. This
process produces execution traces of usage patterns that were unrepresented in

DICE-Miner, to infer FSAs using the traces, guided by the temporal

we use the FSAs in a fuzzer for servers of stateful protocols, increasing its

pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we show that it is possible to delete and clone a
class of two different and nonorthogonal states, and it can be generalized to
arbitrary two different and nonorthogonal pure qubit states. Furthermore, state
discrimination, which is strongly related to quantum no-cloning theorem, is
also discussed. Last but not least, we simulate the pseudo-unitary operators in
conventional quantum mechanics with post-selection, and obtain the success
probability of simulations. Pseudo-unitary operators are implemented with a
limited efficiency due to the post-selections. Thus, the success probabilities

sensors may be spatially distributed and be connected to a self-triggering
mechanism through finite data-rate channels. Each sensor independently encodes
its measurements and sends them to the self-triggering mechanism. The
self-triggering mechanism integrates quantized measurement data and then
computes sampling times. Assuming that the closed-loop system is stable in the
absence of quantization and self-triggered sampling, we propose a joint design
method of an encoding scheme and a self-triggering mechanism for stabilization.
To deal with data inaccuracy due to quantization, the proposed self-triggering
mechanism uses not only quantized data but also an upper bound of quantization
errors, which is shared with a decoder.

those low-probability, yet extreme events. To address such occurrences, this
paper proposes an infinite-horizon risk-constrained Linear Quadratic Regulator
(LQR) framework with time-average cost. In addition to the standard LQR
objective, the average one-stage predictive variance of the state penalty is
constrained to lie within a user-specified level. By leveraging the duality,
its optimal solution is first shown to be stationary and affine in the state,
i.e., $u(x,\lambda^*) = -K(\lambda^*)x + l(\lambda^*)$, where $\lambda^*$ is an
optimal multiplier, used to address the risk constraint. Then, we establish the
stability of the resulting closed-loop system. Furthermore, we propose a
primal-dual method with sublinear convergence rate to find an optimal policy
$u(x,\lambda^*)$. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework and the primal-dual method.

the noise in distantly labeled data, we further propose a framework that
iteratively estimates the probabilistic relation labels and eliminates the
noisy ones. Comprehensive experimental results show that our distantly

system throughput. Then, the JRM problem is decoupled into two iterative
subtasks: subcarrier assignment (SA, including user grouping) and power
allocation (PA). Each subtask is a sequential decision process. Invoking a deep
deterministic policy gradient algorithm, our proposed DRL-based JRM (DRL-JRM)
approach jointly performs the two subtasks, where the optimization objective
and constraints of the subtasks are addressed by a new joint reward and
internal reward mechanism. A multi-agent structure and a convolutional neural
network are adopted to reduce the complexity of the PA subtask. We also tailor
the neural network structure for the stability and convergence of DRL-JRM.
Corroborated by extensive experiments, the proposed DRL-JRM scheme is superior
to existing alternatives in terms of system throughput and resistance to
interference, especially in the presence of many users and strong inter-cell
interference. DRL-JRM can flexibly meet individual service requirements of
users.

more examples in the input or feature space and between the corresponding
target labels. Many recent mixup methods focus on cutting and pasting two or
more objects into one image, which is more about efficient processing than
interpolation. However, how to best interpolate images is not well defined. In
this sense, mixup has been connected to autoencoders, because often
autoencoders ""interpolate well"", for instance generating an image that
continuously deforms into another.
  In this work, we revisit mixup from the interpolation perspective and
introduce AlignMix, where we geometrically align two images in the feature
space. The correspondences allow us to interpolate between two sets of
features, while keeping the locations of one set. Interestingly, this gives
rise to a situation where mixup retains mostly the geometry or pose of one
image and the texture of the other, connecting it to style transfer. More than
that, we show that an autoencoder can still improve representation learning
under mixup, without the classifier ever seeing decoded images. AlignMix
outperforms state-of-the-art mixup methods on five different benchmarks.

band structure features, including layer- and sublattice-resolved proximity
spin-orbit or exchange couplings. For different relative twist angles (0 or
60$^{\circ}$) of the WS$_2$ layers, and the magnetizations (parallel or
antiparallel) of the CGT layers, with respect to BLG, the low energy bands are
found and characterized by a series of fit parameters of model Hamiltonians.
These effective models are then employed to investigate the tunability of the
relevant energy dispersions by a gate field. For WS$_2$/BLG/WS$_2$
encapsulation we find that twisting allows to turn off the spin splittings away
from the $K$ points, due to opposite proximity-induced valley-Zeeman couplings
in the two sheets of BLG. Close to the $K$ points the electron spins are
polarized out of the plane. This polarization can be flipped by applying a gate
field. As for magnetic CGT/BLG/CGT structures, we realize the recently proposed
spin-valve effect, whereby a gap opens for antiparallel magnetizations of the
CGT layers. Furthermore, we find that for the antiferromagnetic orientation the
electron states away from $K$ have vanishingly weak proximity exchange, while
the states close to $K$ remain spin polarized in the presence of an electric
field. The induced magnetization can be flipped by changing the gate field.
These findings should be useful for spin transport, spin filtering, and spin
relaxation anisotropy studies of BLG-based vdW heterostructures.

  Softening Output Distributions",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose Selective Output Smoothing Regularization, a novel
regularization method for training the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Inspired by the diverse effects on training from different samples, Selective
Output Smoothing Regularization improves the performance by encouraging the
model to produce equal logits on incorrect classes when dealing with samples
that the model classifies correctly and over-confidently. This plug-and-play
regularization method can be conveniently incorporated into almost any
CNN-based project without extra hassle. Extensive experiments have shown that
Selective Output Smoothing Regularization consistently achieves significant
improvement in image classification benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Tiny
ImageNet, ImageNet, and CUB-200-2011. Particularly, our method obtains 77.30%
accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, which gains 1.1% than baseline (76.2%). We
also empirically demonstrate the ability of our method to make further
improvements when combining with other widely used regularization techniques.
On Pascal detection, using the SOSR-trained ImageNet classifier as the
pretrained model leads to better detection performances.

  Generalization in Adversarial Training",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent improvements in deep learning models and their practical applications
have raised concerns about the robustness of these models against adversarial
examples. Adversarial training (AT) has been shown effective to reach a robust
model against the attack that is used during training. However, it usually
fails against other attacks, i.e. the model overfits to the training attack
scheme. In this paper, we propose a simple modification to the AT that
mitigates the mentioned issue. More specifically, we minimize the perturbation
$\ell_p$ norm while maximizing the classification loss in the Lagrangian form.
We argue that crafting adversarial examples based on this scheme results in
enhanced attack generalization in the learned model. We compare our final model
robust accuracy against attacks that were not used during training to closely
related state-of-the-art AT methods. This comparison demonstrates that our
average robust accuracy against unseen attacks is 5.9% higher in the CIFAR-10
dataset and is 3.2% higher in the ImageNet-100 dataset than corresponding
state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate that our attack is faster than
other attack schemes that are designed for unseen attack generalization, and
conclude that it is feasible for large-scale datasets.

the simplicity of NN-Descent are well-preserved. In addition, a simple but

the infimum of a model elastic energy per unit volume scales like the fourth

chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process at 1000{\deg}C. During MOCVD, the
Cu-Ni alloy grains acted as a template for the growth of hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) while decaborane and ammonia were used as precursors for boron
and nitrogen, respectively. Boron and nitrogen atoms diffused into the Cu-Ni
solution during the MOCVD process, precipitated out and grew along the Cu-Ni
interfaces upon cooling. It was demonstrated that pores were generated during
the sintering process and then filled by bulk hBN during the MOCVD process
(indicated by energy dispersive spectroscopy) as the pores also served as
catalytic sites for the nucleation and growth of hBN. Optical microscopy
examination indicated that there was a minimum amount of bulk hBN at certain
compaction pressure (280 MPa) and sintering time (30 min). Scanning electron
microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the
interconnected network of hBN layers surrounding the Cu-Ni grains was developed
in the 3Di-hBN-Cu-Ni composite. This 3Di-hBN network is expected to enhance the

universe, responsible for the universe's accelerated expansion. Therefore, it

exact star solution consisting of an ordinary matter and phantom field from a
constant density star (CDS) known as Schwarzschild interior solution. The star
denotes a dark energy star (DES). The author claims that the phantom field
represents dark energy within the star. So far, the role of the phantom field
as dark energy in DES is not systematically studied yet. Related to this issue,
we analyze the energy condition of DES. We expect that DES shall violate the
strong energy condition (SEC) for a particular condition. We discover that SEC
is fully violated only when the compactness reaches the Buchdahl limit.
Furthermore, we also investigate the causal conditions and stabilities due to
the convective motion and gravitational cracking. We also find that those
conditions are violated. These results indicate that DES is not physically
stable. However, we may consider DES as an ultra-compact object of which we can
calculate the gravitational wave echo time and echo frequency and compare them
to those of CDS. We find that the contribution of the phantom field delays the
gravitational wave echoes. The effective potential of the perturbed DES is also
studied. The potential also enjoys a potential well like CDS but with a deeper
well. We also investigate the possibility that DES could form a gravastar when
$ C=1 $. It is found that gravastar produced from DES possesses no singularity
with a dS-like phase as the interior. These results could open more
opportunities for the observational study of dark energy in the near future,
mostly from the compact astrophysical objects.

the directional test to overperform its competitors even in these cases. The

we inferred the family structure. Backward orbital integration of selected
members allowed us to determine the age of the family. The largest fragment
(525) Adelaide, an S-type asteroid about $10$ km in size, is accompanied by 50
sub-kilometre fragments. This family is a typical example of a cratering event.
The very tiny extent in the semi-major axis minimises chances that some
significant mean motion resonances influence the dynamics of its members,
though we recognise that part of the Adelaide family is affected by weak,
three-body resonances. Weak chaos is also produced by distant encounters with
Mars. Simultaneous convergence of longitude of node for the orbits of six
selected members to that of (525) Adelaide constrains the Adelaide family age
to $536\pm 12$ kyr (formal solution). While suspiciously overlapping with the
age of the Datura family, we find it unlikely that the formation events of the

Based on conventional episodic training on support-query pairs, we add an
additional mining branch that exploits latent novel classes via transferable

our transferable sub-cluster has the ability to leverage extra unlabeled data

estimation will decrease NVS performance as view synthesis highly depends on
the quality of estimated scene geometry. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end NVS framework to eliminate the error propagation issue. To be
specific, we construct a volume under the target view and design a source-view
visibility estimation (SVE) module to determine the visibility of the
target-view voxels in each source view. Next, we aggregate the visibility of
all source views to achieve a consensus volume. Each voxel in the consensus
volume indicates a surface existence probability. Then, we present a soft
ray-casting (SRC) mechanism to find the most front surface in the target view
(i.e. depth). Specifically, our SRC traverses the consensus volume along
viewing rays and then estimates a depth probability distribution. We then warp
and aggregate source view pixels to synthesize a novel view based on the
estimated source-view visibility and target-view depth. At last, our network is
trained in an end-to-end self-supervised fashion, thus significantly
alleviating error accumulation in view synthesis. Experimental results

general relativity context as well as in a quantum theoretical framework. Two
features are found to deserve special attention: the first is the possibility
of separating the limit-point condition at infinity into loxodromic,
hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic cases. This is useful in a context in which
one wants to look for a correspondence between essentially self-adjoint
spherically symmetric Hamiltonians of quantum physics and the theory of
Bondi-Metzner-Sachs transformations in general relativity. The analogy
therefore arising, suggests that further investigations might be performed for
a theory in which the role of fractional linear maps is viewed as a bridge
between the quantum theory and general relativity. The second aspect to point
out is the possibility of interpreting the limit-point condition at both ends
of the positive real line, for a second-order singular differential operator,
which occurs frequently in applied quantum mechanics, as the limiting procedure
arising from a very particular Kleinian group which is the hyperbolic cyclic
group. In this framework, this work finds that a consistent system of equations
can be derived and studied. Hence one is led to consider the entire
transcendental functions, from which it is possible to construct a fundamental
system of solutions of a second-order differential equation with singular
behavior at both ends of the positive real line, which in turn satisfy the
limit-point conditions.

gravitationally lensed occasionally. The detection of lensed images with
millisecond-to-second time delays provides evidence for intermediate-mass black
holes, a population that has been difficult to observe. Several studies have
searched for these delays in gamma-ray burst light curves, which would indicate
an intervening gravitational lens. Among the $\sim 10^4$ gamma-ray bursts
observed, there have been a handful of claimed lensing detections, but none
have been statistically robust. Here we present a Bayesian analysis identifying
gravitational lensing in the light curve of GRB950830. The inferred lens mass
depends on the unknown lens redshift $z_l$, and is given by $(1+z_l)M_l =
5.5^{+1.7}_{-0.9}\times 10^4 $ M$_\odot$ (90% credibility), which we interpret
as evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole. The most probable
configuration, with a lens redshift $z_l\sim 1$ and a gamma-ray burst redshift
$z_s\sim 2$, yields a present day number density of $n_\text{imbh}\approx
2.3^{+4.9}_{-1.6}\times10^{3} \text{ Mpc}^{-3}$ (90% credibility) with a
dimensionless energy density $\Omega_\text{imbh} \approx
4.6^{+9.8}_{-3.3}\times10^{-4}$. The false alarm probability for this detection
is $\sim0.6\%$ with trial factors. While it is possible that GRB950830 was
lensed by a globular cluster, it is unlikely since we infer a cosmic density
inconsistent with predictions for globular clusters $\Omega_\text{gc} \approx 8
\times 10^{-6}$ at 99.8% credibility. If a significant intermediate-mass black
hole population exists, it could provide the seeds for the growth of
supermassive black holes in the early Universe.

works, the transients we are interested in occur on a time-scale where
dispersion starts to play a role, so we must search a higher-dimensional data
space and yet work fast enough to keep up with the data stream in real time.
The approach consists of five main steps: quality control, source detection,
association, flux measurement, and physical parameter inference. We present
parallelized methods based on convolutions and filters that can be accelerated
on a GPU, allowing the pipeline to run in real-time. In the parameter inference
step, we apply a convolutional neural network to dynamic spectra that were
obtained from the preceding steps. It infers physical parameters, among which
the dispersion measure of the transient candidate. Based on critical values of
these parameters, an alert can be sent out and data will be saved for further
investigation. Experimentally, the pipeline is applied to simulated data and
images from AARTFAAC (Amsterdam Astron Radio Transients Facility And Analysis
Centre), a transients facility based on the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR).
Results on simulated data show the efficacy of the pipeline, and from real data
it discovered dispersed pulses. The current work targets transients on time
scales that are longer than the fast transients of beam-formed search, but
shorter than slow transients in which dispersion matters less. This fills a
methodological gap that is relevant for the upcoming Square-Kilometer Array
(SKA). Additionally, since real-time analysis can be performed, only data with
promising detections can be saved to disk, providing a solution to the big-data

verification (SV). We introduce two methods to improve the meta-learning
training for SV in this paper. For the first method, a backbone embedding
network is first jointly trained with the conventional cross entropy loss and
prototypical networks (PN) loss. Then, inspired by speaker adaptive training in
speech recognition, additional transformation coefficients are trained with
only the PN loss. The transformation coefficients are used to modify the
original backbone embedding network in the x-vector extraction process.
Furthermore, the random erasing (RE) data augmentation technique is applied to
all support samples in each episode to construct positive pairs, and a
contrastive loss between the augmented and the original support samples is
added to the objective in model training. Experiments are carried out on the
Speaker in the Wild (SITW) and VOiCES databases. Both of the methods can obtain
consistent improvements over existing meta-learning training frameworks. By
combining these two methods, we can observe further improvements on these two
databases.

overcome the real-time constraint by significantly reducing the computational
complexity, we use several structure-preserving and non-structure-preserving

basis techniques. For the ARE, instead of solving a full dimensional problem we
compute a low-rank-factor and hence a low-dimensional ARE is solved. Numerical
examples for both cases are provided. These illustrate the approximation

conditions is challenging. Methods combining deep neural network encoders with

in self-supervised manner for increased robustness and better generalization.
However, their differentiable rasterization based image formation models, as
well as underlying scene parameterization, limit them to Lambertian face
reflectance and to poor shape details. More recently, ray tracing was
introduced for monocular face reconstruction within a classic
optimization-based framework and enables state-of-the art results. However
optimization-based approaches are inherently slow and lack robustness. In this
paper, we build our work on the aforementioned approaches and propose a new
method that greatly improves reconstruction quality and robustness in general
scenes. We achieve this by combining a CNN encoder with a differentiable ray
tracer, which enables us to base the reconstruction on much more advanced
personalized diffuse and specular albedos, a more sophisticated illumination
model and a plausible representation of self-shadows. This enables to take a
big leap forward in reconstruction quality of shape, appearance and lighting
even in scenes with difficult illumination. With consistent face attributes

integer solutions to these subproblems can increase the quality of solutions
and reduce the depth and branching factor of the Branch-and-Price algorithm and
hence reduce the overall running time. We investigate the viability of the
approach by considering the Tail Assignment problem and the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Here, the master problem is the optimization
problem Set Partitioning or its decision version Exact Cover and can be
expressed as finding the ground state of an Ising spin glass Hamiltonian. For
Exact Cover, our numerical results indicate that the required algorithm depth
decreases with the number of feasible solutions for a given success probability
of finding a feasible solution. For Set Partitioning, on the other hand, we
find that for a given success probability of finding the optimal solution, the
required algorithm depth can increase with the number of feasible solutions if
the Hamiltonian is balanced poorly, which in the worst case is exponential in
the problem size. We therefore address the importance of properly balancing the
objective and constraint parts of the Hamiltonian. We empirically find that the
approach is viable with QAOA if polynomial algorithm depth can be realized on
quantum devices.

electronic relaxation process. It is expected to contribute to water
fractionation during the building-up of the ice grain mantles in molecular

detection of X-ray flares from quiescent galaxies during the ROSAT all-sky
survey of 1990-1991. The flares complied with theoretical expectations, having
high peak luminosities ($L_{\rm x}$ up to $\ge4\times 10^{44}$ erg/s), a
thermal spectrum with $kT\sim$few$\times10^5$ K, and a decline on timescales of
months to years, consistent with a diminishing return of stellar debris to a
black hole of mass $10^{6-8}$ solar masses. These measurements gave solid proof
that the nuclei of quiescent galaxies are habitually populated by a
super-massive black hole. Beginning in 2000, XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift have
discovered further TDEs which have been monitored closely at multiple
wavelengths. A general picture has emerged of, initially near-Eddington
accretion, powering outflows of highly-ionised material, giving way to a calmer
sub-Eddington phase, where the flux decays monotonically, and finally a low
accretion rate phase with a harder X-ray spectrum indicative of the formation
of a disk corona. There are exceptions to this rule though which at the moment
are not well understood. A few bright X-ray TDEs have been discovered in
optical surveys but in general X-ray TDEs show little excess emission in the
optical band, at least at times coincident with the X-ray flare. X-ray TDEs are
powerful new probes of accretion physics down to the last stable orbit,
revealing the conditions necessary for launching jets and winds. Finally we see
that evidence is mounting for nuclear and non-nuclear intermediate mass black
holes based on TDE flares which are relatively hot and/or fast.

recoverable (LRC) codes. LRC codes can recover information from erasure(s) by
accessing a small number of erasure-free code symbols and increasing the
efficiency of repair processes in large-scale distributed storage systems. In
this context, Tamo and Barg first gave a breakthrough by cleverly introducing a
good polynomial notion. Constructing good polynomials for locally recoverable
codes achieving Singleton-type bound (called optimal codes) is challenging and
has attracted significant attention in recent years. This article aims to
increase our knowledge of good polynomials for optimal LRC codes. Using tools
from algebraic function fields and Galois theory, we continue investigating
those polynomials and studying them by developing the Galois theoretical
approach initiated by Micheli in 2019. Specifically, we push further the study
of a crucial parameter $\mathcal G(f)$ (of a given polynomial $f$), which
measures how much a polynomial is ""good"" in the sense of LRC codes. We provide
some characterizations of polynomials with minimal Galois groups and prove some
properties of finite fields where polynomials exist with a specific size of
Galois groups. We also present some explicit shapes of polynomials with small
Galois groups. For some particular polynomials $f$, we give the exact formula
of $\mathcal G(f)$.

Parkinson's disease. Further insight into this phenomenon is hampered by the
difficulty to objectively assess FOG. To meet this clinical need, this paper
proposes an automated motion-capture-based FOG assessment method driven by a
novel deep neural network. Automated FOG assessment can be formulated as an
action segmentation problem, where temporal models are tasked to recognize and
temporally localize the FOG segments in untrimmed motion capture trials. This
paper takes a closer look at the performance of state-of-the-art action
segmentation models when tasked to automatically assess FOG. Furthermore, a
novel deep neural network architecture is proposed that aims to better capture
the spatial and temporal dependencies than the state-of-the-art baselines. The
proposed network, termed multi-stage spatial-temporal graph convolutional
network (MS-GCN), combines the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network
(ST-GCN) and the multi-stage temporal convolutional network (MS-TCN). The
ST-GCN captures the hierarchical spatial-temporal motion among the joints
inherent to motion capture, while the multi-stage component reduces
over-segmentation errors by refining the predictions over multiple stages. The
experiments indicate that the proposed model outperforms four state-of-the-art
baselines. Moreover, FOG outcomes derived from MS-GCN predictions had an
excellent (r=0.93 [0.87, 0.97]) and moderately strong (r=0.75 [0.55, 0.87])
linear relationship with FOG outcomes derived from manual annotations. The
proposed MS-GCN may provide an automated and objective alternative to
labor-intensive clinician-based FOG assessment. Future work is now possible
that aims to assess the generalization of MS-GCN to a larger and more varied
verification cohort.

of sampling and transmitting status updates by users over a wireless channel
subject to average Age of Information (AoI) constraints. Errors in the
transmission may occur and a scheduling policy has to decide if the users
sample a new packet or attempt for retransmission of the packet sampled
previously. The cost consists of both sampling and transmission costs. The
sampling of a new packet after a failure imposes an additional cost on the
system. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem with the average cost in
the objective under average AoI constraints. To solve this problem, we propose
three scheduling policies; a) a dynamic policy, that is centralized and
requires full knowledge of the state of the system, b) two stationary
randomized policies that require no knowledge of the state of the system. We
utilize tools from Lyapunov optimization theory in order to provide the dynamic
policy, and we prove that its solution is arbitrary close to the optimal one.
In order to provide the randomized policies, we model the system by utilizing
Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC). We provide closed-form and approximated
expressions for the average AoI and its distribution, for each randomized
policy. Simulation results show the importance of providing the option to
transmit an old packet in order to minimize the total average cost.

different types of metric objectives and hard sample mining strategies with
given training data. However, learning with only the training data can be
overfitted to the seen classes, leading to the lack of generalization
capability on unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose a simple
regularizer called Proxy Synthesis that exploits synthetic classes for stronger
generalization in deep metric learning. The proposed method generates synthetic
embeddings and proxies that work as synthetic classes, and they mimic unseen
classes when computing proxy-based losses. Proxy Synthesis derives an embedding
space considering class relations and smooth decision boundaries for robustness
on unseen classes. Our method is applicable to any proxy-based losses,

benchmarks in image retrieval tasks demonstrate that Proxy Synthesis
significantly boosts the performance of proxy-based losses and achieves

Networks. However, there are no comprehensive comparisons between these two
networks, and it is also unknown which components in the CapsNet affect its
robustness. In this paper, we first carefully examine the special designs in
CapsNet that differ from that of a ConvNet commonly used for image
classification. The examination reveals five major new/different components in
CapsNet: a transformation process, a dynamic routing layer, a squashing
function, a marginal loss other than cross-entropy loss, and an additional
class-conditional reconstruction loss for regularization. Along with these
major differences, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies on three kinds of
robustness, including affine transformation, overlapping digits, and semantic
representation. The study reveals that some designs, which are thought critical
to CapsNet, actually can harm its robustness, i.e., the dynamic routing layer
and the transformation process, while others are beneficial for the robustness.
Based on these findings, we propose enhanced ConvNets simply by introducing the
essential components behind the CapsNet's success. The proposed simple ConvNets
can achieve better robustness than the CapsNet.

origin of life on Earth and other exoplanets. Here we compare, as a function of
stellar rotation rate ($\Omega$), contributions from two distinct populations
of energetic particles: stellar cosmic rays accelerated by impulsive flare
events and Galactic cosmic rays. We use a 1.5D stellar wind model combined with
a spatially 1D cosmic ray transport model. We formulate the evolution of the
stellar cosmic ray spectrum as a function of stellar rotation. The maximum
stellar cosmic ray energy increases with increasing rotation i.e., towards more
active/younger stars. We find that stellar cosmic rays dominate over Galactic
cosmic rays in the habitable zone at the pion threshold energy for all stellar
ages considered ($t_*=0.6-2.9\,$Gyr). However, even at the youngest age,
$t_*=0.6\,$Gyr, we estimate that $\gtrsim\,80$MeV stellar cosmic ray fluxes may
still be transient in time. At $\sim1\,$Gyr when life is thought to have
emerged on Earth, we demonstrate that stellar cosmic rays dominate over
Galactic cosmic rays up to $\sim$4$\,$GeV energies during flare events. Our
results for $t_*=0.6\,$Gyr ($\Omega = 4\Omega_\odot$) indicate that
$\lesssim$GeV stellar cosmic rays are advected from the star to 1$\,$au and are
impacted by adiabatic losses in this region. The properties of the inner solar
wind, currently being investigated by the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter,
are thus important for accurate calculations of stellar cosmic rays around
young Sun-like stars.

study with the construction of strictly monotone traveling front solutions with
strong exponential decay near the unstable state when the profile of the

diverse fields, training GANs on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is a
challenging task mostly due to speckle noise. On the one hands, in a learning
perspective of human's perception, it is natural to learn a task by using
various information from multiple sources. However, in the previous GAN works
on SAR target image generation, the information on target classes has only been
used. Due to the backscattering characteristics of SAR image signals, the
shapes and structures of SAR target images are strongly dependent on their pose
angles. Nevertheless, the pose angle information has not been incorporated into
such generative models for SAR target images. In this paper, we firstly propose
a novel GAN-based multi-task learning (MTL) method for SAR target image
generation, called PeaceGAN that uses both pose angle and target class
information, which makes it possible to produce SAR target images of desired
target classes at intended pose angles. For this, the PeaceGAN has two
additional structures, a pose estimator and an auxiliary classifier, at the
side of its discriminator to combine the pose and class information more
efficiently. In addition, the PeaceGAN is jointly learned in an end-to-end
manner as MTL with both pose angle and target class information, thus enhancing
the diversity and quality of generated SAR target images The extensive
experiments show that taking an advantage of both pose angle and target class
learning by the proposed pose estimator and auxiliary classifier can help the
PeaceGAN's generator effectively learn the distributions of SAR target images
in the MTL framework, so that it can better generate the SAR target images more
flexibly and faithfully at intended pose angles for desired target classes

Unfortunately, FGSM-training leads to a phenomenon called ``catastrophic

exciton decay on the doping level, with its characteristically
stretched-exponential kinetics, is attributed to diffusion-limited NR decay at
charged impurity sites. By contrast, trion decay is unimolecular with a rate
constant of $2.0\,\rm ps^{-1}$. Our experiments thus show that charged
impurities not only trap trions and scavenge mobile excitons but that they also
facilitate efficient NR energy dissipation for both.

self-repair and heal. Mechanics is critical during the healing process, as the
damaged extracellular matrix (ECM) tends to be replaced with a new undamaged
ECM supporting homeostatic stresses. Computational modeling has been commonly
used to simulate the healing process. However, there is a pressing need to have
a unified thermodynamics theory for healing. From the viewpoint of continuum
damage mechanics, some key parameters related to healing processes, for
instance, the volume fraction of newly grown soft tissue and the growth
deformation, can be regarded as internal variables and have related evolution
equations. This paper is aiming to establish this unified framework inspired by
thermodynamics for continuum damage models for the healing of soft biological
tissues. The significant advantage of the proposed model is that no \textit{ad

new model is more concise and offers a universal approach to simulate the
healing process. Three numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model, which is in good agreement with the

Learning (CIL) tasks. CIL tends to learn new concepts perfectly, but not at the

absence of data instances from previous classes or even imbalance samples of
both old and new classes makes CIL an ongoing challenging problem. These issues
can be tackled by storing exemplars belonging to the previous tasks or by
utilizing the rehearsal strategy. Inspired by the rehearsal strategy with the
approach of using generative models, we propose ClaRe, an efficient solution
for CIL by remembering the representations of learned classes in each
increment. Taking this approach leads to generating instances with the same
distribution of the learned classes. Hence, our model is somehow retrained from
the scratch using a new training set including both new and the generated
samples. Subsequently, the imbalance data problem is also solved. ClaRe has a
better generalization than prior methods thanks to producing diverse instances
from the distribution of previously learned classes. We comprehensively
evaluate ClaRe on the MNIST benchmark. Results show a very low degradation on
accuracy against facing new knowledge over time. Furthermore, contrary to the
most proposed solutions, the memory limitation is not problematic any longer

semi-automatic labeling strategy for scene text videos in this paper. We get
semi-automatic scene text annotation by labeling manually for the first frame
and tracking automatically for the subsequent frames, which avoid the huge cost
of manual labeling. Moreover, a paired low-quality scene text video dataset
named Text-RBL is proposed, consisting of raw videos, blurry videos, and
low-resolution videos, labeled by the proposed convenient semi-automatic
labeling strategy. Through an averaging operation and bicubic down-sampling
operation over the raw videos, we can efficiently obtain blurry videos and
low-resolution videos paired with raw videos separately. To verify the
effectiveness of Text-RBL, we propose a baseline model combined with the text
detector and tracker for video scene text detection. Moreover, a failure
detection scheme is designed to alleviate the baseline model drift issue caused

remote sensing at the boundaries of coronal mass ejections. While it was

triggering solar wind fluctuations, its direct and unambiguous observation in

$k^{-2.8}$ in the inertial and dissipation ranges, respectively. These
observations provide robust evidence of KHI development in the solar wind. This

the solution of unperturbed sine-Gordon equation is taken as the initial
condition. Neumann boundary condition is maintained at both the ends so that
the fluxon is capable of reflecting from the end of the system. The phase
dependent current is calculated for different tunnel voltage and averaged out
over space and time. The current-voltage characteristics are almost linear at
low voltage and non-linear at higher voltage which indicates that the more
complicated physical phenomena at this situation may occur. At some region of
the characteristics, there exist a negative resistance which means that the
junction system can be used in specific electronic devices such as oscillators,
switches, memories etc. The non-linearity is also sensitive to the layer as
well as to the junction thicknesses. Non-linearity occurs for lower voltage and

death and model collective memory as a composition of communicative and
cultural memory. Clustering reveals four patterns of post-mortem memory, and
regression analysis shows that boosts in media attention are largest for
pre-mortem popular anglophones who died a young, unnatural death; that
long-term boosts are smallest for leaders and largest for artists; and that,
while both the news and Twitter are triggered by young and unnatural deaths,
the news additionally curates collective memory when old persons or leaders
die. Overall, we illuminate the age-old question who is remembered by society,

interaction strength $\lambda$, particle size $D$ and temperature $T$ on the
hysteresis mechanism in ordered arrays of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) using
computer simulations. The anisotropy axes of the MNPs are assumed to have
random orientation to mimic the real system. In the absence of thermal
fluctuations and dipolar interaction, the hysteresis follows the Stoner and
Wohlfarth model irrespective of $D$, as expected. The hysteresis loop area is
minimal for particle sizes $D \approx8-16$ nm at $T=300$ K and $\lambda=0.0$,
indicating the dominance of superparamagnetic character. Switching magnetic
interaction on is able to move the MNPs from superparamagnetic to a
ferromagnetic state even at room temperature; therefore, magnetic interaction
of enough strength enhances the hysteresis loop area. Interestingly, the
hysteresis loop area is significant and is the same as that of Stoner and
Wohlfarth particle even $T=300$ K and negligible dipolar interaction for
ferromagnetic MNPs ($D>16$ nm). The coercive field $\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$ and
blocking temperature $T^{}_B$ also get enhanced with an increase in $\lambda$
and $D$. The rigorous analysis of the coercive field $\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$ vs
temperature data also reveals significant deviation from $T^{3/4}$ dependence
of $\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$ because of dipolar interaction. The amount of heat
dissipated $E^{}_H$ and $\mu_oH^{}_c$ decrease rapidly with $T$ for $D\approx
8-16$ nm and $\lambda\leq0.6$. On the other hand, $E^{}_H$ and $\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$
depend weakly on $T$ with $D>16$ nm, even in the weak dipolar limit. The
present work should provide a better understanding of magnetic hyperthermia to
researchers working on this subject. For physicists, it would be interesting to
test experimentally the results described in this article.

propose novel algorithms for these problems using a single 3D point of unknown

cool-core clusters, are believed to be powered by hot gas accretion directly
from their surrounding hot X-ray emitting gaseous medium. This leads to a giant
Bondi-type spherical/quasi-spherical accretion flow onto their host SMBHs, with
the accretion flow region extending well beyond the Bondi radius. In this work,
we present a detailed study of Bondi-type spherical flow in the context of
these massive ellipticals by incorporating the effect of entire gravitational
potential of the host galaxy in the presence of cosmological constant
$\Lambda$, considering a five-component galactic system (SMBH + stellar + dark
matter + hot gas + $\Lambda$). The current work is an extension of Ghosh \&
Banik (2015), who studied only the cosmological aspect of the problem. The
galactic contribution to the potential renders the (adiabatic) spherical flow
to become {\it multi-transonic} in nature, with the flow topology and flow
structure significantly deviating from that of classical Bondi solution. More
notably, corresponding to moderate to higher values of galactic mass-to-light
ratios, we obtain Rankine-Hugoniot shocks in spherical wind flows. Galactic
potential enhances the Bondi accretion rate. Our study reveals that there is a
strict lower limit of ambient temperature below which no Bondi accretion can be
triggered; which is as high as $\sim 9 \times 10^6 \, K$ for flows from hot
ISM-phase, indicating that the hot phase tightly regulates the fueling of host
nucleus. Our findings may have wider implications, particularly in the context
of outflow/jet dynamics, and radio-AGN feedback, associated with these massive
galaxies in the contemporary Universe.

effect of both IQI and RHI on the performance of a WCS subject to the sum of
Fox's H-function fading model (SFHF) is investigated. Such a fading model
generalizes most, if not all, of well-known fading and turbulence models. To
this end, closed-form and asymptotic expressions for the outage probability
(OP), channel capacity (CC) under constant power with optimum rate adaptation
(ORA) policy, and average symbol error probability (ASEP) for both coherent and
non-coherent modulation schemes. Specifically, all the analytical expressions
are derived for three different scenarios: (i) ideal Tx and Rx impaired, (ii)
Tx impaired and ideal Rx, and (iii) both Tx and Rx are impaired. Further,
asymptotic expressions for OP, CC under ORA policy, and ASEP are obtained,
based on which, insightful discussions on the IQI and RHI impacts are made.

turns into a downhill bifurcation upon substitution of fluorine by chlorine,
bromine and iodine in the thermal activation limit, the dichloro derivative is
studied systematically in the realm of mechanochemical activation. Detailed
exploration of the force-transformed potential energy surface of
trans-gem-dichlorocyclopropane in terms of Dijkstra path analysis unveils a
hitherto unknown topological catastrophe where the global shape of the energy
landscape is fundamentally changed. From thermal activation up to moderately
large forces, it is an uphill bifurcation that decides about dis-versus
conrotatory ring-opening followed by separate transition states along both
pathways. Above a critical force, the two distinct transition states merge to
yield a single transition state such that the decision about the dis-versus
conrotatory ring-opening process is taken at a newly established downhill
bifurcation. The discovery of a force-induced qualitative change of the
topology of a reaction network vastly transcends the previous understanding of
the ring-opening reaction of this species. It would be astonishing to not
discover a wealth of such catastrophes for mechanochemically activated
reactions which will greatly extend the known opportunities to manipulate

abrupt shifts of ecosystems. A few previous studies have shown that demographic
noise -- arising from the probabilistic and discrete nature of birth and death
processes in finite systems -- makes the transitions gradual or continuous. In
this paper, we show that demographic noise may, in fact, promote abrupt
transitions in systems that would otherwise show continuous transitions. We
present our methods and results in a tutorial-like format. We begin with a
simple spatially-explicit individual-based model with local births and deaths
influenced by positive feedback processes. We then derive a stochastic
differential equation that describes how local probabilistic rules scale to
stochastic population dynamics. The infinite-size well-mixed limit of this SDE
for our model is consistent with mean-field models of abrupt regime-shifts.
Finally, we analytically show that as a consequence of demographic noise,
finite-size systems can undergo abrupt shifts even with weak positive
interactions. Numerical simulations of our spatially-explicit model confirm
this prediction. Thus, we predict that small-sized populations and ecosystems
may undergo abrupt collapse even when larger systems - with the same
microscopic interactions - show a smooth response to environmental stress.

intractable and even numerical evaluation of these estimators may be hard to
compute for large networks. In this paper, we propose a graph signal processing
(GSP) framework for random graph signal recovery that utilizes the information
of the structure behind the data. First, we develop the GSP-linear minimum
mean-squared-error (GSP-LMMSE) estimator, which minimizes the mean-squared
error (MSE) among estimators that are represented as an output of a graph
filter. The GSP-LMMSE estimator is based on diagonal covariance matrices in the
graph frequency domain, and thus, has reduced complexity compared with the
LMMSE estimator. This property is especially important when using the
sample-mean versions of these estimators that are based on a training dataset.
We then state conditions under which the low-complexity GSP-LMMSE estimator
coincides with the optimal LMMSE estimator. Next, we develop the approximated
parametrization of the GSP-LMMSE estimator by shift-invariant graph filters by
solving a weighted least squared (WLS) problem. We present three
implementations of the parametric GSP-LMMSE estimator for typical graph
filters. Parametric graph filters are more robust to outliers and to network
topology changes. In our simulations, we evaluate the performance of the
proposed GSP-LMMSE estimators for the problem of state estimation in power
systems, which can be interpreted as a graph signal recovery task. We show that
the proposed sample-GSP estimators outperform the sample-LMMSE estimator for a

we address the problem of determining under which conditions a renormalization

key step, we provide a differential-geometric interpretation of renormalization
that allows us to apply the Poincar\'e-Dulac theorem to the problem above: We
interpret a change of renormalization scheme as a (formal) holomorphic gauge
transformation, $-\frac{\gamma(g)}{\beta(g)}$ as a (formal) meromorphic
connection with a Fuchsian singularity at $g=0$, and $Z(x,\mu)$ as a Wilson
line, with $\gamma(g)=\gamma_0 g^2 + \cdots$ the matrix of the anomalous
dimensions and $\beta(g)=-\beta_0 g^3 +\cdots$ the beta function. As a
consequence of the Poincar\'e-Dulac theorem, if the eigenvalues $\lambda_1,
\lambda_2, \cdots $ of the matrix $\frac{\gamma_0}{\beta_0}$, in nonincreasing
order $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots$, satisfy the nonresonant condition
$\lambda_i -\lambda_j -2k \neq 0$ for $i\leq j$ and $k$ a positive integer,
then a renormalization scheme exists where $-\frac{\gamma(g)}{\beta(g)} =
\frac{\gamma_0}{\beta_0} \frac{1}{g}$ is one-loop exact to all perturbative
orders. If in addition $\frac{\gamma_0}{\beta_0}$ is diagonalizable, $Z(x,
\mu)$ is diagonalizable as well, and the mixing reduces essentially to the
multiplicatively renormalizable case. We also classify the remaining cases of
operator mixing by the Poincar\'e-Dulac theorem.

different homogeneous relation-type graphs, which are then combined to create
higher-order relation-type representations. These representations preserve the
heterogeneity of edges and retain their edge directions while capturing the
interaction of different vertex types multiple hops apart. This is then
complemented with attention mechanisms to distinguish the importance of the

some novel results, such as Debye temperatures, and sound velocities are
obtained. Moreover, we have presented the results of the electronic band
structure, densities of states and charge densities. These results were in
favourable agreement with the existing theoretical data. The optical dielectric
function and energy loss spectrum of both systems are also computed. Born
effective charge (BEC) of each atoms for both systems is computed from

also determined from modern theory of polarization to be 0.8662 C/m2 (PSTO) and
1.0824 C/m2 (PSTZO).

produce accurate human pose. Second, the GSN is designed to contribute to the

According to GAN, if the prediction pose produced by the generator G cannot be

obtained the underlying dependence of human joints. We conduct experiments on
three widely used human pose estimation benchmark datasets, LSP, MPII and COCO,

capturing the distribution of patches within a single image. The classical (pre
Deep Learning) prevailing approaches for these tasks are based on an
optimization process that maximizes patch similarity between the input and
generated output. Recently, however, Single Image GANs were introduced both as
a superior solution for such manipulation tasks, but also for remarkable novel
generative tasks. Despite their impressiveness, single image GANs require long
training time (usually hours) for each image and each task. They often suffer
from artifacts and are prone to optimization issues such as mode collapse. In
this paper, we show that all of these tasks can be performed without any
training, within several seconds, in a unified, surprisingly simple framework.
We revisit and cast the ""good-old"" patch-based methods into a novel
optimization-free framework. We start with an initial coarse guess, and then
simply refine the details coarse-to-fine using patch-nearest-neighbor search.
This allows generating random novel images better and much faster than GANs. We
further demonstrate a wide range of applications, such as image editing and
reshuffling, retargeting to different sizes, structural analogies, image
collage and a newly introduced task of conditional inpainting. Not only is our
method faster ($\times 10^3$-$\times 10^4$ than a GAN), it produces superior
results (confirmed by quantitative and qualitative evaluation), less artifacts
and more realistic global structure than any of the previous approaches
(whether GAN-based or classical patch-based).

  Tuning","Accepted by CVPR 2021",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that mislead the
models with imperceptible perturbations. Though adversarial attacks have
achieved incredible success rates in the white-box setting, most existing
adversaries often exhibit weak transferability in the black-box setting,
especially under the scenario of attacking models with defense mechanisms. In
this work, we propose a new method called variance tuning to enhance the class
of iterative gradient based attack methods and improve their attack
transferability. Specifically, at each iteration for the gradient calculation,
instead of directly using the current gradient for the momentum accumulation,
we further consider the gradient variance of the previous iteration to tune the
current gradient so as to stabilize the update direction and escape from poor
local optima. Empirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate
that our method could significantly improve the transferability of
gradient-based adversarial attacks. Besides, our method could be used to attack
ensemble models or be integrated with various input transformations.
Incorporating variance tuning with input transformations on iterative
gradient-based attacks in the multi-model setting, the integrated method could
achieve an average success rate of 90.1% against nine advanced defense methods,
improving the current best attack performance significantly by 85.1% . Code is

transients (FOTs). These FOTs can usually rise and decline remarkably in a
timescale of a few days to weeks, which are obviously much rapider than
ordinary supernovae. SN 2019bkc/ATLAS19dqr is one of the fastest detected FOTs

These discoveries provide a good chance to explore the possible origins of

SN 2019bkc can be well explained by the thermal emission of an explosion ejecta

spinning-down millisecond magnetar or a fallback accretion onto a compact

curb the transmission of Covid-19 are all too familiar, but the consequences of
isolation and loneliness resulting from those measures on the mental well-being
of the population and their ensuing long-term economic effects are largely
unknown. Here we offer a stochastic agent-based model to investigate social
restriction measures in a community where the feelings of loneliness of the
agents dwindle when they are socializing and grow when they are alone. In
addition, the intensity of those feelings, which are measured by a real
variable that we term degree of loneliness, determines whether the agent will
seek social contact or not. We find that decrease of the number, quality or
duration of social contacts lead the community to enter a regime of burnout in
which the degree of loneliness diverges, although the number of lonely agents
at a given moment amounts to only a fraction of the total population. This
regime of mental breakdown is separated from the healthy regime, where the
degree of loneliness is finite, by a continuous phase transition. We show that
the community dynamics is described extremely well by a simple mean-field
theory so our conclusions can be easily verified for different scenarios and
parameter settings. The appearance of the burnout regime illustrates neatly the
side effects of social distancing, which give to many of us the choice between

inspects the visual attributes of a seed such as size, shape, area, color and

labor-intensive. Advances in the areas of computer vision and deep learning
have led to the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN) that aid in
classification using images. While they classify efficiently, a key bottleneck
is the need for an extensive amount of labelled data to train the CNN before it
can be put to the task of classification. The work leverages the concepts of
Contrastive Learning and Domain Randomi-zation in order to achieve the same.
Briefly, domain randomization is the technique of applying models trained on
images containing simulated objects to real-world objects. The use of synthetic
images generated from a representational sample crop of real-world images
alleviates the need for a large volume of test subjects. As part of the work,
synthetic image datasets of five different types of seed images namely, canola,

(ii) Refining-step: We narrow the supporting evidence down by measuring the
semantic distance of the text with the collection from step (i). The distance
is calculated based on Word2Vec and the Word Mover's Distance. In our

considered as supporting evidence. We find that our approach is agnostic to
concept drifts, i.e. the machine learning task is independent of the hypotheses

widely in major metropolitan areas in the US in the unlicensed 5 GHz bands,
which have existing dense deployments of Wi-Fi. This provides a real-world
opportunity to study the problems due to hidden-node scenarios between LAA and
Wi-Fi. The hidden node problem has been well studied in the context of
overlapping Wi-Fi APs. However, when Wi-Fi coexists with LAA, the hidden node
problem is exacerbated since LAA cannot use the well-known Request-to-Send
(RTS)/Clear to-Send (CTS) mechanism to resolve contentions, resulting in
throughput degradation for Wi-Fi. In this paper, we describe detailed
measurements and conclusions from experiments on the campus of the University
of Chicago which presents a perfect hidden node scenario where Wi-Fi access
points (APs) controlled by us and an LAA base-station (BS) deployed by AT&T are
hidden from each other, but the clients are not. We performed careful
experiments in three different regions of the coexistence area: (i) clients
midway between LAA & Wi-Fi; (ii) clients close to the Wi-Fi AP; and (iii)
clients close to the LAA BS. Our results show that in a situation where LAA
uses an aggregate of three unlicensed channels (60 MHz bandwidth) which overlap
with an 80 MHz Wi-Fi transmission, the Wi-Fi throughput at client devices
suffers considerably. Overall, Wi-Fi performance is impacted by the hidden node
problem more severely than LAA. In the best outdoor conditions, the throughput
of LAA and Wi-Fi is reduced by 35% and 97% respectively when coexisting with
each other as compared when the other system is not present. Furthermore, we
conclude that when both LAA and Wi-Fi use multiple 20 MHz channels and there
are multiple Wi-Fi APs coexisting with LAA on the same set of channels, the

approach leverages plane-swept cost volumes (widely used in multi-view stereo)
for geometry-aware scene reasoning, and combines this with physically based
volume rendering for neural radiance field reconstruction. We train our network
on real objects in the DTU dataset, and test it on three different datasets to
evaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalize
across scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our training
scenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using only
three input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works on
generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images are
captured, our estimated radiance field representation can be easily fine-tuned;
this leads to fast per-scene reconstruction with higher rendering quality and
substantially less optimization time than NeRF.

retargeting while considering physical constraints of the motion in 3D and the

composed of different videos with annotated human motions to evaluate the task
of synthesizing people's videos, which can be used as a common base to improve
tracking the progress in the field. The dataset and its evaluation protocols
are designed to evaluate retargeting methods in more general and challenging

This paper provides a comprehensive review of graph-based FAA, including the

approaches widely used for graph-based affective representation in literature
and show a trend towards graph construction. For the relational reasoning in
graph-based FAA, existing studies are categorized according to their non-deep

Performance comparisons of the state-of-the-art graph-based FAA methods are

resonator's performance - often quantified by its Qf product (where Q is
quality factor and f is frequency) - through nanomechanical engineering such as
dissipation dilution and strain engineering, has been driven by human intuition
and insight. Such an approach is inefficient and leaves aside a plethora of
unexplored mechanical designs that potentially achieve better performance.
Here, we use a computer-aided inverse design approach known as topology
optimization to structurally design mechanical resonators with optimal
performance of the fundamental mechanical mode. Using the outcomes of this
approach, we fabricate and characterize ultra-coherent nanomechanical
resonators with record-high Qf products, entering a quantum coherent regime
where coherent oscillations are observed at room temperature. Further
refinements to the model describing the mechanical system are likely to improve
the Qf product even more. The proposed approach - which can be also used to
improve phononic crystal and coupled-mode resonators - opens up a new paradigm
for designing ultra-coherent micro- and nanomechanical resonators for

to non-zero total and open magnetic flux also in the deepest grand minima, such

algorithms, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), are
first used in standalone mode to solve well control optimization problem. Next,
both GA and PSO methods are used with another popular optimization algorithm,
covariance matrix adaptation-evolution strategy (CMA-ES), in hybrid mode.
Hybrid optimization run is made by transferring the resulting population from
one algorithm to the next as its starting population for further improvement.
Approximately four thousand simulation runs are needed for standalone GA and
PSO methods to converge, while six thousand runs are needed in case of two
hybrid optimization modes (GA-CMA-ES and PSO-CMA-ES). To reduce turn-around

the gyration radius distributions for Gaussian star and Gaussian rosette
macromolecules. We derive the analytical expressions for cumulants of the both
distributions. Applying the steepest descent method, we estimate the
probability distribution functions of the gyration radius in the limit of a
large number of star and rosette arms in two limiting regimes: for strongly
expanded and strongly collapsed macromolecules. We show that in both cases, in
the regime of a large gyration radius relative to its mean-square value, the
probability distribution functions can be described by the Gaussian functions.
In the shrunk macromolecule regime, both distribution functions tend to zero
faster than any power of the gyration radius. Based on the asymptotic behavior
of the distribution functions and the behavior of statistical dispersions, we
demonstrate that the probability distribution function for the rosette is more
densely localized near its maximum than that for the star polymer. We construct
the interpolation formula for the gyration radius distribution for the Gaussian
star macromolecule which can help to take into account the conformational
entropy of the flexible star macromolecules within the Flory-type mean-field
theories

mechanism leads to interface recombination without a reduced interface bandgap

networks of reversible agents suffer some shortcomings. Despite multiple
attempts, reversible declensions of the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS)
do not offer satisfactory adaptation of notions that are usual in
''forward-only'' process algebras, such as replication or context. They also
seem to fail to leverage possible new features stemming from reversibility,
such as the capacity of distinguishing between multiple replications, based on
how they replicate the memory mechanism allowing to reverse the computation.
Existing formalisms disallow the ''hot-plugging'' of processes during their
execution in contexts that also have a past. Finally, they assume the existence
of ''eternally fresh'' keys or identifiers that, if implemented poorly, could
result in unnecessary bottlenecks and look-ups involving all the threads. In
this paper, we begin investigating those issues, by first designing a process
algebra endowed with a mechanism to generate identifiers without the need to
consult with the other threads. We use this calculus to recast the possible
representations of non-determinism in CCS, and as a by-product establish a
simple and straightforward definition of concurrency. Our reversible calculus
is then proven to satisfy expected properties, and allows to lay out precisely
different representations of the replication of a process with a memory. We
also observe that none of the reversible bisimulations defined thus far are
congruences under our notion of ''reversible'' contexts.

for models and their partial derivatives. The algorithms are tested on a set of
19 synthetic and four real-world regression problems. Both algorithms are able
to identify models which conform to shape constraints which is not the case for
the unmodified symbolic regression algorithms. However, the predictive accuracy
of models with constraints is worse on the training set and the test set.
Shape-constrained polynomial regression produces the best results for the test

innate task across various fields. Since each experiment has costs associated
with it, selecting statistically significant experiments becomes necessary.
Classic linear experimental design deals with experiment selection so as to
minimize (functions of) variance in estimation of regression parameter.
Typically, standard algorithms for solving this problem assume that data
associated with each experiment is fully known. This isn't often true since
missing data is a common problem. For instance, remote sensors often miss data
due to poor connection. Hence experiment selection under such scenarios is a
widespread but challenging task. Though decoupling the tasks and using standard
data imputation methods like matrix completion followed by experiment selection
might seem a way forward, they perform sub-optimally since the tasks are
naturally interdependent. Standard design of experiments is an NP hard problem,
and the additional objective of imputing for missing data amplifies the
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a maximum-entropy-principle
based framework that simultaneously addresses the problem of design of
experiments as well as the imputation of missing data. Our algorithm exploits
homotopy from a suitably chosen convex function to the non-convex cost
function; hence avoiding poor local minima. Further, our proposed framework is
flexible to incorporate additional application specific constraints.
Simulations on various datasets show improvement in the cost value by over 60%
in comparison to benchmark algorithms applied sequentially to the imputation
and experiment selection problems.

the generated features change during the learning process. In this work, we
argue that this transformation not only can be fixed (i.e. set as
non-trainable) with no loss of accuracy and with a reduction in memory usage,
but it can also be used to learn stationary and maximally separated embeddings.
We show that the stationarity of the embedding and its maximal separated
representation can be theoretically justified by setting the weights of the
fixed classifier to values taken from the coordinate vertices of the three
regular polytopes available in $\mathbb{R}^d$, namely: the $d$-Simplex, the
$d$-Cube and the $d$-Orthoplex. These regular polytopes have the maximal amount
of symmetry that can be exploited to generate stationary features angularly
centered around their corresponding fixed weights. Our approach improves and
broadens the concept of a fixed classifier, recently proposed in

Kruskal's original permutation lemma, and hence still cannot certify uniqueness

implementation of this technology is not at an expected speed, specifically
because of lack of application-specific details. In this paper, we propose a
novel digital twin framework for stochastic nonlinear multi-degree of freedom
(MDOF) dynamical systems. The approach proposed in this paper strategically
decouples the problem into two time-scales -- (a) a fast time-scale governing
the system dynamics and (b) a slow time-scale governing the degradation in the
system. The proposed digital twin has four components - (a) a physics-based
nominal model (low-fidelity), (b) a Bayesian filtering algorithm a (c) a
supervised machine learning algorithm and (d) a high-fidelity model for
predicting future responses. The physics-based nominal model combined with
Bayesian filtering is used combined parameter state estimation and the
supervised machine learning algorithm is used for learning the temporal
evolution of the parameters. While the proposed framework can be used with any
choice of Bayesian filtering and machine learning algorithm, we propose to use
unscented Kalman filter and Gaussian process. Performance of the proposed
approach is illustrated using two examples. Results obtained indicate the
applicability and excellent performance of the proposed digital twin framework.

from a collection of data mostly from Venus Express experiments and coordinated
ground-based telescope campaigns, in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere of
Venus. These simulations result in an overall better agreement with temperature
observations above 90 km, compared with previous versions of the VGCM. Density
of CO2 and light species (CO and O) are also comparable with observations in
terms of trend and order of magnitude. Systematic biases in the temperature
structure are found at about 80-100 km and above 130 km at the terminator,
possibly due to assumptions on the CO2 mixing ratio made for stellar/solar
occultation retrievals and uncertainties on the collisional rate coefficients
used in the non-LTE parameterization, respectively. Diurnal and latitudinal
distribution of dynamical tracers are also analyzed. Overall, our simulations
indicate that a weak westward retrograde wind is present up to about 120 km,
producing the CO bulge displacement toward 2h-3h in the morning, instead of
piling up at the anti-solar point, as for an idealised SS-AS circulation. This
retrograde imbalance is suggested to be produced by perturbations of about 5
days Kelvin wave impacting the mesosphere up to 110 km (see the companion paper
Navarro et al. 2021), combined with GW westward acceleration mostly above 110

accurately reproduce the band structure in a large energy window from -0.3 eV

characterize the nontrivial topology and the corresponding edge states. Our TB
model can also capture the anisotropic strain effects on the band structure and
the strain-induced metal-insulator transition. Moreover, we found that although
$MX_2$ share the same crystal structures and have the same crystal symmetries,
while the orbital composition of states around the Fermi level are
qualitatively different and their lower-energy properties cannot fully
described by a single k $\cdot$ p model. Thus, we construct two different types
of k $\cdot$ p model for $M$S$_2$,$M$Se$_2$ and $M$Te$_2$, respectively.
Benefiting from the high accuracy and simplicity, our TB and k $\cdot$ p models

pursuers and multiple evaders. Although both the pursuers (robots) and the
evaders are aware of each others' control and assignment strategies, they do
not have exact information about the other type of agents' location or action.
Using only noisy on-board sensors the pursuers (or evaders) make probabilistic
estimation of positions of the evaders (or pursuers). Each type of agent use
Markov localization to update the probability distribution of the other type. A
search-based control strategy is developed for the pursuers that intrinsically
takes the probability distribution of the evaders into account. Pursuers are
assigned using an assignment algorithm that takes redundancy (i.e., an excess
in the number of pursuers than the number of evaders) into account, such that
the total or maximum estimated time to capture the evaders is minimized. In
this respect we assume the pursuers to have clear advantage over the evaders.
However, the objective of this work is to use assignment strategies that
minimize the capture time. This assignment strategy is based on a modified
Hungarian algorithm as well as a novel algorithm for determining assignment of
redundant pursuers. The evaders, in order to effectively avoid the pursuers,
predict the assignment based on their probabilistic knowledge of the pursuers
and use a control strategy to actively move away from those pursues. Our
experimental evaluation shows that the redundant assignment algorithm performs
better than an alternative nearest-neighbor based assignment algorithm.

several situations; examples include the early universe, magnetars, and
heavy-ion collisions. These examples share a common trait: time evolution. A
prominent QCD property impacted by a strong magnetic field is the quark
condensate, an approximate order parameter of the QCD transition between a
high-temperature quark-gluon phase and a low-temperature hadronic phase. We use
the linear sigma model with quarks to address the quark condensate time
evolution under a strong magnetic field. We use the closed time path formalism
of nonequilibrium quantum field theory to integrate out the quarks and obtain a
mean-field Langevin equation for the condensate. The Langevin equation features
dissipation and noise kernels controlled by a damping coefficient. We compute
the damping coefficient for magnetic field and temperature values achieved in
peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions and solve the Langevin equation
for a temperature quench scenario. The magnetic field changes the dissipation
and noise pattern by increasing the damping coefficient compared to the
zero-field case. An increased damping coefficient increases fluctuations and
time scales controlling condensate's short-time evolution, a feature that can
impact hadron formation at the QCD transition. The formalism developed here can
be extended to include other order parameters, hydrodynamic modes, and system's
expansion to address magnetic field effects in complex settings as heavy-ion
collisions, the early universe, and magnetars.

closed-form deterministic plane-wave representation of the channel impulse
response. This serves as a basis for deriving a stochastic representation of
the channel in terms of statistically independent Gaussian random coefficients
for spatially stationary random propagation environments. The very desirable
property of spatial stationarity can always be retained in the radiative

adversarial robustness when compared with MLP-Mixer and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) including ConvNeXt, and this observation also holds for
certified robustness. Through frequency analysis and feature visualization, we
summarize the following main observations contributing to the improved
robustness of ViTs: 1) Features learned by ViTs contain less high-frequency
patterns that have spurious correlation, which helps explain why ViTs are less
sensitive to high-frequency perturbations than CNNs and MLP-Mixer, and there is
a high correlation between how much the model learns high-frequency features
and its robustness against different frequency-based perturbations. 2)
Introducing convolutional or tokens-to-token blocks for learning high-frequency
features in ViTs can improve classification accuracy but at the cost of
adversarial robustness. 3) Modern CNN designs that borrow techniques from ViTs
including activation function, layer norm, larger kernel size to imitate the
global attention, and patchify the images as inputs, etc., could help bridge
the performance gap between ViTs and CNNs not only in terms of performance, but
also certified and empirical adversarial robustness. Moreover, we show
adversarial training is also applicable to ViT for training robust models, and
sharpness-aware minimization can also help improve robustness, while
pre-training with clean images on larger datasets does not significantly
improve adversarial robustness.

starting point for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we
present a different perspective which focuses on missing observations as the
source of statistical uncertainty, with the parameter of interest being known
precisely given the entire population. We argue that the foundation of Bayesian
inference is to assign a distribution on missing observations conditional on
what has been observed. In the conditionally i.i.d. setting with an observed
sample of size $n$, the Bayesian would thus assign a predictive distribution on
the missing $Y_{n+1:\infty}$ conditional on $Y_{1:n}$, which then induces a
distribution on the parameter. Demonstrating an application of martingales,
Doob shows that choosing the Bayesian predictive distribution returns the
conventional posterior as the distribution of the parameter. Taking this as our
cue, we relax the predictive machine, avoiding the need for the predictive to
be derived solely from the usual prior to posterior to predictive density
formula. We introduce the \textit{martingale posterior distribution}, which
returns Bayesian uncertainty directly on any statistic of interest without the
need for the likelihood and prior, and this distribution can be sampled through
a computational scheme we name \textit{predictive resampling}. To that end, we
introduce new predictive methodologies for multivariate density estimation,
regression and classification that build upon recent work on bivariate copulas.

computationally efficient approximation of the well-known Gibbs sampling
method. The algorithm is simple and effective and has been used successfully to
address problems in various fields of applied science. However, the approximate
nature of the algorithm has prevented it from being widely used: the Markov
chains generated by the Griddy Gibbs sampling method are not reversible in
general, so the existence and uniqueness of its invariant measure is not
guaranteed. Even when such an invariant measure uniquely exists, there was no
estimate of the distance between it and the probability distribution of
interest, hence no means to ensure the validity of the algorithm as a means to
sample from the true distribution.
  In this paper, we show, subject to some fairly natural conditions, that the
Griddy Gibbs method has a unique, invariant measure. Moreover, we provide $L^p$
estimates on the distance between this invariant measure and the corresponding
measure obtained from Gibbs sampling. These results provide a theoretical
foundation for the use of the Griddy Gibbs sampling method. We also address a
more general result about the sensitivity of invariant measures under small
perturbations on the transition probability. That is, if we replace the
transition probability $P$ of any Monte Carlo Markov chain by another
transition probability $Q$ where $Q$ is close to $P$, we can still estimate the
distance between the two invariant measures. The distinguishing feature between
our approach and previous work on convergence of perturbed Markov chain is that
by considering the invariant measures as fixed points of linear operators on
function spaces, we don't need to impose any further conditions on the rate of
convergence of the Markov chain.

(NNs) for making predictions with a minimum expected risk. Our approach
combines the best of both worlds, the data efficiency and interpretability of a
BM with the speed of a NN. For a BM, making predictions with the lowest
expected loss requires integrating over the posterior distribution. When exact
inference of the posterior predictive distribution is intractable,
approximation methods are typically applied, e.g. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.
For MC, the variance of the estimator decreases with the number of samples -
but at the expense of increased computational cost. Our approach removes the
need for iterative MC simulation on the CPU at prediction time. In brief, it
works by fitting a NN to synthetic data generated using the BM. In a single
feed-forward pass, the NN gives a set of point-wise approximations to the BM's
posterior predictive distribution for a given observation. We achieve risk

either modality. Existing approaches for this task all focus on how to design
encoding model through a hard negative ranking loss, leaving two key problems
unaddressed during this procedure. First, in the training stage, only a
mini-batch of instance pairs is available in each iteration. Therefore, this
kind of hard negatives is locally mined inside a mini-batch while ignoring the
global negative samples among the dataset. Second, there are many text
descriptions for one video and each text only describes certain local features
of a video. Previous works for this task did not consider to fuse the multiply
texts corresponding to a video during the training. In this paper, to solve the
above two problems, we propose a novel memory enhanced embedding learning
(MEEL) method for videotext retrieval. To be specific, we construct two kinds
of memory banks respectively: cross-modal memory module and text center memory
module. The cross-modal memory module is employed to record the instance
embeddings of all the datasets for global negative mining. To avoid the fast
evolving of the embedding in the memory bank during training, we utilize a
momentum encoder to update the features by a moving-averaging strategy. The
text center memory module is designed to record the center information of the

only detected direct evidence of atmospheric escape in hot Jupiters and warm
Neptunes. The paucity of cases for intermediate, Saturn-sized exoplanets at

underlying physics in atmospheric escape of hot gas giants. Our objectives here
are to assess the high-energy environment of the warm ($T_\mathrm{eq} = 970$ K)
Saturn WASP-29 b and search for signatures of atmospheric escape. We used
far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations from the Hubble Space Telescope to analyze
the flux time series of H I, C II, Si III, Si IV, and N V during the transit of
WASP-29 b. At 3$\sigma$ confidence, we rule out any in-transit absorption of H
Ilarger than 92% in the Lyman-$\alpha$ blue wing and 19% in the red wing. We
found an in-transit flux decrease of $39\%^{+12\%}_{-11\%}$ in the ground-state
C II emission line at 133.45 nm. But due to this signal being significantly
present in only one visit, it is difficult to attribute a planetary or stellar
origin for the ground-state C II signal. We place 3$\sigma$ absorption upper
limits of 40%, 49% and 24% for Si III, Si IV, and for excited-state C II at
133.57 nm, respectively. Low activity levels and the faint X-ray luminosity
suggest that WASP-29 is an old, inactive star. An energy-limited approximation
combined with the reconstructed EUV spectrum of the host suggests that the
planet is losing its atmosphere at a rate of $4 \times 10^9$ g s$^{-1}$. The
non-detection at Lyman-$\alpha$ could be partly explained by a low fraction of
escaping neutral hydrogen, or by the state of fast radiative blow-out we infer
from the reconstructed stellar Lyman-$\alpha$ line.

radar-communications (JRC) systems in high-mobility scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel ICI-aware sensing algorithm for MIMO-OFDM JRC systems to
detect the presence of multiple targets and estimate their delay-Doppler-angle
parameters. First, leveraging the observation that spatial covariance matrix is
independent of target delays and Dopplers, we perform angle estimation via the
MUSIC algorithm. For each estimated angle, we next formulate the radar
delay-Doppler estimation as a joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel
estimation problem via an APES (amplitude and phase estimation) spatial
filtering approach by transforming the delay-Doppler parameterized radar
channel into an unstructured form. To account for the presence of multiple
targets at a given angle, we devise an iterative interference cancellation
based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) procedure, where at each iteration the
generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector is employed to form decision
statistics, providing as by-products the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of
radar channels and CFOs. In the final step, target detection is performed in
delay-Doppler domain using target-specific, ICI-decontaminated channel
estimates over time and frequency, where CFO estimates are utilized to resolve
Doppler ambiguities, thereby turning ICI from foe to friend. The proposed
algorithm can further exploit the ICI effect to introduce an additional
dimension (namely, CFO) for target resolvability, which enables resolving
targets located at the same delay-Doppler-angle cell. Simulation results
illustrate the ICI exploitation capability of the proposed approach and
showcase its superior detection and estimation performance in high-mobility
scenarios over conventional methods.

standard transparent materials have been limited to refractive indices smaller
than 3 in the visible, recent metamaterials designs have achieved refractive
indices above 5, accompanied by high losses, and near the phase transition of a
ferroelectric perovskite a broadband index above 26 has been claimed. In this
work, we derive fundamental limits to the refractive index of any material,
given only the underlying electron density and either the maximum allowable
dispersion or the minimum bandwidth of interest. The Kramers--Kronig relations
provide a representation for any passive (and thereby causal) material, and a
well-known sum rule constrains the possible distribution of oscillator
strengths. In the realm of small to modest dispersion, our bounds are closely
approached and not surpassed by a wide range of natural materials, showing that
nature has already nearly reached a Pareto frontier for refractive index and
dispersion. Surprisingly, our bound shows a cube-root dependence on electron
density, meaning that a refractive index of 26 over all visible frequencies is
likely impossible. Conversely, for narrow-bandwidth applications, nature does
not provide the highly dispersive, high-index materials that our bounds suggest
should be possible. We use the theory of composites to identify metal-based
metamaterials that can exhibit small losses and sizeable increases in
refractive index over the current best materials.

implemented in the Minlog proof system and the extracted terms are further
translated into Haskell. We compare two approaches. The first approach is a

represenation and using the completeness of the Cauchy-reals, the proof is very
short. In both cases we use Minlog's program extraction mechanism to
automatically extract a formally verified program that transforms a converging
sequence of reals, i.e.~a sequence of streams of binary signed digits together
with a modulus of convergence, into the binary signed digit representation of
its limit. The correctness of the extracted terms follows directly from the
soundness theorem of program extraction. As a first application we use the
extracted algorithms together with Heron's method to construct an algorithm
that computes square roots with respect to the binary signed digit

that the signed digit representation of real numbers is closed under

that the graph is $k$-connected. There is a long history of algorithmic
development for efficiently computing vertex connectivity. Recently, two near
linear-time algorithms for small k were introduced by [Forster et al. SODA

  In this paper, we study the practical performance of the algorithms by
Forster et al. In addition, we introduce a new heuristic on a key subroutine
called local cut detection, which we call degree counting. We prove that the
new heuristic improves space-efficiency (which can be good for caching

experimental results on random graphs with planted vertex cuts, random
hyperbolic graphs, and real world graphs with vertex connectivity between 4 and

is typically solved by learning a joint embedding space where the semantic

fundamental challenge in SBIR has been largely ignored so far, that is,
sketches are drawn by humans and considerable style variations exist amongst
different users. An effective SBIR model needs to explicitly account for this
style diversity, crucially, to generalise to unseen user styles. To this end, a
novel style-agnostic SBIR model is proposed. Different from existing models, a
cross-modal variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explicitly disentangle
each sketch into a semantic content part shared with the corresponding photo,
and a style part unique to the sketcher. Importantly, to make our model
dynamically adaptable to any unseen user styles, we propose to meta-train our
cross-modal VAE by adding two style-adaptive components: a set of feature
transformation layers to its encoder and a regulariser to the disentangled
semantic content latent code. With this meta-learning framework, our model can
not only disentangle the cross-modal shared semantic content for SBIR, but can
adapt the disentanglement to any unseen user style as well, making the SBIR
model truly style-agnostic. Extensive experiments show that our style-agnostic
model yields state-of-the-art performance for both category-level and

reformulating it as a differential inclusion (DI), and show that any solution
will resolve all impacts in finite time. By considering time as a state, we
embed this model into another DI which captures the continuous-time evolution

be distilled in a more effective way. In this paper, we propose a novel
knowledge distillation method, namely Complementary Relation Contrastive
Distillation (CRCD), to transfer the structural knowledge from the teacher to
the student. Specifically, we estimate the mutual relation in an anchor-based
way and distill the anchor-student relation under the supervision of its
corresponding anchor-teacher relation. To make it more robust, mutual relations
are modeled by two complementary elements: the feature and its gradient.
Furthermore, the low bound of mutual information between the anchor-teacher
relation distribution and the anchor-student relation distribution is maximized
via relation contrastive loss, which can distill both the sample representation
and the inter-sample relations. Experiments on different benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed CRCD.

to minimize a function equal to the mean hedging cost plus a constant times the
standard deviation of the hedging cost. Two situations are considered. In the
first, the asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion. In the second, the
asset price follows a stochastic volatility process. The paper extends the
basic reinforcement learning approach in a number of ways. First, it uses two
different Q-functions so that both the expected value of the cost and the
expected value of the square of the cost are tracked for different state/action
combinations. This approach increases the range of objective functions that can
be used. Second, it uses a learning algorithm that allows for continuous state
and action space. Third, it compares the accounting P&L approach (where the
hedged position is valued at each step) and the cash flow approach (where cash
inflows and outflows are used). We find that a hybrid approach involving the
use of an accounting P&L approach that incorporates a relatively simple
valuation model works well. The valuation model does not have to correspond to
the process assumed for the underlying asset price.

studying properties of ground states of strongly interacting quantum many body
systems. As it gives access to the one-particle reduced density matrix of the
ground state, it provides a perfectly tailored approach to studying the
Bose-Einstein condensation or systems of strongly correlated electrons. In
particular, for homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates as well as for the
Bose-Hubbard dimer it has been recently shown that the relevant density
functional exhibits a repulsive gradient (called the Bose-Einstein condensation
force) which diverges when the fraction of non-condensed bosons tends to zero.
In this paper, we show that the existence of the Bose-Einstein condensation
force is completely universal for any type of pair-interaction and also in the
non-homogeneous gases. To this end, we construct a universal family of
variational trial states which allows us to suitably approximate the relevant
density functional in a finite region around the set of the completely
condensed states. We also show the existence of an analogous repulsive gradient
in the fermionic RDMFT for the $N$-fermion singlet sector in the vicinity of
the set of the Hartree-Fock states. Finally, we show that our approximate
functional may perform well in electron transfer calculations involving low
numbers of electrons. This is demonstrated numerically in the Fermi-Hubbard

their safety than is currently possible. Certified control is a new safety
architecture whose goal is two-fold: to achieve a very high level of safety,
and to provide a framework for justifiable confidence in that safety. The key
idea is a runtime monitor that acts, along with sensor hardware and low-level
control and actuators, as a small trusted base, ensuring the safety of the
system as a whole.
  Unfortunately, in current systems complex perception makes the verification
even of a runtime monitor challenging. Unlike traditional runtime monitoring,
therefore, a certified control monitor does not perform perception and analysis
itself. Instead, the main controller assembles evidence that the proposed
action is safe into a certificate that is then checked independently by the
monitor. This exploits the classic gap between the costs of finding and
checking. The controller is assigned the task of finding the certificate, and
can thus use the most sophisticated algorithms available (including
learning-enabled software); the monitor is assigned only the task of checking,
and can thus run quickly and be smaller and formally verifiable.
  This paper explains the key ideas of certified control and illustrates them
with a certificate for LiDAR data and its formal verification. It shows how the
architecture dramatically reduces the amount of code to be verified, providing
an end-to-end safety analysis that would likely not be achievable in a
traditional architecture.

layers. The effectiveness of these learning-based security models is examined
by conducting a range of experiments utilizing the two most popular security
datasets, UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a
reference point for data-driven security modeling through our experimental
analysis and findings in the context of cybersecurity.

  Tomography",,,,,"eess.SP physics.app-ph physics.optics quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography (Q-OCT) is a non-classical equivalent of
Optical Coherence Tomography and is able to provide a twofold axial resolution
increase and immunity to resolution-degrading dispersion. The main drawback of
Q-OCT are artefacts which are additional elements that clutter an A-scan and
lead to a complete loss of structural information for multilayered objects.
Whereas there are successful methods for artefact removal in Time-domain Q-OCT,
no such scheme has been devised for Fourier-domain Q-OCT (Fd-Q-OCT), although
the latter modality - through joint spectrum detection - outputs a lot of
useful information on both the system and the imaged object. Here, we propose
two algorithms which process a Fd-Q-OCT's joint spectrum into an artefact-free
A-scan. We present the theoretical background of these algorithms and show
their performance on computer-generated data. The limitations of both
algorithms with regards to the experimental system and the imaged object are
discussed.

"2105.02781","Edouard Ribes","Edouard Ribes (CERNA i3)","Where are the opportunities for growth in the professional services
  space?",,,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The professional services industry (legal, accounting, consulting,
architectural services{\ldots}) employs an important share of the active
population in mature countries. However, after decades of undisputed growth,
the sector appears to be at a turning point in certain geographies. This
article therefore proposes a simple framework to help diagnose where growth
opportunities (if any) may lie.When applied to the US economic context, the
model indicates that at a macro-economic national level the sector should
stall, which concurs with the trend observed over the past decade. However, it
also highlights that a few industrial sectors (e.g. the US beverage industry)
still offer pockets of growth for a variety of professional expertises.
Replicating and fine-tuning those findings could be interesting for
practitioners to steer their marketing and business development efforts. On the
other hand, the quantitative framework presented in this study could pave the
way for future research in the academic community.
