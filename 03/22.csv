stability. Behavioural strategies may determine where species are located and
how their interactions change the local environment arrangement. In response to
stimuli in the environment, individuals may move in a specific direction
instead of walking randomly. This behaviour can be innate or learned from
experience, and allow the individuals to conquer or the maintain territory,
foraging or taking refuge. We study a generalisation of the spatial
rock-paper-scissors model where individuals of one out of the species may
perform directional movement tactics. Running a series of stochastic
simulations, we investigate the effects of the behavioural tactics on the
spatial pattern formation and the maintenance of the species diversity. We also
explore a more realistic scenario, where not all individuals are conditioned to
perform the behavioural strategy or have different levels of neighbourhood
perception. Our outcomes show that self-preservation behaviour is more
profitable in terms of territorial dominance, with the best result being
achieved when all individuals are conditioned and have a long-range vicinity
perception. On the other hand, invading is more advantageous if part of
individuals is conditioned and if they have short-range neighbourhood
perception. Finally, our findings reveal that the self-defence strategy is the
least jeopardising to biodiversity which can help biologists to understand
population dynamics in a setting where individuals may move strategically.

entropic distinguishability measure and suggesting an entanglement measure as
the difference between this entropic distinguishability and an entropic
predictability measure already defined in the literature. Besides, we prove
that it is possible to define an entanglement monotone from the largest value

discussions of LCSD platforms. In this paper, we present an empirical study of
around 5K SO posts (questions + accepted answers) that contain discussions of
nine popular LCSD platforms. We apply topic modeling on the posts to determine
the types of topics discussed. We find 13 topics related to LCSD in SO. The 13
topics are grouped into four categories: Customization, Platform Adoption,
Database Management, and Third-Party Integration. More than 40% of the
questions are about customization, i.e., developers frequently face challenges
with customizing user interfaces or services offered by LCSD platforms. The
topic ""Dynamic Event Handling"" under the ""Customization"" category is the most
popular (in terms of average view counts per question of the topic) as well as
the most difficult. It means that developers frequently search for
customization solutions such as how to attach dynamic events to a form in
low-code UI, yet most (75.9%) of their questions remain without an accepted
answer. We manually label 900 questions from the posts to determine the
prevalence of the topics' challenges across LCSD phases. We find that most of

$c_{k-1}=J_{k-1}(+\infty)$, we conjecture that the function
$F:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R},$ given by $$F(a)= \sum_{k=1}^n 1_{a\in

this conjecture is ""the most optimistic possible"", and is equivalent to the
fact that for any symmetric convex set $K,$ its \emph{Gaussian concavity power}
$p^s(K,\gamma)$ is greater than or equal to $p_s(RB^k_2\times

information processing and quantum metrology. In particular, non-Gaussian
entangled states are predicted to achieve a higher sensitivity of precision
measurements than Gaussian states. On the basis of metrological sensitivity,
the conventional linear Ramsey squeezing parameter (RSP) efficiently
characterises the Gaussian entangled atomic states but fails for much wider
classes of highly sensitive non-Gaussian states. These complex non-Gaussian
entangled states can be classified by the nonlinear squeezing parameter (NLSP),
as a generalisation of the RSP with respect to nonlinear observables, and
identified via the Fisher information. However, the NLSP has never been
measured experimentally. Using a 19-qubit programmable superconducting
processor, here we report the characterisation of multiparticle entangled
states generated during its nonlinear dynamics. First, selecting 10 qubits, we
measure the RSP and the NLSP by single-shot readouts of collective spin
operators in several different directions. Then, by extracting the Fisher
information of the time-evolved state of all 19 qubits, we observe a large
metrological gain of 9.89$^{+0.28}_{-0.29}$ dB over the standard quantum limit,
indicating a high level of multiparticle entanglement for quantum-enhanced
phase sensitivity. Benefiting from high-fidelity full controls and addressable
single-shot readouts, the superconducting processor with interconnected qubits
provides an ideal platform for engineering and benchmarking non-Gaussian
entangled states that are useful for quantum-enhanced metrology.

investigating deeper in the direction towards Responsible and Explainable AI.
Among variety of applications of AI, facial expression recognition might not be
the most important one, yet is considered as a valuable part of human-AI
interaction. Evolution of facial expression recognition from the feature based
methods to deep learning drastically improve quality of such algorithms. This
research work aims to study a gender bias in deep learning methods for facial
expression recognition by investigating six distinct neural networks, training
them, and further analysed on the presence of bias, according to the three
definition of fairness. The main outcomes show which models are gender biased,
which are not and how gender of subject affects its emotion recognition. More
biased neural networks show bigger accuracy gap in emotion recognition between
male and female test sets. Furthermore, this trend keeps for true positive and
false positive rates. In addition, due to the nature of the research, we can
observe which types of emotions are better classified for men and which for
women. Since the topic of biases in facial expression recognition is not well
studied, a spectrum of continuation of this research is truly extensive, and

of technical debt. However, metrics generally need to be used with thresholds
as reference points that help to interpret their values properly and
objectively. The problem is that, while there are many proposed metrics, there
are relatively few studies on thresholds and threshold calculation methods;
hence, the effective application of metrics in practice has been limited.
Moreover, although it has been acknowledged that thresholds should not be
absolute, but rather relative to certain contextual factors, the context is
still not considered in most threshold studies. In this paper, the relationship
between system size (as a contextual factor) and metric thresholds is
investigated. The objective is to build predictive models that estimate
thresholds based solely on system size, and to assess the feasibility of this
approach as a threshold estimation method. An empirical study is conducted for
this purpose using 36 defect-prediction datasets and six metrics. The results
show that the proposed threshold estimation method is feasible, and it can
achieve an accuracy remarkably comparable to more complex threshold models.

engineering applications. It is diffcult to parallelize SpTRSV in today's
architectures. The limited parallelism due to the dependencies between
calculations and the irregular nature of the computations require an effective
load balancing and synchronization mechanism approach. In this work, we present
a novel graph transformation method where the equation representing a row is
rewritten to break the dependencies. Using this approach, we propose a
dependency graph transformation and code generation framework that increases
the parallelism of the parts of a sparse matrix where it is scarce, reducing
the need for synchronization points. In addition, the proposed framework
generates specialized code for the transformed dependency graph on CPUs using
domain-specific optimizations.

review process would involve a careful check of a piece of code in an attempt
to find defects and other quality issues/violations. One type of issues that
may impact the quality of the software is code smells - i.e., bad programming
practices that may lead to defects or maintenance issues. Yet, little is known
about the extent to which code smells are identified during code reviews. To
investigate the concept behind code smells identified in code reviews and what
actions reviewers suggest and developers take in response to the identified
smells, we conducted an empirical study of code smells in code reviews using
the two most active OpenStack projects (Nova and Neutron). We manually checked
19,146 review comments obtained by keywords search and random selection, and
got 1,190 smell-related reviews to study the causes of code smells and actions
taken against the identified smells. Our analysis found that 1) code smells
were not commonly identified in code reviews, 2) smells were usually caused by
violation of coding conventions, 3) reviewers usually provided constructive
feedback, including fixing (refactoring) recommendations to help developers
remove smells, and 4) developers generally followed those recommendations and
actioned the changes. Our results suggest that 1) developers should closely
follow coding conventions in their projects to avoid introducing code smells,
and 2) review-based detection of code smells is perceived to be a trustworthy
approach by developers, mainly because reviews are context-sensitive (as
reviewers are more aware of the context of the code given that they are part of
the project's development team).

and a small number N (with 5 < N < 60) of cilia with length comparable to the
body radius, is investigated by mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations. A
metachronal wave is imposed for the cilia beat, for which the wave vector has
both a longitudinal and a latitudinal component. The dynamics and motion is
characterized by the swimming velocity, its variation over the beat cycle, the
spinning velocity around the main body axis, as well as the parameters of the
helical trajectory. Our simulation results show that the microswimmer motion
strongly depends on the latitudinal wave number and the longitudinal phase lag.
The microswimmers are found to swim smoothly and usually spin around their own
axis. Chirality of the metachronal beat pattern generically generates helical
trajectories. In most cases, the helices are thin and stretched, i.e. the helix
radius is about an order of magnitude smaller than the pitch. The rotational
diffusion of the microswimmer is significantly smaller than the passive
rotational diffusion of the body alone, which indicates that the extended cilia
contribute strongly to the hydrodynamic radius. The swimming velocity vswim is
found to increase with the cilia number N with a slightly sublinear power law,
consistent with the behavior expected from the dependence of the transport
velocity of planar cilia arrays on the cilia separation.

The main purpose of code summarization is to assist developers in understanding
code and to reduce documentation workload. In this paper, we design a novel
multi-task learning (MTL) approach for code summarization through mining the
relationship between method code summaries and method names. More specifically,
since a method's name can be considered as a shorter version of its code
summary, we first introduce the tasks of generation and informativeness
prediction of method names as two auxiliary training objectives for code
summarization. A novel two-pass deliberation mechanism is then incorporated
into our MTL architecture to generate more consistent intermediate states fed
into a summary decoder, especially when informative method names do not exist.
To evaluate our deliberation MTL approach, we carried out a large-scale
experiment on two existing datasets for Java and Python. The experiment results
show that our technique can be easily applied to many state-of-the-art neural
models for code summarization and improve their performance. Meanwhile, our
approach shows significant superiority when generating summaries for methods
with non-informative names.

conducted a field experiment with eight professional developers who used RAID

documenting refactorings in diffs, RAID reduces the number of lines required

a necessary primitive for many quantum communication applications. A large
range of schemes for realizing the long-distance delivery of remote
entanglement has been proposed, both for bipartite and multipartite
entanglement. For assessing the viability of these schemes, knowledge of the
time at which entanglement is delivered is crucial. Specifically, if the
communication task requires multiple remote-entangled quantum states and these
states are generated at different times by the scheme, the earlier states will
need to wait and thus their quality will decrease while being stored in an
(imperfect) memory. For the remote-entanglement delivery schemes which are
closest to experimental reach, this time assessment is challenging, as they
consist of nondeterministic components such as probabilistic entanglement
swaps. For many such protocols even the average time at which entanglement can
be distributed is not known exactly, in particular when they consist of
feedback loops and forced restarts. In this work, we provide improved
analytical bounds on the average and on the quantiles of the completion time of
entanglement distribution protocols in the case that all network components
have success probabilities lower bounded by a constant. A canonical example of
such a protocol is a nested quantum repeater scheme which consists of heralded
entanglement generation and entanglement swaps. For this scheme specifically,
our results imply that a common approximation to the mean entanglement
distribution time, the 3-over-2 formula, is in essence an upper bound to the
real time. Our results rely on a novel connection with reliability theory.

rates. To obtain additional prior knowledge we first study the feasible rate
region, i.e., the set of all vectors of user rates that can be supported by the

the existence of a Lipschitz function that maps feasible rate vectors to
cell-load vectors. With these results in hand, we present a learning technique

using prior knowledge and a small training sample set. Simulations in the

Existing computational solutions mostly focus on drawing unbiased maps by

fairness are orthogonal qualities, and introduce a scalable two-stage method to
explicitly optimize for arbitrary piecewise-linear definitions of fairness. The
first stage is a randomized divide-and-conquer column generation heuristic

the compositional structure of graph partitioning problems. This district
ensemble forms the input to a master selection problem to choose the districts

flexibility in defining fairness-aligned objective functions. The pipeline is
arbitrarily parallelizable, is flexible to support additional redistricting

visual interpretation methods are needed, but linguistic models are also
necessary to verbally describe the semantic relations. This problem is known as
Image Captioning. Although many datasets were proposed in the literature, the

Further, the captions in our dataset bring additional challenges to the

#PraCegoVer has only one reference to each image; also, both mean and variance
of our reference sentence length are significantly greater than those in the MS

pressures, hydrodynamic stresses cause particles to be continually deposited on

relative influence of erosion is suppressed, causing particles to localize near

gravitational lenses. In fact, the gravitational lens of the Sun is a
well-known astrophysical phenomenon predicted by Einstein's general theory of
relativity. It implies that, if we can send a probe along any radial direction
away from the Sun up to the minimal distance of 550 AU and beyond, the Sun's
mass will act as a huge magnifying lens, letting us ""see"" detailed radio maps
of whatever may lie on the other side of the Sun even at very large distances.
The 2009 book by this author, ref. [1], studies such future FOCAL space
missions to 550 AU and beyond. In this paper, however, we want to study another
possibility yet: how to create the future interstellar radio links between the
solar system and any future interstellar probe by utilizing the gravitational
lens of the Sun as a huge antenna. In particular, we study the Bit Error Rate
(BER) across interstellar distances with and without using the gravitational
lens effect of the Sun (ref. [2]). The conclusion is that only when we will
exploit the Sun as a gravitational lens we will be able to communicate with our
own probes (or with nearby Aliens) across the distances of even the nearest
stars to us in the Galaxy, and that at a reasonable Bit Error Rate. We also
study the radio bridge between the Sun and any other Star that is made up by
the two gravitational lenses of both the Sun and that Star. The alignment for
this radio bridge to work is very strict, but the power-saving is enormous, due
to the huge contributions of the two stars' lenses to the overall antenna gain
of the system. We study a few cases in detail. Finally, we find the information
channel capacity for each of those radio bridges, putting thus a physical
constraint to the amount of information transfer that will be possible even by
exploiting the stars as gravitational lenses

field of solar magnetism. We study the effects that destabilise and stabilise
the flux tube of a simulated sunspot in the upper convection zone. The
depth-varying effects of fluting instability, buoyancy forces, and timescales
on the flux tube are analysed. The simulation was calculated with the MURaM
code. The domain has a lateral extension of 98 Mm x 98 Mm and extends almost 18
Mm below the solar surface. The analysed data set of 30 hours shows a stable
sunspot at the solar surface. We studied the evolution of the flux tube at
horizontal layers by means of the relative change in perimeter and area with a
linear stability analysis. We find a corrugation along the perimeter of the
flux tube that proceeds fastest at a depth of about 8 Mm below the surface.
Towards the surface and towards deeper layers, the decrease in compactness is
damped. From the stability analysis, we find that above a depth of 2 Mm, the
sunspot is stabilised by buoyancy forces. The spot is least stable at a depth
of about 3 Mm because of fluting instability. The stability of the sunspot at
the surface affects the behaviour of the field lines in deeper layers by
magnetic tension. Therefore the fluting instability is damped at depths of
about 3 Mm, and the decrease in compactness is strongest at a depth of about 8
Mm. The more vertical orientation of the magnetic field and the longer
convective timescale slow down the corrugation process in layers deeper than 10
Mm. The formation of large intrusions of field-free plasma below the surface
destabilises the sunspot, and eventually lead to the disruption and decay of
the sunspot. This process is not visible at the surface, where the sunspot is
stabilised by buoyancy forces. The onset of sunspot decay occurs in deeper
layers, while the sunspot still appears stable in the photosphere.

a user that can select one of two possible outcomes (e.g., `click' vs
`no-click'). Despite remarkable recent progress and improved algorithms for
logistic bandits, existing works do not address practical situations where the
number of outcomes that can be selected by the user is larger than two (e.g.,
`click', `show me later', `never show again', `no click'). In this paper, we
study such an extension. We use multinomial logit (MNL) to model the
probability of each one of $K+1\geq 2$ possible outcomes (+1 stands for the
`not click' outcome): we assume that for a learner's action $\mathbf{x}_t$, the
user selects one of $K+1\geq 2$ outcomes, say outcome $i$, with a multinomial
logit (MNL) probabilistic model with corresponding unknown parameter
$\bar{\boldsymbol\theta}_{\ast i}$. Each outcome $i$ is also associated with a

indicate that the SM has to be modified. One of the possible ways to extend the
SM is to introduce heavy neutral leptons (HNLs). To search for HNLs in
intensity frontier experiments, one has to consider HNL production both in
2-body and 3-body decays of some mesons. We verified the possibility of using
the parton level PYTHIA default matrix elements (without the form-factor
formalism) to calculate HNL production in 3-body semileptonic decays of $B$ and
$D$ mesons in the experimentally interesting mass range of the produced HNLs.
We conclude that this approach is quite suitable for the estimation of the
sensitivity region for HNLs in the intensity frontier experiments, provided one
uses suitable parton level PYTHIA default matrix elements. Our study was driven
by the usage of such an approximation by the SHiP collaboration. We conclude
that in this case the parton level PYTHIA default matrix elements could have

Metastability is induced in the low temperature phase through an instantaneous

depth is adjusted, depending on the value of temperature $T$, interaction range
$R$, and number of states $q$, in such a way that a constant nucleation time is

compact droplet regime occurring in presence of short range interactions $R

are influenced by the presence of a mean-field spinodal singularity. We
evaluate the metastable susceptibility of the order parameter as well as
various critical droplet properties, which along with the evolution of the
quench depth as a function of $q,T$ and $R$, are then compared with the field
theoretical predictions valid in the large $R$ limit in order to find the onset
of spinodal-assisted nucleation. We find that, with a mild dependence on the

time-consuming. In this paper, we present a majorization-minimization (MM)
based 1bRELAX algorithm, referred to as 1bMMRELAX, to enhance the computational
efficiency of 1bRELAX. Using the MM technique, 1bMMRELAX maximizes the
likelihood function iteratively using simple FFT operations instead of the more
computationally intensive search used by 1bRELAX. Both simulated and

reduce the computational cost of 1bRELAX while maintaining its excellent

supports the formation of multiple quantum phases, as possible instabilities of
the Superconductor-Insulator Transition (SIT) at a singular quantum critical
point. We explore a one-dimensional model which exhibits such variety of phases
in the strongly quantum fluctuations regime. Specifically, we study the effect
of weak disorder on a two-leg Josephson ladder with comparable Josephson and
charging energies ($E_J$~$E_C$). An additional key feature of our model is the
requirement of perfect $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry, respected by all parameters
including the disorder. Using a perturbative renormalization-group (RG)
analysis, we derive the phase diagram and identify at least one intermediate
phase between a full-fledged superconductor and a disorder-dominated insulator.
Most prominently, for repulsive interactions on the rungs we identify two
distinct mixed phases: in both of them the longitudinal charge mode is a
gapless superconductor, however one phase exhibits a dipolar charge density
order on the rungs, while the other is disordered. This latter phase is
characterized by coexisting superconducting (phase-locked) and charge-ordered
rungs, and encompasses the potential of evolving into a Griffith's phase
characteristic of the random-field Ising model in the strong disorder limit.

We found that, if the inner shell of HuBi1 was formed by an explosive very late
thermal pulse (VLTP) ejecting material with velocities of $\sim$300 km
s$^{-1}$, the age of this structure is consistent with that of $\simeq$200 yr
derived from multi-epoch narrow-band imaging. Our simulations predict that, as
a consequence of the dramatic reduction of the stellar wind velocity and photon
ionizing flux during the VLTP, the velocity and pressure structure of the outer
H-rich nebula are affected creating turbulent ionized structures surrounding
the inner shell. These are indeed detected in Gran Telescopio Canarias MEGARA
optical observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the current relatively
low ionizing photon flux from the central star of HuBi1 is not able to
completely ionize the inner shell, which favors previous suggestions that its
excitation is dominated by shocks. Our simulations suggest that the kinetic
energy of the H-poor ejecta of HuBi1 is at least 30 times that of the clumps

requires an industry-oriented paradigm which differs significantly from the

integrator on the recently established NIST assembly benchmark. We explain the
design choices, representing several years of investigation, which enabled our
DRL system to consistently outperform the integrator baseline in terms of both
speed and reliability. Finally, we conclude with a competition between our DRL

assumption does not hold in real-world applications where the outlierness of
different entities is dependent on each other and/or taken from different
probability distributions (non-IID). This may lead to the failure of detecting
important outliers that are too subtle to be identified without considering the
non-IID nature. The issue is even intensified in more challenging contexts,
e.g., high-dimensional data with many noisy features. This work introduces a
novel outlier detection framework and its two instances to identify outliers in
categorical data by capturing non-IID outlier factors. Our approach first
defines and incorporates distribution-sensitive outlier factors and their
interdependence into a value-value graph-based representation. It then models
an outlierness propagation process in the value graph to learn the outlierness
of feature values. The learned value outlierness allows for either direct
outlier detection or outlying feature selection. The graph representation and
mining approach is employed here to well capture the rich non-IID
characteristics. Our empirical results on 15 real-world data sets with
different levels of data complexities show that (i) the proposed outlier
detection methods significantly outperform five state-of-the-art methods at the

significantly outperform three competing methods in enabling subsequent outlier

black-box based machine learning (ML) approach used in these HMDs fail to
address the uncertain predictions, including those made on zero-day malware.
The ML models used in HMDs are agnostic to the uncertainty that determines
whether the model ""knows what it knows,"" severely undermining its
trustworthiness. We propose an ensemble-based approach that quantifies
uncertainty in predictions made by ML models of an HMD, when it encounters an
unknown workload than the ones it was trained on. We test our approach on two
different HMDs that have been proposed in the literature. We show that the
proposed uncertainty estimator can detect >90% of unknown workloads for the
Power-management based HMD, and conclude that the overlapping benign and
malware classes undermine the trustworthiness of the Performance Counter-based
HMD.

  re-identification","Published on IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Person Re-Identification (ReID) across non-overlapping cameras is a
challenging task and, for this reason, most works in the prior art rely on
supervised feature learning from a labeled dataset to match the same person in
different views. However, it demands the time-consuming task of labeling the
acquired data, prohibiting its fast deployment, specially in forensic
scenarios. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) emerges as a promising
alternative, as it performs feature-learning adaptation from a model trained on
a source to a target domain without identity-label annotation. However, most
UDA-based algorithms rely upon a complex loss function with several
hyper-parameters, which hinders the generalization to different scenarios.
Moreover, as UDA depends on the translation between domains, it is important to
select the most reliable data from the unseen domain, thus avoiding error
propagation caused by noisy examples on the target data -- an often overlooked
problem. In this sense, we propose a novel UDA-based ReID method that optimizes
a simple loss function with only one hyper-parameter and that takes advantage
of triplets of samples created by a new offline strategy based on the diversity
of cameras within a cluster. This new strategy adapts the model and also
regularizes it, avoiding overfitting on the target domain. We also introduce a
new self-ensembling strategy, in which weights from different iterations are
aggregated to create a final model combining knowledge from distinct moments of
the adaptation. For evaluation, we consider three well-known deep learning
architectures and combine them for final decision-making. The proposed method
does not use person re-ranking nor any label on the target domain, and
outperforms the state of the art, with a much simpler setup, on the Market to
Duke, the challenging Market1501 to MSMT17, and Duke to MSMT17 adaptation
scenarios.

adversarial examples that induce desired misclassifications in the models. Such
risks impede the application of machine learning in security-sensitive domains.
Several defense methods have been proposed against adversarial attacks to
detect adversarial examples at test time or to make machine learning models
more robust. However, while existing methods are quite effective under blackbox
threat model, where the attacker is not aware of the defense, they are
relatively ineffective under whitebox threat model, where the attacker has full
knowledge of the defense.
  In this paper, we propose ExAD, a framework to detect adversarial examples
using an ensemble of explanation techniques. Each explanation technique in ExAD
produces an explanation map identifying the relevance of input variables for
the model's classification. For every class in a dataset, the system includes a
detector network, corresponding to each explanation technique, which is trained
to distinguish between normal and abnormal explanation maps. At test time, if
the explanation map of an input is detected as abnormal by any detector model
of the classified class, then we consider the input to be an adversarial
example. We evaluate our approach using six state-of-the-art adversarial
attacks on three image datasets. Our extensive evaluation shows that our
mechanism can effectively detect these attacks under blackbox threat model with
limited false-positives. Furthermore, we find that our approach achieves
promising results in limiting the success rate of whitebox attacks.

Polynomial
graph filters (PGFs), defined as polynomials of a fundamental graph operator,
can be implemented in the vertex domain, and usually have a lower complexity
than frequency domain filter implementations. In this paper, we focus on the
design of filters for graphs with graph Fourier transform (GFT) corresponding
to a discrete trigonometric transform (DTT), i.e., one of 8 types of discrete
cosine transforms (DCT) and 8 discrete sine transforms (DST). In this case, we
show that multiple sparse graph operators can be identified, which allows us to
propose a generalization of PGF design: multivariate polynomial graph filter
(MPGF). First, for the widely used DCT-II (type-2 DCT), we characterize a set
of sparse graph operators that share the DCT-II matrix as their common
eigenvector matrix. This set contains the well-known connected line graph.
These sparse operators can be viewed as graph filters operating in the DCT
domain, which allows us to approximate any DCT graph filter by a MPGF, leading
to a design with more degrees of freedom than the conventional PGF approach.
Then, we extend those results to all of the 16 DTTs as well as their 2D
versions, and show how their associated sets of multiple graph operators can be
determined. We demonstrate experimentally that ideal low-pass and exponential
DCT/DST filters can be approximated with higher accuracy with similar runtime
complexity. Finally, we apply our method to transform-type selection in a video
codec, AV1, where we demonstrate significant encoding time savings, with a
negligible compression loss.

highlighted, which aids effectively in exploring data structures. We further
enhance PDE, referring to it as PDE+, by incorporating kriging to estimate the
random effects not explained in the mean functions. Our proposal can not only

  Phase-Contrast Imaging","31 pages, 10 figures",,"10.1002/mp.15189",,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Purpose: Grating-based imaging (GBI) and edge-illumination (EI) are two
promising types of XPCI as the conventional x-ray sources can be directly
utilized. For GBI and EI systems, the phase-stepping acquisition with multiple
exposures at a constant fluence is usually adopted in the literature. This
work, however, attempts to challenge such a constant fluence concept during the
phase-stepping process and proposes a fluence adaptation mechanism for dose
reduction. Method: Recently, analytic multi-order moment analysis has been
proposed to improve the computing efficiency. In these algorithms, multiple
contrasts can be calculated by summing together the weighted phase-stepping
curves (PSCs) with some kernel functions, which suggests us that the raw data
at different steps have different contributions for the noise in retrieved
contrasts. Based on analytic retrieval formulas and the Gaussian noise model
for detected signals, we derived an optimal adaptive fluence distribution,
which is proportional to the absolute weighting kernel functions and the root
of original sample PSCs acquired under the constant fluence. Results: To
validate our analyses, simulations and experiments are conducted for GBI and EI
systems. Simulated results demonstrate that the dose reduction ratio between
our proposed fluence distributions and the typical constant one can be about
20% for the phase contrast, which is consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Although the experimental noise reduction ratios are a little
smaller than the theoretical ones, synthetic and real experiments both observe
better noise performance by our proposed method. Our simulated results also
give out the effective ranges of the parameters of the PSCs, such as the
visibility in GBI, the standard deviation and the mean value in EI, providing a
guidance for the use of our proposed approach in practice.

resource management mechanisms play a fundamental role. In particular,
scheduling should receive much attention, because it allocates radio resources
among different users in terms of their channel conditions and QoS
requirements. The difficulties of scheduling algorithms are the tradeoffs need
to be made among multiple objectives, such as throughput, fairness and packet
drop rate. We propose a smart scheduling scheme based on deep reinforcement
learning (DRL). We not only verify the performance gain achieved, but also
provide implementation-friend designs, i.e., a scalable neural network design
for the agent and a virtual environment training framework. With the scalable
neural network design, the DRL agent can easily handle the cases when the
number of active users is time-varying without the need to redesign and retrain
the DRL agent. Training the DRL agent in a virtual environment offline first
and using it as the initial version in the practical usage helps to prevent the
system from suffering from performance and robustness degradation due to the
time-consuming training. Through both simulations and field tests, we show that
the DRL-based smart scheduling outperforms the conventional scheduling method
and can be adopted in practical systems.

real-time testbed for evaluating two modes of cross-domain integration -
subject area exploration via expansive learning and cross-disciplinary
collaboration among domain experts. We show that research involving both modes
features a 16% citation premium relative to a mono-disciplinary baseline.
Further comparison of research integrating neighboring versus distant research
domains shows that the cross-disciplinary mode is essential for integrating
across relatively large disciplinary distances. Yet we find research utilizing
cross-domain subject area exploration alone - a convergence shortcut - to be
growing in prevalence at roughly 3% per year, significantly faster than the
alternative cross-disciplinary mode, despite being less effective at
integrating domains and markedly less impactful. By measuring shifts in the
prevalence and impact of different convergence modes in the 5-year intervals

patterns may relate to competitive pressures associated with global Human Brain
flagship funding initiatives. Without additional policy guidance, such Grand

thereby undercutting the advantages of cross-disciplinary teams in tackling
challenges calling on convergence.

list contains the transmitted message, secure list decoding requires the
following additional security conditions to work as a modification of
bit-string commitment. The first additional security condition is the
receiver's uncertainty for the transmitted message, which is stronger than the
impossibility of the correct decoding, even though the transmitted message is
contained in the list. The other additional security condition is the
impossibility for the sender to estimate another element of the decoded list
except for the transmitted message. The first condition is evaluated by the
equivocation rate. The asymptotic property is evaluated by three parameters,
the rates of the message and list sizes, and the equivocation rate. We derive
the capacity region of this problem. We show that the combination of hash
function and secure list decoding yields the conventional bit-string
commitment. Our results hold even when the input and output systems are general
probability spaces including continuous systems. When the input system is a
general probability space, we formulate the abilities of the honest sender and
the dishonest sender in a different way.

stellar dynamics in the Solar Neighborhood (SN). All our results presented here
rely on: 1) observational evidence that the Sun lies near the corotation
circle, where stars rotate with the same angular velocity as the spiral-arm
pattern; the corotation circle establishes domains of the corotation resonance
(CR) in the Galactic disk; 2) dynamical constraints that put the spiral-arm
potential as the dominant perturbation in the SN, comparing with the effects of
the central bar in the SN; 3) a long-lived nature of the spiral structure,
promoting a state of dynamical relaxing and phase-mixing of the stellar orbits
in response to the spiral perturbation. With an analytical model for the
Galactic potential, composed of an axisymmetric background deduced from the
observed rotation curve, and perturbed by a four-armed spiral pattern,
numerical simulations of stellar orbits are performed to delineate the domains
of regular and chaotic motions shaped by the resonances. Such studies show that
stars can be trapped inside the stable zones of the spiral CR, and this orbital
trapping mechanism could explain the dynamical origin of the Local arm of the
Milky Way (MW). The spiral CR and the near high-order epicyclic resonances
influence the velocity distribution in the SN, creating the observable
structures such as moving groups and their radially extended counterpart known
as diagonal ridges. The Sun and most of the SN stars evolve inside a stable
zone of the spiral CR, never crossing the main spiral-arm structure, but
oscillating in the region between the Sagittarius-Carina and Perseus arms. This
orbital behavior of the Sun brings insights to our understanding of questions
concerning the solar system evolution, the Earth environment changes, and the
preservation of life on Earth.

federated learning (AirFL) system, where an intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS) is deployed to assist the transmission from users to the base station
(BS). With the purpose of overcoming the absence of the security examination
against malicious individuals, successive interference cancellation (SIC) is
adopted as a basis to support analyzing statistic characteristics of model
parameters from devices. The objective of this paper is to minimize the
mean-square-error by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming vector at the
BS, transmit power allocation at users, and phase shift matrix of the IRS,
subject to the transmit power constraint for devices, unit-modulus constraint
for reflecting elements, SIC decoding order constraint and quality-of-service
constraint. To address this complicated problem, alternating optimization is
employed to decompose it into three subproblems, where the optimal receive
beamforming vector is obtained by solving the first subproblem with the
Lagrange dual method. Then, the convex relaxation method is applied to the
transmit power allocation subproblem to find a suboptimal solution. Eventually,
the phase shift matrix subproblem is addressed by invoking the semidefinite
relaxation. Simulation results validate the availability of IRS and the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving federated learning
performance.

developmental tree. To compare developmental trees of different species, we
need to define distances on trees. If children cells after a division are not
distinguishable, developmental trees are represented by the space $\mathcal{T}$
of rooted trees with possibly repeated labels, where all vertices are
unordered. If children cells after a division are partially distinguishable,
developmental trees are represented by the space $\mathcal{P}$ of rooted trees
with possibly repeated labels, where vertices can be ordered or unordered. On
$\mathcal{T}$, the space of rooted unordered trees with possibly repeated
labels, we define two metrics: the best-match metric and the left-regular
metric, which show some advantages over existing methods. On $\mathcal{P}$, the
space of rooted labeled trees with ordered or unordered vertices, there is no
metric, and we define a semimetric, which is a variant of the best-match
metric. To compute the best-match distance between two trees, the expected time
complexity and worst-case time complexity are both $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, where
$n$ is the tree size. To compute the left-regular distance between two trees,
the expected time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n)$, and the worst-case time
complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$. For rooted labeled trees with
(fully/partially) unordered vertices, we define metrics (semimetric) that have
fast algorithms to compute and have advantages over existing methods. Such
trees also appear outside of developmental biology, and such metrics can be
applied to other types of trees which have more extensive applications,
especially in molecular biology.

Specifically, by developing a dynamic unfolding strategy, our model enjoys the
adaptability of handling CS problems with different ratios, i.e., multi-ratio

reduce blocking artifacts and enhance the CS recovery quality. Furthermore, we
adopt a balanced dataset for training, which brings more robustness when
reconstructing images of multiple scenes. Extensive experiments on four

GKP states interface so well with CVCSs? To answer this question, we apply the
recently introduced subsystem decomposition of a bosonic mode, which divides a
mode into logical and gauge-mode subsystems, to three types of cluster state:
CVCSs, GKP cluster states, and hybrid CV-GKP cluster states. We find that each

quantum computing. To complement the analytical approach, we introduce a simple

how the hidden qubit cluster states are entangled with the gauge modes, and we
outline how these results would extend to the case of finitely squeezed states.
This work provides important insight that is both conceptually satisfying and
helps to address important practical issues like when a simpler resource (such
as a Gaussian state) can stand in for a more complex one (like a GKP state),

preference, different from time-consistent preference, assumes that decision
makers prefer recent returns rather than future returns. Based on venture
capitalists' understanding of future preferences, we consider four types of
venture capitalists, namely time-consistent venture capitalists, venture
capitalists who only realize critical time point inconsistency, naive venture
capitalists and sophisticated venture capitalists, of which the latter three
are time-inconsistent. All types of time-inconsistent venture capitalists are
aware of critical time point inconsistency. Naive venture capitalists
misunderstand time flow inconsistency while sophisticated ones understand it
correctly. We propose an optimal exit timing of venture capital model. Then we
derive and compare the above four types of venture capitalists' exit
thresholds. The main results are as follows: (1) all types of time-inconsistent
venture capitalists tend to exit earlier than time-consistent venture
capitalists. (2) The longer the expire date are, the more likely venture
capitalists are to delay the exit, but the delay degree decreases successively
(venture capitalists who only realize critical time point inconsistency > naive

this question by designing ENIAC, an actor-critic method that allows non-linear

e.g., a bounded eluder dimension $d$ for the critic class, the learner finds a
near-optimal policy in $O(\poly(d))$ exploration rounds. The method is robust
to model misspecification and strictly extends existing works on linear

show that it outperforms prior heuristics inspired by linear methods,
establishing the value via correctly reasoning about the agent's uncertainty

of complex models for the interactions amongst the agents. While building
accurate models of these interactions could become prohibitive in many
applications, data-driven control methods can circumvent model complexities by
directly synthesizing a controller from the observed data. In this paper, we
propose the Data-Driven Distributed Policy Iteration (D3PI) algorithm to design
a feedback mechanism for a potentially large system that enjoys an underlying
graph structure characterizing communications among the agents. Rather than
having access to system parameters, our algorithm requires temporary
""auxiliary"" links to boost information exchange of a small portion of the graph
during the learning phase. Therein, the costs are partitioned for learning and
non-learning agents in order to ensure consistent control of the entire
network. After the termination of the learning process, a distributed policy is
proposed for the entire networked system by leveraging estimated components
obtained in the learning phase. We provide extensive stability and convergence
guarantees of the proposed distributed controller throughout the learning phase
by exploiting the structure of the system parameters that occur due to the
graph topology and existence of the temporary links. The practicality of our
method is then illustrated with a simulation.

latter is endowed with the structure of a K\""ahler manifold inherited from the
one of the space of quantum states. If the quantum volume of the twist-angle
torus is minimal, then both parameter spaces have the structure of a K\""ahler

protection against spectral leakage. Thomson's multitaper method is widely used
in applications, but most of the existing theory is qualitative or asymptotic.
Furthermore, many practitioners use a DPSS bandwidth $W$ and number of tapers
that are smaller than what the theory suggests is optimal because the
computational requirements increase with the number of tapers. We revisit
Thomson's multitaper method from a linear algebra perspective involving
subspace projections. This provides additional insight and helps us establish
nonasymptotic bounds on some statistical properties of the multitaper spectral
estimate, which are similar to existing asymptotic results. We show using
$K=2NW-O(\log(NW))$ tapers instead of the traditional $2NW-O(1)$ tapers better
protects against spectral leakage, especially when the power spectrum has a
high dynamic range. Our perspective also allows us to derive an
$\epsilon$-approximation to the multitaper spectral estimate which can be
evaluated on a grid of frequencies using $O(\log(NW)\log\tfrac{1}{\epsilon})$
FFTs instead of $K=O(NW)$ FFTs. This is useful in problems where many samples

promise for future semiconductor optoelectronics due to their unique electronic
and optical properties. In particular, electron-hole pairs (excitons) in TMDCs
are stable at room temperature and interact strongly with light. When TMDCs are
embedded in an optical microcavity, the excitons can hybridise with cavity
photons to form exciton polaritons (polaritons herein), which display both
ultrafast velocities and strong interactions. The ability to manipulate and
trap polaritons on a microchip is critical for future applications. Here, we
create a potential landscape for room-temperature polaritons in monolayer
WS$_2$, and demonstrate their free propagation and trapping. We show that the
effect of dielectric disorder, which restricts the diffusion of WS$_2$ excitons
and broadens their spectral resonance, is dramatically reduced in the strong
exciton-photon coupling regime leading to motional narrowing. This enables the
ballistic transport of WS$_2$ polaritons across tens of micrometers with an
extended range of partial first-order coherence. Moreover, the dephasing of
trapped polaritons is dramatically suppressed compared to both WS$_2$ excitons
and free polaritons. Our results demonstrate the possibility of long-range
transport and efficient trapping of TMDC polaritons in ambient conditions.

extensively in image classification but much less in image segmentation. So
far, our understanding of the learning behavior of DNNs trained by noisy
segmentation labels remains limited. In this study, we address this deficiency
in both binary segmentation of biological microscopy images and multi-class
segmentation of natural images. We generate extremely noisy labels by randomly
sampling a small fraction (e.g., 10%) or flipping a large fraction (e.g., 90%)
of the ground truth labels. When trained with these noisy labels, DNNs provide
largely the same segmentation performance as trained by the original ground
truth. This indicates that DNNs learn structures hidden in labels rather than
pixel-level labels per se in their supervised training for semantic
segmentation. We refer to these hidden structures in labels as meta-structures.
When DNNs are trained by labels with different perturbations to the
meta-structure, we find consistent degradation in their segmentation
performance. In contrast, incorporation of meta-structure information
substantially improves performance of an unsupervised segmentation model
developed for binary semantic segmentation. We define meta-structures
mathematically as spatial density distributions and show both theoretically and

``teacher forcing'' takes the ground truth as input at each time step and makes
the later predictions partly conditioned on those inputs. Such training
strategy impairs their ability to learn rich distributions over entire
sequences because the chosen inputs hinders the gradients back-propagating to
all previous states in an end-to-end manner. We propose a fully differentiable
training algorithm for RNNs to better capture long-term dependencies by
recovering the probability of the whole sequence. The key idea is that at each
time step, the network takes as input a ``bundle'' of similar words predicted
at the previous step instead of a single ground truth. The representations of
these similar words forms a convex hull, which can be taken as a kind of
regularization to the input. Smoothing the inputs by this way makes the whole
process trainable and differentiable. This design makes it possible for the
model to explore more feasible combinations (possibly unseen sequences), and
can be interpreted as a computationally efficient approximation to the beam

  Our proof follows a random-walk approach, analyzing the contribution of a
random path in the decision tree to the level-$\ell$ Fourier expression. To
carry the argument, we apply a careful cleanup procedure to the parity decision
tree, ensuring that the value of the random walk is bounded with high

any local Markov chain on a discrete product space implies rapid mixing of the
Glauber dynamics in a blackbox fashion. More specifically, we only require the
expected distance between successive iterates under the coupling to be
summable, as opposed to being one-step contractive in the worst case. Combined
with recent local-to-global arguments \cite{CLV21}, we establish asymptotically
optimal lower bounds on the standard and modified log-Sobolev constants for the
Glauber dynamics for sampling from spin systems on bounded-degree graphs when a
curvature condition \cite{Oll09} is satisfied. To achieve this, we use Stein's
method for Markov chains \cite{BN19, RR19} to show that a ""good"" coupling for a
local Markov chain yields strong bounds on the spectral independence of the
distribution in the sense of \cite{ALO20}.
  Our primary application is to sampling proper list-colorings on
bounded-degree graphs. In particular, combining the coupling for the flip
dynamics given by \cite{Vig00, CDMPP19} with our techniques, we show optimal
$O(n\log n)$ mixing for the Glauber dynamics for sampling proper list-colorings
on any bounded-degree graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ whenever the size of
the color lists are at least $\left(\frac{11}{6} - \epsilon\right)\Delta$,
where $\epsilon \approx 10^{-5}$ is small constant. While $O(n^{2})$ mixing was
already known before, our approach additionally yields Chernoff-type
concentration bounds for Hamming Lipschitz functions in this regime, which was
not known before. Our approach is markedly different from prior works
establishing spectral independence for spin systems using spatial mixing
\cite{ALO20, CLV20, CGSV20, FGYZ20}, which crucially is still open in this

of extracting source code from programming screencasts. First, psc2code
leverages the Convolutional Neural Network based image classification to remove
non-code and noisy-code frames. Then, psc2code performs edge detection and
clustering-based image segmentation to detect sub-windows in a code frame, and
based on the detected sub-windows, it identifies and crops the screen region
that is most likely to be a code editor. Finally, psc2code calls the API of a
professional OCR tool to extract source code from the cropped code regions and
leverages the OCRed cross-frame information in the programming screencast and
the statistical language model of a large corpus of source code to correct
errors in the OCRed source code.
  We conduct an experiment on 1,142 programming screencasts from YouTube. We
find that our CNN-based image classification technique can effectively remove
the non-code and noisy-code frames, which achieves an F1-score of 0.95 on the
valid code frames. Based on the source code denoised by psc2code, we implement
two applications: 1) a programming screencast search engine; 2) an
interaction-enhanced programming screencast watching tool. Based on the source
code extracted from the 1,142 collected programming screencasts, our
experiments show that our programming screencast search engine achieves the
precision@5, 10, and 20 of 0.93, 0.81, and 0.63, respectively.

drawn from a native gate alphabet, which is functionally equivalent to the
target unitary U. It is a crucial stage for the running of quantum algorithms
on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the space for
structure exploration of quantum circuit is enormous, resulting in the
requirement of human expertise, hundreds of experimentations or modifications
from existing quantum circuits. In this paper, we propose a variational quantum
compiling (VQC) algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL), in order to
automatically design the structure of quantum circuit for VQC with no human
intervention. An agent is trained to sequentially select quantum gates from the
native gate alphabet and the qubits they act on by double Q-learning with
\epsilon-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. At first, the agent
randomly explores a number of quantum circuits with different structures, and
then iteratively discovers structures with higher performance on the learning
task. Simulation results show that the proposed method can make exact
compilations with less quantum gates compared to previous VQC algorithms. It
can reduce the errors of quantum algorithms due to decoherence process and gate
noise in NISQ devices, and enable quantum algorithms especially for complex
algorithms to be executed within coherence time.

quantum properties such as entanglement. This estimation usually consists of
three steps: state preparation, time evolution during which information of the
parameters is encoded in the state, and readout of the state. Decoherence
during the time evolution typically degrades the performance of quantum
metrology and is considered to be one of the major obstacles to realizing
entanglement-enhanced sensing. We show, however, that under suitable
conditions, this decoherence can be exploited to improve the sensitivity.
Assume that we have two axes, and our aim is to estimate the relative angle
between them. Our results reveal that the use of Markvoian collective dephasing
to estimate the relative angle between the two directions affords
Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. Moreover, our scheme based on Markvoian
collective dephasing is robust against environmental noise, and it is possible
to achieve the Heisenberg limit even under the effect of independent dephasing.
Our counterintuitive results showing that the sensitivity is improved by using
the decoherence pave the way to novel applications in quantum metrology.

locally unstable. The radial contribution in the corresponding Hamiltonian is
$\sim xp$ kind, where $p$ is the canonical momentum and $x$ is its conjugate

explained through this Hamiltonian when one dose a semi-classical analysis. It
again confirms that near horizon instability is liable for its own temperature

coded caching networks. Focusing on a fully-connected fully-interfering
wireless setting with multiple cache-enabled transmitters and receivers, we
show how non-uniform file popularity can be used very efficiently to accelerate
the impact of transmitter-side data redundancy on receiver-side coded caching.
This approach is motivated by the recent discovery that, under any realistic
file-size constraint, having content appear in multiple transmitters can in
fact dramatically boost the speed-up factor attributed to coded caching.
  We formulate an optimization problem that exploits file popularity to
optimize the placement of files at the transmitters. We then provide a proof
that reduces significantly the variable search space, and propose a new search
algorithm that solves the problem at hand. We also prove an analytical
performance upper bound, which is in fact met by our algorithm in the regime of
many receivers. Our work reflects the benefits of allocating higher cache
redundancy to more popular files, but also reflects a law of diminishing
returns where for example very popular files may in fact benefit from minimum
redundancy. In the end, this work reveals that in the context of coded caching,
employing multiple transmitters can be a catalyst in fully exploiting file
popularity, as it avoids various asymmetry complications that appear when file
popularity is used to alter the receiver-side cache placement.

of the approximation ratio of the returned results. To speed up query

evaluation cost. In addition, a theoretical analysis of the required sample

comprehensive experiments are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to

Fourier data is a fundamental problem in imaging and signal processing. With
the incomplete Fourier data and the inevitable noise in the measurement, there
is a fundamental limit on the separation distance between point sources that
can be resolved. This is the so-called resolution limit problem.
Characterization of this resolution limit is still a long-standing puzzle
despite the prevalent use of the classic Rayleigh limit. It is well-known that
Rayleigh limit is heuristic and its drawbacks become prominent when dealing
with data that is subjected to delicate processing, as is what modern
computational imaging methods do. Therefore, more precise characterization of
the resolution limit becomes increasingly necessary with the development of
data processing methods. For this purpose, we developed a theory of
""computational resolution limit"" for both number detection and support recovery
in one dimension in [arXiv:2003.02917[cs.IT], arXiv:1912.05430[eess.IV]]. In
this paper, we extend the one-dimensional theory to multi-dimensions. More
precisely, we define and quantitatively characterize the ""computational
resolution limit"" for the number detection and support recovery problems in a
general k-dimensional space. Our results indicate that there exists a phase
transition phenomenon regarding to the super-resolution factor and the
signal-to-noise ratio in each of the two recovery problems. Our main results
are derived using a subspace projection strategy. Finally, to verify the
theory, we proposed deterministic subspace projection based algorithms for the
number detection and support recovery problems in dimension two and three. The
numerical results confirm the phase transition phenomenon predicted by the
theory.

oriented object detection has received extensive attention in recent years. The
mainstream rotation detectors use oriented bounding boxes (OBB) or
quadrilateral bounding boxes (QBB) to represent the rotating objects. However,
these methods suffer from the representation ambiguity for oriented object
definition, which leads to suboptimal regression optimization and the
inconsistency between the loss metric and the localization accuracy of the
predictions. In this paper, we propose a Representation Invariance Loss (RIL)
to optimize the bounding box regression for the rotating objects. Specifically,
RIL treats multiple representations of an oriented object as multiple
equivalent local minima, and hence transforms bounding box regression into an
adaptive matching process with these local minima. Then, the Hungarian matching
algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal regression strategy. We also propose
a normalized rotation loss to alleviate the weak correlation between different
variables and their unbalanced loss contribution in OBB representation.
Extensive experiments on remote sensing datasets and scene text datasets show
that our method achieves consistent and substantial improvement. The source

of resistance stages that can withstand harsh environmental conditions for long
periods of time. At the community level, multiple species with such
long-lasting life stages can be more likely to coexist. While the implications
of this process for biodiversity have been studied in terrestrial plants, seed
banks are usually neglected in phytoplankton multispecies dynamic models, in
spite of widespread empirical evidence for such seed banks. In this study, we
build a metacommunity model of interacting phytoplankton species, including a
resting stage supplying the seed bank. The model is parameterized with
empirically-driven growth rate functions and field-based interaction estimates,
which include both facilitative and competitive interactions. Exchanges between
compartments (coastal pelagic cells, coastal resting cells on the seabed, and
open ocean pelagic cells) are controlled by hydrodynamical parameters to which
the sensitivity of the model is assessed. We consider two models, i.e., with
and without a saturating effect of the interactions on the growth rates. Our
results are consistent between models, and show that a seed bank allows to
maintain all species in the community over 30 years. Indeed, a fraction of the
species are vulnerable to extinction at specific times within the year, but
this process is buffered by their survival in their resting stage. We thus
highlight the potential role of the seed bank in the recurrent re-invasion of
the coastal community, and of coastal environments in re-seeding oceanic
regions. Moreover, the seed bank enables populations to tolerate stronger
interactions within the community as well as more severe changes to the
environment, such as those predicted in a climate change context. Our study
therefore shows how resting stages may help phytoplanktonic diversity
maintenance.

pore where the power of the oscillations in the umbra is not only comparable,

second and third layers actively re-plan and execute the path, exploiting the

two utility formulations to account for the presence of obstacles in the field

the formation of typical wave-like features, such as reflected, refracted and
transmitted waves (collectively, secondary waves). In accordance with these
observations, numerical evidence for the wave characteristics of CWs is given
by simulations which demonstrate effects of deflection and reflection when a CW
interacts with regions exhibiting a sudden density drop, such as CHs. However,
secondary waves are usually weak in their signal and simulations are limited in
the way the according idealisations have to be chosen. Hence, several
properties of the secondary waves during a CW-CH interaction are unclear or
ambiguous and might lead to misinterpretations. In this study we follow a
theoretical approach and focus in particular on the geometrical properties of
secondary waves caused by the interaction between oblique incoming CWs and CHs.
Based on a linear theory, we derive analytical expressions for reflection and
transmission coefficients, which tell us how strongly the amplitudes of the
secondary waves increase and decrease with respect to the incoming wave,
respectively. Additionally, we provide analytical terms for crucial incidence
angles that are capable of giving information about the energy flux, the phase
and the reflection properties of the secondary waves. These novel expressions
provide a supplementary tool for estimating CW properties in a fast and
straightforward way and, therefore, might have relevant consequences for a
possible new interpretation of already studied CW-CH interaction events and the
clarification of ambiguous observational data.

harbouring several ULXs. This new source underwent an outburst in 2012, when it

outburst reached a peak luminosity of 3.4$\times 10^{39}$ erg\ s$^{-1}$ and
lasted for about 8 months, after which the source went below a luminosity of
$10^{37}$ erg\ s$^{-1}$; previous \textit{Chandra} observations constrain the
low-state luminosity below $\sim$ 2$\times 10^{36}$ erg\ s$^{-1}$, implying a

counterparts, found in archival HST observations of the galaxy. A pulsation in
the \textit{XMM-Newton} signal was found at 2.52 Hz, with a significance of

deviation between the recorded color and intrinsic color, specular reflection
separation can bring advantages to multiple applications that require
consistent object surface appearance. However, due to the color of an object is
significantly influenced by the color of the illumination, the existing
researches still suffer from the near-duplicate challenge, that is, the
separation becomes unstable when the illumination color is close to the surface
color. In this paper, we derive a polarization guided model to incorporate the
polarization information into a designed iteration optimization separation
strategy to separate the specular reflection. Based on the analysis of
polarization, we propose a polarization guided model to generate a polarization
chromaticity image, which is able to reveal the geometrical profile of the
input image in complex scenarios, such as diversity of illumination. The
polarization chromaticity image can accurately cluster the pixels with similar
diffuse color. We further use the specular separation of all these clusters as
an implicit prior to ensure that the diffuse components will not be mistakenly
separated as the specular components. With the polarization guided model, we
reformulate the specular reflection separation into a unified optimization
function which can be solved by the ADMM strategy. The specular reflection will
be detected and separated jointly by RGB and polarimetric information. Both
qualitative and quantitative experimental results have shown that our method
can faithfully separate the specular reflection, especially in some challenging

pseudo-labels by measuring the feature similarity without considering the

computation across cameras. This paper targets to address this challenge by
studying a novel intra-inter camera similarity for pseudo-label generation. We
decompose the sample similarity computation into two stage, i.e., the
intra-camera and inter-camera computations, respectively. The intra-camera
computation directly leverages the CNN features for similarity computation
within each camera. Pseudo-labels generated on different cameras train the
re-id model in a multi-branch network. The second stage considers the
classification scores of each sample on different cameras as a new feature
vector. This new feature effectively alleviates the distribution discrepancy
among cameras and generates more reliable pseudo-labels. We hence train our
re-id model in two stages with intra-camera and inter-camera pseudo-labels,
respectively. This simple intra-inter camera similarity produces surprisingly
good performance on multiple datasets, e.g., achieves rank-1 accuracy of 89.5%
on the Market1501 dataset, outperforming the recent unsupervised works by 9+%,

received a lot of attention recently. The classical vertex arrival setting, for
which the celebrated Karp, Vazirani and Vazirani (KVV) algorithm achieves a
$1-1/e$ approximation, is rather well understood: the $1-1/e$ approximation is
optimal in both the online and semi-streaming setting, where the algorithm is
constrained to use $n\cdot \log^{O(1)} n$ space. The more challenging the edge
arrival model has seen significant progress recently in the online algorithms
literature. For the strictly online model (no preemption) approximations better
than trivial factor $1/2$ have been ruled out [Gamlath et al'FOCS'19]. For the
less restrictive online preemptive model a better than $\frac1{1+\ln
2}$-approximation [Epstein et al'STACS'12] and even a better than
$(2-\sqrt{2})$-approximation[Huang et al'SODA'19] have been ruled out.
  The recent hardness results for online preemptive matching in the edge
arrival model are based on the idea of stringing together multiple copies of a
KVV hard instance using edge arrivals. In this paper, we show how to implement
such constructions using ideas developed in the literature on Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi
graphs. As a result, we show that any single pass streaming algorithm that
approximates the maximum matching in a bipartite graph with $n$ vertices to a
factor better than $\frac1{1+\ln 2}\approx 0.59$ requires
$n^{1+\Omega(1/\log\log n)}\gg n \log^{O(1)} n$ space. This gives the first
separation between the classical one sided vertex arrival setting and the edge

bio-engineering tool to determine the metabolic concentrations, molecule
structures and so on. The data acquisition time, however, is very long in
multi-dimensional NMR. To accelerate data acquisition, non-uniformly sampling
is an effective way but may encounter severe spectral distortions and
unfaithful quantitative measures when the acceleration factor is high.
Objective: To reconstruct high fidelity spectra from highly accelerated NMR and
achieve much better quantitative measures. Methods: A virtual peak (VIP)
approach is proposed to self-learn the prior spectral information, such as the
central frequency and peak lineshape, and then feed these information into the
reconstruction. The proposed method is further implemented with cloud computing
to facilitate online, open, and easy access. Results: Results on synthetic and
experimental data demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art method,
the new approach provides much better reconstruction of low-intensity peaks and
significantly improves the quantitative measures, including the regression of
peak intensity, the distances between nuclear pairs, and concentrations of
metabolics in mixtures. Conclusion: Self-learning prior peak information can
improve the reconstruction and quantitative measures of spectra. Significance:
This approach enables highly accelerated NMR and may promote time-consuming
applications such as quantitative and time-resolved NMR experiments.

For
connected unweighted graphs, the mean distance can be defined as the arithmetic
mean of the distances between all pairs of vertices. This parameter provides a
natural measure of the compactness of the graph, and has been intensively
studied, together with several variants, including its version for weighted
graphs. The continuous analog of the (discrete) mean distance is the mean of
the distances between all pairs of points on the edges of the graph. Despite
being a very natural generalization, to the best of our knowledge this concept
has been barely studied, since the jump from discrete to continuous implies
having to deal with an infinite number of distances, something that increases
the difficulty of the parameter. In this paper we show that the continuous mean
distance of a weighted graph can be computed in time quadratic in the number of
edges, by two different methods that apply fundamental concepts in discrete
algorithms and computational geometry. We also present structural results that
allow a faster computation of this continuous parameter for several classes of
weighted graphs. Finally, we study the relation between the (discrete) mean
distance and its continuous counterpart, mainly focusing on the relevant
question of the convergence when iteratively subdividing the edges of the

various quality needs, and to improve development efficiency. In this context,
a change to such systems may need to modify source files written in different

development has not been explored yet. In light of the potential impact of
MPLCs on development difficulty and software quality, we performed an empirical
study to understand the state of MPLCs, their change complexity, as well as
their impact on open time of issues and bug proneness of source files in
real-life software projects. By exploring the MPLCs in 20 non-trivial Apache
projects with 205,994 commits, we obtained the following findings: (1) 9% of
the commits from all the projects are MPLCs, and the proportion of MPLCs in 80%
of the projects goes to a relatively stable level; (2) more than 90% of the
MPLCs from all the projects involve source files written in two PLs; (3) the
change complexity of MPLCs is significantly higher than that of non-MPLCs in
all projects; (4) issues fixed in MPLCs take significantly longer to be
resolved than issues fixed in non-MPLCs in 80% of the projects; and (5) source
files that have been modified in MPLCs tend to be more bug-prone than source
files that have never been modified in MPLCs. These findings provide
practitioners with useful insights on the architecture design and quality

ratchet device is set by moving particles driven by zero averages forces on
asymmetric potentials. Hybrid nanostructures combining artificially fabricated
spin-ice nanomagnet arrays with superconducting films have been identified as a
good choice to develop ratchet nanodevices. In our case, the asymmetric
potentials are provided by charged N\'eel walls located in the vertices of the
magnetic honeycomb array, whereas the role of moving particles is played by
superconducting vortices. We have experimentally obtained ratchet effect for
different spin ice I configurations and for vortex lattice moving parallel or
perpendicular to the magnetic easy axes. Remarkably, the ratchet magnitudes are
similar in all the experimental runs; i. e. different spin ice I configurations
and in both relevant directions of the vortex lattice motion. We have simulated
the interplay between vortex motion directions and a single asymmetric
potential. It turns out vortices interact with uneven asymmetric potentials,
when they move with trajectories crossing charged N\'eel walls with different
orientations. Moreover, the appropriate asymmetric pair potentials which
generate the local ratchet effect have been identified. In this rocking ratchet
the particles (vortices) on the move are interacting each other (vortex
lattice); therefore, the ratchet local effect turns into a global macroscopic
effect. In summary, this ratchet device benefits from interacting particles
moving in robust and topological protected type I spin ice landscapes.

We demonstrate the protocol in the microwave regime using donor spins in

lifetimes exceeding seconds, while the chirped pulse phase encoding could also
be applied in the optical regime to enhance quantum repeaters and networks.

with the general case in which a thin-shell separates the two spacetimes at the
separation hypersurface, for which the general junction conditions are deduced,
and the particular case for smooth matching is considered when the
stress-energy tensor of the thin-shell vanishes. The set of junction conditions
is similar to the one previously obtained for $f\left(R\right)$ gravity but
features also constraints in the continuity of the trace of the stress-energy
tensor $T_{ab}$ and its partial derivatives, which force the thin-shell to
satisfy the equation of state of radiation $\sigma=2p_t$. As a consequence, a
necessary and sufficient condition for spherically symmetric thin-shells to
satisfy all the energy conditions is the positivity of its energy density
$\sigma$. For specific forms of the function $f\left(R,T\right)$, the
continuity of $R$ and $T$ ceases to be mandatory but a gravitational
double-layer arises at the separation hypersurface. The Martinez thin-shell

the quantum quench scenario in which the initial state may be significantly

for sufficiently large tilt, $F$. In the latter case the dynamics seems to be
dominated by pair tunneling and the effective tunneling rate scales as $1/F^2$.
In the presence of an additional harmonic potential the imbalance is found to
be entirely determined by a local effective tilt, $F_{\text{loc}}$, the
entanglement entropy growth is modulated with frequency that follows
$1/F_{loc}^2$ scaling first but at long time the dynamics is determined rather
by the curvature of the harmonic potential. Only for large tilts or
sufficiently large curvatures, corresponding to the deeply localized regime, we
find the logarithmic entanglement growth for N\'eel initial state. The same
curvature determines long-time imbalance for large $F$ which reveals strong
revival phenomena associated with the manifold of equally spaced states,
degenerate in the absence of the harmonic potential.

triggers a severe accuracy drop because of its limited representation ability.
Since DNN models have been applied for relatively complex tasks (e.g.,
classification for large datasets and object detection), improvement in
accuracy for the PoT quantization method is required. Although some previous
works attempt to improve the accuracy of PoT quantization, there is no work
that balances accuracy and computation costs in a memory-efficient way. To
address this problem, we propose an efficient PoT quantization scheme.
Bit-level sparsity is introduced; weights (or activations) are rounded to
values that can be calculated by n shift operations in multiplication. We also
allow not only addition but also subtraction as each operation. Moreover, we
use a two-stage fine-tuning algorithm to recover the accuracy drop that is
triggered by introducing the bit-level sparsity. The experimental results on an
object detection model (CenterNet, MobileNet-v2 backbone) on the COCO dataset
show that our proposed method suppresses the accuracy drop by 0.3% at most

which study the sensitivities of outputs by perturbing inputs. Furthermore,
MACQ allows us to separate marginal attribution of individual features from

(UDM) are central but so far disconnected phenomena in femtomagnetism and
terahertz spintronics. Here, we use broadband terahertz emission spectroscopy
to reliably measure both processes in one setup. We find that the rate of UDM
of a single ferromagnetic metal film F has the same time evolution as the flux
of TST from F into an adjacent normal-metal layer N. This remarkable agreement
shows that UDM and TST are driven by the same force, which is fully determined
by the state of the ferromagnet. An analytical model consistently and
quantitatively explains our observations. It reveals that both UDM in F and TST
in the F|N stack arise from a generalized spin voltage, which is defined for
arbitrary, nonthermal electron distributions. We also conclude that
contributions due to a possible temperature difference between F and N are
minor and that the spin-current amplitude can, in principle, be increased by
one order of magnitude. In general, our findings allow one to apply the vast
knowledge of UDM to TST, thereby opening up new pathways toward large-amplitude
terahertz spin currents and, thus, energy-efficient ultrafast spintronic
devices.

other cancer. Brain surgery constitutes the first and decisive step for the
treatment of such tumors. It is extremely crucial to achieve complete tumor
resection during surgery, however, this is a highly challenging task, as it is
very difficult to visually differentiate tumorous cells from the surrounding
healthy white matter. The nerve fiber bundles constitutive of the white matter
are organized in such a way that they exhibit a certain degree of structural
anisotropy and birefringence. The birefringence exhibited by such aligned
fibrous tissue is known to be extremely sensitive to small pathological
alterations. Indeed, highly aligned anisotropic fibers exhibit higher
birefringence than structures with weaker alignment and anisotropy, such as
cancerous tissue. In this study, we performed experiments on thick coronal
slices of a healthy human brain to explore the possibility of (i) measuring,
with a polarimetric microscope (employed in the backscattering geometry to
facilitate non-invasive diagnostics), the birefringence exhibited by the white
matter and (ii) relating the measured birefringence to the fiber orientation
and the degree of alignment. This is done by analyzing the spatial distribution
of the degree of polarization of the backscattered light and its variation with
the polarization state of the probing beam. We demonstrate that polarimetry can
be used to reliably distinguish between white and gray matter in the brain,
which might help to intraoperatively delineate unstructured tumorous tissue and
well organized healthy brain tissue. In addition, we show that our technique is
able to sensitively reconstruct the local mean nerve fiber orientation in the
brain, which can help to guide tumor resections by identifying vital nerve
fiber trajectories thereby improving the outcome of the brain surgery.

of matter correspond to its deconfined phases, where the gauge field is
effectively noncompact, while conventional broken-symmetry phases are
associated with confinement triggered by the proliferation of
monopole-instantons. While much attention has been devoted lately to the
symmetry classification of monopole operators in massless CQED$_3$ and related
3D conformal field theories, explicit derivations of instanton dynamics in
parton gauge theories with fermions have been lacking. In this work, we use
semiclassical methods analogous to those used by 't Hooft in the solution of
the $U(1)$ problem in 4D quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to explicitly demonstrate
the symmetry-breaking effect of instantons in CQED$_3$ with massive fermions,
motivated by a fermionic parton description of hard-core bosons on a lattice.
By contrast with the massless case studied by Marston, we find that massive
fermions possess Euclidean zero modes exponentially localized to the center of
the instanton. Such Euclidean zero modes produce in turn an effective
four-fermion interaction -- known as the 't Hooft vertex in QCD -- which
naturally leads to two possible superfluid phases for the original microscopic
bosons: a conventional single-particle condensate or an exotic boson pair
condensate without single-particle condensation.

differential equations (PDEs). When the aim is to solve such PDEs for a large
number of parameter values, Reduced Basis Methods (RBM) are often used to
reduce computational costs of a classical high fidelity code based on Finite
Element Method (FEM), Finite Volume (FVM) or Spectral methods. The efficient
implementation of most of these RBM requires to modify this high fidelity code,
which cannot be done, for example in an industrial context if the high fidelity
code is only accessible as a ""black-box"" solver. The Non Intrusive Reduced
Basis method (NIRB) has been introduced in the context of finite elements as a
good alternative to reduce the implementation costs of these
parameter-dependent problems. The method is efficient in other contexts than
the FEM one, like with finite volume schemes, which are more often used in an
industrial environment. In this case, some adaptations need to be done as the
degrees of freedom in FV methods have different meenings. At this time, error
estimates have only been studied with FEM solvers. In this paper, we present a
generalisation of the NIRB method to Finite Volume schemes and we show that
estimates established for FEM solvers also hold in the FVM setting. We first
prove our results for the hybrid-Mimetic Finite Difference method (hMFD), which
is part the Hybrid Mixed Mimetic methods (HMM) family. Then, we explain how
these results apply more generally to other FV schemes. Some of them are

solver is based on the spectral element method, however other numerical methods
could be applied. The RBM reduces the computational burden by solving the
problem in a low-dimensional subspace for parametrized frequency-independent

solved in the Laplace domain, which ensures the stability of the reduced order

meta-learning into region-based detection frameworks. Despite its success, the
said paradigm is constrained by several factors, such as (i) low-quality region
proposals for novel classes and (ii) negligence of the inter-class correlation
among different classes. Such limitations hinder the generalization of
base-class knowledge for the detection of novel-class objects. In this work, we
design Meta-DETR, a novel few-shot detection framework that incorporates
correlational aggregation for meta-learning into DETR detection frameworks.
Meta-DETR works entirely at image level without any region proposals, which
circumvents the constraint of inaccurate proposals in prevalent few-shot
detection frameworks. Besides, Meta-DETR can simultaneously attend to multiple
support classes within a single feed-forward. This unique design allows
capturing the inter-class correlation among different classes, which
significantly reduces the misclassification of similar classes and enhances
knowledge generalization to novel classes. Experiments over multiple few-shot
object detection benchmarks show that the proposed Meta-DETR outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins. The implementation codes will be
released at https://github.com/ZhangGongjie/Meta-DETR.

describe the excitations accurately can be computationally prohibitive due to
the relatively large system sizes involved. In this work, we demonstrate a
method that allows optical absorption spectra to be computed both efficiently
and at high accuracy. Our approach is based on the spectral warping method
successfully applied to molecules in solvent. It involves calculating the
absorption spectrum of a supercell of the full molecular crystal using
semi-local TDDFT, before warping the spectrum using a transformation derived
from smaller-scale semi-local and hybrid TDDFT calculations on isolated dimers.
We demonstrate the power of this method on three polymorphs of the well known
colour polymorphic compound ROY, and find that it outperforms both small-scale
hybrid TDDFT dimer calculations and large-scale semi-local TDDFT supercell
calculations, when compared to experiment.

graphs in sparse settings where the average degree remains bounded. However,
many random graph properties do not directly converge when the random graph
converges locally. A notable, and important, random graph property that does
not follow from local convergence is the size and uniqueness of the giant
component. We provide a simple criterion that guarantees that local convergence
of a random graph implies the convergence of the proportion of vertices in the
maximal connected component. We further show that, when this condition holds,
the local properties of the giant are also described by the local limit.
  We apply this novel method to the configuration model as a proof of concept,
reproving a result that is well-established. As a side result this proof, we

artery-vein(A/V) separation plays a crucial role in assisting doctors in
preoperative planning for lung cancer surgery. However, distinguishing arterial
from venous irrigation in chest CT images remains a challenge due to the
similarity and complex structure of the arteries and veins. We propose a novel
method for automatic separation of pulmonary arteries and veins from chest CT
images. The method consists of three parts. First, global connection
information and local feature information are used to construct a complete
topological tree and ensure the continuity of vessel reconstruction. Second,
the Twin-Pipe network proposed can automatically learn the differences between
arteries and veins at different levels to reduce classification errors caused
by changes in terminal vessel characteristics. Finally, the topology optimizer
considers interbranch and intrabranch topological relationships to maintain
spatial consistency to avoid the misclassification of A/V irrigations. We
validate the performance of the method on chest CT images. Compared with manual
classification, the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 96.2% on
noncontrast chest CT. In addition, the method has been proven to have good
generalization, that is, the accuracies of 93.8% and 94.8% are obtained for CT
scans from other devices and other modes, respectively. The result of pulmonary
artery-vein obtained by the proposed method can provide better assistance for
preoperative planning of lung cancer surgery.

with their natural environments. A fundamental challenge when analysing
recorded single particle trajectories is the inverse problem of inferring the
physical model or class of models of the underlying random walks. Reliable
inference is made difficult by the inherent stochastic nature of single
particle motion, by experimental noise, and by the short duration of most
experimental trajectories. Model identification is further complicated by the
fact that main physical properties of random walk models are only defined
asymptotically, and are thus degenerate for short trajectories. Here, we
introduce a new, fast approach to inferring random walk properties based on
graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach consists in associating a vector of
features with each observed position, and a sparse graph structure with each
observed trajectory. By performing simulation-based supervised learning on this
construct [1], we show that we can reliably learn models of random walks and
their anomalous exponents. The method can naturally be applied to trajectories
of any length. We show its efficiency in analysing various anomalous random
walks of biological relevance that were proposed in the AnDi challenge [2]. We
explore how information is encoded in the GNN, and we show that it learns
relevant physical features of the random walks. We furthermore evaluate its
ability to generalize to types of trajectories not seen during training, and we
show that the GNN retains high accuracy even with few parameters. We finally
discuss the possibility to leverage these networks to analyse experimental
data.

The line resolution is usually limited by a combination of first-order Doppler
broadening due to particle thermal motion and of a short transit time through
the excitation beam. For trapped particles, suitable laser cooling techniques
can lead to strong confinement (Lamb-Dicke regime, LDR) and thus to optical
spectroscopy free of these effects. For non-laser coolable spectroscopy ions,
this has so far only been achieved when trapping one or two atomic ions,
together with a single laser-coolable atomic ion [1,2]. Here we show that
one-photon optical spectroscopy free of Doppler and transit broadening can also
be obtained with more easily prepared ensembles of ions, if performed with
mid-infrared radiation. We demonstrate the method on molecular ions. We trap
approximately 100 molecular hydrogen ions (HD$^{+}$) within a Coulomb cluster
of a few thousand laser-cooled atomic ions and perform laser spectroscopy of
the fundamental vibrational transition. Transition frequencies were determined

intervals of interest. From a theoretical viewpoint, the de-biased estimator
comes with a sharp minimax-optinmal rate of estimation error whereas the
Bayesian approach reaches this rate with an additional logarithmic factor. Our
simulation studies show originally interesting results that the de-biased
estimator is just as good as the Bayesain estimators. Moreover, Bayesian
approaches are much more stable and can outperform the de-biased estimator in
the case of small samples. However, we also find that the length of the
confidence intervals revealed by the de-biased estimator for an entry is
absolutely shorter than the length of the considered credible interval. These
suggest further theoretical studies on the estimation error and the
concentration for Bayesian methods as they are being quite limited up to
present.

understand whether classical continual learning techniques for flat and
sequential data have a tangible impact on performances when applied to graph
data. To do so, we experiment with a structure-agnostic model and a deep graph
network in a robust and controlled environment on three different datasets. The
benchmark is complemented by an investigation on the effect of
structure-preserving regularization techniques on catastrophic forgetting. We
find that replay is the most effective strategy in so far, which also benefits
the most from the use of regularization. Our findings suggest interesting
future research at the intersection of the continual and graph representation
learning fields. Finally, we provide researchers with a flexible software
framework to reproduce our results and carry out further experiments.

physics-based method for the prediction of the next solar cycle strength.
However, to make a reliable prediction of a cycle, is the polar field at the
solar minimum of the previous cycle enough or we need the polar field of many
previous cycles? To answer this question, we performed several simulations
using Babcock-Leighton type flux transport dynamo models with the
stochastically forced source for the poloidal field ($\alpha$ term). We show
that when the dynamo is operating near the critical dynamo transition or only
weakly supercritical, the polar field of the cycle n determines the amplitude
of the next several cycles (at least three). However, when the dynamo is
substantially supercritical, this correlation of the polar field is reduced to
one cycle. This change in the memory of the polar field from multi- to
one-cycle with the increase of the super-criticality of the dynamo is
independent of the importance of various turbulent transport processes in the
model. We further show that when the dynamo operates near the critical, it
produces frequent extended episodes of weaker activity, resembling the solar
grand minima. The occurrence of grand minima is accompanied by the multi-cycle
correlation of polar field. The frequency of grand minima decreases with the
increase of supercriticality of the dynamo.

networks are widely used to study their dynamics. Temporal network data often
consist in a succession of static networks over consecutive time windows whose
length, however, is arbitrary, not necessarily corresponding to any intrinsic
timescale of the system. Moreover, the resulting view of social network
evolution is unsatisfactory: short time windows contain little information,
whereas aggregating over large time windows blurs the dynamics. Going from a
temporal network to a meaningful evolving representation of a social network
therefore remains a challenge. Here we introduce a framework to that purpose:
transforming temporal network data into an evolving weighted network where the
weights of the links between individuals are updated at every interaction. Most
importantly, this transformation takes into account the interdependence of
social relationships due to the finite attention capacities of individuals:
each interaction between two individuals not only reinforces their mutual
relationship but also weakens their relationships with others. We study a
concrete example of such a transformation and apply it to several data sets of
social interactions. Using temporal contact data collected in schools, we show
how our framework highlights specificities in their structure and temporal
organization. We then introduce a synthetic perturbation into a data set of
interactions in a group of baboons to show that it is possible to detect a
perturbation in a social group on a wide range of timescales and parameters.
Our framework brings new perspectives to the analysis of temporal social
networks.

fields that can be suspended in the solar atmosphere against gravity. The
gravitational stability of threads, in the absence of non-ideal effects, is
comprehensively investigated in the present work by means of an elementary but
effective model. Based on purely hydrodynamic equations in one spatial
dimension and applying line-tying conditions at the footpoints of the magnetic
field lines, we derive analytical expressions for the different feasible
equilibria and the corresponding frequencies of oscillation. We find that the
system allows for stable and unstable equilibrium solutions subject to the
initial position of the thread, its density contrast and length, and the total
length of the magnetic field lines. The transition between the two types of
solutions is produced at specific bifurcation points that have been determined
analytically in some particular cases. When the thread is initially at the top
of the concave magnetic field, that is at the apex, we find a supercritical
pitchfork bifurcation, while for a shifted initial thread position with respect
to this point the symmetry is broken and the system is characterised by an
S-shaped bifurcation. The plain results presented in this paper shed new light
on the behaviour of threads in curved magnetic fields under the presence of
gravity and help to interpret more complex numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
simulations about similar structures.

wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in a two-band model system in a square
lattice. One of the bands has a net attractive interaction ($J_d$) that is
responsible for SC. The model includes on-site Coulomb repulsion between
quasi-particles in different bands ($U_{dc}$) and the hybridization ($V$)
between them. We are interested in describing inter-metallic systems with a
$d$-band of moderately correlated electrons, for which a mean-field
approximation is adequate, coexisting with a large $sp$-band. For simplicity,
all interactions and the hybridization $V$ are considered site-independent. We
obtain the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian numerically and minimize the free
energy density with respect to the relevant parameters to obtain the phase
diagrams as function of $J_d$, $U_{dc}$, $V$, composition ($n_{\mathrm{tot}}$)
and the relative depth of the bands ($\epsilon_{d0}$). We consider two types of
superconducting ground states coexisting with the CDW. One is a homogeneous
ground state and the other is a pair density wave where the SC order parameter
has the same spatial modulation of the CDW. Our results show that the CDW and
SC orders compete, but depending on the parameters of the model these phases
may coexist. The model reproduces most of the experimental features of high
dimensionality ($d>1$) metals with competing CDW and SC states, including the
existence of first and second-order phase transitions in their phase diagrams.

  Skeleton-Based Action Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Existing methods for skeleton-based action recognition mainly focus on
improving the recognition accuracy, whereas the efficiency of the model is
rarely considered. Recently, there are some works trying to speed up the
skeleton modeling by designing light-weight modules. However, in addition to
the model size, the amount of the data involved in the calculation is also an
important factor for the running speed, especially for the skeleton data where
most of the joints are redundant or non-informative to identify a specific
skeleton. Besides, previous works usually employ one fix-sized model for all
the samples regardless of the difficulty of recognition, which wastes
computations for easy samples. To address these limitations, a novel approach,
called AdaSGN, is proposed in this paper, which can reduce the computational
cost of the inference process by adaptively controlling the input number of the
joints of the skeleton on-the-fly. Moreover, it can also adaptively select the
optimal model size for each sample to achieve a better trade-off between
accuracy and efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging
datasets, namely, NTU-60, NTU-120 and SHREC, to verify the superiority of the
proposed approach, where AdaSGN achieves comparable or even higher performance
with much lower GFLOPs compared with the baseline method.

(banknotes) from the perspective of logistics warehousing costs. Although it
has long been the dream of economists to stabilize the buying power of the
monetary units, the goal we have honest money always broken since the central
bank depreciate the currency without limit. From the point of view of modern
logistics, the key functions of money are the store of value and low logistics
(circulation and warehouse) cost. Although commodity money (such as gold and
silver) has the advantages of a wealth store, its disadvantage is the high
logistics cost. In comparison to commodity money, credit currency and digital
currency cannot protect wealth from loss over a long period while their
logistics costs are negligible. We proved that there is not such honest money
from the perspective of logistics costs, which is both the store of value like
precious metal and without logistics costs in circulation like digital
currency. The reason hidden in the back of the depreciation of banknotes is the
black hole of storage charge of the anchor overtime after digitizing commodity
money. Accordingly, it is not difficult to infer the inevitable collapse of the
Bretton woods system. Therefore, we introduce a brand-new currency named honest
devalued stable-coin and built a attenuation model of intrinsic value of the
honest money based on the change mechanism of storage cost of anchor assets,
like gold, which will lay the theoretical foundation for a stable monetary
system.

high-resolution ensembles include an explicit treatment of convective processes
and dynamically downscale the ECMWF global data, which have a grid spacing of
approximately 18 km. The predictions are verified against rain-gauge data and
their accuracy is evaluated over that of the driving coarser-resolution

ratio of simulation length to wall-clock time) of the three limited-area models
to estimate the computational effort for operational convection-permitting

with increasing numbers of computing elements (from 36 to 1152 cores).
Objective verification methods generally show that convection-permitting
forecasts outperform global forecasts for both events, although precipitation
peaks remain largely underestimated for one of the two events. Comparing
simulation speeds, the MOLOCH model is the fastest and the Meso-NH is the
slowest one. The WRF model attains efficient scalability, whereas it is limited

demonstrate how the model simulation speed has the largest impact on a joint

predictions, does not differ substantially.

  Multiple Semantic Scales","8pages, accepted by CVPR 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a new fundamental characteristic, \ie, the dynamic
range, from real-world metric tools to deep visual recognition. In metrology,
the dynamic range is a basic quality of a metric tool, indicating its
flexibility to accommodate various scales. Larger dynamic range offers higher
flexibility. In visual recognition, the multiple scale problem also exist.
Different visual concepts may have different semantic scales. For example,
``Animal'' and ``Plants'' have a large semantic scale while ``Elk'' has a much
smaller one. Under a small semantic scale, two different elks may look quite
\emph{different} to each other . However, under a large semantic scale (\eg,
animals and plants), these two elks should be measured as being \emph{similar}.
%We argue that such flexibility is also important for deep metric learning,
because different visual concepts indeed correspond to different semantic
scales.
  Introducing the dynamic range to deep metric learning, we get a novel
computer vision task, \ie, the Dynamic Metric Learning. It aims to learn a
scalable metric space to accommodate visual concepts across multiple semantic
scales. Based on three types of images, \emph{i.e.}, vehicle, animal and online
products, we construct three datasets for Dynamic Metric Learning. We benchmark
these datasets with popular deep metric learning methods and find Dynamic
Metric Learning to be very challenging. The major difficulty lies in a conflict
between different scales: the discriminative ability under a small scale
usually compromises the discriminative ability under a large one, and vice
versa. As a minor contribution, we propose Cross-Scale Learning (CSL) to
alleviate such conflict. We show that CSL consistently improves the baseline on
all the three datasets. The datasets and the code will be publicly available at

10000x10000 pixels) style transfer for the first time. Most of the existing
state-of-the-art methods would fall short due to massive memory cost and small
stroke size when processing ultra-high resolution images. URST completely
avoids the memory problem caused by ultra-high resolution images by (1)
dividing the image into small patches and (2) performing patch-wise style
transfer with a novel Thumbnail Instance Normalization (TIN). Specifically, TIN
can extract thumbnail features' normalization statistics and apply them to
small patches, ensuring the style consistency among different patches.
  Overall, the URST framework has three merits compared to prior arts. (1) We
divide input image into small patches and adopt TIN, successfully transferring
image style with arbitrary high-resolution. (2) Experiments show that our URST
surpasses existing SOTA methods on ultra-high resolution images benefiting from
the effectiveness of the proposed stroke perceptual loss in enlarging the
stroke size. (3) Our URST can be easily plugged into most existing style
transfer methods and directly improve their performance even without training.

exhibits topologically nontrivial band structures, chiral charge order and
superconductivity, presenting a unique platform for realizing exotic electronic
states. The nature of the superconducting state and the corresponding pairing
symmetry are key questions that demand experimental clarification. Here, using
a technique based on the tunneling diode oscillator, the magnetic penetration
depth $\Delta\lambda(T)$ of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ was measured down to 0.07 K. A clear
exponential behavior in $\Delta\lambda(T)$ with marked deviations from a $T$ or
$T^2$ temperature dependence is observed at low temperatures, indicating a
deficiency of nodal quasiparticles. Temperature dependence of the superfluid
density and electronic specific heat can be described by two-gap $s$-wave
superconductivity, consistent with the presence of multiple Fermi surfaces in
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. These results evidence nodeless superconductivity in
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ under ambient pressure, and constrain the allowed pairing

Clustering, an efficient and interpretable method for cell-type discovery from

different from current approaches, calculates a non-parametric posterior
probability that each cell is assigned a cell-type label. These posterior
distributions allow for the evaluation of a label confidence for each cell and
enable the computation of ""label entropies,"" highlighting transitions along
developmental trajectories. Furthermore, we show that Forest Fire Clustering
can make robust, inductive inferences in an online-learning context and can
readily scale to millions of cells. Finally, we demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art clustering approaches on diverse benchmarks of
simulated and experimental data. Overall, Forest Fire Clustering is a useful
tool for rare cell type discovery in large-scale single-cell analysis.

Alongside this pandemic, people have experienced a parallel infodemic, i.e., an

  Learning",,,,,"cs.SI cs.CY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online hate is a growing concern on many social media platforms and other
sites. To combat it, technology companies are increasingly identifying and
sanctioning `hateful users' rather than simply moderating hateful content. Yet,
most research in online hate detection to date has focused on hateful content.
This paper examines how fairer and more accurate hateful user detection systems
can be developed by incorporating social network information through geometric
deep learning. Geometric deep learning dynamically learns information-rich
network representations and can generalise to unseen nodes. This is essential
for moving beyond manually engineered network features, which lack scalability
and produce information-sparse network representations. This paper compares the
accuracy of geometric deep learning with other techniques which either exclude
network information or incorporate it through manual feature engineering (e.g.,
node2vec). It also evaluates the fairness of these techniques using the
`predictive equality' criteria, comparing the false positive rates on a subset
of 136 African-American users with 4836 other users. Geometric deep learning
produces the most accurate and fairest classifier, with an AUC score of 90.8\%
on the entire dataset and a false positive rate of zero among the
African-American subset for the best performing model. This highlights the
benefits of more effectively incorporating social network features in automated
hateful user detection. Such an approach is also easily operationalized for
real-world content moderation as it has an efficient and scalable design.

large amount of training data or extra supervision to obtain comparable
performance with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To overcome these
limitations, we analyze the potential drawbacks when directly borrowing
Transformer architectures from NLP. Then we propose a new
\textbf{Convolution-enhanced image Transformer (CeiT)} which combines the
advantages of CNNs in extracting low-level features, strengthening locality,
and the advantages of Transformers in establishing long-range dependencies.
Three modifications are made to the original Transformer: \textbf{1)} instead
of the straightforward tokenization from raw input images, we design an
\textbf{Image-to-Tokens (I2T)} module that extracts patches from generated
low-level features; \textbf{2)} the feed-froward network in each encoder block
is replaced with a \textbf{Locally-enhanced Feed-Forward (LeFF)} layer that
promotes the correlation among neighboring tokens in the spatial dimension;
\textbf{3)} a \textbf{Layer-wise Class token Attention (LCA)} is attached at
the top of the Transformer that utilizes the multi-level representations.
  Experimental results on ImageNet and seven downstream tasks show the
effectiveness and generalization ability of CeiT compared with previous
Transformers and state-of-the-art CNNs, without requiring a large amount of
training data and extra CNN teachers. Besides, CeiT models also demonstrate
better convergence with $3\times$ fewer training iterations, which can reduce
the training cost significantly\footnote{Code and models will be released upon

differentiable evolutionary framework named AutoSpace, which evolves the search
space to an optimal one with following novel techniques: a differentiable
fitness scoring function to efficiently evaluate the performance of cells and a
reference architecture to speedup the evolution procedure and avoid falling
into sub-optimal solutions. The framework is generic and compatible with
additional computational constraints, making it feasible to learn specialized
search spaces that fit different computational budgets. With the learned search
space, the performance of recent NAS algorithms can be improved significantly
compared with using previously manually designed spaces. Remarkably, the models
generated from the new search space achieve 77.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet
under the mobile setting (MAdds < 500M), out-performing previous SOTA
EfficientNet-B0 by 0.7%. All codes will be made public.

in synthetic biological research. Modeling TLFM experiments based on real data
may enable researchers to repeat certain experiments with minor effort. This
thesis is a study towards deep learning-based modeling of TLFM experiments on
the image level. The modeling of TLFM experiments, by way of the example of
trapped yeast cells, is split into two tasks. The first task is to generate
synthetic image data based on real image data. To approach this problem, a
novel generative adversarial network, for conditionalized and unconditionalized
image generation, is proposed. The second task is the simulation of brightfield
microscopy images over multiple discrete time-steps. To tackle this simulation
task an advanced future frame prediction model is introduced. The proposed
models are trained and tested on a novel dataset that is presented in this
thesis. The obtained results showed that the modeling of TLFM experiments, with
deep learning, is a proper approach, but requires future research to
effectively model real-world experiments.

and affected people during natural disasters. Machine learning can help
structure and extract information from the large volume of messages shared
during a crisis; however, the constantly evolving nature of crises makes
effective domain adaptation essential. Supervised classification is limited by
unchangeable class labels that may not be relevant to new events, and
unsupervised topic modelling by insufficient prior knowledge. In this paper, we
bridge the gap between the two and show that BERT embeddings finetuned on
crisis-related tweet classification can effectively be used to adapt to a new
crisis, discovering novel topics while preserving relevant classes from
supervised training, and leveraging bidirectional self-attention to extract
topic keywords. We create a dataset of tweets from a snowstorm to evaluate our
method's transferability to new crises, and find that it outperforms
traditional topic models in both automatic, and human evaluations grounded in
the needs of crisis managers. More broadly, our method can be used for textual
domain adaptation where the latent classes are unknown but overlap with known
classes from other domains.

  Approximations with Weak Endpoint Singularities: Effects of Different Bases",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When solving differential equations by a spectral method, it is often
convenient to shift from Chebyshev polynomials $T_{n}(x)$ with coefficients
$a_{n}$ to modified basis functions that incorporate the boundary conditions.
For homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, $u(\pm 1)=0$, popular choices
include the ``Chebyshev difference basis"", $\varsigma_{n}(x) \equiv T_{n+2}(x)
- T_{n}(x)$ with coefficients here denoted $b_{n}$ and the ``quadratic-factor
basis functions"" $\varrho_{n}(x) \equiv (1-x^{2}) T_{n}(x)$ with coefficients
$c_{n}$. If $u(x)$ is weakly singular at the boundaries, then $a_{n}$ will
decrease proportionally to $\mathcal{O}(A(n)/n^{\kappa})$ for some positive
constant $\kappa$, where the $A(n)$ is a logarithm or a constant. We prove that
the Chebyshev difference coefficients $b_{n}$ decrease more slowly by a factor
of $1/n$ while the quadratic-factor coefficients $c_{n}$ decrease more slowly
still as $\mathcal{O}(A(n)/n^{\kappa-2})$. The error for the unconstrained
Chebyshev series, truncated at degree $n=N$, is
$\mathcal{O}(|A(N)|/N^{\kappa})$ in the interior, but is worse by one power of
$N$ in narrow boundary layers near each of the endpoints. Despite having nearly
identical error \emph{norms}, the error in the Chebyshev basis is concentrated
in boundary layers near both endpoints, whereas the error in the
quadratic-factor and difference basis sets is nearly uniform oscillations over
the entire interval in $x$. Meanwhile, for Chebyshev polynomials and the
quadratic-factor basis, the value of the derivatives at the endpoints is
$\mathcal{O}(N^{2})$, but only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ for the difference basis.

2-approximation of maximin share (MMS) fairness [Budish, 2011] for symmetric

current work, and our result implies a 2-approximation algorithm. Another
by-product result is that an EFX and a weighted EF1 allocation for indivisible
chores exist if all agents have the same ordinal preference, which might be of
independent interest. We then consider the partial information setting and
design algorithms that only use agents' ordinal preferences to compute
approximately PROPX allocations. Our algorithm achieves a 2-approximation for
both symmetric and asymmetric agents, and the approximation ratio is optimal.
Finally, we study the price of fairness (PoF), i.e., the loss in social welfare
by enforcing allocations to be (weighted) PROPX. We prove that the tight ratio

prevalence of the disease rather than to provide an actionable decision at the
individual level. Materials and Methods: The text processing pipeline first
extracts COVID-19 symptoms and related concepts such as severity, duration,
negations, and body parts from patients' posts using conditional random fields.
An unsupervised rule-based algorithm is then applied to establish relations
between concepts in the next step of the pipeline. The extracted concepts and
relations are subsequently used to construct two different vector
representations of each post. These vectors are applied separately to build
support vector machine learning models to triage patients into three categories

be achieved when the models are trained using predicted labels from concept
extraction and rule-based classifiers, thus yielding end-to-end machine

revealed in another COVID-19 dataset. In particular, we found that the most
important features are not always the most frequent ones.

length is the sample size, weight is the number of data labeled with one, and
the Hamming distance between code words is four. We then introduce the concept
of a light constant weight code and show similar results for nonzero LPOCV

contant weight codes. These results pave the way towards the design of new

atmospheric flow simulation is the imbalances it may introduce. Acoustic
fast-mode imbalances of the order of the slower dynamics can be negated by
employing a blended numerical model with seamless access to the compressible
and the soundproof pseudo-incompressible dynamics. Here, the blended modelling
strategy by Benacchio et al., MWR, vol. 142 (2014) is upgraded in an advanced
numerical framework and extended with a Bayesian local ensemble data
assimilation method. Upon assimilation of data, the model configuration is
switched to the pseudo-incompressible regime for one time-step. After that, the
model configuration is switched back to the compressible model for the duration
of the assimilation window. The switching between model regimes is repeated for
each subsequent assimilation window. An improved blending strategy for the
numerical model ensures that a single time-step in the pseudo-incompressible
regime is sufficient to suppress imbalances coming from the initialisation and
data assimilation. This improvement is based on three innovations: (i) the
association of pressure fields computed at different stages of the numerical
integration with actual time levels; (ii) a conversion of pressure-related
variables between the model regimes derived from low Mach number asymptotics;
and (iii) a judicious selection of the pressure variables used in converting
numerical model states when a switch of models occurs. Idealised
two-dimensional travelling vortex and buoyancy-driven bubble convection
experiments show that acoustic imbalances arising from data assimilation can be
eliminated by using this blended model, thereby achieving balanced analysis
fields.

design of resilient encoding schemes, namely, the coupling between encoding
strategies of different signals, and the synchronization between the encoder
and decoder. To address these challenges, a novel structure that is equipped
with a deadbeat controller as well as a delicate transmission protocol for the
input and output channels, co-designed leveraging the controllability index, is
put forward. When both input and output channels are subject to DoS attacks and
quantization, the proposed structure is shown able to decouple the encoding
schemes for input, output, and estimated output signals. This property is
further corroborated by designing encoding schemes as well as conditions that
ensure exponential stability of the closed-loop system. On the other hand, when
only the output channel is subject to network phenomenon, the proposed
structure can achieve exponential stabilization without acknowledgment (ACK)
signals, in contrast to existing ACK-based results. Finally, a numerical
example is given to demonstrate the practical merits of the proposed approach

can be applied independently of the sign of the polarizability, i.e., for both

variation of the laser polarization we extract the scalar and the tensorial

natural linewidth. We find our result to be in excellent agreement with

deficiencies of DML estimators. Theoretically, the RCL estimators i) satisfy
the (higher-order) orthogonal condition and are as \textit{consistent and
doubly robust} as the DML estimators, and ii) get rid of the error-compounding
issue. Empirically, the comprehensive experiments show that: i) the RCL
estimators give more stable estimations of the causal parameters than DML; ii)
the RCL estimators outperform traditional estimators and their variants when
applying different machine learning models on both simulation and benchmark
datasets, and a mimic consumer credit dataset generated by WGAN.

technologies, big data analytics have become vastly popular in the smart grid
domain, informing stakeholders of the best power utilization strategy. However,
these power-related data are stored and owned by different parties. For
example, power consumption data are stored in numerous transformer stations
across cities; mobility data of the population, which are important indicators
of power consumption, are held by mobile companies. Direct data sharing might
compromise party benefits, individual privacy and even national security.
Inspired by the federated learning scheme from Google AI, we propose a
federated learning framework for smart grids, which enables collaborative
learning of power consumption patterns without leaking individual power traces.
Horizontal federated learning is employed when data are scattered in the sample
space; vertical federated learning, on the other hand, is designed for the case
with data scattered in the feature space. Case studies show that, with proper
encryption schemes such as Paillier encryption, the machine learning models
constructed from the proposed framework are lossless, privacy-preserving and
effective. Finally, the promising future of federated learning in other facets
of the smart grid is discussed, including electric vehicles, distributed
generation/consumption and integrated energy systems.

We propose to parameterize both MPC and MHE formulations, where certain

the sake of tackling the unmodeled and partially observable dynamics, we
leverage the Reinforcement Learning (RL) to tune the parameters of MPC and MHE

states with minimum uncertainty are more likely to lead to task success. To
recover from high uncertainty cases, the robot monitors its uncertainty along a
trajectory and explores possible actions in the state-action space to bring

neural networks (CNNs)that can be improved by stacking more convolutional

specifically, we empirically observe that such scaling difficulty is caused by
the attention collapse issue: as the transformer goes deeper, the attention
maps gradually become similar and even much the same after certain layers. In
other words, the feature maps tend to be identical in the top layers of deep
ViT models. This fact demonstrates that in deeper layers of ViTs, the
self-attention mechanism fails to learn effective concepts for representation
learning and hinders the model from getting expected performance gain. Based on
above observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, named
Re-attention, to re-generate the attention maps to increase their diversity at
different layers with negligible computation and memory cost. The pro-posed
method makes it feasible to train deeper ViT models with consistent performance
improvements via minor modification to existing ViT models. Notably, when

leptoquark from the Pati-Salam (PS) unification with extra vectorlike families.
The leptoquark mass is constrained to be heavier than PeV-scale by the
measurement of a flavor violating kaon decay, $K_L \to \mu e$, in conventional
models. This strong constraint can be avoided by introducing vectorlike
families consistently with the quark and lepton masses and CKM and PMNS
matrices. The other flavor violating processes are also suppressed. In this
model, the vector leptoquark can be sufficiently light to explain the recent
$b\to s\mu\mu$ anomaly, while the $b\to c\tau\nu$ anomaly is difficult to be
explained due to the strong constraints from the $Z^\prime$ boson and
vectorlike quark searches at the LHC. When the $b\to s\mu\mu$ anomaly is
explained, we show that $\mathcal{O}({0.2})$ % tuning is required in the
fermion matrix, the future experiments in $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu$-$e$
conversions will cover the most available parameter space, and sizable neutral
meson mixings, induced by the extra Higgs doublets, are unavoidable.

containing multiple objects (things) against natural background (stuff),
conditioned on a given layout. Built upon the recent advances in generative
adversarial networks (GANs), existing L2I models have made great progress.
However, a close inspection of their generated images reveals two major
limitations: (1) the object-to-object as well as object-to-stuff relations are
often broken and (2) each object's appearance is typically distorted lacking
the key defining characteristics associated with the object class. We argue
that these are caused by the lack of context-aware object and stuff feature
encoding in their generators, and location-sensitive appearance representation
in their discriminators. To address these limitations, two new modules are
proposed in this work. First, a context-aware feature transformation module is
introduced in the generator to ensure that the generated feature encoding of
either object or stuff is aware of other co-existing objects/stuff in the
scene. Second, instead of feeding location-insensitive image features to the
discriminator, we use the Gram matrix computed from the feature maps of the
generated object images to preserve location-sensitive information, resulting
in much enhanced object appearance. Extensive experiments show that the
proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO-Thing-Stuff

decoding schemes remain in making a continuous prediction to compensate for the
hysteretic response caused by mechanical transmission. In this paper, we solve
this problem by proposing an ahead of time continuous prediction of lower limb
kinematics, with the prediction of knee angles during level walking as a case
study. Firstly, an end-to-end kinematics prediction network(KinPreNet),
consisting of a feature extractor and an angle predictor, is proposed and
experimentally compared with features and methods traditionally used in
ahead-of-time prediction of gait phases. Secondly, inspired by the
electromechanical delay(EMD), we further explore our algorithm's capability of
compensating response delay of mechanical transmission by validating the
performance of the different sections of prediction time. And we experimentally
reveal the time boundary of compensating the hysteretic response. Thirdly, a
comparison of employing EMG signals or not is performed to reveal the EMG and
kinematic signals collaborated contributions to the continuous prediction.
During the experiments, EMG signals of nine muscles and knee angles calculated
from inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals are recorded from ten healthy
subjects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of continuously
predicting lower-limb kinematics in an ahead-of-time manner based on the

albeit important, topic with the increasing trend of their computation and
memory requirements. While existing works discuss the difficulty of compressing
GANs during training, requiring novel methods designed with the instability of
GANs training in mind, we show that existing compression methods (namely
clipping and quantization) may be directly applied to compress GANs
post-training, without any additional changes. High compression levels may
distort the generated set, likely leading to an increase of outliers that may
negatively affect the overall assessment of existing k-nearest neighbor (KNN)
based metrics. We propose two new precision and recall metrics based on
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), which, on top of increasing the outlier
robustness, decrease the complexity of assessing an evaluation sample against
$n$ reference samples from $O(n)$ to $O(\log(n))$, if using LSH and KNN, and to
$O(1)$, if only applying LSH. We show that low-bit compression of several
pre-trained GANs on multiple datasets induces a trade-off between precision and

quantum models, in which the sequence converges to a probability measure on
$\bR^{2n}$, defining a classical algebraic state. The observables are here
represented in terms of a Berezin quantization map which associates classical
observables (functions on the phase space) to quantum observables (elements of
$C^*$ algebras) parametrized by $\hbar$. The existence of this classical limit
is in particular proved for ground states of a wide class of Schr\""{o}dinger
operators, where the classical limiting state is obtained in terms of a Haar
integral. The support of the classical state (a probability measure on the

allows for both quantum and classical theories, it is highly suitable to study
the theoretical concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) as an emergent
phenomenon when passing from the quantum realm to the classical world by
switching off $\hbar$. To this end, a detailed mathematical description is

The structural diversity of the non fragmented structures was analysed using
order parameters which were chosen as the number of 5 or 6 carbon rings and the
asphericity constant $\beta$. The most abundant and lowest energy population
was found to correspond to a flakes population, constituted of isomers of
variable shapes possessing a large number of 5 or 6-carbon rings. This
population is characterized by a larger number of spherical isomers when
$n_H/n_C$ increases. Simultaneously, the fraction of the pretzels population
constituted of spherical isomers possessing fewer 5 or 6 carbon ring cycles
increases. For all hydrogenation rates, the fraction of cages population
remains extremely minor while the branched population is the highest energy
population for all $n_H/n_C$ ratios. For all C$_{24}$H$_n${n=0,6,12,18,24}
clusters, a detailed study of the evolution of the carbon ring size
distribution as a function of energy clearly shows that the stability is
correlated to the number of 6-carbon rings. A similar study for hybridization
$sp^n$ (n=1-3) shows that the number of $sp^1$ carbon atoms increases with
energy while globally the number of $sp^3$ carbon atoms increases with
$n_H/n_C$. The average values of the ionization potentials of all populations
were found to decrease when $n_H/n_C$ increases, ranging from 7.9\,eV down to
6.4\,eV that we correlated to carbon atoms hybridization $sp^n$ (n=1-3). These
results are of astrophysical interest as they should be taken into account in

Quadratic Program (QCQP), for which we provide a closed-form solution. Our
constraint is related to but less restrictive than the typical passivity
constraint used in previous literature. We conducted an experimental simulation

'deceleration' parameters for scales of 200 Mpc/h (corresponding to density
contrasts of ~0.05 in the simulated model universe), respectively. On top of

constituent galaxies. Some small fraction of stars is expected, however, to
follow the global dark matter potential of the group. In compact groups,
interactions between the galaxies should be frequent. This leads to a more
intensive material stripping from the group members, which finally forms an
intra-group light component (IGL). Therefore, the distribution of the IGL
should be related to the distribution of the total mass in the compact group
and its dynamical status. In this study we consider the distribution and
fraction of the IGL in a sample of 36 Hickson compact groups (HCGs). We use
deep observations of these compact groups (down to surface brightness $\sim 28$
mag\,arcsec$^{-2}$ in the $r$ band) obtained with the WISE $28$-inch telescope.
For five HCGs with a bright symmetric IGL component, we carry out
multicomponent photometric decomposition to simultaneously fit the galaxy
profiles and the IGL. For the remaining groups, we only fit the profiles of
their constituent galaxies. We find that the mean surface brightness of the IGL
correlates with the mean morphology of the group: it becomes brighter in the
groups with a larger fraction of early-type galaxies. On the other hand, the
IGL brightness depends on the total luminosity of the group. The IGL profile
tends to have a S\'ersic index $n\sim0.5-1$, which is generally consistent with
the mass density profile of dark matter haloes in compact groups obtained from
cosmological simulations.

fluxes over years out of our searching for intermediate-mass black holes
(IMBHs), we conduct a systematic investigation of changing-look (CL) and
large-variability AGNs. We collect all the CL AGNs at z<0.15 and the
reverberation mapped AGNs with strongly variable broad Halpha, and perform
careful decomposition fittings to both their images and spectra. We find two
observational facts: (1) The host galaxies of local CL and large-variability
AGNs, mainly being Seyferts, are in the red (gas-poor) tail of the general
Seyfert galaxy population. (2) In contrast, there is a significant trend that
their more luminous counterparts namely CL and extremely variable quasars (CLQs
and EVQs) are different: CLQs are generally in blue galaxies; in terms of the
diagram of SFR and M* local CL Seyfert galaxies are located in the green
valley, whereas CLQ hosts are in the star-forming main sequence. We propose
explanations for those strongly variable Seyferts and quasars, respectively,
under the thought that accretion disks broadly depend on nuclear fueling modes.
Local large-variability and CL Seyferts are in nuclear famine mode, where
cold-gas clumps can be formed stochastically in the fueling flow, and their
episodic infall produces sharp peaks in the accretion-rate curve. CLQs and EVQs
are in feast fueling mode, which may account for both their preference to blue
galaxies and their variability pattern (high-amplitude tail of the continuous
distribution). Lastly, we propose a new thinking: to search for IMBHs by
optical variability in red galaxies.

explicitly evaluate the impact of the theoretical assumptions made in current
analyses on upcoming surveys. One effect typically neglected in present
analyses is the Doppler-shift of the measured source comoving distances. Using
Fisher matrices, we calculate the biases on the cosmological parameter values

full-field stress from an observed kinematic field when the flow rule governing

proposed equations that assume pure plastic behavior without elasticity. A
method to numerically solve these equations is also presented. In addition to
force balance, the equations are derived from the elastic-plastic decomposition
of the deformation gradient, the assumption of isotropy, and the assumption
that the function mapping the elastic strain to stress is known. The system of
equations can be directly applied to complex geometries, finite deformation,
non-linear elasticity and plasticity, compressible materials, rate dependent
materials, and a variety of hardening laws. This system of PDEs is non-linear
and time dependent. Furthermore, it overcomes an important prior limitation: it
can be directly applied to cases where some regions of a body are elastically
deforming while others are elasto-plastically deforming. A two-dimensional case
study of necking in a uniaxial tensile specimen is investigated to illustrate
and validate the method. The governing equations are numerically solved using

research community. More and more approaches have been developed on top of DL
models, also due to the unprecedented amount of software-related data that can
be used to train these models. One of the recent applications of DL in the
software engineering domain concerns the automatic detection of software
vulnerabilities. While several DL models have been developed to approach this
problem, there is still limited empirical evidence concerning their actual
effectiveness especially when compared with shallow machine learning
techniques. In this paper, we partially fill this gap by presenting a
large-scale empirical study using three vulnerability datasets and five
different source code representations (i.e., the format in which the code is
provided to the classifiers to assess whether it is vulnerable or not) to
compare the effectiveness of two widely used DL-based models and of one shallow
machine learning model in (i) classifying code functions as vulnerable or
non-vulnerable (i.e., binary classification), and (ii) classifying code
functions based on the specific type of vulnerability they contain (or ""clean"",
if no vulnerability is there). As a baseline we include in our study the AutoML
utility provided by the Google Cloud Platform. Our results show that the
experimented models are still far from ensuring reliable vulnerability
detection, and that a shallow learning classifier represents a competitive

hence, insufficient to employ deep learning techniques. We leverage the
explicit modeling of domain expertise through case-based reasoning to improve
the capabilities of Digital Twins for adapting to such situations. To this
effect, we present a modeling framework for self-adaptive manufacturing that
supports modeling domain-specific cases, describing rules for case similarity

down to low temperatures by means of field cooling the sample. This metastable
skyrmion state is energetically separated from the topologically trivial ground
state by a considerable potential barrier, a phenomenon also referred to as
topological protection. Using magnetic force microscopy on the surface of a
bulk crystal, we show that certain positions are preferentially and
reproducibly decorated with metastable skyrmions, indicating that surface

increasing number of skyrmions to overcome the potential barrier, and hence to
transform into the ground state. Most notably, we find that the unwinding of
individual skyrmions may be triggered by the magnetic tip itself, however, only
when its magnetization is aligned parallel to the external field. This implies
that the stray field of the tip is key for locally overcoming the topological
protection. Both the control of the position of topologically nontrivial states
as well as their creation and annihilation on demand pose important challenges
in the context of potential skyrmionic applications.

of changes to a process with respect to time and cost measures -- a practice
known as what-if process analysis. The usefulness of such estimations hinges on
the accuracy of the underlying simulation model. Data-Driven Simulation (DDS)
methods leverage process mining techniques to learn process simulation models
from event logs. Empirical studies have shown that, while DDS models adequately
capture the observed sequences of activities and their frequencies, they fail
to accurately capture the temporal dynamics of real-life processes. In
contrast, generative Deep Learning (DL) models are better able to capture such
temporal dynamics. The drawback of DL models is that users cannot alter them
for what-if analysis due to their black-box nature. This paper presents a
hybrid approach to learn process simulation models from event logs wherein a
(stochastic) process model is extracted via DDS techniques, and then combined
with a DL model to generate timestamped event sequences. An experimental
evaluation shows that the resulting hybrid simulation models match the temporal
accuracy of pure DL models, while partially retaining the what-if analysis
capability of DDS approaches.

coupling giving rise to an electric polarization with a characteristic
dependence on the magnetic field $\vec H$. We report magnetic force microscopy
imaging of the helical real-space spin structure on the surface of a bulk
single crystal of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. In the presence of a magnetic field, the
helimagnetic order in general reorients and acquires a homogeneous component of
the magnetization, resulting in a conical arrangement at larger fields. We
investigate this reorientation process at a temperature of 10~K for fields
close to the crystallographic $\langle 110\rangle$ direction that involves a
phase transition at $H_{c1}$. Experimental evidence is presented for the
formation of magnetic domains in real space as well as for the microscopic
origin of relaxation events that accompany the reorientation process. In
addition, the electric polarization is measured by means of Kelvin-probe force
microscopy. We show that the characteristic field dependency of the electric
polarization originates in this helimagnetic reorientation process. Our
experimental results are well described by an effective Landau theory
previously invoked for MnSi, that captures the competition between
magnetocrystalline anisotropies and Zeeman energy.

the Renyi diveregence to quantify the deviations of the galaxy distribution
from a homogeneous Poisson distribution on different length scales. We
separately carry out the analysis using the overlapping spheres and the
independent voxels. Our analysis suggests that the scale of homogeneity is
underestimated in the smaller galaxy samples due to the suppression of
inhomogeneities by the overlapping of the measuring speheres. We find that an
analysis with the independent voxels and/or use of a significantly larger
galaxy sample can help to circumvent or mitigate this problem. Combining the

theorems (NFL) have major implications for the problem of (meta) induction.
Here I review the NFL theorems, emphasizing that they do not only concern the
case where there is a uniform prior -- they prove that there are ""as many
priors"" (loosely speaking) for which any induction algorithm $A$
out-generalizes some induction algorithm $B$ as vice-versa. Importantly though,
in addition to the NFL theorems, there are many {free lunch} theorems. In
particular, the NFL theorems can only be used to compare the {marginal}
expected performance of an induction algorithm $A$ with the marginal expected
performance of an induction algorithm $B$. There is a rich set of free lunches
which instead concern the statistical correlations among the generalization
errors of induction algorithms. As I describe, the meta-induction algorithms
that Schurz advocate as a ""solution to Hume's problem"" are just an example of
such a free lunch based on correlations among the generalization errors of
induction algorithms. I end by pointing out that the prior that Schurz
advocates, which is uniform over bit frequencies rather than bit patterns, is
contradicted by thousands of experiments in statistical physics and by the
great success of the maximum entropy procedure in inductive inference.

tree structures that branch on category type and not feature. The development
in this paper is to consider a secondary order of clustering that is not the

classifier, that it is eventually clustered with. Each tree branches to store
subsets of other categories, but the rows in those subsets may also be related.
This paper is therefore concerned with looking at that second level of
clustering between the other category subsets, to try to determine if there is
any consistency over it. It is argued that Principal Components may be a
related and reciprocal type of structure, and there is an even bigger question
about the relation between exemplars and principal components, in general. The
theory is demonstrated using the Portugal Forest Fires dataset as a case study.
The Category Trees are then combined with other Self-Organising algorithms from
the author and it is suggested that they all belong to the same family type,

In this paper, we introduce a previously unconsidered, yet everyday,
high-conflict driving scenario requiring negotiations between agents of equal
rights and priorities. There exists no centralized control structure and we do
not allow communications. Therefore, it is unknown if other drivers are willing
to cooperate, and if so to what extent. We train policies to robustly negotiate
with opposing vehicles of an unobservable degree of cooperativeness using
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We propose Discrete Asymmetric Soft
Actor-Critic (DASAC), a maximum-entropy off-policy MARL algorithm allowing for
centralized training with decentralized execution. We show that using DASAC we
are able to successfully negotiate and traverse the scenario considered over
99% of the time. Our agents are robust to an unknown timing of opponent
decisions, an unobservable degree of cooperativeness of the opposing vehicle,
and previously unencountered policies. Furthermore, they learn to exhibit
human-like behaviors such as defensive driving, anticipating solution options
and interpreting the behavior of other agents.

algorithms are becoming popular tools to obtain high-resolution 3D volume
reconstructions from low-resolution stacks of 2D slices, acquired at different
orientations. To be effective, these algorithms often require accurate
segmentation of the region of interest, such as the fetal brain in suspected
pathological cases. In the case of Spina Bifida, Ebner, Wang et al.
(NeuroImage, 2020) combined their SRR algorithm with a 2-step segmentation
pipeline (2D localisation followed by a 2D segmentation network). However, if
the localisation step fails, the second network is not able to recover a
correct brain mask, thus requiring manual corrections for an effective SRR. In
this work, we aim at improving the fetal brain segmentation for SRR in Spina
Bifida. We hypothesise that a well-trained single-step UNet can achieve
accurate performance, avoiding the need of a 2-step approach. We propose a new
tool for fetal brain segmentation called MONAIfbs, which takes advantage of the
Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence (MONAI) framework. Our network
is based on the dynamic UNet (dynUNet), an adaptation of the nnU-Net framework.
When compared to the original 2-step approach proposed in Ebner-Wang, and the
same Ebner-Wang approach retrained with the expanded dataset available for this
work, the dynUNet showed to achieve higher performance using a single step
only. It also showed to reduce the number of outliers, as only 28 stacks
obtained Dice score less than 0.9, compared to 68 for Ebner-Wang and 53
Ebner-Wang expanded. The proposed dynUNet model thus provides an improvement of
the state-of-the-art fetal brain segmentation techniques, reducing the need for
manual correction in automated SRR pipelines. Our code and our trained model

not suitable for safety-critical applications since DNNs can be easily fooled
by well-crafted adversarial examples. One promising strategy to counter
adversarial attacks is to utilize spectral normalization, which ensures that
the trained model has low sensitivity towards the disturbance of input samples.
Unfortunately, this strategy requires exact computation of spectral norm, which
is computation intensive and impractical for large-scale networks. In this
paper, we introduce an approximate algorithm for spectral normalization based
on Fourier transform and layer separation. The primary contribution of our work
is to effectively combine the sparsity of weight matrix and decomposability of

architecture for human Mars mission. But, before proceeding to a giant leap and
accomplishing those mission intent, it is significant to know the extent of
possibility to expand terrestrial species on the vast red planet. Decades of
scientific exploration and experimentation through planetary landers and rovers
showed uncertain and unsatisfactory results to determine the possibility of
life on Mars. Consequently, the technological limitation has impeded to perform
in-situ experimentation and analysis on the surface. Therefore, we require soil
samples through Mars sample return vehicles for superior analysis in our
ground-based laboratories or on-orbit analysis aboard International Space
Station from the aspect of planetary protection policy. Sampling analysis
either in ground or orbit will report the presence of fundamental constituents
to harbor life. To effectuate this intent, we have proposed a unique sample
return architecture integrated with large solar Montgolfier. Here, we deploy
parachute and retro propulsion thrusters to deliver sample return vehicles on
to the surface and systematic ascend with the aid of solar Montgolfier to
propel the MSRV out of Mars atmosphere. Subsequently, the MSRV effectuates
orbital rendezvous with orbiter for the refueling process and safe return. The
proposed concept is cheap, robust and simple as compared to the current state
of MSR architectures ultimately minimizing the technological necessities. It
also detains backup plans that were found to be nowhere presented in any of
sample return strategies. Further, we have extended our discussion to
comprehensively analyze entire MSR architecture with our concept for mission
feasibility.

  Integral","Published version","International Journal of Quantum Foundations. Volume 8, Issue 3,
  July 2022, pages 125-147","10.48550/arXiv.2106.05167",,"physics.gen-ph hep-th quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  By investigating the Feynman Path Integral we prove that elementary quantum
particle dynamics are directly associated to single compact (cyclic) world-line
parameters, playing the role of the particles' internal clock, implicit in
ordinary undulatory mechanics and indirectly observed for instance in Time
Crystals. This allows us to formulate a novel purely four-dimensional stringy
description of elementary particles as possible physics beyond quantum
mechanics. The novelty of this approach is that quantum mechanics originates
from a non-trivial compact nature of the minkowskian space-time. Our result is
a further evidence in support of Elementary Cycles Theory (ECT), which in
previous papers has been proven to be consistent with known physics from
theoretical particle physics to condensed matter. Here we provide additional
conceptual arguments in support to this novel unified scenario of quantum and
relativistic physics, potentially deterministic, and fully falsifiable having
no fine-tunable parameters. The first evidences of such new physics
characterized by ultra-fast cyclic time dynamics will be observed by probing
quantum phenomena with experimental time accuracy of the order of $10^{-21}$
$sec$. Considerations about the emergence of the arrow of time from the realm
of pure, zero temperature, quantum physics governed by intrinsic time
periodicity are also provided. Concerning Einstein's dilemma ""God does not play
dice"" we conclude that, all in all, ""God"" would have no fun playing quantum
dice.
