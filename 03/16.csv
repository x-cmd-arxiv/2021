  Trained Classifiers","Camera Ready ICML 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A discriminatively trained neural net classifier can fit the training data
perfectly if all information about its input other than class membership has
been discarded prior to the output layer. Surprisingly, past research has
discovered that some extraneous visual detail remains in the logit vector. This
finding is based on inversion techniques that map deep embeddings back to
images. We explore this phenomenon further using a novel synthesis of methods,
yielding a feedforward inversion model that produces remarkably high fidelity
reconstructions, qualitatively superior to those of past efforts. When applied
to an adversarially robust classifier model, the reconstructions contain
sufficient local detail and global structure that they might be confused with
the original image in a quick glance, and the object category can clearly be
gleaned from the reconstruction. Our approach is based on BigGAN (Brock, 2019),
with conditioning on logits instead of one-hot class labels. We use our
reconstruction model as a tool for exploring the nature of representations,
including: the influence of model architecture and training objectives
(specifically robust losses), the forms of invariance that networks achieve,
representational differences between correctly and incorrectly classified
images, and the effects of manipulating logits and images. We believe that our
method can inspire future investigations into the nature of information flow in
a neural net and can provide diagnostics for improving discriminative models.

proposed method uses the non-conforming and non-overlapping spectral
multidomain method with the temporal adaptation of the computational mesh.
Contrary to the existing multidomain spectral methods for reaction-diffusion
equations, the proposed multidomain spectral method solves the given PDEs in
each subdomain locally first and the boundary and interface conditions are
solved in a global manner. In this way, the method can be parallelizable and is

moments and lead to a surprisingly rich variety of their magnetic properties.
Typically MEIs can be estimated by fitting experimental results. But how many
MEIs need to be included in the fitting process for a material is not clear a
priori, which limits the quality of results obtained by these conventional
methods. In this paper, based on linear spin-wave theory but without performing
matrix diagonalization, we show that for a general quadratic spin Hamiltonian,
there is a simple relation between the Fourier transform of MEIs and the sum of
square of magnon energies (SSME). We further show that according to the
real-space distance range within which MEIs are considered relevant, one can
obtain the corresponding relationships between SSME in momentum space. We also
develop a theoretical tool for tabulating the rule about SSME. By directly
utilizing these characteristics and the experimental magnon energies at only a
few high-symmetry k points in the Brillouin zone, one can obtain strong
constraints about the range of exchange path beyond which MEIs can be safely
neglected. Our methodology is also general applicable for other Hamiltonian

control problems as the unique solution to a related Skorokhod reflection

discounted cost functional over an infinite time-horizon through a process of
bounded variation affecting an It\^o-diffusion. The setting is
multidimensional, the drift of the state equation and the costs are convex, the
volatility matrix can be constant or linear in the state. We prove that the
optimal control acts only when the underlying diffusion attempts to exit the
so-called waiting region, and that the direction of this action is prescribed
by the derivative of the value function. Our approach is based on the study of
a suitable monotonicity property of the derivative of the value function
through its interpretation as the value of an optimal stopping game. Such a
monotonicity allows to construct nearly optimal policies which reflect the
underlying diffusion at the boundary of approximating waiting regions. The
limit of this approximation scheme then provides the desired characterization.
Our result applies to a relevant class of linear-quadratic models, among

the goal shifted to controlling the peak of the infection, so as to minimize
the load on healthcare systems. To that end, public health authorities
intervened aggressively to institute social distancing, lock-down policies, and
other Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Given the high social,
educational, psychological, and economic costs of NPIs, authorities tune them,
alternatively tightening up or relaxing rules, with the result that, in effect,
a relatively flat infection rate results. For example, during the summer in
parts of the United States, daily infection numbers dropped to a plateau. This
paper approaches NPI tuning as a control-theoretic problem, starting from a
simple dynamic model for social distancing based on the classical SIR epidemics
model. Using a singular-perturbation approach, the plateau becomes a
Quasi-Steady-State (QSS) of a reduced two-dimensional SIR model regulated by
adaptive dynamic feedback. It is shown that the QSS can be assigned and it is
globally asymptotically stable. Interestingly, the dynamic model for social
distancing can be interpreted as a nonlinear integral controller. Problems of
data fitting and parameter identifiability are also studied for this model. The
paper also discusses how this simple model allows for meaningful study of the
effect of population size, vaccinations, and the emergence of second waves.

variability parameters between the two samples is clearly separated, with the
appearance of the BAL troughs being accompanied by the dimming of the continuum
and vice versa. Spectral index variations in the two samples also point to the
anti-correlation between the BAL trough and continuum variations consistent
with the ""bluer when brighter"" trend in quasars. We show that the intrinsic

absorption and emission lines, we find ubiquitous flows that differ from
stellar rotation by >100 km/s or have |v,abs - v,em| > 100 km/s. Inflows and
outflows extend toward the edge of the detected stellar disk/FOV, together
subtend 10-40% of the projected disk, and have similar mean N(NaI) and Weq(NaI

tend toward the projected major axis. The inflows may result from
non-axisymmetric potentials, tidal motions, or halo infall.

affected by choice of the variational ansatz used to represent the trial wave

research. Put another way, modern quantum computers are not capable of
executing deep quantum circuits produced by using currently available ansatze

the dataset is poorly sampled or imbalanced. Many available datasets in

difficult to train a high-performance model. Additionally, increasing the

classification algorithm that is extensible to any number of classes and can
handle an imbalance issue. The proposed method uses multiple autoencoders where
each one is trained on one class to extract features with the most
discrimination from other classes. The loss function of autoencoders is set
based on reconstruction, compactness, distance from other classes, and
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The extracted features are clustered and then
classified using an ensemble of support vector data descriptors. A total of
1,778 normal, 227 inflammation, 303 vascular, and 44 polyp images from the KID2

matter for a long time but the possibility has been poorly constrained over a
wide mass range, including the stellar mass range ($1-100~M_{\odot}$). However,
due to the discovery of merger events of black hole binaries by LIGO-Virgo
gravitational wave observatories, the interest for PBHs in the stellar mass
window has been aroused again. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio
transients with millisecond duration and very high all-sky occurrence rate.
Lensing effect of these bursts has been proposed as one of the optimal probes
for constraining the abundance of PBHs in the stellar mass range. In this
paper, we first investigate constraints on the abundance of PBHs from the
latest $593$ FRB observations for both the monochromatic mass distribution and
three other popular extended mass distributions related to different formation
mechanisms of PBHs. It is found that constraints from currently public FRB
observations are relatively weaker than those from existing gravitational wave
detections. Furthermore, we forecast constraining power of future FRB
observations on the abundance of PBHs with different mass distributions of PBHs
and different redshift distributions of FRBs taken into account. Finally, We
find that constraints of parameter space on extended mass distributions from
$\sim10^5$ FRBs with $\overline{\Delta t}\leq1 ~\rm ms$ would be comparable
with what can be constrained from gravitational wave events. It is foreseen
that upcoming complementary multi-messenger observations will yield
considerable constraints on the possibilities of PBHs in this intriguing mass
window.

purely spin-spin entanglement metrics such as mutual information and quantum

performance of a single device to the design of complex circuits combining
multiple transistors. In this work, we validate our scheme against experimental
results and exemplify its use and capability assessing the impact of the
channel scaling on the performance of MoS2-based FETs targeting RF
applications.

gravitational-wave backgrounds and to search for gravitational waves from point
sources. A spherical harmonic decomposition method is employed to look for
gravitational-wave emission from spatially-extended sources. Neither technique
found evidence of gravitational-wave signals. Hence we derive 95\%

interesting targets, Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A and the Galactic Center, with best
upper limits range from $h_0 < {\rm (1.7-2.1)} \times 10^{-25},$ a factor of

markets with quasi-linear utilities when every firm has negligible influence on

problems about the structural complexity of $\mathsf{BPTIME}$: proving
hierarchy theorems and showing the existence of complete problems. Our main
contributions can be summarised as follows.
  1. We build on techniques developed to prove hierarchy theorems for
probabilistic time with advice (Fortnow and Santhanam, FOCS 2004) to construct
the first unconditional pseudorandom generator of polynomial stretch computable
in pseudodeterministic polynomial time (with one bit of advice) that is secure
infinitely often against polynomial-time computations. As an application of
this construction, we obtain new results about the complexity of generating and
representing prime numbers.
  2. Oliveira and Santhanam (STOC 2017) established unconditionally that there
is a pseudodeterministic algorithm for the Circuit Acceptance Probability
Problem ($\mathsf{CAPP}$) that runs in sub-exponential time and is correct with
high probability over any samplable distribution on circuits on infinitely many
input lengths. We show that improving this running time or obtaining a result
that holds for every large input length would imply new time hierarchy theorems
for probabilistic time. In addition, we prove that a worst-case polynomial-time
pseudodeterministic algorithm for $\mathsf{CAPP}$ would imply that
$\mathsf{BPP}$ has complete problems.
  3. We establish an equivalence between pseudodeterministic construction of
strings of large $\mathsf{rKt}$ complexity (Oliveira, ICALP 2019) and the
existence of strong hierarchy theorems for probabilistic time.
  More generally, these results suggest new approaches for designing
pseudodeterministic algorithms for search problems and for unveiling the
structure of probabilistic time.

where $n$ is the flat band density and $\Omega$ the Marzari-Vanderbilt spread

quantum metric. For topological flat bands, with an obstruction to localized
WFs respecting all symmetries, we again obtain an upper bound for $D_{\rm low}$
linear in $|U|$. We discuss the insights obtained from our bounds by comparing
them with mean-field and quantum Monte-Carlo results.

differences in supporting evidence. We present VitaminC, a benchmark infused
with challenging cases that require fact verification models to discern and
adjust to slight factual changes. We collect over 100,000 Wikipedia revisions
that modify an underlying fact, and leverage these revisions, together with
additional synthetically constructed ones, to create a total of over 400,000

contrastive, i.e., they contain evidence pairs that are nearly identical in
language and content, with the exception that one supports a given claim while
the other does not. We show that training using this design increases
robustness -- improving accuracy by 10% on adversarial fact verification and 6%
on adversarial natural language inference (NLI). Moreover, the structure of
VitaminC leads us to define additional tasks for fact-checking resources:
tagging relevant words in the evidence for verifying the claim, identifying
factual revisions, and providing automatic edits via factually consistent text

Given these comparatively large vertical velocities, non-traditional rotation

  Here the effects of non-traditional rotation on a front in turbulent thermal
wind balance are considered using an asymptotic approach. Solutions are
presented for a general horizontal buoyancy profile and examined in the simple

layers of the graphene sheet are made of different magnetic materials. The
external magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the structure surface,

Hence, the graphene sheet has anisotropic conductivity tensor. A novel

differs from continuous control in that users are not assumed to use feedback
to adjust their movements continuously, but only when the difference between
the observed pointer position and predicted pointer positions become large. We
use a parameter optimisation approach to identify the parameters of an
intermittent controller from experimental data, where users performed
one-dimensional mouse movements in a reciprocal pointing task. Compared to
previous published work with continuous control models, based on the
Kullback-Leibler divergence from the experimental observations, IC is better
able to generatively reproduce the distinctive dynamical features and
variability of the pointing task across participants and over repeated tasks.
IC is compatible with current physiological and psychological theory and
provides insight into the source of variability in HCI tasks.

velocity gradients are obtained indirectly. Measurements are taken at various
downstream locations from the generating grid. Probability distribution
functions (PDFs) are calculated for the fluctuating component of the velocity,
the spatial velocity gradients and vorticity. The PDF of the velocity
fluctuations has a Gaussian distribution while velocity gradients and vorticity

investigated by calculating spatial autocorrelations for all measured and

untrusted channels. However, to achieve this goal, message authentication
considerably expands packet sizes, which is especially problematic in
constrained wireless environments. To address this issue, progressive message
authentication provides initially reduced integrity protection that is often
sufficient to process messages upon reception. This reduced security is then
successively improved with subsequent messages to uphold the strong guarantees
of traditional integrity protection. However, contrary to previous claims, we
show in this paper that existing progressive message authentication schemes are
highly susceptible to packet loss induced by poor channel conditions or jamming
attacks. Thus, we consider it imperative to rethink how authentication tags
depend on the successful reception of surrounding packets. To this end, we
propose R2-D2, which uses randomized dependencies with parameterized security
guarantees to increase the resilience of progressive authentication against
packet loss. To deploy our approach to resource-constrained devices, we
introduce SP-MAC, which implements R2-D2 using efficient XOR operations. Our
evaluation shows that SP-MAC is resilient to sophisticated network-level
attacks and operates as resources-conscious and fast as existing, yet insecure,
progressive message authentication schemes.

Moreover, we show that the right choice of solver parameterization can

recent years, publicly available medical datasets became a key factor to enable
reproducible development of diagnostic algorithms in the medical domain.
Medical data contains sensitive patient-related information and is therefore
usually anonymized by removing patient identifiers, e.g., patient names before
publication. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that a
well-trained deep learning system is able to recover the patient identity from
chest X-ray data. We demonstrate this using the publicly available large-scale
ChestX-ray14 dataset, a collection of 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images
from 30,805 unique patients. Our verification system is able to identify
whether two frontal chest X-ray images are from the same person with an AUC of
0.9940 and a classification accuracy of 95.55%. We further highlight that the
proposed system is able to reveal the same person even ten and more years after
the initial scan. When pursuing a retrieval approach, we observe an mAP@R of
0.9748 and a precision@1 of 0.9963. Furthermore, we achieve an AUC of up to
0.9870 and a precision@1 of up to 0.9444 when evaluating our trained networks
on external datasets such as CheXpert and the COVID-19 Image Data Collection.
Based on this high identification rate, a potential attacker may leak
patient-related information and additionally cross-reference images to obtain
more information. Thus, there is a great risk of sensitive content falling into
unauthorized hands or being disseminated against the will of the concerned
patients. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous chest X-ray
datasets have been published to advance research. Therefore, such data may be
vulnerable to potential attacks by deep learning-based re-identification

which the approach stands, and demonstrate that it provides one of the most
compact variational expansions to date for solving strongly correlated

geometrical interpretation, which provides conditions for the time evolution
grid in order to decouple eigenstates out of the set of time evolved expansion
states, and connects the method to the classical filter diagonalization
algorithm. Further, we introduce what we call the unitary formulation of VQPE,
in which the number of matrix elements that need to be measured scales linearly
with the number of expansion states, and we provide an analysis of the effects
of noise which substantially improves previous considerations. The unitary
formulation allows for a direct comparison to iterative phase estimation. Our
results mark VQPE as both a natural and highly efficient quantum algorithm for
ground and excited state calculations of general many-body systems. We
demonstrate a hardware implementation of VQPE for the transverse field Ising

of a Mott-insulating state away from half-filling. The filling-controlled Mott
insulator-metal transition, induced via charge-carrier doping, has been
extensively researched, but its governing mechanisms have yet to be fully
understood. Several theoretical proposals aimed to elucidate the nature of the
transition have been put forth, a notable one being phase separation and an
associated percolation-induced transition. In the present work, we study the
prototypical doped Mott-insulating rare-earth titanate YTiO$_3$, in which the
insulating state survives up to a large hole concentration of 35%. Single
crystals of Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TiO$_3$ with $0 \leq x \leq 0.5$, spanning the
insulator-metal transition, are grown and investigated. Using x-ray absorption
spectroscopy, a powerful technique capable of probing element-specific
electronic states, we find that the primary effect of hole doping is to induce
electronic phase separation into hole-rich and hole-poor regions. The data
reveal the formation of electronic states within the Mott-Hubbard gap, near the
Fermi level, which increase in spectral weight with increasing doping. From a
comparison with DFT+$U$ calculations, we infer that the hole-poor and hole-rich
components have charge densities that correspond to the Mott-insulating $x = 0$
and metallic $x \sim 0.5$ states, respectively, and that the new electronic
states arise from the metallic component. Our results indicate that the
hole-doping-induced insulator-metal transition in Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TiO$_3$ is
indeed percolative in nature, and thus of inherent first-order character.

each dish scans the sky independently. Operating in this mode allows extremely
high survey speeds to be achieved, albeit at significantly lower angular
resolution. We investigate the recovery of the baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO) scale from multipoles of the redshift-space correlation function as
measured by a low angular resolution 21cm intensity mapping survey of this

contamination and beam resolution effects, which we then use to generate an
ensemble of mock data vectors from which we attempt to recover the BAO scale.
In line with previous studies, we find that recovery of the transverse BAO
scale $\alpha_{\perp}$ is hampered by the strong smoothing effect of the
instrumental beam with increasing redshift, while the radial scale
$\alpha_\parallel$ is much more robust. The multipole formalism naturally
incorporates transverse information when it is available however, and so there
is no need to perform a radial-only analysis. In particular, the quadrupole of
the correlation function preserves a distinctive BAO `bump' feature even for
large smoothing scales. We also investigate the robustness of BAO scale
recovery to beam model accuracy, severity of the foreground removal cuts, and
accuracy of the covariance matrix model, finding in all cases that the radial
BAO scale can be recovered in an accurate, unbiased manner.

very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) can be used to identify compact
emission that can only be attributed to AGN activity.
  This is the second in a series of papers dealing with the compact radio
population in the GOODS-N field. We review 14 different AGN classification
techniques in the context of a VLBI-detected sample, and use these to
investigate the nature of the AGN as well as their host galaxies.
  We find that no single identification technique can identify all VLBI objects
as AGN. Infrared colour-colour selection is most notably incomplete. However,
the usage of multiple classification schemes can identify all VLBI-selected
AGN, independently verifying similar approaches used in other deep field
surveys. In the era of large area surveys with instruments such as the SKA and
ngVLA, multi-wavelength coverage, which relies heavily upon observations from
space, is often unavailable. Therefore, VLBI remains an integral component in
detecting AGN of the jetted efficient and inefficient accretion types. A
substantial fraction (46%) of the VLBI AGN have no X-ray counterpart, which is
most likely due to lack of sensitivity in the X-ray band. A high fraction of
the VLBI AGN reside in low or intermediate redshift dust-poor early-type
galaxies. These most likely exhibit inefficient accretion. Finally, a
significant fraction of the VLBI AGN reside in symbiotic dusty starburst - AGN
systems. We present an extensive compilation of the multi-wavelength properties
of all the VLBI-selected AGN in GOODS-N in the Appendix.

  Channel Balances","16 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The Lightning Network (LN) is a prominent payment channel network aimed at
addressing Bitcoin's scalability issues. Due to the privacy of channel
balances, senders cannot reliably choose sufficiently liquid payment paths and
resort to a trial-and-error approach, trying multiple paths until one succeeds.
This leaks private information and decreases payment reliability, which harms
the user experience. This work focuses on the reliability and privacy of LN
payments. We create a probabilistic model of the payment process in the LN,
accounting for the uncertainty of the channel balances. This enables us to
express payment success probabilities for a given payment amount and a path.
Applying negative Bernoulli trials for single- and multi-part payments allows
us to compute the expected number of payment attempts for a given amount,
sender, and receiver. As a consequence, we analytically derive the optimal
number of parts into which one should split a payment to minimize the expected
number of attempts. This methodology allows us to define service level
objectives and quantify how much private information leaks to the sender as a
side effect of payment attempts. We propose an optimized path selection
algorithm that does not require a protocol upgrade. Namely, we suggest that
nodes prioritize paths that are most likely to succeed while making payment
attempts. A simulation based on the real-world LN topology shows that this
method reduces the average number of payment attempts by 20% compared to a
baseline algorithm similar to the ones used in practice. This improvement will
increase to 48% if the LN protocol is upgraded to implement the channel
rebalancing proposal described in BOLT14.

of the direct effect of the antibiotic-cargo released from MSNs on
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial biofilms. Levofloxacin (LVX),
gentamicin (GM) and rifampin (RIF) were separately loaded into pure-silica and
amino-modified MSNs. This accounts for the versatility of these nanosystems
since they were able to load and release different antibiotic molecules of
diverse chemical nature. Biological activity curves of the released antibiotic
were determined for both bacterial strains, which allowed to calculate the
active doses that are effective against bacterial biofilms. Furthermore, in
vitro biocompatibility assays on osteoblast-like cells were carried out at
different periods of times. Albeit a slight decrease in cell viability was
observed at the very initial stage, due to the initial burst antibiotic
release, the biocompatibility of these nanosystems is evidenced since a
recovery of cell viability was achieved after 72 h of assay. Biological
activity curves for GM released from MSNs exhibited sustained patterns and
antibiotic doses in the 2-6 {\mu}g/mL range up to 100 h, which were not enough
to eradicate biofilm. In the case of LVX and RIF first-order kinetics featuring
an initial burst effect followed by a sustained release above the MIC up to 96
h were observed. Such doses reduced by 99.9% bacterial biofilm and remained
active up to 72 h with no emergence of bacterial resistance.

of low-energy cosmic rays (CRs; < 1 TeV) in shocks situated on the surface of a
protostar or along protostellar jets. These locally accelerated CRs offer an
attractive explanation for the high levels of non-thermal emission and
ionisation rate, $\zeta$, observed close to these sources. The high $\zeta$
observed in some protostellar sources is generally attributed to
shock-generated UV photons. The aim of this article is to show that when
synchrotron emission and a high $\zeta$ are measured in the same spatial
region, a locally shock-accelerated CR flux is sufficient to explain both
phenomena. We assume that relativistic particles are accelerated according to
the first-order Fermi acceleration mechanism and compute $\zeta$ and the
non-thermal emission at cm wavelengths. We then apply our model to the
star-forming region OMC-2 FIR 3/FIR 4. Using a Bayesian analysis, we constrain
the parameters of the model and estimate the spectral indices of the
non-thermal radio emission. We demonstrate that the local CR acceleration model
makes it possible to simultaneously explain the synchrotron emission along the
HOPS 370 jet within the FIR 3 region and $\zeta$ observed near the FIR 4
protocluster. Our model constrains the magnetic field strength
(~250-450$~\mu$G), its turbulent component (~20-40$~\mu$G), and the jet
velocity in the shock reference frame for the three non-thermal sources of the
HOPS 370 jet (~350-1000 km s$^{-1}$). Beyond the modelling of the OMC-2 FIR
3/FIR 4 system, we show how the combination of continuum observations at cm
wavelengths and molecular transitions is a powerful new tool for the analysis
of star-forming regions: these two types of observations can be simultaneously

constraints on various properties such as chemical abundances, cloud/haze
properties, and characteristic temperatures, at the day-night atmospheric
terminator. To date, most spectra have been observed for giant exoplanets due
to which retrievals typically assume H-rich atmospheres. However, recent
observations of mini-Neptunes/super-Earths, and the promise of upcoming
facilities including JWST, call for a new generation of retrievals that can
address a wide range of atmospheric compositions and related complexities. Here
we report Aurora, a next-generation atmospheric retrieval framework that builds
upon state-of-the-art architectures and incorporates the following key
advancements: a) a generalised compositional retrieval allowing for H-rich and
H-poor atmospheres, b) a generalised prescription for inhomogeneous
clouds/hazes, c) multiple Bayesian inference algorithms for high-dimensional
retrievals, d) modular considerations for refraction, forward scattering, and
Mie-scattering, and e) noise modeling functionalities. We demonstrate Aurora on
current and/or synthetic observations of hot Jupiter HD209458b, mini-Neptune
K218b, and rocky exoplanet TRAPPIST1d. Using current HD209458b spectra, we
demonstrate the robustness of our framework and cloud/haze prescription against
assumptions of H-rich/H-poor atmospheres, improving on previous treatments.
Using real and synthetic spectra of K218b, we demonstrate the agnostic approach
to confidently constrain its bulk atmospheric composition and obtain precise
abundance estimates. For TRAPPIST1d, 10 JWST NIRSpec transits can enable
identification of the main atmospheric component for cloud-free CO$_2$-rich and
N$_2$-rich atmospheres, and abundance constraints on trace gases including
initial indications of O$_3$ if present at enhanced levels ($\sim$10-100x Earth
levels).

O(few eV) and scintillating properties, are promising targets for detecting
dark matter of mass ~ O(few MeV). Additionally, their planar molecular
structures lead to large anisotropies in the electronic wavefunctions, yielding
a significant daily modulation in the event rate expected to be observed in
crystals of these molecules. We characterize the daily modulation rate of dark
matter interacting with an anisotropic scintillating organic crystal such as
trans-stilbene, and show that daily modulation is an ~ O(1) fraction of the
total rate for small DM masses and comparable to, or larger than, the ~ 10%
annual modulation fraction at large DM masses. As we discuss in detail, this
modulation provides significant leverage for detecting or excluding dark matter
scattering, even in the presence of a non-negligible background rate. Assuming
a non-modulating background rate of 1/min/kg that scales with total exposure,
we find that a 100 kg yr experiment is sensitive to the cross section

1.3-14 MeV (1.5-1000 MeV) if dark matter interacts via a heavy (light)

unitary is via the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. However, there is a large
class of possible decompositions for the infinitesimal time-evolution operator
as the order in which the Hamiltonian terms are implemented is arbitrary. We
introduce a novel perspective for generating a low-depth Trotter-Suzuki
decomposition assuming the standard Clifford+RZ gate set by adapting ideas from
quantum error correction. We map a given Trotter-Suzuki decomposition to a
constrained path on a graph which we deem the Pauli Frame Graph (PFG). Each
node of the PFG represents the set of possible Hamiltonian terms currently
available to be applied, Clifford operations represent a move from one node to
another, and so the graph distance represents the gate cost of implementing the
decomposition. The problem of finding the optimal decomposition is then
equivalent to solving a problem similar to the traveling salesman. Though this
is an NP-hard problem, we demonstrate the simplest heuristic, greedy search,
and compare the resulting two-qubit gate count and circuit depth to more
standard methods for a large class of scientifically relevant Hamiltonians,
both fermionic and bosonic, found in chemical, vibrational and condensed matter
problems which naturally scale. We find in nearly every case we study, the
resulting depth and two-qubit gate counts are less than those provided by
standard methods, by as much as an order of magnitude. We also find the method
is efficient and amenable to parallelization, making the method scalable for
problems of real interest.

within a planetary system are correlated. It is unknown how this
'peas-in-a-pod' phenomenon originates, whether it is in place at birth or
requires evolution, and whether it (initially) applies only to neighboring
planets or to all planets within a system. Here we address these questions by
making use of the recent discovery that planetary system architectures strongly
depend on ambient stellar clustering. Based on Gaia's second data release, we
divide the sample of planetary systems hosting multiple planets into those
residing in stellar position-velocity phase space overdensities and the field,
representing samples with elevated and low degrees of external perturbation,
respectively. We demonstrate that the peas-in-a-pod phenomenon manifests itself
in both samples, suggesting that the uniformity of planetary properties within
a system is not restricted to direct neighbors and likely already exists at
birth. The radius uniformity is significantly elevated in overdensities,
suggesting that it can be enhanced by evolutionary effects that either have a
similar impact on the entire planetary system or favour the retention of
similar planets. The mass uniformity may exhibit a similar, but weaker
dependence. Finally, we find ordering in both samples, with the planet radius
and mass increasing outwards. Despite its prevalence, the ordering is somewhat
weaker in overdensities, suggesting that it may be disrupted by external
perturbations arising from stellar clustering. We conclude that a comprehensive
understanding of the 'peas-in-a-pod' phenomenon requires linking planet
formation and evolution to the large-scale stellar and galactic environment.

strongly lensed quasars. In this work, we show that the transient nature of the
point source provides an advantage over quasars: the lensed host galaxy can be
observed before or after the transient's appearance. Therefore, the lens model
can be derived from images free of contamination from bright point sources. We
quantify this advantage by comparing the precision of a lens model obtained
from the same lenses with and without point sources. Based on Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observations with the same sets of
lensing parameters, we simulate realistic mock datasets of 48 quasar lensing
systems (i.e., adding AGN in the galaxy center) and 48 galaxy-galaxy lensing
systems (assuming the transient source is not visible but the time delay and
image positions have been or will be measured). We then model the images and
compare the inferences of the lens model parameters and $H_0$. We find that the
precision of the lens models (in terms of the deflector mass slope) is better
by a factor of 4.1 for the sample without lensed point sources, resulting in an
increase of $H_0$ precision by a factor of 2.9. The opportunity to observe the
lens systems without the transient point sources provides an additional
advantage for time-delay cosmography over lensed quasars. It facilitates the
determination of higher signal-to-noise stellar kinematics of the main
deflector, and thus its mass density profile, which in turn plays a key role in
breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy and constraining $H_0$.

have a broad variety of dynamical mass-to-light ratios, ranging from dark
matter (DM) dominated systems to objects nearly devoid of DM. To investigate
the origin of this diversity, we develop a simple, semi-empirical model that
predicts the structural evolution of galaxies, driven by feedback from massive
star clusters, as a function of their departure from the mean SMHM relation.
The model predicts that a galaxy located $\gtrsim 0.5$ dex above the mean
relation at $M_{\rm halo}=10^{10}M_{\odot}$ will host a factor of $\sim 10-100$
larger globular cluster (GC) populations, and that feedback from these GCs
drives a significant expansion of the stellar component and loss of DM compared
to galaxies on the SMHM relation. This effect is stronger in haloes that
collapse earlier and have enhanced star formation rates at $z\gtrsim2$, which
leads to increased gas pressures, stellar clustering, and mean cluster masses,
and significantly enhances the energy loading of galactic winds and its impact
on the DM and stellar orbits. The impact on galaxy size and DM content can be
large enough to explain observed galaxies that contain nearly the universal
baryon fraction, as well as NGC1052-DF2 and DF4 and other isolated UDGs that
contain almost no DM. The trend of increasing galaxy size with GC specific
frequency observed in galaxy clusters also emerges naturally in the model. Our
predictions can be tested with large and deep surveys of the stellar and GC
populations in dwarfs and UDGs. Because stellar clustering drives the
efficiency of galactic winds, it may be a dominant factor in the structural
evolution of galaxies and should be included as an essential ingredient in
galaxy formation models.

qubits executing gates and measurements. Photonic qubits require a different
approach. In photonic fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC), the main hardware
components are resource-state generators (RSGs) and fusion devices connected
via waveguides and switches. RSGs produce small entangled states of a few
photonic qubits, whereas fusion devices perform entangling measurements between
different resource states, thereby executing computations. In addition,
low-loss photonic delays such as optical fiber can be used as fixed-time
quantum memories simultaneously storing thousands of photonic qubits. Here, we
present a modular architecture for FBQC in which these components are combined
to form ""interleaving modules"" consisting of one RSG with its associated fusion
devices and a few fiber delays. Exploiting the multiplicative power of delays,
each module can add thousands of physical qubits to the computational Hilbert

the fiber-delay loss. We illustrate how the combination of interleaving with
further uses of non-local fiber connections can reduce the cost of logical

probes the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of thermal dust emission in the rest-frame, and
can therefore be used as an estimate of the mass of the interstellar medium

redshifts with corresponding probability distribution functions derived from
deep 12-band photometry. With a sample approximately 2 orders of magnitude
larger than in previous works we significantly reduce statistical uncertainties
on $\rho_{\rm H_2}$ to $z\approx2.5$. Our measurements are in broad agreement

that the epoch of molecular gas coincides with the peak epoch of star formation
with $\rho_{\rm H_2}\approx2\times10^7\,{\rm M_\odot}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}}$ at

inverting the star-formation rate density with a fixed or weakly evolving
star-formation efficiency. This 'constant efficiency' model shows a similar
evolution to our statistically derived $\rho_{\rm H_2}$, indicating that the

about the saddle point, of a theory containing a sharp, critical Fermi surface
in two spatial dimensions. The theory describes the onset of Ising order in a
Fermi liquid, and closely related theories apply to other cases with critical
Fermi surfaces. We employ random couplings in flavor space between the fermions
and the bosonic order parameter, but there is no spatial randomness:
consequently, the $G$-$\Sigma$ path integral of the theory is expressed in
terms of fields bilocal in spacetime. The critical exponents of the large $N$
saddle-point are the same as in the well-studied non-random RPA theory; in
particular, the entropy density vanishes in the limit of zero temperature. We
present a full numerical solution of the large $N$ saddle-point equations, and
the results agree with the critical behavior obtained analytically. Following
analyses of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models, we describe scaling operators which
descend from fermion bilinears around the Fermi surface. This leads to a
systematic consideration of the role of time reparameterization symmetry, and
the scaling of the Cooper pairing and $2k_F$ operators which can determine
associated instabilities of the critical Fermi surface. We find no violations
of scaling from time reparameterizations. We also consider the same model but
with spatially random couplings: this provides a systematic large $N$ theory of
a marginal Fermi liquid with Planckian transport.

are too small, diffuse and dark to be visible, in any existing observations. In
this paper, we develop a complete formalism for weak and strong diffractive
lensing, which can be used to probe such subhalos with chirping gravitational
waves (GWs). Also, we show that Navarro-Frenk-White(NFW) subhalos in this mass
range can indeed be detected individually, albeit at a rate of ${\cal O}(10)$
or less per year at BBO and others limited by small merger rates and large
required SNR $\gtrsim 1/\gamma(r_0) \sim 10^3$. It becomes possible as NFW
scale radii $r_0$ are of the right size comparable to the GW Fresnel length
$r_F$, and unlike all existing probes, their lensing is more sensitive to
lighter subhalos. Remarkably, our formalism further reveals that the frequency
dependence of weak lensing (which is actually the detectable effect) is due to
shear $\gamma$ at $r_F$. Not only is it consistent with an approximate scaling
invariance, but it also offers a new way to measure the mass profile at a
successively smaller scale of chirping $r_F \propto f^{-1/2}$. Meanwhile,
strong diffraction that produces a blurred Einstein ring has a universal
frequency dependence, allowing only detections. These are further demonstrated
through semianalytic discussions of power-law profiles. Our developments for a
single lens can be generalized and will promote diffractive lensing to a more
concrete and promising physics in probing DM and small-scale structures.

different wavelength-dependent temperature profiles in the asymmetry of the
photothermal image point spread function. These point spread function
asymmetries are interpreted through companion numerical simulations of the
photothermal images to reveal how differing thermal gradients within the
nanorod trimer can be controlled by exciting its hybridized plasmonic modes. We
also find that hybrid plasmon modes that are optically dark can be excited by
our focused laser beam illumination geometry at certain beam positions, thereby
providing an additional route to modify thermal profiles at the nanoscale
beyond wide-field illumination. Taken together these findings demonstrate an
all-optical thermometry technique to actively create and measure thermal
gradients at the nanoscale below the diffraction limit.

this works in Walker-Wang codes, which provide a specific realization of these

with a trivial (paramagnetic) bulk that realizes a self correcting quantum

measure zero sub-volume of a three dimensional system can be sufficient to
stabilize a self correcting quantum memory at non-zero temperature.

$\sim124$ deg$^{2}$. Our sample covers a broad range of stellar masses and
photometric redshifts and enables a halo occupation distribution analysis to
study the redshift and stellar-mass dependence of dark halo properties of LRGs.
We find a tight correlation between the characteristic dark halo mass to host
central LRGs, $M_{\min}$, and the number density of LRGs independently of
redshifts, indicating that the formation of LRGs is associated with the global
environment. The $M_{\min}$ of LRGs depends only weakly on the stellar mass
$M_{\star}$ at $M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{10.75}h^{-2} M_{\odot}$ at $0.3<z<1.05$,
in contrast to the case for all photometrically selected galaxies for which
$M_{\min}$ shows significant dependence on $M_{\star}$ even at low $M_{\star}$.
The weak stellar mass dependence is indicative of the dark halo mass being the
key parameter for the formation of LRGs rather than the stellar mass. Our
result suggests that the halo mass of $\sim 10^{12.5 \pm 0.2}h^{-1} M_{\odot}$
is the critical mass for an efficient halo quenching due to the halo
environment. We compare our result with the result of the hydrodynamical
simulation to find that low-mass LRGs at $z \sim 1$ will increase their stellar
masses by an order magnitude from $z=1$ to $0$ through mergers and satellite
accretions, and a large fraction of massive LRGs at $z<0.9$ consist of LRGs

simple arguments based on the S-procedure lead to a very effective controller
design through a convex program. Specifically, the feasible set of the latter

vacuum state in time according to the rules of a given model. Since the only
observables are the future values of correlators and not their time evolution,
this brings about a large degeneracy: a vast number of different models are
mapped to the same minute number of observables. Furthermore, due to the lack
of time-translation invariance, even tree-level calculations require an
increasing number of nested integrals that quickly become intractable. Here we
ask how much of the final observables can be ""bootstrapped"" directly from
locality, unitarity and symmetries.
  To this end, we introduce two new bootstrap tools to efficiently compute
cosmological correlators/wavefunctions. The first is a Manifestly Local Test
(MLT) that any $n$-point (wave)function of massless scalars or gravitons must
satisfy if it is to arise from a manifestly local theory. When combined with a
sub-set of the recently proposed Bootstrap Rules, this allows us to compute
explicitly all bispectra to all orders in derivatives for a single scalar.
Since we don't invoke soft theorems, this can also be extended to multi-field
inflation. The second is a partial energy recursion relation that allows us to
compute exchange correlators. Combining a bespoke complex shift of the partial
energies with Cauchy's integral theorem and the Cosmological Optical Theorem,
we fix exchange correlators up to a boundary term. The latter can be determined
up to contact interactions using unitarity and manifest locality. As an
illustration, we use these tools to bootstrap scalar inflationary trispectra
due to graviton exchange and inflaton self-interactions.

algebraic scaling laws, determined by the dimensionality and the underlying

show that, by changing the dimensionality and the symmetries of the electronic

guided differential fuzz testing. Guided by the distance between query
hypervector and reference hypervector in HDC, HDTest continuously mutates
original inputs to generate new inputs that can trigger incorrect behaviors of

example, we show that HDTest can generate thousands of adversarial inputs with
negligible perturbations that can successfully fool HDC models. On average,
HDTest can generate around 400 adversarial inputs within one minute running on

series, developed between January and August 2020. We use the number of
confirmed dengue cases and residential mobility, on a daily basis, from
secondary information sources. Mobility was represented by the daily percentage
variation of residential population isolation, obtained from the Google

distancing by negative binomial regression, adjusted for seasonality. We
represent the social distancing dichotomously (isolation versus no isolation)
and consider lag for isolation from the dates of occurrence of dengue. Results:
The risk of dengue decreased around 9.1% (95% CI: 14.2 to 3.7) in the presence

referred to as Fuzzy Dark Matter, are well-motivated in many theories beyond
the Standard Model and could potentially solve the $\Lambda$CDM small-scale

structures in the Universe. Their distribution in mass and redshift is strongly
sensitive to the underlying linear matter perturbations. In this forecast paper
we explore two scenarios, firstly an exclusion limit on axion mass given a
no-axion model and secondly constraints on an axion model. With this we obtain
lower limits on the ULA mass on the order of $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-24}$ eV.
However, this result depends heavily on the mass of the smallest reliably
observable clusters for a given survey. Cluster counts, like many other
cosmological probes, display an approximate degeneracy in the ULA mass vs.
abundance parameter space, which is dependent on the characteristics of the
probe. These degeneracies are different for other cosmological probes. Hence
galaxy cluster counts might provide a complementary window on the properties of
ultra-light axions.

the small oscillator strengths and corresponding optical responses of the

radiative lifetimes in the range of 5-200\,ns (at T=4\,K) for the 'bright'
interlayer excitons. Solving the finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter Equation, we
predict that the lowest-energy excitation should be an indirect exciton over
the fundamental indirect band gap (K$\rightarrow$Q), with a binding energy of
220\,meV. However, in agreement with recent magneto-optics experiments and
previous theoretical studies, our simulations of the effective excitonic

X-ray cavities, and we unveil the presence of two prominent cold fronts at
$\sim$60 kpc and $\sim$178 kpc from the center, located along a cold ICM spiral
feature. The central galaxy, which is offset by 17.7 kpc from the X-ray peak,
is surrounded by a multi-temperature gas with an average density of
$n_{\text{e}} = 2.14 \times 10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$. We find extended radio emission

comprehensive contact tracing network analysis to find an optimized quarantine

datapoints from a compilation of hundreds of mobile apps deployed in Latin

mobility across the region decreases by $\sim$53\%, which results in a drastic
disintegration of the transmission network by $\sim$90\%. However, this
disintegration did not halt the spreading of the disease. Our analysis
indicates that superspreading k-core structures persist in the transmission
network to prolong the pandemic. Once the k-cores are identified, an optimized
strategy to break the chain of transmission is to quarantine a minimal number
of 'weak links' with high betweenness centrality connecting the large k-cores.
As countries built contact tracing apps to fight the pandemic, our results
could turn into a valuable resource to help deploy quarantine protocols with

lines are generic features of a variety of lens models, and are regions in

intensity modulation of lensed sources. Using the mathematical framework of
Picard-Lefschetz theory to compute diffraction integrals, we argue that these
imaginary images contain as much information as their geometric counterparts,

quasars and BL Lac objects. We present multi-wavelength photometric and
spectroscopic monitoring observations of the blazar, B2 1420+32, focusing on
its outbursts in 2018-2020. Multi-epoch spectra show that the blazar exhibited
large scale spectral variability in both its continuum and line emission,
accompanied by dramatic gamma-ray and optical variability by factors of up to
40 and 15, respectively, on week to month timescales. Over the last decade, the
gamma-ray and optical fluxes increased by factors of 1500 and 100,
respectively. B2 1420+32 was an FSRQ with broad emission lines in 1995.
Following a series of flares starting in 2018, it transitioned between BL Lac
and FSRQ states multiple times, with the emergence of a strong Fe pseudo
continuum. Two spectra also contain components that can be modeled as
single-temperature black bodies of 12,000 and 5,200 K. Such a collection of
""changing look"" features has never been observed previously in a blazar. We
measure gamma-ray-optical and the inter-band optical lags implying emission
region separations of less than 800 and 130 gravitational radii respectively.
Since most emission line flux variations, except the Fe continuum, are within a
factor of 2-3, the transitions between FSRQ and BL Lac classifications are
mainly caused by the continuum variability. The large Fe continuum flux
increase suggests the occurrence of dust sublimation releasing more Fe ions in
the central engine and an energy transfer from the relativistic jet to
sub-relativistic emission components.

signals are independently drawn from a sparse, multivariate Poisson
distribution. We are primarily motivated by a suite of biosensing applications
of microfluidics where analytes (such as whole cells or biomarkers) are
captured in small volume partitions according to a Poisson distribution. We
recover the sparse parameter vector of Poisson rates through maximum likelihood
estimation with our novel Sparse Poisson Recovery (SPoRe) algorithm. SPoRe uses
batch stochastic gradient ascent enabled by Monte Carlo approximations of
otherwise intractable gradients. By uniquely leveraging the Poisson structure,
SPoRe substantially outperforms a comprehensive set of existing and custom
baseline CS algorithms. Notably, SPoRe can exhibit high performance even with
one-dimensional measurements and high noise levels. This resource efficiency is
not only unprecedented in the field of CS but is also particularly potent for
applications in microfluidics in which the number of resolvable measurements
per partition is often severely limited. We prove the identifiability property

benchmark this model, we first evaluate the band properties of an infinite T2SL
with periodic boundary conditions, employing the envelope function
approximation with a finite-difference discretization within the perturbative
eight-band $\bf{k.p}$ framework. The strong dependence of the constituent
material layer thicknesses on the band-edge positions and effective masses
offers a primary guideline to design performance-specific detectors for a wide
range of operations. Moving forward, we demonstrate that using a finite T2SL
structure in the Green's function framework, one can estimate the bandgap,
band-offsets, density of states, and spatial overlap which comply well with the
$\bf{k.p}$ results and the experimental data. Finally, the superiority of this

privately answer numerical queries, which is usually achieved by adding noise
to the answer vector. The central question, therefore, is to understand which
noise distribution optimizes the privacy-accuracy trade-off, especially when
the dimension of the answer vector is high. Accordingly, extensive literature
has been dedicated to the question and the upper and lower bounds have been
matched up to constant factors [BUV18, SU17]. In this paper, we take a novel
approach to address this important optimality question. We first demonstrate an
intriguing central limit theorem phenomenon in the high-dimensional regime.
More precisely, we prove that a mechanism is approximately Gaussian
Differentially Private [DRS21] if the added noise satisfies certain conditions.
In particular, densities proportional to $\mathrm{e}^{-\|x\|_p^\alpha}$, where
$\|x\|_p$ is the standard $\ell_p$-norm, satisfies the conditions. Taking this
perspective, we make use of the Cramer--Rao inequality and show an ""uncertainty

$\ell_2$-loss of the mechanism is lower bounded by the dimension. Furthermore,
the Gaussian mechanism achieves the constant-sharp optimal privacy-accuracy

polarization changes upon ligand transfer from water to the protein interior,
leading to inaccurate prediction of binding affinities for charged molecules.
Here, we perform extensive simulation totaling ~540 $\mu$s to benchmark the
impact of modeling conditions on predictive accuracy for absolute alchemical
simulations. Binding to urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA), a protein
frequently overexpressed in metastatic tumors, is evaluated for a set of ten

policy to select an optimal band subset without any hand-engineered reasoning.
To this end, we frame the problem of unsupervised band selection as a Markov

solve the problem by deep reinforcement learning. Once the agent is trained, it
learns a band-selection policy that guides the agent to sequentially select
bands by fully exploiting the hyperspectral image and previously picked bands.
Furthermore, we propose two different reward schemes for the environment

  The strong parallel repetition problem for unique games is to efficiently
reduce the 1-delta vs. 1-C*delta gap problem of Boolean unique games (where C>1
is a sufficiently large constant) to the 1-epsilon vs. epsilon gap problem of
unique games over large alphabet. Due to its importance to the Unique Games
Conjecture, this problem garnered a great deal of interest from the research
community. There are positive results for certain easy unique games (e.g.,
unique games on expanders), and an impossibility result for hard unique games.
  In this paper we show how to bypass the impossibility result by enlarging the
alphabet sufficiently before repetition. We consider the case of unique games
on small set expanders for two setups: (i) Strong small set expanders that
yield easy unique games. (ii) Weaker small set expanders underlying possibly
hard unique games as long as the game is mildly fortified. We show how to
fortify unique games in both cases, i.e., how to transform the game so
sufficiently large induced sub-games have bounded value. We then prove strong
parallel repetition for the fortified games. Prior to this work fortification
was known for projection games but seemed hopeless for unique games.

factors provide one general way to compare different hypotheses by their
compatibility with the observed data. Those quantifications can then also be
used to choose between hypotheses. While Bayes factors provide an immediate
approach to hypothesis testing, they are highly sensitive to details of the
data/model assumptions. Moreover it's not clear how straightforwardly this
approach can be implemented in practice, and in particular how sensitive it is
to the details of the computational implementation. Here, we investigate these
questions for Bayes factor analyses in the cognitive sciences. We explain the
statistics underlying Bayes factors as a tool for Bayesian inferences and
discuss that utility functions are needed for principled decisions on
hypotheses. Next, we study how Bayes factors misbehave under different
conditions. This includes a study of errors in the estimation of Bayes factors.
Importantly, it is unknown whether Bayes factor estimates based on bridge
sampling are unbiased for complex analyses. We are the first to use
simulation-based calibration as a tool to test the accuracy of Bayes factor
estimates. Moreover, we study how stable Bayes factors are against different
MCMC draws. We moreover study how Bayes factors depend on variation in the
data. We also look at variability of decisions based on Bayes factors and how
to optimize decisions using a utility function. We outline a Bayes factor
workflow that researchers can use to study whether Bayes factors are robust for
their individual analysis, and we illustrate this workflow using an example
from the cognitive sciences. We hope that this study will provide a workflow to
test the strengths and limitations of Bayes factors as a way to quantify
evidence in support of scientific hypotheses. Reproducible code is available

projection-based (range-view or birds-eye-view), and voxel-based approaches.
However, they either abandon the valuable 3D topology and geometric relations

inefficient. Therefore, there is a need for accurate models capable of
processing the 3D driving-scene point cloud in 3D space. In this paper, we
propose S3Net, a novel convolutional neural network for LiDAR point cloud
semantic segmentation. It adopts an encoder-decoder backbone that consists of
Sparse Intra-channel Attention Module (SIntraAM), and Sparse Inter-channel
Attention Module (SInterAM) to emphasize the fine details of both within each

deeper layers, we introduce Sparse Residual Tower based upon sparse convolution
that suits varying sparsity of LiDAR point cloud. In addition, geo-aware
anisotrophic loss is leveraged to emphasize the semantic boundaries and
penalize the noise within each predicted regions, leading to a robust

leave its imprint on the light curve as a result of wind blanketing. We study
the photometric signatures of the line-driven wind instability. We used
line-driven wind instability simulations to determine the wind variability
close to the star. We applied two types of boundary perturbations: a sinusoidal
one that enables us to study in detail the development of the instability and a
stochastic one given by a Langevin process that provides a more realistic
boundary perturbation. We estimated the photometric variability from the
resulting mass-flux variations. The variability was simulated assuming that the
wind consists of a large number of independent conical wind sectors. We
compared the simulated light curves with TESS light curves of OB stars that
show stochastic variability. We find two typical signatures of line-driven wind
instability in photometric data: a knee in the power spectrum of magnitude
fluctuations, which appears due to engulfment of small-scale structure by
larger structures, and a negative skewness of the distribution of fluctuations,
which is the result of spatial dominance of rarefied regions. These features
endure even when combining the light curves from independent wind sectors. The
stochastic photometric variability of OB stars bears certain signatures of the
line-driven wind instability. The distribution function of observed photometric
data shows negative skewness and the power spectra of a fraction of light
curves exhibit a knee. This can be explained as a result of the line-driven
wind instability triggered by stochastic base perturbations.

It remains unknown how a system's layered architecture dictates its control
properties, particularly when control signals can only access the system

theory to probe the control properties of a duplex network with directed
interlayer links. We determine the manner in which the structural properties of
layers and relative interlayer arrangement together dictate the system's
response. For this purpose, we calculate the exact expression of optimal
control energy in terms of layer spectra and the relative alignment between the
eigenmodes of the input layer and the deeper target layer. For a range of
numerically constructed duplex networks, we then calculate the control
properties of the two layers as a function of target-layer densities and layer
topology. The alignment of layer eigenmodes emerges as an important parameter
that sets the cost and routing of the optimal energy for control. We understand
these results in a simplified limit of a single-mode approximation, and we
build metrics to characterize the routing of optimal control energy through the
eigenmodes of each layer. Our analytical and numerical results together provide
insights into the relationships between structure and control in duplex

estimate dense (per-pixel)-but generally less robust-flows, mostly using
computationally costly algorithms. Instead, we propose a lightweight flow

the flow information. Building on top of the flow estimation, we demonstrate a
general framework that integrates the flows in a plug-and-play fashion with

interaction originates from repulsion-assisted scattering between far-out pair

bandstructure design and carrier density in order to bring plasma frequency
below the bandgap renders the repulsion unscreened for the processes with a
large frequency transfer. This allows the pairing to fully benefit from the
pristine Coulomb repulsion strength. The repulsion-induced attraction is
particularly strong in two dimensions and is assisted by a low density of
carriers and the resulting low plasma frequency values. We assess the possible
connection of this mechanism to superconductivity in magic-angle twisted

also present historical IR light curves taken between 1983 July and 1989 May,
which show variability consistent with the period of the present-day light

amplitudes than the present-day PGIR values, suggesting that NaSt1 exhibits
variability on longer ($\gtrsim$ decade) timescales. Sinusoidal fits to the
recent optical and IR light curves show that the amplitude of NaSt1's
variability differs at various wavelengths and also reveal significant phase
offsets of $17.0\pm2.5$ d between the ZTF $r$ and PGIR $J$ light curves. We

circumstellar optical/IR emitting regions throughout its orbit due to
colliding-wind dust formation. We speculate that past mass transfer in NaSt1

induced interaction between the impurities at arbitrary coupling and separation
$r$. At $r\lesssim \xi$, where $\xi$ denotes the healing length of the Bose
gas, the interaction is well described by the mean-field contribution. Its form
changes as the coupling is increased, approaching a linear function of $r$ at
short distances in the regime of strong coupling. The mean-field contribution
decays exponentially at arbitrary coupling for $r\gg\xi$. At such long
distances, however, the effect of quantum fluctuations becomes important,
giving rise to a long-ranged quantum contribution to the induced interaction.
At longest distances it behaves as $1/r^3$, while at strong coupling we find an
intermediate distance regime with a slower decay, $1/r$. The quantum
contribution in the crossover regime is also calculated. The induced
interaction between impurities (i.e., polarons) is attractive and leads to the
formation of their bound state, known as bipolaron. We discuss its binding
energy.

is employed as the front-end for extracting target speaker from its mixture
with interfering speakers and environmental noises. Compared with the
conventional target speaker enhancement models, nontarget speaker/interference
suppression should draw additional attention for SV. Therefore, an effective
nontarget speaker sampling strategy is explored. To improve speaker embedding
extraction with a light-weighted model, a teacher-student (T/S) training is
proposed to distill speaker discriminative information from large models to
small models. Iterative inference is investigated to address the noisy speaker
enrollment problem. We evaluate the proposed method on two SV tasks, i.e., one

When applied to real-life applications, such latency and computation demand
severely deter the practical use of pre-trained models. In this paper, we study
Image-text retrieval (ITR), the most mature scenario of V+L application, which
has been widely studied even prior to the emergence of recent pre-trained

accelerates the inference time of ITR by thousands of times, without
sacrificing accuracy. LightningDOT removes the time-consuming cross-modal
attention by pre-training on three novel learning objectives, extracting
feature indexes offline, and employing instant dot-product matching with
further re-ranking, which significantly speeds up retrieval process. In fact,
LightningDOT achieves new state of the art across multiple ITR benchmarks such

the following planets could be losing their atmospheres today at a rate

monotonously decreases with increasing the saturation of intermediate-wetting
fluid, while the other two specific interfacial lengths exhibit a
non-monotonous variation. As the wetting (non-wetting) fluid becomes less
wetting (non-wetting), the relative permeability of wetting fluid monotonously
increases, while the other two relative permeabilities show a non-monotonous

between wetting and non-wetting fluids always stabilizes at a low level. As the

""spiral spin liquid"", while faster fluctuations echo the U(1) spin liquid found

argue that these are a distinguishing feature of the spin liquid in the BBK
model.

moves closer to the X-ray source. In parallel, the peak of the iron line shifts
from 6.5 to ~7 keV, becoming consistent with that expected of from a highly

with a source term, we establish the global in time existence and uniqueness of
analytic solutions to the two dimensional (2D) MHD boundary layer equations. It
is noted that the far-field state of velocity is not required to be small
initially, but decays to zero as time tends to infinity with suitable decay
rates. The whole analysis is divided into two parts: When the initial far-field
states are not small, we reformulate the original problem into a small
perturbation problem by extracting a suitable background profile which is
governed by a heat equation, then we prove a long-time existence of solutions,

combining the decay properties of far-field state and the properties of

of dollars annually in healthcare, lost workplace productivity, and crime.
Analyzing longitudinal healthcare data is critical in addressing many
real-world problems in healthcare. Leveraging the real-world longitudinal
healthcare data, we propose a novel multi-stream transformer model called MUPOD
for OUD identification. MUPOD is designed to simultaneously analyze multiple
types of healthcare data streams, such as medications and diagnoses, by
attending to segments within and across these data streams. Our model tested on
the data from 392,492 patients with long-term back pain problems showed
significantly better performance than the traditional models and recently
developed deep learning models.

Flows is a promising technique for unsupervised anomaly detection, but it can
fail at out-of-distribution detection since the likelihood is affected by the
smoothness of the data. To improve the detection performance, we train the
model to assign higher likelihood to target machine sounds and lower likelihood
to sounds from other machines of the same machine type. We demonstrate that
this enables the model to incorporate a self-supervised classification-based
approach. Experiments conducted using the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task2 dataset
showed that the proposed method improves the AUC by 4.6% on average when using
Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) and by 5.8% when using Glow, which is a

requires no additional type annotations. DDUO can be implemented as a library
for existing programming languages; we present a reference implementation in
Python which features moderate runtime overheads on realistic workloads. We
include support for several data types, distance metrics and operations which
are commonly used in modern machine learning programs. We also provide initial

with its albedo, non-gravitational acceleration, and lack of observed CO or CO2

belt objects (KBOs) would have generated and ejected ~10^14 collisional
fragments--roughly half of them H2O ice fragments and half of them N2 ice
fragments--due to the dynamical instability that depleted the primordial Kuiper
belt. We show consistency between these numbers and the frequency with which we
would observe interstellar objects like 1I/'Oumuamua, and more comet-like
objects like 2I/Borisov, if other stellar systems eject such objects with
efficiency like that of the Sun; we infer that differentiated KBOs and
dynamical instabilities that eject impact-generated fragments may be
near-universal among extrasolar systems. Galactic cosmic rays would erode such
fragments over 4.5 Gyr, so that fragments are a small fraction (~0.1%) of
long-period Oort comets, but C/2016 R2 may be an example. We estimate 'Oumuamua

Photonic Gap Antennas (PGAs) based on the dispersion relation of symmetric and
asymmetric horizontal slot-waveguides. To discuss the properties of PGAs, we
consider silicon pillars with air or CYTOP as the gap-material. We show by
full-wave simulations that PGAs with an emitter embedded in the gap can enhance
the spontaneous emission rate by a factor of $\sim$1000 for air gaps and
$\sim$400 for CYTOP gaps over a spectral bandwidth of $\Delta\lambda\approx300$
nm at $\lambda=1.25$ \textmu m. Furthermore, the PGAs can be designed to
provide unidirectional out-of-plane radiation across a substantial portion of
their spectral bandwidth. This is achieved by setting the position of the gap
at an optimized off-centered position of the pillar so as to properly break the
vertical symmetry of the structure. We also demonstrate that, when acting as

transform Ruelle's linear response formula into a well-conditioned

that is differentiable on the unstable manifold, which we assume to be
one-dimensional. This decomposition of Ruelle's formula ensures that one of the
resulting terms, the stable contribution, can be computed using a regularized
tangent equation, similar to in a non-chaotic system. The remaining term, known
as the unstable contribution, is regularized and converted into an efficiently
computable ergodic average. In this process, we develop new algorithms, which
may be useful beyond linear response, to compute i) a fundamental statistical
quantity we introduce called the density gradient, and ii) the unstable
derivatives of the regularized tangent vector field and the unstable direction.
We prove that the S3 algorithm, which combines these computational ingredients

misclassification once embedded. While they are inevitable, mis-recognizing
them as injected triggers causes false warnings in backdoor scanning. A
prominent challenge is hence to distinguish natural features and injected
backdoors. We develop a novel symmetric feature differencing method that
identifies a smallest set of features separating two classes. A backdoor is
considered injected if the corresponding trigger consists of features different
from the set of features distinguishing the victim and target classes. We
evaluate the technique on thousands of models, including both clean and
trojaned models, from the TrojAI rounds 2-4 competitions and a number of models
on ImageNet. Existing backdoor scanning techniques may produce hundreds of
false positives (i.e., clean models recognized as trojaned). Our technique
removes 78-100% of the false positives (by a state-of-the-art scanner ABS) with
a small increase of false negatives by 0-30%, achieving 17-41% overall accuracy
improvement, and facilitates achieving top performance on the leaderboard. It
also boosts performance of other scanners. It outperforms false positive
removal methods using L2 distance and attribution techniques. We also
demonstrate its potential in detecting a number of semantic backdoor attacks.

  $(^3\text{He},d)$ Proton Transfer Reactions","PhD thesis, 2021",,,,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Globular clusters are dense aggregates of stars that evolve in relative
isolation. For the better part of $40$ years these clusters have been known to
possess unique chemical signatures called abundance anomalies. Recent
observations have found these abundance anomalies to be the result of distinct
stellar populations with the youngest population undergoing an unknown
enrichment process. Understanding these chemical signatures requires a precise
understanding of the thermonuclear reaction rates at relatively low
temperatures. At these low temperatures reaction rates suffer from large
uncertainties arising from poorly understood resonances in several key
reactions. Transfer reactions provide key constrains on nuclear inputs for
these resonances. This thesis presents an updated understanding of the sodium
and potassium destroying reactions $^{23}$Na$(p, \gamma)$ and $^{39}$K$(p,
\gamma)$, respectively. A reevaluated rate for $^{39}$K$(p, \gamma)$ indicates
that it is less precisely known than previously thought, and future
experimental study is needed to reduce its impact on globular cluster
nucleosynthesis. Novel Bayesian techniques assess the uncertainties arising
from transfer measurements. These techniques are applied to the transfer
reaction $^{23}$Na$(^3\text{He}, d)$, which was carried out at Triangle
Universities Nuclear Laboratory. Results of this experiment indicate that the
energy of an important resonance in $^{23}$Na$(p, \gamma)$ is much lower than
previously thought at $E_r =132(3)$ keV. The transfer measurement also
indicates tension between previous direct studies of the resonance strength and
the current transfer measurement. The impact of these uncertainties on the
$^{23}$Na$(p, \gamma)$ reaction rate is investigated, and it is shown that this
rate requires more intensive study to provide the precision needed to constrain
nucleosynthesis in globular clusters.

neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance of node
classification. However, existing GNNs address the problem where node samples
for different classes are balanced; while for many real-world scenarios, some
classes may have much fewer instances than others. Directly training a GNN
classifier in this case would under-represent samples from those minority
classes and result in sub-optimal performance. Therefore, it is very important
to develop GNNs for imbalanced node classification. However, the work on this
is rather limited. Hence, we seek to extend previous imbalanced learning
techniques for i.i.d data to the imbalanced node classification task to
facilitate GNN classifiers. In particular, we choose to adopt synthetic
minority over-sampling algorithms, as they are found to be the most effective
and stable. This task is non-trivial, as previous synthetic minority
over-sampling algorithms fail to provide relation information for newly
synthesized samples, which is vital for learning on graphs. Moreover, node
attributes are high-dimensional. Directly over-sampling in the original input
domain could generates out-of-domain samples, which may impair the accuracy of
the classifier. We propose a novel framework, GraphSMOTE, in which an embedding
space is constructed to encode the similarity among the nodes. New samples are
synthesize in this space to assure genuineness. In addition, an edge generator
is trained simultaneously to model the relation information, and provide it for
those new samples. This framework is general and can be easily extended into
different variations. The proposed framework is evaluated using three different

of potential real-world applications. Graph is a natural structure for

intrinsic semantic changes of relationships in different scenarios. However,
despite its seemingly wide possibilities, usage of graph translation so far is
still quite limited. One important reason is the lack of high-quality paired
dataset. For example, we can easily build graphs representing peoples' shared
music tastes and those representing co-purchase behavior, but a well paired
dataset is much more expensive to obtain. Therefore, in this work, we seek to
provide a graph translation model in the semi-supervised scenario. This task is
non-trivial, because graph translation involves changing the semantics in the
form of link topology and node attributes, which is difficult to capture due to
the combinatory nature and inter-dependencies. Furthermore, due to the high
order of freedom in graph's composition, it is difficult to assure the
generalization ability of trained models. These difficulties impose a tighter
requirement for the exploitation of unpaired samples. Addressing them, we
propose to construct a dual representation space, where transformation is
performed explicitly to model the semantic transitions. Special encoder/decoder

to enforce the alignment of unpaired/paired examples. We evaluate the proposed

relationship to other concepts in the theory of quantum walks, set up a basic
theory, and discuss examples.
  Let $X$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A$ and consider quantum walks on
the vertex set $V(X)$ governed by the continuous time-dependent unitary
transition operator $U(t)= \exp(itA)$. For $S,T\subseteq V(X)$, we says $X$
admits ""group state transfer"" from $S$ to $T$ at time $\tau$ if the submatrix
of $U(\tau)$ obtained by restricting to columns in $S$ and rows not in $T$ is
the all-zero matrix. As a generalization of perfect state transfer, fractional
revival and periodicity, group state transfer satisfies natural monotonicity
and transitivity properties. Yet non-trivial group state transfer is still
rare; using a compactness argument, we prove that bijective group state
transfer (the optimal case where $|S|=|T|$) is absent for almost all $t$.
Focusing on this bijective case, we obtain a structure theorem, prove that
bijective group state transfer is ""monogamous"", and study the relationship
between the projections of $S$ and $T$ into each eigenspace of the graph.
  Group state transfer is obviously preserved by graph automorphisms and this
gives us information about the relationship between the setwise stabilizer of
$S\subseteq V(X)$ and the stabilizers of naturally defined subsets obtained by
spreading $S$ out over time and crudely reversing this process. These
operations are sufficiently well-behaved to give us a topology on $V(X)$ which
is likely to be simply the topology of subsets for which bijective group state
transfer occurs at that time. We illustrate non-trivial group state transfer in
bipartite graphs with integer eigenvalues, in joins of graphs, and in symmetric
double stars. The Cartesian product allows us to build new examples from old
ones.

an intelligent controller is designed based on sliding mode learning algorithm
that utilizes closed-loop error dynamics to learn the system behavior. The
controllers are working in parallel, and the intelligent controller can
gradually replace the feedback controller from the control of the system. In
addition to the stability of the sliding mode learning algorithm, the
closed-loop stability of an $n$th order feedback linearizable system is proven.
The simulation results demonstrate that CLELC algorithm can improve control
performance (e.g., smaller rise time, settling time and overshoot) in the
absence of uncertainties, and also provides robust control performance in the
presence of uncertainties as compared to traditional FLC method. To test the

organisms, which is formally called Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is
efficient in finding optimal policies for endowing complex systems with
sophisticated behavior. All paradigms of RL utilize a system model for finding
the optimal policy. Modeling dynamics can be done by formulating a mathematical
model or system identification. Dynamic models are usually exposed to aleatoric
and epistemic uncertainties that can divert the model from the one acquired and
cause the RL algorithm to exhibit erroneous behavior. Accordingly, the RL
process sensitive to operating conditions and changes in model parameters and
lose its generality. To address these problems, Intensive system identification
for modeling purposes is needed for each system even if the model dynamics
structure is the same, as the slight deviation in the model parameters can
render the model useless in RL. The existence of an oracle that can adaptively
predict the rest of the trajectory regardless of the uncertainties can help
resolve the issue. The target of this work is to present a framework for
facilitating the system identification of different instances of the same
dynamics class by learning a probability distribution of the dynamics
conditioned on observed data with variational inference and show its

representative example. We show that such quasicrystalline bilayer systems
generally develop macroscopically degenerate localized zero-energy states
(ZESs) in strong coupling limit where the interlayer couplings are
overwhelmingly larger than the intralayer couplings. The emergent chiral
symmetry in strong coupling limit and aperiodicity of bilayer quasicrystals
guarantee the existence of the ZESs. The macroscopically degenerate ZESs are
analogous to the flat bands of periodic systems, in that both are composed of
localized eigenstates, which give divergent density of states. For monolayers,
we consider the triangular, square, and honeycomb lattices, comprised of
homogenous tiling of three possible planar regular polygons: the equilateral
triangle, square, and regular hexagon. We construct a compact theoretical
framework, which we call the quasiband model, that describes the low energy
properties of bilayer quasicrystals and counts the number of ZESs using a
subset of Bloch states of monolayers. We also propose a simple geometric scheme

novel and essential relaxation technique to improve its accuracy and stability.
The EQ method has witnessed significant popularity in the past few years.
Though acknowledging its effectiveness in designing energy-stable schemes for

i.e., its preserves a ""modified"" energy law represented by auxiliary variables
instead of the original variables. Truncation errors are introduced during
numerical calculations so that the numerical solutions of the auxiliary
variables are no longer equivalent to their original continuous definitions.
Even though the ""modified"" energy dissipation law is preserved, the original
energy dissipation law is not guaranteed. In this paper, we overcome this issue
by introducing a relaxation technique. The computational cost of this extra
technique is negligible compared with the baseline EQ method. Meanwhile, the
relaxed-EQ method holds all the baseline EQ method's good properties, such as
linearity and unconditionally energy stability. Then we apply the relaxed-EQ
method to several widely-used phase field models to highlight its
effectiveness.

communication paradigms and information-centric networking (ICN). ICN
distributes the content among the users based on their trending requests. ICN
is responsible not only for the routing and caching but also for naming the
network's content. ICN considers several parameters such as cache-hit ratio,
content diversity, content redundancy, and stretch to route the content. ICN
enables name-based caching of the required content according to the user's
request based on the router's interest table. The stretch shows the path
covered while retrieving the content from producer to consumer. Reduction in
path length also leads to a reduction in end-to-end latency and better data
rate availability. ICN routers must have the minimum stretch to obtain a better
system efficiency. Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used in networks

three terminal nanowire-topological superconductor hybrid system are analyzed
in detail, in both the clean nanowire limit and in the presence of non-coherent
dephasing interactions. In the coherent transport regime for a clean wire, we
point out contributions of the local Andreev reflection and the non-local
transmissions toward the total conductance lineshapes while clarifying the role
of contact broadening on the Majorana conductance lineshapes at the magnetic
field parity crossings. Interestingly, at larger $B$-field parity crossings,
the contribution of the Andreev reflection process decreases which is
compensated by the non-local processes in order to maintain the conductance
quantum regardless of contact coupling strength. In the non-coherent transport
regime, we include dephasing that is introduced by momentum randomization
processes, that allows one to smoothly transition to the diffusive limit. Here,
as expected, we note that while the Majorana character of the zero modes is
unchanged, there is a reduction in the conductance peak magnitude that scales
with the strength of the impurity scattering potentials. Important distinctions
between the effect of non-coherent dephasing processes and contact-induced
tunnel broadenings in the coherent regime on the conductance lineshapes are
elucidated. Most importantly our results reveal that the addition of dephasing
in the set up does not lead to any notable length dependence to the conductance
of the zero modes, contrary to what one would expect in a gradual transition to
the diffusive limit. We believe this work paves a way for a systematic
introduction of scattering processes into the realistic modeling of Majorana
nanowire hybrid devices and assessing topological signatures in such systems in
the presence of non-coherent scattering processes.

the unexplored innermost regions. Based on the recent observations of ALMA/VLA
as well as theoretical predictions, we propose several intriguing topics in
massive star formation from the perspective of the ngVLA. In the disk scale of
$\lesssim$ 100 au around massive protostars, dust grains are expected to be
destructed/sublimated because the physical conditions of temperature, shocks,
and radiation are much more intense than those in the envelopes, which are
typically observed as hot cores. The high sensitivity and resolution of the
ngVLA will enable us to detect the gaseous refractories released by dust
destruction, e.g., SiO, NaCl, and AlO, which trace disk kinematics and give new
insights into the metallic elements in star-forming regions, i.e.,
astromineralogy. The multi-epoch survey by the ngVLA will provide demographics
of forming massive multiples with separations of $\lesssim$ 10 au with their
proper motion. Combining with observations of refractory molecular lines and
hydrogen recombination lines, we can reproduce the three-dimensional orbital
motions of massive proto-binaries. Moreover, the 1-mas resolution of the ngVLA
could possibly take the first-ever picture of the photospheric surface of an
accreting protostar, if it is bloated to the au scale by the high accretion
rates of mass and thermal energy.

  Adversarial Patches","9 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The security of object detection systems has attracted increasing attention,
especially when facing adversarial patch attacks. Since patch attacks change
the pixels in a restricted area on objects, they are easy to implement in the
physical world, especially for attacking human detection systems. The existing
defenses against patch attacks are mostly applied for image classification
problems and have difficulty resisting human detection attacks. Towards this
critical issue, we propose an efficient and effective plug-in defense component
on the YOLO detection system, which we name Ad-YOLO. The main idea is to add a
patch class on the YOLO architecture, which has a negligible inference
increment. Thus, Ad-YOLO is expected to directly detect both the objects of
interest and adversarial patches. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is
the first defense strategy against human detection attacks.
  We investigate Ad-YOLO's performance on the YOLOv2 baseline. To improve the
ability of Ad-YOLO to detect variety patches, we first use an adversarial
training process to develop a patch dataset based on the Inria dataset, which
we name Inria-Patch. Then, we train Ad-YOLO by a combination of Pascal VOC,
Inria, and Inria-Patch datasets. With a slight drop of $0.70\%$ mAP on VOC 2007
test set, Ad-YOLO achieves $80.31\%$ AP of persons, which highly outperforms
$33.93\%$ AP for YOLOv2 when facing white-box patch attacks. Furthermore,
compared with YOLOv2, the results facing a physical-world attack are also
included to demonstrate Ad-YOLO's excellent generalization ability.

low-resolution (LR) images lie in the same domain as the training ones. Due to
different lighting conditions and imaging hardware, domain gaps between
training and testing images inevitably occur in many real-world scenarios.
Neglecting those domain gaps would lead to inferior face super-resolution (FSR)
performance. However, how to transfer a trained FSR model to a target domain
efficiently and effectively has not been investigated. To tackle this problem,
we develop a Domain-Aware Pyramid-based Face Super-Resolution network, named
DAP-FSR network. Our DAP-FSR is the first attempt to super-resolve LR faces
from a target domain by exploiting only a pair of high-resolution (HR) and LR
exemplar in the target domain. To be specific, our DAP-FSR firstly employs its
encoder to extract the multi-scale latent representations of the input LR face.
Considering only one target domain example is available, we propose to augment
the target domain data by mixing the latent representations of the target
domain face and source domain ones, and then feed the mixed representations to
the decoder of our DAP-FSR. The decoder will generate new face images
resembling the target domain image style. The generated HR faces in turn are
used to optimize our decoder to reduce the domain gap. By iteratively updating
the latent representations and our decoder, our DAP-FSR will be adapted to the
target domain, thus achieving authentic and high-quality upsampled HR faces.
Extensive experiments on three newly constructed benchmarks validate the
effectiveness and superior performance of our DAP-FSR compared to the
state-of-the-art.

approach, however, entails high communication rates and latency because of the
computed gradients that need to be shared among nodes at every iteration. The
problem becomes more pronounced in the case that there is wireless
communication between the nodes (i.e. due to the limited network bandwidth). To
address this problem, various compression methods have been proposed including
sparsification, quantization, and entropy encoding of the gradients. Existing
methods leverage the intra-node information redundancy, that is, they compress
gradients at each node independently. In contrast, we advocate that the
gradients across the nodes are correlated and propose methods to leverage this
inter-node redundancy to improve compression efficiency. Depending on the node

because the Minkowski vacuum coincides with the vacuum state defined by the

questions, we need an accelerated observer having a vortex structure in the
transverse dimensions and carrying well-defined OAM. Here we consider the
angular momentum characteristics of Unruh effect in the theory of scalar field
and electromagnetic field for the first time. We find that the rotation and
vortex structure of a uniformly accelerated observer lead to the definite
angular momentum correlation between Rindler particles and their counterparts
in Minkowski vacuum. When interacting with the Unruh thermal bath, the
accelerated vortex observer carrying the OAM of l can absorb and emit Rindler
particles with the same OAM, and the particle energy is determined by the
angular velocity of the rotation. The absorption rate is not equal to the
emission rate in general. Both the absorption and emission processes in the
thermal bath are correlated with the emission process of particles with OAM of

not always perfect and the IoT operator may jeopardize the PNP's transmissions
due to misdetection. To reduce the possibility of such interferences, some of
the spectrum holes must remain unutilized, even when the IoT nodes have data to

spatial dependency networks (SDNs), feature maps at each level of a deep neural
net are computed in a spatially coherent way, using a sequential gating-based
mechanism that distributes contextual information across 2-D space. We show
that augmenting the decoder of a hierarchical VAE by spatial dependency layers
considerably improves density estimation over baseline convolutional
architectures and the state-of-the-art among the models within the same class.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SDN can be applied to large images by
synthesizing samples of high quality and coherence. In a vanilla VAE setting,
we find that a powerful SDN decoder also improves learning disentangled
representations, indicating that neural architectures play an important role in
this task. Our results suggest favoring spatial dependency over convolutional

combination of lower-order moments in wavenumber space. The closure
successfully reproduces the linear cyclotron resonance for electromagnetic
waves propagating parallel to the ambient magnetic field. In the presence of
finite temperature anisotropy, the model gives approximately correct prediction
for an instability destabilized via the cyclotron resonance. A nonlinear

to reduce the professional requirements and workload of robot programming, but
faces the challenges resulting from the differences between humans and robots.
Traditional optimization-based methods are time-consuming and rely heavily on
good initialization, while recent studies using feedforward neural networks
suffer from poor generalization to unseen motions. Moreover, they neglect the
topological information in human skeletons and robot structures. In this paper,
we propose a novel neural latent optimization approach to address these
problems. Latent optimization utilizes a decoder to establish a mapping between
the latent space and the robot motion space. Afterward, the retargeting results
that satisfy robot constraints can be obtained by searching for the optimal
latent vector. Alongside with latent optimization, neural initialization
exploits an encoder to provide a better initialization for faster and better
convergence of optimization. Both the human skeleton and the robot structure
are modeled as graphs to make better use of topological information. We perform
experiments on retargeting Chinese sign language, which involves two arms and
two hands, with additional requirements on the relative relationships among
joints. Experiments include retargeting various human demonstrations to YuMi,
NAO, and Pepper in the simulation environment and to YuMi in the real-world
environment. Both efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are verified.

obtain a robust sample of 46 CO(1-0) detections spanning $z=2.09-2.22$,

to date. The CO emitters show an overdensity at $z=2.12-2.21$, suggesting a
galaxy super-protocluster or a protocluster connected to large-scale filaments
with ~120 cMpc size. We find that 90% CO emitters have distances $>0'.5-4'$ to
the center galaxy, indicating that small area surveys would miss the majority
of gas reservoirs in similar structures. Half of the CO emitters have
velocities larger than escape velocities, which appears gravitationally unbound
to the cluster core. These unbound sources are barely found within the
$R_{200}$ radius around the center, which is consistent with a picture in which
the cluster core is collapsed while outer regions are still in formation.
Compared to other protoclusters, this structure contains relatively more CO
emitters with relatively narrow line width and high luminosity, indicating
galaxy mergers. We use these CO emitters to place the first constraint on the
CO luminosity function and molecular gas density in an overdense environment.
The amplitude of the CO luminosity function is 1.6$\pm$0.5 orders of magnitudes
higher than observed for field galaxy samples at $z\sim2$, and one order of
magnitude higher than predictions for galaxy protoclusters from semi-analytical
SHARK models. We derive a high molecular gas density of $0.6-1.3\times10^{9}$
$M_\odot$ cMpc$^{-3}$ for this structure, consistent with predictions for cold
gas density of massive structures from hydro-dynamical DIANOGA simulations.

(1) role-labeling: extracting keyphrases from users' utterances and classifying
them into a quadruple of coarsely-defined intent-roles via sequence labeling;
(2) concept-mining: clustering the extracted intent-role mentions and naming
them into abstract fine-grained concepts; (3) pattern-mining: applying the
Apriori algorithm to mine intent-role patterns and automatically inferring the
intent-slot using these coarse-grained intent-role labels and fine-grained

interstellar medium. This motivates the identification of a proxy that can be
readily observed from the ground. Here, we evaluate absorption in the
near-infrared 1083 nm triplet line of neutral orthohelium as a proxy for
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission in the 30.4 nm line of He II and 17.1 nm
line of Fe IX from the Sun. We apply deep learning to model the non-linear

classification, sentiment analysis and speech recognition is increasing. When
training DL models with large number of parameters and/or large datasets, cost
and speed of training can become prohibitive. Distributed DL training solutions
that split a training job into subtasks and execute them over multiple nodes
can decrease training time. However, the cost of current solutions, built
predominantly for cluster computing systems, can still be an issue. In contrast
to cluster computing systems, Volunteer Computing (VC) systems can lower the
cost of computing, but applications running on VC systems have to handle fault
tolerance, variable network latency and heterogeneity of compute nodes, and the
current solutions are not designed to do so. We design a distributed solution
that can run DL training on a VC system by using a data parallel approach. We
implement a novel asynchronous SGD scheme called VC-ASGD suited for VC systems.
In contrast to traditional VC systems that lower cost by using untrustworthy
volunteer devices, we lower cost by leveraging preemptible computing instances
on commercial cloud platforms. By using preemptible instances that require
applications to be fault tolerant, we lower cost by 70-90% and improve data
security.

components and the sparse tensor accounts for potential model
mis-specifications or heterogeneous signals that are unexplainable by the
low-rank part. The framework is flexible covering both linear and non-linear

fast algorithm by integrating the Riemannian gradient descent and a novel
gradient pruning procedure. Under suitable conditions, the algorithm converges
linearly and can simultaneously estimate both the low-rank and sparse tensors.
The statistical error bounds of final estimates are established in terms of the
gradient of loss function. The error bounds are generally sharp under specific
statistical models, e.g., the robust tensor PCA and the community detection in
hypergraph networks with outlier vertices. Moreover, our method achieves
non-trivial error bounds for heavy-tailed tensor PCA whenever the noise has a
finite $2+\varepsilon$ moment. We apply our method to analyze the international
trade flow dataset and the statistician hypergraph co-authorship network, both
yielding new and interesting findings.

However, the interplay between the prediction accuracy of the model and the

start by formally characterizing under which circumstances a predictive model
may benefit from algorithmic triage. In doing so, we also demonstrate that
models trained for full automation may be suboptimal under triage. Then, given
any model and desired level of triage, we show that the optimal triage policy
is a deterministic threshold rule in which triage decisions are derived
deterministically by thresholding the difference between the model and human
errors on a per-instance level. Building upon these results, we introduce a
practical gradient-based algorithm that is guaranteed to find a sequence of
triage policies and predictive models of increasing performance. Experiments on

devices, the number of vulnerabilities that threaten IIoT security is also
growing dramatically, including a mass of undisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities that
lack mitigation measures. Coordination Vulnerabilities Disclosure (CVD) is one
of the most popular vulnerabilities sharing solutions, in which some security
workers (SWs) can develop undisclosed vulnerabilities patches together.
However, CVD assumes that sharing participants (SWs) are all honest, and thus
offering chances for dishonest SWs to leak undisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities. To
combat such threats, we propose an Undisclosed IIoT Vulnerabilities Trusted
Sharing Protection (UIV-TSP) scheme with dynamic token. In this article, a
dynamic token is an implicit access credential for an SW to acquire an
undisclosed vulnerability information, which is only held by the system and
constantly updated as the SW access. Meanwhile, the latest updated token can be
stealthily sneaked into the acquired information as the traceability token.
Once the undisclosed vulnerability information leaves the SW host, the embedded
self-destruct program will be automatically triggered to prevent leaks since
the destination MAC address in the traceability token has changed. To quickly
distinguish dishonest SWs, trust mechanism is adopted to evaluate the trust
value of SWs. Moreover, we design a blockchain-assisted continuous logs storage
method to achieve the tamper-proofing of dynamic token and the transparency of
undisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities sharing. The simulation results indicate that
our proposed scheme is resilient to suppress dishonest SWs and protect the IoT
undisclosed vulnerabilities effectively.

optical clock that we have reported previously, the temperature of the
blackbody radiation (BBR) shield in vacuum has been reduced to 82(5) K using
liquid nitrogen. An ion trap with a lower heating rate and improved cooling
lasers were also introduced. This allows cooling the ion temperature to the
Doppler cooling limit during the clock operation, and the systematic
uncertainty due to the ion's secular (thermal) motion is reduced to < 1*10^-18.
The uncertainty due to the probe laser light shift and the servo error are also
reduced to < 1*10^-19 and 4*10^-19 with the hyper-Ramsey method and the
higher-order servo algorithm, respectively. By comparing the output frequency
of the cryogenic clock to that of a room-temperature clock, the differential
BBR shift between the two was measured with a fractional statistical
uncertainty of 7*10^-18. The differential BBR shift was used to calculate the
static differential polarizability, and it was found in excellent agreement
with our previous measurement with a different method. This work suggests that
the BBR shift of optical clocks can be well suppressed in a liquid nitrogen
environment. This is advantageous because conventional liquid-helium cryogenic
systems for optical clocks are more expensive and complicated. Moreover, the
proposed system can be used to suppress the BBR shift significantly in other

systems with Goldstone bosons (such as the phonons in a crystal) involves
nonholonomic mechanical constraints. By formulating field theories with
symmetries and constraints in a general way using the language of differential
geometry, we show that many examples of constraints in inverse Higgs phenomena
fall into a special class, which we call coholonomic constraints, that are dual
(in the sense of category theory) to holonomic constraints. Just as for
holonomic constraints, systems with coholonomic constraints are equivalent to
unconstrained systems (whose degrees of freedom are known as essential
Goldstone bosons), making it easier to study their consistency and dynamics.
The remaining examples of inverse Higgs phenomena in the literature require the
dual of a slight generalisation of a holonomic constraint, which we call
(co)meronomic. Our formalism simplifies and clarifies the many ad hoc
assumptions and constructions present in the literature. In particular, it
identifies which are necessary and which are merely convenient. It also opens
the way to studying much more general dynamical examples, including systems
which have no well-defined notion of a target space.

example, we propose to assign different weights to them. We construct the
maximal expected loss which is the supremum over any reweighted loss on
augmented samples. Inspired by adversarial training, we minimize this maximal
expected loss (MMEL) and obtain a simple and interpretable closed-form
solution: more attention should be paid to augmented samples with large loss
values (i.e., harder examples). Minimizing this maximal expected loss enables
the model to perform well under any reweighting strategy. The proposed method
can generally be applied on top of any data augmentation methods. Experiments
are conducted on both natural language understanding tasks with token-level
data augmentation, and image classification tasks with commonly-used image
augmentation techniques like random crop and horizontal flip. Empirical results
show that the proposed method improves the generalization performance of the

relationships derived therefrom. Subdividing the total stress into parts from
particle contact and hydrodynamics suggests a critical particle volume fraction
of 0.3 to separate the dense from the dilute regime. In the dilute regime,
i.e., the sediment transport layer, long-range hydrodynamic interactions are
screened by the porous media and the effective viscosity obeys the Einstein
relation.

interconnections, a recent line of research work has formulated the notion of
Distributed Ledger Object (DLO), which is a concurrent object that maintains a

primitive able to append multiple records to distinct ledgers in an atomic way,
is studied as a basic interconnection problem among ledgers.
  In this work, we propose the Distributed Grow-only Set object (DSO), which
instead of maintaining a sequence of records, as in a DLO, maintains a set of
records in an immutable way: only Add and Get operations are provided. This
object is inspired by the Grow-only Set (G-Set) data type which is part of the
Conflict-free Replicated Data Types. We formally specify the object and we
provide a consensus-free Byzantine-tolerant implementation that guarantees
eventual consistency. We then use our Byzantine-tolerant DSO (BDSO)
implementation to provide consensus-free algorithmic solutions to the Atomic
Appends and Atomic Adds (the analogous problem of atomic appends applied on
G-Sets) problems, as well as to construct consensus-free Single-Writer BDLOs.
We believe that the BDSO has applications beyond the above-mentioned problems.

results, up to 40% respondents say that they work with both models and

series data; and the largest categories of problems to be solved are predictive
analysis, time series data, and computer vision. The biggest perceived problems
revolve around data, although there is some awareness of problems related to
deploying models to production and related procedures. To hypothesise, we
believe that organisations represented in the survey can be divided to three
categories -- (i) figuring out how to best use data; (ii) focusing on building
the first models and getting them to production; and (iii) managing several
models, their versions and training datasets, as well as retraining and
frequent deployment of retrained models. In the results, the majority of

the benefits of MLOps only emerge in category (iii) when there is a need for
frequent retraining and redeployment. Hence, setting up an MLOps pipeline is a
natural step to take, when an organization takes the step from ML as a
proof-of-concept to ML as a part of nominal activities.

reduction from 2-set agreement (Casta\~neda et al., 2018).

agreement on cycles of length $c \ge 4$, via a generalisation of Sperner's
Lemma to convex polygons. We also extend the reduction from 2-set agreement to
a larger class of graphs, showing that approximate agreement on on these graphs

existing proofs, are necessary, by showing that the impossibility of a
wait-free algorithm in the nonuniform iterated snapshot model cannot be proved

numerical homogenization can be reduced at controlled errors. Reduction is
systematically applied to specimen size S, resolution R, and discretization D,

(iii) its invariance with respect to the applied boundary conditions and (iv)
the total error as well as spatial error distributions, which are computed and

accuracy-efficiency balances for various classes of heterogeneous materials in

they have emerged as quantum light sources as a result of the controlled
introduction of luminescent quantum defects (sp$^{3}$-defects) with red-shifted
transitions that enable single-photon emission. The complex photophysics of
SWCNTs and overall goal of polariton condensation pose the question of how
exciton-polaritons are populated and how it might be optimized. The
contributions of possible relaxation processes, i.e., scattering with acoustic
phonons, vibrationally assisted scattering, and radiative pumping, are
investigated using angle-resolved reflectivity and time-resolved

We show that the predominant population mechanism for SWCNT exciton-polaritons
in planar microcavities is radiative pumping. Consequently, the limitation of
polariton population due to the low photoluminescence quantum yield of
nanotubes, can be overcome by luminescent sp$^{3}$ defects. Without changing
the polariton branch structure, radiative pumping through these emissive
defects leads to an up to 10-fold increase of the polariton population for
detunings with a large photon fraction. Thus, the controlled and tunable
functionalization of SWCNTs with sp$^{3}$ defects presents a viable route
towards bright and efficient polariton devices.

aggregate friends' information contextualized on the candidate item only, and
this shallow context-aware aggregation makes them suffer from the limited
friends' information. Secondly, for the item attraction, if the item's past

graph neural network to model the social relation and collaborative relation,
and on top of high-order relations, a dual side deep context-aware modulation
is introduced to capture the friends' information and item attraction.
Empirical results on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the
proposed model and further experiments are conducted to help understand how the
dual context-aware modulation works.

tunnel-coupled to external electrodes are frequently studied within the
single-impurity Anderson model with Hubbard on-site interaction. In the present
work, we supplement the model with an important ingredient, namely the
charge-bond interaction, also known as correlated or assisted hopping.
Correlated hopping enters the second-quantised Hamiltonian, written in the
Wannier representation, as an off-diagonal many-body term. Using the equation
of motion technique, we study the effect of the correlated hopping on the
spectral and transport characteristics of a two-terminal quantum dot. Two
different Green functions (GFs) appear: one of them describes the spectral
properties of the quantum dot, the other the transport properties of the
system. The calculation of the transport GF requires the knowledge of the
spectral one. We use decoupling procedures similar to those which properly
describe the standard Anderson model within the Kondo regime and outside of it.
For an arbitrary ratio $x$ between the amplitudes of correlated and
single-particle hopping terms, the transport GF fulfils the $x \leftrightarrow
2-x$ symmetry of the model. The average occupation of the dot also obeys this
symmetry, albeit the spectral function of the quantum dot, calculated within an
analogous decoupling scheme as for the transport GF, does not. We identify the
physical reason for this behavior, and propose a way to cure it. Since the
correlated-hopping term breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the model and
modifies all transport characteristics of the system, the detailed knowledge of
its influence on measurable characteristics is a prerequisite for its
experimental detection. Simple, experimentally feasible methods are proposed.

towards this anomalous CO emission feature. No corresponding elongation is
found on the same spatial scales at 5 GHz with e-MERLIN. We discuss potential

the low-mass case supporting a common mechanism for jet production across all
masses. Associated radio lobes tracing shocks are seen towards $52\%$ of
jet-like objects and are preferentially detected towards jets of higher radio
and bolometric luminosities, resulting from our sensitivity limitations. We

process to infinite precision. Reflecting this, here we investigate how to
extend stochastic thermodynamics to systems with uncertain parameters,
including uncertain number of heat baths / particle reservoirs, uncertainty in
the precise values of temperatures / chemical potentials of those reservoirs,
uncertainty in the energy spectrum, uncertainty in the control protocol, etc.
We formalize such uncertainty with an (arbitrary) probability measure over all
transition rate matrices satisfying local detailed balance. This lets us define
the effective thermodynamic quantities by averaging over all LDB-obeying rate
matrices. We show that the resultant effective entropy violates the second law
of thermodynamics. In contrast to the effective entropy though, the expected
stochastic entropy, defined as the ensemble average of the effective
trajectory-level entropy, satisfies the second law. We then and explicitly
calculate the second-order correction to the second law for the case of one
heat bath with uncertain temperature. We also derive the detailed fluctuation
theorem for expected effective trajectory entropy production for this case, and
derive a lower bound for the associated expected work. Next, to ground these
formal considerations with experimentally testable bounds on allowed
energetics, we derive a bound on the maximal work that can be extracted from
systems with arbitrarily uncertain temperature. We end by extending previous
work on ""thermodynamic value of information"", to allow for uncertainty in the
time-evolution of the rate matrix.

lacking explicit guidance of 3D human pose in visual data. As a result, the
generated mesh often exhibits incorrect pose for complex activities. To tackle
this problem, we propose to exploit 3D pose to calibrate human mesh.
Specifically, we develop two novel Pose Calibration frameworks, i.e., Serial

a serial or parallel manner, these two frameworks can effectively correct human

calibration module is designed via non-rigid pose transformation, our PC-HMR
frameworks can flexibly tackle bone length variations to alleviate misplacement

complementary integration of data-driven learning and geometrical modeling. Via
plug-and-play modules, they can be efficiently adapted for both

of extra 3D pose annotations in the testing phase, which releases inference
difficulties in practice. We perform extensive experiments on the popular

of the art methods are approximate in the sense that they replace the posterior
with a smooth approximation via Moreau-Yosida envelopes, and apply
gradient-based discretized diffusions to sample from the resulting
distribution. We characterize the error of the Moreau-Yosida approximation and
propose a novel implementation using underdamped Langevin dynamics. In
misson-critical cases, however, replacing the posterior with an approximation
may not be a viable option. Instead, we show that Piecewise-Deterministic
Markov Processes (PDMP) can be utilized for exact posterior inference from
distributions satisfying almost everywhere differentiability. Furthermore, in
contrast with diffusion-based methods, the suggested PDMP-based samplers place
no assumptions on the prior shape, nor require access to a computationally
cheap proximal operator, and consequently have a much broader scope of
application. Through detailed numerical examples, including a
non-differentiable circular distribution and a non-convex genomics model, we
elucidate the relative strengths of these sampling methods on problems of
moderate to high dimensions, underlining the benefits of PDMP-based methods
when accurate sampling is decisive.

utilized to reconstruct three-dimensional data from a few numbers of

a square cylinder at the diameter-based Reynolds number $Re_D$ of 300, and show
that volumetric fluid flow data can successfully be reconstructed with the
present method from as few as five sections. Furthermore, we also propose a

For this type of manipulator a complete workspace representation in Study

and output singularities are mapped into a Study subspace as well as into the
joint space. Therewith a detailed singularity investigation of the
translational operation mode of a 3-RUU parallel manipulator is provided. This
paper is an extended version of a previous publication. The addendum comprises
the discovery of a possible transition between two operation modes as well as a
self motion and an examination of another component of the output singularity

have been used successfully for many computer vision tasks, but are difficult
to scale to 3D volumetric medical data. Memory is increasingly often the
bottleneck when training 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Recently,
invertible neural networks have been applied to significantly reduce activation
memory footprint when training neural networks with backpropagation thanks to
the invertible functions that allow retrieving its input from its output
without storing intermediate activations in memory to perform the
backpropagation.
  Among many successful network architectures, 3D Unet has been established as
a standard architecture for volumetric medical segmentation. Thus, we choose 3D
Unet as a baseline for a non-invertible network and we then extend it with the
invertible residual network. In this paper, we proposed two versions of the
invertible Residual Network, namely Partially Invertible Residual Network
(Partially-InvRes) and Fully Invertible Residual Network (Fully-InvRes). In
Partially-InvRes, the invertible residual layer is defined by a technique
called additive coupling whereas in Fully-InvRes, both invertible upsampling
and downsampling operations are learned based on squeezing (known as pixel
shuffle). Furthermore, to avoid the overfitting problem because of less
training data, a variational auto-encoder (VAE) branch is added to reconstruct
the input volumetric data itself. Our results indicate that by using
partially/fully invertible networks as the central workhorse in volumetric
segmentation, we not only reduce memory overhead but also achieve compatible
segmentation performance compared against the non-invertible 3D Unet. We have
demonstrated the proposed networks on various volumetric datasets such as iSeg

$\sigma$ of the finite field $\F_q$. One type is algebraic, in which the
permutation is represented as the composition of degree-one polynomials and $k$
copies of $x^{q-2}$, for some prescribed value of $k$. The other type is
combinatorial, in which the permutation is represented as the composition of a
degree-one rational function followed by the product of $k$ $2$-cycles on
$\bP^1(\F_q):=\F_q\cup\{\infty\}$, where each $2$-cycle moves $\infty$. We show
that, after modding out by obvious equivalences amongst the algebraic
representations, then for each $k$ there is a bijection between the algebraic
representations of $\sigma$ and the combinatorial representations of $\sigma$.
We also prove analogous results for permutations of $\bP^1(\F_q)$. One
consequence is a new characterization of the notion of Carlitz rank of a
permutation on $\F_q$, which we use elsewhere to provide an explicit formula
for the Carlitz rank. Another consequence involves a classical theorem of
Carlitz, which says that if $q>2$ then the group of permutations of $\F_q$ is
generated by the permutations induced by degree-one polynomials and $x^{q-2}$.
Our bijection provides a new perspective from which the two proofs of this

clever tricks that previously appeared to be needed in order to discover those

mass or kinetic $Z$-$Z'$ mixing. By comparing the P2 sensitivity to existing
constraints, we show that in both cases P2 has discovery potential over a wide
range of $Z'$ mass. In particular, for chiral models, the P2 experiment can
probe gauge couplings at the order of $10^{-5}$ when the $Z'$ boson is light,

The similar GFNR means a similar probability of failing to detect risk for
students who drop out. The disparities in GFPR are addressed through a

growing need to decentralize the functionality that realizes self-adaptation.
Our focus is on architecture-based self-adaptive systems where one or more
functions for monitoring, analyzing, planning, and executing are realized by
multiple components that coordinate with one another. While some earlier
studies have shed light on existing work on the decentralization of
self-adaptive systems, there is currently no clear overview of the state of the
art in decentralization of self-adaptive systems. Yet, having a precise view on
the state of the art in decentralized self-adaptive systems is crucial for
researchers to understand existing solutions and drive future research efforts.
To address this gap, we conducted a mapping study. The study focused on papers
published at 24 important venues that publish research on self-adaptation. The
study focused on the motivations for choosing a decentralized approach to
realize self-adaptation, the adaptation functions that are decentralized, the
realization of the coordination, and the open challenges in the area.

more regular than random, that they move more slowly than could be expected
from simple mean-field arguments, and that their energy is significantly lower
than in a random reorganisation of the same vortices. This is traced to
screening of long-range interactions by the preferential association of
vortices of opposite sign, and it is argued that this is due to the mutual
capture of corrotating vortices, in a mechanism closer to tidal disruption than
to electrostatic screening. Finally, the possible relation of these `stochastic

dedicated magnetic survey missions such as CHAMP and Swarm play a key role in
the construction of such models. Unfortunately, there are no magnetic data from
such satellites after the end of CHAMP in 2010 and before the launch of Swarm
in late 2013. This limits our ability to recover signals on timescales of 3
years and less during this gap period. The magnetic data from platform
magnetometers carried by satellites for navigational purposes may help address
this data gap provided that they are carefully calibrated. Earlier studies have
demonstrated that platform magnetometer data can be calibrated using a fixed
reference field model. However, this approach can lead to biased calibration
parameters. An alternative has been developed in the form of a co-estimation
scheme which consists of simultaneously estimating both the calibration
parameters and a model of the internal geomagnetic field. Here, we develop a
scheme, based on the CHAOS framework, that involves the co-estimation of a
geomagnetic field model along with calibration parameters of platform
magnetometers. Using our implementation, we are able to derive a geomagnetic
field model from 2008 to 2018 with satellite magnetic data from CHAMP, Swarm,
secular variation data from ground observatories, and platform magnetometer
data from CryoSat-2 and GRACE. Through experiments, we explore correlations
between the estimates of the geomagnetic field and the calibration parameters,

Assembly, it features a rapid decrease in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission in
the 171 \r{A} channel images, and a simultaneous increase in the 211 \r{A}
images. Here, we analyze the coronal thermodynamic and magnetic properties to
probe its physical origin. We calculate the time-dependent differential
emission measures for a sample of 18 events between 2010 and 2012. The emission
measure (EM) decrease in the temperature range $5.7 \le \log_{10}T \le 5.9$ is
well correlated with the EM increase in $6.2 \le \log_{10}T \le 6.4$ over eight
orders of magnitude. This suggests that the coronal plasma is being heated from
the quiet-Sun, sub-MK temperature to 1-2 MK, more typical for ARs. Potential
field extrapolation indicates significant change in the local magnetic
connectivity: the dimming region is now linked to the newly emerged flux via
longer loops. We conclude that emerging dimming is likely caused by coronal
heating episodes, powered by reconnection between the emerging and the ambient

learned features supervised by softmax loss are separable but not
discriminative enough, since softmax loss does not explicitly encourage
intra-class compactness and interclass separability; and b) fixed filter banks
and hand-crafted features are insufficient to capture forgery patterns of
frequency from diverse inputs. To compensate for such limitations, a novel

compresses intra-class variations of natural faces while boosting inter-class
differences in the embedding space. In such a case, the network can learn more
discriminative features with less optimization difficulty. Besides, an adaptive
frequency feature generation module is developed to mine frequency clues in a

to the domain shift, e.g., caused by the variations in imaging protocols. In
this paper, we propose a novel vessel-mixing based consistency regularization
framework, for cross-domain learning in retinal A/V classification. Specially,
to alleviate the severe bias to source domain, based on the label smooth prior,
the model is regularized to give consistent predictions for unlabeled
target-domain inputs that are under perturbation. This consistency
regularization implicitly introduces a mechanism where the model and the
perturbation is opponent to each other, where the model is pushed to be robust
enough to cope with the perturbation. Thus, we investigate a more difficult
opponent to further inspire the robustness of model, in the scenario of retinal
A/V, called vessel-mixing perturbation. Specially, it effectively disturbs the
fundus images especially the vessel structures by mixing two images regionally.
We conduct extensive experiments on cross-domain A/V classification using four
public datasets, which are collected by diverse institutions and imaging
devices. The results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art

fully supervised learning on target domain.

directly in the laboratory since its prediction in 1934 despite its fundamental
importance in quantum electrodynamics and astrophysics. In the last few years,
several experimental setup have been proposed to observe this process in the
laboratory, relying either on thermal radiation, Bremsstrahlung, linear or
multiphoton inverse Compton scattering photons sources created by lasers or by
the mean of a lepton collider coupled with lasers. In these propositions, the
influence of the photons' energy distribution on the total number of produced
pairs has been taken into account with an analytical model only for two of
these cases. We hereafter develop a general and original, semi-analytical model
to estimate the influence of the photons energy distribution on the total
number of pairs produced by the collision of two such photon beams, and give
optimum energy parameters for some of the proposed experimental configurations.
Our results shows that the production of optimum Bremsstrahlung and linear
inverse Compton sources are, only from energy distribution considerations,
already reachable in today's facilities. Despite its less interesting energy
distribution features for the LBW pair production, the photon sources generated
via multiphoton inverse Compton scattering by the propagation of a laser in a
micro-channel can also be interesting, thank to the high collision luminosity
that could eventually be reached by such configurations. These results then
gives important insights for the design of experiments intended to detect
linear Breit-Wheeler produced positrons in the laboratory for the first time.

hanging nodes problem encountered in standard finite element analysis (FEA),
the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is deployed as a spatial
discretization scheme. Consequently, arbitrarily shaped star-convex polyhedral
elements are straightforwardly generated. Considering the scaling and
transformation of octree cells, the stiffness and mass matrices of a limited
number of unique cell patterns are pre-computed. A recently proposed mass
lumping technique is extended to 3D yielding a well-conditioned diagonal mass
matrix. This enables us to leverage the advantages of explicit time integrator,
i.e., it is possible to efficiently compute the nodal displacements without the
need for solving a system of linear equations. We implement the proposed scheme
together with a central difference method (CDM) in a distributed computing

means of several numerical benchmark examples, including complex geometries and
various practical applications. A significant speedup is observed for these

trained on simulated samples has come at the cost of reduced interpretability,
raising concerns about their reliability. We elucidate the physics behind
quark/gluon jet classification decisions by comparing the performance of
networks with and without constraints of infrared and collinear safety, and
identify the nature of the unsafe information by revealing the energy and
angular dependence of the learned models. This in turn allows us to approximate
the performance of the low-level networks (by 99\% or higher) using equivalent
sets of interpretable high-level observables, which can be used to probe the
fidelity of the simulated samples and define systematic uncertainties.

separated boundary layer flows (involving small and large separation) under the
influence of an adverse pressure gradient. A unified picture of the
pre-transitional boundary layer for the three cases has been provided that
reveals a ""mixed-mode"" instability, involving contribution from instability
waves and streamwise streaks. A time-frequency analysis of the transitional
velocity signals has been performed which shows that as the Reynolds number
decreases, the character of the time traces evolves continuously from a
""spotty"" behaviour (exhibiting distinct turbulent spots) for the attached case
to a ""non-spotty"" behaviour (involving more ""uniform"" distribution of turbulent
fluctuations in time) for the large separation case, encompassing the entire
spectrum of transition scenarios. The variation of the intermittency factor
within the transition zone is seen to compare well with the Narasimha universal
intermittency distribution. We find that although the time variation of
velocity for large separation is non-spotty (or more ""uniform""), the spanwise
variation of velocity is spotty, showing a clear clustering of high-wavenumber
fluctuations separated by quasi-laminar regions. Thus, all the cases exhibit
spottiness in the transition zone with different manifestations. We present a
physical cartoon for the transition scenarios for the attached and separated
cases, using the ideas of vortex-wall interaction and instability of spanwise
vortical structures. We find that concentrated breakdown is exhibited by all
the three cases near the transition onset and the spot breakdown processes are
broadly consistent with the postulates underlying the universal intermittency
distribution.

mobile robots moving in a shared workspace, each of which is assigned a linear
temporal logic specification. Based on the realistic assumptions that each
robot is subject to both state and input constraints and can have only local
view and local information, a fully distributed multi-robot motion coordination
strategy is proposed. For each robot, the motion coordination strategy consists
of three layers. An offline layer pre-computes the braking area for each region
in the workspace, the controlled transition system, and a so-called potential
function. An initialization layer outputs an initially safely satisfying
trajectory. An online coordination layer resolves conflicts when one occurs.
The online coordination layer is further decomposed into three steps. Firstly,
a conflict detection algorithm is implemented, which detects conflicts with
neighboring robots. Whenever conflicts are detected, a rule is designed to
assign dynamically a planning order to each pair of neighboring robots.
Finally, a sampling-based algorithm is designed to generate local
collision-free trajectories for the robot which at the same time guarantees the
feasibility of the specification. Safety is proven to be guaranteed for all
robots at any time. The effectiveness and the computational tractability of the
resulting solution is verified numerically by two case studies.

transactions, quite many approaches have been proposed to detect defects and
security problems before smart contracts become persistent in the blockchain
and they are granted control on substantial financial value.
  Because smart contracts source code might not be available, static analysis
approaches mostly face the challenge of analysing compiled Ethereum bytecode,
that is available directly from the official blockchain. However, due to the
intrinsic complexity of Ethereum bytecode (especially in jump resolution),
static analysis encounters significant obstacles that reduce the accuracy of
exiting automated tools.
  This paper presents a novel static analysis algorithm based on the symbolic
execution of the Ethereum operand stack that allows us to resolve jumps in
Ethereum bytecode and to construct an accurate control-flow graph (CFG) of the
compiled smart contracts. EtherSolve is a prototype implementation of our
approach. Experimental results on a significant set of real world Ethereum
smart contracts show that EtherSolve improves the accuracy of the execrated
CFGs with respect to the state of the art available approaches.
  Many static analysis techniques are based on the CFG representation of the
code and would therefore benefit from the accurate extraction of the CFG. For
example, we implemented a simple extension of EtherSolve that allows to detect
instances of the re-entrancy vulnerability.

as some of the best candidates to study HMSF within the Milky Way. To do so, we
have obtained a set of large mosaics covering these IRDCs with ALMA at band 3
(or 3mm). These observations have a high angular resolution (~3arcsec or
~0.05pc), and high continuum and spectral line sensitivity (~0.15mJy/beam and
~0.2K per 0.1km/s channel at the N2H+(1-0) transition). From the dust continuum
emission, we identify 96 cores ranging from low- to high-mass (M = 3.4 to
50.9Msun) that are gravitationally bound (alpha_vir = 0.3 to 1.3) and which
would require magnetic field strengths of B = 0.3 to 1.0mG to be in virial
equilibrium. We combine these results with a homogenised catalogue of
literature cores to recover the hierarchical structure within these clouds over
four orders of magnitude in spatial scale (0.01pc to 10pc). Using supplementary
observations at an even higher angular resolution, we find that the smallest
fragments (<0.02pc) within this hierarchy do not currently have the mass and/or
the density required to form high-mass stars. Nonetheless, the new ALMA
observations presented in this paper have facilitated the identification of 19
(6 quiescent and 13 star-forming) cores that retain >16Msun without further
fragmentation. These high-mass cores contain trans-sonic non-thermal motions,
are kinematically sub-virial, and require moderate magnetic field strengths for
support against collapse. The identification of these potential sites of
high-mass star formation represents a key step in allowing us to test the
predictions from high-mass star and cluster formation theories.

strict limitations on the algorithms that can be implemented efficiently. In
quantum chemistry, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has
become ubiquitous, using the functional form of the ansatz as a degree of
freedom, whose parameters are found variationally in a feedback loop between
the quantum processor and its conventional counterpart. Alternatively, a
promising new avenue has been unraveled by the quantum variants of techniques
grounded on expansions of the moments of the Hamiltonian, among which two stand
out: the connected moments expansion (CMX) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 58, 53 (1987)] and
the Peeters-Devreese-Soldatov (PDS) functional [J. Phys. A 17, 625 (1984); Int.
J. Mod. Phys. B 9, 2899], the latter based on the standard moments <$H^k$>.
Contrasting with VQE-based methods and provided the quantum circuit prepares a
state with non-vanishing overlap with the true ground state, CMX often
converges to the ground state energy, while PDS is guaranteed to converge by
virtue of being variational. However, for a finite CMX/PDS order, the circuit
may significantly impact the energy accuracy. Here we use the ADAPT-VQE
algorithm to test shallow circuit construction strategies that are not expected
to impede their implementation in the present quantum hardware while granting
sizable accuracy improvement in the computed ground state energies. We also
show that we can take advantage of the fact that the terms in the connected
moments are highly recurring in different powers, incurring a sizable reduction
in the number of necessary measurements. By coupling this measurement caching
with a threshold that determines whether a given term is to be measured based
on its associated scalar coefficient, we observe a further reduction in the
number of circuit implementations while allowing for tunable accuracy.

in the past few years, the performance and efficiency of detecting small
objects are far from satisfactory. The most common and effective way to promote
small object detection is to use high-resolution images or feature maps.
However, both approaches induce costly computation since the computational cost
grows squarely as the size of images and features increases. To get the best of
two worlds, we propose QueryDet that uses a novel query mechanism to accelerate
the inference speed of feature-pyramid based object detectors. The pipeline
composes two steps: it first predicts the coarse locations of small objects on
low-resolution features and then computes the accurate detection results using
high-resolution features sparsely guided by those coarse positions. In this
way, we can not only harvest the benefit of high-resolution feature maps but
also avoid useless computation for the background area. On the popular COCO
dataset, the proposed method improves the detection mAP by 1.0 and mAP-small by
2.0, and the high-resolution inference speed is improved to 3.0x on average. On
VisDrone dataset, which contains more small objects, we create a new
state-of-the-art while gaining a 2.3x high-resolution acceleration on average.

In both cases we find a remarkably similar phenomenology as the measurement
strength $\gamma$ is increased, namely a sharp transition from a critical phase
with logarithmic scaling of the entanglement to an area-law phase, which occurs
at the same value of the measurement rate in the two protocols. An effective
central charge, extracted from the logarithmic scaling of the entanglement,
vanishes continuously at the common transition point, although with different
critical behavior possibly suggesting different universality classes for the
two protocols. We interpret the central charge mismatch near the transition in
terms of noise-induced disentanglement, as suggested by the entanglement
statistics which displays emergent bimodality upon approaching the critical
point. The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and its associated subradiance spectral

for high accuracy tracking. Likewise, using multiple cameras requires
estimating their extrinsic parameters, also a tedious process that must be
repeated whenever a camera is moved.

binary periods $\sim 5$ min, the CO$_{\rm core}$ collapse originates the
subclass BdHN I characterized by: 1) an energetic supernova (the ""SN-rise""); 2)
a black hole (BH), born from the NS collapse by SN matter accretion, leading to
a GeV emission with luminosity $L_{\rm GeV} = A_{\rm GeV}\,t^{-\alpha_{\rm
GeV}}$, observed only in some cases; 3) a new NS ($\nu$NS), born from the SN,
originating the X-ray afterglow with $L_X = A_{\rm X}\,t^{-\alpha_{\rm X}}$,
observed in all BdHN I. We record $378$ sources and present for four prototypes
GRBs 130427A, 160509A, 180720B and 190114C: 1) spectra, luminosities, SN-rise
duration; 2) $A_X$, $\alpha_X=1.48\pm 0.32$, and 3) the $\nu$NS spin
time-evolution. We infer a) $A_{\rm GeV}$, $\alpha_{\rm GeV}=1.19 \pm 0.04$; b)
the BdHN I morphology from time-resolved spectral analysis, three-dimensional
simulations, and the GeV emission presence/absence in $54$ sources within the
Fermi-LAT boresight angle. For $25$ sources, we give the integrated and
time-varying GeV emission, $29$ sources have no GeV emission detected and show
X/gamma-ray flares previously inferred as observed along the binary plane. The
$25/54$ ratio implies the GeV radiation is emitted within a cone of
half-opening angle $\approx 60^{\circ}$ from the normal to the orbital plane.
We deduce BH masses $2.3$-$8.9~M_\odot$ and spin $0.27$-$0.87$ by explaining
the GeV emission from the BH energy extraction, while their time evolution
validates the BH mass-energy formula.

changing wall friction on the gravity-driven flow of spherical particles in a
vertical hopper. In 2D experiments and simulations, we observe that the
exponent of the expected power-law scaling of mass flow rate with opening size
(known as Beverloo's law) decreases as the coefficient of friction between
particles and wall increases, whereas Beverloo scaling works as expected in 3D.
In our 2D experiments, we find that wall friction plays the biggest role in a
region near the outlet comparable in height to the largest opening size.
However, wall friction is not the only factor determining a constant rate of
flow, as we observe a near-constant mass outflow rate in the 2D simulations
even when wall friction is set to zero. We show in our simulations that an
increase in wall friction leaves packing fractions relatively unchanged, while
average particle velocities become independent of opening size as the
coefficient of friction increases. We track the spatial pattern of
time-averaged particle velocities and accelerations inside the hopper. We
observe that the hemisphere-like region above the opening where particles begin
to accelerate is largely independent of opening size at finite wall friction.
However, the magnitude of particle accelerations decreases significantly as
wall friction increases, which in turn results in mean sphere velocities that
no longer scale with opening size, consistent with our observations of mass
flow rate scaling. The case of zero wall friction is anomalous, in that most of
the acceleration takes place near the outlet.

The speed-up arises from the fact that after training, the DNN predicts the
stress without any iterations, as opposed to the iterative nature of standard
non-linear solvers. The new DNN surrogate model also proves suited for general
purposes: it is capable to reproduce the stress distribution in geometries
topologically far different from those used for training, implying effective
learning of scenarios described by the underlying partial differential
equations. Even in the case of elasto-plastic materials with up to 2 times
mechanical contrast in elastic stiffness and 4 times in yield stress among

simulates the micromechanics with a MAPE of 6.4% in one single forward

physicists what kind of data from biology is necessary for such a modeling
endeavor. Here, we aim to model these clusters of coarse-grained protein
assemblies from multiple subunits through the constraints of interactions among
the subunits and the chemical potential of each subunit. We obtained the
constraints on the interactions among subunits from the known protein
structures. We inferred the chemical potential, that dictates the particle
number distribution of each protein subunit, from the knowledge of protein
abundance from experimental data. Guided by the maximum entropy principle, we
formulate an inverse statistical mechanical method to infer the distribution of
particle numbers from the data of protein abundance as chemical potentials for
a grand canonical multi-component mixture. Using grand canonical Monte Carlo
simulations, we captured a distribution of high-order clusters in a protein
complex of Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) with four known subunits. The
complexity of hierarchical clusters varies with the relative protein abundance
of each subunit in distinctive cell types such as lung, heart, and brain. When
the crowding content increases, we observed that crowding stabilizes emergent
clusters that do not exist in dilute conditions. We, therefore, proposed a

progenitor composed of a carbon-oxygen core (CO$_{\rm core}$) and a neutron
star (NS) companion with orbital period $\sim 5$ min. The gravitational
collapse of the CO$_{\rm core}$ generates a supernova (SN) and a new NS
($\nu$NS) at its center. The SN hypercritical accretion onto the companion NS
triggers its gravitational collapse forming a black hole (BH). An
electrodynamical process near the BH horizon leads to the long-lasting GeV
emission with power-law luminosity $L_{\rm GeV}\propto t^{-1.19\pm0.04}$,
powered by the BH rotational energy. Correspondingly, we determine the BH mass
and spin. The $\nu$NS via its pulsar-like emission and fallback accretion
injects energy into the magnetized SN ejecta generating synchrotron radiation.
This explains the \textit{long-lasting} X-ray afterglow with power-law

overcoming the problem of sparse or uninformative rewards. However, RS
typically relies on manually engineered shaping-reward functions whose
construction is time-consuming and error-prone. It also requires domain
knowledge which runs contrary to the goal of autonomous learning. We introduce
Reinforcement Learning Optimising Shaping Algorithm (ROSA), an automated reward
shaping framework in which the shaping-reward function is constructed in a
Markov game between two agents. A reward-shaping agent (Shaper) uses switching
controls to determine which states to add shaping rewards for more efficient
learning while the other agent (Controller) learns the optimal policy for the
task using these shaped rewards. We prove that ROSA, which adopts existing RL
algorithms, learns to construct a shaping-reward function that is beneficial to
the task thus ensuring efficient convergence to high performance policies. We
demonstrate ROSA's properties in three didactic experiments and show its
superior performance against state-of-the-art RS algorithms in challenging
sparse reward environments.

class-agnostic point cloud segmentation, specifically for the task of instance
label prediction. The proposed method is able to segment any class of objects
using a single deep neural network without any assumptions about their shapes
and sizes. The deep neural network is trained to predict how to add or remove
points from a point cloud region to morph it into incrementally more complete

biological molecular motors that accounts for local association/dissociation
events. In our approach, the particles interacting only via exclusion move
along a lattice in the preferred direction, while the reversible associations
are allowed at the specific site far away from the boundaries. Considering the
association/dissociation site as a local defect, the inhomogeneous system is
approximated as two coupled homogeneous sub-lattices. This allows us to obtain
a full description of stationary dynamics in the system. It is found that the
number and nature of steady-state phases strongly depend on the values of
association and dissociation transition rates. Microscopic arguments to explain
these observations, as well as biological implications, are also discussed.

while the nanoparticles are shown not to be toxic for these cells, upon
Near-Infrared irradiation their almost complete killing is achieved. The
combination of all four therapeutic modalities is then evaluated in an ex ovo

in $R > 3M$ both minima and maxima can exist. The intersection of (1) with the

Typically, $\theta$ has no zeros or two zeros along a ray, and becomes $+
\infty$ at the Big Crunch (BC). The only rays on which $\theta \to - \infty$ at
the BC are the radial ones. Along rays on the boundaries between the no-zeros

carefully analyze the data with the SIR inversion code using a given initial
atmospheric model. The code provides a set of atmospheric models that reproduce
the observations. These models are then used to train a CNN. Afterwards, the
same data are again inverted with SIR but using the trained CNN to provide the
initial guess atmospheric models for SIR. The CNNs allow us to significantly
reduce the number of inversion cycles when used to compute initial guess model
atmospheres, decreasing the computational time for LTE inversions by a factor
of two to four. CNN's alone are much faster than assisted inversions, but the
latter are more robust and accurate. The advantages and limitations of machine
learning techniques for estimating optimum initial atmospheric models for
spectral line inversions are discussed. Finally, we describe a python wrapper
for the SIR and DeSIRe codes that allows for the easy setup of parallel
inversions. The assisted inversions can speed up the inversion process, but the
efficiency and accuracy of the inversion results depend strongly on the solar
scene and the data used for the CNN training. This method (assisted inversions)
will not obviate the need for analyzing individual events with the utmost care
but will provide solar scientists with a much better opportunity to sample
large amounts of inverted data, which will undoubtedly broaden the physical

with the aid of remote sensing imagery. Significant previous work is based on
fully supervised learning with classical classifiers or convolutional neural

ground-truth to provide accurate supervision. Weakly supervised methods can
accept image-wise annotations which can help reduce the cost for pixel-level
labelling. Inevitable performance gap, however, exists between weakly and fully
supervised methods in mapping accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a
pseudo supervised deep convolutional network with label correction strategy
(PS-CNNLC) for solar panels mapping. It combines the benefits of both weak and
strong supervision to provide accurate solar panel extraction. First, a
convolutional neural network is trained with positive and negative samples with
image-level labels. It is then used to automatically identify more positive
samples from randomly selected unlabeled images. The feature maps of the
positive samples are further processed by gradient-weighted class activation
mapping to generate initial mapping results, which are taken as initial pseudo
labels as they are generally coarse and incomplete. A progressive label
correction strategy is designed to refine the initial pseudo labels and train
an end-to-end target mapping network iteratively, thereby improving the model
reliability. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation study conducted validate
the superiority of the proposed PS-CNNLC.

implement polyhedral elements based on the SBFEM into the commercial finite

user subroutine UEL. Detailed explanations regarding the data structures and
implementational aspects of the procedures are given. The focus of the current

are created on polyhedral user elements to establish interactions. This is
achieved by an overlay of standard finite elements with negligible stiffness,
provided in the ABAQUS element library, with polyhedral user elements. By means
of several numerical examples, the advantages of polyhedral elements regarding
the treatment of non-matching interfaces and automatic mesh generation are
clearly demonstrated. Thus, the performance of ABAQUS for problems involving

the implementation of polyhedral user elements, ABAQUS can directly handle

  Explicit and efficient placement of page tables is crucial for large memory
footprint applications with high TLB miss rates because they incur dramatically
higher page walk latency when page table pages are placed in NVMM. We show that
(i) page table pages can end up on NVMM even when enough DRAM memory is

pressure are not migrated back later when memory is available in DRAM.

stratospheric O3 and temperatures over the past 40 years. The CRE predictions
of 11-year cyclic variations of the Antarctic O3 hole and associated
stratospheric cooling have also been well confirmed. Measured altitude profiles
of ozone and temperatures in Antarctic ozone holes provide convincing
fingerprints of the CRE mechanism. A quantitative estimate indicates that the
CRE-produced Cl atoms could completely deplete or even over-kill ozone in the
CR-peak polar stratospheric region, consistent with observed altitude profiles
of severest Antarctic ozone holes. After removing the natural CR effect, the
hidden recovery in the Antarctic O3 hole since around 1995 is clearly
discovered, while the recovery of O3 loss at mid-latitudes is being delayed by

If the CR intensity keeps the current rising trend, the Antarctic O3 hole will
return to the 1980 level by around 2060, while the returning of the O3 layer at
mid-latitudes to the 1980 level will largely be delayed or will not even occur

hole of the same mass. Previous calculations in Ref.[1] demonstrated that the
probability of the tunneling is $p \propto \exp(-2S_\text{BH})$, where
$S_\text{BH}$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This in
particular suggests that the entropy of the white hole is with minus sign the
entropy of the black hole, $S_\text{WH}(M)=- S_\text{BH}(M)= - A/(4G)$. Here we
use a different way of calculations. We consider three different types of the
hole objects: black hole, white hole and the fully static intermediate state.
The probability of tunneling transitions between these three states is found
using singularities in the coordinate transformations between these objects.
The black and white holes are described by the Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates
with opposite shift vectors, while the intermediate state is described by the
static Schwarzschild coordinates. The singularities in the coordinate
transformations lead to the imaginary part in the action, which determines the
tunneling exponent. For the white hole the negative entropy is obtained, while
the intermediate state -- the fully static hole -- has zero entropy. This
procedure is extended to the Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole and to its white
and static partners, and also to the entropy and temperature of the de Sitter

the intensity of sound waves is proportional to the square of their amplitude,
a result that is theoretically analysed in any introductory wave course but
rarely demonstrated empirically. To achieve our goal, we use an audio signal
generator that, when connected to a loudspeaker, produces sine waves that can
be easily observed and measured using an oscilloscope. The measurements made
with these instruments allow us to create a plot of amplitude versus sound
intensity level, which verifies the mathematical relationship between amplitude
and intensity mentioned above. Among the experimental errors, the plot obtained
is in excellent agreement with what is theoretically expected.

content online has made it impossible to fact-check every single suspicious
claim or article, either manually or automatically. Thus, many researchers are
shifting their attention to higher granularity, aiming to profile entire news
outlets, which makes it possible to detect likely ""fake news"" the moment it is
published, by simply checking the reliability of its source. Source factuality
is also an important element of systems for automatic fact-checking and ""fake
news"" detection, as they need to assess the reliability of the evidence they
retrieve online. Political bias detection, which in the Western political
landscape is about predicting left-center-right bias, is an equally important
topic, which has experienced a similar shift towards profiling entire news
outlets. Moreover, there is a clear connection between the two, as highly
biased media are less likely to be factual; yet, the two problems have been
addressed separately. In this survey, we review the state of the art on media
profiling for factuality and bias, arguing for the need to model them jointly.
We further discuss interesting recent advances in using different information
sources and modalities, which go beyond the text of the articles the target
news outlet has published. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline
future research directions.

(FeMGs), which have shown great commercial value. Theories or models
established based on condensed matter physics exhibit several exceptions and
limited accuracy. In this work, machine learning (ML) models learned from a
large amount of experimental data were trained based on eXtreme gradient
boosting (XGBoost), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forest to
predict the magnetic properties of FeMGs. The XGBoost and ANN models exhibited
comparably excellent predictive performance, with R^2 >= 0.903, mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) <= 6.17, and root mean squared error (RMSE) <= 0.098.
The trained ML models aggregate the influence of 13 factors, which is difficult
to achieve in traditional physical models. The influence of local structure,
which was represented by the experimental parameter of the supercooled liquid
region, presented a significant impact on the predictive performance of ML
models. The developed ML-based method here can predict the magnetic properties
of FeMGs by considering multiple factors simultaneously, including complex
local structures.

of an optimized transportation, fast but with low costs, saving resources but
also safe, with low or zero emissions. Thus, it is important to have an
overview of existing research in this field, to know what was already done and
what is to be studied next. The main objective is to explore a beneficent
selection of the existing research, methods and information in the field of
multimodal transportation research, to identify industry needs and gaps in
research and provide context for future research. The selective survey covers
multimodal transport design and optimization in terms of: cost, time, and
network topology. The multimodal transport theoretical aspects, context and
resources are also covering various aspects. The survey's selection includes
nowadays best methods and solvers for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).
The gap between theory and real-world applications should be further solved in
order to optimize the global multimodal transportation system.

  bioactivity testing",,,,,"physics.med-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) has been used as the buffer in
bioactivity testing for over two decades and has become a standard choice for
the scientific community. While it is believed to be non-interacting, the
extent of its interactions with titanium oxide surfaces has not been
systematically studied. Here, we use experimental (zeta potential measurements)
and computational (molecular dynamics) approaches to evaluate the interaction
of Tris with a rutile surface and how it affects the adsorption of other
molecules relevant in biomedical in vitro testing. We show that the interaction
of Tris with the rutile surface is strong and significantly affects the
interaction of other organic residues with the surface. These strong
interactions are compounded by the Tris concentration in the in vitro testing
protocol which is much higher compared to other components. Our findings
indicate that the kinetics observed in in vitro tests will be strongly
influenced by the presence of Tris as a buffering agent when compared to the
natural CO2 buffer in blood. These results reveal that considering the so-far
neglected active role of Tris in in vitro testing is critically needed and that
in vitro protocols using CO2 partial pressure as the buffering agent should
yield more reliable results.

many tasks, including for diagnostics AI, the focus is now on challenges
possibly affecting DL deployment, including AI privacy, domain generalization,
and fairness. This last challenge is addressed in this study. Here we look at a
novel method for ensuring AI fairness with respect to protected or sensitive
factors. This method uses domain adaptation via training set enhancement to
tackle bias-causing training data imbalance. More specifically, it uses
generative models that allow the generation of more synthetic training samples
for underrepresented populations. This paper applies this method to the use
case of detection of age related macular degeneration (AMD). Our experiments
show that starting with an originally biased AMD diagnostics model the method
has the ability to improve fairness.

satisfy the Rawlsian principle of fair equality of opportunity (FEO).
RAWLSNET's BN models generate aspirational data distributions: data generated
to reflect an ideally fair, FEO-satisfying society. FEO states that everyone
with the same talent and willingness to use it should have the same chance of
achieving advantageous social positions (e.g., employment), regardless of their
background circumstances (e.g., socioeconomic status). Satisfying FEO requires
alterations to social structures such as school assignments. Our paper
describes RAWLSNET, a method which takes as input a BN representation of an FEO
application and alters the BN's parameters so as to satisfy FEO when possible,
and minimize deviation from FEO otherwise. We also offer guidance for applying
RAWLSNET, including on recognizing proper applications of FEO. We demonstrate
the use of our system with publicly available data sets. RAWLSNET's altered BNs
offer the novel capability of generating aspirational data for FEO-relevant
tasks. Aspirational data are free from the biases of real-world data, and thus
are useful for recognizing and detecting sources of unfairness in machine
learning algorithms besides biased data.

servers which include all necessary hardware resources (mainly CPU, RAM,
network and disks) to run applications. Such an architecture comes with two
main limitations: (1) difficulty to achieve full resource utilization and (2)
coarse granularity for hardware maintenance. Recently, many works investigated
a resource-centric approach called disaggregated architecture where the
datacenter is composed of self-content resource boards interconnected using
fast interconnection technologies, each resource board including instances of
one resource type. The resource-centric architecture allows each resource to be
managed (maintenance, allocation) independently. LegoOS is the first work which
studied the implications of disaggregation on the operating system, proposing
to disaggregate the operating system itself. They demonstrated the suitability
of this approach, considering mainly CPU and RAM resources. However, they
didn't study the implication of disaggregation on network resources. We
reproduced a LegoOS infrastructure and extended it to support disaggregated
networking. We show that networking can be disaggregated following the same
principles, and that classical networking optimizations such as DMA, DDIO or
loopback can be reproduced in such an environment. Our evaluations show the
viability of the approach and the potential of future disaggregated
infrastructures.
