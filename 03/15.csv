central challenge in quantum science and technology. Over the last decades, a
rich variety of methods to extend coherence have been developed. A
complementary approach is to look for naturally occurring systems that are
inherently protected against decoherence. Here, we show that pairs of identical
nuclear spins in solids form intrinsically long-lived quantum systems. We study
three carbon-13 pairs in diamond and realize high-fidelity measurements of
their quantum states using a single NV center in their vicinity. We then reveal
that the spin pairs are robust to external perturbations due to a unique
combination of three phenomena: a clock transition, a decoherence-free
subspace, and a variant on motional narrowing. The resulting inhomogeneous
dephasing time is $T_2^* = 1.9(3)$ minutes, the longest reported for
individually controlled qubits. Finally, we develop complete control and
realize an entangled state between two spin-pair qubits through projective
parity measurements. These long-lived qubits are abundantly present in diamond
and other solids, and provide new opportunities for quantum sensing, quantum
information processing, and quantum networks.

on anisotropic-slip substrates are investigated, using both molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations and a Langevin model. The anisotropy of slip on substrates is
achieved using a specific lattice plane of a face-centred cubic lattice. This
surface's anisotropy breaks the simple scalar proportionality between slip
velocity and wall shear stress and requires the introduction of a
slip-coefficient tensor. The Langevin equation can describe both the growth of
capillary wave spectra and the relaxation of capillary wave correlations, with
the former providing a time scale for the surface to reach thermal equilibrium.
Temporal correlations of interfacial Fourier modes, measured at thermal
equilibrium in MD, demonstrate that (i) larger slip lengths lead to a faster
decay in wave correlations, and (ii) unlike on isotropic-slip substrates, the
time correlations of waves on anisotropic-slip substrates are wave-direction
dependent. These findings emerge naturally from the proposed Langevin equation,
which becomes wave-direction dependent, agrees well with MD results, and allows
to produce experimentally-verifiable predictions.

the proposed regions to contain most parts of the objects thus fails to locate

of their success in learning representations from graph-structured data across
several critical applications in cloud and HPC. Owing to their unique compute
and memory characteristics that come from an interplay between dense and sparse

work is to characterize and understand the design-space of dataflow choices for
running GNNs on spatial accelerators in order for mappers or design-space
exploration tools to optimize the dataflow based on the workload. Specifically,
we propose a taxonomy to describe all possible choices for mapping the dense
and sparse phases of GNN inference, spatially and temporally over a spatial
accelerator, capturing both the intra-phase dataflow and the inter-phase

benefits of several dataflows and perform case studies on implications of
hardware parameters for dataflows and value of flexibility to support pipelined
execution.

After the massive star explodes, the stellar ejecta interact with this

emission from both the shock-heated CSM and ejecta. The amount of material lost
by the progenitor, the mass of ejecta, and its energetics all impact the bulk

framework is devised to predict the phonon energy distribution by minimizing
the residuals of governing equations and boundary conditions, without the need
for any labeled training data. Moreover, geometric parameters, such as the
characteristic length scale, are included as a part of the input to PINN, which
enables learning BTE solutions in a parametric setting. The effectiveness of
the present scheme is demonstrated by solving a number of phonon transport

Our stochastic framework is based on the notion of stochastic higher-order

For convex problems with uniformly convex objective function we derive local

screening and monitoring the disease. Numerous studies have proposed Deep
Learning approaches for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Although these
methods achieved astonishing performance in detection, they have used limited
chest X-ray (CXR) repositories for evaluation, usually with a few hundred
COVID-19 CXR images only. Thus, such data scarcity prevents reliable evaluation
with the potential of overfitting. In addition, most studies showed no or

constructed the largest benchmark dataset with 33,920 CXR images, including
11,956 COVID-19 samples, where the annotation of ground-truth lung segmentation

quantum physics, a task that is generally intractable with classical computers.
The hardness lies at the ubiquitous anti-commutative relations of quantum
operators, in corresponding with the notorious negative sign problem in
classical simulation. Intuitively, Hamiltonians with more commutative terms are
also easier to simulate on a quantum computer, and anti-commutative relations
generally cause more errors, such as in the product formula method. Here, we
theoretically explore the role of anti-commutative relation in Hamiltonian
simulation. We find that, contrary to our intuition, anti-commutative relations
could also reduce the hardness of Hamiltonian simulation. Specifically,
Hamiltonians with mutually anti-commutative terms are easy to simulate, as what
happens with ones consisting of mutually commutative terms. Such a property is
further utilized to reduce the algorithmic error or the gate complexity in the
truncated Taylor series quantum algorithm for general problems. Moreover, we
propose two modified linear combinations of unitaries methods tailored for
Hamiltonians with different degrees of anti-commutation. We numerically verify
that the proposed methods exploiting anti-commutative relations could
significantly improve the simulation accuracy of electronic Hamiltonians. Our
work sheds light on the roles of commutative and anti-commutative relations in

quantum state. It is dimensionless; it is a relativistic scalar, it is
invariant under coordinate transformation of position and momentum that
maintain conjugate properties and under CPT transformations; and its minimum is
positive due to the uncertainty principle.
  To excogitate why some quantum physical processes cannot take place even
though they obey conservation laws, we partition the set of all evolutions of
an initial state into four blocks, based on whether the entropy is (i)
increasing but not a constant, (ii) decreasing but not a constant, (iii) a
constant, (iv) oscillating. We propose a law that in quantum physics entropy
(weakly) increases over time. Thus, evolutions in the set (ii) are disallowed,
and evolutions in set (iv) are barred from completing an oscillation period by
instantaneously transitioning to a new state. This law for quantum physics
limits physical scenarios beyond conservation laws, providing causality
reasoning by defining a time arrow.

software-intensive products. The need to understand product development in
startups and to provide relevant support are highlighted in software research.
While state-of-the-art literature reveals how startups develop their software,
the reasons why they adopt these activities are underexplored. Objective: This
study investigates the tactics behind software engineering (SE) activities by
analyzing key engineering events during startup journeys. We explore how
entrepreneurial mindsets may be associated with SE knowledge areas and with
each startup case. Method: Our theoretical foundation is based on causation and
effectuation models. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 software
startups. We used two-round open coding and thematic analysis to describe and
identify entrepreneurial software development patterns. Additionally, we
calculated an effectuation index for each startup case. Results: We identified
621 events merged into 32 codes of entrepreneurial logic in SE from the sample.
We found a systemic occurrence of the logic in all areas of SE activities.
Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Technical Debt (TD), and Customer Involvement
(CI) tend to be associated with effectual logic, while testing activities at
different levels are associated with causal logic. The effectuation index
revealed that startups are either effectuation-driven or mixed-logics-driven.
Conclusions: Software startups fall into two types that differentiate between
how traditional SE approaches may apply to them. Effectuation seems the most
relevant and essential model for explaining and developing suitable SE
practices for software startups.

However, humans have various preferences on balancing between task performance

intricacy in the interplay between complex fluid flows and nonlinear structural
deformations that accompany the phenomenology of slamming, a general
engineering theory in slamming has yet to be uncovered, and so design relies on
specialized theories. In this paper, we propose one such theory for a design
case that has, until now, eluded a proper description. In pursuit of this
theory, we employ a specialized implicit, partitioned fluid-structural
interaction (FSI) simulation approach, in order to study the underlying

limited time budgets. In many real-time and embedded scenarios, only a few
iterations can be performed and traditional convergence metrics cannot be used
to evaluate performance in these non-asymptotic regimes. In this paper, we
examine the transient behavior of accelerated first-order optimization
algorithms. For convex quadratic problems, we employ tools from linear systems
theory to show that transient growth arises from the presence of non-normal
dynamics. We identify the existence of modes that yield an algebraic growth in
early iterations and quantify the transient excursion from the optimal solution
caused by these modes. For strongly convex smooth optimization problems, we
utilize the theory of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) to establish an
upper bound on the magnitude of the transient response of Nesterov's
accelerated algorithm. We show that both the Euclidean distance between the
optimization variable and the global minimizer and the rise time to the
transient peak are proportional to the square root of the condition number of
the problem. Finally, for problems with large condition numbers, we demonstrate
tightness of the bounds that we derive up to constant factors.

nanoantennas can be leveraged to create sub-femtosecond, PHz-scale electronics
for optical-field detection. One application that is of particular interest is
the detection of an incident optical pulse's carrier-envelope phase. Such
carrier-envelope-phase detection requires few-cycle, broadband optical
excitation where the resonant properties of the nanoantenna can strongly alter
the response of the near field in time. Little quantitative investigation has
been performed to understand how the geometry and resonant properties of the
antennae should be tuned to enhance the carrier-envelope phase sensitivity and
signal to noise ratio. Here we examine how the geometry and resonance frequency
of planar plasmonic nanoantennas can be engineered for enhancing the emitted
carrier-envelope-phase-sensitive photocurrent when driven by a few-cycle
optical pulse. We find that with the simple addition of curved sidewalls
leading to the apex, and proper tuning of the resonance wavelength, the net
CEP-sensitive current per nanoantenna can be improved by $5$-$10\times$, and
the signal-to-noise-ratio by $50$-$100\times$ relative to simple triangular
antennas operated on resonance. Our findings will inform the next generation of
nanoantenna designs for emerging applications in ultrafast photoelectron
metrology and petahertz electronics.

evaluating navigation performance for mobile robots. Several related works on
navigation have used Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) as the primary
method of evaluating the path an agent makes to a goal location, but SPL is
limited in its ability to properly evaluate agents with complex dynamics. In
contrast, SCT explicitly takes the agent's dynamics model into consideration,
and aims to accurately capture how well the agent has approximated the fastest
navigation behavior afforded by its dynamics. While several embodied navigation
works use point-turn dynamics, we focus on unicycle-cart dynamics for our
agent, which better exemplifies the dynamics model of popular mobile robotics
platforms (e.g., LoCoBot, TurtleBot, Fetch, etc.). We also present
RRT*-Unicycle, an algorithm for unicycle dynamics that estimates the fastest
collision-free path and completion time from a starting pose to a goal location
in an environment containing obstacles. We experiment with deep reinforcement
learning and reward shaping to train and compare the navigation performance of
agents with different dynamics models. In evaluating these agents, we show that
in contrast to SPL, SCT is able to capture the advantages in navigation speed a
unicycle model has over a simpler point-turn model of dynamics. Lastly, we show
that we can successfully deploy our trained models and algorithms outside of
simulation in the real world. We embody our agents in an real robot to navigate
an apartment, and show that they can generalize in a zero-shot manner.

expectation that a robot executes tasks with desired performance. A
higher-level trust increases the willingness of a human operator to assign
tasks, share plans, and reduce the interruption during robot executions,
thereby facilitating human-robot integration both physically and mentally.
However, due to real-world disturbances, robots inevitably make mistakes,
decreasing human trust and further influencing collaboration. Trust is fragile
and trust loss is triggered easily when robots show incapability of task
executions, making the trust maintenance challenging. To maintain human trust,
in this research, a trust repair framework is developed based on a
human-to-robot attention transfer (H2R-AT) model and a user trust study. The
rationale of this framework is that a prompt mistake correction restores human
trust. With H2R-AT, a robot localizes human verbal concerns and makes prompt
mistake corrections to avoid task failures in an early stage and to finally
improve human trust. User trust study measures trust status before and after
the behavior corrections to quantify the trust loss. Robot experiments were
designed to cover four typical mistakes, wrong action, wrong region, wrong
pose, and wrong spatial relation, validated the accuracy of H2R-AT in robot
behavior corrections; a user trust study with $252$ participants was conducted,
and the changes in trust levels before and after corrections were evaluated.
The effectiveness of the human trust repairing was evaluated by the mistake
correction accuracy and the trust improvement.

choose designs that maximize the information gathering. For implicit models,
where the likelihood is intractable but sampling is possible, conventional BED
methods have difficulties in efficiently estimating the posterior distribution
and maximizing the mutual information (MI) between data and parameters. Recent
work proposed the use of gradient ascent to maximize a lower bound on MI to
deal with these issues. However, the approach requires a sampling path to
compute the pathwise gradient of the MI lower bound with respect to the design
variables, and such a pathwise gradient is usually inaccessible for implicit
models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages recent
advances in stochastic approximate gradient ascent incorporated with a smoothed
variational MI estimator for efficient and robust BED. Without the necessity of
pathwise gradients, our approach allows the design process to be achieved
through a unified procedure with an approximate gradient for implicit models.
Several experiments show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, and
significantly improves the scalability of BED in high-dimensional problems.

(UAV-BS) that provides communication services to a cluster of users on the
ground while the geographical characteristics (e.g., location and boundary) of
the cluster, the geographical locations of the users, and the characteristics
of the radio environment are unknown. UAVBS solely exploits the received signal
strengths (RSS) from the users and accordingly chooses its (continuous) 3-D
speed to constructively navigate, i.e., improving the transmitted data rate. To
compensate for the lack of a model, we adopt policy gradient deep reinforcement
learning. As our approach does not rely on any particular information about the
users as well as the radio environment, it is flexible and respects the privacy
concerns. Our experiments indicate that despite the minimum available
information the UAV-BS is able to distinguish between high-rise (often
non-line-of-sight dominant) and sub-urban (mainly line-of-sight dominant)
environments such that in the former (resp. latter) it tends to reduce (resp.
increase) its height and stays close (resp. far) to the cluster. We further

combines the concepts of high transitivity or clustering with a low average
path length, is ubiquitous for networks obtained from a variety of disciplines
including social sciences, biology, neuroscience, and ecology. However, we find
three shortcomings of the currently popular definition and detection methods
rendering the concept less powerful. First, the classical definition combines
high transitivity with a low average path length in a rather ad-hoc fashion
which confounds the two separate aspects. We find that in several cases,
networks get flagged as ""small world"" by the current methodology solely because
of their high transitivity. Second, the detection methods lack a formal
statistical inference, and third, the comparison is typically performed against
simplistic random graph models as the baseline which ignores well-known network
characteristics. We propose three innovations to address these issues. First,
we decouple the properties of high transitivity and low average path length as
separate events to test for. Second, we define the property as a statistical
test between a suitable null model and a superimposed alternative model. Third,
the test is performed using parametric bootstrap with several null models to
allow a wide range of background structures in the network. In addition to the
bootstrap tests, we also propose an asymptotic test under the
Erd\""{o}s-Ren\'{y}i null model for which we provide theoretical guarantees on
the asymptotic level and power. Applying the proposed methods on a large number
of network datasets, we uncover new insights about their small-world property.

  Signaling Overhead",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Power allocation in spectrum sharing systems is challenging due to excessive
interference that the secondary system could impose on the primary system.
Therefore, an interference threshold constraint is considered to regulate the
secondary system's activity. However, the primary receivers should measure the
interference and inform the secondary users accordingly. These cause design
complexities, e.g., due to transceiver's hardware impairments, and impose a
substantial signaling overhead. We set our main goal to mitigate these
requirements in order to make the spectrum sharing systems practically
feasible. To cope with the lack of a model we develop a coexisting deep
reinforcement learning approach for continuous power allocation in both
systems. Importantly, via our solution, the two systems allocate power merely
based on geographical location of their users. Moreover, the inter-system
signaling requirement is reduced to exchanging only the number of primary users
that their QoS requirements are violated. We observe that compared to a
centralized agent that allocates power based on full (accurate) channel
information, our solution is more robust and strictly guarantees QoS
requirements of the primary users. This implies that both systems can operate
simultaneously with almost-zero inter-system signaling overhead.

measures. Fast neutron detection with organic scintillators has been widely
used for various nuclear applications and homeland security. One of the
significant attributes of special nuclear materials (SNM) is the high
multiplicity events in a short period of time. The time distributions of
neutron and gamma-rays events for the plutonium metal plates designed as fuel
plates for the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Zero Power were measured with
the Fast Neutron Multiplicity Counter (FNMC) consisting of 8 EJ-309 liquid
scintillators and 8 stilbene detectors. Since the neutron correlated counts
within the coincidence window of 40 ns are related to 240Pu effective mass of
plutonium metal plates we investigated the randomness of the measured neutron
and gamma-rays events. To access such information, we resort to complexity
measures in the hope of being able to connect complexity values with the
reliability of detection. That was done through (i) application of Kolmogorov
complexity (KC) and its derivatives [Kolmogorov spectrum and its highest value
(KCM) and running complexity (RKC)] and (ii) establishing the breaking point
after which there exists a sharp drop in the running Kolmogorov complexity of
the neutron and gamma-rays time series. It was found that the complexity of all
the time series detected from the sample with 5, 9, 11, 13, and 15 plutonium
plates had the high almost identical values of KC while the sample with 3
plates had by one-third smaller KC values than all the others. These
calculations were supplemented by the Lypaunov exponents for a time series and
the NIST tests. The low KC values can be addressed to the different sources of
uncertainties in measuring procedure with the sample consisting of three

computed by a least squares method. The randomly-assigned coefficients in ELM
are known to influence its performance and accuracy significantly. In this
paper we present a modified batch intrinsic plasticity (modBIP) method for
pre-training the random coefficients in the ELM neural networks. The current
method is devised based on the same principle as the batch intrinsic plasticity
(BIP) method, namely, by enhancing the information transmission in every node
of the neural network. It differs from BIP in two prominent aspects. First,
modBIP does not involve the activation function in its algorithm, and it can be
applied with any activation function in the neural network. In contrast, BIP
employs the inverse of the activation function in its construction, and
requires the activation function to be invertible (or monotonic). The modBIP
method can work with the often-used non-monotonic activation functions (e.g.
Gaussian, swish, Gaussian error linear unit, and radial-basis type functions),
with which BIP breaks down. Second, modBIP generates target samples on random
intervals with a minimum size, which leads to highly accurate computation
results when combined with ELM. The combined ELM/modBIP method is markedly more
accurate than ELM/BIP in numerical simulations. Ample numerical experiments are
presented with shallow and deep neural networks for function approximation and
boundary/initial value problems with partial differential equations. They
demonstrate that the combined ELM/modBIP method produces highly accurate
simulation results, and that its accuracy is insensitive to the
random-coefficient initializations in the neural network. This is in sharp
contrast with the ELM results without pre-training of the random coefficients.

fractionalized insulating charge-density-wave (CDW) states. In agreement with
earlier work (Jiang, Devereaux, and Kivelson, Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf 119}$,

gapped QSL, light doping leads to CDW long-range order with a pattern that
depends on lattice geometry and doping concentration such that there is one
doped-hole per CDW unit cell, while the spin-spin correlations remain
short-ranged. Alternatively, this state can be viewed as a stripe crystal or
Wigner crystal of spinless holons, rather than doped holes. From here, by
studying generalized versions of the $t$-$J$ model, we extend these results to
light doping of other types of QSLs, including critical and chiral QSLs. Our
results suggest that doping these QSLs also leads to insulating states with
long-range CDW orders. While the superconducting correlations are short-ranged,
they can be significantly enhanced by second-neighbor electron hopping. The
relevance of our numerical results to Kagome materials is also discussed.

diseases. Due to their co-occurring nature, the course of one comorbidity is
often highly dependent on the course of the other disease and, hence,
treatments can have significant spill-over effects. Despite the prevalence of
comorbidities among patients, a comprehensive statistical framework for
modeling the longitudinal dynamics of comorbidities is missing. In this paper,
we propose a probabilistic model for analyzing comorbidity dynamics over time
in patients. Specifically, we develop a coupled hidden Markov model with a
personalized, non-homogeneous transition mechanism, named Comorbidity-HMM. The
specification of our Comorbidity-HMM is informed by clinical research: (1) It
accounts for different disease states (i. e., acute, stable) in the disease
progression by introducing latent states that are of clinical meaning. (2) It
models a coupling among the trajectories from comorbidities to capture
co-evolution dynamics. (3) It considers between-patient heterogeneity (e. g.,
risk factors, treatments) in the transition mechanism. Based on our model, we
define a spill-over effect that measures the indirect effect of treatments on
patient trajectories through coupling (i. e., through comorbidity
co-evolution). We evaluated our proposed Comorbidity-HMM based on 675 health
trajectories where we investigate the joint progression of diabetes mellitus
and chronic liver disease. Compared to alternative models without coupling, we
find that our Comorbidity-HMM achieves a superior fit. Further, we quantify the
spill-over effect, that is, to what extent diabetes treatments are associated
with a change in the chronic liver disease from an acute to a stable disease
state. To this end, our model is of direct relevance for both treatment
planning and clinical research in the context of comorbidities.

Hamiltonians. For the kinetic energy operator, the critical concept
facilitating the reduction in model complexity is the idea of position

yields exponential improvement in space complexity when compared to classical
computing. Encoding with a binary reflected Gray code, and a Hamming distance 2
Gray code yields the additional effect of reducing the spin model down to the
XZ and transverse Ising model respectively. We also identify the bijective
mapping between diagonal unitaries and the Walsh series, producing the mapping
of any real potential to a series of $k$-local Ising models through the fast
Walsh transform. Finally, in a finite volume, we provide some numerical
evidence to support the claim that the total time needed for adiabatic
evolution is protected by the infrared cutoff of the system. As a result,
initial state preparation from a free-field wavefunction to an interacting
system is expected to exhibit polynomial time complexity with volume and
constant scaling with respect to lattice discretization for all encodings. For
the Hamming distance 2 Gray code, the evolution starts with the transverse
Hamiltonian before introducing penalties such that the low lying spectrum
reproduces the energy levels of the Laplacian. The adiabatic evolution of the
penalty Hamiltonian is therefore sensitive to the ultraviolet scale. It is
expected to exhibit polynomial time complexity with lattice discretization, or
exponential time complexity with respect to the number of qubits given a fixed
volume.

identify a strong decoherence regime wherein the decoherence time is shorter
than the standard correlation time, which varies as the inverse gap above the
groundstate. In this regime, we find that the freeze-out time
$\bar{t}\sim\tau^{{2\nu z}/({1+2\nu z})}$ for when the system falls out of

$\bar{\xi}\sim\tau^{\nu/({1+2\nu z})}$ show power-law scaling with respect to
the quench rate $1/\tau$, where the exponents depend on the correlation length
exponent $\nu$ and the dynamical exponent $z$ associated with the transition.
The universal exponents differ from those of standard Kibble-Zurek scaling. We
explicitly demonstrate this scaling behavior in the instance of a topological
transition in a Chern insulator system. We show that the freeze-out time scale
can be probed from the relaxation of the Hall conductivity. Furthermore, on
introducing disorder to break translational invariance, we demonstrate how
quenching results in regions of imbalanced excitation density characterized by

maintain translational invariance for detection of features, but in their
architecture they do not explicitly maintain a representation of the locations
of the features relative to each other. This means they do not represent two
instances of the same object in different orientations the same way, like
humans do, and so training them often requires extensive data augmentation and
exceedingly deep networks. A team at Google Brain recently made news with an
attempt to fix this problem: Capsule Networks. While a normal CNN works with
scalar outputs representing feature presence, a CapsNet works with vector
outputs representing entity presence. We want to stress test CapsNet in various
incremental ways to better understand their performance and expressiveness. In
broad terms, the goals of our investigation are: (1) test CapsNets on datasets
that are like MNIST but harder in a specific way, and (2) explore the internal
embedding space and sources of error for CapsNets.

whether it stems from disorder or from fundamental interactions such as

from the hole to the electron doped side, we see an increased strength of

inverse quasiparticle lifetime. These results suggest that electronic

occur on edges of a communication network of which the topology is known. In
this paper, we first revisit and explore the framework of LNEC coding, and then
unify two well-known LNEC coding approaches. Furthermore, by developing a
graph-theoretic approach to the framework of LNEC coding, we obtain a
significantly enhanced characterization of the error correction capability of
LNEC codes in terms of the minimum distances at the sink nodes. In LNEC coding,
the minimum required field size for the existence of LNEC codes, in particular
LNEC maximum distance separable (MDS) codes which are a type of most important
optimal codes, is an open problem not only of theoretical interest but also of
practical importance, because it is closely related to the implementation of
the coding scheme in terms of computational complexity and storage requirement.
By applying the graph-theoretic approach, we obtain an improved upper bound on
the minimum required field size. The improvement over the existing results is
in general significant. The improved upper bound, which is graph-theoretic,
depends only on the network topology and requirement of the error correction
capability but not on a specific code construction. However, this bound is not
given in an explicit form. We thus develop an efficient algorithm that can
compute the bound in linear time. In developing the upper bound and the
efficient algorithm for computing this bound, various graph-theoretic concepts
are introduced. These concepts appear to be of fundamental interest in graph
theory and they may have further applications in graph theory and beyond.

prioritize and assign bugs to developers who will provide the fixes. However,
studies have shown that BR fields often contain incorrect information that need
to be reassigned, which delays the bug fixing process. There exist approaches
for predicting whether a BR field should be reassigned or not. These studies
use mainly BR descriptions and traditional machine learning algorithms (SVM,
KNN, etc.). As such, they do not fully benefit from the sequential order of
information in BR data, such as function call sequences in BR stack traces,
which may be valuable for improving the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach, called EnHMM, for predicting the reassignment of BR
fields using ensemble Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), trained on stack traces.
EnHMM leverages the natural ability of HMMs to represent sequential data to
model the temporal order of function calls in BR stack traces. When applied to
Eclipse and Gnome BR repositories, EnHMM achieves an average precision, recall,
and F-measure of 54%, 76%, and 60% on Eclipse dataset and 41%, 69%, and 51% on

a recent approach in the field, we found that the average F-measure score of
EnHMM improves the average F-measure of Im.ML.KNN by 6.80% and improves the
average recall of Im.ML.KNN by 36.09%. However, the average precision of EnHMM

still under development. This work reports a dual-modulation-frequency TDTR
mapping technique to visualize the thermal conduction across buried
semiconductor interfaces for beta-Ga2O3-SiC samples. Both the beta-Ga2O3
thermal conductivity and the buried beta-Ga2O3-SiC thermal boundary conductance
(TBC) are visualized for an area of 200 um x 200 um. Areas with low TBC values
( smaller than 20 MW/m2-K) are successfully identified on the TBC map, which
correspond to weakly bonded interfaces caused by high-temperature annealing.
The steady-state temperature rise (detector voltage), usually ignored in TDTR
measurements, is found to be able to probe TBC variations of the buried
interfaces without the limit of thermal penetration depth. This technique can
be applied to detect defects/voids in deeply buried heterogeneous interfaces
non-destructively, and also opens a door for the visualization of thermal
conductance in nanoscale nonhomogeneous structures.

find a safe vector using a spectrogram subspace projection operation. This
operation minimizes the chordal distance adjustment between spectrograms with
an additional regularization term. Third, we synthesize a spectrogram with such
a safe vector using a novel GAN architecture trained with Sobolev integral

and the total number of learned modes, we impose an additional constraint on
the generator network. Finally, we reconstruct the signal from the synthesized
spectrogram and the Griffin-Lim phase approximation technique. We evaluate the
proposed defense approach against six strong white and black-box adversarial
attacks benchmarked on DeepSpeech, Kaldi, and Lingvo models. Our experimental
results show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art defense

state-of-the-art speech-to-text systems, namely DeepSpeech, Kaldi, and Lingvo.
Our approach is based on developing an extension for the conventional
distortion condition of the adversarial optimization formulation using the
Cram\`er integral probability metric. Minimizing over this metric, which
measures the discrepancies between original and adversarial samples'
distributions, contributes to crafting signals very close to the subspace of
legitimate speech recordings. This helps to yield more robust adversarial
signals against playback over-the-air without employing neither costly
expectation over transformation operations nor static room impulse response
simulations. Our approach outperforms other targeted and non-targeted
algorithms in terms of word error rate and sentence-level-accuracy with
competitive performance on the crafted adversarial signals' quality. Compared
to seven other strong white and black-box adversarial attacks, our proposed
approach is considerably more resilient against multiple consecutive playbacks
over-the-air, corroborating its higher robustness in noisy environments.

object with its environment, i.e., extrinsic to the robot.
  We explore the key role that distributed tactile sensing plays in localizing
contacts external to the robot, in contrast to the role that aggregated
force/torque measurements play in localizing contacts on the robot. When in
contact with the environment, an object will move in accordance with the
kinematic and possibly frictional constraints imposed by that contact. Small
motions of the object, which are observable with tactile sensors, indirectly
encode those constraints and the geometry that defines them.
  We formulate the extrinsic contact sensing problem as a constraint-based
estimation. The estimation is subject to the kinematic constraints imposed by
the tactile measurements of object motion, as well as the kinematic (e.g.,
non-penetration) and possibly frictional (e.g., sticking) constraints imposed
by rigid-body mechanics.
  We validate the approach in simulation and with real experiments on the case
studies of fixed point and line contacts.
  This paper discusses the theoretical basis for the value of distributed
tactile sensing in contrast to aggregated force/torque measurements. It also
provides an estimation framework for localizing environmental contacts with
potential impact in contact-rich manipulation scenarios such as assembling or
packing.

almost in one-stage fashion, which can be typically grouped into two
categories: 1) anchor-based approach: it first pre-defines a series of video
segment candidates (e.g., by sliding window), and then does classification for
each candidate; 2) anchor-free approach: it directly predicts the probabilities
for each video frame as a boundary or intermediate frame inside the positive
segment. However, both kinds of one-stage approaches have inherent drawbacks:
the anchor-based approach is susceptible to the heuristic rules, further
limiting the capability of handling videos with variant length. While the
anchor-free approach fails to exploit the segment-level interaction thus
achieving inferior results. In this paper, we propose a novel Boundary Proposal
Network (BPNet), a universal two-stage framework that gets rid of the issues
mentioned above. Specifically, in the first stage, BPNet utilizes an
anchor-free model to generate a group of high-quality candidate video segments
with their boundaries. In the second stage, a visual-language fusion layer is
proposed to jointly model the multi-modal interaction between the candidate and
the language query, followed by a matching score rating layer that outputs the
alignment score for each candidate. We evaluate our BPNet on three challenging
NLVL benchmarks (i.e., Charades-STA, TACoS and ActivityNet-Captions). Extensive

noiseless feedback, where the message bits stream into the encoder one by one
at random time instants. Similar to existing posterior matching schemes with
block encoding, the encoder in our work takes advantage of the channel feedback
to form channel inputs that contain the information the decoder does not yet
have, and that are distributed close to the capacity-achieving input
distribution, but dissimilar to the existing posterior matching schemes, the
encoder performs instantaneous encoding--it immediately weaves the new message
bits into a continuing transmission. A posterior matching scheme by Naghshvar
et al. partitions the source messages into groups so that the group posteriors
have a small-enough difference (SED) to the capacity-achieving distribution,
and transmits the group index that contains the actual message. Our code adopts
the SED rule to apply to the evolving message alphabet that contains all the
possible variable-length strings that the source could have emitted up to that
time. Our instantaneous SED code achieves better delay-reliability tradeoffs
than existing feedback codes over $2$-input DMCs: we establish this dominance
both by simulations and via an analysis comparing the performance of the
instantaneous SED code to Burnashev's reliability function. We also design a
low-complexity code for binary symmetric channels that we name the
instantaneous type set SED code with complexity $O(t^4)$. Simulation results
show that the gap in performance between the instantaneous SED code and the

the embeddings of ontological concepts and their corresponding instance-view
entities. The intra-view models are trained to capture the structured knowledge
of instance and ontology views in separate embedding spaces, with a
hierarchy-aware encoding technique enabled for ontologies with hierarchies. We
explore multiple representation techniques for the two model components and
investigate with nine variants of JOIE. Our model is trained on large-scale
knowledge bases that consist of massive instances and their corresponding
ontological concepts connected via a (small) set of cross-view links.
Experimental results on public datasets show that the best variant of JOIE
significantly outperforms previous models on instance-view triple prediction
task as well as ontology population on ontologyview KG. In addition, our model
successfully extends the use of KG embeddings to entity typing with promising
performance.

target domain data that has been supplemented by feature maps generated using
the Phase 1 model. Our model significantly improves performance in unseen test

particles with Stokes number $St \lesssim O(0.01)$ in moderately turbulent

we verify that the same results apply when turbulence is externally driven,
extending the relevance of our model to a wider class of particle-laden flows.
We find in particular that (i) the maximum particle concentration enhancement

R-PointHop first determines a local reference frame (LRF) for every point using
its nearest neighbors and finds local attributes. Next, R-PointHop obtains
local-to-global hierarchical features by point downsampling, neighborhood
expansion, attribute construction and dimensionality reduction steps. Thus,
point correspondences are built in hierarchical feature space using the nearest
neighbor rule. Afterwards, a subset of salient points with good correspondence
is selected to estimate the 3D transformation. The use of the LRF allows for
invariance of the hierarchical features of points with respect to rotation and
translation, thus making R-PointHop more robust at building point
correspondence, even when the rotation angles are large. Experiments are
conducted on the 3DMatch, ModelNet40, and Stanford Bunny datasets, which
demonstrate the effectiveness of R-PointHop for 3D point cloud registration.
R-PointHop's model size and training time are an order of magnitude smaller
than those of deep learning methods, and its registration errors are smaller,

has been attracting a great deal of attention in recent years, motivated by
their nontrivial responses and by a plethora of applications for sensing,
lasing, energy transfer/harvesting, topology and quantum networks.
Electromagnetics is an inherently non-Hermitian research area because all
materials are lossy, loss and gain distributions can be controlled with various
mechanisms, and the underlying systems are open to radiation. Therefore, the
recent developments in non-Hermitian physics offer exciting opportunities for a
broad range of basic research and engineering applications relevant to the
antennas and propagation community. In this work, we offer a tutorial geared at
introducing the unusual electromagnetic phenomena emerging in non-Hermitian
systems, with particular emphasis on a sub-class of these systems that obey
parity-time (PT) symmetry. We discuss the basic concepts behind this topic and
explore their implications for various phenomena. We first discuss the basic
features of P, T and PT operators applied to electromagnetic and quantum
mechanical phenomena. We then discuss the exotic response of PT-symmetric
electromagnetic structures and their opportunities, with particular attention
to singularities, known as exceptional points, emerging in these systems, and
their unusual scattering response.

correcting the telluric absorption lines by combining the advantages of long
slit spectroscopy. By rotating the slit, we observed the scientific object and
a nearby comparison star in one exposure, so that the spectra of both objects
should have the same telluric transmission spectrum. The telluric transmission
spectrum was constructed by dividing the observed spectrum of comparison star
by its stellar template, and was used to correct the telluric absorption lines
of the scientific object. Using the long slit spectrograph of Lijiang 2.4-meter
telescope, we designed a long-term spectroscopic observation strategy, and
finished a four-year spectroscopic monitoring for a pair of objects (an active
galactic nuclei and an non-varying comparison star). We applied this method to
correct the telluric absorption lines of the long-term monitored spectra by
Lijiang 2.4-meter telescope, and investigated the variation of the telluric
absorptions at Lijiang Observatory. We found that the telluric absorption
transparency is mainly modulated by the seasonal variability of the relative
humidity, airmass and seeing. Using the scatter of the [O~III] $\lambda$5007
fluxes emitted from the narrow-line region of active galactic nuclei as an
indicator, we found that the correction accuracy of the telluric absorption

Core of our system is a neural network trained as a forward model of cloth

the problem of planning with incomplete domain knowledge by means of an
explicit epistemic uncertainty signal. This signal is calculated from
prediction divergence between two instances of the forward model network and
used to avoid epistemic uncertainty during planning. Finally, we introduce
logic for handling restriction of grasp points to a discrete set of candidates,

We evaluate the system's mesh estimation, prediction, and planning ability on

optimization efficiently, among which projected Newton has been shown to have
best convergence rate and work well in both 2D and 3D applications. Traditional
Newton approach suffers from ill conditioning and indefiniteness of local
energy approximation. A crucial step in projected Newton is to fix this issue
by projecting energy Hessian onto symmetric positive definite (SPD) cone so as
to guarantee the search direction always pointing to decrease the energy
locally. Such step relies on time consuming eigen decomposition of element
Hessian, which has been addressed by several work before on how to obtain a

suggested configuring multiple sets of antenna modules at different locations

modules causes the problem of excessive power consumption and device costs. In
this study, a fast antenna and beam switching method termed Fast-ABS is

predict the best beam of other antenna modules. As such, unmasked antenna

switching to avoid the problem of poor quality or disconnection of

not all flares generate sunquakes. It is curious why some flares cause
sunquakes while others do not. Here we propose a hypothesis to explain the
disproportionate occurrence of sunquakes: during a flare's impulsive phase when
the flare's impulse acts upon the photosphere, delivered by shock waves,
energetic particles from higher atmosphere, or by downward Lorentz Force, a
sunquake tends to occur if the background oscillation at the flare footpoint
happens to oscillate downward in the same direction with the impulse from
above. To verify this hypothesis, we select 60 strong flares in Solar Cycle 24,
and examine the background oscillatory velocity at the sunquake sources during
the flares' impulsive phases. Since the Doppler velocity observations at
sunquake sources are usually corrupted during the flares, we reconstruct the
oscillatory velocity in the flare sites using helioseismic holography method
with an observation-based Green's function. A total of 24 flares are found to
be sunquake active, giving a total of 41 sunquakes. It is also found that in
3-5 mHz frequency band, 25 out of 31 sunquakes show net downward oscillatory
velocities during the flares' impulsive phases, and in 5-7 mHz frequency band,
33 out of 38 sunquakes show net downward velocities. These results support the
hypothesis that a sunquake more likely occurs when a flare impacts a
photospheric area with a downward background oscillation.

main constraint of communication channel. Recently, the chaotic baseband
wireless communication system (CBWCS) is promising to eliminate the
inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation. However, the
current technique is only capable of removing the partial effect of ISI, due to
only past decoded bits are available for the suboptimal decoding threshold
calculation. However, the future transmitting bits also contribute to the
threshold. The unavailable future information bits needed by the optimal
decoding threshold are an obstacle to further improve the bit error rate (BER)
performance. Different from the previous method using echo state network (ESN)
to predict one future information bit, the proposed method in this paper
predicts the optimal threshold directly using ESN. The proposed ESN-based
threshold prediction method simplifies the symbol decoding operation by
removing the threshold calculation from the transmitting symbols and channel
information, which achieves better BER performance as compared to the previous
method. The reason for this superior result lies in two folds, first, the
proposed ESN is capable of using more future symbols information conveyed by
the ESN input to get more accurate threshold; second, the proposed method here
does not need to estimate the channel information using Least Square method,
which avoids the extra error caused by inaccurate channel information
estimation. By this way, the calculation complexity is decreased as compared to
the previous method. Simulation results and experiment based on a wireless
open-access research platform under a practical wireless channel, show the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

The structural parameters (lattice constants, volume, and atomic positions) are
observed to be consistent with earlier results. The band structure and density
of states (DOS) are used to explore the metallic conductivity, anisotropic
electrical conductivity, and the dominant role of Zr-d states to the electrical
conductivity. Analysis of the peaks in the DOS and charge density mapping (CDM)
of Zr2SeC and Zr2SC revealed the possible variation of the mechanical
properties and hardness among them. The mechanical stability has been checked
using elastic constants. The values of the elastic constants, elastic moduli
and hardness parameters of Zr2SeC are found to be lowered than those of Zr2SC.
The anisotropic behavior of the mechanical properties has been studied and
analyzed. Technologically important thermodynamic properties such as the
thermal expansion coefficient, Debye temperature, entropy, heat capacity at
constant volume, Gruneisen parameter along with volume and Gibbs free energy
are investigated as a function of both temperature (0 to 1600 K) and pressure
(0 to 50 GPa). Besides, the {\Theta}D, minimum thermal conductivity (Kmin),
melting point (Tm), and {\gamma} have also been calculated at room temperature
and found to be lowered for Zr2SeC compared to Zr2SC owing to their close
relationship with the mechanical parameters. The value of the {\Theta}D, Kmin,

dielectric constant (real and imaginary part), refractive index, extinction

any connected initial configuration where a subgraph induced by all robot nodes
(nodes where a robot exists) constitutes one connected graph, robots reach a
configuration such that the maximum distance between two robots is minimized.
For the case of seven robots, gathering is achieved when one robot has six
adjacent robot nodes (they form a shape like a hexagon). In this paper, we aim
to clarify the relationship between the capability of robots and the
solvability of gathering on a triangular grid. In particular, we focus on
visibility range of robots. To discuss the solvability of the problem in terms
of the visibility range, we consider strong assumptions except for visibility
range. Concretely, we assume that robots are fully synchronous and they agree
on the direction and orientation of the x-axis, and chirality in the triangular
grid. In this setting, we first consider the weakest assumption about
visibility range, i.e., robots with visibility range 1. In this case, we show
that there exists no collision-free algorithm to solve the gathering problem.
Next, we extend the visibility range to 2. In this case, we show that our
algorithm can solve the problem from any connected initial configuration. Thus,
the proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of visibility range.

how two body shapes interacting with obstacles affect turning and pitching
motions of an open-loop multi-legged robot and cockroaches during dynamic
locomotion. With a common cuboidal body, the robot was attracted towards
obstacles, resulting in pitching up and flipping-over. By contrast, with an
elliptical body, the robot was repelled by obstacles and readily traversed. The
animal displayed qualitatively similar turning and pitching motions induced by
these two body shapes. However, unlike the cuboidal robot, the cuboidal animal
was capable of escaping obstacle attraction and subsequent high pitching and
flipping over, which inspired us to develop an empirical pitch-and-turn
strategy for cuboidal robots. Considering the similarity of our self-propelled
body-obstacle interaction with part-feeder interaction in robotic part
manipulation, we developed a quasi-static potential energy landscape model to
explain the dependence of dynamic locomotion on body shape. Our experimental
and modeling results also demonstrated that obstacle attraction or repulsion is
an inherent property of locomotor body shape and insensitive to obstacle
geometry and size. Our study expanded the concept and usefulness of
terradynamic shapes for passive control of robot locomotion to traverse large
obstacles using physical interaction. Our study is also a step in establishing
an energy landscape approach to locomotor transitions.

However, a coherent driving on each TLS is used to stabilize the SS, which
raises a high requirement for experiments. We here propose a scheme to generate

over previous ones in the scaling relation of the SS parameter with the number
of the TLSs. The long-range correlation feature of the generated SS along the

sensing, e.g., improving the sensing efficiency of spatially unidentified weak
magnetic fields.

  This paper analyzes traces for millions of disks from production systems at

roadblock to disk-adaptive redundancy: transition IO under existing approaches
can consume 100% cluster IO continuously for several weeks. Building on the

initiating transitions proactively in a manner that avoids urgency while not

  based on Gaussian Scale Mixture Distributions","Accepted to International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and
  Statistics (AISTATS 2021)",,,,"stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the estimation of the causal effect under linear Structural Causal Models
(SCMs), it is common practice to first identify the causal structure, estimate
the probability distributions, and then calculate the causal effect. However,
if the goal is to estimate the causal effect, it is not necessary to fix a
single causal structure or probability distributions. In this paper, we first
show from a Bayesian perspective that it is Bayes optimal to weight (average)
the causal effects estimated under each model rather than estimating the causal
effect under a fixed single model. This idea is also known as Bayesian model
averaging. Although the Bayesian model averaging is optimal, as the number of
candidate models increases, the weighting calculations become computationally
hard. We develop an approximation to the Bayes optimal estimator by using
Gaussian scale mixture distributions.

onto the Milky Way (MW). In particular, the GCs of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf
galaxy are important probes of an on-going merger. Aims. Our main goal is to
search for new GC members of this dwarf galaxy using the VISTA Variables in the
Via Lactea Extended Survey (VVVX) near-infrared database combined with the Gaia
Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) optical database. Methods. We investigated all
VVVX-enabled discoveries of GC candidates in a region covering about 180 sq.
deg. toward the bulge and the Sgr dwarf galaxy. We used multiband point-spread
function photometry to obtain deep color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and
luminosity functions (LFs) for all GC candidates, complemented by accurate
Gaia-EDR3 proper motions (PMs) to select Sgr members and variability
information to select RR Lyrae which are potential GC members. Results. After
applying a strict PM cut to discard foreground bulge and disk stars, the CMDs
and LFs for some of the GC candidates exhibit well defined red giant branches
and red clump giant star peaks. We selected the best Sgr GCs, estimating their
distances, reddenings, and associated RR Lyrae. Conclusions. We discover 12 new
Sgr GC members, more than doubling the number of GCs known in this dwarf
galaxy. In addition, there are 11 other GC candidates identified that are
uncertain, awaiting better data for confirmation.

distributions of vegetation and the stability of these ecological systems under

population-potential landscape related to the stability of ecological states.
We illustrate the practical utility of this approach by analyzing a
forest-savanna model. Savanna, and Forest states coexist under certain
conditions, consistent with past theoretical work and empirical observations.
However, a new Grassland state, unseen in the corresponding deterministic
model, emerges as an alternative quasi-stable state under fluctuations,
providing a novel theoretical basis for the appearance of widespread grasslands
in some empirical analyses. The ecological dynamics are determined by both the
population-potential landscape gradient and the steady-state probability flux.
The flux quantifies the net input/output to the ecological system and therefore
the degree of nonequilibriumness. Landscape and flux together determine the
transitions between stable states characterized by dominant paths and switching
rates. The intrinsic potential landscape admits a Lyapunov function, which
provides a quantitative measure of global stability. We find that the average
flux, entropy production rate, and free energy have significant changes near
bifurcations under both finite and zero fluctuation. These may provide both
dynamical and thermodynamic origins of the bifurcations. We identified the
variances in observed frequency time traces, fluctuations and time
irreversibility as kinematic measures for bifurcations. This new framework
opens the way to characterize ecological systems globally, to uncover how they
change among states, and to quantify the emergence of new quasi-stable states
under stochastic fluctuations.

Bayesian probabilistic generative model called the prosodic hierarchical
Dirichlet process-hidden language model (Prosodic HDP-HLM). Prosodic HDP-HLM,
an extension of HDP-HLM, considers both prosodic and distributional cues within
a single integrative generative model. We conducted three experiments on

inference procedure for Prosodic HDP-HLM and show that Prosodic DAA can
discover words directly from continuous human speech signals using statistical

prosodic cues contribute to word segmentation more in naturally distributed

and virtual representations. Both stand-alone and descriptive digital twins
incorporate 3D geometric models, which are the physical representations of
objects in the digital replica. Digital twin applications are required to
rapidly update internal parameters with the evolution of their physical
counterpart. Due to an essential need for having high-quality geometric models
for accurate physical representations, the storage and bandwidth requirements
for storing 3D model information can quickly exceed the available storage and
bandwidth capacity. In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to geometric
change detection in the context of a digital twin. We address the issue through
a combined solution of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for motion detection,
YOLOv5 for object detection, and 3D machine learning for pose estimation. DMD
is applied for background subtraction, enabling detection of moving foreground
objects in real-time. The video frames containing detected motion are extracted
and used as input to the change detection network. The object detection
algorithm YOLOv5 is applied to extract the bounding boxes of detected objects
in the video frames. Furthermore, the rotational pose of each object is
estimated in a 3D pose estimation network. A series of convolutional neural
networks conducts feature extraction from images and 3D model shapes. Then, the
network outputs the estimated Euler angles of the camera orientation with
respect to the object in the input image. By only storing data associated with
a detected change in pose, we minimize necessary storage and bandwidth
requirements while still being able to recreate the 3D scene on demand.

Sound Recordings Archive (ESRA) is based, using ethnographic recordings from
ESRA next to additional pieces. In terms of pitch, tonal systems were compared
using Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), which clearly clusters Kachin and

Here we reconsider the model of stratified ejecta with energy profile of
$E(>\Gamma \beta)=E_0(\Gamma \beta)^{-k}$ as the origin of the afterglow light
curves of the burst, where $\Gamma$ and $\beta$ are the Lorentz factor and
speed of the ejecta, respectively. $k$ is the power-law slope of the energy
profile. We consider the ejecta are collimated into jets. Two kinds of jet
evolutions are investigated, including a lateral-spreading jet and a
non-lateral-spreading jet. We fit the multi-band afterglow light curves,
including the X-ray data at one thousand days post-burst, and find that both
the models of the spreading and non-spreading jets can fit the light curves
well, but the observed angular size of the source and the apparent velocity of
the flux centroid for the spreading jet model are beyond the observation
limits, while the non-spreading jet model meets the observation limits. Some of
the best-fit parameters for the non-spreading jet model, such as the number
density of the circumburst medium $\sim10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$ and the total jet
kinetic energy $E \sim 4.8\times 10^{51}$ erg, also appear plausible. The
best-fit slope of the jet energy profile is $k \sim 7.1$. Our results suggest
that the afterglow of GRB 170817A may arise from the stratified jet and that
the lateral spreading of the jet is not significant.

problem of open long-tailed HOI detection. Specifically, we introduce an object
fabricator to generate effective object representations, and then combine verbs

fabricator, we are able to generate large-scale HOI samples for rare and unseen

Though ComSat showed good performance in general, some problems took

has been studied extensively in the literature. However, the results on
convergence theory are based on technical proofs and difficult to interpret. It
is also often not clear how those results translate into the discrete,
numerical setting. In this paper we present a new strategy to study the
properties of a regularization method on the example of Tikhonov
regularization. The technique is based on the observation that Tikhonov
regularization approximates the unknown exact solution in the range of the
adjoint of the forward operator. This is closely related to the concept of
approximate source conditions, which we generalize to describe not only the
approximation of the unknown solution, but also noise-free and noisy data; all
from the same source space. Combining these three approximation results we
derive the well-known convergence results in a concise way and improve the
understanding by tightening the relation between concepts such as convergence
rates, parameter choice, and saturation. The new technique is not limited to
Tikhonov regularization, it can be applied also to iterative regularization,
which we demonstrate by relating Tikhonov regularization and Landweber
iteration. Because the Tikhonov functional is no longer the centrepiece of the
analysis, we can show that Tikhonov regularization can be used for
oversmoothing regularization. All results are accompanied by numerical
examples.

on images from one domain cannot generalise well when tested on images from a

because the data distribution between the two domains is different. Moreover,
creating annotation for every new modality is a tedious and time-consuming
task, which also suffers from high inter- and intra- observer variability.
Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods intend to reduce the gap between
source and target domains by leveraging source domain labelled data to generate
labels for the target domain. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) UDA
methods demonstrate degraded performance when there is insufficient data in
source and target domains. In this paper, we present a novel UDA method for
multi-modal cardiac image segmentation. The proposed method is based on
adversarial learning and adapts network features between source and target

integrates: a) entropy minimisation, b) output feature space alignment and c) a
novel point-cloud shape adaptation based on the latent features learned by the
segmentation model. We validated our method on two cardiac datasets by adapting
from the annotated source domain, bSSFP-MRI (balanced Steady-State Free

enforcing adversarial learning in different parts of the network, the proposed

been remarkably fruitful in physics, and especially in quantum mechanics. On a
mathematical level, symmetry groups single out a certain structure in the
Hilbert space that leads to a reduction. This structure is given by the
irreducible representations of the group, and in general it can be identified
with an operator algebra (a.k.a. C*-algebra or von Neumann algebra). The
primary focus of this thesis is the extension of the framework of reductions
from symmetries to operator algebras, and its applications in
finite-dimensional quantum mechanics. Finding the irreducible representations
structure is the principal problem when working with operator algebras. We will
therefore review the representation theory of finite-dimensional operator
algebras and elucidate this problem with the help of two novel concepts:
minimal isometries and bipartition tables. One of the main technical results
that we present is the Scattering Algorithm for analytical derivations of the
irreducible representations structure of operator algebras. For applications,
we will introduce a symmetry-agnostic approach to the reduction of dynamics
where we circumvent the non-trivial task of identifying symmetries, and
directly reduce the dynamics generated by a Hamiltonian. We will also consider
quantum state reductions that arise from operational constraints, such as the
partial trace or the twirl map, and study how operational constraints lead to
decoherence. Apart from that, we will extend the idea of reduction beyond
operator algebras to operator systems, and formulate a quantum notion of
coarse-graining that so far only existed in classical probability theory. We
will also characterize how the uncertainty principle transitions to the
classical regime under coarse-grained measurements and discuss the implications
in a finite-dimensional setting.

framework also allows us to rephrase the previously proposed $\mathbb{Z}_2$
index of PT and CP symmetric gapped phases beyond the realm of two-band models.
We apply this general formalism to a frictional shallow water model that is
found to exhibit 3-fold exceptional points associated with topological numbers
$\pm1$. For this model, we also show different non-Hermitian topological
transitions associated with these exceptional points, such as their merging and
a transition to a regime where propagation becomes forbidden.

wireless backhaul is expected to be an integral part of the 5G networks. While
this concept is nothing new, it was shortcoming in terms of performance

is no longer the foremost technology for backhauling. With the projected
densification of networks, wireless backhaul has become mandatory to use. There
are still challenges to be tackled if wireless backhaul is to be used
efficiently. Resource allocation, deployment, scheduling, power management and
energy efficiency are some of these problems. Wireless backhaul also acts as an
enabler for new technologies and improves some of the existing ones
significantly. To name a few, rural connectivity, satellite communication, and
mobile edge computing are some concepts for which wireless backhauling acts as
an enabler. Small cell usage with wireless backhaul presents different security
challenges. Governing bodies of cellular networks have standardization efforts
going on especially for the Integrated Acces-Backhaul (IAB) concept, and this
is briefly mentioned. Finally, wireless backhaul is also projected to be an
important part of the beyond 5G networks, and newly developed concepts such as
cell-free networking, ultra-massive MIMO, and extremely dense network show this

challenges, opportunities, and applications of wireless backhaul in 5G, while

response function (FRF) for all white matter populations and deconvolving this
FRF from the dMRI signal at each voxel to estimate the fODF. Variable fibre

Cartan-Hadamard manifold $ \mathbb{M}^n $, the isoperimetric inequality holds
with Euclidean optimal constant, and any set attaining equality is necessarily
isometric to a Euclidean ball. This conjecture was settled, with positive
answer, for $n \le 4$. It was also shown that its validity in dimension $n$
ensures that every $p$-Sobolev inequality ($ 1 < p < n $) holds on $
\mathbb{M}^n $ with Euclidean optimal constant. In this paper we address the
problem of classifying all Cartan-Hadamard manifolds supporting an optimal
function for the Sobolev inequality. We prove that, under the validity of the
$n$-dimensional Cartan-Hadamard conjecture, the only such manifold is $
\mathbb{R}^n $, and therefore any optimizer is an Aubin-Talenti profile (up to
isometries). In particular, this is the case in dimension $n \le 4$.
  Optimal functions for the Sobolev inequality are weak solutions to the
critical $p$-Laplace equation. Thus, in the second part of the paper, we
address the classification of radial solutions (not necessarily optimizers) to
such a PDE. Actually, we consider the more general critical or supercritical
equation \[ -\Delta_p u = u^q \, , \quad u>0 \, , \qquad \text{on }

finite-energy solution, then $\mathbb{M}^n$ is necessarily isometric to

model manifolds, we describe the asymptotic behavior of radial solutions not
lying in the energy space $\dot{W}^{1,p}(\mathbb{M}^n)$, studying separately

determine which RL algorithm is most fitting. In this work, we propose to avoid
this difficult decision entirely and incorporate a choice mechanism into our RL

hazards have routinely relied on the monitoring of ground motion, such

multiplicity of spatiotemporal scales and dynamical regimes. In particular,
there exist a precursory failure regime where two mesoscale mechanisms
coevolve, namely, the preferred transmission paths for force and damage.
Despite extensive studies, a formulation which can address their coevolution
not just in laboratory tests but also in large, uncontrolled field environments
has proved elusive. Here we address this problem by developing a slope
stability analytics framework which uses network flow theory and mesoscience to
model this coevolution and predict emergent kinematic clusters solely from
surface ground motion data. We test this framework on four data sets: one at
the laboratory scale using individual grain displacement data; three at the

ground-based radar in two mines and from space-borne radar for the 2017 Xinmo

turbulent flow is generated by placing a passive grid at the inlet of the

controlled by changing its downstream distance from the grid. The computational
framework is based on the immersed boundary method for dealing with arbitrary

turbulent flow is first characterised by means of the comparison with
well-known results for decaying turbulence and a scale-by-scale analysis. Then,
the flag-in-the-wind problem is revisited by exploring the effect of the
turbulence intensity on self-sustained flapping. Whilst the latter is still

  techniques",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning methods have made significant progress in ship detection in
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The pretraining technique is usually
adopted to support deep neural networks-based SAR ship detectors due to the
scarce labeled SAR images. However, directly leveraging ImageNet pretraining is
hardly to obtain a good ship detector because of different imaging perspective
and geometry. In this paper, to resolve the problem of inconsistent imaging
perspective between ImageNet and earth observations, we propose an optical ship
detector (OSD) pretraining technique, which transfers the characteristics of
ships in earth observations to SAR images from a large-scale aerial image
dataset. On the other hand, to handle the problem of different imaging geometry
between optical and SAR images, we propose an optical-SAR matching (OSM)
pretraining technique, which transfers plentiful texture features from optical
images to SAR images by common representation learning on the optical-SAR
matching task. Finally, observing that the OSD pretraining based SAR ship
detector has a better recall on sea area while the OSM pretraining based SAR
ship detector can reduce false alarms on land area, we combine the predictions
of the two detectors through weighted boxes fusion to further improve detection
results. Extensive experiments on four SAR ship detection datasets and two
representative CNN-based detection benchmarks are conducted to show the
effectiveness and complementarity of the two proposed detectors, and the
state-of-the-art performance of the combination of the two detectors. The
proposed method won the sixth place of ship detection in SAR images in 2020
Gaofen challenge.

full-field simulations on microstructures with inelastic constituents. We
discuss how to extend direct DMNs to account for varying fiber orientation, and
propose a simplified sampling strategy which significantly speeds up the

DMNs efficiently is crucial. We discuss dedicated techniques for exploiting
sparsity and high-performance linear algebra modules, and demonstrate the power

as an important driver of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. In order to
quantify the effects of particle precipitation on the atmosphere, reliable
global energy inputs on spatial scales commensurate with particle precipitation
variations are required. To that end, we have validated auroral electron
densities derived from the SSUSI data products for average electron energy and
electron energy flux by comparing them to EISCAT electron density profiles.
This comparison shows that SSUSI FUV observations can be used to provide
ionization rate and electron density profiles throughout the auroral region.
The SSUSI on board the DMSP Block 5D3 satellites provide nearly hourly, 3000 km
wide, 10 km x 10 km UV snapshots of auroral emissions. Here we use the
SSUSI-derived energies and fluxes as input to standard parametrizations in
order to obtain electron-density profiles in the E region (90--150 km), which
are then compared to EISCAT ground-based electron density measurements. We
compare the data from DMSP F17 and F18 to the Troms{\o} UHF radar profiles. We
find that differentiating between the magnetic local time (MLT) morning
(03:00--11:00 MLT) and evening (15:00--23:00 MLT) provides the best fit to the
ground-based data. The data agree well in the MLT morning sector using a
Maxwellian electron spectrum, while in the evening sector using a Gaussian
spectrum and accounting for backscattered electrons achieved optimum agreement
with EISCAT. Depending on the satellite and MLT, the median of the differences
varies between 0% and 20% above 105 km (F17) and $\pm$15% above 100 km (F18).
Because of the large density gradient below those altitudes, the relative
differences get larger, albeit without a substantially increasing absolute
difference, with virtually no statistically significant differences at the
1-sigma level.

efforts to integrate security in DevOps have resulted in the DevSecOps
paradigm, which is gaining significant interest from both industry and
academia. However, the adoption of DevSecOps in practice is proving to be a
challenge. Objective: This study aims to systemize the knowledge about the
challenges faced by practitioners when adopting DevSecOps and the proposed
solutions reported in the literature. We also aim to identify the areas that
need further research in the future. Method: We conducted a Systematic
Literature Review of 54 peer-reviewed studies. The thematic analysis method was
applied to analyze the extracted data. Results: We identified 21 challenges
related to adopting DevSecOps, 31 specific solutions, and the mapping between
these findings. We also determined key gap areas in this domain by holistically
evaluating the available solutions against the challenges. The results of the
study were classified into four themes: People, Practices, Tools, and
Infrastructure. Our findings demonstrate that tool-related challenges and
solutions were the most frequently reported, driven by the need for automation
in this paradigm. Shift-left security and continuous security assessment were
two key practices recommended for DevSecOps. Conclusions: We highlight the need
for developer-centered application security testing tools that target the
continuous practices in DevSecOps. More research is needed on how the
traditionally manual security practices can be automated to suit rapid software
deployment cycles. Finally, achieving a suitable balance between the speed of
delivery and security is a significant issue practitioners face in the
DevSecOps paradigm.

computer vision systems. While many 3D representations have been proposed, it
is still an unaddressed problem how to represent a dynamically changing 3D
object. In this paper, we introduce a compositional representation for 4D
captures, i.e. a deforming 3D object over a temporal span, that disentangles
shape, initial state, and motion respectively. Each component is represented by
a latent code via a trained encoder. To model the motion, a neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) is trained to update the initial state conditioned
on the learned motion code, and a decoder takes the shape code and the updated
state code to reconstruct the 3D model at each time stamp. To this end, we
propose an Identity Exchange Training (IET) strategy to encourage the network
to learn effectively decoupling each component. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep
learning based methods on 4D reconstruction, and significantly improves on
various tasks, including motion transfer and completion.

pretrained complex teacher model to a student model, so a smaller network can
replace a large teacher network at the deployment stage. To reduce the
necessity of training a large teacher model, the recent literatures introduced
a self-knowledge distillation, which trains a student network progressively to
distill its own knowledge without a pretrained teacher network. While
Self-knowledge distillation is largely divided into a data augmentation based
approach and an auxiliary network based approach, the data augmentation
approach looses its local information in the augmentation process, which
hinders its applicability to diverse vision tasks, such as semantic
segmentation. Moreover, these knowledge distillation approaches do not receive
the refined feature maps, which are prevalent in the object detection and
semantic segmentation community. This paper proposes a novel self-knowledge
distillation method, Feature Refinement via Self-Knowledge Distillation
(FRSKD), which utilizes an auxiliary self-teacher network to transfer a refined
knowledge for the classifier network. Our proposed method, FRSKD, can utilize
both soft label and feature-map distillations for the self-knowledge
distillation. Therefore, FRSKD can be applied to classification, and semantic
segmentation, which emphasize preserving the local information. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of FRSKD by enumerating its performance improvements in
diverse tasks and benchmark datasets. The implemented code is available at

the atomic charges is proportional to the Berry phase polarization; ii) Each
water molecule has a formal charge of zero. It turns out that the distribution
of molecular dipole moments in liquid water inferred from latent variables is
surprisingly similar to that obtained from maximally localized Wannier

matched by existing upper bounds up to log factors. We can also derive similar

energy gamma-ray emission from nearby star-forming galaxies are investigated.
In the previous work, we constructed a model to calculate luminosity and energy
spectrum of pion-decay gamma-ray emission produced by cosmic-ray interaction
with the interstellar medium (ISM), from four physical quantities of galaxies
[star formation rate (SFR), gas mass, stellar mass, and effective radius]. The
model is in good agreement with the observed GeV--TeV emission of several
nearby galaxies. Applying this model to nearby galaxies that are not yet
detected in TeV (mainly from the KINGFISH catalog), their hadronic gamma-ray
luminosities and spectra are predicted. We identify galaxies of the highest
chance of detection by CTA, including NGC 5236, M33, NGC 6946, and IC 342.
Concerning gamma-ray spectra, NGC 1482 is particularly interesting because our
model predicts that this galaxy is close to the calorimetric limit and its
gamma-ray spectral index in GeV--TeV is close to that of cosmic-ray protons
injected into ISM. Therefore this galaxy may be detectable by CTA even though
its GeV flux is below the {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope sensitivity limit.
In the TeV regime, most galaxies are not in the calorimetric limit, and the
predicted TeV flux is lower than that assuming a simple relation between the
TeV luminosity and SFR of M82 and NGC 253, typically by a factor of 15. This
means that a more sophisticated model beyond the calorimetric limit assumption
is necessary to study TeV emission from star-forming galaxies.

facilities or using different software.
  In this paper, we propose a way to reduce such differences by optimising the
filter used in analytical algorithms. These filters can be computed using a
wrapper routine around a black-box implementation of a reconstruction
algorithm, and lead to quantitatively similar reconstructions. We demonstrate
use cases for our approach by computing implementation-adapted filters for
several open-source implementations and applying it to simulated phantoms and
real-world data acquired at the synchrotron. Our contribution to a reproducible
reconstruction step forms a building block towards a fully reproducible
synchrotron tomography data processing pipeline.

biological and bio-inspired systems. Despite their fundamental and applied
significance, a detailed understanding of the stationary behaviour of nematic
liquid crystals (NLC-s) in cylindrical capillaries is still lacking. Here,
using numerical simulations based on the continuum theory of Leslie, Ericksen
and Parodi, we investigate stationary NLC flows within cylindrical capillaries
possessing homeotropic (normal) and uniform planar anchoring conditions. By
considering the material parameters of the flow-aligning NLC, 5CB, we report
that instead of the expected, unique director field monotonically approaching
the alignment angle over corresponding Ericksen numbers (dimensionless number
capturing viscous v/s elastic effects), a second solution emerges below a
threshold flow rate (or applied pressure gradient). We demonstrate that the
onset of the second solution, a nematodynamic bifurcation yielding
energetically degenerate director tilts at the threshold pressure gradient, can
be controlled by the surface anchoring and the flow driving mechanism
(pressure-driven or volume-driven). For homeotropic surface anchoring, this
alternate director field orients against the alignment angle in the vicinity of
the capillary center; while in the uniform planar case, the alternate director
field extends throughout the capillary volume, leading to reduction of the flow
speed with increasing pressure gradients. While the practical realization and
utilization of such nematodynamic bifurcations still await systematic
exploration, signatures of the emergent rheology have been reported previously
within microfluidic environments, under both homeotropic (Sengupta et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 048303, 2013) and planar anchoring conditions (Sengupta,

we developDeepOPG that breaks the summarization process into functional

a novel dental coherence module. We also leverage weak supervision labels to
improve detection results in a reinforcement learning scenario. Experiments
show high efficacy of DeepOPG on finding summarization, achieving an overall

averaging satisfies strong duality, which enables global solutions to be
obtained via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. However, generic
solvers for SDP are rather slow in practice, even on rotation averaging
instances of moderate size, thus developing specialised algorithms is vital. In
this paper, we present a fast algorithm that achieves global optimality called
rotation coordinate descent (RCD). Unlike block coordinate descent (BCD) which
solves SDP by updating the semidefinite matrix in a row-by-row fashion, RCD
directly maintains and updates all valid rotations throughout the iterations.
This obviates the need to store a large dense semidefinite matrix. We
mathematically prove the convergence of our algorithm and empirically show its
superior efficiency over state-of-the-art global methods on a variety of
problem configurations. Maintaining valid rotations also facilitates
incorporating local optimisation routines for further speed-ups. Moreover, our
algorithm is simple to implement; see supplementary material for a
demonstration program.

offers two models, Description Synthesis from Image Cue (DSIC) and Transformer

generation to fill the gaps in existing methods. These two models take
advantage of modern deep neural networks for visual feature extraction and text

textual captions extracted from input floor plan images with paragraphs. The

study aerosol formation during exhalation. The numerical model is first
validated with the simulations of Fujioka et al.(2008). and the result is in
reasonable agreement with their study. Furthermore, two rupture cases with and
without aerosol formation are contrasted and analyzed. It is found that the
injury on the epithelium in the case with aerosol formation is essentially the
same that of without aerosol formation even while the pressure drop in airway
increases by about 67%. Then extensive simulations are performed to investigate
the effects of pressure drop, thickness of liquid plug and film on aerosol size

calculating time dependent emission spectrum of interaction-powered transients.
We solve energy equations of electron-proton plasma in the shocked SN ejecta

incorporating the collisional relaxation and the comptonization of the
bremsstrahlung radiation. We compare our model to observations of Type IIn

observed optical and X-ray light curves can be consistently explained if clumpy

studies. For SN 2014C our model successfully reproduces the X-ray
bremsstrahlung component and the emergence of H$\alpha$ emission at 400 days
after explosion. Finally we find a parameter space where the supernova is
extremely X-ray bright, reaching $10^{43}$-$10^{44}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$ for up

capture the physics of the spacetime for radial coordinates up to a small
multiple $(>1)$ of the Schwarzschild radius. For larger radii, it will give an
excellent approximation to the spacetime geometry in the case of astrophysical
black holes $(M\ge M_{\astrosun})$, except at extremely large distances from
the horizon (exceeding the cosmic particle horizon). In the classroom, the
model may serve as a first exploration of non-stationary gravitational fields.
Several interesting predictions are developed. First, particles dropped early
enough before complete evaporation of the black hole cross its horizon as
easily as with an eternal black hole. Second, the Schwarzschild radius takes on
the properties of an apparent horizon, and the true event horizon of the black
hole is \emph{inside} of it, because light can escape from the shrinking
apparent horizon. Third, a particle released from rest close enough to the
apparent horizon is strongly repelled and may escape to infinity. An
interpretation is given, demonstrating that such a particle would be able to
compete, for a short time, in a race with a photon.

regular and restricted form making them behave more like Sturmian words than
general episturmian words. We present a method to evaluate the initial
nonrepetitive complexity of regular episturmian words extending the work of
Wojcik on Sturmian words. For this, we develop a theory of generalized
Ostrowski numeration systems and show how to associate with each episturmian
word a unique sequence of numbers written in this numeration system.
  The description of the initial nonrepetitive complexity allows us to obtain
novel results on the Diophantine exponents of regular episturmian words. We
prove that the Diophantine exponent of a regular episturmian word is finite if
and only if its directive word has bounded partial quotients. Moreover, we
prove that the Diophantine exponent of a regular episturmian word is strictly
greater than $2$ if the sequence of partial quotients is eventually at least
$3$.
  Given an infinite word $x$ over an integer alphabet, we may consider a real
number $\xi_x$ having $x$ as a fractional part. The Diophantine exponent of $x$
is a lower bound for the irrationality exponent of $\xi_x$. Our results thus
yield nontrivial lower bounds for the irrationality exponents of real numbers
whose fractional parts are regular episturmian words. As a consequence, we
identify a new uncountable class of transcendental numbers whose irrationality
exponents are strictly greater than $2$. This class contains an uncountable
subclass of Liouville numbers.

hallmark of the complex chemistry which governs cuprate superconductivity as
manifested in the celebrated superconducting domes as well as quantum
criticality taking place at precise compositions. The strange metal state,
where the resistivity varies linearly with temperature, has emerged as a
central feature in the normal state of cuprate superconductors. The ubiquity of
this behavior signals an intimate link between the scattering mechanism and
superconductivity. However, a clear quantitative picture of the correlation has
been lacking. Here, we report observation of quantitative scaling laws between
the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ and the scattering rate
associated with the strange metal state in electron-doped cuprate $\rm
La_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_4$ (LCCO) as a precise function of the doping level.
High-resolution characterization of epitaxial composition-spread films, which
encompass the entire overdoped range of LCCO has allowed us to systematically
map its structural and transport properties with unprecedented accuracy and
increment of $\Delta x = 0.0015$. We have uncovered the relations $T_{\rm
c}\sim(x_{\rm c}-x)^{0.5}\sim(A_1^\square)^{0.5}$, where $x_c$ is the critical
doping where superconductivity disappears on the overdoped side and
$A_1^\square$ is the scattering rate of perfect $T$-linear resistivity per
CuO$_2$ plane. We argue that the striking similarity of the $T_{\rm c}$ vs
$A_1^\square$ relation among cuprates, iron-based and organic superconductors
is an indication of a common mechanism of the strange metal behavior and
unconventional superconductivity in these systems.

extends previous work using this method for nonlinear ordinary differential
equations with an external source term. Now, the initial condition plays the
role of the source. The method is tested on three examples: a
reaction-diffusion-convection equation, the porous medium equation with growth
or decay, and the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation. A comparison is made with
three other methods: the Adomian decomposition method (ADM), the variational
iteration method (VIM), and the variational iteration method with Green
function (GVIM). As a physical application, a deterministic differential
equation is proposed for interface growth under shear, combining Burgers and
Kardar- Parisi-Zhang nonlinearities. Thermal noise is neglected. This model is
studied with Gaussian and space-periodic initial conditions. A detailed Fourier
analysis is performed and the analytic coefficients are compared with those of
ADM, VIM, GVIM, and standard perturbation theory. The BLUES method turns out to
be a worthwhile alternative to the other methods. The advantages that it offers
ensue from the freedom of choosing judiciously the linear part, with associated
Green function, and the residual containing the nonlinear part of the

are of heavy design with massive computation. However, the computation
resources of modern mobile devices are limited, which cannot easily support the
expensive cost. To this end, this paper explores a novel frequency-aware
dynamic network for dividing the input into multiple parts according to its
coefficients in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. In practice, the
high-frequency part will be processed using expensive operations and the
lower-frequency part is assigned with cheap operations to relieve the
computation burden. Since pixels or image patches belong to low-frequency areas
contain relatively few textural details, this dynamic network will not affect
the quality of resulting super-resolution images. In addition, we embed
predictors into the proposed dynamic network to end-to-end fine-tune the
handcrafted frequency-aware masks. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark
SISR models and datasets show that the frequency-aware dynamic network can be
employed for various SISR neural architectures to obtain the better tradeoff
between visual quality and computational complexity. For instance, we can
reduce the FLOPs of SR models by approximate 50% while preserving
state-of-the-art SISR performance.

combinatorial optimisation problems using quantum effects. D-Wave Systems has
released a production model of quantum annealing hardware. However, the
inherent noise and various environmental factors in the hardware hamper the
determination of optimal solutions. In addition, the freezing effect in regions
with weak quantum fluctuations generates outputs approximately following a
Gibbs--Boltzmann distribution at an extremely low temperature. Thus, a quantum
annealer may also serve as a fast sampler for the Ising spin-glass problem, and
several studies have investigated Boltzmann machine learning using a quantum
annealer. Previous developments have focused on comparing the performance in
the standard distance of the resulting distributions between conventional
methods in classical computers and sampling by a quantum annealer. In this
study, we focused on the performance of a quantum annealer as a generative
model. To evaluate its performance, we prepared a discriminator given by a
neural network trained on an a priori dataset. The evaluation results show a
higher performance of quantum annealing compared with the classical approach
for Boltzmann machine learning.

component in the design of efficient gas turbine combustors. Kinetic models
coupled to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide quick and efficient ways
to test the effect of operating conditions, fuel composition and combustor
design compared to physical experiments. However, detailed chemical kinetic
models are too computationally expensive for use in CFD. We propose a novel
data orientated three-step methodology to produce compact models that replicate
a target set of detailed model properties to a high fidelity. In the first
step, a reduced kinetic model is obtained by removing all non-essential species
from the detailed model containing 118 species using path flux analysis (PFA).
It is then numerically optimised to replicate the detailed model's prediction
in two rounds; First, to selected species (OH,H,CO and CH4) profiles in
perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) simulations and then re-optimised to the
detailed model's prediction of the laminar flame speed. This is implemented by
a purposely developed Machine Learned Optimisation of Chemical Kinetics (MLOCK)
algorithm. The MLOCK algorithm systematically perturbs all three Arrhenius
parameters for selected reactions and assesses the suitability of the new
parameters through an objective error function which quantifies the error in
the compact model's calculation of the optimisation target. This strategy is
demonstrated through the production of a 19 species and a 15 species compact
model for methane/air combustion. Both compact models are validated across a
range of 0D and 1D calculations across both lean and rich conditions and shows
good agreement to the parent detailed mechanism. The 15 species model is shown
to outperform the current state-of-art models in both accuracy and range of
conditions the model is valid over.

double-strangeness hypernuclei. All particle conversions in the strangeness
$S=-1,-2$ sectors are explicitly taken into account. In two-body space, such
transitions may lead to the coupling between states of identical particles and
of non-identical ones. Therefore, a careful consideration is required when
determining the combinatorial factors that connect the many-body potential
matrix elements and the free-space two-body potentials. Using second
quantization, we systematically derive the combinatorial factors in question
for $S=0,-1,-2$ sectors. As a first application, we use the J-NCSM to
investigate $\Lambda \Lambda$ s-shell hypernuclei based on hyperon-hyperon (YY)
potentials derived within chiral effective field theory at leading order (LO)
and up to next-to-leading order (NLO). We find that the LO potential overbinds
$^{\text{ }\text{ }\text{ } \text{}6}_{\Lambda \Lambda}\text{He}$ while the
prediction of the NLO interaction is close to experiment. Both interactions
also yield a bound state for $^{\text{ }\text{ }\text{ } \text{}5}_{\Lambda

in multimedia forensics. As forgery images and videos are usually compressed
into different formats such as JPEG and H264 when circulating on the Internet,
existing forgery-detection methods trained on uncompressed data often suffer
from significant performance degradation in identifying them. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel anti-compression facial forgery detection
framework, which learns a compression-insensitive embedding feature space
utilizing both original and compressed forgeries. Specifically, our approach
consists of three ideas: (i) extracting compression-insensitive features from
both uncompressed and compressed forgeries using an adversarial learning
strategy; (ii) learning a robust partition by constructing a metric loss that
can reduce the distance of the paired original and compressed images in the
embedding space; (iii) improving the accuracy of tampered localization with an
attention-transfer module. Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed
method is highly effective in handling both compressed and uncompressed facial
forgery images.

reproductive fitness. Paradoxically, larger cells replicate in less time than
smaller cells despite the fact that building a larger cell requires increased
quantities of raw materials and energy. This feat is primarily accomplished by
the massive over expression of ribosomes, which permits translation of mRNA
into protein, the limiting step in reproduction, to occur at a scale that would
be impossible were it not for the use of parallel processing. In computer
science, spatial parallelism is the distribution of work across the nodes of a
distributed-memory multicomputer system. Despite the fact that a non-negligible
fraction of artificial life research is grounded in formulations based on
spatially parallel substrates, there have been no examples of artificial
organisms that use spatial parallelism to replicate in less time than smaller
organisms. This paper describes artificial cells defined using a
combinator-based artificial chemistry that replicate in less time than smaller
cells. This is achieved by employing extra copies of programs implementing the
limiting steps in the process used by the cells to synthesize their component
parts. Significant speedup is demonstrated, despite the increased complexity of

activity that can trap the dynamics into a metastable state, confined to a
subextensive part of the network, before visiting an absorbing configuration.
Quasistationary (QS) method is a technique to deal with absorbing states for
finite sizes and has played a central role in the investigation of epidemic
processes on heterogeneous networks where localization is a hallmark. The
standard QS method possesses high computer and algorithmic complexity for large
systems besides parameters whose choice are not systematic. However, simpler
approaches, such as a reflecting boundary condition (RBC), are not able to
capture the localization effects as the standard QS method does. In the present
work, we propose a QS method that consists of reactivating nodes proportionally
to the time they were active along the preceding simulation. The method is
compared with the standard QS and RBC methods for the
susceptible-infected-susceptible model on complex networks, which is a
prototype of a dynamic process with strong and localization effects. We
verified that the method performs as well the as standard QS in all
investigated simulations, providing the same scaling exponents, epidemic
thresholds, and localized phases, thus overcoming the limitations of other
simpler approaches. We also report that the present method has significant
reduction of the computer and algorithmic complexity than the standard QS
methods. So, this method arises as a simpler and efficient tool to analyze
localization on heterogeneous structures through QS simulations.

in the first phase of activity, namely the convex spectra and compact

evolution of newly-born radio jets. Our observations show that over the next
few years of activity the GPS galaxies keep the convex shape of the spectrum,
while GPS quasars rapidly transform into flat-spectrum sources, which may
result in them not being recognized as young sources. The wide range of
bolometric luminosities, black hole masses and jet powers among the transient
sources indicates even greater population diversity in the group of young radio
objects. We also suggest that small changes of the accretion disc luminosity

by means of effective material parameters. Thereby, it allows to use a constant
mesh for the entire simulation and, thus, decreases the computational costs.
Based on Faraday's law of electrolysis, an effective dissolution level is
introduced, which describes the ratio of a dissolved volume and its
corresponding reference volume. This inner variable allows the modeling of the
complex dissolution process without the necessity of computationally expensive
remeshing by controlling the effective material parameters. Additionally, full
coupling of the thermoelectric problem is considered and its linearization and
numerical implementation are presented. The model shows good agreement with
analytical and experimental validation examples by yielding realistic results.
Furthermore, simulations of a pulsed electrochemical machining process yield a
process signature of the surface roughness related to the specific accumulated
electric charge. The numerical examples confirm the simulation's computational
efficiency and accurate modeling qualities.

improves the network performance by adding electronically controlled reflected

backscatter system, a device, named tag, communicates towards a reader by
backscattering the waves of an ambient source (such as a TV tower). However,
the tag's backscattered signal is weak and strongly interfered by the direct
signal from the ambient source. In this paper, we propose a new reconfigurable
intelligent surface assisted ambient backscatter system. The proposed surface
allows to control the reflection of an incident wave coming from the exact
source location towards the tag and reader locations (creating hot spots at
their locations), thanks to passive reflected beams from a predefined codebook.
A common phase-shift can also be applied to the beam. Thanks to these features,
we demonstrate experimentally that the performance of ambient backscatter

of the high accuracy needed, the fact that the telescope consists of two large

personnel present. We use a high-frequency (~300GHz) source which is relatively
close to the telescope aperture (<1/100th of the Fresnel distance) to minimize
atmospheric effects. The main receiver is in the receiver cabin and can be
moved under remote control to different positions, so that the wave-front

placed on the yoke provides a phase reference. The signals are combined in a
digital cross-correlation spectrometer. Scanning the telescope provides a map

make models of the reflectors with errors and calculate the patterns expected,
and then iterate to find the best match to the data. To do this we have
developed a fast and accurate method for calculating the patterns using the

the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation, and LTE
abundances were obtained for up to five more elements. For the first time we
present abundance of oxygen in Seg 1 S1 and S4, silicon in ComaBer S2 and Tri

Three stars in Segue 1, two stars in Coma Berenices, and Triangulum II star
have very low [Na/Mg] of -1.08 to -1.67 dex, which is usually attributed in the
literature to an odd-even effect produced by nucleosynthesis in massive
metal-free stars. We interpret this chemical property as a footprint of first
stars, which is not blurred due to a small number of nucleosynthesis events
that contributed to chemical abundance patterns of the sample stars. Our NLTE
abundances of Sr and Ba in Coma Berenices, Segue 1, and Triangulum II report on
lower [Sr/Ba] abundance ratio in the UFDs compared to that in classical dwarf
spheroidal galaxies and the Milky Way halo. However, in UFDs, just as in
massive galaxies, [Sr/Ba] is not constant and it can be higher than the pure
r-process ratio. We suggest a hypothesis of Sr production in metal-poor
binaries at the earliest epoch of galactic evolution.

diffusion MRI experimental designs which, rather than relying on
parameter-estimation metrics, directly measures quantitative task performance.
Traditional computational experimental design (CED) methods may be ill-suited
to experimental tasks, such as clinical classification, where outcome does not
depend on parameter-estimation accuracy or precision alone. Current assessment
metrics evaluate experiments' ability to faithfully recover microstructural
parameters rather than their task performance. The method we propose addresses
this shortcoming. For a given MRI experimental design, experiments are
simulated start-to-finish and task performance is computed from ROC curves and
associated summary metrics (e.g. AUC). Two experiments were performed: first, a
validation of the pipeline's task performance predictions against clinical
results, comparing in-silico predictions to real-world ROC/AUC; and second, a
demonstration of the pipeline's advantages over traditional CED approaches,
using two simulated clinical classification tasks. Comparison with clinical
datasets validates our method's predictions of (a) the qualitative form of ROC
curves, (b) the relative task performance of different experimental designs,
and (c) the absolute performance of each experimental design. Furthermore, we
show that our method outperforms traditional task-agnostic assessment methods,
enabling improved, more useful experimental design. Compared to current
approaches, such task-driven assessment is more likely to identify experimental
designs that perform well in practice. Our method is not limited to diffusion
MRI; the pipeline generalises to any task-based quantitative MRI application,
and provides the foundation for developing future task-driven end-to end CED
frameworks.

are interesting linear relationships between pressure and density and have been

place the bounds, we ensured that the energy density must remain positive, the
pressure must remain negative, and the EoS parameter must attain a value close
to $-1$ to make sure that the bounds respect the accelerated expansion of the
Universe and are also in harmony with the latest observational data. We report
that for both the models, suitable parameter spaces exist which satisfy the

encrypted data in the cloud. However, most of the existing SSE schemes focus on
the exact keyword query and cannot work well when the user only remembers the
substring of a keyword, i.e., substring-of-keyword query. This paper aims to
investigate this issue by proposing an efficient and privacy-preserving
substring-of-keyword query scheme over cloud. First, we employ the position
heap technique to design a novel tree-based index to match substrings with
corresponding keywords. Based on the tree-based index, we introduce our
substring-of-keyword query scheme, which contains two consecutive phases. The
first phase queries the keywords that match a given substring, and the second
phase queries the files that match a keyword in which people are really
interested. In addition, detailed security analysis and experimental results
demonstrate the security and efficiency of our proposed scheme.

(100's of nm) spectral bandwidths is essential to realize their full potential
as Doppler calibrators. However, published descriptions remain limited to small
bandwidths or short timespans. We present a $\sim6$ month broadband stability
monitoring campaign of the Fabry-P\'{e}rot etalon system deployed with the
near-infrared Habitable Zone Planet Finder spectrograph (HPF). We monitor the
wavelengths of each of $\sim3500$ resonant modes measured in HPF spectra of
this Fabry-P\'{e}rot etalon (free spectral range = 30 GHz, bandwidth = 820 -
1280 nanometers), leveraging the accuracy and precision of an electro-optic
frequency comb reference. These results reveal chromatic structure in the
Fabry-P\'{e}rot mode locations and in their evolution with time. We measure an
average drift on the order of 2 cm s $^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$, with local departures up
to $\pm5$ cm s $^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$. We discuss these behaviors in the context of
the Fabry-P\'{e}rot etalon mirror dispersion and other optical properties of
the system, and the implications for the use of similar systems for precise
Doppler measurements. Our results show that this system supports the wavelength
calibration of HPF at the $\lesssim10$ cm s $^{-1}$ level over a night and at
the $\lesssim30$ cm s $^{-1}$ level over $\sim10$ d. Our results also highlight
the need for long-term and spectrally-resolved study of similar systems that

first result is a description of these orbits: parametrization, dimensions,
closure relations, and cover relations. Specifically, the orbits are
parametrized by certain pairs of partial permutations.
  Each orbit in $\mathfrak{X}$ gives rise to a conormal bundle. As in the

define a so-called symmetrized Steinberg map, respectively an exotic Steinberg

subinstruments of SPHERE/VLT. With polarimetry and photometry based on
reference star differential imaging, we were able to measure the linearly
polarized intensity and the total intensity of the light scattered by the

of multiple light scattering by the disk surface to derive constraints for
three scattering parameters of the dust: the maximum polarization of $P_{\rm
max}$, the asymmetry parameter $g$, and the single-scattering albedo $\omega$.
We measure a reflected total intensity of $51.4\pm1.5$ mJy and $206\pm12$ mJy
and a polarized intensity of $11.3\pm0.3$ mJy and $55.1\pm3.3$ mJy in the VBB

polarization that varies between $28\%$ on the far side of the disk and $17\%$
on the near side. The disk shows a red color for the scattered light intensity
and the polarized intensity, which are about twice as high in the near-infrared
when compared to the visual. We determine with model calculations the
scattering properties of the dust particles and find evidence for strong
forward scattering ($g\approx 0.5-0.75$), relatively low single-scattering
albedo ($\omega \approx 0.2-0.5$), and high maximum polarization ($P_{\rm max}
\approx 0.5-0.75$) at the surface on the far side of the disk for both observed
wavelengths. The optical parameters indicate the presence of large aggregate
dust particles, which are necessary to explain the high maximum polarization,
the strong forward-scattering nature of the dust, and the observed red disk
color.

the optimal allocation of labels across training tasks may reduce costs. Given
a fixed budget of labels, should we use a small number of highly labelled

some tasks and less to others? We show that: 1) If tasks are homogeneous, there
is a uniform optimal allocation, whereby all tasks get the same amount of data;
2) At fixed budget, there is a trade-off between number of tasks and number of

shown that human visual skills also transfer better from easy tasks. We prove

partially circumvented by total or partial removal of the silica under-cladding
to form Si membranes or pedestal waveguides. However, this approach complicates

new strategy to confine photons and phonons in SOI without removing the silica

micro-resonators yielding remarkable optomechanical coupling (go=49 kHz)
between 0.66 GHz mechanical modes and near-infrared optical modes. The
mechanical mode exhibits a measured quality factor of Qm = 730, the largest
reported for SOI optomechanical resonators, without silica removal. This value
compares favorably with state-of-the-art Si membrane waveguides recently used
to demonstrate remarkable Brillouin interactions in silicon (Qm ~ 700). These
results open a new path for developing optomechanics in SOI without the need

remarkable progress using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). For structured input
synthesis and structured output prediction problems (e.g., layout-to-image
synthesis and image semantic segmentation respectively), they often are studied
separately. This paper proposes deep consensus learning (DCL) for joint
layout-to-image synthesis and weakly-supervised image semantic segmentation.
The former is realized by a recently proposed LostGAN approach, and the latter
by introducing an inference network as the third player joining the two-player
game of LostGAN. Two deep consensus mappings are exploited to facilitate
training the three networks end-to-end: Given an input layout (a list of object
bounding boxes), the generator generates a mask (label map) and then use it to
help synthesize an image. The inference network infers the mask for the
synthesized image. Then, the latent consensus is measured between the mask
generated by the generator and the one inferred by the inference network. For
the real image corresponding to the input layout, its mask also is computed by
the inference network, and then used by the generator to reconstruct the real
image. Then, the data consensus is measured between the real image and its
reconstructed image. The discriminator still plays the role of an adversary by
computing the realness scores for a real image, its reconstructed image and a
synthesized image. In experiments, our DCL is tested in the COCO-Stuff dataset.
It obtains compelling layout-to-image synthesis results and weakly-supervised
image semantic segmentation results.

and static expanded envelopes of neutron stars caused by high luminosities in
type I X-ray bursts. We use flux-limited diffusion to model the transition from
optically thick to optically thin, and include effects of general relativity,
allowing us to study the photospheric radius close to the star as the
hydrostatic atmosphere evolves into a wind. We find that the photospheric
radius evolves monotonically from static envelopes ($r_{\rm ph}\lesssim 50-70$
km) to winds ($r_{\rm ph}\approx 100-1000$ km). Photospheric radii of less than
$100$ km, as observed in most photospheric radius expansion bursts, can be
explained by static envelopes, but only in a narrow range of luminosity. In
most bursts, we would expect the luminosity to increase further, leading to a
wind with photospheric radius $\gtrsim 100$ km. In the contraction phase, the
expanded envelope solutions show that the photosphere is still $\approx 1$ km
above the surface when the effective temperature is only $3\%$ away from its
maximum value. This is a possible systematic uncertainty when interpreting the
measured Eddington fluxes from bursts at touchdown. We also discuss the
applicability of steady-state models to describe the dynamics of bursts. In
particular, we show that the sub to super-Eddington transition during the burst
rise is rapid enough that static models are not appropriate. Finally, we
analyze the strength of spectral shifts in our models. Expected shifts at the
photosphere are dominated by gravitational redshift, and are therefore
predicted to be less than a few percent.

continuous-time piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) suitable for

prior knowledge that many coordinates are likely to be exactly $0$. This is
achieved with the fairly simple idea of endowing existing PDMP samplers with
'sticky' coordinate axes, coordinate planes etc. Upon hitting those subspaces,
an event is triggered during which the process sticks to the subspace, this way
spending some time in a sub-model. This results in non-reversible jumps between
different (sub-)models. While we show that PDMP samplers in general can be made
sticky, we mainly focus on the Zig-Zag sampler. Compared to the Gibbs sampler
for variable selection, we heuristically derive favourable dependence of the
Sticky Zig-Zag sampler on dimension and data size. The computational efficiency
of the Sticky Zig-Zag sampler is further established through numerical
experiments where both the sample size and the dimension of the parameter space

the Planck 2018 measurements, we could give tight constraints on the evolution
of $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ from about $10^4$ FRBs with the intrinsic DM scatter of
$30(1+z)~ \rm pc/cm^3$ spanning 80% of the sky and redshift range $z=0-3$.
Firstly, we consider the Taylor expansion of $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ up to second

recent years, a promising variation called extreme mutation testing emerged
that is computationally less expensive. It identifies methods where their
functionality can be entirely removed, and the test suite would not notice it,
despite having coverage. These methods are called pseudo-tested. In this paper,
we compare the execution and analysis times for traditional and extreme
mutation testing and discuss what they mean in practice. We look at how extreme
mutation testing impacts current software development practices and discuss
open challenges that need to be addressed to foster industry adoption. For
that, we conducted an industrial case study consisting of running traditional
and extreme mutation testing in a large software project from the semiconductor
industry that is covered by a test suite of more than 11,000 unit tests. In
addition to that, we did a qualitative analysis of 25 pseudo-tested methods and
interviewed two experienced developers to see how they write unit tests and
gathered opinions on how useful the findings of extreme mutation testing are.
Our results include execution times, scores, numbers of executed tests and
mutators, reasons why methods are pseudo-tested, and an interview summary. We
conclude that the shorter execution and analysis times are well noticeable in
practice and show that extreme mutation testing supplements writing unit tests
in conjunction with code coverage tools. We propose that pseudo-tested code
should be highlighted in code coverage reports and that extreme mutation
testing should be performed when writing unit tests rather than in a decoupled
session. Future research should investigate how to perform extreme mutation
testing while writing unit tests such that the results are available fast
enough but still meaningful.

maximize the information gathering from the collected data. The optimal design
is usually achieved by maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the data

unavailable, e.g., having implicit models with intractable data distributions,
a neural network-based lower bound of the MI was recently proposed and a
gradient ascent method was used to maximize the lower bound. However, the
approach in Kleinegesse et al., 2020 requires a pathwise sampling path to
compute the gradient of the MI lower bound with respect to the design
variables, and such a pathwise sampling path is usually inaccessible for
implicit models. In this work, we propose a hybrid gradient approach that
leverages recent advances in variational MI estimator and evolution strategies
(ES) combined with black-box stochastic gradient ascent (SGA) to maximize the
MI lower bound. This allows the design process to be achieved through a unified
scalable procedure for implicit models without sampling path gradients. Several
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the

There is a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for the USSP problem with

Therefore, this solution is impractical for the large-scale problems.
  In this paper, first we propose an efficient polynomial-time algorithm with
$O(n)$ computational complexity for solving the specific case of the USSP where
$ s> \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}q_iq_{i+1}-q_i-q_{i+1}$, $q_i$'s are the elements of a

$O(n^2)$ computational complexity that finds the answer for some inputs with a
probability between $0.5$ to $1$. Its success probability is directly related
to the number of subsets of $W$ in which $gcd$ of their elements divides $s$.
This algorithm can solve the USSP problem with large inputs in the
polynomial-time, no matter how big inputs are, but, in some special cases where
$s$ is small, it cannot find the answer.

further loss of life, the rate of disease spread is very high. For this reason,
the help of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and artificial intelligence (AI)
algorithms is vital. In this study, a method based on optimization of
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is the most effective
image analysis method of today, is proposed to fulfill the mentioned COVID-19
detection needs. First, COVID-19 images are trained using ResNet-50 and VGG-16
architectures. Then, features in the last layer of these two architectures are
combined with feature fusion. These new image features matrices obtained with
feature fusion are classified for COVID detection. A multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) structure optimized by the whale optimization algorithm is used for the
classification process. The obtained results show that the performance of the
proposed framework is almost 4.5% higher than VGG-16 performance and almost
3.5% higher than ResNet-50 performance.

(TSER). In the literature, some well-known time series classifiers have been
extended for TSER problems. As first benchmarking studies have focused on
predictive performance, very little attention has been given to
interpretability. To fill this gap, in this paper, we suggest an extension of a
Bayesian method for robust and interpretable feature construction and selection
in the context of TSER. Our approach exploits a relational way to tackle with
TSER: (i), we build various and simple representations of the time series which
are stored in a relational data scheme, then, (ii), a propositionalisation
technique (based on classical aggregation / selection functions from the
relational data field) is applied to build interpretable features from
secondary tables to ""flatten"" the data; and (iii), the constructed features are
filtered out through a Bayesian Maximum A Posteriori approach. The resulting
transformed data can be processed with various existing regressors.
Experimental validation on various benchmark data sets demonstrates the
benefits of the suggested approach.

several possible methods on reducing the number of high risk wildfires. Taken
together, our study has the potential to estimate, monitor, and reduce the

analytical landslide velocity model that incorporates internal deformation and
external forces: net driving force and viscous resistant. The model stands as a
novel non-linear advective-dissipative system where classical Voellmy and
inviscid Burgers' equation are specifications. Non-linear advection and
external forcing fundamentally regulate the motion which substantially enhances
our understanding of a coherently deforming landslide. Since analytical
solutions provide fastest, cost-effective and best rigorous answer to the
problem, we construct several new/general exact analytical solutions covering
wider spectrum of landslide velocity. New solutions bridge existing gap between
negligibly and massively deforming landslides. This provides a novel, rapid and
consistent method for efficient coupling of different types of mass transports.
Mechanism of landslide advection, stretching and approaching to steady-state
has been explained. Shifting, up-lifting and stretching of velocity field stem
from forcing and advection. Our solution describes fascinating breaking wave
and emergence of landslide folding. This happens as the solution simultaneously
introduces domain propagation, velocity up-lift and non-linear advection.
Domain translation and stretching depends on net driving force and viscous drag
controls shock wave generation, wave breaking, folding and velocity. Landslide
dynamics are architectured by advection and reigned by system forcing.
Analytically obtained velocities are close to observed values, constituting a
new foundation of landslide velocity. This provides the practitioners with key

chain is the Viterbi path -- the path maximising the posterior probability. We
consider a more general setting, called the pairwise Markov model (PMM), where
the joint process consisting of finite-state hidden process and observation
process is assumed to be a Markov chain. It has been recently proven that under
some conditions the Viterbi path of the PMM can almost surely be extended to
infinity, thereby defining the infinite Viterbi decoding of the observation
sequence, called the Viterbi process. This was done by constructing a block of
observations, called a barrier, which ensures that the Viterbi path goes trough
a given state whenever this block occurs in the observation sequence. In this
paper we prove that the joint process consisting of Viterbi process and PMM is
regenerative. The proof involves a delicate construction of regeneration times
which coincide with the occurrences of barriers. As one possible application of
our theory, some results on the asymptotics of the Viterbi training algorithm
are derived.

that all Collatz sequences will eventually reach a value of one), but has
stubbornly resisted a proof. Many professional mathematicians have applied an
impressive array of machinery to its analysis, and discovered some limits or
boundaries to where violations of the Collatz conjecture must be, if they
exist. Here we attempt to look at the conjecture differently than most
mathematicians or number theorists, i.e. we will study the conjecture from the
points of view of a statistician/data scientist and of an engineer. As a
statistician or data scientist, we look at Collatz sequences as if they were
sequences found in nature, like a collection of time series produced by some
natural process, ignoring for the time being their completely deterministic
origins. As an engineer, we try to tinker with Collatz sequences to see what
makes them tick, and engineer -- tweak and build -- changes to the sequences
that likewise do interesting things, after first specifying exactly what we
mean by interesting. Although these analyses do not yield a proof of the
Collatz conjecture, like other efforts they present reasons to think that the
conjecture is probably true, and the hope is that the analyses of sequences
similar to Collatz sequences will tell us something about the nature of Collatz
conjecture itself, and/or lead us into interesting and fruitful new directions.
Indeed, many of the phenomenon revealed in the sequences of these Collatz-like
programs are arguably more interesting than, and suggest conjectures that are
as interesting as, the Collatz conjecture itself.

lengths of the country-dependent time segments are defined by breaks in the GDP
measurement units associated with definitional revisions to the nominal GDP and

first droplet in a charged-particle track; subsequent droplets are explained by
Mott's 1929 wave-theoretic argument about collision-induced wavefunction
collimation. I formulate a mechanism for how the first droplet in a cloud
chamber track arises, making no reference to quantum measurement axioms. I look
specifically at tracks of charged particles emitted in the simplest slow
decays, because I can reason about rather than guess the form that wave packets
take. The first visible droplet occurs when a randomly occurring,
barely-subcritical vapor droplet is pushed past criticality by ionization
triggered by the faint wavefunction of the emitted charged particle. This is
possible because potential energy incurred when an ionized vapor molecule
polarizes the other molecules in a droplet can balance the excitation energy
needed for the emitted charged particle to create the ion in the first place.
This degeneracy is a singular condition for Coulombic scattering, leading to
infinite or near-infinite ionization cross sections, and from there to an
emergent Born rule in position space, but not an operator projection as in the
projection postulate. Analogous mechanisms may explain canonical quantum
measurement behavior in detectors such as ionization chambers, proportional
counters, photomultiplier tubes or bubble chambers. This work is important
because attempts to understand canonical quantum measurement behavior and its
limitations have become urgent in view of worldwide investment in quantum
