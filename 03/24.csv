through online labour platforms such as Upwork and Amazon Mechanical Turk. We
combine data collected from various sources to build a data-driven assessment
of the number of such online workers (also known as online freelancers)
globally. Our headline estimate is that there are 163 million freelancer
profiles registered on online labour platforms globally. Approximately 19
million of them have obtained work through the platform at least once, and 5
million have completed at least 10 projects or earned at least $1000. These
numbers suggest a substantial growth from 2015 in registered worker accounts,
but much less growth in amount of work completed by workers. Our results
indicate that online freelancing represents a non-trivial segment of labour
today, but one that is spread thinly across countries and sectors.

how biological systems self-organize and survive in their environment. This
principle provides insights on multiple scales, from high-level behavioral and
cognitive functions such as attention or foraging, down to the dynamics of
specialized cortical microcircuits, suggesting that the FEP manifests on
several levels of brain function. Here, we apply the FEP to one of the smallest
functional units of the brain: single excitatory synaptic connections. By
focusing on an experimentally well understood biological system we are able to
derive learning rules from first principles while keeping assumptions minimal.
This synapse-centric account of the FEP predicts that synapses interact with
the soma of the post-synaptic neuron through stochastic synaptic releases to
probe their behavior and use back-propagating action potentials as feedback to
update the synaptic weights. The emergent learning rules are regulated triplet
STDP rules that depend only on the timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes
and the internal states of the synapse. The parameters of the learning rules
are fully determined by the parameters of the post-synaptic neuron model,
suggesting a close interplay between the synaptic and somatic compartment and
making precise predictions about the synaptic dynamics. The synapse-level
uncertainties automatically lead to representations of uncertainty on the
network level that manifest in ambiguous situations. We show that the FEP
learning rules can be applied to spiking neural networks for supervised and
unsupervised learning and for a closed loop learning task where a behaving
agent interacts with an environment.

  Grade estimation of prostate cancer in multiparametric Magnetic Resonance
  Images",,,,,"physics.med-ph cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The emergence of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has had
a profound impact on the diagnosis of prostate cancers (PCa), which is the most
prevalent malignancy in males in the western world, enabling a better selection
of patients for confirmation biopsy. However, analyzing these images is complex
even for experts, hence opening an opportunity for computer-aided diagnosis
systems to seize. This paper proposes a fully automatic system based on Deep
Learning that takes a prostate mpMRI from a PCa-suspect patient and, by
leveraging the Retina U-Net detection framework, locates PCa lesions, segments
them, and predicts their most likely Gleason grade group (GGG). It uses 490
mpMRIs for training/validation, and 75 patients for testing from two different
datasets: ProstateX and IVO (Valencia Oncology Institute Foundation). In the
test set, it achieves an excellent lesion-level AUC/sensitivity/specificity for
the GGG$\geq$2 significance criterion of 0.96/1.00/0.79 for the ProstateX
dataset, and 0.95/1.00/0.80 for the IVO dataset. Evaluated at a patient level,
the results are 0.87/1.00/0.375 in ProstateX, and 0.91/1.00/0.762 in IVO.
Furthermore, on the online ProstateX grand challenge, the model obtained an AUC
of 0.85 (0.87 when trained only on the ProstateX data, tying up with the
original winner of the challenge). For expert comparison, IVO radiologist's
PI-RADS 4 sensitivity/specificity were 0.88/0.56 at a lesion level, and
0.85/0.58 at a patient level. Additional subsystems for automatic prostate
zonal segmentation and mpMRI non-rigid sequence registration were also employed
to produce the final fully automated system. The code for the ProstateX-trained
system has been made openly available at
https://github.com/OscarPellicer/prostate_lesion_detection. We hope that this
will represent a landmark for future research to use, compare and improve upon.

of 10\,GPa and temperatures of about 2000\,K. Here, we provide evidence that
the pressure exerted by the tip of an atomic force microscope onto graphene
over the carbon buffer layer of silicon carbide can lead to a temporary
transition of graphite to diamond on the atomic scale. We perform atomic force
microscopy with CO terminated tips and copper oxide (CuOx) tips to image
graphene and to induce the structural transition. For a local transition, DFT
predicts that a repulsive barrier of $\approx13$\,nN, followed by a force
reduction by $\approx4$\,nN is overcome when inducing the graphite-diamond
transition. Experimental evidence for this transition is provided by the
observation of third harmonics in the cantilever oscillation for relative
flexible CO terminated tips and a kink in the force versus distance curve for
rigid CuOx tips. The experimental observation of the third harmonic with a
magnitude of about 200\,fm fits to a force with an amplitude of $\pm 3$\,nN.
The large repulsive overall force of $\approx 10$\,nN is only compatible with
the experiment if one assumes that the repulsive force acting on the tip when
inducing the transition is compensated by an increased van-der-Waals attraction
of the tip due to form fitting of tip and sample by local indentation. The
transition changes flat sp$^2$ bonds to corrugated sp$^3$ bonds, resulting in a
different height of the two basis atoms in the elementary cell of graphene.
Both tip types show a strong asysmmetry between the two basis atoms of the
lattice when using large repulsive tip forces that induce the transition.
Experimental data of tunneling current, frequency shift and dissipation are
consistent with the proposed transition. The experiment also shows that atomic
force microscopy allows to perform high pressure physics on the atomic scale.

and track the stochastic dynamical variables of a state-space system. The
proposed method is based on the nested hybrid filtering (NHF) framework of [1],
that combines two layers of filters, one inside the other, to compute the joint
posterior probability distribution of the static parameters and the state
variables. In particular, we explore the use of deterministic sampling
techniques for Gaussian approximation in the first layer of the algorithm,
instead of the Monte Carlo methods employed in the original procedure. The
resulting scheme reduces the computational cost and so makes the algorithms
potentially better-suited for high-dimensional state and parameter spaces. We
describe a specific instance of the new method and then study its performance
and efficiency of the resulting algorithms for a stochastic Lorenz 63 model

dimensions for theories with theta and Maxwell terms. Our construction mirrors
the recipe used in (2+1)-dimensions to demonstrate a similar duality for

consists of boson-boson, fermion-fermion and boson-fermion dualities, any one

by constructing the basic bosonization duality which we then use to generate
the web, using an analog of the 3-dimensional massive construction given in
\cite{Nastase:2017gxr} . The resulting 4-dimensional duality web is best
understood as an extension of the, by now well-known, 3-dimensional case due to
its somewhat singular nature. We conjecture that this is the final thread in a
multi-dimensional duality web that connects low energy theories in 4-, 3- and

we validated the performance of trained models using datasets with other flaky

for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. Using one of the state-of-the-art NF

that this model under performs in conform related research. To improve the OOD

utilize Wavelet Flow which uses wavelets that can filter particular frequency

wavelet coefficients instead of complete images. This enables us to efficiently
model larger resolution images in the hopes that it would capture more relevant
features for OOD. The paper that introduced Wavelet Flow mainly focuses on its
ability of sampling high resolution images and did not treat OOD detection. We

state-of-the-art self-supervised methods based on instance discrimination and

clearly establishes the feasibility of extracting discriminative

exploration of quantum many-body phenomena arising from long-range
interactions. A series of recent experiments has demonstrated the formation of
supersolid states of matter. Subsequent theoretical works have shown that
quantum fluctuations can affect the underlying phase transition and may lead to
the emergence of supersolids with various lattice structures in dipolar
condensates. In this work we explore the signatures of such different
geometries in confined finite condensates. In addition to previously found
triangular lattices, our analysis reveals a rich spectrum of states, from
honeycomb patterns and ring structures to striped supersolids. By optimizing
relevant parameters we show that transitions between distinct supersolids
should be observable in current experiments.

  insulators",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Robustness against disorder and defects is a pivotal advantage of topological
systems, manifested by absence of electronic backscattering in the quantum Hall
and spin-Hall effects, and unidirectional waveguiding in their classical
analogs. Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators, in particular, provide
unprecedented opportunities in a variety of fields due to their compact planar
geometries compatible with the fabrication technologies used in modern
electronics and photonics. Among all 2D topological phases, Chern insulators
are to date the most reliable designs due to the genuine backscattering
immunity of their non-reciprocal edge modes, brought via time-reversal symmetry
breaking. Yet, such resistance to fabrication tolerances is limited to
fluctuations of the same order of magnitude as their band gap, limiting their
resilience to small perturbations only. Here, we tackle this vexing problem by
introducing the concept of anomalous non-reciprocal topological networks, that
survive disorder levels with strengths arbitrarily larger than their bandgap.
We explore the general conditions to obtain such unusual effect in systems made
of unitary three-port scattering matrices connected by phase links, and
establish the superior robustness of the anomalous edge modes over the Chern
ones to phase link disorder of arbitrarily large values. We confirm
experimentally the exceptional resilience of the anomalous phase, and
demonstrate its operation by building an ideal anomalous topological circulator
despite its arbitrary shape and large number of ports. Our results pave the way
to efficient, arbitrary planar energy transport on 2D substrates for wave
devices with full protection against large fabrication flaws or imperfections.

  Suboptimality Gap",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A fundamental question in the theory of reinforcement learning is: suppose
the optimal $Q$-function lies in the linear span of a given $d$ dimensional
feature mapping, is sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) possible? The
recent and remarkable result of Weisz et al. (2020) resolved this question in
the negative, providing an exponential (in $d$) sample size lower bound, which
holds even if the agent has access to a generative model of the environment.
One may hope that this information theoretic barrier for RL can be circumvented
by further supposing an even more favorable assumption: there exists a
\emph{constant suboptimality gap} between the optimal $Q$-value of the best
action and that of the second-best action (for all states). The hope is that
having a large suboptimality gap would permit easier identification of optimal
actions themselves, thus making the problem tractable; indeed, provided the
agent has access to a generative model, sample-efficient RL is in fact possible
with the addition of this more favorable assumption.
  This work focuses on this question in the standard online reinforcement
learning setting, where our main result resolves this question in the negative:
our hardness result shows that an exponential sample complexity lower bound
still holds even if a constant suboptimality gap is assumed in addition to
having a linearly realizable optimal $Q$-function. Perhaps surprisingly, this
implies an exponential separation between the online RL setting and the
generative model setting. Complementing our negative hardness result, we give
two positive results showing that provably sample-efficient RL is possible
either under an additional low-variance assumption or under a novel
hypercontractivity assumption (both implicitly place stronger conditions on the
underlying dynamics model).

central in preventing overfitting; empirically, we often see a benign
overfitting phenomenon in overparameterized settings for natural learning
algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), where little to no
explicit regularization has been employed. This work considers this issue in
arguably the most basic setting: constant-stepsize SGD (with iterate averaging
or tail averaging) for linear regression in the overparameterized regime. Our
main result provides a sharp excess risk bound, stated in terms of the full
eigenspectrum of the data covariance matrix, that reveals a bias-variance
decomposition characterizing when generalization is possible: (i) the variance
bound is characterized in terms of an effective dimension (specific for SGD)
and (ii) the bias bound provides a sharp geometric characterization in terms of
the location of the initial iterate (and how it aligns with the data covariance
matrix). More specifically, for SGD with iterate averaging, we demonstrate the
sharpness of the established excess risk bound by proving a matching lower
bound (up to constant factors). For SGD with tail averaging, we show its
advantage over SGD with iterate averaging by proving a better excess risk bound
together with a nearly matching lower bound. Moreover, we reflect on a number
of notable differences between the algorithmic regularization afforded by
(unregularized) SGD in comparison to ordinary least squares (minimum-norm
interpolation) and ridge regression. Experimental results on synthetic data
corroborate our theoretical findings.

function of redshift. In this work, we look for a time evolution of $\gamma(z)$
at $R_{500}$ by using both the SPT-SZ and Planck Early SZ (ESZ) cluster data,
in a model-independent fashion without any explicit dependence on the
underlying cosmology. For this calculation, we use a non-parametric functional

cosmic chronometers. We parameterize $\gamma(z)$ as: $\gamma(z)=
\gamma_0(1+\gamma_1 z)$ to constrain the redshift evolution. We find
contradictory results between both the samples. For SPT-SZ, $\gamma (z)$
decreases as a function of redshift (at more than 5$\sigma$), whereas a
positive trend with redshift is found for Planck ESZ data (at more than
4$\sigma$). We however find that the $\gamma_1$ values for a subset of SPT-SZ
and Planck ESZ clusters between the same redshift interval agree to within
$1\sigma$. When we allow for a dependence on the halo mass in the evolution of
the gas depletion factor, the $4-5\sigma$ discrepancy reduces to $2\sigma$.

example, the maximum mass for non-rotating white dwarfs is given by the famous
Chandrasekhar limit about $1.4 M_\odot$ (solar masses). Although the mass limit
for neutron stars is not so clear to date, one of the widely accepted values is
about $2.1 M_\odot\,$. Recently, challenges to these mass limits appeared.
Motivated by the super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs with masses up to $2.4
\sim 2.8 M_\odot\,$, and compact objects (probably neutron stars) in the mass
gap (from $2.5 M_\odot$ or $3 M_\odot$ to $5 M_\odot$) inferred from
gravitational waves detected by LIGO/Virgo in the third observing run (O3), we
reconsider the mass limits for compact stars in the present work. Without
invoking strong magnetic field and/or exotic equation of state (EOS), we try to
increase the mass limits for compact stars in modified gravity theory. In this
work, we propose an inverse chameleon mechanism, and show that the fifth-force
mediated by the scalar field can evade the severe tests on earth, in solar
system and universe, but manifest itself in compact stars such as white dwarfs
and neutron stars. The mass limits for compact stars in the inverse chameleon
mechanism can be easily increased to $3 M_\odot\,$, $5 M_\odot$ or even larger.
We argue that the inverse chameleon mechanism might be constrained by the
observations of exoplanets orbiting compact stars (such as white dwarfs and
neutron stars), and gravitational waves from the last stage of binary compact
star coalescence.

interplay between the interfacial spin accumulation in Pt originating from the
spin Nernst effect and the orientation of the N\'eel vector of
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, rather than its net magnetization. Since the latter is
negligible in an antiferromagnet, our device is superior to ferromagnetic
structures, allowing to unambiguously distinguish the TSNM from thermally
excited magnon transport (TMT), which usually dominates in ferri/ferromagnets
due to their non-zero magnetization. Evaluating the temperature dependence of
the effect, we observe a vanishing TSNM below ~100 K. We compare these results
with theoretical calculations of the temperature dependent spin Nernst
conductivity and find excellent agreement. This provides evidence for a
vanishing spin Nernst angle of Pt at low temperatures and the dominance of
extrinsic contributions to the spin Nernst effect.

simultaneously with a disappearance of the 3d spins order what is the evidence
of a strong coupling between magnetism of Eu2+ ions and the conduction
electrons of [Fe(2-x)Ni(x)As2]2- layers. The Fe nuclei experience the
transferred hyperfine magnetic field due to the Eu2+ ordering for
Ni-substituted samples with x > 0.04, while the transferred field is

cosmological history around the electroweak scale. We show that besides the
possibility of strong first-order phase transitions, which have been thoroughly
studied in the literature, also other important phenomena can occur, like the
non-restoration of the electroweak symmetry or the existence of vacua in which
the Universe becomes trapped, preventing a transition to the electroweak
minimum. Focusing on the next-to-minimal two-Higgs-doublet model (N2HDM) of
type II and taking into account the existing theoretical and experimental
constraints, we identify the scenarios of electroweak symmetry non-restoration,
vacuum trapping and first-order phase transition in the thermal history of the
Universe. We analyze these phenomena and in particular their relation to each
other, and discuss their connection to the predicted phenomenology of the N2HDM
at the LHC. Our analysis demonstrates that the presence of a global electroweak
minimum of the scalar potential at zero temperature does not guarantee that the
corresponding N2HDM parameter space will be physically viable: the existence of
a critical temperature at which the electroweak phase becomes the deepest
minimum is not sufficient for a transition to take place, necessitating an
analysis of the tunnelling probability to the electroweak minimum for a
reliable prediction of the thermal history of the Universe.

problem motivated by numerous applications in Machine Learning. Focusing on

the extension of univariate quantiles to multivariate spaces. Data depth is a
nonparametric statistical tool that measures the centrality of any element

quantiles. The new pseudo-metric relies on the average of the Hausdorff
distance between the depth-based quantile regions w.r.t. each distribution. Its
good behavior w.r.t. major transformation groups, as well as its ability to

$R_0$, the quoted relation allows the determination of the mass of the object
studied. The relationships for the case in which also the angular momentum is
taken into account gives a mass $\simeq 90$ \% larger than the standard
Lemaitre-Tolman model, and two times the value of the standard Lemaitre-Tolman
model, in the case also dynamical friction is taken into account. As a second
step, we found relationships between the velocity, $v$, and radius, $R$, and
fitted them to data of the Local Group, M81, NGC 253, IC342, CenA/M83, and to
the Virgo clusters obtained by Ref.[New Astronomy 11(4):325, A&A 488(3):845].
This allowed us to find optimized values of the mass and Hubble constant of the
objects studied. The fit gives values of the masses smaller with respect to the
$M-R_0$ relationship method, but in any case 30-40\% larger than the $v-R$
relationship obtained from the standard Lemaitre-Tolman model. Differently from
mass, the Hubble parameter becomes smaller with respect to the standard
Lemaitre-Tolman model, when angular momentum, and dynamical friction are
introduced. This is in agreement with Ref.[New Astronomy 11(4):325, A&A
488(3):845], who improved the standard Lemaitre-Tolman model taking into
account the cosmological constant.
  Finally, we used the mass, $M$, and $R_0$ of the studied objects to put
constraints to the dark energy equation of state parameter, $w$. Comparison
with previous studies show different constraints on $w$.

addresses this problem by investigating a class of simple, yet highly effective

agent from a distributed parameter system (DPS) that takes values in the
scalar-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space $H_X$ of functions over $X$.
Approximations of the evolution of the ideal local estimate $\hat{g}^i_t$ of
agent $i$ is constructed solely using observations made by agent $i$ on a fine
time scale. Since the local estimates on the fine time scale are constructed
independently for each agent, we say that the method is strictly decentralized.
On a coarse time scale, the individual local estimates $\hat{g}^i_t$ are fused
via the expression $\hat{g}_t:=\sum_{i=1}^N\Psi^i \hat{g}^i_t$ that uses a
partition of unity $\{\Psi^i\}_{1\leq i\leq N}$ subordinate to the cover
$\{\Omega^i\}_{i=1,\ldots,N}$ of $\Omega$. Realizable algorithms are obtained
by constructing finite dimensional approximations of the DPS in terms of
scattered bases defined by each agent from samples along their trajectories.
Rates of convergence of the error in the finite dimensional approximations are
derived in terms of the fill distance of the samples that define the scattered
centers in each subdomain. The qualitative performance of the convergence rates
for the decentralized estimation method is illustrated via numerical
simulations.

sparse sketch lines and color dots, convey user intentions for content creation
(\ie, free-form editing). While existing methods combine an input image and
these low-level controls for CNN inputs, the corresponding feature
representations are not sufficient to convey user intentions, leading to
unfaithfully generated content. In this paper, we propose DeFLOCNet which
relies on a deep encoder-decoder CNN to retain the guidance of these controls
in the deep feature representations. In each skip-connection layer, we design a
structure generation block. Instead of attaching low-level controls to an input
image, we inject these controls directly into each structure generation block
for sketch line refinement and color propagation in the CNN feature space. We
then concatenate the modulated features with the original decoder features for
structure generation. Meanwhile, DeFLOCNet involves another decoder branch for
texture generation and detail enhancement. Both structures and textures are
rendered in the decoder, leading to user-intended editing results. Experiments
on benchmarks demonstrate that DeFLOCNet effectively transforms different user
intentions to create visually pleasing content.

$V_1$ or triplet $V_3$ representations in the ${\cal{O}}(1-10)$ TeV range. We
explore the sensitivity of the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and future
proton-proton colliders to $V_1$ and $V_3$ in the parameter space connected to
$R_{K,K^*}$-data. We consider pair production and single production in
association with muons in different flavor benchmarks. Reinterpreting a recent
ATLAS search for scalar leptoquarks decaying to $b \mu$ and $j \mu$, we extract
improved limits for the leptoquark masses: For gauge boson-type leptoquarks
($\kappa=1$) we obtain $M_{V_1}> 1.9$ TeV, $M_{V_1}> 1.9$ TeV, and $M_{V_1}>
1.7$ TeV for leptoquarks decaying predominantly according to hierarchical,
flipped and democratic quark flavor structure, respectively. Future sensitivity
projections based on extrapolations of existing ATLAS and CMS searches are
worked out. We find that for $\kappa=1$ the mass reach for pair (single)
production of $V_1$ can be up to 3 TeV (2.1 TeV) at the HL-LHC and up to 15 TeV
(19.9 TeV) at the FCC-hh with $\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV and $20 \, \mbox{ab}^{-1}$.
The mass limits and reach for the triplet $V_3$ are similar or higher,
depending on flavor. While there is the exciting possibility that leptoquarks
addressing the $R_{K,K^*}$-anomalies are observed at the LHC, to fully cover
the parameter space $pp$-collisions beyond the LHC-energies are needed.

  Logistic Regression",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Logistic regression remains one of the most widely used tools in applied
statistics, machine learning and data science. However, in moderately
high-dimensional problems, where the number of features $d$ is a non-negligible
fraction of the sample size $n$, the logistic regression maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE), and statistical procedures based the large-sample
approximation of its distribution, behave poorly. Recently, Sur and Cand\`es
(2019) showed that these issues can be corrected by applying a new
approximation of the MLE's sampling distribution in this high-dimensional
regime. Unfortunately, these corrections are difficult to implement in
practice, because they require an estimate of the \emph{signal strength}, which
is a function of the underlying parameters $\beta$ of the logistic regression.
To address this issue, we propose SLOE, a fast and straightforward approach to
estimate the signal strength in logistic regression. The key insight of SLOE is
that the Sur and Cand\`es (2019) correction can be reparameterized in terms of
the \emph{corrupted signal strength}, which is only a function of the estimated
parameters $\widehat \beta$. We propose an estimator for this quantity, prove
that it is consistent in the relevant high-dimensional regime, and show that
dimensionality correction using SLOE is accurate in finite samples. Compared to
the existing ProbeFrontier heuristic, SLOE is conceptually simpler and orders
of magnitude faster, making it suitable for routine use. We demonstrate the
importance of routine dimensionality correction in the Heart Disease dataset
from the UCI repository, and a genomics application using data from the UK
Biobank. We provide an open source package for this method, available at

temporal modes is used to obtain stable and accurate reduced order models
(ROMs) of unsteady compressible flows. Model reduction is obtained via Galerkin
and Petrov-Galerkin projection of the non-conservative compressible
Navier-Stokes equations. The latter approach is implemented using the
least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) technique and the present methodology
allows pre-computation of both Galerkin and LSPG coefficients. Closure is
performed by adding linear and non-linear coefficients to the original ROMs and
minimizing the error with respect to the POD temporal modes. In order to
further reduce the computational cost of the ROMs, an accelerated greedy
missing point estimation (MPE) hyper-reduction method is employed. A canonical
compressible cylinder flow is first analyzed and serves as a benchmark. The
second problem studied consists of the turbulent flow over a plunging airfoil
undergoing deep dynamic stall. For the first case, linear and non-linear
closure coefficients are both low in intrusiveness, capable of providing
results in excellent agreement with the full order model. Regularization of
calibrated models is also straightforward for this case. On the other hand, the
dynamic stall flow is significantly more challenging, specially when only
linear coefficients are used. Results show that non-linear calibration
coefficients outperform their linear counterparts when a POD basis with fewer
modes is used in the reconstruction. However, determining a correct level of
regularization is more complicated with non-linear coefficients. Hyper-reduced
models show good results when combined with non-linear calibration and an
appropriate sized POD basis.

preliminary transfer learning experiments, we find that HaloNet models
outperform much larger models and have better inference performance. On harder

baselines. These results mark another step in demonstrating the efficacy of
self-attention models on settings traditionally dominated by convolutional

and vaccines against COVID-19 use the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein as the main
target [1-3]. The binding of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor (ACE2) of
the host cell constitutes the first and key step for virus entry. During this
process, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein plays an essential
role, since it contains the receptor binding motif (RBM), responsible for the
docking to the receptor. So far, mostly biochemical methods are being tested in
order to prevent binding of the virus to ACE2 [4]. Here we show, with the help
of atomistic simulations, that external electric fields of easily achievable
and moderate strengths can dramatically destabilise the S protein, inducing
long-lasting structural damage. One striking field-induced conformational
change occurs at the level of the recognition loop L3 of the RBD where two
parallel beta sheets, believed to be responsible for a high affinity to ACE2
[5], undergo a change into an unstructured coil, which exhibits almost no
binding possibilities to the ACE2 receptor (Figure 1a). Remarkably, while the
structural flexibility of S allows the virus to improve its probability of
entering the cell, it is also the origin of the surprising vulnerability of S
upon application of electric fields of strengths at least two orders of
magnitude smaller than those required for damaging most proteins. Our findings
suggest the existence of a clean physical method to weaken the SARS-CoV-2 virus
without further biochemical processing. Moreover, the effect could be used for
infection prevention purposes and also to develop technologies for in-vitro
structural manipulation of S. Since the method is largely unspecific, it can be
suitable for application to mutations in S, to other proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and
in general to membrane proteins of other virus types.

these systems of equations both in the presence and the absence of stochastic

compare two different techniques for solving for the statistics, timestepping
-- which is able to locate only stable solutions of the equations for the
statistics and direct detection of the fixed points. We develop a complete
methodology and symbolic package in Python for deriving the statistical
equations governing the Low-order dynamic systems in cumulant expansions. We
demonstrate that although direct detection of the fixed points is efficient and
accurate for DSS truncated at second order, the addition of higher order terms
leads to the inclusion of many unstable fixed points that may be found by
direct detection of the fixed point by iterative methods. In those cases
timestepping is a more robust protocol for finding meaninful solutions to DSS.

strongly-interacting system is to measure the time-evolution of its full
many-body state. Despite the conceptual simplicity of this approach, it quickly
becomes intractable as the system size grows. An alternate framework is to
think of the many-body dynamics as generating noise, which can be measured by
the decoherence of a probe qubit. Our work centers on the following question:
What can the decoherence dynamics of such a probe tell us about the many-body
system? In particular, we utilize optically addressable probe spins to
experimentally characterize both static and dynamical properties of
strongly-interacting magnetic dipoles. Our experimental platform consists of
two types of spin defects in diamond: nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers
(probe spins) and substitutional nitrogen impurities (many-body system). We
demonstrate that signatures of the many-body system's dimensionality, dynamics,
and disorder are naturally encoded in the functional form of the NV's
decoherence profile. Leveraging these insights, we directly characterize the
two-dimensional nature of a nitrogen delta-doped diamond sample. In addition,
we explore two distinct facets of the many-body dynamics: First, we address a
persistent debate about the microscopic nature of spin dynamics in
strongly-interacting dipolar systems. Second, we demonstrate direct control
over the correlation time of the many-body system. Finally, we demonstrate
polarization exchange between NV and P1 centers, opening the door to quantum

extremely long lifetime of these states, exceeding seconds in cryogenic
microwave cavities that suppress radiative transitions, and gate protocols that
are robust to finite atomic temperature, we project that arrays of hundreds of
circular Rydberg atoms with two-qubit gate errors around $10^{-5}$ can be
realized using current technology. This approach combines several key elements,
including a quantum nondemolition detection technique for circular Rydberg
states, local manipulation using the ponderomotive potential of focused optical
beams, a gate protocol using multiple circular levels to encode qubits, and
robust dynamical decoupling sequences to suppress unwanted interactions and
errors from atomic motion. This represents a significant improvement on the

dust (T~20-40K) is a reliable tracer of star formation even in the presence of
a bright active galactic nucleus (AGN). Based on radiative transfer (RT) models
of clumpy AGN tori, hot dust emission from the torus contributes negligibly to
the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) at $\lambda\ga100$ \micron.
However, these models do not include AGN heating of host-galaxy-scale diffuse
dust, which may have far-IR (FIR) colors comparable to cold diffuse dust heated
by stars. To quantify the contribution of AGN heating to host-galaxy-scale cold
dust emission at $\lambda\ga100$ \micron, we perform dust RT calculations on a
simulated galaxy merger both including and excluding the bright AGN that it
hosts. By differencing the SEDs yielded by RT calculations with and without AGN
that are otherwise identical, we quantify the FIR cold dust emission arising
solely from re-processed AGN photons. In extreme cases, AGN-heated
host-galaxy-scale dust can increase galaxy-integrated FIR flux densities by
factors of 2-4; star formation rates calculated from the FIR luminosity
assuming no AGN contribution can overestimate the true value by comparable
factors. Because the FIR colors of such systems are similar to those of purely
star-forming galaxies and redder than torus models, broadband SED decomposition
may be insufficient for disentangling the contributions of stars and heavily
dust-enshrouded AGN in the most IR-luminous galaxies. We demonstrate how
kpc-scale resolved observations can be used to identify deeply dust-enshrouded
AGN with cool FIR colors when spectroscopic and/or X-ray detection methods are

is based on a sample of about 16,000 well-defined LSP variables detected in the

combined with the mid-infrared data extracted from the NEOWISE-R archive. From
this collection, we selected about 700 objects with stable, large-amplitude,
well-sampled infrared light curves and found that about half of them exhibit
secondary eclipses, thus presenting an important piece of evidence that the
physical mechanism responsible for LSPs is binarity. Namely, the LSP light
changes are due to the presence of a dusty cloud orbiting the red giant
together with the companion and obscuring the star once per orbit. The
secondary eclipses, visible only in the infrared wavelength, occur when the
cloud is hidden behind the giant. In this scenario, the low-mass companion is a
former planet that has accreted a significant amount of mass from the envelope
of its host star and grown into a brown dwarf.

depend on environment. We investigate the luminosity and equivalent width
functions of LAEs in the overdense field of a protocluster at redshift $z
\simeq 3.78$. Using a large sample of LAEs (many spectroscopically confirmed),
we find that the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity distribution is well-represented by a
Schechter (1976) function with $\log(L^{\ast}/{\rm erg s^{-1}}) =
43.26^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ and $\log(\phi^{\ast}/{\rm

width distribution as an exponential, we find a scale factor of
$\omega=79^{+15}_{-15}$ Angstroms. We also measured the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity
and equivalent width functions using the subset of LAEs lying within the
densest cores of the protocluster, finding similar values for $L^*$ and
$\omega$. Hence, despite having a mean overdensity more than 2$\times$ that of
the general field, the shape of the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function and
equivalent width distributions in the protocluster region are comparable to
those measured in the field LAE population by other studies at similar
redshift. While the observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosities and equivalent widths show
correlations with the UV continuum luminosity in this LAE sample, we find that
these are likely due to selection biases and are consistent with no intrinsic
correlations within the sample. This protocluster sample supports the strong
evolutionary trend observed in the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and suggest that
lower redshift LAEs can be on average significantly more dusty that their
counterparts at higher redshift.

that spreads out in radius over time. The inner edge of this feature coincides
with the CO snowline. Almost every model achieves at least CO/H2O of unity, and
one model reaches a CO/H2O ratio > 10. After running our simulations for 1 Myr,
an average of 40% of the disk ice mass contains more CO than H2O ice. In light
of this, a population of CO ice enhanced planetesimals are likely to generally
form in the outer regions of disks, and we speculate that the aforementioned
CO-rich comets may be more common, both in our own Solar System and in
extrasolar systems, than previously expected.

different distributions in the dynamical mass-to-light ratio ($M_{\rm

have been revealing the statistical properties of binary black hole (BBH)
populations. A stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) is a useful tool
to probe the cosmological evolution of those compact mergers. In this paper, we
study the upper bound on a GWB produced by BBH mergers, whose stellar
progenitors dominate the reionization process at the cosmic dawn. Since early
reionization by those progenitors yields a high optical depth of the universe
inconsistent with the {\it Planck} measurements, the cumulative mass density is
limited to $\rho_\star \lesssim 10^7~M_\odot~{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$. Even with this
upper bound, the amplitude of a GWB owing to the high-$z$ BBH mergers is
expected to be as high as $\Omega_{\rm gw}\simeq 1.48_{-1.27}^{+1.80}\times
10^{-9}$ at $f\simeq 25$ Hz, while their merger rate at the present-day is
consistent or lower than the observed GW event rate. This level of GWB is
detectable at the design sensitivity of Advanced LIGO-Virgo and would indicate
a major contribution of the high-$z$ BBH population to the local GW events. The
spectral index is expected to be substantially flatter than the canonical value
of $\simeq 2/3$ generically produced by lower-redshift and less massive BBHs.
Moreover, if their mass function is more top-heavy than in the local universe,

oxide high-temperature superconductors (cuprates) with pair breaking edges host
a flat band of topological zero-energy states, making them an ideal playground
where strong correlations, topology, and disorder are strongly intertwined.
Here we show that this interplay in cuprates generates a new phase of matter: a
fully gapped ``phase crystal"" state that breaks both translational and
time-reversal invariance, characterized by a modulation of the $d$-wave
superconducting phase co-existing with a modulating extended $s$-wave
superconducting order. In contrast to conventional wisdom, we find that this

the presence of strong correlations, thus giving a clear route to its

the realization of practical systems for quantum information processing and
metrology. We use single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to study the
dynamics of a disordered spin ensemble at the diamond surface. Specifically, we
tune the density of ""dark"" surface spins to interrogate their contribution to
the decoherence of shallow NV center spin qubits. When the average surface spin
spacing exceeds the NV center depth, we find that the surface spin contribution
to the NV center free induction decay can be described by a stretched
exponential with variable power n. We show that these observations are
consistent with a model in which the spatial positions of the surface spins are
fixed for each measurement, but some of them reconfigure between measurements.
In particular, we observe a depth-dependent critical time associated with a
dynamical transition from Gaussian (n=2) decay to n=2/3, and show that this
transition arises from the competition between the small decay contributions of
many distant spins and strong coupling to a few proximal spins at the surface.
These observations demonstrate the potential of a local sensor for
understanding complex systems and elucidate pathways for improving and
controlling spin qubits at the surface.

($T_\mathrm{eff}\,\approx\,3500$ K, $M_\star\,\approx\,0.45-0.46\,M_\odot$, and
$R_\star\approx 0.45-0.46\,R_\odot$), and the planets are both
super-Earth-sized ($1.25\,R_\oplus<R_p<2.0\,R_\oplus$). For both systems, light
curves from the ground-based photometry exhibit planetary transits, whose
depths are consistent with those by the TESS photometry. We also refine the
transit ephemerides based on the ground-based photometry, finding the orbital
periods of $P=0.9893436\pm0.0000020$ day and $P=0.6691416\pm0.0000019$ day for
TOI-1634b and TOI-1685b, respectively. Through intensive radial velocity (RV)
observations using IRD on the Subaru 8.2m telescope, we confirm the planetary

$3.43\pm0.93\,M_\oplus$ for TOI-1634b and TOI-1685b, respectively, when the

those with the planet radii of $R_p=1.749\pm 0.079\,R_\oplus$ (TOI-1634b) and
$1.459\pm0.065\,R_\oplus$ (TOI-1685b), we find that both USP planets have mean
densities consistent with an Earth-like internal composition, which is typical
for small USP planets. TOI-1634b is currently the most massive USP planet in
this category, and it resides near the radius valley, which makes it a
benchmark planet in the context of discussing the size limit of rocky planet

lines of Al I, including the commonly-used optical Al I line at 3961 Angstroms.
The Al II line is formed in LTE, and the abundance derived from this line
matches that derived from high-excitation Al I lines predicted to have minimal
NLTE corrections. The differences between the abundance derived from the Al II

of the multicarrier technique that has shown better bit error performance
compared to cyclic prefixed (CP-)OFDM. Like other multicarrier techniques,
UW-OFDM suffers from the high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) problem, which
is an obstacle ahead of practical implementation of UW-OFDM. In this paper, the
generator matrix, which is inherent to UW-OFDM, is not only used to create the
specific UW-OFDM system, but also to reduce the PAPR. To do so, a suitable
optimization problem is developed, and solved using the Procrustes method. The
main advantage of the proposed method is that the built-in generator matrix
should be calculated only once for each system setting, and the PAPR reduction
(PAPR-R) is achieved without any overhead redundancy. Simulation results are
provided for evaluating the PAPR-R performance of the proposed method.

ferroelectrics, potentially able to revolutionize the whole field. Despite
increasing interests, a comprehensive understanding of the many factors driving
the ferroelectric stabilization is still lacking. We here address the phase
transition in terms of a Landau-theory-based approach, by analyzing
symmetry-allowed distortions connecting the high-symmetry paraelectric
tetragonal phase to the low-symmetry polar orthorhombic phase. By means of
first-principles simulations, we find that the $\Gamma_{3-}$ polar mode is only
weakly unstable, whereas the other two symmetry-allowed distortions, non-polar
Y$_{2+}$ and anti-polar Y$_{4-}$ are hard modes. None of the modes, taken alone
or combined with one other mode, is able to drive the transition: the key
factor in stabilizing the polar phase is identified as the strong trilinear
coupling among the three modes. Furthermore, the experimentally acknowledged
importance of substrate-induced effects in the growth of HfO$_2$ ferroelectric
thin films, along with the lack of a clear order parameter in the transition,
suggested the extension of our analysis to strain effects. Our findings suggest
a complex behaviour of the Y$_{2+}$ mode, which become unstable under certain
strain conditions and an overall unstable behaviour for the $\Gamma_{3-}$ polar
mode for all the strain states. A robust result emerges from our analysis:
independently of the different applied strain (compressive or tensile, applied
along orthorhombic axes), the need of a simultaneous excitation of the three
coupled modes remain unaltered. Finally, when applied to mimic experimental
growth conditions under strain, our analysis show a further stabilization of
the ferroelectric phase with respect to the unstrained case, in agreeement with
experimental findings.

decades because of their importance with spectroscopic observables and geometry
optimization. Here we benchmark the accuracy and statistical cost of QMC
forces. The zero-variance zero-bias (ZVZB) force estimator is used in standard
variational and diffusion Monte Carlo simulations with mean-field based trial
wavefunctions and atomic pseudopotentials. Statistical force uncertainties are
obtained with a recently developed regression technique for heavy tailed QMC
data [P. Lopez Rios and G. J. Conduit, Phys. Rev. E 99, 063312 (2019)]. By
considering selected atoms and dimers with elements ranging from H to Zn
($1\leq Z_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 20$), we assess the accuracy and the
computational cost of ZVZB forces as the effective pseudopotential valence
charge, $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$, increases. We find that the cost of QMC energies
and forces approximately follow simple power laws in $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$. The
force uncertainty grows more rapidly, leading to a best case cost scaling
relationship of approximately $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}^{6.5(3)}$ for DMC. We find the
affordable system size decreases as $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}^{-2}$, insensitive to
model assumptions or the use of ""space warp"" variance reduction. Our results
predict the practical cost of obtaining forces for a range of materials, such
as transition metal oxides where QMC forces have yet to be applied, and
underscore the importance of further developing force variance reduction
techniques, particularly for atoms with high $\zeff$.

orbital period ratio, the inclination of the binary orbit is constrained to
$i>70^\circ$. The most likely range for the companion mass suggests that the
inclination is likely to be closer to this value than $90^\circ$. The eclipses
are also consistent with earlier data, in which strong variability ('flares')
and the long orbital period prevent clear detection of the period or eclipses.
We also find that the bright flares occurred preferentially in the post-eclipse

radius valley may be well-explained by distinct formation timescales between
enveloped terrestrials, and rocky planets that form at late times in a
gas-depleted environment. This scenario is at odds with the picture that
close-in rocky planets form with a primordial gaseous envelope that is
subsequently stripped away by some thermally-driven mass loss process. These
two physical scenarios make unique predictions of the rocky/enveloped
transition's dependence on orbital separation such that studying the
compositions of planets within the M dwarf radius valley may be able to
establish the dominant physics. Here, we present the discovery of one such
keystone planet: the ultra-short period planet TOI-1634 b ($P=0.989$ days,
$F=121 F_{\oplus}$, $r_p = 1.790^{+0.080}_{-0.081} R_{\oplus}$) orbiting a
nearby M2 dwarf ($K_s=8.7$, $R_s=0.45 R_{\odot}$, $M_s=0.50 M_{\odot}$) and
whose size and orbital period sit within the M dwarf radius valley. We confirm
the TESS-discovered planet candidate using extensive ground-based follow-up
campaigns, including a set of 32 precise radial velocity measurements from
HARPS-N. We measure a planetary mass of $4.91^{+0.68}_{-0.70} M_{\oplus}$,
which makes TOI-1634 b inconsistent with an Earth-like composition at
$5.9\sigma$ and thus requires either an extended gaseous envelope, a large
volatile-rich layer, or a rocky portion that is not dominated by iron and
silicates to explain its mass and radius. The discovery that the bulk
composition of TOI-1634 b is inconsistent with that of the Earth favors the
gas-depleted formation mechanism to explain the emergence of the radius valley
around M dwarfs with $M_s\lesssim 0.5 M_{\odot}$.

using a semi-analytical model that fitted well the experimental data. As
defined in this paper, the static CTL on a 2-D domain is a generalization of
the definition commonly used in literature. In addition, we used a 3-D finite
element model to simulate the normal zone propagation in our CFD samples, in
order to quantify their ""dynamic"" CTL ($\lambda_d$), a new concept introduced
in this paper and defined as the CTL observed during the propagation of a
quenched region. The results show that, for a CFD architecture, $\lambda_d$ is
always larger than $\lambda_s$, whereas $\lambda_d = \lambda_s$ when the
interfacial resistance between the stabilizer and the superconductor layers is
the same everywhere. We proved that the cause of these different behaviors is
related to the shape of the normal zone, which is curved for the CFD
architecture, and rectangular otherwise. Finally, we showed that the NZPV is
proportional to $\lambda_d$, not with $\lambda_s$, which suggests that the
dynamic CTL $\lambda_d$ is the most general definition of the CTL and should
always be used when current crowding and non-uniform heat generation occurs
around a normal zone.

non-trivially in time, eventually approaching a stationary state. In typical
situations, the reduced density matrix of a given subsystem begins and ends
this endeavour as a low-entangled vector in the space of operators. This means
that if its operator space entanglement initially grows (which is generically
the case), it must eventually decrease, describing a barrier-shaped curve.
Understanding the shape of this ""entanglement barrier"" is interesting for three
main reasons: (i) it quantifies the dynamics of entanglement in the (open)
subsystem; (ii) it gives information on the approximability of the reduced
density matrix by means of matrix product operators; (iii) it shows qualitative
differences depending on the type of dynamics undergone by the system,
signalling quantum chaos. Here we compute exactly the shape of the entanglement
barriers described by different R\'enyi entropies after quantum quenches in
dual-unitary circuits initialised in a class of solvable matrix product states
(MPS)s. We show that, for free (SWAP-like) circuits, the entanglement entropy
behaves as in rational CFTs. On the other hand, for completely chaotic
dual-unitary circuits it behaves as in holographic CFTs, exhibiting a longer
entanglement barrier that drops rapidly when the subsystem thermalises.
Interestingly, the entanglement spectrum is non-trivial in the completely
chaotic case. Higher R\'enyi entropies behave in an increasingly similar way to
rational CFTs, such that the free and completely chaotic barriers are identical
in the limit of infinite replicas (i.e. for the so called min-entropy). We also
show that, upon increasing the bond dimension of the MPSs, the barrier
maintains the same shape. It simply shifts to the left to accommodate for the
larger initial entanglement.

the high capacity to memorize the noisy labels. In this paper, we propose a
learning algorithm called Co-matching, which balances the consistency and
divergence between two networks by augmentation anchoring. Specifically, we
have one network generate anchoring label from its prediction on a
weakly-augmented image. Meanwhile, we force its peer network, taking the
strongly-augmented version of the same image as input, to generate prediction
close to the anchoring label. We then update two networks simultaneously by
selecting small-loss instances to minimize both unsupervised matching loss
(i.e., measure the consistency of the two networks) and supervised
classification loss (i.e. measure the classification performance). Besides, the
unsupervised matching loss makes our method not heavily rely on noisy labels,
which prevents memorization of noisy labels. Experiments on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate that Co-matching achieves results comparable to the
state-of-the-art methods.

Mars rover mission capabilities, the increase in data complexity has pressured
Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and future Mars rover operations staff to quickly
analyze complex data sets to meet progressively shorter tactical and strategic
planning timelines. MSLWEB is an internal data tracking tool used by operations
staff to perform first pass analysis on MSL image sequences, a series of
products taken by the Mast camera, Mastcam. Mastcam's multiband multispectral
image sequences require more complex analysis compared to standard 3-band RGB
images. Typically, these are analyzed using traditional methods to identify
unique features within the sequence. Given the short time frame of tactical
planning in which downlinked images might need to be analyzed (within 5-10
hours before the next uplink), there exists a need to triage analysis time to
focus on the most important sequences and parts of a sequence. We address this
need by creating products for MSLWEB that use novelty detection to help
operations staff identify unusual data that might be diagnostic of new or
atypical compositions or mineralogies detected within an imaging scene. This
was achieved in two ways: 1) by creating products for each sequence to identify
novel regions in the image, and 2) by assigning multispectral sequences a
sortable novelty score. These new products provide colorized heat maps of
inferred novelty that operations staff can use to rapidly review downlinked
data and focus their efforts on analyzing potentially new kinds of diagnostic
multispectral signatures. This approach has the potential to guide scientists
to new discoveries by quickly drawing their attention to often subtle
variations not detectable with simple color composites.

We present new ALMA CO(1-0) interferometry of cold molecular gas in the nearby

galaxy 2MASSX J23453269-044925, which is outstanding for having two pairs of
powerful, giant radio jets, and a bright X-ray halo. The molecular gas is in a
massive (M_gas=2x10^10 M_sun), 24 kpc wide, rapidly rotating ring, which is
associated with the inner stellar disk. Broad (FWHM=70-180 km s^-1) lines with
complex profiles associated with the radio source are seen over large regions
in the ring, indicating gas velocities that are high enough to keep the
otherwise marginally Toomre-stable gas from fragmenting into gravitationally
bound, star-forming clouds. About 1-2% of the jet kinetic energy are required
to power these motions. Resolved star-formation rate surface densities fall
factors 50-75 short of expectations from the Kennicutt-Schmidt law of
star-forming galaxies, and near gas-rich early-type galaxies with signatures of
star formation lowered by jet feedback. We argue that radio AGN feedback is the
only plausible mechanism to explain the low star-formation rates in this
galaxy. Previous authors have already noted that the X-ray halo of J2345-0449
implies a baryon fraction near the cosmic average, which is very high for a
galaxy. We contrast this finding with other, equally massive baryon-rich spiral
galaxies without prominent radio sources. Most of the baryons in these galaxies
are in stars, not in the halos. We also discuss the implications of our results
for our general understanding of AGN feedback in massive galaxies.

CESIUM creates simulated representations of a system architecture, the

the system as a network of interdependent artifacts designed by agents. Agents
iteratively design their artifacts through optimization and share information
with other agents, thereby advancing the CES toward a solution. This paper

established as a standard procedure for the non-destructive visualization of
flow and transport in opaque porous media. Despite the recent advances in the
field of XRCT, some challenges still remain due to the inherent noise and
imaging artefacts in the produced data. These issues become even more profound
when the objective is the identification of fractures, and/or fracture
networks. The challenge is the limited contrast between the regions of interest
and the neighboring areas. This limited contrast can mostly be attributed to
the minute aperture of the fractures. In order to overcome this challenge, it
has been a common approach to apply digital image processing, such as
filtering, to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, segmentation
methods based on threshold-/morphology schemes can be employed to obtain
enhanced information from the features of interest. However, this workflow
needs a skillful operator to fine-tune its input parameters, and the required
computation time significantly increases due to the complexity of the available
methods, and the large volume of the data-set. In this study, based on a
data-set produced by the successful visualization of a fracture network in
Carrara marble with XRCT, we present the segmentation results from a number of
segmentation methods. Three conventional and two machine-learning-based methods
are evaluated. The segmentation results from all five methods are compared to
each other in terms of segmentation quality and time efficiency. Due to memory
limitations, and in order to accomplish a fair comparison, all the methods are
employed in a 2D scheme. The output of the 2D U-net model, which is one of the
adopted machine-learning-based segmentation methods, shows the best performance
regarding the quality of segmentation and the required processing time.

functional linear models. We demonstrate how to use this approach and compare
it with classical linear models on data from the Czech section of the European

functional linear models explain more observed variance in age at menarche from
height and weight data than the commonly used approaches. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that functional linear models can be used to identify crucial time

presence of Lithium, are all consistent with its membership in the $\beta$

of members of this moving group to distances of at least 70pc.
BD+45$^{\circ}$598 appears to be an example from a population of young
circumstellar debris systems associated with newly identified members of young
moving groups that can be imaged in scattered light, key objects for mapping

learning to develop optimization methods, aiming at reducing the laborious
iterations of hand engineering. It automates the design of an optimization
method based on its performance on a set of training problems. This data-driven
procedure generates methods that can efficiently solve problems similar to
those in the training. In sharp contrast, the typical and traditional designs
of optimization methods are theory-driven, so they obtain performance
guarantees over the classes of problems specified by the theory. The difference
makes L2O suitable for repeatedly solving a certain type of optimization
problems over a specific distribution of data, while it typically fails on
out-of-distribution problems. The practicality of L2O depends on the type of
target optimization, the chosen architecture of the method to learn, and the

therefore provides parameters for 1743 open clusters and, as a byproduct, a
list of likely not physical or dubious open clusters is provided as well for
future investigations. Furthermore, it was possible to estimate the mean radial
velocity of 831 clusters (198 of which are new and unpublished so far) using
stellar radial velocities from Gaia DR2 catalog. By comparing the open cluster
distances obtained from isochrone fitting with those obtained from a maximum

Colonel Blotto game (CBG) under a dynamic setting and analyze the problem using
an online learning approach. In this model, one of the players is a learner who
has limited troops to allocate over a finite time horizon, and the other player
is an adversary. In each round, the learner plays a one-shot Colonel Blotto
game with the adversary and strategically determines the allocation of troops
among battlefields based on past observations. The adversary chooses its
allocation action randomly from some fixed distribution that is unknown to the
learner. The learner's objective is to minimize its regret, which is the
difference between the cumulative reward of the best mixed strategy and the
realized cumulative reward by following a learning algorithm while not
violating the budget constraint. The learning in dynamic CBG is analyzed under
the framework of combinatorial bandits and bandits with knapsacks. We first
convert the budget-constrained dynamic CBG to a path planning problem on a
directed graph. We then devise an efficient algorithm that combines a special
combinatorial bandit algorithm for path planning problem and a bandits with
knapsack algorithm to cope with the budget constraint. The theoretical analysis
shows that the learner's regret is bounded by a term sublinear in time horizon
and polynomial in other parameters. Finally, we justify our theoretical results
by carrying out simulations for various scenarios.

efficient evaluation of Volterra integral operators in an evolutionary manner.
After appropriate discretisation, the basic problem can be represented as a
matrix-vector product with a lower diagonal but densely populated matrix. For
typical applications, like fractional diffusion or large scale dynamical
systems with delay, the memory cost for storing the matrix approximations and
complete history of the data then would become prohibitive for an accurate
numerical approximation. For Volterra-integral operators of convolution type,
the \emph{fast and oblivious convolution quadrature} method of Sch\""adle,
Lopez-Fernandez, and Lubich allows to compute the discretized valuation with
$N$ time steps in $O(N \log N)$ complexity and only requiring $O(\log N)$
active memory to store a compressed version of the complete history of the
data. We will show that this algorithm can be interpreted as an
$\mathcal{H}$-matrix approximation of the underlying integral operator and,
consequently, a further improvement can be achieved, in principle, by resorting
to $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrix compression techniques. We formulate a variant of the
$\mathcal{H}^2$-matrix vector product for discretized Volterra integral
operators that can be performed in an evolutionary and oblivious manner and
requires only $O(N)$ operations and $O(\log N)$ active memory. In addition to
the acceleration, more general asymptotically smooth kernels can be treated and
the algorithm does not require a-priori knowledge of the number of time steps.
The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by application to some
typical test problems.

several times throughout their life-cycle; and these upgrades may affect the

each upgrade request are identified, scheduled, and applied automatically in an
iterative manner based on the vendors descriptions of the infrastructure

approach allows new upgrade requests during ongoing upgrades, which makes it
suitable for continuous delivery.In addition, it also handles failures of
upgrade actions through localized retry and undo operations automatically.

mechanisms by which such beliefs are accepted, spread, and intensified is
critical for any attempt to mitigate radicalization and avoid increased

media network that enables investigation of the effects of censorship on the
amount of dissenting information to which agents become exposed and the
certainty of their radicalized views. The model explores two forms of
censorship: 1) decentralized censorship-in which individuals can choose to
break an online social network tie (unfriend or unfollow) with another
individual who transmits conflicting beliefs and 2) centralized censorship-in
which a single authority can ban an individual from the social media network
for spreading a certain type of belief. This model suggests that both forms of
censorship increase certainty in radicalized views by decreasing the amount of
dissent to which an agent is exposed, but centralized ""banning"" of individuals
has the strongest effect on radicalization.

misclassification in the binary outcomes derived from electronic health
records. We revisit the classical logistic regression model with misclassified
outcomes. Despite that local identification conditions in some related settings
have been previously established, the global identification of such models
remains largely unknown and is an important question yet to be answered. We
derive necessary and sufficient conditions for global identifiability of

termed as the submodel analysis, and a technique adapted from the

particular, our results are applicable to logistic models with discrete

indifferent to both candidates, ideologically motivated third-party
alternatives that attract extreme voters, and a bimodal distribution of voter

configurations in the drift region, obtained using Heed and Geant4, are found
to have significant effect on the subsequent evolution of detector response.
Simulation of energy resolution has been performed to establish the capability
of the hydrodynamic model to capture statistical nature of the experimental
situation. Finally, single and triple GEM configurations exposed to alpha
sources have been simulated to estimate discharge probability which have been
compared with available experimental data. Despite the simplifying and drastic
assumptions in the numerical model, the comparisons are encouraging.

principle -- possible to perturbatively expand the background to obtain
higher-point vacuum amplitudes. In the case of self-dual plane wave backgrounds
we consider this expansion for two-point, one-loop amplitudes in pure
Yang-Mills, QED and QCD. This enables us to obtain multicollinear limits of
1-loop vacuum amplitudes; the resulting helicity configurations are
surprisingly restricted, with only the all-plus helicity amplitude surviving.
These results are shown to be consistent with well-known vacuum amplitudes. We
also show that for both abelian and non-abelian supersymmetric gauge theories,
there is no helicity flip (and hence no vacuum birefringence) on any plane wave
background, generalising a result previously known in the Euler-Heisenberg

build a pretrained classifier on the source data and adapt this model to new

also tackle situations where we do not have access to ground-truth labels on

tasks employ covariates such as age, gender and race which are easy to obtain

techniques for probing exoplanetary atmospheres. We present multiple
VLT/ESPRESSO transit observations of the hot-Jupiter exoplanet WASP-19b with
previously published but disputed atmospheric features from low resolution
studies. Through spectral synthesis and modeling of the Rossiter-McLaughlin
(RM) effect we calculate stellar, orbital and physical parameters for the
system. From narrow-band spectroscopy we do not detect any of H\,I, Fe\,I,
Mg\,I, Ca\,I, Na\,I and K\,I neutral species, placing upper limits on their
line contrasts. Through cross correlation analyses with atmospheric models, we
do not detect Fe\,I and place a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of
$\log\,(X_{\textrm{Fe}}/X_\odot) \approx -1.83\,\pm\,0.11$ on its mass
fraction, from injection and retrieval. We show the inability to detect the
presence of H$_2$O for known abundances, owing to lack of strong absorption
bands, as well as relatively low S/N ratio. We detect a barely significant peak
(3.02\,$\pm$\,0.15\,$\sigma$) in the cross correlation map for TiO, consistent
with the sub-solar abundance previously reported. This is merely a hint for the
presence of TiO and does \textit{not} constitute a confirmation. However, we do
confirm the presence of previously observed enhanced scattering towards blue
wavelengths, through chromatic RM measurements, pointing to a hazy atmosphere.
We finally present a reanalysis of low resolution transmission spectra of this
exoplanet, concluding that unocculted starspots alone cannot explain previously
detected features. Our reanalysis of the FORS2 spectra of WASP-19b finds a
$\sim$\,100$\times$ sub-solar TiO abundance, precisely constrained to
$\log\,X_{\textrm{TiO}} \approx -7.52 \pm 0.38$, consistent with the TiO hint
from ESPRESSO. We present plausible paths to reconciliation with other
seemingly contradicting results.

bistability from a nonlinear resource in a dissipatively coupled two-mode
system. As a clear advantage over coherently coupled settings, the dissipative
nature of interaction is found to support a lower pumping threshold for
bistable signals. For comparable parameters, the bistability threshold for
dissipatively coupled systems is lower by a factor of about five. The resulting
hysteresis can be studied spectroscopically by applying a probe field through
the waveguide and examining the polariton character of the transmitted field.
Our model is generic, apropos of an extensive set of quantum systems, and we
demonstrate our results in the context of magnonics where experimental interest
has flourished of late. As a consequence of dissipative coupling and the
nonlinearity, a long-lived mode emerges, which is responsible for heightened
transmission levels and pronounced sensitivity in signal propagation through
the fiber.

and future observations will provide stronger limits on the neutron stars
parameters, knowledge of explicit interior solutions to Einstein's equations,
which connect observed parameters with the internal structure, are crucial to
have a satisfactory description of the interior of these compact objects. A
well known exact solution, which has shown a relatively good approximation to a

for the energy density profile, with the realistic equations of state for

interplay of the quadratic and the newly added quartic term in the energy

teacher-explorer-student (T/E/S) learning, which adopts the concept of open set
recognition (OSR) that aims to reject unknown samples while minimizing the loss
of classification performance on known samples, is proposed in this study. In
this novel learning method, overgeneralization of deep learning classifiers is
significantly reduced by exploring various possibilities of unknowns. Here, the
teacher network extracts some hints about unknowns by distilling the pretrained
knowledge about knowns and delivers this distilled knowledge to the student.
After learning the distilled knowledge, the student network shares the learned
information with the explorer network. Then, the explorer network shares its
exploration results by generating unknown-like samples and feeding the samples
to the student network. By repeating this alternating learning process, the
student network experiences a variety of synthetic unknowns, reducing
overgeneralization. Extensive experiments were conducted, and the experimental
results showed that each component proposed in this paper significantly
contributes to the improvement in OSR performance. As a result, the proposed

exoplanets detected via direct-imaging are often only observed over a very
small fraction of their period, making it challenging to perform reliable
physical inferences given wide, unconstrained posteriors. The aim of this
project is to investigate biases (deviation of the median and mode of the
posterior from the true values of orbital parameters, and the width and
coverage of their credible intervals) in the estimation of orbital parameters
of directly-imaged exoplanets, particularly their eccentricities, and to define
general guidelines to perform better estimations of uncertainty. For this, we
constructed various orbits and generated mock data for each spanning $\sim 0.5
\%$ of the orbital period. We used the Orbits For The Impatient (OFTI)
algorithm to compute orbit posteriors, and compared those to the true values of
the orbital parameters. We found that the inclination of the orbital plane is
the parameter that most affects our estimations of eccentricity, with orbits
that appear near edge-on producing eccentricity distributions skewed away from
the true values, and often bi-modal. We also identified a degeneracy between
eccentricity and inclination that makes it difficult to distinguish posteriors
of face-on, eccentric orbits and edge-on, circular orbits. For the
exoplanet-imaging community, we propose practical recommendations, guidelines

and in the maintenance of a complex body. Experiments in collective cell
migration generally measure quantities such as cell displacement and velocity.
The observed short-time diffusion regime for mean square displacement in
single-cell migration experiments on flat surfaces calls into question the
definition of cell velocity and the measurement protocol. Theoretical results
in stochastic modeling for single-cell migration have shown that this fast
diffusive regime is explained by a white noise acting on displacement on the
direction perpendicular to the migrating cell polarization axis (not on
velocity). The prediction is that only the component of velocity parallel to
the polarization axis is a well-defined quantity, with a robust measurement
protocol. Here, we ask whether we can find a definition of a migrating-cell
polarization that is able to predict the cell's subsequent displacement, based
on measurements of its shape. Supported by experimental evidence that cell
nucleus lags behind the cell center of mass in a migrating cell, we propose a
robust parametrization for cell migration where the distance between cell
nucleus and the cell's center of mass defines cell shape polarization. We
tested the proposed methods by applying to a simulation model for
three-dimensional cells performed in the CompuCell3D environment, previously
shown to reproduce biological cells kinematics migrating on a flat surface.

delivering aggressive and robust performance in many challenging control tasks,
coping with nonlinear system dynamics, constraints, and observational noise.
Despite their success, these methods often rely on simple control
distributions, which can limit their performance in highly uncertain and
complex environments. MPC frameworks must be able to accommodate changing
distributions over system parameters, based on the most recent measurements. In
this paper, we devise an implicit variational inference algorithm able to
estimate distributions over model parameters and control inputs on-the-fly. The
method incorporates Stein Variational gradient descent to approximate the
target distributions as a collection of particles, and performs updates based
on a Bayesian formulation. This enables the approximation of complex
multi-modal posterior distributions, typically occurring in challenging and
realistic robot navigation tasks. We demonstrate our approach on both simulated

Significant discrepancies between theory and observations have been identified,
the most striking affecting ultramassive white dwarfs. Cheng et al. (2019)
found that a small fraction of white dwarfs on the so-called Q branch must
experience an extra cooling delay of $\sim 8\,$Gyr not predicted by current
models. $^{22}$Ne phase separation in a crystallizing C/O white dwarf can lead
to a distillation process that efficiently transports $^{22}$Ne toward its
center, thereby releasing a considerable amount of gravitational energy. Using
state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this mechanism can
largely resolve the ultramassive cooling anomaly if the delayed population
consists of white dwarfs with moderately above-average $^{22}$Ne abundances. We
also argue that $^{22}$Ne phase separation can account for the smaller cooling
delay currently missing for models of white dwarfs with more standard

displacement of a high viscosity fluid subject to the radial injection of a
less viscous fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell. The displaced fluid can leave behind a
trailing film that coats the cell walls, dynamically affecting the pressure
drop at the fluid interface. By considering the non-linear pressure drop in a
boundary element formulation, we construct a Picard scheme to iteratively
predict the interfacial velocity and subsequent displacement in finite mobility
ratio flow regimes. Dynamic wetting delays the onset of finger bifurcation in
the late stages of interfacial growth, and at high local capillary numbers can
alter the fundamental mode of bifurcation, producing vastly different finger
morphologies. In low mobility ratio regimes, we see that finger interaction is
reduced and characteristic finger breaking mechanisms are delayed but never
fully inhibited. In high mobility ratio regimes, finger shielding is reduced
when dynamic wetting is present. Finger bifurcation is delayed which allows the
primary fingers to advance further into the domain before secondary fingers are
generated, reducing the level of competition.

behind SETGAN for an image generation task is for a given input image, we train
a GAN on a remote server and use the trained model on edge devices. We use
SinGAN, a single image unconditional generative model, that contains a pyramid
of fully convolutional GANs, each responsible for learning the patch
distribution at a different scale of the image. During the training process, we
determine the optimal number of scales for a given input image and the energy
constraint from the target edge device. Results show that with SETGAN's unique
client-server-based architecture, we were able to achieve a 56% gain in energy
for a loss of 3% to 12% SSIM accuracy. Also, with the parallel multi-scale

The input to
the problem is a colored graph $(G,\varphi)$, i.e., a graph together with a
coloring on its vertices. We can associate to each colored graph a cluster
graph ($G_\varphi)$ in which, after collapsing to a node all vertices with the
same color, we remove multiple edges and self-loops. A set of vertices $S$ is
multicolored when $S$ has exactly one vertex from each color class. The problem
is to decide whether there is a multicolored set $S$ such that, after
identifying each vertex in $S$ with its color class, $G[S]$ coincides with
$G_\varphi$.
  The MGR problem is related to the class of generalized network problems, most
of which are NP-hard. For example the generalized MST problem. MGRP is a
generalization of the Multicolored Clique Problem, which is known to be
W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number of colors. Thus MGRP remains
W[1]-hard, when parameterized by the size of the cluster graph and when
parameterized by any graph parameter on $G_\varphi$, among those for treewidth.
We look to instances of the problem in which both the number of color classes
and the treewidth of $G_\varphi$ are unbounded. We show that MGRP is
NP-complete when $G_\varphi$ is either chordal, biconvex bipartite, complete
bipartite or a 2-dimensional grid. Our hardness results follows from suitable
reductions from the 1-in-3 monotone SAT problem. Our reductions show that the
problem remains hard even when the maximum number of vertices in a color class
is 3. In the case of the grid, the hardness holds also graphs with bounded
degree. We complement those results by showing combined parameterizations under
which the MGR problem became tractable.

representations. ReSim operates by sliding a fixed-sized window across the
overlapping area between two views (e.g., image crops), aligning these areas

  Quality Data","11 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomaly detection plays a key role in air quality analysis by enhancing
situational awareness and alerting users to potential hazards. However,
existing anomaly detection approaches for air quality analysis have their own
limitations regarding parameter selection (e.g., need for extensive domain
knowledge), computational expense, general applicability (e.g., require labeled
data), interpretability, and the efficiency of analysis. Furthermore, the poor
quality of collected air quality data (inconsistently formatted and sometimes
missing) also increases the difficulty of analysis substantially. In this
paper, we systematically formulate design requirements for a system that can
solve these limitations and then propose AQEyes, an integrated visual analytics
system for efficiently monitoring, detecting, and examining anomalies in air
quality data. In particular, we propose a unified end-to-end tunable machine
learning pipeline that includes several data pre-processors and featurizers to
deal with data quality issues. The pipeline integrates an efficient
unsupervised anomaly detection method that works without the use of labeled
data and overcomes the limitations of existing approaches. Further, we develop
an interactive visualization system to visualize the outputs from the pipeline.
The system incorporates a set of novel visualization and interaction designs,
allowing analysts to visually examine air quality dynamics and anomalous events
in multiple scales and from multiple facets. We demonstrate the performance of
this pipeline through a quantitative evaluation and show the effectiveness of
the visualization system using qualitative case studies on real-world datasets.

  Systems",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we study multi-agent systems with decentralized resource
allocations. Agents have local demand and resource supply, and are
interconnected through a network designed to support sharing of the local
resource; and the network has no external resource supply. It is known from
classical welfare economics theory that by pricing the flow of resource,
balance between the demand and supply is possible. Agents decide on the
consumed resource, and perhaps further the traded resource as well, to maximize
their payoffs considering both the utility of the consumption, and the income
from the trading. When the network supply and demand are balanced, a
competitive equilibrium is achieved if all agents maximize their individual
payoffs, and a social welfare equilibrium is achieved if the total agent
utilities are maximized. First, we consider multi-agent systems with static
local allocations, and prove from duality theory that under general convexity
assumptions, the competitive equilibrium and the social welfare equilibrium
exist and agree. Compared to similar results in the literature based on KKT
arguments, duality theory provides a direct way for connecting the two notions
and for a more general (e.g. nonsmooth) class of utility functions. Next, we
show that the agent utility functions can be prescribed in a family of socially
admissible functions, under which the resource price at the competitive
equilibrium is kept below a threshold. Finally, we extend the study to
dynamical multi-agent systems where agents are associated with dynamical states
from linear processes, and we prove that the dynamic the competitive
equilibrium and social welfare equilibrium continue to exist and coincide with
each other.

a complex phenomenon bringing many difficulties to both numerical and

structure may provide certain information of its reactive front, but the
corresponding lead shock needs to be reconstructed building the complete flow
field. Using the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) approach, we propose in this
study a shock front reconstruction method which can predict evolution of the
lead shock wavefront from the state of the reactive front. The method is
verified through the numerical results of one- and two-dimensional unstable
detonations based on the reactive Euler equations with a one-step irreversible
chemical reaction model. Results show that the accuracy of the proposed method
depends on the activation energy of the reactive mixture, which influences
prominently the cellular detonation instability and hence, the distortion of
the lead shock surface. To select the input variables for training and evaluate
their influence on the effectiveness of the proposed method, five groups, one
with six variables and the other with four variables, are tested and analyzed
in the MLP model. The trained MLP is tested in the cases with different
activation energies, demonstrates the inspiring generalization capability. This
paper offers a universal framework for predicting detonation frontal evolution
and provides a novel way to interpret numerical and experimental results of
detonation waves.

adversarial vulnerability. Mahloujifar et al. presented an empirical way to
measure the concentration of a data distribution using samples, and employed it
to find lower bounds on intrinsic robustness for several benchmark datasets.
However, it remains unclear whether these lower bounds are tight enough to
provide a useful approximation for the intrinsic robustness of a dataset. To
gain a deeper understanding of the concentration of measure phenomenon, we
first extend the Gaussian Isoperimetric Inequality to non-spherical Gaussian
measures and arbitrary $\ell_p$-norms ($p \geq 2$). We leverage these
theoretical insights to design a method that uses half-spaces to estimate the
concentration of any empirical dataset under $\ell_p$-norm distance metrics.
Our proposed algorithm is more efficient than Mahloujifar et al.'s, and our
experiments on synthetic datasets and image benchmarks demonstrate that it is
able to find much tighter intrinsic robustness bounds. These tighter estimates
provide further evidence that rules out intrinsic dataset concentration as a
possible explanation for the adversarial vulnerability of state-of-the-art

mechanism of buffet is buried underneath the global low-Reynolds-number flow
physics. At this low Reynolds number, the dominant flow feature is the von

buffet can appear even at a Reynolds number that is much lower than what is
traditionally associated with transonic buffet. The source of buffet is
identified to be at the shock foot from the windowed resolvent analysis, which
is validated by companion simulations using sustained forcing inputs based on
resolvent modes. We also comment on the role of perturbations in the vicinity
of the trailing edge. The present study not only provides insights on the
origin of buffet but also serves a building block for low-Reynolds-number

reuse and the incremental updates couple large iteration complexity into the
sample complexity. These characteristics have been observed in experiments as

enhancements, such as enabling data reuse, and uses more refined analysis
techniques, which we expect to be more broadly applicable to designing new

  for High-Efficiency Solar Cells","9 figures, 22 pages",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The incompatibility between defect-tolerance and structural stability is a
severe issue hindering the wide application of high-efficiency solar cells.
Usually, covalent/polar semiconductors with prototype of Si/CdTe crystals
exhibit great structural stability owing to their compactly composed
tetrahedral building blocks, but present extremely poor defect-tolerance due to
the similar electronegativity of component elements. On the contrary, ionic
semiconductors, such as perovskite series, always exhibit benign electronic
properties of intrinsic defects owing to the great disparity of
electronegativity between anions and cations, but are structurally unstable
because of the sparsely composed octahedral building blocks supported by large
cations. Combining the stable framework of covalent semiconductors and benign
defects of ionic compounds, we find that HgX2S4 (X=In, Sc and Y) spinel
semiconductors possess both the merits. The tightly combined tetrahedral and
octahedral blocks ensures the structural stability, and the band edge of ionic
characteristic, which is mainly dominated by Hg-6s and S-3p orbitals for
conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM), respectively,
makes HgX2S4 defect-tolerant. The prominent downward bending of CBM caused by
spatially spreading Hg-6s spherical orbital not only induces a suitable optical
band gap which is often too large in ionic compounds, but also promotes the
formation and transport of n-type carriers. This study presents that Hg-based
chalcogenide spinels are promising candidates for high-efficiency solar cells,
and suggests that adopting cations with delocalized orbitals under the

detect software exploits with minimal overhead, since these MCUs are designed
for low cost, low energy and small size. Some recent work yielded inexpensive
hardware/software co-designs for remotely verifying code and execution
integrity. In particular, a means of detecting unauthorized code modifications
and control-flow attacks were proposed, referred to as Remote Attestation (RA)
and Control-Flow Attestation (CFA), respectively. Despite this progress,
detection of data-only attacks remains elusive. Such attacks exploit software
vulnerabilities to corrupt intermediate computation results stored in data
memory, changing neither the program code nor its control flow. Motivated by
lack of any current techniques (for low-end MCUs) that detect these attacks, in
this paper we propose, implement and evaluate DIALED, the first Data-Flow
Attestation (DFA) technique applicable to the most resource-constrained
embedded devices (e.g., TI MSP430). DIALED works in tandem with a companion CFA
scheme to detect all (currently known) types of runtime software exploits at

in the spatially one-dimensional setting, we construct the unique
global-in-time solution near a local Maxwellian whose fluid quantities are the
viscous contact waves in the sense of hydrodynamics and also prove that the
solution tends toward such local Maxwellian in large time. The result is proved
by elaborate energy estimates and seems the first one on the dynamical
stability of contact waves for the Landau equation. One key point of the proof
is to introduce a new time-velocity weight function that includes an
exponential factor of the form $\exp (q(t)\langle \xi\rangle^2)$ with $$
q(t):=q_1-q_2\int_0^tq_3(s)\,ds, $$ where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are given positive
constants and $q_3(\cdot)$ is defined by the energy dissipation rate of the
solution itself. The time derivative of such weight function is able to induce
an extra quartic dissipation term for treating the large-velocity growth in the
nonlinear estimates due to degeneration of the linearized Landau operator in
the Coulomb case. Note that in our problem the explicit time-decay of solutions
around contact waves is unavailable but no longer needed under the crucial use
of the above weight function, which is different from the situation in [11,

to interact with a city is proportional to the number of opportunities in the
destination city and inversely proportional to the number of intervening
opportunities between the origin city and the destination city, calculated
using the travel time in the transportation network. The intercity interaction
intensity can be obtained by calculating the product of this probability and
the origin city's population. We apply the ICC model to measure the interaction
intensity among 339 cities in China and analyze the impact of changes in the
Chinese land transportation network from 2005 to 2018 on the intercity and city
interaction intensity. Compared with the previously widely used spatial

by real-world markets, we consider an online setting: individuals have linear,
additive utility functions; items arrive sequentially and must be allocated and
priced irrevocably. We define the notion of an online market equilibrium in
such a market as time-indexed allocations and prices which guarantee buyer
optimality and market clearance in hindsight. We propose a simple, scalable and
interpretable allocation and pricing dynamics termed as PACE. When items are
drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution (with a possibly continuous support),
we show that PACE leads to an online market equilibrium asymptotically. In
particular, PACE ensures that buyers' time-averaged utilities converge to the
equilibrium utilities w.r.t. a static market with item supplies being the
unknown distribution and that buyers' time-averaged expenditures converge to
their per-period budget. Hence, many desirable properties of market
equilibrium-based fair division such as no envy, Pareto optimality, and the
proportional-share guarantee are also attained asymptotically in the online
setting. Next, we extend the dynamics to handle quasilinear buyer utilities,
which gives the first online algorithm for computing first-price pacing
equilibria. Finally, numerical experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that the dynamics converges quickly under various metrics.

the presence of a white-in-time and spatially smooth stochastic source term and
studies the long-time behavior of solutions. We show that the integrals of

invariant measures for damped stochastic KdV. First, by considering non-trivial
modifications of the integrals of motion, we establish Lyapunov structure by
proving that moments of Sobolev norms of solutions at all orders of regularity
are bounded globally-in-time; existence of invariant measures follows as an
immediate consequence. Next, we prove a weak Foias-Prodi type estimate for
damped stochastic KdV, for which the synchronization occurs in expected value.
This estimate plays a crucial role throughout our subsequent analysis. As a
first novel application, we combine the Foias-Prodi estimate with the Lyapunov
structure to establish that invariant measures are supported on $C^\infty$
functions provided that the external driving forces belong to $C^\infty$. We
then establish ergodic properties of invariant measures, treating the regimes
of arbitrary damping and large damping separately. For arbitrary damping, we
demonstrate that the framework of `asymptotic coupling' can be implemented for
a compact proof of uniqueness of the invariant measure provided that
sufficiently many directions in phase space are stochastically forced. Our
proof is paradigmatic for SPDEs for which a weak Foias-Prodi type property
holds. Lastly, for large damping, we establish the existence of a spectral gap
with respect to a Wasserstein-like distance, and exponential mixing and
uniqueness of the invariant measure follows.

to chemistry, biology and material sciences. In the three-dimensional Euclidean

for tetrahedra must be a pseudovector with at least two components. In light of
this, we propose a two-component pseudovectoral chirality function for
tetrahedra that satisfies all the desirable properties. We plan to use this

paradigm of facile skyrmionic networks with mutually-orthogonal orientations of
constituent isolated skyrmions. Such networks are envisioned as a novel concept
of spintronic devices and are presumably responsible for precursor phenomena
near the ordering temperatures of bulk cubic helimagnets. In particular, we
demonstrate an interconversion between mutually orthogonal skyrmions:
horizontal skyrmions swirl into an intermediate spring-like states and
subsequently squeeze into vertical skyrmions with both polarities. Skyrmion
tubes are also considered as building blocks for particle-like states with more
involved internal structure. A family of target-skyrmions, which includes an
overlooked so far type with a multiple topological charge, is formed owing to
the tendency to minimize the interaction energy between vertical and horizontal
skyrmions. The conical phase serves as a suitable background for considered
skyrmion evolution. It substantializes the attracting skyrmion-skyrmion
interaction in the skyrmionic networks, shapes their internal structure and
guides the nucleation processes. Alternatively, intricate textural changes of
isolated skyrmions result not only in the structural deformations of a host
conical state, but may lead to the formation of an exotic skyrmion order with
pairs of merons being the core of the game. Generically, the fundamental
insights provided by this work emphasize a three-dimensional character of

particular, we analytically derive sufficient conditions on the external

Brownian particles in thermal equilibrium, based on the stationary-state
solutions of the corresponding Smoluchowski equation. We show for a wide
spectrum of tight-binding potentials, the desirable DHU states of Brownian

of an initial density distribution (hyperuniform or non-hyperuniform) to the
desirable equilibrium DHU state determined by the prescribed external

collocation points. Although this optimization problem is infinite-dimensional,
it can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one by introducing additional

point clouds into the volume, which enables us to propagate valid information

correspondences. Thus, it allows us to fuse two different input modalities
seamlessly and regress a long-range depth map. Our fusion is further enhanced
by a newly proposed feature extraction layer for point clouds guided by images:
FusionConv. FusionConv extracts point cloud features that consider both
semantic (2D image domain) and geometric (3D domain) relations and aid fusion

  asymptotic robustness","34 pages, 3 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The issue of combining individual $p$-values to aggregate multiple small
effects is prevalent in many scientific investigations and is a long-standing
statistical topic. Many classical methods are designed for combining
independent and frequent signals in a traditional meta-analysis sense using the
sum of transformed $p$-values with the transformation of light-tailed
distributions, in which Fisher's method and Stouffer's method are the most
well-known. Since the early 2000, advances in big data promoted methods to
aggregate independent, sparse and weak signals, such as the renowned higher
criticism and Berk-Jones tests. Recently, Liu and Xie(2020) and Wilson(2019)
independently proposed Cauchy and harmonic mean combination tests to robustly
combine $p$-values under ""arbitrary"" dependency structure, where a notable
application is to combine $p$-values from a set of often correlated SNPs in
genome-wide association studies. The proposed tests are the transformation of
heavy-tailed distributions for improved power with the sparse signal. It calls
for a natural question to investigate heavy-tailed distribution transformation,
to understand the connection among existing methods, and to explore the
conditions for a method to possess robustness to dependency. In this paper, we
investigate the regularly varying distribution, which is a rich family of
heavy-tailed distribution and includes Pareto distribution as a special case.
We show that only an equivalent class of Cauchy and harmonic mean tests have
sufficient robustness to dependency in a practical sense. We also show an issue
caused by large negative penalty in the Cauchy method and propose a simple, yet
practical modification. Finally, we present simulations and apply to a
neuroticism GWAS application to verify the discovered theoretical insights and
provide practical guidance.

cones is used to generate the feasible regions of velocities for the host
agent. By this approach, the motion planning is conducted at the velocity level
instead of the position level. Thus, it guarantees a safer collision-free
trajectory for the multi-agent system, especially for the systems with
high-speed moving agents. Moreover, a probability threshold of potential
collisions can be satisfied during the motion planning process. In order to
validate the effectiveness of the methodology, different scenarios for multiple
agents are investigated, and the simulation results clearly show that the
proposed approach can effectively avoid potential collisions with a collision
probability less than a specific threshold.

systems has led to a widespread integration of renewable power generation at
customer side. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy poses new
challenges to the network operational planning with underlying uncertainties.
This paper proposes a novel Bayesian probabilistic technique for forecasting
renewable solar generation by addressing data and model uncertainties by
integrating bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural networks while
compressing the weight parameters using variational autoencoder (VAE). Existing
Bayesian deep learning methods suffer from high computational complexities as
they require to draw a large number of samples from weight parameters expressed
in the form of probability distributions. The proposed method can deal with
uncertainty present in model and data in a more computationally efficient
manner by reducing the dimensionality of model parameters. The proposed method
is evaluated using quantile loss, reconstruction error, and deterministic
forecasting evaluation metrics such as root-mean square error. It is inferred
from the numerical results that VAE-Bayesian BiLSTM outperforms other
probabilistic and deterministic deep learning methods for solar power
forecasting in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency for different
sizes of the dataset.

explored in recent years due to methodological advancesand increased data
availability. However, the high costs of annotations hinder the collection of
large and completely labeled datasets, motivating semi-supervised detection
approaches. In this paper, we introduce mean teacher hetero-modal detection
(MTHD), which addresses two important gaps in current semi-supervised
detection. First, it is not obvious how to enforce unlabeled consistency
constraints across the very different outputs of various detectors, which has
resulted in various compromises being used in the state of the art. Using an
anchor-free framework, MTHD formulates a mean teacher approach without such
compromises, enforcing consistency on the soft-output of object centers and
size. Second, multi-sequence data is often critical, e.g., for abdominal lesion
detection, but unlabeled data is often missing sequences. To deal with this,
MTHD incorporates hetero-modal learning in its framework. Unlike prior art,
MTHD is able to incorporate an expansive set of consistency constraints that
include geometric transforms and random sequence combinations. We train and
evaluate MTHD on liver lesion detection using the largest MR lesion dataset to
date (1099 patients with >5000 volumes). MTHD surpasses the best
fully-supervised and semi-supervised competitors by 10.1% and 3.5%,
respectively, in average sensitivity.

reveal that epitaxial strain induces an additional crystal field splitting and
changes the order of Ru d orbital energies, which alters the Berry curvature

Furthermore, we show that the rotation of Ru magnetic moment in real space of

anomalous Hall resistivity with the sweeping of magnetic field, resembling the

it difficult to find local neighbors efficiently. The voxel-based view is
regular, but sparse, and computation grows cubically when voxel resolution
increases. The range-based view is regular and generally dense, however
spherical projection makes physical dimensions distorted. Both voxel- and
range-based views suffer from quantization loss, especially for voxels when

alleviate their own shortcomings in fine-grained segmentation task, we propose
a novel range-point-voxel fusion network, namely RPVNet. In this network, we
devise a deep fusion framework with multiple and mutual information
interactions among these three views and propose a gated fusion module (termed

operate on single input data. It remains an open problem how to extend
counterfactual-based XAI methods to DTA models, which have two inputs, one for

loss in explanation validity, as measured by encoding similarity and QED. We

near the speed of light is presented and compared against fully kinetic
particle-in-cell simulations. These wakefields are excited by intense particle
beams or lasers pushing plasma electrons radially outward, creating an ion
bubble surrounded by a sheath of electrons characterized by the source term $S
\equiv -\frac{1}{en_p}(\rho-J_z/c)$ where $\rho$ and $J_z$ are the charge and
axial current densities. Previously, the sheath source term was described
phenomenologically with a positive-definite function, resulting in a positive
definite wake potential. In reality, the wake potential is negative at the rear
of the ion column which is important for self-injection and accurate beam
loading models. To account for this, we introduce a multi-sheath model in which
the source term, $S$, of the plasma wake can be negative in regions outside the
ion bubble. Using this model, we obtain a new expression for the wake potential
and a modified differential equation for the bubble radius. Numerical results
obtained from these equations are validated against particle-in-cell
simulations for unloaded and loaded wakes. The new model provides accurate
predictions of the shape and duration of trailing bunch current profiles that
flatten plasma wakefields. It is also used to design a trailing bunch for a
desired longitudinally varying loaded wakefield. We present beam loading
results for laser wakefields and discuss how the model can be improved for
laser drivers in future work. Finally, we discuss differences between the
predictions of the multi- and single-sheath models for beam loading.

  Stokes-like operator based approach","15 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detection of entanglement in quantum states is one of the most important
problems in quantum information processing. However, it is one of the most
challenging tasks to find a universal scheme which is also desired to be
optimal to detect entanglement for all states of a specific class--as always
preferred by experimentalists. Although, the topic is well studied at least in
case of lower dimensional compound systems, e.g., two-qubit systems, but in the
case of continuous variable systems, this remains as an open problem. Even in
the case of two-mode Gaussian states, the problem is not fully solved. In our
work, we have tried to address this issue. At first, a limited number of
Hermitian operators is given to test the necessary and sufficient criterion on
the covariance matrix of separable two-mode Gaussian states. Thereafter, we
present an interferometric scheme to test the same separability criterion in
which the measurements are being done via Stokes-like operators. In such case,
we consider only single-copy measurements on a two-mode Gaussian state at a
time and the scheme amounts to the full state tomography. Although this latter
approach is a linear optics based one, nevertheless it is not an economic
scheme. Resource-wise a more economical scheme than the full state tomography
is obtained if we consider measurements on two copies of the state at a time.
However, optimality of the scheme is not yet known.

greatly increase the label efficiency, we explore a new problem, i.e., adaptive

robotic surgical videos from multiple target domains, only given the annotated
instruments in the first frame. We propose MDAL, a meta-learning based dynamic
online adaptive learning scheme with a two-stage framework to fast adapt the
model parameters on the first frame and partial subsequent frames while
predicting the results. MDAL learns the general knowledge of instruments and
the fast adaptation ability through the video-specific meta-learning paradigm.
The added gradient gate excludes the noisy supervision from pseudo masks for
dynamic online adaptation on target videos. We demonstrate empirically that
MDAL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on two datasets (including a

by the photochemistry of CO2 and H2O. Using a one-dimensional photochemical
model, we consider whether plausible volcanic gas fluxes could have switched
the redox-state of the past martian atmosphere to reducing conditions. In our
model, the total quantity and proportions of volcanic gases depend on the water
content, outgassing pressure, and oxygen fugacity of the source melt. We find
that with reasonable melt parameters the past martian atmosphere (~3.5 Gyr to
present) could have easily reached reducing and anoxic conditions with modest
levels of volcanism, >0.14 km^3/yr, well within the range of prior estimates.
Counter-intuitively we also find that more reducing melts with lower oxygen
fugacity require greater amounts of volcanism to switch a paleo-atmosphere from
oxidizing to reducing. The reason is that sulfur is more stable in such melts
and lower absolute fluxes of sulfur-bearing gases more than compensate for
increases in the proportions of H2 and CO. These results imply that ancient
Mars should have experienced periods with anoxic and reducing atmospheres even
through the mid-Amazonian whenever volcanic outgassing was sustained at
sufficient levels. Reducing anoxic conditions are potentially conducive to the
synthesis of prebiotic organic compounds, such as amino acids, and are
therefore relevant to the possibility of life on Mars. Also, anoxic reducing
conditions should have influenced the type of minerals that were formed on the
surface or deposited from the atmosphere such as elemental polysulfur (S8) as a
signature of past reducing atmospheres. Finally, our models allow us to
estimate the amount of volcanically sourced atmospheric sulfate deposited over
Mars' history, approximately 10^6 to 10^9 Tmol, with a spread depending on
assumed outgassing rate history and magmatic source conditions.

with an uncertainty set defined through a matrix induced norm is considered.
The worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization RAB
problem is formulated by decomposing the presumed covariance of the desired
signal into a product between a matrix and its Hermitian, and putting an error
term into the matrix and its Hermitian. In the literature, the norm of the
matrix errors often is the Frobenius norm in the maximization problem. Herein,
the closed-form optimal value for a minimization problem of the least-squares
residual over the matrix errors with an induced $l_{p,q}$-norm constraint is
first derived. Then, the worst-case SINR maximization problem is reformulated
into the maximization of the difference between an $l_2$-norm function and a
$l_q$-norm function, subject to a convex quadratic constraint. It is shown that
for any $q$ in the set of rational numbers greater than or equal to one, the
maximization problem can be approximated by a sequence of second-order cone
programming (SOCP) problems, with the ascent optimal values. The resultant
beamvector for some $q$ in the set, corresponding to the maximal actual array
output SINR, is treated as the best candidate such that the RAB design is
improved the most. In addition, a generalized RAB problem of maximizing the
difference between an $l_p$-norm function and an $l_q$-norm function subject to
the convex quadratic constraint is studied, and the actual array output SINR is
further enhanced by properly selecting $p$ and $q$. Simulation examples are
presented to demonstrate the improved performance of the robust beamformers for
certain matrix induced $l_{p,q}$-norms, in terms of the actual array output
SINR and the CPU-time for the sequential SOCP approximation algorithm.

dominated by BH lenses compared to stellar-mass lenses. Second, using a Markov

with offline vertices on one side, and with i.i.d.online vertices on the other
side. The offline vertices and the distribution of online vertices are known to
the algorithm beforehand. The realization of the online vertices, however, is
revealed one at a time, upon which the algorithm immediately decides how to
match it. For maximizing the cardinality of the matching, we give a
$0.711$-competitive online algorithm, which improves the best previous ratio of
$0.706$. When the offline vertices are weighted, we introduce a
$0.7009$-competitive online algorithm for maximizing the total weight of the
matched offline vertices, which improves the best previous ratio of $0.662$.
  Conceptually, we find that the analysis of online algorithms simplifies if
the online vertices follow a Poisson process, and establish an approximate
equivalence between this Poisson arrival model and online stochstic matching.
Technically, we propose a natural linear program for the Poisson arrival model,
and demonstrate how to exploit its structure by introducing a converse of
Jensen's inequality. Moreover, we design an algorithmic amortization to replace
the analytic one in previous work, and as a result get the first
vertex-weighted online stochastic matching algorithm that improves the results

However, FL generates excessive communication overheads between agents and a

proximal policy optimization (PPO)), this paper proposes two advanced
optimization schemes orienting to stochastic gradient descent (SGD): 1) A
decay-based scheme gradually decays the weights of a model's local gradients
with the progress of successive local updates, and 2) By representing the
agents as a graph, a consensus-based scheme studies the impact of exchanging a
model's local gradients among nearby agents from an algebraic connectivity

reformulates the mixup classification into two sub-tasks (i.e., mixed sample
generation and mixup classification) with corresponding sub-networks and solves
them in a bi-level optimization framework. For the generation, a learnable
lightweight mixup generator, Mix Block, is designed to generate mixed samples
by modeling patch-wise relationships under the direct supervision of the
corresponding mixed labels. To prevent the degradation and instability of
bi-level optimization, we further introduce a momentum pipeline to train
AutoMix in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on nine image benchmarks
prove the superiority of AutoMix compared with state-of-the-art in various
classification scenarios and downstream tasks.

labeling problem, assuming that all parts of training shapes are annotated with

fine-grained segmentation. Although most off-the-shelf CAD models are, by
construction, composed of fine-grained parts, they usually miss semantic tags

sampled 3D shapes, we model the clustering priors of points with a similarity
matrix and achieve part segmentation through minimizing a novel low rank loss.
To handle highly densely sampled point sets, we adopt a divide-and-conquer
strategy. We partition the large point set into a number of blocks. Each block
is segmented using a deep-clustering-based part prior network trained in a
category-agnostic manner. We then train a graph convolution network to merge
the segments of all blocks to form the final segmentation result. Our method is
evaluated with a challenging benchmark of fine-grained segmentation, showing

generating reasoned additional context which facilitates the successful
application of its heuristic. We explore different ways of generating

performance varies with the specific problem characteristics (such as problem

phase approximation (RPA) method for the spin-SU(2)-symmetry-broken case that
includes mixtures of ladder and bubble diagrams, beyond a SU(2)-symmetric case.
Within this approach, the relations between the tendency towards magnetic order
and the band structure tilt parameter $\gamma$ under different temperatures are
explored. The critical interaction strength $U_c$ for magnetic ordering
decreases as the tilt term changes from type-I Weyl semimetals to type-II. The
lower temperature, the sharper is the drop in $U_c$ at the critical point
between them. The variation of $U_c$ with a slight doping near half-filling is
also studied. It is generally found that these Weyl systems show a strongly
anisotropic spin response with an enhanced doubly degenerate transverse
susceptibility perpendicular to tilt direction, inherited from
$\mathcal{C}_{4z}$ rational symmetry of bare Hamiltonian, but with the
longitudinal response suppressed with respect to that. For small tilts $\gamma$
and strong enough interaction, we find two degenerate ordering patterns with
spin order orthogonal to the tilt direction but much shorter spin correlation
length parallel to the spin direction. With increasing the tilt, the system
develops instabilities with respect to in-plane magnetic orders with wavevector
$(0,\pi, q_z)$ and $(\pi,0, q_z)$, with $q_z$ increasing from 0 to $\pi$ before
the transition to a type-II Weyl semimetal is reached. These results indicate a
greater richness of magnetic phases in correlated Weyl semimetals that also

  Alignment and Category-Center Regularization","Accepted to appear in CVPR2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation is a
fundamental yet promising task relieving the need for laborious annotation
works. However, the domain shifts/discrepancies problem in this task compromise
the final segmentation performance. Based on our observation, the main causes
of the domain shifts are differences in imaging conditions, called image-level
domain shifts, and differences in object category configurations called
category-level domain shifts. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA pipeline
that unifies image-level alignment and category-level feature distribution
regularization in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, on the coarse side, we
propose a photometric alignment module that aligns an image in the source
domain with a reference image from the target domain using a set of image-level
operators; on the fine side, we propose a category-oriented triplet loss that
imposes a soft constraint to regularize category centers in the source domain
and a self-supervised consistency regularization method in the target domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed pipeline improves the
generalization capability of the final segmentation model and significantly
outperforms all previous state-of-the-arts.

In this paper, we present cuSpAMM, the first parallel SpAMM algorithm optimized

developed for light field reconstruction from a sparse set of views. We
indicate that the reconstruction can be efficiently modeled as angular
restoration on an epipolar plane image (EPI). The main problem in direct
reconstruction on the EPI involves an information asymmetry between the spatial
and angular dimensions, where the detailed portion in the angular dimensions is
damaged by undersampling. Directly upsampling or super-resolving the light
field in the angular dimensions causes ghosting effects. To suppress these
ghosting effects, we contribute a novel ""blur-restoration-deblur"" framework.
First, the ""blur"" step is applied to extract the low-frequency components of
the light field in the spatial dimensions by convolving each EPI slice with a
selected blur kernel. Then, the ""restoration"" step is implemented by a CNN,
which is trained to restore the angular details of the EPI. Finally, we use a
non-blind ""deblur"" operation to recover the spatial high frequencies suppressed
by the EPI blur. We evaluate our approach on several datasets, including
synthetic scenes, real-world scenes and challenging microscope light field
data. We demonstrate the high performance and robustness of the proposed
framework compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. We further show extended
applications, including depth enhancement and interpolation for unstructured
input. More importantly, a novel rendering approach is presented by combining

More specifically, the encoder adopts some developed efficient asymmetric

computation, simple deconvolution is applied in the decoder to further reduce
the amount of parameters while still maintaining high segmentation accuracy.
Also, MSCFNet has branches with efficient attention modules from different
stages of the network to well capture multi-scale contextual information. Then
we combine them before the final classification to enhance the expression of
the features and improve the segmentation efficiency. Comprehensive experiments

the reaction-amplitude phase, many combinations of partial waves at neighboring
energies in single-energy, single-channel partial wave analysis reproduce
experimental data identically, but are discontinuous and disconnected. To
obtain the continuous solution, the phase has to be fixed to some continuous
value. In the same reference it has also been shown that the change of angular
part of reaction-amplitude phase mixes partial waves, so the pole structure of
any single-energy single-channel partial wave analysis depends on the chosen
phase. As in any single-channel analysis the overall reaction-amplitude phase
cannot be determined because of continuum ambiguity, it is in principle free
and has to be taken from some coupled-channel model. Because of the difference
in the angular part of the phase, choosing different phases results in the
change of the pole content of the obtained solution. Therefore, single-energy
single-channel partial wave analysis is inherently model dependent, and the
number of poles it contains strongly depends on the choice of the phase. In
that reference these facts have been illustrated on the pseudo-scalar meson
production toy model. This truth is now for the measured observables
demonstrated on the realistic model of ref. [2] which combines amplitude and
partial wave analysis in one self-consistent scheme for the the world
collection of {\eta}-photoproduction data, and fixes the phase to BG2014-2
solution [3]. We show that the pole structure of the solution whose phase is
very close to the BG2014-2 theoretical ED phase is very similar to the pole
structure of BG2014-2 solution, but the agreement with the data is not ideal.
However, improving the agreement with the data requires the departure from

mathematical model, commonly written in terms of displacements and rotations
expressed in a fixed basis (Geometrically Exact Beam model, or GEB), has a
quasilinear governing system. However, the model may also be written in terms
of intrinsic variables expressed in a moving basis attached to the beam
(Intrinsic GEB model, or IGEB) and while the number of equations is then
doubled, the latter model has the advantage of being of first-order, hyperbolic
and only semilinear. First, for any network, we show the existence and
uniqueness of semi-global in time classical solutions to the IGEB model (i.e.,
for arbitrarily large time intervals, provided that the data are small enough).
Then, for a specific network containing a cycle, we address the problem of
local exact controllability of nodal profiles for the IGEB model -- we steer
the solution to satisfy given profiles at one of the multiple nodes by means of
controls applied at the simple nodes -- by using the constructive method of
Zhuang, Leugering and Li [Exact boundary controllability of nodal profile for

Afterwards, for any network, we show that the existence of a unique classical

optimization-based methods, such as constraint generation, are guaranteed to
provide an optimal solution if enough time is given, their use in online
applications remains a great challenge due to their usual excessive time
requirements. To alleviate their computational burden, some machine learning
techniques (ML) have been proposed in the literature, using the information
provided by previously solved MILP instances. Unfortunately, these techniques
report a non-negligible percentage of infeasible or suboptimal instances.
  By linking mathematical optimization and machine learning, this paper
proposes a novel approach that speeds up the traditional constraint generation
method, preserving feasibility and optimality guarantees. In particular, we
first identify offline the so-called invariant constraint set of past MILP
instances. We then train (also offline) a machine learning method to learn an
invariant constraint set as a function of the problem parameters of each
instance. Next, we predict online an invariant constraint set of the new unseen
MILP application and use it to initialize the constraint generation method.
This warm-started strategy significantly reduces the number of iterations to
reach optimality, and therefore, the computational burden to solve online each
MILP problem is significantly reduced. Very importantly, all the feasibility
and optimality theoretical guarantees of the traditional constraint generation
method are inherited by our proposed methodology. The computational performance
of the proposed approach is quantified through synthetic and real-life MILP

crystal, which was recently theoretically proposed and experimentally
demonstrated to be a topological insulator. At low temperature T and magnetic
field B, a series of Shubnikov-De Haas(SdH) oscillations are observed on the
magnetoresistivity (MR). The detailed analysis reveals a light cyclotron mass
of 0.1 me, and the field angle dependence of MR reveals that the SdH
oscillations originate from a convex Fermi surface. In the extreme quantum
limit (EQL) region, there is a metal-insulator transition occurring soon after
the EQL. We perform the scaling analysis, and all the isotherms fall onto a
universal scaling with a fitted critical exponent of 6.5. The enormous value of
critical exponent implies this insulating quantum phase originated from strong
electron-electron interactions in high fields. However, in the far end of EQL,
both the longitudinal and Hall resistivity increase exponentially with B, and
the temperature dependence of the MR reveals an energy gap induced by the high
magnetic field, signifying a magnetic freeze-out effect. Our findings indicate
that bulk beta-Bi4I4 is an excellent candidate for a 3D topological system for
exploring EQL physics and relevant exotic quantum phases.

Squeeze-and-Excite (SE) introduces a light-weight attention branch to enhance

Sigmoid function and multiplied by the feature map's trunk branch. It is too
sensitive to coordinate and balance the trunk and attention branches'
contributions. To control the attention branch's influence, we propose a new
attention method, called Shift-and-Balance (SB). Different from
Squeeze-and-Excite, the attention branch is regulated by the learned control

Experiments show that Shift-and-Balance attention significantly improves the
accuracy compared to Squeeze-and-Excite when applied in more layers, increasing
more size and capacity of a network. Moreover, Shift-and-Balance attention

theoretically studied in numerous works. Most approaches to this celebrated
many-body problem were restricted to the description of the tracer only, whose
essential properties, such as large deviation functions or two-time correlation
functions, were determined only recently. Here, we go beyond this standard
description by introducing and determining analytically generalised density

statistical properties of the tracer, these quantities fully characterise the
correlations between the tracer position and the bath particles density.
Considering the hydrodynamic limit of the problem, we unveil universal scaling
properties of the GDPs with space and time, and a non-monotonic dependence with
the distance to the tracer despite the absence of any asymmetry. Our analytical
approach provides exact results for the GDPs of paradigmatic models of
single-file diffusion, such as Brownian particles with hardcore repulsion, the
Symmetric Exclusion Process and the Random Average Process. The range of

These molecules have been chosen because they allow to extrapolate reliable
reference energies for very long chains, enabling an assessment of the energies
obtained by both methods for alkanes including up to 10 000 carbon atoms. We
find that both methods predict high-quality energies with the HDNN potentials

achievable using only a single sample from the distribution of each agent. A
notable portion of their results relies on reducing the design of single-sample
prophet inequalities (SSPIs) to that of order-oblivious secretary (OOS)
policies. The above reduction comes at the cost of not fully utilizing the
available samples. However, to date, this is essentially the only method for
proving SSPIs for many combinatorial sets. Very recently, Rubinstein et al.
[ITCS'20] give a surprisingly simple algorithm which achieves the optimal
competitive ratio for the single-choice SSPI problem $-$ a result which is
unobtainable going through the reduction to secretary problems. Motivated by
this discrepancy, we study the competitiveness of simple SSPI policies
directly, without appealing to results from OOS literature. In this direction,
we first develop a framework for analyzing policies against a greedy-like
prophet solution. Using this framework, we obtain the first SSPI for general
(non-bipartite) matching environments, as well as improved competitive ratios
for transversal and truncated partition matroids. Second, motivated by the
observation that many OOS policies for matroids decompose the problem into
independent rank-$1$ instances, we provide a meta-theorem which applies to any
matroid satisfying this partition property. Leveraging the recent results by
Rubinstein et al., we obtain improved competitive guarantees (most by a factor
of $2$) for a number of matroids captured by the reduction of Azar et al.
Finally, we discuss applications of our SSPIs to the design of mechanisms for
multi-dimensional limited information settings with improved revenue and
welfare guarantees.

finite-length circular cylinder rotating steadily perpendicularly to its
symmetry axis. The aspect ratio $\chi$, i.e. the ratio of the length of the
cylinder to its diameter, is varied from 1 to 15. In the creeping-flow regime,
we employ the slender-body theory to derive the expression of the torque up to
order 4 with respect to the small parameter $1/\ln(2\chi)$. Numerical results
agree well with the corresponding predictions for $\chi\gtrsim3$. We introduce
an \textit{ad hoc} modification in the theoretical prediction to fit the
numerical results obtained with shorter cylinders, and a second modification to
account for the increase of the torque resulting from finite inertial effects.
In strongly inertial regimes, a prominent wake pattern made of two pairs of
counter-rotating vortices takes place. Nevertheless the flow remains stationary
and exhibits two distinct symmetries, one of which implies that the
contributions to the torque arising from the two cylinder ends are identical.
We build separate empirical formulas for the contributions of pressure and
viscous stress to the torque provided by the lateral surface and the cylinder
ends. We show that, in each contribution, the dominant scaling law may be
inferred from simple physical arguments. This approach eventually results in an
empirical formula for the rotation-induced torque valid throughout the range of
inertial regimes and aspect ratios considered in the simulations.

cascade lasers (QCLs) have been intensively investigated during the last
decade. These studies have unveiled a rich phenomenology, owing to the unique
properties of these lasers, in particular their ultrafast gain medium. Thanks
to this, in QCLs a modulation of the intracavity field intensity gives rise to
a strong modulation of the population inversion, directly affecting the laser
current. In this work we show that this property can be used to study the
real-time dynamics of multimode THz QCLs, using a self-detection technique
combined with a 60GHz real-time oscilloscope. To demonstrate the potential of
this technique we investigate a free-running 4.2THz QCL, and observe a
self-starting periodic modulation of the laser current, producing trains of
regularly spaced, ~100ps-long pulses. Depending on the drive current we find
two regimes of oscillation with dramatically different properties: a first
regime at the fundamental repetition rate, characterised by large amplitude and
phase noise, with coherence times of a few tens of periods; a much more regular
second-harmonic-comb regime, with typical coherence times of ~105 oscillation
periods. We interpret these measurements using a set of effective semiconductor
Maxwell-Bloch equations that qualitatively reproduce the fundamental features
of the laser dynamics, indicating that the observed carrier-density and optical
pulses are in antiphase, and appear as a rather shallow modulation on top of a
continuous wave background. Thanks to its simplicity and versatility, the
demonstrated technique is a powerful tool for the study of ultrafast dynamics
in THz QCLs.

of the atmospheric evolution, we employ the own framework combining planetary
evolution in MESA with the realistic prescription of the escape of
hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. {We find that the final populations look
qualitatively similar in terms of the atmospheres survival around different

planets orbiting more massive stars. We show that a planet has larger chances
of keeping its primordial atmosphere in the habitable zone of a solar mass star

compact envelope.} We also address the problem of the uncertain initial
temperatures (luminosities) of planets and show that this issue is only of
particular importance for planets exposed to extreme atmospheric mass-losses.

for quasi-instant feedback is growing. Scientists want to use results from one
experiment to guide the selection of the next or even to improve the course of
a single experiment. Current HPC systems are typically batch-scheduled under
policies in which an arriving job is run immediately only if enough resources
are available; otherwise, it is queued. It is hard for these systems to support
real-time jobs. Real-time jobs, in order to meet their requirements, should
sometimes have to preempt batch jobs and/or be scheduled ahead of batch jobs
that were submitted earlier. Accommodating real-time jobs may negatively impact
system utilization also, especially when preemption/restart of batch jobs is
involved. We first explore several existing scheduling strategies to make
real-time jobs more likely to be scheduled in due time. We then rigorously
formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming for offline
scheduling and develop novel scheduling heuristics for online scheduling. We
perform simulation studies using trace logs of Mira, the IBM BG/Q system at

job performance for various percentages of real-time jobs in the workload. We
present new insights gained from grouping jobs into different categories based

just-in-time checkpointing combined with our heuristic can improve the
slowdowns of real-time jobs by 35% while limiting the increase of the slowdowns

We say that a

every $i\in \mathbb{N}$ there is $n_i\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for each $c\in

this paper we investigate the structure of order controllable subgroups. It is
proved that every order controllable, profinite, abelian group contains a
subset $\{g_n : n\in\N\}$ that topologically generates the group and whose
elements $g_n$ all have finite support. As a consequence, sufficient conditions
are obtained that allow us to encode, by means of a topological group
isomorphism, order controllable profinite abelian groups. Some applications of

researchers. However, most of the recently proposed deep learning-based methods
for OBB detection encounter the boundary discontinuity problem in angle or key
point regression. In order to alleviate this problem, researchers propose to
introduce some manually set parameters or extra network branches for
distinguishing the boundary cases, which make training more diffcult and lead
to performance degradation. In this paper, in order to solve the boundary
discontinuity problem in OBB regression, we propose to detect SAR ships by
learning polar encodings. The encoding scheme uses a group of vectors pointing
from the center of the ship target to the boundary points to represent an OBB.
The boundary discontinuity problem is avoided by training and inference
directly according to the polar encodings. In addition, we propose an Intersect
over Union (IOU) -weighted regression loss, which further guides the training
of polar encodings through the IOU metric and improves the detection
performance. Experiments on the Rotating SAR Ship Detection Dataset (RSSDD)
show that the proposed method can achieve better detection performance over
other comparison algorithms and other OBB encoding schemes, demonstrating the

efficient data lake requires a metadata system that addresses the many problems
arising when dealing with big data. In consequence, the study of data lake
metadata models is currently an active research topic and many proposals have
been made in this regard. However, existing metadata models are either tailored
for a specific use case or insufficiently generic to manage different types of
data lakes, including our previous model MEDAL. In this paper, we generalize
MEDAL's concepts in a new metadata model called goldMEDAL. Moreover, we compare
goldMEDAL with the most recent state-of-the-art metadata models aiming at
genericity and show that we can reproduce these metadata models with
goldMEDAL's concepts. As a proof of concept, we also illustrate that goldMEDAL
allows the design of various data lakes by presenting three different use
cases.

between two opponents where the winner is determined by its persistence. We
model a stand-off between a predator and a prey when the prey is hiding and the
predator is waiting for the prey to come out from its refuge, or when the two
are locked in a situation of mutual threat of injury or even death. The
stand-off is resolved when the predator gives up or when the prey tries to
escape. Instead of using the asymmetric war of attrition, we embed the
stand-off as an integral part of the predator-prey model of Rosenzweig and
MacArthur derived from first principles. We apply this model to study the
coevolution of the giving-up rates of the prey and the predator, using the
adaptive dynamics approach. We find that the long term evolutionary process
leads to three qualitatively different scenarios: the predator gives up
immediately, while the prey never gives up; the predator never gives up, while
the prey adopts any giving-up rate greater than or equal to a given positive
threshold value; the predator goes extinct. We observe that some results are
the same as for the asymmetric war of attrition, but others are quite
different.

Niyogi's extended version of a theorem by Blum and Blum (1975) on the existence
of locking data sets to prove a necessary condition for learnability in the

theorem as a special case. Moreover, when the language family is further
assumed to contain all finite languages, the same condition also becomes
sufficient for learnability in the limit.

the year 2006 at planetographic latitude 19N and persists since then after a
complex dynamic history, being possibly the third longest-lived oval in the
planet after Jupiter's Great Red Spot and oval BA. This anticyclone has
experienced close interactions with other ovals, merging with another oval in
February 2013; it has also experienced color changes, from white to red
(September 2013). The oval survived the effects of the closely located North
Temperate Belt Disturbance, which occurred in October 2016 and fully covered
the oval, rendering it unobservable for a short time. When it became visible
again at its expected longitude from its previous longitudinal track, it
reappeared as a white large oval keeping this color and the same morphology
since 2017 at least until the onset of the new convective disturbance in
Jupiter's North Temperate Belt in August 2020. Here we describe the historic
evolution of the properties of this oval. We use JunoCam and Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) images to measure its size and its internal rotation. We also
used HST and PlanetCam-UPV/EHU multi-wavelength observations to characterize
its color changes and Junocam images to unveil its detailed structure. The
color and the altitude-opacity indices show that the oval is higher and has
redder clouds than its environment but has lower cloud tops than other large
ovals like the GRS, and it is less red than the GRS and oval BA. We show that
in spite of the dramatic environmental changes suffered by the oval during all

enhances not only our baseline but also existing gaze estimation methods

languages with more or less redundancy. Generators that are uniform on the set
of expressions are not necessarily uniform on the set of regular languages.
Nevertheless, it is not straightforward that asymptotic estimates obtained by
considering the whole set of regular expressions are different from those
obtained using a more refined set that avoids some large class of equivalent
expressions. In this paper we study a set of expressions that avoid a given
absorbing pattern. It is shown that, although this set is significantly smaller
than the standard one, the asymptotic average estimates for the size of the
Glushkov automaton for these expressions does not differ from the standard
case.

a cavity. Modeling the polymer as a hard-sphere chain with a length up to N=601
monomers, we use a multiple-histogram method to measure the variation of the
conformational free energy of the polymer with respect to the number of
translocated monomers. The resulting free-energy functions are then used to
obtain the confinement free energy for the translocated portion of the polymer.
We characterize the confinement free energy for a flexible polymer in cavities
with constant cross-sectional area A for various cavity shapes (cylindrical,
rectangular and triangular) as well as for tapered cavities with pyramidal and
conical shape. The scaling of the free energy with cavity volume and
translocated polymer subchain length is generally consistent with predictions
from simple scaling arguments, with small deviations in the scaling exponents
likely due to finite-size effects. The confinement free energy depends strongly
on cavity shape anisometry and is a minimum for an isometric cavity shape with
a length/width ratio of unity. For translocation into infinitely long cones,
the scaling of the free energy with taper angle is consistent with a
theoretical prediction employing the blob model. We also examine the effects of
polymer bending rigidity on the translocation free energy for cylindrical
cavities. For isometric cavities, the observed scaling behaviour is in partial
agreement with theoretical predictions. In addition, translocation into highly
anisometric cylindrical cavities leads to a multi-stage folding process for
stiff polymers. Finally, we examine the effects of crowding agents inside the
cavity. We find that the confinement free energy increases with crowder
density. At constant packing fraction the magnitude of this effect lessens with
increasing crowder size for crowder/monomer size ratio$\geq$ 1.

damping is a promising way for the attenuation of vibration of these
electromechanical systems. It enables a compact vibration damping method
without adding significant mass and volumetric occupancy. Analyzing the
dynamics of such electromechanical systems requires precise modeling tools that
properly consider the coupling between the piezoelectric elements and the host

in the literature, most of the studies do not provide a formulation for
modeling the multiple piezoelectric patches that are scattered on the host
structure and shunted separately. This paper presents a methodology and a
formulation for separately shunted piezoelectric patches for achieving higher
performance on vibration attenuation. The Rayleigh-Ritz method is used for
performing modal analysis and obtaining the frequency response functions of the
electro-mechanical system. The developed model includes mass and stiffness
contribution of the piezoelectric patches as well as the electromechanical
coupling effect. In this study, the piezoelectric patches are shunted via
separate electrical circuits and compared with the ones those are shunted via
interconnected electrical circuits. For verification, system-level finite
element simulations are performed in ANSYS software and compared with the
analytical model results. An experimental setup is also built to validate the
performance of the separately shunted piezoelectric patches. The effectiveness
of the method is investigated for a broader range of frequencies and it was

his/her behaviour is modeled by a parametric preference function. To
efficiently learn the preferences and reduce search space quickly, we propose
the agent that interacts with the user to collect the most informative data for

user rates them based on his/her preference function. We show that the optimum

Compact stellarators are promising candidates for costreduction, but introduce
new difficulties: confinement in smaller volumes requires higher magnetic

Laplace forces on the coils-if everything else remains the same. This motivates
the inclusion of force reduction in stellarator coil optimization. In the

natural and rigorous way to define the Laplace force (despite the magnetic
field discontinuity across the current-sheet), we provide examples of cost
associated (peak force, surface-integral of the force squared) and discuss easy
generalizations to parallel and normal force-components, as these will be
subject to different engineering constraints. Such costs can then be easily

systems (GNSSs) for high-precision orbit determination and space-based
end-to-end telemetry telecommand control and communications. Due to limited
onboard ISL terminals, the polling time division duplex (PTDD) mechanism is
usually proposed for space link layer networking. By extending the polling
mechanism to ground-satellite links (GSLs), a unified management system of the
space segment and the ground segment can be realized. However, under the
polling system how to jointly design the topology of ISLs and GSLs during every
slot to improve data interaction has not been studied. In this paper, we
formulate the topology design problem as an integer linear programming, aiming
at minimizing the average delay of data delivery from satellites to ground
stations while satisfying the ranging requirement for the orbit determination.
To tackle the computational complexity problem, we first present a novel
modeling method of delay to reduce the number of decision variables. Further,
we propose a more efficient heuristic based on maximum weight matching
algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
methods for practical operation in GNSSs. Comparing the two methods, the
heuristic can achieve similar performance with respect to average delay but
with significantly less complexity.

been investigated for imaging the extracranial course of the facial nerve.
However, nerve visibility can be inconsistent with these sequences and may
depend on the composition of the parotid gland, limiting consistent
identification. To address this, we describe and evaluate a 'negative-contrast'
method for imaging of the extracranial facial nerve using three-dimensional
variable flip angle turbo spin echo (VFA-TSE) imaging. We investigate
strategies for further optimization, including parotid-specific VFA-TSE
optimization and the use of gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA). Materials
and Methods: 6 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with parotid tumors underwent
VFA-TSE and double echo steady state (DESS) imaging of the extracranial facial
nerve at 3T. The main trunk, divisions and branches of the extracranial facial
nerve were manually segmented by three radiologists, enabling CNR and Hausdorff
distance computation and confidence scoring. CNR, Hausdorff distance and
confidence scores were compared between sequences and between pre- and
post-contrast imaging to evaluate the effect of GBCA. Results: CNR, Hausdorff
distances and confidence scores were superior for VFA-TSE compared to DESS
imaging. GBCA administration produced a further increase in CNR of nerve
against parotid and improved differentiation of nerve from tumor. Conclusion:
Imaging of the extracranial facial nerve with VFA-TSE depicts the nerve as a
low signal structure ('black nerve') against the high signal parotid parenchyma
('white parotid') and outperforms positive-contrast DESS imaging in terms of
CNR, segmentation consistency and confidence. GBCA further increases negative
contrast and improves differentiation of nerve from tumor.

a singular elastic stress and self-similar crease morphologies. However, these

contact line pinning, in a way that resembles wetting of liquids on imperfect
solids. Contact line pinning is therefore a key element of creasing: it
inhibits complete unfolding and gives soft surfaces a folding memory.

experiments with superconducting and magnetic STM tips have been used to
uniquely distinguish them from trivial edge modes. Beyond the atomic chains,
STM has also uncovered signatures of MZM in two-dimensional materials and

algorithm called Approximate Amplitude Encoding that can effectively load all
the components of a given real-valued data vector into the amplitude of quantum
state, while the previous proposal can only load the absolute values of those
components. The key of our algorithm is to variationally train a shallow
parameterized quantum circuit, using the results of two types of measurement;
the standard computational-basis measurement plus the measurement in the
Hadamard-transformed basis, introduced in order to handle the sign of the data
components. The variational algorithm changes the circuit parameters so as to
minimize the sum of two costs corresponding to those two measurement basis,
both of which are given by the efficiently-computable maximum mean discrepancy.
We also consider the problem of constructing the singular value decomposition
entropy via the stock market dataset to give a financial market indicator; a
quantum algorithm (the variational singular value decomposition algorithm) is
known to produce a solution faster than classical, which yet requires the
sign-dependent amplitude encoding. We demonstrate, with an in-depth numerical
analysis, that our algorithm realizes loading of time-series of real stock
prices on quantum state with small approximation error, and thereby it enables
constructing an indicator of the financial market based on the stock prices.

signature of a secondary CDW with lambda = 6b associated with a putative
pair-density wave. These results shed light on universal aspects of the cuprate
CDW. In particular, its spatial profile appears to generically result from the
interplay between an incommensurate tendency at long length scales, possibly
related to properties of the Fermi surface, and local commensuration effects,
due to electron-electron interactions or lock-in to the lattice.

to the wireless broadcasting nature and the energy constraint of physical

jamming based physical layer security. With the help of a cooperative jammer,
existing solutions can effectively fight against eavesdroppers. However, these
schemes are of high energy cost due to continuously transmitting jamming
signals. To reduce the energy consumption, we propose a new idea of
intermittent jamming and design five specific intermittent jamming schemes
(IJSs). By taking the transmit frame formate into account, we optimize these
IJSs from three aspects, including the jamming power, the jamming method, and
the jamming positions. Then we analyze the applicability of the proposed IJSs
according to different requirements on the synchronization, the available
jamming energy and the jamming power constraints. Extensive MATLAB experiments
are conducted on the basis of the WLAN Toolbox, which demonstrate the proposed
IJSs can effectively degrade the reception of the eavesdropper and outperform
the widespread continuous jamming scheme (CJS) when the available jamming

deep learning models to detect playing techniques. In this paper, we propose a
transfer learning approach for the detection of sustain-pedal techniques, which
are commonly used by pianists to enrich the sound. In the source task, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained for learning spectral and

experimented through exploiting the knowledge of piano acoustics and physics.
This can achieve an accuracy score of 0.98 in the validation results. In the

to detect the sustain pedal in acoustic piano recordings. A concatenated

extracted from the recordings and classified into frame-wise pedal press or

parameter, the velocity polarization, measuring the global alignment of the
particles' velocities along the tangential direction of the ring. We also
measure the spatial velocity correlation function and its correlation length to
characterize the two states. In the rotating phase, the velocity correlation
displays an algebraic decay that is analytically predicted together with its
correlation length while in the stuck regime the velocity correlation decays
exponentially with a correlation length that increases with the persistence
time. In the first case, the correlation (and, in particular, its correlation
length) does not depend on the active force but the system size only. The
global collective motion, an effect caused by the interplay between
finite-size, periodicity, and persistent active forces, disappears as the size

especially in long-term dynamic urban scenarios. Due to the generality and
long-term stability, the pole-like objects are very suitable as landmarks for
unmanned vehicle localization in time-varing scenarios. In this paper, a
long-term LiDAR-only localization algorithm based on semantic cluster map is
proposed. At first, the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is used to infer the
semantics of LiDAR point clouds. Combined with the point cloud segmentation,
the long-term static objects pole/trunk in the scene are extracted and
registered into a semantic cluster map. When the unmanned vehicle re-enters the
environment again, the relocalization is completed by matching the clusters of
the local map with the clusters of the global map. Furthermore, the continuous
matching between the local and global maps stably outputs the global pose at
2Hz to correct the drift of the 3D LiDAR odometry. The proposed approach
realizes localization in the long-term scenarios without maintaining the
high-precision point cloud map. The experimental results on our campus dataset

Recent supervised approaches have boosted the face clustering accuracy greatly,
however their performance is still far from satisfactory. These methods can be
roughly divided into global-based and local-based ones. Global-based methods
suffer from the limitation of training data scale, while local-based ones are
difficult to grasp the whole graph structure information and usually take a
long time for inference. Previous approaches fail to tackle these two
challenges simultaneously. To address the dilemma of large-scale training and
efficient inference, we propose the STructure-AwaRe Face Clustering (STAR-FC)
method. Specifically, we design a structure-preserved subgraph sampling
strategy to explore the power of large-scale training data, which can increase
the training data scale from ${10^{5}}$ to ${10^{7}}$. During inference, the
STAR-FC performs efficient full-graph clustering with two steps: graph parsing
and graph refinement. And the concept of node intimacy is introduced in the
second step to mine the local structural information. The STAR-FC gets 91.97
pairwise F-score on partial MS1M within 310s which surpasses the
state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we are the first to train on very large-scale
graph with 20M nodes, and achieve superior inference results on 12M testing
data. Overall, as a simple and effective method, the proposed STAR-FC provides
a strong baseline for large-scale face clustering. Code is available at

for the eigenvalue equation equivalent to that for the Hydrogen atom, and the

  for Survival Data from an Ongoing Trial","12 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The European Medicines Agency has in recent years allowed licensing of new
pharmaceuticals at an earlier stage in the clinical trial process. When trial
evidence is obtained at an early stage, the events of interest, such as disease
progression or death, may have only been observed in a small proportion of
patients. Health care authorities therefore must decide on the adoption of new
technologies based on less mature evidence than previously, resulting in
greater uncertainty about clinical- and cost-effectiveness. When a trial is
ongoing at the point of decision making, there may be value in continuing the
trial in order to collect additional data before making an adoption decision.
This can be quantified by the Expected Value of Sample Information (EVSI).
However, no guidance exists on how to compute the EVSI for survival data from
an ongoing trial, nor on how to account for uncertainty about the choice of
survival model in the EVSI calculations. In this article, we describe
algorithms for computing the EVSI of extending a trial's follow-up, both where
a single known survival model is assumed, and where we are uncertain about the
true survival model. We compare a nested Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure
with a non-parametric regression-based method in two synthetic case studies,
and find close agreement between the two methods. The regression-based method
is fast and straightforward to implement, and scales easily to include any
number of candidate survival models in the model uncertainty case. EVSI for
ongoing trials can help decision makers determine whether early patient access
to a new technology can be justified on the basis of the current evidence or
whether more mature evidence is needed.

here as the ratio between a fixed high percentile of the CO distribution and a
fixed reference level in each bin. This reference level captures the level of
the faint CO floor that extends between bright filamentary features, while the
intensity level of the higher percentile probes the structures visually
associated with bright, dense ISM features like spiral arms, bars, and
filaments. We compare these contrasts to matched percentile-based measurements
of the 3.6 $\mu$m emission measured using Spitzer/IRAC imaging, which trace the
underlying stellar mass density. We find that the logarithms of CO contrasts on
150 pc scales are 3-4 times larger than, and positively correlated with, the
logarithms of 3.6 $\mu$m contrasts probing smooth non-axisymmetric stellar bar
and spiral structures. The correlation appears steeper than linear, consistent
with the compression of gas as it flows supersonically in response to
large-scale stellar structures, even in the presence of weak or flocculent
spiral arms. Stellar dynamical features appear to play an important role in
setting the cloud-scale gas density in our galaxies, with gas self-gravity

of universality in terms of the s-wave scattering length is identified by
comparing results for hard-disk and for soft-disk potentials. In the large
imbalance regime, the equation of state turns out to be well described by a
Landau-Pomeranchuk functional for two-dimensional polarons. To fully
characterize this expansion, we determine the polarons' effective mass and
their coupling parameter, complementing previous studies on their chemical
potential. Furthermore, we extract the magnetic susceptibility from
low-imbalance data, finding only small deviations from the mean-field
prediction. While the mean-field theory predicts a direct transition from a
paramagnetic to a fully ferromagnetic phase, our diffusion Monte Carlo results
suggest that the partially ferromagnetic phase is stable in a narrow interval

back-propagates gradients of neural predictors to directly update architecture
codes along the desired gradient directions to solve various tasks. In this
way, optimal architecture configurations can be found by NCP in our large

  Unlike prior arts of NAS that typically focus on a single task, NCP has
several unique benefits. (1) NCP transforms architecture optimization from
data-driven to architecture-driven, enabling joint search an architecture among
multitasks with different data distributions. (2) NCP learns from network codes

Y$_3$Cu$_9$(OH)$_{18}$[Cl$_8$(OH)], which has recently been proposed to feature
a spin-liquid ground state arising from a spatially anisotropic kagome lattice.
Our findings are based on a combination of bulk susceptibility, specific heat,
and magnetic torque measurements that disclose a N\'eel transition temperature
of $T_N=11$~K in this material, which might feature a coexistence of magnetic
order and persistent spin dynamics as previously found in
YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$. Contrary to previous studies of single crystals and
powders containing impurity inclusions, we use high-purity single crystals of
Y$_3$Cu$_9$(OH)$_{18}$[Cl$_8$(OH)] grown via an optimized hydrothermal
synthesis route that minimizes such inclusions. This study thus demonstrates
that the lack of magnetic ordering in less pure samples of the investigated
compound does not originate from the reduced symmetry of spin lattice but is
instead of extrinsic origin.

through an intermediate system, which modifies the characteristics of this
influence. Here we first show that this problem is elegantly solved by a
transform, which we call the Vernon transform, mapping influence action kernels
on influence action kernels. We also show that the Vernon transform takes a
particularly simple form in the Fourier domain, though it then must be
interpreted with some care. Second, leveraging results in quantum

water purification, and for the challenge of understanding how they change the
properties of confined liquids. Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamics
simulations to investigate water confined in an open graphene slit-pore as a
function of its width $w$, down to sub-nm scale. We find that the water
translational and rotational dynamics exhibits an oscillatory dependence on
$w$, due to water layering. The oscillations in dynamics correlate with those
in hydration pressure, which can be negative (hydrophobic attraction), or as
high as $\sim 1$ GPa, as seen in the experiments. At pore widths commensurable
with full layers (around $7.0$ \AA\ and $9.5$ \AA\ for one and two layers,
respectively), the free energy of the system has minima, and the hydration
pressure vanishes. These are the separations at which the dynamics of confined
water slows down. Nevertheless, the hydration pressure vanishes also where the
free energy has maxima, i.e., for those pore-widths which are incommensurable
with the formation of well-separated layers, as $w\simeq 8.0$ \AA. Around these
values of $w$, the dynamics is faster than in bulk, with water squeezed out
from the pore. This behavior has not been observed for simple liquids under
confinement, either for water in closed nano-pores. The decomposition of the
free energy clarifies the origins of the dynamics speedups and slowdowns. In
particular, we find that the nature of the slowdown depends on the number of
water layers: for two layers, it is due to the internal energy contribution, as
in simple liquids, while for one layer, it has an entropic origin possibly due
to the existence of a hydrogen-bond network in water. Our results shed light on
the mechanisms ruling the dynamics and thermodynamics of confined water and are
a guide for future experiments.

getting increasing attention in the recent past due to the fact that it has
high contrast, high penetrability, and has capability of retrieving high
resolution. Model-based regularized reconstruction methods used in PAT plays a
crucial role in the applicability of PAT because such methods can yield high
quality images from measurements obtained using fewer number of transducers. A
crucial factor that determines the quality of reconstruction in such methods is
the choice of regularization weight. Unfortunately, an appropriately tuned
value of regularization weight varies significantly with variation in the noise
level, as well as, with the variation in the high resolution contents of the
image, in a way that has not been well understood. There has been attempts to
determine optimum regularization weight from the measured data in the context
of using elementary and general purpose regularizations. In this paper, we
develop a practicable method for semi-automated tuning of the regularization
weight in the context of using a modern type of regularization that is
specifically designed for PAT image reconstruction. As a first step, we
introduce a relative smoothness constraint with a parameter; this parameter
computationally maps into the actual regularization weight, but, its tuning
does not vary significantly with variation in the noise level, and with the
variation in the high resolution contents of the image. Next, we construct an
algorithm that integrates the task of determining this mapping along with
obtaining the reconstruction. Finally we demonstrate experimentally that we can
run this algorithm with a nominal value of the relative smoothness parameter --
a value independent of the noise level and the structure of the underlying
image -- to obtain good quality reconstructions.

in practice today. Estimators are often shown extra obsolete requirements
together with the real ones to be implemented. Only one previous study has been
conducted on if such practices bias the estimations. Objective: We conducted
six experiments with both students and practitioners to study, and quantify,
the effects of obsolete requirements on software estimation. Method By
conducting a family of six experiments using both students and practitioners as
research subjects (N = 461), and by using a Bayesian Data Analysis approach, we
investigated different aspects of this effect. We also argue for, and show an
example of, how we by using a Bayesian approach can be more confident in our
results and enable further studies with small sample sizes. Results: We found
that the presence of obsolete requirements triggered an overestimation in
effort across all experiments. The effect, however, was smaller in a field
setting compared to using students as subjects. Still, the over-estimations
triggered by the obsolete requirements were systematically around twice the
percentage of the included obsolete ones, but with a large 95% credible
interval. Conclusions: The results have implications for both research and
practice in that the found systematic error should be accounted for in both
studies on software estimation and, maybe more importantly, in estimation
practices to avoid over-estimation due to this systematic error. We partly
explain this error to be stemming from the cognitive bias of
anchoring-and-adjustment, i.e. the obsolete requirements anchored a much larger
software. However, further studies are needed in order to accurately predict
this effect.

incorporate the learned experiences of other devices they encounter

structure factor of the Kitaev-Heisenberg-Gamma model through a variational
approach based on the exact fractionalized excitations of the pure Kitaev
honeycomb model. This novel approach reveals the physical reason for the
asymmetric stability of the Kitaev spin liquid phases around the ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic Kitaev limits. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
fractionalized excitations form bound states in specific regions of each Kitaev
spin liquid phase and that certain phase transitions induced by Heisenberg and
Gamma interactions are driven by the condensation of such a bound state.
Remarkably, this bound state appears as a sharp mode in the dynamical spin
structure factor, while its condensation patterns at the appropriate phase
transitions provide a simple explanation for the magnetically ordered phases
surrounding each Kitaev spin liquid phase.

common types of resources available for low-resourced and endangered languages

present a method for constructing word embeddings for endangered languages
using existing word embeddings of different resource-rich languages and the
translation dictionaries of resource-poor languages. Thereafter, the embeddings
are fine-tuned using the sentences in the universal dependencies and aligned to
match the semantic spaces of the big languages; resulting in cross-lingual
embeddings. The endangered languages we work with here are Erzya, Moksha,
Komi-Zyrian and Skolt Sami. Furthermore, we build a universal sentiment
analysis model for all the languages that are part of this study, whether
endangered or not, by utilizing cross-lingual word embeddings. The evaluation
conducted shows that our word embeddings for endangered languages are
well-aligned with the resource-rich languages, and they are suitable for
training task-specific models as demonstrated by our sentiment analysis model
which achieved a high accuracy. All our cross-lingual word embeddings and the

  Guarantee",,,,,"eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper considers the linear-quadratic dual control problem where the
system parameters need to be identified and the control objective needs to be
optimized in the meantime. Contrary to existing works on data-driven
linear-quadratic regulation, which typically provide error or regret bounds
within a certain probability, we propose an online algorithm that guarantees
the asymptotic optimality of the controller in the almost sure sense. Our dual
control strategy consists of two parts: a switched controller with
time-decaying exploration noise and Markov parameter inference based on the
cross-correlation between the exploration noise and system output. Central to
the almost sure performance guarantee is a safe switched control strategy that
falls back to a known conservative but stable controller when the actual state
deviates significantly from the target state. We prove that this switching
strategy rules out any potential destabilizing controllers from being applied,
while the performance gap between our switching strategy and the optimal linear
state feedback is exponentially small. Under our dual control scheme, the
parameter inference error scales as $O(T^{-1/4+\epsilon})$, while the
suboptimality gap of control performance scales as $O(T^{-1/2+\epsilon})$,
where $T$ is the number of time steps, and $\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small
positive number. Simulation results on an industrial process example are
provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.

contrast in texture, brightness and colors. Recent deep-learning-based works
reveal that it is effective to leverage boundaries for transparent object
detection (TOD). However, these methods usually encounter boundary-related
imbalance problem, leading to limited generation capability. Detailly, a kind
of boundaries in the background, which share the same characteristics with
boundaries of transparent objects but have much smaller amounts, usually hurt
the performance. To conquer the boundary-related imbalance problem, we propose
a novel content-dependent data augmentation method termed FakeMix. Considering
collecting these trouble-maker boundaries in the background is hard without
corresponding annotations, we elaborately generate them by appending the
boundaries of transparent objects from other samples into the current image
during training, which adjusts the data space and improves the generalization
of the models. Further, we present AdaptiveASPP, an enhanced version of ASPP,
that can capture multi-scale and cross-modality features dynamically. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our methods clearly outperform the
state-of-the-art methods. We also show that our approach can also transfer well
on related tasks, in which the model meets similar troubles, such as mirror
detection, glass detection, and camouflaged object detection. Code will be made

solid-state physics. In this paper, we present a theory of the nontrivial
interband effect, which cannot be removed without breaking given rules. We
define the general nontrivial interband effect by regarding a property of the
set of the total bands of a tight-binding Hamiltonian as the triviality. As
examples of the source of the nontrivial interband effect, we consider several
topological concepts: stable topological insulator, symmetry-based indicator,
fragile topological insulator, and multipole/higher-order topological
insulator. As an application, we calculate the orbital magnetic susceptibility
for tight-binding Hamiltonians with topological properties. In addition, we
consider the mechanical properties induced by the nontrivial interband effect.
We define interband-induced degeneracy pressure, which tends to take a negative
value, and calculate it for the Chern insulator. This calculation demonstrates
the importance of topological band structures in mechanical properties of
solids. We also discuss the application to nonlinear optics characterized by
the polarization difference and the generalization to interacting systems with
entanglement. The framework of the nontrivial interband effect, which includes
topological concepts as subsets, might be useful for finding unexplored
concepts.

proposed to compensate for contrast variation in MR images. Current
harmonization approaches either require cross-site traveling subjects for
supervised training or heavily rely on site-specific harmonization models to
encourage harmonization accuracy. These requirements potentially limit the
application of current harmonization methods in large-scale multi-site studies.
In this work, we propose an unsupervised MR harmonization framework, CALAMITI
(Contrast Anatomy Learning and Analysis for MR Intensity Translation and
Integration), based on information bottleneck theory. CALAMITI learns a
disentangled latent space using a unified structure for multi-site
harmonization without the need for traveling subjects. Our model is also able
to adapt itself to harmonize MR images from a new site with fine tuning solely
on images from the new site. Both qualitative and quantitative results show
that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with other
unsupervised harmonization approaches.

efficiently discovering high-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and improving

galaxy clusters with the Hubble Space Telescope spanning the redshift range
$z=1.13$ to $1.75$, discovering 57 likely transients and 27 likely SNe Ia at
$z\sim 0.8-2.3$. As in similar previous surveys (Dawson et al. 2009), this
proved to be a highly efficient use of HST for SN observations; the See Change
survey additionally tested the feasibility of maintaining, or further
increasing, the efficiency at yet higher redshifts, where we have less detailed
information on the expected cluster masses and star-formation rates. We find
that the resulting number of SNe Ia per orbit is a factor of $\sim 8$ higher
than for a field search, and 45% of our orbits contained an active SN Ia within
22 rest-frame days of peak, with one of the clusters by itself yielding 6 of
the SNe Ia. We present the survey design, pipeline, and SN discoveries. Novel

During crisis situations, institutions have struggled to return to the normal
track. The pandemic has drastically changed students behavior and family
preferences due to mental stress and the emotional life attached to it.
Consequently, it becomes a prerequisite, and emergencies need to examine the
choice characteristics influencing the selection of EI during the COVID19
pandemic situation.
  The purpose of this study is to critically examine institutional influence
and pandemic influence due to COVID19 that affects students choice about an
engineering institution (EI) and consequently to explore relationships between
institutional and pandemic influence. The findings of this quantitative
research, conducted through a self-reported survey, have revealed that
institutional and pandemic influence have governed EI choice under the COVID19

influence. The study demonstrated that EIs will have to reposition themselves
to normalize pandemic influence by tuning institutional characteristics that

shortening the forecasting horizon allows for more recent data and less

Usual statistical and machine learning models fail to provide good forecasts in

propose a novel evaluation criterion of lumpy and intermittent demand

However, there are still situations that automated vehicles cannot handle

necessary so that the driver takes control of the driving. Executing a ToC
requires the driver to get full situation awareness of the driving environment.
If the driver fails to get back the control in a limited time, a Minimum Risk
Maneuver (MRM) is executed to bring the vehicle into a safe state (e.g.,
decelerating to full stop). The execution of ToCs requires some time and can
cause traffic disruption and safety risks that increase if several vehicles
execute ToCs/MRMs at similar times and in the same area. This study proposes to
use novel C-ITS traffic management measures where the infrastructure exploits
V2X communications to assist Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) in the

validate the feasibility and quantify the benefits of the proposed

Lyapunov exponents fail to distinguish chaos when signal is mixed with noise.
This paper addresses the issue of segregating the dynamics in a rotor-stator
rub system when the vibrations are subjected to different levels of noise.
First, the limitation of 0-1 test in segregating chaos from signal mixed with
noise has been established. Second, the underexplored Benfords Law and its
application to the vibratory dynamical rotor-stator rub system has been
introduced for the first time. Using the Benfords Law Compliance Test (BLCT),
successful segregation of not only noise from chaos but also very low Signal to
Noise Ratio (SNR) signals which are mainly stochastic has been achieved. The
Euclidean Distance concept has been used to explore the scale-invariant
probability distribution of systems that comply with Benfords Law to separate
chaos from noise. Moreover, for moderate bands of noise in signals, we have
shown that the Schreibers Nonlinear Noise Reduction technique works effectively
in reducing the noise without damaging the dynamic properties of the system.
Combining these individual layers (0-1 Test, BLCT and Noise reduction) on a
rotor system, a Decision Tree based method to effectively segregate noise from
chaos and identify the correct dynamics of any system with time series data set
has been proposed.

orders of magnitude more likely. Finally, we briefly review a stochastic

the present paper we suggest a general framework to measure uncertainty of MST
identification. We study uncertainty in the framework of the concept of random
variable network (RVN). We consider different correlation based networks in the
large class of elliptical distributions. We show that true MST is the same in
three networks: Pearson correlation network, Fechner correlation network, and
Kendall correlation network. We argue that among different measures of
uncertainty the FDR (False Discovery Rate) is the most appropriated for MST
identification. We investigate FDR of Kruskal algorithm for MST identification
and show that reliability of MST identification is different in these three
networks. In particular, for Pearson correlation network the FDR essentially
depends on distribution of stock returns. We prove that for market network with
Fechner correlation the FDR is non sensitive to the assumption on stock's
return distribution. Some interesting phenomena are discovered for Kendall
correlation network. Our experiments show that FDR of Kruskal algorithm for MST
identification in Kendall correlation network weakly depend on distribution and
at the same time the value of FDR is almost the best in comparison with MST
identification in other networks. These facts are important in practical

for decades. Remarkable advances have been made recently; however, we are still
far from achieving this goal. In this paper, we focus on the scientific
discovery process where a high level of reasoning and remarkable
problem-solving ability are required. We review different machine learning
techniques used in scientific discovery with their limitations. We survey and
discuss the main principles driving the scientific discovery process. These
principles are used in different fields and by different scientists to solve
problems and discover new knowledge. We provide many examples of the use of
these principles in different fields such as physics, mathematics, and biology.
We also review AI systems that attempt to implement some of these principles.
We argue that building science discovery machines should be guided by these
principles as an alternative to the dominant approach of current AI systems
that focuses on narrow objectives. Building machines that fully incorporate
these principles in an automated way might open the doors for many
advancements.

  containment polices for epidemic diseases",,,,,"q-bio.PE cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Simulating the spread of infectious diseases in human communities is critical
for predicting the trajectory of an epidemic and verifying various policies to
control the devastating impacts of the outbreak. Many existing simulators are
based on compartment models that divide people into a few subsets and simulate
the dynamics among those subsets using hypothesized differential equations.
However, these models lack the requisite granularity to study the effect of
intelligent policies that influence every individual in a particular way. In
this work, we introduce a simulator software capable of modeling a population
structure and controlling the disease's propagation at an individualistic
level. In order to estimate the confidence of the conclusions drawn from the
simulator, we employ a comprehensive probabilistic approach where the entire
population is constructed as a hierarchical random variable. This approach
makes the inferred conclusions more robust against sampling artifacts and gives
confidence bounds for decisions based on the simulation results. To showcase
potential applications, the simulator parameters are set based on the formal
statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outcome of a wide range of control
measures is investigated. Furthermore, the simulator is used as the environment
of a reinforcement learning problem to find the optimal policies to control the
pandemic. The obtained experimental results indicate the simulator's
adaptability and capacity in making sound predictions and a successful policy
derivation example based on real-world data. As an exemplary application, our
results show that the proposed policy discovery method can lead to control
measures that produce significantly fewer infected individuals in the
population and protect the health system against saturation.

theory, and if no proper definition is to be found in the literature,
statistical properties of intermittency were studied and models were developed
in attempt to reproduce it. The first contribution of this work is to propose a
requirement list to be satisfied by models designed within the Lagrangian
framework. Multifractal stochastic processes are a natural choice to retrieve
multifractal properties of the dissipation. Among them, following the
proposition of \cite{Mandelbrot1968}, we investigate the Gaussian
Multiplicative Chaos formalism, which requires the construction of a
log-correlated stochastic process $X_t$. The fractional Gaussian noise of Hurst
parameter $H = 0$ is of great interest because it leads to a log-correlation
for the logarithm of the process.Inspired by the approximation of fractional
Brownian motion by an infinite weighted sum of correlated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
processes, our second contribution is to propose a new stochastic model: $X_t =
\int_0^\infty Y_t^x k(x) d x$, where $Y_t^x$ is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
with speed of mean reversion $x$ and $k$ is a kernel. A regularization of
$k(x)$ is required to ensure stationarity, finite variance and logarithmic
auto-correlation. A variety of regularizations are conceivable, and we show
that they lead to the aforementioned multifractal models.To simulate the
process, we eventually design a new approach relying on a limited number of
modes for approximating the integral through a quadrature $X_t^N = \sum_{i=1}^N
\omega_i Y_t^{x_i}$, using a conventional quadrature method. This method can
retrieve the expected behavior with only one mode per decade, making this
strategy versatile and computationally attractive for simulating such
processes, while remaining within the proposed framework for a proper
description of intermittency.

energy sources, consumer behavior and trading, need to be balanced to ensure
stable grid operation. Standard smart grid solutions to mitigate large
frequency excursions are based on centrally collecting data and give rise to
security and privacy concerns. Furthermore, control of fluctuations is often
tested by employing Gaussian perturbations. Here, we demonstrate that power
grid frequency fluctuations are in general non-Gaussian, implying that large
excursions are more likely than expected based on Gaussian modeling. We
consider real power grid frequency measurements from Continental Europe and
compare them to stochastic models and predictions based on Fokker-Planck
equations. Furthermore, we review a decentral smart grid control scheme to
limit these fluctuations. In particular, we derive a scaling law of how
decentralized control actions reduce the magnitude of frequency fluctuations
and demonstrate the power of these theoretical predictions using a test grid.
Overall, we find that decentral smart grid control may reduce grid frequency
excursions due to both Gaussian and non-Gaussian power fluctuations and thus
offers an alternative pathway for mitigating fluctuation-induced risks.

molecules. Cells copy sequence information from DNA to RNA and on into
proteins, which are the molecules responsible for the function and regulation
of cellular systems. In the templated copying process the template catalyses
the formation of a second molecule carrying the same sequence. Traditionally,
people have ignored the separation of the template and copy at the end of the
process, but separation is necessary and fundamentally changes the
thermodynamics of the process. In general, creating an accurate polymer costs
free energy. Omitting separation, this cost can be compensated for by the extra
free energy released by ""correct"" copy/template bonds. Separation requires
these bonds be broken, so true copying requires an input of free energy.
Equally the fact that copy/template bonds are temporary means there is no
thermodynamic bias towards accuracy, instead copying relies only on kinetic
effects to promote accuracy. In general, transducing energy can only happen
reversibly when the transduction process is quasistatic and time varying;
something that cannot be true when you are relying on kinetic discrimination.
  Copying is a far from equilibrium process. This thesis explores the
consequences of this observation. We start in the limit of infinite length
copies where the costs of accuracy represent hard thermodynamic bounds and then
moves to the finite length limit where these same limits can be understood as
kinetic barriers. We then discuss copying systems as non-equilibrium steady
states, which can be analysed as information engines moving free energy between
out-of-equilibrium baths.

environments due to blockage and distortion. Metasurface cloaks have been
explored in the quest of addressing this challenge by reducing antenna

overall scattering reduction. Here we introduce a different route towards
radio-transparent antennas, in which the cloak itself acts as the radiating

This feat is primarily attributed due to the seminal Transformer architecture,

large-size models have achieved unprecedented performances, they come at high
computational costs. Consequently, some of the recent NLP architectures have
utilized concepts of transfer learning, pruning, quantization, and knowledge
distillation to achieve moderate model sizes while keeping nearly similar
performances as achieved by their predecessors. Additionally, to mitigate the
data size challenge raised by language models from a knowledge extraction
perspective, Knowledge Retrievers have been built to extricate explicit data
documents from a large corpus of databases with greater efficiency and
accuracy. Recent research has also focused on superior inference by providing
efficient attention to longer input sequences. In this paper, we summarize and
