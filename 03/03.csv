nanocrystals having a preferred crystallographic orientation. On mesoscopic
length scales, the properties of mesocrystals are strongly affected by
structural heterogeneity. Here, we report the detailed structural
characterization of a faceted mesocrystal grain self-assembled from 60 nm sized
gold nanocubes. Using coherent X-ray diffraction imaging, we determined the
structure of the mesocrystal with the resolution sufficient to resolve each
gold nanoparticle. The reconstructed electron density of the gold mesocrystal
reveals its intrinsic structural heterogeneity, including local deviations of
lattice parameters, and the presence of internal defects. The strain
distribution shows that the average superlattice obtained by angular X-ray
cross-correlation analysis and the real, multidomain structure of a mesocrystal
are very close to each other, with a deviation less than 10 percent. These
results will provide an important impact to understanding of the fundamental
principles of structuring and self-assembly including ensuing properties of

scheme, which can solve the performance degradation problem caused by the
unique {\emph{triple delay-beam-Doppler squint effects}} of aeronautical
terahertz UM-MIMO channels. Specifically, based on the rough angle estimates
acquired from navigation information, an initial aeronautical link is
established, where the delay-beam squint at transceiver can be significantly
mitigated by employing a Grouping True-Time Delay Unit (GTTDU) module (e.g.,
the designed {\emph{Rotman lens}}-based GTTDU module). According to the
proposed prior-aided iterative angle estimation algorithm, azimuth/elevation
angles can be estimated, and these angles are adopted to achieve precise
beam-alignment and refine GTTDU module for further eliminating delay-beam
squint. Doppler shifts can be subsequently estimated using the proposed
prior-aided iterative Doppler shift estimation algorithm. On this basis, path
delays and channel gains can be estimated accurately, where the Doppler squint
can be effectively attenuated via compensation process. For data transmission,
a data-aided decision-directed based channel tracking algorithm is developed to
track the beam-aligned effective channels. When the data-aided channel tracking
is invalid, angles will be re-estimated at the pilot-aided channel tracking
stage with an equivalent sparse digital array, where angle ambiguity can be
resolved based on the previously estimated angles. The simulation results and
the derived Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds verify the effectiveness of our
solution.

less robust to missing DOAs from one of the arrays. The methods are
demonstrated with five IoT 8-microphone circular arrays, placed at unspecified

inhomogeneous distribution of element abundances at $T \sim 10^9$ K, but
subsequent element diffusion will tend to erase these inhomogeneities. We
calculate the cosmological comoving diffusion length for the BBN elements. This
diffusion length is limited by atomic scattering and is therefore dominated by
diffusion when the atoms are neutral, between the redshifts of recombination
and reionization. We find that the comoving diffusion length today is $d_{com}
\approx 70$ pc for all of the elements of interest except $^7$Li, for which
$d_{com}$ is an order of magnitude smaller because $^7$Li remains ionized
throughout the relevant epoch. This comoving diffusion length corresponds to a
substellar baryonic mass scale and is roughly equal to the horizon scale at
BBN. These results lend support to the possibility that inhomogeneities on
scales larger than the horizon at BBN could lead to a spatially inhomogeneous
distribution of elements today, while purely subhorizon fluctuations at BBN can
result only in a homogeneous element distribution at present.

only the trailing edge angle is varied from 45{\deg} (concave), 90{\deg}
(rectangular) to 135{\deg} (convex) while maintaining the constant area of the
flexible plate. We examine the impact of the frequency ratio f* defined as the
ratio of the natural frequency of the flexible plate to the actuated pitching
frequency. Through our numerical simulations, we find that the global maximum
mean thrust occurs near f*=1 corresponding to the resonance condition. However,
the optimal propulsive efficiency is achieved around f*=1.54 instead of the
resonance condition. While the convex plate with low and high bending stiffness
values shows the best performance, the rectangular plate with moderate bending
stiffness is the most efficient propulsion configuration. Through dynamic mode
decomposition, we find that the passive deformation can help in redistributing
the pressure gradient thus improving the efficiency and thrust production. A
momentum-based thrust evaluation approach is adopted to link the instantaneous
vortical structures with the time-dependent thrust. When the vortices detach
from the trailing edge, the instantaneous thrust shows the largest values due
to the strong momentum change and convection process. Moderate flexibility and
convex shape help transfer momentum to the fluid, thereby improving thrust
generation and promoting the transition from drag to thrust. The increase of
the trailing edge angle can broaden the range of flexibility that produces
positive mean thrust.

velocity of pulsars remains largely a mystery. The typical space velocities of
several hundred km/s have been attributed to ""kicks"" resulting from asymmetries
either in the supernova ejecta or in the neutrino emission. Observations have
shown a strong tendency for alignment of the pulsar space velocity and spin
axis in young pulsars but, up to now, these comparisons have been restricted to
two dimensions. We report here the first evidence for three-dimensional
alignment between the spin and velocity vectors, largely based on observations
made with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope of the
pulsar PSR~J0538+2817 and its associated supernova remnant S147. Analysis of
these and related observations has enabled us to determine the location of the
pulsar within the supernova remnant and hence its radial velocity. Current
simulations of supernova explosions have difficulty producing such
three-dimensional alignment. Our results, which depend on the unprecedented
sensitivity of the new observations, add another dimension to the intriguing
correlation between pulsar spin-axis and birth-kick directions, thus deepening
the mysteries surrounding the birth of neutron stars.

planning, but also because of the exponential growth in problem size as a
function of number of robots. Leveraging recent works obtaining a tractable
safety maximizing plan for a single robot, we propose a scalable two-stage

a low-level single-agent control problem and a high-level task allocation
problem. The low-level problem uses an efficient approximation of stochastic
reachability for a Markov decision process to derive the optimal control policy
under dynamic uncertainty. The task allocation is solved using polynomial-time
forward and reverse greedy heuristics and in a distributed auction-based

layer when a stably-stratified fluid with a composition gradient is cooled from
above. This configuration allows the study of zonal flows for a wide range of
values of the Rayleigh number, $Ra$, and aspect ratio of the convection zone
within a given simulation. We perform a series of 2D simulations using the
Boussinesq approximation, with aspect ratio of the computational domain between
$1$ and $5$, and Prandtl number $Pr = 0.1$, 0.5, 1, and $7$. We find that for
square domains zonal flows appear when the aspect ratio of the convective layer
is smaller than two, and the evolution of the system depends on the Prandtl
number. For $Pr\leq 1$, the fluid experiences bursts of convective transport
with negligible convective transport between bursts. The magnitude and
frequency of the bursts are smaller at low $Pr$, which suggests that the
bursting regime is stronger in a narrow range around $Pr=1$, as observed in
previous studies of thermal convection. For $Pr=7$, the structure of the flow
consists of tilted convective plumes, and the convective transport is sustained
at all times. In wider domains, the aspect ratio of the convective zone is
always much larger than two and zonal flows do not appear. These results
confirm and extend to fluids with stable composition gradients previous
findings on thermal convection. The fact that zonal flows can be avoided by
using computational domains with large aspect ratios opens up the possibility
of 2D studies of convective overshoot, layer formation and transport properties
across diffusive interfaces.

information about their practice. Blog posts therefore provide a potential
source of evidence for software engineering (SE) research. The use of blog
posts as evidence for research appears contentious amongst some SE researchers.
Objective: To better understand the actual and perceived value of blog posts as
evidence for SE research, and to develop guidance for SE researchers on the use
of blog posts as evidence. Method: We further analyse responses from a
previously conducted attitudinal survey of 44 software engineering researchers.
We conduct a heatmap analysis, simple statistical analysis, and a thematic
analysis. Results: We find no clear consensus from respondents on researchers'
attitudes to the credibility of blog posts, or on a standard set of criteria to
evaluate blog-post credibility. We show that some of the responses to the
survey exhibit characteristics similar to the content of blog posts, e.g.,
asserting prior beliefs as claims, with no citations and little supporting
rationale. We illustrate our insights with ~60 qualitative examples from the
survey ~40% of the total responses. We complement our quantitative and
qualitative analyses with preliminary checklists to guide SE researchers.
Conclusion: Blog posts are relevant to research because they are written by
software practitioners describing their practice and experience. But evaluating
the credibility of blog posts, so as to select the higher-quality content,
remains an ongoing challenge. The quantitative and qualitative results, with
the proposed checklists, are intended to stimulate reflection and action in the
research community on the role of blog posts as evidence in software
engineering research. Finally, our findings on researchers' attitudes to blog
posts also provide more general insights into researchers' values for SE
research.

  Fairness Regularizer",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning and reasoning over graphs is increasingly done by means of
probabilistic models, e.g. exponential random graph models, graph embedding
models, and graph neural networks. When graphs are modeling relations between
people, however, they will inevitably reflect biases, prejudices, and other
forms of inequity and inequality. An important challenge is thus to design
accurate graph modeling approaches while guaranteeing fairness according to the
specific notion of fairness that the problem requires. Yet, past work on the
topic remains scarce, is limited to debiasing specific graph modeling methods,
and often aims to ensure fairness in an indirect manner.
  We propose a generic approach applicable to most probabilistic graph modeling
approaches. Specifically, we first define the class of fair graph models
corresponding to a chosen set of fairness criteria. Given this, we propose a
fairness regularizer defined as the KL-divergence between the graph model and
its I-projection onto the set of fair models. We demonstrate that using this
fairness regularizer in combination with existing graph modeling approaches
efficiently trades-off fairness with accuracy, whereas the state-of-the-art
models can only make this trade-off for the fairness criterion that they were
specifically designed for.

small compact model through eliminating unimportant channels from a large

procedure from the original over-parameterized model, which is both tedious and
expensive especially when the pruning is aggressive. In this paper, we propose
a simple yet effective channel pruning technique, termed network Pruning via
rEsource rEalLocation (PEEL), to quickly produce a desired slim model with
negligible cost. Specifically, PEEL first constructs a predefined backbone and
then conducts resource reallocation on it to shift parameters from less
informative layers to more important layers in one round, thus amplifying the
positive effect of these informative layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of PEEL , we perform extensive experiments on ImageNet with ResNet-18,
ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-B0. Experimental
results show that structures uncovered by PEEL exhibit competitive performance
with state-of-the-art pruning algorithms under various pruning settings. Our

keep a mental map of both segmentation and delineation when performing manual
coastline detection. To take into account this task duality, we therefore
devise a new model to unite these two approaches in a deep learning model. By
taking inspiration from the main building blocks of a semantic segmentation
framework (UNet) and an edge detection framework (HED), both tasks are combined
in a natural way. Training is made efficient by employing deep supervision on
side predictions at multiple resolutions. Finally, a hierarchical attention
mechanism is introduced to adaptively merge these multiscale predictions into
the final model output. The advantages of this approach over other traditional
and deep learning-based methods for coastline detection are demonstrated on a
dataset of Sentinel-1 imagery covering parts of the Antarctic coast, where
coastline detection is notoriously difficult. An implementation of our method

attention in computer vision due to security concerns. We observe that
up-sampling is a necessary step of most face forgery techniques, and cumulative
up-sampling will result in obvious changes in the frequency domain, especially
in the phase spectrum. According to the property of natural images, the phase
spectrum preserves abundant frequency components that provide extra information
and complement the loss of the amplitude spectrum. To this end, we present a
novel Spatial-Phase Shallow Learning (SPSL) method, which combines spatial
image and phase spectrum to capture the up-sampling artifacts of face forgery
to improve the transferability, for face forgery detection. And we also
theoretically analyze the validity of utilizing the phase spectrum. Moreover,
we notice that local texture information is more crucial than high-level
semantic information for the face forgery detection task. So we reduce the
receptive fields by shallowing the network to suppress high-level features and
focus on the local region. Extensive experiments show that SPSL can achieve the
state-of-the-art performance on cross-datasets evaluation as well as
multi-class classification and obtain comparable results on single dataset

scalar, pseudoscalar and tensor new physics (NP) terms which strength is
governed by, complex in general, Wilson coefficients. We show that both in the
laboratory frame, where the initial hadron is at rest, and in the center of
mass of the two final leptons, a $\vec {\cal P}$ component perpendicular to the
plane defined by the three-momenta of the final hadron and the $\tau$ lepton is
only possible for complex Wilson coefficients, being a clear signal for physics
beyond the SM as well as time reversal (or CP-symmetry) violation. We make
specific evaluations of the different polarization vector components for the
$\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c$, $\bar B_c\to\eta_c,J/\psi$ and $\bar B\to D^{(*)}$

their meanings are discussed. The results of a one-year experimental

in the top than in the middle subcell. The spectral nature of soiling has
demonstrated to increase the annual spectral losses of around 2%. Ideal
conditions for the mitigation of soiling are also discussed and found to be in
blue-rich environments, where the higher light intensity at the shorter
wavelengths can limit the impact of soiling on the overall production of the

captured using a split Volume-of-Fluid method generalized for a
non-divergence-free liquid velocity and with mass exchange across the
interface. Mass conservation to machine-error precision is achieved in the
limit of incompressible liquid. This model is implemented for two-phase
mixtures at supercritical pressure but subcritical temperature conditions for
the liquid, as it is common in the early times of liquid hydrocarbon injection
under real-engine conditions. The dissolution of the gas species into the
liquid phase is enhanced, and vaporization or condensation can occur
simultaneously at different interface locations. Greater numerical challenges
appear compared to incompressible two-phase solvers that are successfully
addressed for the first time: (a) local thermodynamic phase equilibrium (LTE)
and jump conditions determine the interface solution (e.g., temperature,
composition, surface-tension coefficient); (b) a real-fluid thermodynamic model
is considered; and (c) phase-wise values for certain variables (e.g., velocity)

alleviated with a split pressure-gradient technique to solve the pressure
Poisson equation (PPE) for the low-Mach-number flow. Thus, a Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) method is implemented, directly solving the continuity
constraint without an iterative process. Various verification tests show the
accuracy and viability of the current approach. Then, the growth of surface
instabilities in a binary system composed of liquid n-decane and gaseous oxygen
at supercritical pressures for n-decane is analyzed. Other features of

shown, the non-Gaussianities are of the order $\mathcal{O}\sim(10^{-1})$.
Furthermore, the slow-roll indices and the observational indices of inflation,

systems. The recovery of initial information embedded locally in the system
from the scrambled quantum state is a fundamental concern in many contexts.
From a dynamical perspective, information recovery can measure dynamical
instability in quantum chaos, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and the black
hole information paradox. This article considers general aspects of quantum
information recovery when the scrambling dynamics have conservation laws due to
Lie group symmetries. Here, we establish fundamental limitations on the
information recovery from scrambling dynamics with arbitrary Lie group
symmetries. We show universal relations between information recovery, symmetry,
and quantum coherence, which apply to many physical situations. The relations
predict that the behavior of the Hayden-Preskill black hole model changes
qualitatively under the assumption of the energy conservation law.
Consequently, we can rigorously prove that under the energy conservation law,
the error of the information recovery from a small black hole remains
unignorably large until it completely evaporates. Moreover, even when the black
hole is very large, the recovery of information thrown into the black hole is
not completed until most of the black hole evaporates. The relations also
provide a unified view of the symmetry restrictions on quantum information

  Stems of homotopy groups correspond to charges of probe p-branes near black

Adams e-invariant sees the H3-charge lattice; vanishing Adams e-invariant
implies consistent global C3-fields; Conner-Floyd's e-invariant is H3-flux seen
in the Green-Schwarz mechanism; the Hopf invariant is the M2-brane Page charge

worldvolumes sourcing all these charges. Cobordism in the third stable stem

lift these unit H3-fluxes to heterotic M-theory with heterotic line bundles. In

evidence of a sharp rise, a peak around 4-5 days post-burst, followed by a
relatively steep decline. We provide two possible interpretations based on the
time at which the light curve reached its peak. (1) If the light curve peaks
earlier, the peak is produced by the synchrotron self-absorption frequency
moving through the radio band, resulting from the forward shock propagating
into a wind medium and (2) if the light curve peaks later, the turn over in the
light curve is caused by a jet break. In the former case, we find a minimum
equipartition energy of ~3x10^47 erg and bulk Lorentz factor of ~5, while in
the latter case we estimate the jet opening angle of ~9-16 degrees. Due to the
lack of data, it is impossible to determine which is the correct

overall performance. This is in contrast to prior works that rely purely on
random synthesizers. Furthermore, rather than completely commit to imitating,
we introduce task losses that penalize undesirable behaviors, such as
collision, off-road, and so on. Unlike prior works, this is done by introducing
a differentiable vehicle rasterizer that directly converts the waypoints output
by the network into images. This effectively avoids the usage of heavyweight
ConvLSTM networks, therefore, yields a faster model inference time. About the
network architecture, we exploit an attention mechanism that allows the network
to reason critical objects in the scene and produce better interpretable
attention heatmaps. To further enhance the safety and robustness of the
network, we add an optional optimization-based post-processing planner
improving the driving comfort. We comprehensively validate our method's

radiation on the orbital evolution of contact neutron-star-white-dwarf (NS-WD)
binaries, and the detectability of these binaries by space GW detectors (e.g.,
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, LISA; Taiji; Tianqin). A NS-WD binary
becomes contact when the WD component fills its Roche lobe, at which the GW
frequency ranges from ~0.0023 to 0.72 Hz for WD with masses ~0.05-1.4 Msun. We
find that some high-mass NS-WD binaries may undergo direct coalescence after
unstable mass transfer. However, the majority of NS-WD binaries can avoid
direct coalescence because mass transfer after contact can lead to a reversal
of the orbital evolution. Our model can well interpret the orbital evolution of
the ultra-compact X-ray source 4U 1820--30. For a 4-year observation of 4U
1820--30, the expected signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in GW characteristic strain
is ~11.0/10.4/2.2 (LISA/Taiji/Tianqin). The evolution of GW frequencies of
NS-WD binaries depends on the WD masses. NS-WD binaries with masses larger than
4U 1820--30 are expected to be detected with significantly larger SNRs. For a
(1.4+0.5) Msun NS-WD binary close to contact, the expected SNR for a one week
observation is ~27/40/28 (LISA/Taiji/Tianqin). For NS-WD binaries with masses
of (1.4+>~1.1) Msun, the significant change of GW frequencies and amplitudes
can be measured, and thus it is possible to determine the binary evolution

properties of our approach are that (i) the learned biases generalize to
different UWB anchor setups and (ii) the approach is computationally efficient

a Crazyflie nano-quadcopter. Experimental results show that the proposed
localization framework, relying only on the onboard IMU and UWB, provides an
average of 42.08 percent localization error reduction (in three different

Using a simple covering number argument, we establish that under quite mild

a small training error on polynomially many data necessarily has a

ratio $q_2 = 0.9$--$1.2 \times 10^{-5} = 3$--$4~q_{\oplus}$ at $1\sigma$, which
is the lowest mass-ratio microlensing planet to date. Together with two other
recent discoveries ($4 \lesssim q/q_\oplus \lesssim 6$), it fills out the
previous empty sector at the bottom of the triangular $(\log s, \log q)$
diagram, where $s$ is the planet-host separation in units of the angular
Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$. Hence, these discoveries call into question
the existence, or at least the strength, of the break in the mass-ratio
function that was previously suggested to account for the paucity of very
low-$q$ planets. Due to the extreme magnification of the event, $A_{\rm
max}\sim 1450$ for the underlying single-lens event, its light curve revealed a
second companion with $q_3 \sim 0.05$ and $|\log s_3| \sim 1$, i.e., a factor
$\sim 10$ closer to or farther from the host in projection. The measurements of
the microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$ and the angular Einstein radius
$\theta_{\rm E}$ allow estimates of the host, planet, and second companion
masses, $(M_1, M_2, M_3) \sim (0.3M_{\odot}, 1.0M_{\oplus}, 17M_{J})$, the
planet and second companion projected separations, $(a_{\perp,2}, a_{\perp,3})
\sim (1.5, 0.15~{\rm or}~15)$~au, and system distance $D_{\rm L} \sim 1$ kpc.
The lens could account for most or all of the blended light ($I \sim 19.3$) and
so can be studied immediately with high-resolution photometric and
spectroscopic observations that can further clarify the nature of the system.
The planet was found as part of a new program of high-cadence follow-up
observations of high-magnification events. The detection of this planet,
despite the considerable difficulties imposed by Covid-19 (two KMT sites and
OGLE were shut down), illustrates the potential utility of this program.

necessary flexibility for accommodating heterogeneous services. However,
optimizing the scheduling of heterogeneous services with differing delay and
throughput requirements over 5G new radio is a challenging task. In this paper,
we investigate near optimal, low complexity scheduling of radio resources for
ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) when coexisting with enhanced
mobile broadband (eMBB) services. We demonstrate that maximizing the sum
throughput of eMBB services while servicing URLLC users, is, in the long-term,
equivalent to minimizing the number of URLLC placements in the time-frequency
grid; this result stems from reducing the number of infeasible placements for
eMBB, to which we refer to as ""conflicts"". To meet this new objective, we
propose and investigate new conflict-aware heuristics; a family of ""greedy"" and
a lightweight heuristic inspired by bin packing optimization, all of near
optimal performance. Moreover, having shed light on the impact of conflict in
layer-2 scheduling, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) emerges as a
competitive approach for conflict resolution, in addition to the well
established increased spectral efficiency with respect to OMA. The superior
performance of NOMA, thanks to alleviating conflicts,is showcased by extensive
numerical results.

statistical heterogeneity among clients: local datasets often come from
different but not entirely unrelated distributions, and personalization is,
therefore, necessary to achieve optimal results from each individual's
perspective. In this paper, we show how the excess risks of personalized
federated learning with a smooth, strongly convex loss depend on data
heterogeneity from a minimax point of view. Our analysis reveals a surprising
theorem of the alternative for personalized federated learning: there exists a
threshold such that (a) if a certain measure of data heterogeneity is below
this threshold, the FedAvg algorithm [McMahan et al., 2017] is minimax optimal;
(b) when the measure of heterogeneity is above this threshold, then doing pure
local training (i.e., clients solve empirical risk minimization problems on
their local datasets without any communication) is minimax optimal. As an
implication, our results show that the presumably difficult
(infinite-dimensional) problem of adapting to client-wise heterogeneity can be
reduced to a simple binary decision problem of choosing between the two
baseline algorithms. Our analysis relies on a new notion of algorithmic
stability that takes into account the nature of federated learning.

the inherent long-tail distribution of real-world data. Its performance is
largely affected by the data scarcity of novel classes. But the semantic
relation between the novel classes and the base classes is constant regardless
of the data availability. In this work, we investigate utilizing this semantic
relation together with the visual information and introduce explicit relation
reasoning into the learning of novel object detection. Specifically, we
represent each class concept by a semantic embedding learned from a large

using the raw embeddings with a heuristic knowledge graph and propose to
augment the embeddings with a dynamic relation graph. As a result, our few-shot

novel objects. Experiments show that SRR-FSD can achieve competitive results at
higher shots, and more importantly, a significantly better performance given
both lower explicit and implicit shots. The benchmark protocol with implicit
shots removed from the pretrained classification dataset can serve as a more

literature on fair ML in credit scoring is scarce. The paper makes three
contributions. First, we revisit statistical fairness criteria and examine

incorporating fairness goals in the ML model development pipeline. Last, we
empirically compare different fairness processors in a profit-oriented credit

evaluation of fairness measures, identify suitable options to implement fair
credit scoring, and clarify the profit-fairness trade-off in lending decisions.
We find that multiple fairness criteria can be approximately satisfied at once
and recommend separation as a proper criterion for measuring the fairness of a
scorecard. We also find fair in-processors to deliver a good balance between
profit and fairness and show that algorithmic discrimination can be reduced to
a reasonable level at a relatively low cost. The codes corresponding to the

loss. Indeed, this leads the model to be susceptible to attacks that scale the
logits. The original model shows an accuracy of 59% under AutoAttack - when
trained with additional data with pseudo-labels. We provide an analysis that
shows the opposite. In particular, we craft a PGD attack multiplying the logits
by a positive scalar that decreases the GAIRAT accuracy from from 55% to 44%,
when trained solely on CIFAR-10. In this report, we rigorously evaluate the
model and provide insights into the reasons behind the vulnerability of GAIRAT
to this adversarial attack. The code to reproduce our evaluation is made

Among these color centers, the tin-vacancy (SnV$^{\,\textrm{-}}$) center is of
particular interest because its large ground-state splitting enables long spin
coherence times at temperatures above 1$\,$K. However, color centers typically
suffer from inhomogeneous broadening, which can be exacerbated by
nanofabrication-induced strain, hindering the implementation of quantum nodes
emitting indistinguishable photons. Although strain and Raman tuning have been
investigated as promising techniques to overcome the spectral mismatch between
distinct group-IV color centers, other approaches need to be explored to find
methods that can offer more localized control without sacrificing emission
intensity. Here, we study electrical tuning of SnV$^{\,\textrm{-}}$ centers in
diamond via the direct-current Stark effect. We demonstrate a tuning range
beyond 1.7$\,$GHz. We observe both quadratic and linear dependence on the
applied electric field. We also confirm that the tuning effect we observe is a
result of the applied electric field and is distinct from thermal tuning due to
Joule heating. Stark tuning is a promising avenue toward overcoming detunings
between emitters and enabling the realization of multiple identical quantum

in non-speech audio processing. Most of current research in ESC focuses on
designing deep models with special architectures tailored for specific audio
datasets, which usually cannot exploit the intrinsic patterns in the data.
However recent studies have surprisingly shown that transfer learning from
models trained on ImageNet is a very effective technique in ESC. Herein, we
propose SoundCLR, a supervised contrastive learning method for effective
environment sound classification with state-of-the-art performance, which works
by learning representations that disentangle the samples of each class from
those of other classes. Our deep network models are trained by combining a
contrastive loss that contributes to a better probability output by the
classification layer with a cross-entropy loss on the output of the classifier
layer to map the samples to their respective 1-hot encoded labels. Due to the
comparatively small sizes of the available environmental sound datasets, we
propose and exploit a transfer learning and strong data augmentation pipeline
and apply the augmentations on both the sound signals and their log-mel
spectrograms before inputting them to the model. Our experiments show that our
masking based augmentation technique on the log-mel spectrograms can
significantly improve the recognition performance. Our extensive benchmark

linear parameter models can update as fast as the feedback control loop. We
propose an online composite adaptation method that treats outputs from a deep
neural network as a set of basis functions capable of representing different
wind conditions. To help with training, meta-learning techniques are used to
optimize the network output useful for adaptation. We validate our approach by
flying a drone in an open air wind tunnel under varying wind conditions and
along challenging trajectories. We compare the result with other adaptive
controller with different basis function sets and show improvement over
tracking and prediction errors.

evaluated physically grounded perception of complex social interactions that go
beyond short actions, such as high-fiving, or simple group activities, such as

social events, PHASE, that resemble a wide range of real-life social
interactions by including social concepts such as helping another agent. PHASE
consists of 2D animations of pairs of agents moving in a continuous space
generated procedurally using a physics engine and a hierarchical planner.
Agents have a limited field of view, and can interact with multiple objects, in
an environment that has multiple landmarks and obstacles. Using PHASE, we
design a social recognition task and a social prediction task. PHASE is
validated with human experiments demonstrating that humans perceive rich
interactions in the social events, and that the simulated agents behave
similarly to humans. As a baseline model, we introduce a Bayesian inverse
planning approach, SIMPLE (SIMulation, Planning and Local Estimation), which
outperforms state-of-the-art feed-forward neural networks. We hope that PHASE

distinction between vectors, scalars and operators. For quantum processes that

proposed by Coecke and Kissinger, in the form of a diagrammatic formalism
[CK2017]. Their notation expresses formulas in the form of diagrams, somewhat
similar to Feynman diagrams, and is more general than the circuit notation for
quantum computing.
  This document consists of two parts. (1) We give a brief summary of the
diagrammatic notation of quantum processes, tailored to readers who already
know quantum physics and are not interested in general process theory. For this
audience our summary is less daunting than the encyclopaedic book by Coecke and
Kissinger [CK2017], and on the other hand more accessible than the
ultra-compact introduction of [KTW2017]. We deviate a somewhat from
[CK2017,KTW2017] in that we do not assume basis states to equal their own
complex conjugate; this means that we do not use symmetric notation for basis
states, and it leads us to explicitly show arrows on wires where they are
usually omitted.
  (2) We extend the work of Kissinger, Tull and Westerbaan [KTW2017] which
gives a diagrammatic security proof for BB84 and 6-state Quantum Key
Distribution. Their proof is based on a sequence of diagrammatic manipulations
that works when the bases used in the protocol are mutually unbiased. We extend
this result to 8-state encoding, which has been proposed as a tool in quantum

quantum realizations of non-Hermitian dynamics, and provides a starting point

properties and orientation with respect to filaments, and the morphology of the
magnetic field around these objects, for haloes with masses in the range
1e8-1e14 Msun and filaments up to 8 Mpc long. Furthermore, we study how these
properties vary in presence, or lack thereof, of different (astro)physical
processes and with different magnetic initial conditions. We perform
cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations with the Eulerian code Enzo and
we develop a simple and robust algorithm to study the filamentary connectivity
of haloes in three dimensions. We investigate the morphological and magnetic
properties and focus on the alignment of the magnetic field along filaments:
our analysis suggests that the degree of this alignment is partially dependent
on the physical processes involved, as well as on magnetic initial conditions.
We discuss the contribution of this effect on a potential attempt to detect the
magnetic field surrounding these objects: we find that it introduces a bias in
the estimation of the magnetic field from Faraday rotation measure techniques.
Specifically, given the strong tendency we find for extragalactic magnetic
fields to align with the filaments axis, the value of the magnetic field can be
underestimated by a factor 3, because this effect contributes to making the
line-of-sight magnetic field (for filaments in the plane of the sky) much

Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) physics. Its emergence is rooted in a U(1)-symmetry

Sm-substituted thin film BiFeO3 along the phase transition boundary from the

explored using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Localized
properties including polarization, lattice parameter, and chemical composition
are parameterized from atomic-scale imaging and their causal relationships are
reconstructed using a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM). This approach
is further extended toward exploring the spatial variability of the causal
coupling using the sliding window transform method, which revealed that new
causal relationships emerged both at the expected locations, such as domain
walls and interfaces, but also at additional regions forming clusters in the
vicinity of the walls or spatially distributed features. While the exact
physical origins of these relationships are unclear, they likely represent
nanophase separated regions in the morphotropic phase boundaries. Overall, we
pose that an in-depth understanding of complex disordered materials away from
thermodynamic equilibrium necessitates understanding not only of the generative
processes that can lead to observed microscopic states, but also the causal

subject to central and local differential privacy (DP/LDP) constraints. It has
been shown that the superposition nature of the wireless channel provides a
dual benefit of bandwidth efficient gradient aggregation, in conjunction with
strong DP guarantees for the users. Specifically, the central DP privacy
leakage has been shown to scale as $\mathcal{O}(1/K^{1/2})$, where $K$ is the
number of users. It has also been shown that user sampling coupled with
orthogonal transmission can enhance the central DP privacy leakage with the
same scaling behavior. In this work, we show that, by join incorporating both
wireless aggregation and user sampling, one can obtain even stronger privacy
guarantees. We propose a private wireless gradient aggregation scheme, which
relies on independently randomized participation decisions by each user. The
central DP leakage of our proposed scheme scales as $\mathcal{O}(1/K^{3/4})$.
In addition, we show that LDP is also boosted by user sampling. We also present
analysis for the convergence rate of the proposed scheme and study the
tradeoffs between wireless resources, convergence, and privacy theoretically

Volumes are too low-resolution given a reasonable memory budget, and
high-resolution implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields are too
slow for use in real-time applications. We present Mixture of Volumetric
Primitives (MVP), a representation for rendering dynamic 3D content that
combines the completeness of volumetric representations with the efficiency of
primitive-based rendering, e.g., point-based or mesh-based methods. Our
approach achieves this by leveraging spatially shared computation with a
deconvolutional architecture and by minimizing computation in empty regions of
space with volumetric primitives that can move to cover only occupied regions.
Our parameterization supports the integration of correspondence and tracking
constraints, while being robust to areas where classical tracking fails, such
as around thin or translucent structures and areas with large topological
variability. MVP is a hybrid that generalizes both volumetric and
primitive-based representations. Through a series of extensive experiments we
demonstrate that it inherits the strengths of each, while avoiding many of
their limitations. We also compare our approach to several state-of-the-art

significantly less sample efficient than off-policy methods in multi-agent

multi-agent settings. We show that PPO-based multi-agent algorithms achieve
surprisingly strong performance in four popular multi-agent testbeds: the
particle-world environments, the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, Google
Research Football, and the Hanabi challenge, with minimal hyperparameter tuning
and without any domain-specific algorithmic modifications or architectures.
Importantly, compared to competitive off-policy methods, PPO often achieves
competitive or superior results in both final returns and sample efficiency.
Finally, through ablation studies, we analyze implementation and hyperparameter
factors that are critical to PPO's empirical performance, and give concrete
practical suggestions regarding these factors. Our results show that when using

mathematical, engineering and physical ideas from the very beginning. Cannon in
his ""The wisdom of the body"" (1932) used the engineering vision of regulation.
In 1938, Selye enriched this approach by the notion of adaptation energy. This
term causes much debate when one takes it literally, i.e. as a sort of energy.
Selye did not use the language of mathematics, but the formalization of his
phenomenological theory in the spirit of thermodynamics was simple and led to
verifiable predictions. In 1980s, the dynamics of correlation and variance in
systems under adaptation to a load of environmental factors were studied and
the universal effect in ensembles of systems under a load of similar factors
was discovered: in a crisis, as a rule, even before the onset of obvious
symptoms of stress, the correlation increases together with variance (and
volatility). During 30 years, this effect has been supported by many
observations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on financial
time series. In the last ten years, these results were supplemented by many new
experiments, from gene networks in cardiology and oncology to dynamics of
depression and clinical psychotherapy. Several systems of models were
developed: the thermodynamic-like theory of adaptation of ensembles and several
families of models of individual adaptation. Historically, the first group of
models was based on Selye's concept of adaptation energy and used fitness
estimates. Two other groups of models are based on the idea of hidden attractor
bifurcation and on the advection--diffusion model for distribution of
population in the space of physiological attributes. We explore this world of
models and experiments, starting with classic works, with particular attention
to the results of the last ten years and open questions.

within 300 km/s from the quasar systemic redshifts estimated from the nebular

LAEs show similar shapes with respect to LAEs away from quasars suggesting that
the Lyalpha emission of the majority of these sources is not significantly
boosted by the quasar radiation or other processes related to the quasar

probability when the octupole-order effects, also known as the eccentric Kozai
mechanism, are important. This can be the case when the tertiary is of
comparable mass to the binary components. Since the octupole strength [$\propto
(1-q)/(1+q)$] increases with decreasing binary mass ratio $q$, such ZLK-induced
mergers favor binaries with smaller mass ratios. We use a combination of
numerical and analytical approaches to fully characterize the octupole-enhanced
binary BH mergers and provide analytical criteria for efficiently calculating
the strength of this enhancement. We show that for hierarchical triples with
semi-major axis ratio $a/a_{\rm out}\gtrsim 0.01$-$0.02$, the binary merger

cosmology and galaxy formation using multi-frequency, low angular resolution

intensity maps, or of intensity maps with galaxy surveys or galaxy/CMB lensing.
We present a consistent halo model to predict all these cross-correlations and
enable joint analyses, in 3D redshift-space and for 2D projected maps. We
extend the conditional luminosity function formalism to the multi-line case, to
consistently account for correlated scatter between multiple galaxy line
luminosities. This allows us to model the scale-dependent decorrelation between
two line intensity maps, a key input for foreground rejection and for
approaches that estimate auto-spectra from cross-spectra. This also enables LIM
cross-correlations to reveal astrophysical properties of the interstellar
medium inacessible with LIM auto-spectra. We expose the different sources of
luminosity scatter or ""line noise"" in LIM, and clarify their effects on the
1-halo and galaxy shot noise terms. In particular, we show that the effective
number density of halos can in some cases exceed that of galaxies,
counterintuitively. Using observational and simulation input, we implement this

Standard Model tests; to describe crossed channels in the quest for exotic
hadronic states; and for an improved spectroscopy of excited kaon resonances.
In the elastic region, the phase shifts of $\pi K$ scattering in a given
partial wave are related to the phases of the respective $\pi K$ form factors
by Watson's theorem. Going beyond that, we here construct a representation of
the scalar $\pi K$ form factor that includes inelastic effects via resonance
exchange, while fulfilling all constraints from $\pi K$ scattering and
maintaining the correct analytic structure. As a first application, we consider
the decay ${\tau\to K_S\pi\nu_\tau}$, in particular, we study to which extent

least some subset of the empirical class of fast blue optical transients
(FBOTs) represents a genuinely new astrophysical phenomenon. Unfortunately, the
intrinsic rarity and fleeting nature of these events have made it difficult to
identify additional examples early enough to acquire the observations necessary
to constrain theoretical models. We present here the Zwicky Transient Facility
discovery of AT2020xnd (ZTF20acigmel, the ""Camel"") at z=0.243, the first
unambiguous AT2018cow analog to be found and confirmed in real time. AT2018cow
and AT2020xnd share all key observational properties: a fast optical rise,
sustained high photospheric temperature, absence of a second peak attributable
to ejection of a radioactively-heated stellar envelope, extremely luminous
radio, millimetre, and X-ray emission, and a dwarf-galaxy host. This supports
the argument that AT2018cow-like events represent a distinct phenomenon from
slower-evolving radio-quiet supernovae, likely requiring a different progenitor
or a different central engine. The sample properties of the four known members
of this class to date disfavour tidal disruption models but are consistent with
the alternative model of an accretion powered jet following the direct collapse
of a massive star to a black hole. Contextual filtering of alert streams
combined with rapid photometric verification using multi-band imaging provides
an efficient way to identify future members of this class, even at high
redshift.

based on the UMS sample is generally consistent with previous models of the

galaxies and map the matter density field at high redshift. Building upon the
formalism in the companion paper, we first highlight the degeneracies between
cosmology and astrophysics in LIM. We discuss what can be constrained from
measurements of the mean intensity and redshift-space power spectra. With a
sufficient spectral resolution, the large-scale redshift-space distortions of
the 2-halo term can be measured, helping to break the degeneracy between bias
and mean intensity. With a higher spectral resolution, measuring the
small-scale redshift-space distortions disentangles the 1-halo and shot noise
terms. Cross-correlations with external galaxy catalogs or lensing surveys
further break degeneracies. We derive requirements for experiments similar to
SPHEREx, HETDEX, CDIM, COMAP and CONCERTO. We then revisit the question of the
optimality of the LIM observables, compared to galaxy detection, for
astrophysics and cosmology. We use a matched filter to compute the luminosity
detection threshold for individual sources. We show that LIM contains
information about galaxies too faint to detect, in the high-noise or
high-confusion regimes. We quantify the sparsity and clustering bias of the
detected sources and compare them to LIM, showing in which cases LIM is a
better tracer of the matter density. We extend previous work by answering these
questions as a function of Fourier scale, including for the first time the
effect of cosmic variance, pixel-to-pixel correlations, luminosity-dependent
clustering bias and redshift-space distortions.

the radius -- luminosity ($R-L$) relation using the Mg II emission line are
critical for determining these masses near the peak of quasar activity at $z

that can be applied to large samples with only single-epoch spectroscopy. We
present the first nine Mg II lags from our five-year Australian Dark Energy

number and quality of Mg II lag measurements. As the Mg II feature is somewhat
blended with iron emission, we model and subtract both the continuum and iron
contamination from the multi-epoch spectra before analyzing the Mg II line. We
also develop a new method of quantifying correlated spectroscopic calibration
errors based on our numerous, contemporaneous observations of F-stars. The lag
measurements for seven of our nine sources are consistent with both the
H$\beta$ and Mg II $R-L$ relations reported by previous studies. Our
simulations verify the lag reliability of our nine measurements, and we

shaping the properties of planetary systems. We investigate how the
multiplicity distributions and orbital periods of planetary systems depend on
the 6D phase space density of stars surrounding planet host systems. We find
that stars in high stellar phase space density environments (overdensities)
have a factor 1.6 - 2.0 excess in the number of single planet systems compared
to stars in low stellar phase space density environments (the field). The
multiplicity distribution of planets around field stars is much flatter (i.e.
there is a greater fraction of multi-planet systems) than in overdensities.
This result is primarily driven by the combined facts that: (i) `hot Jupiters'
(HJs) are almost exclusively found in overdensities; (ii) HJs are predominantly
observed to be single-planet systems. Nevertheless, we find that the difference
in multiplicity is even more pronounced when only considering planets in the
Kepler sample, which contains few HJs. This suggests that the Kepler dichotomy
-- an apparent excess of systems with a single transiting planet -- plausibly
arises from environmental perturbations. In overdensities, the orbital periods
of single-planet systems are smaller than orbital periods of multiple-planet
systems. As this difference is more pronounced in overdensities, the mechanism
responsible for this effect may be enhanced by stellar clustering. Taken
together, the pronounced dependence of planetary multiplicity and orbital
period distributions on stellar clustering provides a potentially powerful tool
to diagnose the impact of environment on the formation and evolution of
planetary systems.

Three N emission features (N V $\lambda\lambda 1238,1242$, N IV $\lambda 1719$,
N IV $\lambda\lambda 3479 - 3485$) are unambiguously identified in the
spectrum. CMFGEN models of the star yield a N/C ratio of $0.004 \pm 0.002$ (by
number) and a C/He ratio of $0.15_{-0.05}^{+0.10}$. Due to the similarity of
BAT99-9 to other WC4 stars, and the good fit achieved by CMFGEN to both the
classic WC4 spectrum, and the N lines, we argue that the N lines are intrinsic
to BAT99-9. An examination of a limited set of rotating models for single star
evolution at LMC and Galactic metallicities shows that a model with a Galactic
metallicity ($z=0.014$) and a progenitor mass of around $50\,M_\odot$ can have
a N/C ratio similar to, or larger than, what we observe for a significant

with the observations. Both the single and binary BPASS models predict that
many WC stars can have a N/C ratio similar to, or larger than, what we observe

functions of the scalar curvature, $f_1$ and $f_2$, where the first one
generalises the Hilbert-Einstein action, while the second couples to the matter
Lagrangian. On the one hand, assuming a $\Lambda$CDM background, we calculate
analytical solutions for the functions $f_1$ and $f_2$. We consider two setups:
on the first one, we fix $f_2$ and compute $f_1$ and on the second one, we fix
$f_1$ and compute $f_2$. Moreover, we do the analysis for two different energy
density contents, a matter dominated universe and a general perfect fluid with
a constant equation of state fuelling the universe expansion. On the other
hand, we complete our study by performing a cosmographic analysis for $f_1$ and
$f_2$. We conclude that the gravitational coupling to matter can drive the
accelerated expansion of the universe.

accelerate the computations of $N$-body dynamical systems and their pair-wise

methods, like the Barnes-Hut method, which requires online tree building of the
state space, or the fast-multipole method, which requires rigorous $a$ $priori$
analysis of governing kernels and online tree building. Our approach combines
Barnes-Hut hierarchical decomposition, dimensional compression via the
least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) projection, and hyper-reduction by way of
the Gauss-Newton with approximated tensor (GNAT) approach. The resulting
$projection-tree$ reduced order model (PTROM) enables a drastic reduction in
operational count complexity by constructing sparse hyper-reduced pairwise
interactions of the $N$-body dynamical system. As a result, the presented
framework is capable of achieving an operational count complexity that is
independent of $N$, the number of bodies in the numerical domain. Capabilities
of the PTROM method are demonstrated on the two-dimensional fluid-dynamic
Biot-Savart kernel within a parametric and reproductive setting. Results show
the PTROM is capable of achieving over 2000$\times$ wall-time speed-up with
respect to the full-order model, where the speed-up increases with $N$. The
resulting solution delivers quantities of interest with errors that are less
than 0.1$\%$ with respect to full-order model.

moderate-resolution infrared spectroscopy, which reveals projected rotational
velocities between 79 and 104 km s$^{-1}$. We compare the near-infrared spectra
to photospheric models to determine the objects' fundamental parameters and
radial velocities. We find that the equatorial rotational velocities for all
three objects are $\gtrsim$100 km s$^{-1}$. The three L and T dwarfs reported
here are the most rapidly spinning and likely the most oblate field ultra-cool
dwarfs known to date. Correspondingly, all three are excellent candidates for
seeking auroral radio emission and net optical/infrared polarization. As of

gMiniWoB, which enables an RL adversary to use compositional primitives to
learn to generate arbitrarily complex websites. To train the adversary, we
propose a new technique for maximizing regret using the difference in the
scores obtained by a pair of navigator agents. Our results show that our
approach significantly outperforms prior methods for minimax regret AEG. The
regret objective trains the adversary to design a curriculum of environments
that are ""just-the-right-challenge"" for the navigator agents; our results show
that over time, the adversary learns to generate increasingly complex web
navigation tasks. The navigator agents trained with our technique learn to
complete challenging, high-dimensional web navigation tasks, such as form

are limited in cases where enough data may not be available to estimate the
large number of parameters that these non-linear models require. This paper
presents an easy to implement data augmentation method to significantly improve
the performance of such networks. Our method, Augmented-Neural-Network, which

dwarfs exhibit Balmer emission lines. The temperature inversion mechanism is a
puzzle over 30 years old that has defied conventional explanations. One
hypothesis is a unipolar inductor that achieves surface heating via ohmic
dissipation of a current loop between a conducting planet and a magnetic white
dwarf. To investigate this model, new time-resolved spectroscopy,
spectropolarimetry, and photometry of the prototype GD 356 are studied. The
emission features vary in strength on the rotational period, but in anti-phase
with the light curve, consistent with a cool surface spot beneath an optically
thin chromosphere. Possible changes in the line profiles are observed at the
same photometric phase, potentially suggesting modest evolution of the emission
region, while the magnetic field varies by 10 per cent over a full rotation.
These comprehensive data reveal neither changes to the photometric period, nor
additional signals such as might be expected from an orbiting body. A closer
examination of the unipolar inductor model finds points of potential failure:
the observed rapid stellar rotation will inhibit current carriers due to the
centrifugal force, there may be no supply of magnetospheric ions, and no
anti-phase flux changes are expected from ohmic surface heating. Together with
the highly similar properties of the four cool, emission-line white dwarfs,
these facts indicate that the chromospheric emission is intrinsic. A
tantalizing possibility is that intrinsic chromospheres may manifest in
(magnetic) white dwarfs, and in distinct parts of the HR diagram based on
structure and composition.

CP violation in the quark sector. After the spontaneous symmetry breaking, the
masses and physical fields of the particle content are obtained. The fermions
content of the 331 model is enlarged to include exotic quarks with known
electric charge and with masses defined at the TeV scale. The existence of
these exotic quarks induces extra CP violations via couplings with quarks of
the Standard Model mediated by charged gauge boson with mass fixed at the TeV
scale. An extra discrete $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry is introduced in the 331
model to get a stable scalar field that can be a candidate to the dark matter
content. The new scalar field interacts at tree level with the $Z^{\prime}$
gauge boson that works as a dark matter portal. The relic density associated
with the scalar field is calculated to yield the solution mass that satisfies
the observed dark matter. The region allowed on the parameter space of the dark
matter mass versus $Z^{\prime}$ mass is obtained to include the bounds of
PANDAX2017, XENON1T(2t.y) and LUX experiments.

tumor-immune system models aiming to provide mechanistic understanding and
indicate more efficient treatment regimes. However, the complexity of such
models, their multi-scale dynamics and their overparameterized character
renders them inaccessible for wide utilization. In this work, the dynamics of a
fundamental model formulating the interactions of tumor cells with natural
killer cells, CD8$^+$ T cells and circulating lymphocytes is examined. It is
first shown that the long-term evolution of the system towards high-tumor or
tumor-free equilibria is determined by the dynamics of an initial
\emph{explosive stage} of tumor progression. Focusing on this stage, the
algorithmic Computational Singular Perturbation methodology is employed to
identify the underlying mechanisms confining the system's evolution towards the
equilibrium and the governing slow dynamics along them. It is shown that these
insights are preserved along different tumor-immune system and
patient-dependent realizations. Utilizing the obtained mechanistic
understanding, a novel reduced model is constructed in an algorithmic fashion,
which accurately predicts the dynamics of the system during the explosive stage
and includes half of the parameters of the detailed model. This present
analysis demonstrates the potential of algorithmic asymptotic analysis to
simplify the complex, overeparameterized and multi-scale nature of cancer
immunology models and to indicate the interactions and cell types to target for
more effective treatment development.

empirically evaluate textual merge conflicts in Microsoft Edge and classify
them based on the type of files, location of conflicts in a file, and the size
of conflicts. We found that ~28% of the merge conflicts are 1-2 line changes,
and many resolutions have frequent patterns. Second, driven by these findings,
we explore Program Synthesis (for the first time) to learn patterns and resolve

learn resolution strategies as programs in this DSL from example resolutions.
We found that the learned strategies can resolve 11.4% of the conflicts (~41%

Accretion onto a magnetic white dwarf is one of the proposed scenarios for
these systems. To verify this possibility, we analysed photometric and
polarimetric time-series data for a sample of six SW Sex stars. We report
possible modulated circular polarization in BO Cet, SW Sex, and UU Aqr with
periods of 11.1, 41.2 and 25.7 min, respectively, and less significant

previous results that LS Peg shows variable circular polarization. However, we
determine a period of 18.8 min, which is different from the earlier reported
value. We interpret these periods as the spin periods of the white dwarfs. Our
polarimetric results indicate that 15% of the SW Sex systems have direct
evidence of magnetic accretion. We also discuss SW Sex objects within the
perspective of being magnetic systems, considering the latest findings about

urban mobility: $r \cdot f$, the product of distance traveled $r$ and frequency
of return $f$ per user to a given location, is invariant across space. This
paper asks whether the invariant $r\cdot f$ also serves as a driver for
epidemic spread, so that the risk associated with human movement can be modeled
by a unifying variable $r\cdot f$. We use two large-scale datasets of
individual human mobility to show that there is in fact a simple relation
between $r$ and $f$ and both speed and spatial dispersion of disease spread.
This discovery could assist in modeling spread of disease and inform travel
policies in future epidemics -- based not only on travel distance $r$ but also
on frequency of return $f$.

are irrevocable since they operate on a transient data stream. We first
rigorously analyze a deterministic variant of the online threat model by

computer science and propose Virtual+, a simple yet practical online algorithm.
Our main theoretical result shows Virtual+ yields provably the best competitive

condition of the esophagus associated with elevated numbers of eosinophils.
Disease diagnosis and monitoring requires determining the concentration of
eosinophils in esophageal biopsies, a time-consuming, tedious and somewhat
subjective task currently performed by pathologists. Methods. Herein, we aimed
to use machine learning to identify, quantitate and diagnose EoE. We labeled
more than 100M pixels of 4345 images obtained by scanning whole slides of
H&E-stained sections of esophageal biopsies derived from 23 EoE patients. We
used this dataset to train a multi-label segmentation deep network. To validate
the network, we examined a replication cohort of 1089 whole slide images from
419 patients derived from multiple institutions. Findings. PECNet segmented
both intact and not-intact eosinophils with a mean intersection over union
(mIoU) of 0.93. This segmentation was able to quantitate intact eosinophils
with a mean absolute error of 0.611 eosinophils and classify EoE disease
activity with an accuracy of 98.5%. Using whole slide images from the
validation cohort, PECNet achieved an accuracy of 94.8%, sensitivity of 94.3%,
and specificity of 95.14% in reporting EoE disease activity. Interpretation. We
have developed a deep learning multi-label semantic segmentation network that
successfully addresses two of the main challenges in EoE diagnostics and
digital pathology, the need to detect several types of small features
simultaneously and the ability to analyze whole slides efficiently. Our results
pave the way for an automated diagnosis of EoE and can be utilized for other
conditions with similar challenges.

at a certain point of the deep neural network, where we disentangle the
information about the bias, still letting the useful information for the
training task forward-propagating in the rest of the model. One big advantage
of EnD is that we do not require additional training complexity (like decoders
or extra layers in the model), since it is a regularizer directly applied on
the trained model. Our experiments show that EnD effectively improves the
generalization on unbiased test sets, and it can be effectively applied on
real-case scenarios, like removing hidden biases in the COVID-19 detection from

""manning model"" quantitatively measures signal maintenance burden including
Federally mandated tests, trouble tickets, non-FRA maintenance, overhead and
vacation coverage, location/shift assignment, administrative process, and work
curfew productivity losses. It is capable of delivering immediate results by
rightsizing allocation of workforce across shifts and maintenance base
locations--even before all assets are formally inventoried. Typical data from a
commuter passenger railroad shows that work curfews and shift assignment
constraints have significant impacts on workforce productivity. Just over half
of signal maintenance employee-hours are devoted to Federally mandated tests,
whilst non-FRA and repair maintenance consumes about 25% each. These indicators
provide intelligence driving strategic management actions to improve signal
maintenance cost-effectiveness. This model provides workload-based employee
assignment by craft, location, gang, and shift for maintenance manager use, but
also provides analytical basis for establishing or abolishing positions in the
budgeting process. Comparing its results with current employee payroll provides
a measure of how much staffing stress the maintenance organization is under,
which can help measure whether the current overtime usage is appropriate. Asset
and maintenance task inventories collected in this process can also feed normal
asset management processes to assess replacement cycles, asset failure risk,

due to their extreme apparent super-Eddington luminosities, their nature is

could be a diversified group of objects composed of low-mass X-ray binaries,
high-mass X-ray binaries and marginally also systems containing
intermediate-mass black holes, which is supported by their presence in a
variety of environments. Observational data on the ULX donors could
significantly boost our understanding of these systems, but only a few were
detected. There are several candidates, mostly red supergiants (RSGs), but
surveys are typically biased toward luminous near-infrared objects.
Nevertheless, it is worth exploring if RSGs can be members of ULX binaries. In
such systems matter accreted onto the compact body would have to be provided by
the stellar wind of the companion, since a Roche-lobe overflow could be
unstable for relevant mass-ratios. Here we present a comprehensive study of the
evolution and population of wind-fed ULXs and provide a theoretical support for
the link between RSGs and ULXs. Our estimated upper limit on contribution of
wind-fed ULX to the overall ULX population is $\sim75$--$96\%$ for young
($<100$ Myr) star forming environments, $\sim 49$--$87\%$ for prolonged
constant star formation (e.g., disk of Milky Way), and $\lesssim1\%$ for
environments in which star formation ceased long time ($>2$ Gyr) ago. We show
also that some wind-fed ULXs (up to $6\%$) may evolve into merging double
compact objects (DCOs), but typical systems are not viable progenitors of such
binaries because of their large separations. We demonstrate that, the exclusion
of wind-fed ULXs from population studies of ULXs, might have lead to
systematical errors in their conclusions.

functionals in density-functional theory (DFT) was presented (U. Mordovina et.
al., JCTC 15, 5209 (2019)), which relies on approximations to the interacting
wave function using density-matrix embedding theory (DMET). This approximate
interacting wave function is constructed by using a projection determined by an
iterative procedure that makes parts of the reduced density matrix of an
auxiliary system the same as the approximate interacting density matrix. If
only the diagonal of both systems are connected this leads to an approximation
of the interacting-to-non-interacting mapping of the Kohn-Sham approach to DFT.
Yet other choices are possible and allow to connect DMET with other DFTs such
as kinetic-energy DFT or reduced density-matrix functional theory. In this work
we give a detailed review of the basics of the DMET procedure from a DFT
perspective and show how both approaches can be used to supplement each other.
We do so explicitly for the case of a one-dimensional lattice system, as this
is the simplest setting where we can apply DMET and the one that was originally
presented. Among others we highlight how the mappings of DFTs can be used to
identify uniquely defined auxiliary systems and auxiliary projections in DMET
and how to construct approximations for different DFTs using DMET inspired
projections. Such alternative approximation strategies become especially
important for DFTs that are based on non-linearly coupled observables such as
kinetic-energy DFT, where the Kohn-Sham fields are no longer simply obtainable
by functional differentiation of an energy expression, or for reduced
density-matrix functional theories, where a straightforward Kohn-Sham
construction is not feasible.

has previously thwarted attempts to recover the three-dimensional structure of

line-of-sight direction, it is highly organized in the field-aligned direction.
This paper demonstrates how to exploit this organization to resolve the
line-of-sight degeneracy in the plasma properties using a suitable magnetic
field structure. A preliminary investigation with a potential field is shown,
finding a solution which clearly resembles the real solar data, even with a
single perspective. The results indicate that there is ample information in the

synthetic beamforming relies on a double focusing operation at transmission and
reception on each point of the medium. Ultrasound matrix imaging (UMI) consists
in decoupling the location of these transmitted and received focal spots. The
response between those virtual transducers form the so-called focused
reflection matrix that actually contains much more information than a confocal
ultrasound image. In this paper, a time-frequency analysis of this matrix is
performed, which highlights the single and multiple scattering contributions as
well as the impact of aberrations in the monochromatic and broadband regimes.
Interestingly, this analysis enables the measurement of the incoherent
input-output point spread function at any pixel of this image. A fitting
process enables the quantification of the single scattering, multiple
scattering and noise components in the image. From the single scattering
contribution, a focusing criterion is defined, and its evolution used to
quantify the amount of aberration throughout the ultrasound image. In contrast
to the state-of-the-art coherence factor, this new indicator is robust to
multiple scattering and electronic noise, thereby providing a contrasted map of
the focusing quality at a much better transverse resolution. After a validation
of the proof-of-concept based on time-domain simulations, UMI is applied to the

sequential regression multiple imputation (SRMI), also called chained equations
multiple imputation. In this approach, we impute missing values using
regression models for each variable, conditional on the other variables in the
data. This approach, however, assumes that the missingness mechanism is missing
at random, and it is not well-justified under not-at-random missingness without
additional modification. In this paper, we describe how we can generalize the
SRMI imputation procedure to handle not-at-random missingness (MNAR) in the
setting where missingness may depend on other variables that are also missing.
We provide algebraic justification for several generalizations of standard SRMI
using Taylor series and other approximations of the target imputation
distribution under MNAR. Resulting regression model approximations include
indicators for missingness, interactions, or other functions of the MNAR
missingness model and observed data. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that
the proposed SRMI modifications result in reduced bias in the final analysis
compared to standard SRMI, with an approximation strategy involving inclusion
of an offset in the imputation model performing the best overall. The method is
illustrated in a breast cancer study, where the goal is to estimate the
prevalence of a specific genetic pathogenic variant.

focusing can compensate for aberration, but is only effective over a restricted
area called the isoplanatic patch. Here, we use an experimentally-recorded
matrix of reflected acoustic signals tosynthesize a set of virtual transducers.
We then examine wave propagation between these virtual transducers and an
arbitrary correction plane. Such wave-fronts consist of two components: (i) An
ideal geometric wave-front linked to diffraction and the input focusing point,
and; (ii) Phase distortions induced by the speed-of-sound variations. These
distortions are stored in a so-called distortion matrix, the singular value
decomposition of which gives access to an optimized focusing law at any point.
We show that, by decoupling the aberrations undergone by the outgoing and
incoming waves and applying an iterative strategy, compensation for even
high-order and spatially-distributed aberrations can be achieved. After a
numerical validation of the process, ultrasound matrix imaging (UMI) is applied
to the in-vivo imaging of a gallbladder. A map of isoplanatic modes is
retrieved and is shown to be strongly correlated with the arrangement of
tissues constituting the medium. The corresponding focusing laws yield an
ultrasound image with drastically improved contrast and transverse resolution.
UMI thus provides a flexible and powerful route towards computational
ultrasound.

of combinatorial samples produced on a commercial laser powder bed fusion
system to study 60 distinct process conditions of nickel superalloy 625: five
laser powers and four laser scan speeds in three different conditions.
Combinatorial samples were characterized using optical and electron microscopy,
x-ray diffraction, and indentation to estimate the porosity, grain size,
crystallographic texture, secondary phase precipitation, and hardness.
Indentation and porosity results were compared against a regular sample. The
smaller-sized regions (3 mm x 4 mm) in the combinatorial sample have a lower
hardness compared to a larger regular sample (20 mm x 20 mm) with similar
porosity (< 0.03 %). Despite this difference, meaningful trends were identified
with the combinatorial sample for grain size, crystallographic texture, and
porosity versus laser power and scan speed as well as trends with hardness
versus stress-relief condition.

the physical characteristics of single polymers. Typically, molecules are
functionalized for specific attachment to a glass surface at one end and a
micron-scale paramagnetic beads at the other. By applying an external magnetic
field, multiple molecules can be stretched and twisted simultaneously without
exposure to potentially damaging radiation. The majority of MT utilize moving
permanent magnets to produce the forces on the beads (and the molecule under
test). However, translating and rotating the permanent magnets may require
expensive precision actuators, limits the rate at which force is changed, and
may induce vibrations that disturb tether dynamics. Alternatively, the magnetic
field can be produced through an electromagnet which allows much faster force
modulation and eliminates motor-associated vibration. Here, we describe a
low-cost quadrapolar electromagnetic tweezer design capable of manipulating
DNA-tethered MyOne paramagnetic beads with forces of up to 20 pN. The
solid-state nature of the generated B-field modulated along two axes is
convenient for accessing the range of forces and torques relevant for studying
the activity of DNA motor enzymes like polymerases and helicases. Our design
specifically leverages technology available at an increasing number university
maker spaces and student-run machine shops. Thus, our design is not only
applicable to a wide range biophysical research questions, but also an
accessible tool for undergraduate education.

how the magnetic dynamo in the late-type component is affected by the close
white dwarf companion. We use space photometry, high resolution spectroscopy
and X-ray observations from different space instruments to explore the main
characteristics of magnetic activity. From K2 photomery we find that 5-10 per
cent of the apparent surface of the red dwarf is covered by cool starspots.
From seasonal photometric period changes we estimate a weak differential
rotation. From the flare activity we derive a cumulative flare frequency
diagram which suggests that frequent flaring could have a significant role in
heating the corona. Using high resolution spectroscopy we reconstruct four
Doppler images for different epochs which reveal an active longitude, that is,
a permanent dominant spot facing the white dwarf. From short term changes in
the consecutive Doppler images we derive a weak solar-type surface differential
rotation with 0.0026 shear coefficient, similar to that provided by photometry.
The long-term evolution of X-ray luminosity reveals a possible activity cycle
length of 12.7 ys, traces of which were discovered also in the H$\alpha$
spectra. We conclude that the magnetic activity of the red dwarf component in
V471 Tau is strongly influenced by the close white dwarf companion. We confirm
the presence of a permanent dominant spot (active longitude) on the red dwarf
facing the white dwarf. The weak differential rotation of the red dwarf is very
likely the result of tidal confinement by the companion. We find that the
periodic appearance of the inter-binary H$\alpha$ emission from the vicinity of
the inner Lagrangian point is correlated with the activity cycle.

in-depth study based on scholarly and patent publications covering STEM

investigation is the simultaneous examination of both the research output and
its impact in the same data set, using a novel machine learning based measure,
called saliency, to mitigate the intrinsic biases in quantifying the research
impact. The results show that the two effects are in fact co-occurring: there
are clear indications of convergence among the high income and upper middle
income countries across the STEM fields, but a widening gap is developing that
segregates the lower middle and low income regions from the higher income
regions. Furthermore, the rate of convergence varies notably among the STEM
sub-fields, with the highly strategic area of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
sandwiched between fields such as Medicine and Materials Science that occupy
the opposite ends of the spectrum. The data support the argument that a leading
explanation of the Matthew effect, namely, the preferential attachment theory,
can actually foster the catch-up effect when organizations from lower income
countries forge substantial research collaborations with those already
dominant. The data resoundingly show such collaborations benefit all parties
involved, and a case of role reversal can be seen in the Materials Science

notion of portfolios of scenarios, which it leverages in its probing for
alternative capacity-plans. At the core of the system, a trace-based,
discrete-event simulator enables the exploration of different possible

resources, and for horizontal (scale-out) and vertical (scale-up) scaling.
Capelin compares alternative topologies and for each gives detailed
quantitative operational information, which could facilitate human decisions of
capacity planning. We implement and open-source Capelin, and show through
comprehensive trace-based experiments it can aid practitioners. The results
give evidence that reasonable choices can be worse by a factor of 1.5-2.0 than

central arbitrator who can act as a gate-keeper. For this reason indexing of
new content even in otherwise decentralized networks (e.g. Bittorrent with DHT,
IPFS) has generally been left to centralized services such as torrent sites.
  Decentralized methods for spam prevention, such as Web of Trust, already
exist[1][2] but they require submitters to assume pseudonymous identities and
establish trust over time.
  In this paper we present a method of spam prevention that works under the
assumption that the participants are fully anonymous and do not want different
submissions of theirs to be linked to each other.
  By spam we do not specifically mean unsolicited advertising; rather it is the
practice of adding a large amount of content in a short time, saturating the
capacity of the network, and causing denial of service to peers. The purpose of
our solution is to prevent users from saturating the system, and can be
described as rate-limiting. The system should be censorship resistant: it
should not be possible for submissions to be excluded because of the content
itself, or for users to be excluded based on what they submit.
  We first discuss a solution based on a single, centralized rate-limiter that
is censorship resistant and anonymous, then we extend this to a fully
decentralized blockchain-based system and present methods to make it economical

process. To overcome these limitations, we develop a hexacopter testbed that
can print via fused deposition modeling during flight. We discuss the design of

successfully performing these initial print tests, we demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach and lay the groundwork for printing 3D parts and

asymmetric vortex sheets (AM,2021). These surfaces avoid the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability by adjusting their discontinuity and shape. The vorticity collapses
to the sheet only in an exceptional case considered long ago by Burgers and
Townsend, where it decays as a Gaussian on both sides of the sheet. In generic
asymmetric vortex sheets (Shariff,2021), vorticity leaks to one side or
another, making such sheets inadequate for vortex sheet statistics and
anomalous dissipation.
  We conjecture that the vorticity in a turbulent flow collapses on a special
kind of surface (confined vortex surface, or CVS), satisfying some equations
involving the tangent components of the local strain tensor.
  The most important qualitative observation is that the inequality needed for
this solution's stability breaks the Euler dynamics' time reversibility. We
interpret this as dynamic irreversibility. We have also represented the
enstrophy as a surface integral, conserved in the Navier-Stokes equation in the
turbulent limit, with vortex stretching and viscous diffusion terms exactly
canceling each other on the CVS surfaces.
  We have studied the CVS equations for the cylindrical vortex surface for an
arbitrary constant background strain with two different eigenvalues. This
equation reduces to a particular version of the stationary Birkhoff-Rott
equation for the 2D flow with an extra nonanalytic term. We study some general
properties of this equation and reduce its solution to a fixed point of a map
on a sphere, guaranteed to exist by the Brouwer theorem.

elevation angle of the incident light beams decreases. When the sky imager is
mounted on a solar tracker, the light beam's angle of incidence in a pixel

to the geospatial atmosphere cross-section where the sky imager field of view

Multiple ML usability challenges can appear as result, such as lack of user

useful information is due to sources whose images overlap with those of other
sources on the sky. The cosmic shear signal is primarily encoded in the
estimated shapes of observed galaxies and thus directly impacted by overlaps.
We introduce a framework based on the Fisher formalism to analyze effects of
overlapping sources (blending) on the estimation of cosmic shear. For the Rubin
Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we present the expected
loss in statistical sensitivity for the ten-year survey due to blending. We
find that for approximately 62% of galaxies that are likely to be detected in
full-depth LSST images, at least 1% of the flux in their pixels is from
overlapping sources. We also find that the statistical correlations between
measures of overlapping galaxies and, to a much lesser extent the higher shot
noise level due to their presence, decrease the effective number density of
galaxies, $N_{eff}$, by $\sim$18%. We calculate an upper limit on $N_{eff}$ of
39.4 galaxies per arcmin$^2$ in $r$ band. We study the impact of varying
stellar density on $N_{eff}$ and illustrate the diminishing returns of
extending the survey into lower Galactic latitudes. We extend the Fisher
formalism to predict the increase in pixel-noise bias due to blending for
maximum-likelihood (ML) shape estimators. We find that noise bias is sensitive
to the particular shape estimator and measure of ensemble-average shape that is
used, and properties of the galaxy that include redshift-dependent quantities
such as size and luminosity.

sharp decrease in model performance. The InstaHide method has recently been
proposed as an alternative to DP training that leverages supposed privacy
properties of the mixup augmentation, although without rigorous guarantees. In
this work, we show that strong data augmentations, such as mixup and random
additive noise, nullify poison attacks while enduring only a small accuracy
trade-off. To explain these finding, we propose a training method,
DP-InstaHide, which combines the mixup regularizer with additive noise. A
rigorous analysis of DP-InstaHide shows that mixup does indeed have privacy
advantages, and that training with k-way mixup provably yields at least k times
stronger DP guarantees than a naive DP mechanism. Because mixup (as opposed to
noise) is beneficial to model performance, DP-InstaHide provides a mechanism
for achieving stronger empirical performance against poisoning attacks than
other known DP methods.

ecology proposed to explain the patterns of biodiversity. Whereas niche theory
emphasizes selective differences between species and interspecific interactions
in shaping the community, neutral theory supposes functional equivalence
between species and points to stochasticity as the primary driver of ecological
dynamics. In this work, we draw a bridge between these two opposing theories.
Starting from a Lotka-Volterra (LV) model with demographic noise and random
symmetric interactions, we analytically derive the stationary population
statistics and species abundance distribution (SAD). Using these results, we
demonstrate that the model can exhibit three classes of SADs commonly found in
niche and neutral theories and found conditions that allow an ecosystem to
transition between these various regimes. Thus, we reconcile how neutral-like
statistics may arise from a diverse community with niche differentiation.

semi-supervised learning based on a student-teacher approach for training the
segmentation network using limited labeled samples and a large number of
unlabeled images. First, a teacher segmentation model is trained from the
labeled samples using Bayesian deep learning. The trained model is used to
generate soft segmentation labels and uncertainty maps for the unlabeled set.
The student model is then updated using the softly segmented samples and the
corresponding pixel-wise confidence of the segmentation quality estimated from
the uncertainty of the teacher model using a newly designed loss function.
Experimental results on a retinal layer segmentation task show that the
proposed method improves the segmentation performance in comparison to the
fully supervised approach and is on par with the expert annotator. The proposed
semi-supervised segmentation framework is a key contribution and applicable for
biomedical image segmentation across various imaging modalities where access to

One of the most common techniques to improve the efficacy of such systems in
new domains involves collecting large labeled datasets, but such datasets can

requires additional data with expensive 3D bounding box annotations. We
demonstrate that pseudo-labeling for 3D object detection is an effective way to
exploit less expensive and more widely available unlabeled data, and can lead
to performance gains across various architectures, data augmentation
strategies, and sizes of the labeled dataset. Overall, we show that better
teacher models lead to better student models, and that we can distill expensive

  Specifically, we demonstrate that pseudo-label-trained student models can
outperform supervised models trained on 3-10 times the amount of labeled

model, we are able to achieve state of the art accuracy simply by leveraging
large quantities of pseudo-labeled data. Lastly, we show that these student

only have unlabeled data, making pseudo-label training an effective form of

realizable. A classical question of computational topology asked by Gauss
himself is which chords diagrams are realizable. An answer was first discovered
in the 1930s by Dehn, and since then many efficient algorithms for checking
realizability of Gauss diagrams have been developed. Recent studies in
Grinblat-Lopatkin (2018,2020) and Biryukov (2019) formulated especially simple
conditions related to realizability which are expressible in terms of parity of
chords intersections. The simple form of these conditions opens an opportunity
for experimental investigation of Gauss diagrams using constraint satisfaction
and related techniques. In this paper we report on our experiments with Gauss
diagrams of small sizes (up to 11 chords) using implementations of these
conditions and other algorithms in logic programming language Prolog. In
particular, we found a series of counterexamples showing that that
realizability criteria established by Grinblat and Lopatkin (2018,2020) and
Biryukov (2019) are not completely correct.

investigate the optimal delay scheme with the largest spectrum efficiency of
DBICM for a fixed maximum number of delayed time slots and a given

important properties: the capacity improvement due to delayed coded bits being
mapped to the real and imaginary parts of the transmitted symbols are
independent of each other; a pair of delay schemes with delayed coded bits
having identical bit-channel capacity lead to equivalent DBICM capacity. Using
these two properties, we efficiently optimize the delay scheme for any uniform

designs regarding unequal error protection via bit-channel type

transfer charts to jointly optimize degree distributions and channel

congestion in urban traffic networks. Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms
have proved themselves to be able to find high-quality signal timing plans.
However, they generally suffer from performance deterioration when solving
large-scale traffic signal optimization problems due to the huge search space
and limited computational budget. Directing against this issue, this study
proposes a surrogate-assisted cooperative signal optimization (SCSO) method.
Different from existing methods that directly deal with the entire traffic
network, SCSO first decomposes it into a set of tractable sub-networks, and
then achieves signal setting by cooperatively optimizing these sub-networks
with a surrogate-assisted optimizer. The decomposition operation significantly
narrows the search space of the whole traffic network, and the
surrogate-assisted optimizer greatly lowers the computational burden by
reducing the number of expensive traffic simulations. By taking Newman fast
algorithm, radial basis function and a modified estimation of distribution
algorithm as decomposer, surrogate model and optimizer, respectively, this
study develops a concrete SCSO algorithm. To evaluate its effectiveness and
efficiency, a large-scale traffic network involving crossroads and T-junctions
is generated based on a real traffic network. Comparison with several existing
meta-heuristic algorithms specially designed for traffic signal optimization
demonstrates the superiority of SCSO in reducing the average delay time of
vehicles.

the Pantheon sample, the largest compilation of SNe Ia, into 3, 4, 20 and 40

$\Omega_{0m}^{\Lambda CDM}=0.298$ and $\Omega_{0m}^{w_{0}w_{a}CDM}=0.308$.
  We find that $H_0$ evolves with redshift, showing a slowly decreasing trend,
with $\alpha$ coefficients consistent with zero only from 1.2 to 2.0 $\sigma$.
Although the $\alpha$ coefficients are compatible with 0 in 3 $\sigma$, this
however may affect cosmological results. We measure locally a variation of
$H_0(z=0)-H_0(z=1)=0.4\, \textrm{km s}^{-1}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in 3 and 4

investigated. Thus, we have reduced the $H_0$ tension from $54\%$ to $72\%$ for

motion-blurred facial images. This paper introduce the processing progress of
motion-blurred images, the development and changes of GANs and some basic
concepts. After that, it give the details of network structure and training
optimization design of the image processor. Then we conducted a motion blur
image generation experiment on some general facial data set, and used the pairs
of blurred and sharp face image data to perform the training and testing
experiments of the processor GAN, and gave some visual displays. Finally, MTCNN
is used to detect the faces of the image generated by the deblurring processor,
and compare it with the result of the blurred image. From the results, the
processing effect of the deblurring processor on the motion-blurred picture has
a significant improvement both in terms of intuition and evaluation indicators
of face detection.

dwarf systems in nearby clusters and groups shows that, within the
uncertainties, the rate at which the probability of nucleation varies with
galaxy luminosity is nearly universal. On the other hand, the fraction of
nucleated galaxies at fixed luminosity does exhibit an environmental
dependence. More massive environments feature higher nucleation fractions and
fainter values of the half-nucleation luminosity, which roughly scales with
host halo virial mass as $L_{I,f_{n50}} \propto \mathcal{M}_{200}^{-0.2}$. Our
results reinforce the role of galaxy luminosity/mass as a major driver of the

and the decision maker requires an online learning approach to optimize its
strategy in response to the changing environment. When the loss and constraint
functions are convex, this belongs to the general family of online convex
optimization (OCO). In existing OCO works, the environment is assumed to vary
in a time-slotted fashion, while the decisions are updated at each time slot.
However, many wireless communication systems permit only periodic decision
updates, i.e., each decision is fixed over multiple time slots, while the
environment changes between the decision epochs. The standard OCO model is
inadequate for these systems. Therefore, in this work, we consider periodic
decision updates for OCO. We aim to minimize the accumulation of time-varying
convex loss functions, subject to both short-term and long-term constraints.
Information about the loss functions within the current update period may be
incomplete and is revealed to the decision maker only after the decision is
made. We propose an efficient algorithm, termed Periodic Queueing and Gradient
Aggregation (PQGA), which employs novel periodic queues together with possibly
multi-step aggregated gradient descent to update the decisions over time. We
derive upper bounds on the dynamic regret, static regret, and constraint
violation of PQGA. As an example application, we study the performance of PQGA
in a large-scale multi-antenna system shared by multiple wireless service
providers. Simulation results show that PQGA converges fast and substantially
outperforms the known best alternative.

reinforcement learning and evolutionary optimisation algorithms, at a vast
computation cost. Even recent differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS)
samples a small number of candidate neural architectures based on the
probability distribution of learned architecture parameters to select the final
neural architecture. To address this computational complexity issue, we
introduce a novel \emph{architecture parameterisation} based on scaled sigmoid

evaluate candidate neural networks. Specifically, for stochastic supernets as
well as conventional CNNs, we build a new channel-wise module layer with the
architecture components controlled by a scaled sigmoid function. We train these
neural network models from scratch. The network optimization is decoupled into
the weight optimization and the architecture optimization. We address the
non-convex optimization problem of neural architecture by the continuous scaled
sigmoid method with convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our DNAL method delivers superior performance in terms of neural architecture

The in situ Fe charge states are found to cluster around $\rm Fe^{10+}$,
independently of the 300 to 700 km $\rm s^{-1}$ stream speeds, referred to as
the continual solar wind. $\rm Fe^{10+}$ thus yields the fiducial link between
the continual solar wind and its $\rm T_{fexi}$ sources at the Sun. While the
spatial distribution of Fe XIV emission, from $\rm Fe^{13+}$, associated with

the output of a network as a pseudo-label for subsequent loss calculations. In

investigating a more intelligent Fog-RAN to assist the communication in a

Specifically, we dynamically optimize the power allocation in the remote radio

quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and channel variation. The impact of
caching on the power allocation is considered. The dynamic power optimization
is analyzed to obtain a closed-form solution in certain cases. The inherent

this paper, we propose an open-source OpenAI Gym-like environment for multiple
quadcopters based on the Bullet physics engine. Its multi-agent and vision

interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful,
it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and
space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and
space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax
function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a
drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a
straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating
mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate
that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer
baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as
a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA
is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text
classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are
especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly
useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or

deep learning-based methods have been shown to produce superior performance on
MR image reconstruction. However, these methods require large amounts of data
which is difficult to collect and share due to the high cost of acquisition and
medical data privacy regulations. In order to overcome this challenge, we
propose a federated learning (FL) based solution in which we take advantage of
the MR data available at different institutions while preserving patients'
privacy. However, the generalizability of models trained with the FL setting
can still be suboptimal due to domain shift, which results from the data
collected at multiple institutions with different sensors, disease types, and
acquisition protocols, etc. With the motivation of circumventing this
challenge, we propose a cross-site modeling for MR image reconstruction in
which the learned intermediate latent features among different source sites are
aligned with the distribution of the latent features at the target site.
Extensive experiments are conducted to provide various insights about FL for MR
image reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework is a promising direction to utilize multi-institutional data without
compromising patients' privacy for achieving improved MR image reconstruction.

of feature diversity for final judgment. In our method, we propose to
dynamically suppress significant activation values of CNN by group-wise
inhibition, but not fixedly or randomly handle them when training. The feature
maps with different activation distribution are then processed separately to
take the feature independence into account. CNN is finally guided to learn
richer discriminative features hierarchically for robust classification

learning techniques were proposed to monitor driver fatigue, especially in
manual driving, little is known about how these black-box machine learning
models work. In this paper, we proposed a combination of eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to predict driver
fatigue with explanations due to their efficiency and accuracy. First, in order
to obtain the ground truth of driver fatigue, PERCLOS (percentage of eyelid
closure over the pupil over time) between 0 and 100 was used as the response
variable. Second, we built a driver fatigue regression model using both
physiological and behavioral measures with XGBoost and it outperformed other
selected machine learning models with 3.847 root-mean-squared error (RMSE),
1.768 mean absolute error (MAE) and 0.996 adjusted $R^2$. Third, we employed
SHAP to identify the most important predictor variables and uncovered the
black-box XGBoost model by showing the main effects of most important predictor
variables globally and explaining individual predictions locally. Such an
explainable driver fatigue prediction model offered insights into how to
intervene in automated driving when necessary, such as during the takeover
transition period from automated driving to manual driving.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel generative model, which tracks
the transition of latent clusters, instead of isolated feature representations,
to achieve robust modeling. It is characterized by a newly designed dynamic
Gaussian mixture distribution, which captures the dynamics of clustering
structures, and is used for emitting timeseries. The generative model is
parameterized by neural networks. A structured inference network is also
designed for enabling inductive analysis. A gating mechanism is further
introduced to dynamically tune the Gaussian mixture distributions. Extensive

electrochemical model for NMC-graphite Li-ion battery was developed to
investigate its calendar loss behavior. Various factors affecting the calendar
loss of the NMC-graphite batteries were systematically investigated, with the
results validated with experimental data of a Sanyo 18,650 cylindrical cell. It
was found that at 25 o C working temperature and 100% SOC, the capacity drops
6.4% of its original capacity after 10 months. Also, when the anode particle
size decreases from 26.2 {\mu}m to 6.55 {\mu}m, the capacity drop ratio is over
22% after 10 months under the same operation condition. Our simulation results
demonstrate that a smaller SOC, a lower cell working temperature and a larger

NMC-graphite Li-ion batteries, and serve as a robust reference for the battery

of photons is no longer conserved, but the energy of photons could remain
conserved. We discuss the conditions for the energy conservation of photons in

photon decoupling to the present day, are obtained in the context of RVMs by
assuming that photons and baryons can be coupled to running vacuum,
respectively. Both cases lead to a time-evolving baryon-to-photon ratio.
However the evolution of the baryon-to-photon ratio is strictly constrained by
observations. It is found that if the dynamic term of running vacuum is indeed
coupled to photons or baryons, the coefficient of the dynamic term must be
extremely small, which is unnatural. Therefore, our study basically rules out

processing delays and enhanced computational complexity. As the resources at
the MEC and intelligent terminals are limited, performing reasonable resource
allocation optimization can improve the performance, especially for a
multi-terminals offloading system. In this study, to minimize the task
computation delay, we jointly optimize the local content splitting ratio, the
transmission/computation power allocation, and the MEC server selection under a
dynamic environment with stochastic task arrivals. The challenging dynamic
joint optimization problem is formulated as a reinforcement learning (RL)
problem, which is designed as the computational offloading policies to minimize
the long-term average delay cost. Two deep RL strategies, deep Q-learning

learn the computational offloading policies adaptively and efficiently. The
proposed DQN strategy takes the MEC selection as a unique action while using
the convex optimization approach to obtain the local content splitting ratio

of the DDPG strategy are selected as all dynamic variables, including the local

non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which reduce transmission rates
without medical actions, are being implemented around the world to mitigate
spreads. One of the problems in assessing the effects of NPIs is that different
NPIs have been implemented at different times based on the situation of each
country; therefore, few assumptions can be shared about how the introduction of
policies affects the patient population. Mathematical models can contribute to
further understanding these phenomena by obtaining analytical solutions as well
as numerical simulations. In this study, an NPI was introduced into the SIR
model for a conceptual study of infectious diseases under the condition that
the transmission rate was reduced to a fixed value only once within a finite
time duration, and its effect was analyzed numerically and theoretically. It
was analytically shown that the maximum fraction of infected individuals and
the final size could be larger if the intervention starts too early. The
analytical results also suggested that more individuals may be infected at the
peak of the second wave with a stronger intervention. This study provides
quantitative relationship between the strength of a one-shot intervention and
the reduction in the number of patients with no approximation. This suggests
the importance of the strength and time of NPIs, although detailed studies are
necessary for the implementation of NPIs in complicated real-world environments
as the model used in this study is based on various simplifications.

pose problems with orchestration and efficient scheduling. The compute
architectures at these facilities do not easily support the Python compute

requires expertise in multiple job scheduling services. The combination of the
pure-Python libraries pyhf and funcX reduces the common problem in HEP analyses
of performing statistical inference with binned models, that would
traditionally take multiple hours and bespoke scheduling, to an on-demand
(fitting) ""function as a service"" that can scalably execute across workers in
just a few minutes, offering reduced time to insight and inference. We
demonstrate execution of a scalable workflow using funcX to simultaneously fit
125 signal hypotheses from a published ATLAS search for new physics using pyhf
with a wall time of under 3 minutes. We additionally show performance
comparisons for other physics analyses with openly published probability models
and argue for a blueprint of fitting as a service systems at HPC centers.

robotics. Most of the current methods either generate grasp poses with few DoF
that fail to cover most of the success grasps, or only take the unstable depth
image or point cloud as input which may lead to poor results in some cases. In
this paper, we propose RGBD-Grasp, a pipeline that solves this problem by
decoupling 7-DoF grasp detection into two sub-tasks where RGB and depth
information are processed separately. In the first stage, an encoder-decoder
like convolutional neural network Angle-View Net(AVN) is proposed to predict
the SO(3) orientation of the gripper at every location of the image.
Consequently, a Fast Analytic Searching(FAS) module calculates the opening
width and the distance of the gripper to the grasp point. By decoupling the
grasp detection problem and introducing the stable RGB modality, our pipeline
alleviates the requirement for the high-quality depth image and is robust to
depth sensor noise. We achieve state-of-the-art results on GraspNet-1Billion

have a strong bias towards seen classes during training. Meta-learning has been

we propose a novel Task-aligned Generative Meta-learning model for Zero-shot

TGMZ incorporates an attribute-conditioned task-wise distribution alignment

In a situation where head rotates, eye-gaze is subject to both behaviors of
saccade and head rotation. However, existing methods of eye-gaze estimation did
not work reliably, since the listener's strategy of eye-gaze varies and
measurements of the two behaviors were not properly combined. Besides, existing

conducted. We used horizontal electrooculography (HEOG) and neck

  Question/Problem: This research aims to draw attention to the need for
considering the interrelated effects of confidence and knowledge on
requirements quality, which has not been addressed by previous publications.
  Principal ideas/results: For this purpose, the following steps have been
taken: 1) requirements quality was defined based on the instructions provided
by the ISO29148:2011 standard, 2) we selected the symptoms of low qualified
requirements based on ISO29148:2011, 3) we analyzed five Software Requirements
Specification (SRS) documents to find these symptoms, 3) people who have
prepared the documents were categorized in four classes to specify the
more/less knowledge and confidence they have regarding the symptoms, and 4)
finally, the relation of lack of enough knowledge and confidence to symptoms of
low quality was investigated. The results revealed that the simultaneous
deficiency of confidence and knowledge has more negative effects in comparison
with a deficiency of knowledge or confidence.
  Contribution: In brief, this study has achieved these results: 1) the
realization that a combined lack of knowledge and confidence has a larger
effect on requirements quality than only one of the two factors, 2) the
relation between low qualified requirements and requirements engineers' needs

proposed the Algebraic Symmetrically Quantized GSK (A-SQGSK) protocol for a

A-SQGSK protocol guarantees confidentiality of common randomness to an
eavesdropper, we observe that the key-rate of the protocol is poor since only
one channel in the network is used to harvest GSK. Identifying this limitation,

tracking the {\em inverse} of the circuit's stabilizer tableau. Second, Stim
improves the constant factors of the algorithm by using a cache-friendly data
layout and 256 bit wide SIMD instructions. Third, Stim only uses expensive
stabilizer tableau simulation to create an initial reference sample. Further
samples are collected in bulk by using that sample as a reference for batches
of Pauli frames propagating through the circuit.

  Schemes for Reversible-Irreversible Thermodynamically Consistent Models: Part
  I Incompressible Hydrodynamic Models",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a general numerical platform for designing
accurate, efficient, and stable numerical algorithms for incompressible
hydrodynamic models that obeys the thermodynamical laws. The obtained numerical
schemes are automatically linear in time. It decouples the hydrodynamic
variable and other state variables such that only small-size linear problems
need to be solved at each time marching step. Furthermore, if the classical
velocity projection method is utilized, the velocity field and pressure field
can be decoupled. In the end, only a few elliptic-type equations shall be
solved in each time step. This strategy is made possible through a sequence of
model reformulations by fully exploring the models' thermodynamic structures.
The generalized Onsager principle directly guides these reformulation
procedures. In the reformulated but equivalent models, the reversible and
irreversible components can be identified, guiding the numerical platform to
decouple the reversible and irreversible dynamics. This eventually leads to
decoupled numerical algorithms, given that the coupling terms only involve
irreversible dynamics. To further demonstrate the numerical platform's power,
we apply it to several specific incompressible hydrodynamic models. The energy
stability of the proposed numerical schemes is shown in detail. The
second-order accuracy in time is verified numerically through time step
refinement tests. Several benchmark numerical examples are presented to further
illustrate the proposed numerical framework's accuracy, stability, and
efficiency.

presentation attacks made by artificially generated spoof fingerprints.
Therefore, it is essential to perform liveness detection of a fingerprint
before authenticating it. Fingerprint liveness detection mechanisms perform
well under the within-dataset environment but fail miserably under cross-sensor
(when tested on a fingerprint acquired by a new sensor) and cross-dataset (when
trained on one dataset and tested on another) settings. To enhance the
generalization abilities, robustness and the interoperability of the
fingerprint spoof detectors, the learning models need to be adaptive towards
the data. We propose a generic model, EaZy learning which can be considered as
an adaptive midway between eager and lazy learning. We show the usefulness of
this adaptivity under cross-sensor and cross-dataset environments. EaZy
learning examines the properties intrinsic to the dataset while generating a
pool of hypotheses. EaZy learning is similar to ensemble learning as it
generates an ensemble of base classifiers and integrates them to make a
prediction. Still, it differs in the way it generates the base classifiers.
EaZy learning develops an ensemble of entirely disjoint base classifiers which
has a beneficial influence on the diversity of the underlying ensemble. Also,
it integrates the predictions made by these base classifiers based on their
performance on the validation data. Experiments conducted on the standard high
dimensional datasets LivDet 2011, LivDet 2013 and LivDet 2015 prove the
efficacy of the model under cross-dataset and cross-sensor environments.

building blocks of hydrodynamic phase-field models for multiphase fluid flow
dynamics. Due to the coupling between the Navier-Stokes equation and the
Cahn-Hilliard equation, the CHNS system is non-trivial to solve numerically.
Traditionally, a numerical extrapolation for the coupling terms is used.
However, such brute-force extrapolation usually destroys the intrinsic
thermodynamic structures of this CHNS system. This paper proposes a new
strategy to reformulate the CHNS system into a constraint gradient flow
formation. Under the new formulation, the reversible and irreversible
structures are clearly revealed. This guides us to propose operator splitting
schemes. The operator splitting schemes have several advantageous properties.
First of all, the proposed schemes lead to several decoupled systems in smaller
sizes to be solved at each time marching step. This significantly reduces
computational costs. Secondly, the proposed schemes still guarantee the
thermodynamic laws of the CHNS system at the discrete level. It ensures the
thermodynamic laws, accuracy, and stability for the numerical solutions. In
addition, unlike the recently populated IEQ or SAV approach using auxiliary
variables, our resulting energy laws are formulated in the original variables.
Our proposed framework lays out a foundation to design decoupled and energy
stable numerical algorithms for hydrodynamic phase-field models. Furthermore,
given different splitting steps, various numerical algorithms can be obtained,
making this framework rather general. The proposed numerical algorithms are
implemented. Their second-order accuracy in time is verified numerically. Some
numerical examples and benchmark problems are calculated to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

multi-choice questions (e.g. Do you like Bulbasaur? Y/N; do you like Squirtle?
Y/N), peer prediction aims to design mechanisms that encourage honest feedback
without verification. A series of works have successfully designed multi-task
peer prediction mechanisms where reporting truthfully is better than any other
strategy (dominantly truthful), while they require an infinite number of tasks.
A recent work proposes the first multi-task peer prediction mechanism,
Determinant Mutual Information (DMI)-Mechanism, where not only is dominantly
truthful but also works for a finite number of tasks (practical). However, the
existence of other practical dominantly-truthful multi-task peer prediction
mechanisms remains to be an open question. This work answers the above question
by providing 1. a new family of information-monotone information measures:
volume mutual information (VMI), where DMI is a special case; 2. a new family
of practical dominantly-truthful multi-task peer prediction mechanisms,
VMI-Mechanisms. To illustrate the importance of VMI-Mechanisms, we also provide
a tractable effort incentive optimization goal. We show that DMI-Mechanism may
not be not optimal but we can construct a sequence of VMI-Mechanisms that are
approximately optimal. The main technical highlight in this paper is a novel
geometric information measure, Volume Mutual Information, that is based on a
simple idea: we can measure an object A's information amount by the number of
objects that is less informative than A. Different densities over the object
lead to different information measures. This also gives Determinant Mutual
Information a simple geometric interpretation.

from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain for
cross-modality biomedical image segmentation. Specifically, our approach
consists of two key modules, a conditional domain discriminator~(CDD) and a
category-centric prototype aligner~(CCPA). The CDD, extended from conditional
domain adversarial networks in classifier tasks, is effective and robust in
handling complex cross-modality biomedical images. The CCPA, improved from the
graph-induced prototype alignment mechanism in cross-domain object detection,
can exploit precise instance-level features through an elaborate prototype
representation. In addition, it can address the negative effect of class
imbalance via entropy-based loss. Extensive experiments on a public benchmark
for the cardiac substructure segmentation task demonstrate that our method
significantly improves performance on the target domain.

In particular, $QQ\bar q\bar q$ tetraquarks with double heavy flavor become

latent dynamics and returns separately in value estimation. Further, we derive
a practical deep RL algorithm, consisting of a convolutional model to learn

create profitable DeFi trades, one well-suited to arbitrage and the other
applicable to more complicated settings. We first adopt the Bellman-Ford-Moore
algorithm with DEFIPOSER-ARB and then create logical DeFi protocol models for a
theorem prover in DEFIPOSER-SMT. While DEFIPOSER-ARB focuses on DeFi
transactions that form a cycle and performs very well for arbitrage,
DEFIPOSER-SMT can detect more complicated profitable transactions. We estimate
that DEFIPOSER-ARB and DEFIPOSER-SMT can generate an average weekly revenue of
191.48ETH (76,592USD) and 72.44ETH (28,976USD) respectively, with the highest
transaction revenue being 81.31ETH(32,524USD) and22.40ETH (8,960USD)
respectively. We further show that DEFIPOSER-SMT finds the known economic bZx
attack from February 2020, which yields 0.48M USD. Our forensic investigations
show that this opportunity existed for 69 days and could have yielded more
revenue if exploited one day earlier. Our evaluation spans 150 days, given 96
DeFi protocol actions, and 25 assets.
  Looking beyond the financial gains mentioned above, forks deteriorate the
blockchain consensus security, as they increase the risks of double-spending
and selfish mining. We explore the implications of DEFIPOSER-ARB and
DEFIPOSER-SMT on blockchain consensus. Specifically, we show that the trades
identified by our tools exceed the Ethereum block reward by up to 874x. Given
optimal adversarial strategies provided by a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we
quantify the value threshold at which a profitable transaction qualifies as
Miner ExtractableValue (MEV) and would incentivize MEV-aware miners to fork the
blockchain. For instance, we find that on Ethereum, a miner with a hash rate of
10% would fork the blockchain if an MEV opportunity exceeds 4x the block
reward.

mechanization has proven to be group affine, which means that the corresponding
vector error state model will be trajectory-independent. In order to make use
of the transformed INS mechanization in inertial based integration, both the
right and left vector error state models are derived. The INS/GPS and
INS/Odometer integration are investigated as two representatives of inertial
based integration. Some application aspects of the derived error state models
in the two applications are presented, which include how to select the error
state model, initialization of the SE2(3) based error state covariance and
feedback correction corresponding to the error state definitions. Extensive
Monte Carlo simulations and land vehicle experiments are conducted to evaluate
the performance of the derived error state models. It is shown that the most
striking superiority of using the derived error state models is their ability
to handle the large initial attitude misalignments, which is just the result of
log-linearity property of the derived error state models. Therefore, the
derived error state models can be used in the so-called attitude alignment for
the two applications. Moreover, the derived right error state-space model is
also very preferred for long-endurance INS/Odometer integration due to the
filtering consistency caused by its less dependence on the global state
estimate.

however, commonly employed techniques suffer from difficulties rooted either in
the physics of these systems, or of technical nature. The very large exciton

atomically thin crystals makes the use of conventional scanning tunneling
spectroscopy cumbersome. Ionic gate spectroscopy is a newly developed technique
that exploits ionic gate field-effect transistors to determine quantitatively
the relative alignment of band edges of two-dimensional semiconductors in a
straightforward way, directly from transport measurements (i.e., from the
transistor electrical characteristics). The technique relies on the extremely
large geometrical capacitance of ionic gated devices that -- under suitable

shift in chemical potential. Here we present an overview of ionic gate
spectroscopy, and illustrate its relevance with applications to different

halo mass function (HMF), the equation of state (EOS) of the IGM, and the
cosmic star formation history (SFH). Consistent with previous work, we find a
freeze-out in the HMF at $z\approx-0.6$. The evolution of the EOS of the IGM
presents an interesting case study of the cosmological coincidence problem,
where there is a sharp decline in the IGM temperature immediately after $z=0$.
For the SFH, the simulations produce a peak and a subsequent decline into the
future. However, we do find a turnaround in the SFH after $z\approx-0.98$ in
some simulations, probably due to the limitations of the criteria used for star
formation. By integrating the SFH in time up to $z=-0.92$, the simulation with
the best spatial resolution predicts an asymptotic total stellar mass that is
very close to that obtained from extrapolating the fit of the observed SFR.
Lastly, we investigate the future evolution of the partition of baryons within
a Milky Way-sized galaxy, using both a zoom and a box simulation. Despite
vastly different resolutions, these simulations predict individual haloes
containing an equal fraction of baryons in stars and gas at the time of
freeze-out ($t\approx30\,{\rm Gyr}$).

in solids. Any local interactions can be expressed as the product of two
multipole operators, and the interaction parameters are systematically
classified based on the point group symmetry. The form of the multipole
interactions are restricted not only by the symmetry and Hermiticity but also
by the spatial structure of the interaction, which is closely related to the
presence or absence of the odd-rank multipoles. As an exemplary demonstration,
the screened Coulomb interaction for SrVO$_3$ is considered, where only a few
parameters are necessary for its description. By comparing it with the
unscreened version, the totally symmetric $A_1$ representation is found to be
strongly suppressed, but the $A_1$ component still gives a dominant
contribution for the anisotropic part of the interaction. The anisotropic

which give the same-order contribution as the one-body level splitting
estimated by the band structure calculation.

designed for 6D pose estimation from a single RGBD image. Our key insight is
that appearance information in the RGB image and geometry information from the
depth image are two complementary data sources, and it still remains unknown
how to fully leverage them. Towards this end, we propose FFB6D, which learns to
combine appearance and geometry information for representation learning as well
as output representation selection. Specifically, at the representation
learning stage, we build bidirectional fusion modules in the full flow of the
two networks, where fusion is applied to each encoding and decoding layer. In
this way, the two networks can leverage local and global complementary
information from the other one to obtain better representations. Moreover, at
the output representation stage, we designed a simple but effective 3D
keypoints selection algorithm considering the texture and geometry information
of objects, which simplifies keypoint localization for precise pose estimation.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by

spacetime-varying motions that are incessantly changing across both space and
time. Prior methods mainly capture the temporal state transitions but overlook
the complex spatiotemporal variations of the motion itself, making them
difficult to adapt to ever-changing motions. We observe that physical world
motions can be decomposed into transient variation and motion trend, while the
latter can be regarded as the accumulation of previous motions. Thus,
simultaneously capturing the transient variation and the motion trend is the
key to make spacetime-varying motions more predictable. Based on these
observations, we propose the MotionRNN framework, which can capture the complex
variations within motions and adapt to spacetime-varying scenarios. MotionRNN
has two main contributions. The first is that we design the MotionGRU unit,
which can model the transient variation and motion trend in a unified way. The
second is that we apply the MotionGRU to RNN-based predictive models and
indicate a new flexible video prediction architecture with a Motion Highway
that can significantly improve the ability to predict changeable motions and
avoid motion vanishing for stacked multiple-layer predictive models. With high
flexibility, this framework can adapt to a series of models for deterministic
spatiotemporal prediction. Our MotionRNN can yield significant improvements on
three challenging benchmarks for video prediction with spacetime-varying
motions.

  Learning using Feature Dictionary","Under review",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The key challenge of unsupervised vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is
learning discriminative features from unlabelled vehicle images. Numerous
methods using domain adaptation have achieved outstanding performance, but
those methods still need a labelled dataset as a source domain. This paper
addresses an unsupervised vehicle Re-ID method, which no need any types of a
labelled dataset, through a Self-supervised Metric Learning (SSML) based on a
feature dictionary. Our method initially extracts features from vehicle images
and stores them in a dictionary. Thereafter, based on the dictionary, the
proposed method conducts dictionary-based positive label mining (DPLM) to
search for positive labels. Pair-wise similarity, relative-rank consistency,
and adjacent feature distribution similarity are jointly considered to find
images that may belong to the same vehicle of a given probe image. The results
of DPLM are applied to dictionary-based triplet loss (DTL) to improve the
discriminativeness of learnt features and to refine the quality of the results
of DPLM progressively. The iterative process with DPLM and DTL boosts the
performance of unsupervised vehicle Re-ID. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method by producing promising vehicle Re-ID
performance without a pre-labelled dataset. The source code for this paper is

amplitude which reflects a Cooper pairing at different time. The self-energy of
bogolons is mainly contributed by the disorder effects in the low frequency
limit as in the usual electron liquid. Depending on the choice of the
parameters, there are two kinds of solutions: one is frequency-independent (but
with sign function of frequency) and the other is proportional to the inverse
of the frequency, which exist in both the normal and anomalous parts of the
self-energy. These characteristic self-energy structures are clearly reflected
in the single-particle spectrum. Since the bogolons are originally composed of
electrons, the connection between the two is also sought using the concrete
$j=3/2$ fermion model, which reveals that the odd-frequency pairing of bogolons

product development. Some great approaches have been proposed to identify these

with specific templates and/or depend on other external source which is often
uneasy to build for lots of projects in practice. Objective: We aim to propose
an approach Finer Semantic Analysis-based Requirements Conflict Detector
(FSARC) to automatically detecting the conflicts between the given natural
language functional requirements by analyzing their finer semantic
compositions. Method: We build a harmonized semantic meta-model of functional
requirements with the form of eight-tuple. Then we propose algorithms to
automatically analyze the linguistic features of requirements and to annotate
the semantic elements for their semantic model construction. And we define
seven types of conflicts as long as their heuristic detecting rules on the
ground of their text pattern and semantical dependency. Finally, we design and
implement the algorithm for conflicts detection. Results: The experiment with
four requirement datasets illustrates that the recall of FSARC is nearly 100%
and the average precision is 83.88% on conflicts detection. Conclusion: We
provide a useful tool for detecting the conflicts between natural language
functional requirements to improve the quality of the final requirements set.
Besides, our approach is capable of transforming the natural language
functional requirements into eight semantic tuples, which is useful not only
the detection of the conflicts between requirements but also some other tasks

improve their business goal. By deploying computation-intensive models and
algorithms, these systems are able to inference user interests and exhibit
certain ads or commodities from the candidate set to maximize their business
goals. However, such systems are facing two challenges in achieving their
goals. On the one hand, facing massive online requests, computation-intensive
models and algorithms are pushing their computation resources to the limit. On
the other hand, the response time of these systems is strictly limited to a
short period, e.g. 300 milliseconds in our real system, which is also being
exhausted by the increasingly complex models and algorithms.
  In this paper, we propose the computation resource allocation solution (CRAS)
that maximizes the business goal with limited computation resources and
response time. We comprehensively illustrate the problem and formulate such a
problem as an optimization problem with multiple constraints, which could be
broken down into independent sub-problems. To solve the sub-problems, we
propose the revenue function to facilitate the theoretical analysis, and obtain
the optimal computation resource allocation strategy. To address the
applicability issues, we devise the feedback control system to help our
strategy constantly adapt to the changing online environment. The effectiveness
of our method is verified by extensive experiments based on the real dataset
from Taobao.com. We also deploy our method in the display advertising system of
Alibaba. The online results show that our computation resource allocation
solution achieves significant business goal improvement without any increment
of computation cost, which demonstrates the efficacy of our method in real
industrial practice.

autonomous vehicles. Semantic segmentation of 3d point clouds combines 3d
information with semantics and thereby provides a valuable contribution to this
task. In many real-world applications, point clouds are generated by lidar
sensors in a consecutive fashion. Working with a time series instead of single
and independent frames enables the exploitation of temporal information. We
therefore propose a recurrent segmentation architecture (RNN), which takes a
single range image frame as input and exploits recursively aggregated temporal
information. An alignment strategy, which we call Temporal Memory Alignment,
uses ego motion to temporally align the memory between consecutive frames in
feature space. A Residual Network and ConvGRU are investigated for the memory
update. We demonstrate the benefits of the presented approach on two
large-scale datasets and compare it to several stateof-the-art methods. Our
approach ranks first on the SemanticKITTI multiple scan benchmark and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the single scan benchmark. In addition, the
evaluation shows that the exploitation of temporal information significantly
improves segmentation results compared to a single frame approach.

source view image into a latent content code, and the decoder transforms it
into a target view image according to the condition. However, the source
contents are often not well kept in this setting, which leads to unnecessary
changes during the view translation. Although adding skipped connections, like
Unet, alleviates the problem, but it often causes the failure on the view
conformity. This paper proposes a new architecture by performing the
source-to-target deformation in an iterative way. Instead of simply
incorporating the features from multiple layers of the encoder, we design soft
and hard deformation modules, which warp the encoder features to the target
view at different resolutions, and give results to the decoder to complement
the details. Particularly, the current warping flow is not only used to align
the feature of the same resolution, but also as an approximation to coarsely
deform the high resolution feature. Then the residual flow is estimated and
applied in the high resolution, so that the deformation is built up in the
coarse-to-fine fashion. To better constrain the model, we synthesize a rough
target view image based on the intermediate flows and their warped features.
The extensive ablation studies and the final results on two different data sets
show the effectiveness of the proposed model.

spinorial formulations of GW-BSE have become available in different flavours in

hydrodynamic simulations in spherical symmetry with 21 progenitor models and a
hybrid equation of state (EoS) including hadrons and quarks. We find that the
effect of the PT on the CCSN postbounce dynamics is a function of the bounce
compactness parameter $\xi_{2.2}$. For $\xi_{2.2}\gtrsim0.24$, the PT leads to
a second dynamical collapse of the protocompact star (PCS). While BH formation
starts immediately after this second collapse for models with
$\xi_{2.2}\gtrsim0.51$, the PCS experiences a second bounce and oscillations
for models with $0.24\lesssim\xi_{2.2}\lesssim0.51$. These models emit potent
oscillatory neutrino signals with a period of $\sim$ms for tens of ms after the
second bounce, which can be a strong indicator of the PT in failing CCSNe if
detected in the future. However, no shock revival occurs and BH formation
inevitably takes place in our spherically-symmetric simulations. Furthermore,
via a diagram of mass-specific entropy evolution of the PCS, the progenitor
dependence can be understood through the appearance of third-family of compact
stars emerging at large entropy induced by the PT.

standard model independent cosmographic parameters to develop a new dynamical
system formulation of $f(R)$ gravity which is free from the limitation of
having to first specify the functional form of $f(R)$. By considering a set of
representative trajectories, which are indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM, we
use purely qualitative arguments to determine the extent to which these models
deviate from the standard model by including an analysis of the linear growth
rate of density fluctuations and also whether or not they suffer from the

higher risk that it suffers from a Dolgov-Kawasaki instability. Conversely, the

primarily focus on textual datasets used for ad-hoc search. This tool provides
both a Python and command line interface to numerous IR datasets and

Integrations with popular IR indexing and experimentation toolkits demonstrate
the tool's utility. We also provide documentation of these datasets through the

offline devices using Bluetooth and report an approximate location back to the

closed-source OF protocols by means of reverse engineering. We experimentally
show that unauthorized access to the location reports allows for accurate
device tracking and retrieving a user's top locations with an error in the

effective in a wide range of challenging decision making and control tasks.
However, these methods typically suffer from severe action oscillations in
particular in discrete action setting, which means that agents select different
actions within consecutive steps even though states only slightly differ. This
issue is often neglected since the policy is usually evaluated by its
cumulative rewards only. Action oscillation strongly affects the user
experience and can even cause serious potential security menace especially in
real-world domains with the main concern of safety, such as autonomous driving.
To this end, we introduce Policy Inertia Controller (PIC) which serves as a
generic plug-in framework to off-the-shelf DRL algorithms, to enables adaptive
trade-off between the optimality and smoothness of the learned policy in a
formal way. We propose Nested Policy Iteration as a general training algorithm

uses cluster k=3 and divides into three parts: background, eggs, and yolk. Egg
yolks are part of eggs that have embryonic characteristics. This study applies
the concept of color in the initial segmentation and grayscale in the final
stages. The initial phase results show that the image segmentation results
using k-means clustering based on Lab color space provide a grouping of three
parts. At the grayscale image processing stage, the results of color image
segmentation are processed with grayscaling, image enhancement, and morphology.
Thus, it seems clear that the yolk segmented shows the presence of egg embryos.
Based on this results, the initial stages of the embryo detection process used
K-means segmentation based on Lab color space. The evaluation uses MSE and
MSSIM, with values of 0.0486 and 0.9979; this can be used to reference that the

Two-dimensional halide perovskite such as (C_6H_5C_2H_4NH_3)_2PbI_4, or simply

interactions, making them attractive systems for further investigation. This
work reports tunable splitting of exciton modes in PEPI resulting from strong
light-matter interactions, manifested as multiple dips (modes) in the
reflection spectra. While the origin of the redder mode is well understood,
that for the bluer dip at room temperature is still lacking. Here, it is
revealed that the presence of the multiple modes originates from an indirect
coupling between excitons in different quantum wells. The long-range
characteristic of the mediated coupling between excitons in distant quantum
wells is also demonstrated in a structure design along with its tunability.
Moreover, a device architecture involving an end silver layer enhances the two
excitonic modes and provides further tunability. Importantly, this work will
motivate the possibility of coupling of the excitonic modes with a confined

report measurement of heat capacity of samples subject to large and highly

grows smoothly as a function of uniaxial pressure, favouring order parameters

communications ecosystems. We believe that, given the extremely tight
techno-economic constraints, such a revolutionary transition towards coherent
in short-reach first requires a very detailed study of its intrinsic
capabilities in largely extending the limitation currently imposed by direct
detection systems. To this end, this paper focuses on the ultimate physical
layer limitations of unamplified coherent systems in terms of bit rate and
power budget. The main parameters of our performance estimation model are
extracted through fitting with a set of experimental characterizations and
later used as the starting point of a scaling laws study regarding local
oscillator power, modulator-induced attenuation, bit rate, and maximum
achievable power budget. The analytically predicted performance is then
verified through transmission experiments, including a demonstration on a 37-km
installed metropolitan dark fiber in the city of Turin.

lowered water temperatures lead to higher flow rates, which requires higher
hydraulic capacity in terms of pipe and pump sizes. This increases the effect
of the already existing issue of hydraulic bottlenecks, causing peripheral
units (customers) to experience reduced flow rates. A coordinating control
strategy is presented in this work aimed at reducing the effect of such
bottlenecks on the comfort of customers. This is done by distributing the flow
deficit over many units rather than a few. Previous works mainly focus on
MPC-structured controllers that depend on complex system models and online
optimization techniques. This work proposes a method that requires little
information about models for individual units and minimal IT communication
between control systems. The proposed method is compared with a traditional
control strategy and an optimal baseline in a simulation study. This shows that
the proposed method can decrease the worst case indoor temperature deviations.

in operational terms. The result is a category-theoretic framework for
discussing the following general question: How do different implementations of
the same input-output process compare to each other? In the proposed framework,
an input-output process is modelled by a causally structured channel in some
fixed theory, and its implementations are modelled by causally structured
dilations formalising hidden side-computations. These dilations compare through
a pre-order formalising relative strength of side-computations. Chapter 1
reviews a mathematical model for physical theories as semicartesian symmetric
monoidal categories. Many concrete examples are discussed, in particular
quantum and classical information theory. The key feature is that the model
facilitates the notion of dilations. Chapter 2 is devoted to the study of
dilations. It introduces a handful of simple yet potent axioms about dilations,
one of which (resembling the Purification Postulate [CDP10]) entails a duality
theorem encompassing a large number of classic no-go results for quantum
theory. Chapter 3 considers metric structure on physical theories, introducing
in particular a new metric for quantum channels, the purified diamond distance,
which generalises the purified distance [TCR10,Tom12] and relates to the Bures
distance [KSW08a]. Chapter 4 presents a category-theoretic formalism for
causality in terms of '(constructible) causal channels' and 'contractions'. It
simplifies aspects of the formalisms [CDP09,KU17] and relates to traces in
monoidal categories [JSV96]. The formalism allows for the definition of 'causal
dilations' and the establishment of a non-trivial theory of such dilations.
Chapter 5 realises quantum self-testing from the perspective of chapter 4, thus
pointing towards the first known operational foundation for self-testing.

applications in human-robot interaction, virtual reality or life-logging
systems. Building action classifiers able to work for such heterogeneous action

actions from a given application but also large variations across domains (e.g.
virtual reality vs life-logging). This work introduces a novel skeleton-based
hand motion representation model that tackles this problem. The framework we
propose is agnostic to the application domain or camera recording view-point.
When working on a single domain (intra-domain action classification) our
approach performs better or similar to current state-of-the-art methods on
well-known hand action recognition benchmarks. And, more importantly, when
performing hand action recognition for action domains and camera perspectives
which our approach has not been trained for (cross-domain action
classification), our proposed framework achieves comparable performance to
intra-domain state-of-the-art methods. These experiments show the robustness

different stratification of the Lie algebra of Heisenberg groups. The crucial
feature of Rumin's complex is that $d_c$ is a differential operator of order 1
or 2 according to the degree of the form. Roughly speaking, Poincar\'e and
Sobolev type inequalities are quantitative formulations of the well known
topological problem whether a closed form is exact. More precisely, for
suitable $p$ and $q$, we mean that every exact differential form $\omega$ in

in the scalar case, when the degree of the forms $\omega$ is at least $2$, we
can take $q=\infty$ in the left-hand side of the inequality. The corresponding

space-time starting from a Weyl-invariant action principle in 4+K dimensions.
The Weyl invariance of Dirac's equation (and of Quantum Mechanics in general)
is made possible by observing that the difference between the Weyl and the
Riemann scalar curvatures in a metric space is coincident with Bohm's Quantum
potential. This circumstance allows a completely geometrical formulation of
Quantum Mechanics, the Conformal Quantum Geometrodynamics (CQG), which was
proved to be useful, for example, to clarify some aspects of the quantum
paradoxes and to simplify the demonstration of difficult theorems as the
Spin-Statistics connection. The present work extends our previous derivation of
Dirac's equation from the flat Minkowski space-time to a general curved
space-time. Charge and the e.m. fields are introduced by adding
extra-coordinates and then gauging the associated group symmetry. The resulting
Dirac's equation yields naturally to the correct gyromagnetic ratio $g_e=2$ for
the electron, but differs from the one derived in the Standard Quantum
Mechanics (SQM) in two respects. First, the coupling with the space-time
Riemann scalar curvature is found to be about 1/4 in the CQG instead of 1/2 as
in the SQM and, second, in the CQG result two very small additional terms
appear as scalar potentials acting on the particle. One depends on the
derivatives of the e.m. field tensor and the other is the scalar Kretschmann
term $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$. Both terms, not present in the
SQM, become appreciable only at distances of the order of the electron Compton
length or less. The Kretschmann term, in particular, is the only one surviving
in an external gravitational field obeying Einstein's equations in vacuum.
These small differences render the CQG theory confutable by very accurate
experiments, at least in principle.

adversarial training performs better than data augmentation with simple
Gaussian noise which has been observed to be a meaningful baseline on common

when Gaussian augmentation overfits to a particular standard deviation used for
training which has a significant detrimental effect on common corruption

enhance $\ell_p$ adversarial training by introducing an efficient relaxation of
adversarial training with learned perceptual image patch similarity as the

be axially loaded up to an arbitrary amount without distortion and then be
subject to incremental time-harmonic dynamic motion. At certain threshold
levels of axial load, the grillage manifests instabilities and displays
non-trivial axial and flexural incremental vibrations. Floquet-Bloch wave
asymptotics is used to homogenize the in-plane mechanical response, so to
obtain an equivalent prestressed elastic solid subject to incremental
time-harmonic vibration, which includes, as a particular case, the incremental
quasi-static response. The equivalent elastic solid is obtained from its
acoustic tensor, directly derived from homogenization and shown to be
independent of the rods' rotational inertia. Loss of strong ellipticity in the
equivalent continuum coincides with macro-bifurcation in the lattice, while
micro-bifurcation remains undetected in the continuum and corresponds to a
vibration of vanishing frequency of the lowest dispersion branch of the
lattice, occurring at finite wavelength. A perturbative approach based on
dynamic Green's function is applied to both the lattice and its equivalent
continuum. This shows that only macro-instability corresponds to localization
of incremental strain, while micro-instabilities occur in modes that spread
throughout the whole lattice with an 'explosive' character. Extremely localized
mechanical responses are found both in the lattice and in the solid, with the
advantage that the former can be easily realized, for instance via 3D printing.
In this way, features such as shear band inclination, or the emergence of a
single shear band, or competition between micro and macro instabilities become
all designable features. The presented results pave the way for the design of
architected materials to be used in applications involving extreme
deformations.

Examples of complex tasks include disaster relief rescue operations or project

whereby the composition of teams might change over time. We refer to this
process as self-organization. Second, the members of a team adapt to the
complex task environment by learning. There is, however, a lack of extensive
research on multi-level adaptation processes that consider self-organization
and individual learning as simultaneous processes in the field of management
science. We introduce an agent-based model based on the NK-framework to study
the effects of simultaneous multi-level adaptation on a team's performance. We
implement the multi-level adaptation process by a second-price auction
mechanism for self-organization at the team level. Adaptation at the individual

that, depending on the task's complexity, different configurations of
individual and collective adaptation can be associated with higher overall task
performance. Low complex tasks favour high individual and collective
adaptation, while moderate individual and collective adaptation is associated
with better performance in case of moderately complex tasks. For highly complex

the superposed data at the receiver side, we propose a family of data detectors

multi-user NOMA, in which randomly distributed users get grouped into narrow
cell sectors and are allocated different power levels depending on their
proximity to the base station. We show that successive interference
cancellation is carried with minimal performance and complexity costs under
spatial tuning. We derive approximate bit error rate (BER) equations, and we
propose an architectural design to illustrate complexity reductions. Under
typical THz conditions, channel puncturing introduces more than an order of
magnitude reduction in BER at high signal-to-noise ratios while reducing

explanations of the system's behavior. A prominent and intuitive type of
explanations are counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations
explain a behavior to the user by proposing actions -- as changes to the input
-- that would cause a different (specified) behavior of the system. However,
such explanation methods can be unstable with respect to small changes to the
input -- i.e. even a small change in the input can lead to huge or arbitrary
changes in the output and of the explanation. This could be problematic for
counterfactual explanations, as two similar individuals might get very
different explanations. Even worse, if the recommended actions differ
considerably in their complexity, one would consider such unstable
(counterfactual) explanations as individually unfair.
  In this work, we formally and empirically study the robustness of
counterfactual explanations in general, as well as under different models and
different kinds of perturbations. Furthermore, we propose that plausible
counterfactual explanations can be used instead of closest counterfactual
explanations to improve the robustness and consequently the individual fairness

including IT, DRT, ET and EIT. The state of MDR, the ultimate state of DRT
induced by adding polymers to Newtonian IT, is recently regarded as EIT. This
letter quantitatively demonstrates the role of IT and EIT in DRT via the
contributions of RSS and the nonlinear part of ESS to flow drag. The nature of
DRT is re-examined in a wide range of flow conditions covering a series of flow
regimes from the onset of DR to MDR. We argue that EIT related dynamics appears
in DRT long before settling to MDR regime and competitively coexists with IT in
both spatial and temporal domain at moderate and high Re. More specifically, at
low DR condition, EIT firstly emerges close to the channel walls. With the
increase of elasticity, low-drag EIT gradually replaces high-drag IT from
channel walls to center, resulting in a drastic decrease of flow drag comparing
with IT. When EIT dynamics dominates the whole channel, MDR phenomenon is
formed. Our findings provide evidences that DRT phenomenon is the result of IT

recognisable, irreducible Pisot random substitutions, we show that the
associated subshift is not topologically mixing. Without recognisability, we
rely on more specialised methods for excluding mixing and we apply these
methods to show that the random Fibonacci substitution subshift is not
topologically mixing.

FSDR has two unique features: 1) it decomposes images into DIFs and DVFs which
allows explicit access and manipulation of them and more controllable
randomization; 2) it has minimal effects on semantic structures of images and
domain-invariant features. We examined domain variance and invariance property
of FCs statistically and designed a network that can identify and fuse DIFs and
DVFs dynamically through iterative learning. Extensive experiments over
multiple domain generalizable segmentation tasks show that FSDR achieves
superior segmentation and its performance is even on par with domain adaptation

front, where both adiabatic and radiative losses are present. Here we calculate
the spectrum of cosmic ray protons released during the evolution of supernovae
of different types, accounting for the escape from upstream and for adiabatic
losses of particles advected downstream of the shock and liberated at later
times. The same calculation is carried out for electrons. The magnetic field in
the post-shock region is calculated by using an analytic treatment of the
magnetic field amplification due to non--resonant and resonant streaming
instability and their saturation. We find that when the field is the result of
the growth of the cosmic-ray--driven non--resonant instability alone, the
spectrum of electrons and protons released by a supernova remnant are indeed
different, but such a difference becomes appreciable only at energies $\gtrsim
100-1000$ GeV, while observations of the electron spectrum require such a
difference to be present at energies as low as $\sim 10$ GeV. An effect at such
low energies requires substantial magnetic field amplification in the late
stages of the supernova remnant evolution (shock velocity $\ll 1000$ km/s),
perhaps not due to streaming instability but hydrodynamical processes. We
comment on the feasibility of such conditions and speculate on the possibility
that the difference in spectral shape between electrons and protons may reflect

formulation for ductile fracture. Here, a phase-field formulation is used to
resolve failure mechanisms by regularizing the sharp crack topology on the
local state. The coupling of plasticity to the crack phase-field is realized by
a constitutive work density function, which is characterized through a degraded
stored elastic energy and the accumulated dissipated energy due to plasticity
and damage. Two different Global-Local approaches based on the idea of
multiplicative Schwarz' alternating method are proposed: (i) A global
constitutive model with an elastic-plastic behavior is first proposed, while it
is enhanced with a single local domain, which, in turn, describes an
elastic-plastic fracturing response. (ii) The main objective of the second
model is to introduce an adoption of the Global-Local approach toward the
multilevel local setting. To this end, an elastic-plastic global constitutive
model is augmented with two distinct local domains; in which, the first local
domain behaves as an elastic-plastic material and the next local domain is
modeled due to the fracture state. To further reduce the computational cost,
predictor-corrector adaptivity within Global-Local concept is introduced. An
adaptive scheme is devised through the evolution of the effective global
plastic flow (for only elastic-plastic adaptivity), and through the evolution
of the local crack phase-field state (for only fracture adaptivity). Thus, two
local domains are dynamically updated during the computation, resulting with
two-way adaptivity procedure. The overall response of the Global-Local approach
in terms of accuracy/robustness and efficiency is verified using single-scale
problems. The resulting framework is algorithmically described in detail and
substantiated with numerical examples.

Prior studies show, with a spatial-temporalinterleaving structure, neural
networks can efficiently utilize the multi-channel signals of the ad hoc array.
In this paper, we further extend this approach to continuous speech separation.
Several techniques are introduced to enable speech separation for real
continuous recordings. First, we apply a transformer-based network for
spatio-temporal modeling of the ad hoc array signals. In addition, two methods
are proposed to mitigate a speech duplication problem during single talker
segments, which seems more severe in the ad hoc array scenarios. One method is
device distortion simulation for reducing the acoustic mismatch between
simulated training data and real recordings. The other is speaker counting to
detect the single speaker segments and merge the output signal channels.
Experimental results for AdHoc-LibiCSS, a new dataset consisting of continuous
recordings of concatenated LibriSpeech utterances obtained by multiple
different devices, show the proposed separation method can significantly
improve the ASR accuracy for overlapped speech with little performance

{=\frac{df(R(r))}{dR(r)} } = 1-\frac{F_0-\left(n-3\right)}{r^n}$ with a
constant $F_0$ and show that we can generate asymptotically GR BH solutions for
$n>2$ but we show that the $n=2$ case is not allowed. This form of $F_1(r)$
could be the most acceptable physical form that we can generate from it
physical metric potentials that can have a well-known asymptotic form and we
obtain the metric of the Einstein general relativity in the limit of $F_0\to

engineering because a BC captures the particular combination of circumstances,
i.e., divergence, in which the goals of the requirement cannot be satisfied as
a whole. Existing researches have attempted to automatically identify lots of
BCs. Unfortunately, a large number of identified BCs make assessing and
resolving divergences expensive. Existing methods adopt a coarse-grained
metric, generality, to filter out less general BCs. However, the results still
retain a large number of redundant BCs since a general BC potentially captures
redundant circumstances that do not lead to a divergence. Furthermore, the
likelihood of BC can be misled by redundant BCs resulting in costly repeatedly
assessing and resolving divergences.
  In this paper, we present a fine-grained metric to filter out the redundant
BCs. We first introduce the concept of contrasty of BC. Intuitively, if two BCs
are contrastive, they capture different divergences. We argue that a set of
contrastive BCs should be recommended to engineers, rather than a set of
general BCs that potentially only indicates the same divergence. Then we design
a post-processing framework (PPAc) to produce a set of contrastive BCs after
identifying BCs. Experimental results show that the contrasty metric
dramatically reduces the number of BCs recommended to engineers. Results also
demonstrate that lots of BCs identified by the state-of-the-art method are
redundant in most cases. Besides, to improve efficiency, we propose a joint
framework (JAc) to interleave assessing based on the contrasty metric with
identifying BCs. The primary intuition behind JAc is that it considers the
search bias toward contrastive BCs during identifying BCs, thereby pruning the
BCs capturing the same divergence. Experiments confirm the improvements of JAc
in identifying contrastive BCs.

develop a method based on the filter function formalism to perturbatively

derive a composition rule for the filter function of a sequence of gates in

efficiently compute the quantum process of the whole sequence. Moreover, we
show that correlation terms arise which capture the effects of the
concatenation and thus yield insight into the effect of noise correlations on

the asymptotic structure of gravitational fields of isolated systems at null
infinity. However, the studies of the asymptotic behaviour of fields near
spatial infinity are more challenging due to the singular nature of spatial
infinity in a regular point compactification for spacetimes with non-vanishing
ADM mass. Two different frameworks that address this challenge are Friedrich's
cylinder at spatial infinity and Ashtekar's definition of asymptotically
Minkowskian spacetimes at spatial infinity that give rise to the 3-dimensional
asymptote at spatial infinity $\mathcal{H}$. Both frameworks address the
singularity at spatial infinity although the link between the two approaches
had not been investigated in the literature. This article aims to show the
relation between Friedrich's cylinder and the asymptote as spatial infinity. To
do so, we initially consider this relation for Minkowski spacetime. It can be
shown that the solution to the conformal geodesic equations provides a
conformal factor that links the cylinder and the asymptote. For general
spacetimes satisfying Ashtekar's definition, the conformal factor cannot be
determined explicitly. However, proof of the existence of this conformal factor
is provided in this article. Additionally, the conditions satisfied by physical
fields on the asymptote $\mathcal{H}$ are derived systematically using the
conformal constraint equations. Finally, it is shown that a solution to the
conformal geodesic equations on the asymptote can be extended to a small
neighbourhood of spatial infinity by making use of the stability theorem for
ordinary differential equations. This solution can be used to construct a
conformal Gaussian system in a neighbourhood of $\mathcal{H}$.

visibilities to a mean factor of 4.3 longer baseline than the Fourier transform
of the CLEAN images and a factor of 3.0 longer baseline than the transform of

for each source, identifying new substructure interior to 30 au in multiple

rings to be narrower and brighter. Across the survey, high contrast gaps are an
average 14% wider and 44% deeper in the frank profiles relative to CLEAN, and
high contrast rings are an average 26% narrower. Categorizing the frank
brightness profiles into trends, we find that the relative scarcity of features
interior to 30 au in the survey's CLEAN images is an artifact of resolving
power, rather than an intrinsic rarity of inner disc (or compact disc)

pathways is critical to unravel the magnitude of mass transport in the
protoplanetary disk, the accretionary history of the terrestrial planet region
and, by extension, its prebiotic inventory. Here, we trace the heritage of
pristine components from the relatively unaltered CV chondrite Leoville through
their mass-independent Cr and mass-dependent Zn isotope compositions.
Investigating these chondritic fractions in such detail reveals an onion-shell
structure of chondrules, which is characterized by 54Cr- and 66Zn-poor cores
surrounded by increasingly 54Cr- and 66Zn-rich igneous rims and an outer
coating of fine-grained dust. This is interpreted as a progressive addition of
54Cr- and 66Zn-rich, CI-like material to the accretion region of these
carbonaceous chondrites. Our findings show that the observed Cr isotopic range
in chondrules from more altered CV chondrites is the result of chemical
equilibration between chondrules and matrix during secondary alteration. The
54Cr-poor nature of the cores of Leoville chondrules implies formation in the
inner Solar System and subsequent massive outward chondrule transport past the
Jupiter barrier. At the same time, CI-like dust is transferred inwards. We
propose that the accreting Earth acquired CI-like dust through this mechanism
within the lifetime of the disk. This radial mixing of chondrules and matrix
shows the limited capacity of Jupiter to act as an efficient barrier and
maintain the proposed non-carbonaceous and carbonaceous chondrite dichotomy
over time. Finally, also considering current astrophysical models, we explore
both inner and outer Solar System origins for the CV chondrite parent body.

binary weights and activations to reduce the quantization error and effectively
improves the classification accuracy of BNNs. However, the scaling factors not
only increase the computational complexity of networks, but also make no sense
to the signs of binary features. To this end, Self-Distribution Binary Neural
Network (SD-BNN) is proposed. Firstly, we utilize Activation Self Distribution
(ASD) to adaptively adjust the sign distribution of activations, thereby
improve the sign differences of the outputs of the convolution. Secondly, we
adjust the sign distribution of weights through Weight Self Distribution (WSD)
and then fine-tune the sign distribution of the outputs of the convolution.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets with various network

solution to running database containers in production. In essence, the proposed
solution distinguishes the stateless data access (i.e. reading) from the
stateful data processing (i.e. creating, updating, and deleting) in databases.
A master database handles the stateful data processing and dumps database
copies for building container images, while the database containers will keep
stateless at runtime, based on the preloaded dump in the image. Although there
are delays in the state/image update propagation, this solution is particularly
suitable for the read-only, the eventual consistency, and the asynchronous
processing scenarios. Moreover, with optimal tuning (e.g., disabling locking),
the portability and performance gains of a read-only database container would
outweigh the performance loss in accessing data across the underlying image
layers.

  Dynamical Systems",,,,,"cs.AI cs.RO cs.SE cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study planning problems for dynamical systems with uncertainty caused by
measurement and process noise. Measurement noise causes limited observability
of system states, and process noise causes uncertainty in the outcome of a
given control. The problem is to find a controller that guarantees that the
system reaches a desired goal state in finite time while avoiding obstacles,
with at least some required probability. Due to the noise, this problem does
not admit exact algorithmic or closed-form solutions in general. Our key
contribution is a novel planning scheme that employs Kalman filtering as a
state estimator to obtain a finite-state abstraction of the dynamical system,
which we formalize as a Markov decision process (MDP). By extending this MDP
with intervals of probabilities, we enhance the robustness of the model against
numerical imprecision in approximating the transition probabilities. For this
so-called interval MDP (iMDP), we employ state-of-the-art verification
techniques to efficiently compute plans that maximize the probability of
reaching goal states. We show the correctness of the abstraction and provide
several optimizations that aim to balance the quality of the plan and the
scalability of the approach. We demonstrate that our method is able to handle
systems with a 6-dimensional state that result in iMDPs with tens of thousands
of states and millions of transitions.

severe societal concerns. Recently, how to detect such forgery contents has
become a hot research topic and many deepfake detection methods have been
proposed. Most of them model deepfake detection as a vanilla binary
classification problem, i.e, first use a backbone network to extract a global
feature and then feed it into a binary classifier (real/fake). But since the
difference between the real and fake images in this task is often subtle and
local, we argue this vanilla solution is not optimal. In this paper, we instead
formulate deepfake detection as a fine-grained classification problem and
propose a new multi-attentional deepfake detection network. Specifically, it
consists of three key components: 1) multiple spatial attention heads to make
the network attend to different local parts; 2) textural feature enhancement
block to zoom in the subtle artifacts in shallow features; 3) aggregate the
low-level textural feature and high-level semantic features guided by the
attention maps. Moreover, to address the learning difficulty of this network,
we further introduce a new regional independence loss and an attention guided
data augmentation strategy. Through extensive experiments on different
datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over the vanilla binary
classifier counterparts, and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Such models are prevalent in many disciplines including genetics, biology,

evaluation by finding parameter values of the model that generate data close to
the observed data. The general consensus has been that it is most efficient to
compare datasets on the basis of a low dimensional informative summary
statistic, incurring information loss in favour of reduced dimensionality. More
recently, researchers have explored various approaches for efficiently
comparing empirical distributions in the likelihood-free context in an effort
to avoid data summarisation. This article provides a review of these full data
distance based approaches, and conducts the first comprehensive comparison of
such methods, both qualitatively and empirically. We also conduct a substantive
empirical comparison with summary statistic based likelihood-free methods. The
discussion and results offer guidance to practitioners considering a
likelihood-free approach. Whilst we find the best approach to be problem

promising and warrant further development. We discuss some opportunities for

ultracold atoms. We demonstrate that this conductivity contains rich
information on quantum states by analyzing experimentally achievable systems
such as a spin-1/2 superfluid Fermi gas, a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate, and
a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The obtained conductivity spectra being absent in
the Drude conductivity reflect quasiparticle excitations and non-Fermi liquid
properties. Accessible physical quantities include the superfluid gap and the
contact for the superfluid Fermi gas, gapped and gapless spin excitations as
well as quantum depletion for the Bose-Einstein condensate, and the spin part
of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid parameter elusive in cold-atom experiments.
Unlike its mass transport counterpart, the spin conductivity serves as a probe
applicable to clean atomic gases without disorder and lattice potentials. Our
formalism can be generalized to various systems such as spin-orbit coupled and
nonequilibrium systems.

different views) commonly used for audio and music recognition tasks, the
proposed multi-view network consists of four subnetworks, each handling one
input types. The learned embedding in the subnetworks are then concatenated to
form the multi-view embedding for classification similar to a simple
concatenation network. However, apart from the joint classification branch, the
network also maintains four classification branches on the single-view
embedding of the subnetworks. A novel method is then proposed to keep track of
the learning behavior on the classification branches and adapt their weights to
proportionally blend their gradients for network training. The weights are
adapted in such a way that learning on a branch that is generalizing well will
be encouraged whereas learning on a branch that is overfitting will be slowed
down. Experiments on three different audio and music classification tasks show
that the proposed multi-view network not only outperforms the single-view
baselines but also is superior to the multi-view baselines based on
concatenation and late fusion.

from acoustic hearing by normal-hearing (NH) listeners, presumably showing
unequal speech quality perception in various noise environments. Noise
reduction (NR) algorithms used in CI reduce the noise in favor of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), regardless of plausible accompanying distortions
that may degrade the speech quality perception. To gain better understanding of
CI speech quality perception, the present work aimed investigating speech
quality perception in a diverse noise conditions, including factors of
speech/noise levels, type of noise, and distortions caused by NR models.
Fifteen NH and seven CI subjects participated in this study. Speech sentences
were set to two different levels (65 and 75 dB SPL). Two types of noise
(Cafeteria and Babble) at three levels (55, 65, and 75 dB SPL) were used.
Sentences were processed using two NR algorithms to investigate the perceptual
sensitivity of CI and NH listeners to the distortion. All sentences processed
with the combinations of these sets were presented to CI and NH listeners, and
they were asked to rate the sound quality of speech as they perceived. The
effect of each factor on the perceived speech quality was investigated based on
the group averaged quality rated by CI and NH listeners. Consistent with
previous studies, CI listeners were not as sensitive as NH to the distortion
made by NR algorithms. Statistical analysis showed that the speech level has
significant effect on quality perception. At the same SNR, the quality of 65 dB
speech was rated higher than that of 75 dB for CI users, but vice versa for NH
listeners. Therefore, the present study showed that the perceived speech
quality patterns were different between CI and NH listeners in terms of their
sensitivity to distortion and speech level in complex listening environment.

unveiled that an inner disk radius remained at the same location around 2-9

gravitational $N$-body systems with linear time scaling on $N$, based on the
Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) approach. This allows us to simulate globular
clusters with a realistic number of stellar particles in a matter of hours on a
typical workstation. We evolve star clusters containing up to $10^6$ stars to
core collapse and beyond. We quantify several aspects of core collapse over
multiple realizations and different parameters, while always resolving the
cluster core with a realistic number of particles. We run a large set of N-body
simulations with our new code. The cluster mass function is a power-law with no
stellar evolution, allowing us to clearly measure the effects of the mass
spectrum. Leading up to core collapse, we find a power-law relation between the
size of the core and the time left to core collapse. Our simulations thus
confirm the theoretical self-similar contraction picture but with a dependence
on the slope of the mass function. The time of core collapse has a
non-monotonic dependence on the slope, which is well fit by a parabola. This
holds also for the depth of core collapse and for the dynamical friction
timescale of heavy particles. Cluster density profiles at core collapse show a
broken power law structure, suggesting that central cusps are a genuine feature
of collapsed cores. The core bounces back after collapse, and the inner density
slope evolves to an asymptotic value. The presence of an intermediate-mass
black hole inhibits core collapse. We confirm and expand on several predictions
of star cluster evolution before, during, and after core collapse. Such
predictions were based on theoretical calculations or small-size direct
$N$-body simulations. Here we put them to the test on MPC simulations with a
much larger number of particles, allowing us to resolve the collapsing core.

extends those results to all pure two-qubit states, where each qubit can be

surface, from initially closed pockets to the surface with open Fermi sheets,
creating two peculiar points in the band dispersion - the saddle point and
elliptical point, between which the pseudogap in electron density of states
develops. The self-consistent periodic potential appears as a result of
interactions, either electron-phonon, or electron electron, which, linked with
the topological instability of the system, results in formation of a new ground

constant is larger than critical. Our analysis shows that the phase transition

gravity-darkening exponents for white dwarfs in the literature. On the other
hand, the number of known eclipsing binaries whose components are tidally
and/or rotationally distorted white dwarfs is increasing year on year.
  Our main objective is to present the first theoretical approaches to the
problem of the distribution of temperatures on the surfaces of compact stars
distorted by rotation and/or tides in order to compare with relevant
observational data.
  We find discrepancies between the gravity-darkening exponents calculated with
our methods and the predictions of the von Zeipel theorem, particularly in the
cases of cold white dwarfs; although the discrepancy also applies to higher
effective temperatures under determined physical conditions. We find physical
connections between the gravity-darkening exponents calculated using our
modified method of triangles strategy with the convective efficiency (defined
here as the ratio of the convective to the total flux). A connection between
the entropy and the gravity-darkening coefficients is also found: variations of
the former cause changes in the way the temperature is distributed on distorted
stellar surfaces.
  On the other hand, we have generalised the von Zeipel theorem for the case of
hot white dwarfs. Such a generalisation allows us to predict that, under
certain circumstances, the value of the gravity-darkening exponent may be
smaller than 1.0, even in the case of high effective temperatures.

was so far restricted to one body processes. Leveraging cavity QED for the
quantum simulation of complex, many-body systems has thus far relied on
multi-photon processes, scaling down the light-matter interaction to the low
energy and slow time scales of the many-body problem. Here we report on cavity
QED experiments using molecular transitions in a strongly interacting Fermi

strong light-matter and strong inter-particle interactions leads to well
resolved pair-polaritons, hybrid excitations coherently mixing photons, atom
pairs and molecules. The dependence of the pair-polariton spectrum on
interatomic interactions is universal, independent of the transition used,
demonstrating a direct mapping between pair correlations in the ground state
and the optical spectrum. This represents a magnification of many-body effects
by two orders of magnitude in energy. In the dispersive regime, it enables
fast, minimally destructive measurements of pair correlations, and opens the
way towards their measurements at the quantum limit and their coherent

originally motivated by questions in the foundations of quantum mechanics has
more recently been tied to questions in quantum cryptography, complexity
theory, operator space theory, group theory, and more. Synchronous correlation
sets introduced in [Paulsen et. al, JFA 2016] are a subclass of correlations
that has proven particularly useful to study and arises naturally in
applications. We show that any correlation that is almost synchronous, in a
natural $\ell_1$ sense, arises from a state and measurement operators that are
well-approximated by a convex combination of projective measurements on a
maximally entangled state. This extends a result of [Paulsen et. al, JFA 2016]
which applies to exactly synchronous correlations. Crucially, the quality of
approximation is independent of the dimension of the Hilbert spaces or of the
size of the correlation. Our result allows one to reduce the analysis of many
classes of nonlocal games, including rigidity properties, to the case of
strategies using maximally entangled states which are generally easier to
manipulate.

in autonomous swarms of drones. Here, the two main problems are: 1) how to
avoid collisions by temporarily breaking the formation, i.e., collision
avoidance reformation, and 2) how do such reformation while minimizing the
deviation resulting in minimization of the overall time and energy consumption
of the drones. To address the first question, we use cellular automata based
technique to find an efficient formation that avoids the obstacle while
minimizing the time and energy. Concerning the second question, a near-optimal
reformation of the swarm after successful collision avoidance is achieved by
applying a temperature function reduction technique, originally used in the
point set registration process. The goal of the reformation process is to
remove the disturbance while minimizing the overall time it takes for the swarm
to reach the destination and consequently reducing the energy consumption
required by this operation. To measure the degree of formation disturbance due
to collision avoidance, deviation of the centroid of the swarm formation is
used, inspired by the concept of the center of mass in classical mechanics.
Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed technique, in terms of
performance and energy.

in-depth analysis of performance across several dimensions: individuals(40
subjects), genders (male and female), skin types (darker and lighter), and
databases (BP4D and DISFA). To help suppress the variance in data, we use the
notion of self-supervised denoising autoencoders to design a method for deep
face normalization(DeepFN) that transfers facial expressions of different
people onto a common facial template which is then used to train and evaluate
facial action recognition models. We show that person-independent models yield
significantly lower performance (55% average F1 and accuracy across 40
subjects) than person-dependent models (60.3%), leading to a generalization gap
of 5.3%. However, normalizing the data with the newly introduced DeepFN
significantly increased the performance of person-independent models (59.6%),
effectively reducing the gap. Similarly, we observed generalization gaps when
considering gender (2.4%), skin type (5.3%), and dataset (9.4%), which were
significantly reduced with the use of DeepFN. These findings represent an

far above the electroweak scale. Due to the presence of a mass hierarchy,
effective field theory (EFT) is a suitable tool for the study of such
extensions. In this thesis, we provide a solution to the matching problem at
the one-loop level in the form of the Bispinor Universal One-Loop Effective
Action (BSUOLEA), which is a pre-computed expression for the effective action,
parameterised in terms of derivatives of the Lagrangian of the ultraviolet (UV)
model. The BSUOLEA is derived using functional methods and is sufficiently
general to match any renormalisable, Lorentz invariant UV model to an EFT,
containing operators of mass dimension up to and including six at the one-loop
level. This includes supersymmetric models regularised in dimensional
reduction. Since the pre-computed expression contains many operators, it is
implemented into a currently private Mathematica package, which automatically
performs the matching based on the BSUOLEA. We illustrate the use of this
package, which will be made publicly available in the near future, by applying
it to the matching of the Singlet Extended SM to the SM EFT. We then expand the
framework in order to apply it to a non-renormalisable extension of the SM
containing a vector resonance, which is assumed to arise from the confinement
of a gauge group at high energies. This model raises some interesting
theoretical questions since such a vector resonance comprises a system with
second-class constraints. We perform the constraint analysis of the model and
derive the generating functional in order to apply functional methods to the
matching. We finally match the model to the SM EFT and present the full

performance of computer vision applications. Thus, it is of vital importance to
remove rain streaks and facilitate our vision systems. While recent
convolutinal neural network based methods have shown promising results in
single image rain removal (SIRR), they fail to effectively capture long-range
location dependencies or aggregate convolutional channel information
simultaneously. However, as SIRR is a highly illposed problem, these spatial
and channel information are very important clues to solve SIRR. First, spatial
information could help our model to understand the image context by gathering
long-range dependency location information hidden in the image. Second,
aggregating channels could help our model to concentrate on channels more
related to image background instead of rain streaks. In this paper, we propose
a non-local channel aggregation network (NCANet) to address the SIRR problem.
NCANet models 2D rainy images as sequences of vectors in three directions,
namely vertical direction, transverse direction and channel direction.
Recurrently aggregating information from all three directions enables our model
to capture the long-range dependencies in both channels and spaitials
locations. Extensive experiments on both heavy and light rain image data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NCANet model.

recursive arithmetic) by adapting a recent technique from Kripke (forthcoming).
Since PRA is consistent, however, this is regarded as a paradox to be resolved.
The argument is inspired by the v-Curry paradox, but it utilizes only a
syntactic notion of proof, not a semantic notion such as validity. Put
informally, one can construct a sentence which effectively ""says"" in the
language of arithmetic ""Haskell codes a disproof of this very sentence,"" where
a constant like 'Haskell' is interpreted (per Kripke's technique) as denoting
the code of such a disproof. It can then be argued that such a sentence is both
true and false. Some suggestions for a resolving the paradox are considered,
but none are found to be promising. The solution of the paradox thus remains an
open question.

and asthma, are a serious health crisis, affecting a large number of people
globally and inflicting major costs on the economy. Current methods for
assessing the progression of respiratory symptoms are either subjective and
inaccurate, or complex and cumbersome, and do not incorporate environmental

exacerbations can lead to hospitalizations and high medical costs. This work
presents a multi-modal solution for predicting the exacerbation risks of
respiratory diseases, such as COPD, based on a novel spatio-temporal machine

and tracking of local environmental and meteorological data and trends. The
proposed new machine learning architecture blends key attributes of both
convolutional and recurrent neural networks, allowing extraction of both
spatial and temporal features encoded in respiratory sounds, thereby leading to
accurate classification and tracking of symptoms. Combined with the data from
environmental and meteorological sensors, and a predictive model based on
retrospective medical studies, this solution can assess and provide early
warnings of respiratory disease exacerbations. This research will improve the
quality of patients' lives through early medical intervention, thereby reducing

been proved to converge before beginning to prove the convergence of the

  Initially, the the nature of problem was explored and explained the reason

success in dealing with graph-structured data. Nevertheless, it is well known
that deep GCNs suffer from the over-smoothing problem, where node
representations tend to be indistinguishable as more layers are stacked up. The
theoretical research to date on deep GCNs has focused primarily on expressive
power rather than trainability, an optimization perspective. Compared to
expressivity, trainability attempts to address a more fundamental question:
Given a sufficiently expressive space of models, can we successfully find a
good solution via gradient descent-based optimizers? This work fills this gap
by exploiting the Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK), which governs the
optimization trajectory under gradient descent for wide GCNs. We formulate the
asymptotic behaviors of GNTK in the large depth, which enables us to reveal the
dropping trainability of wide and deep GCNs at an exponential rate in the
optimization process. Additionally, we extend our theoretical framework to
analyze residual connection-based techniques, which are found to be merely able
to mitigate the exponential decay of trainability mildly. Inspired by our
theoretical insights on trainability, we propose Critical DropEdge, a
connectivity-aware and graph-adaptive sampling method, to alleviate the
exponential decay problem more fundamentally. Experimental evaluation
consistently confirms using our proposed method can achieve better results
compared to relevant counterparts with both infinite-width and finite-width.

statistical method that allows giving a clustering of individuals, but also
revealing relevant omic variables from the various blocks. Here, we present
PIntMF (Penalized Integrative Matrix Factorization), a model of MF with
sparsity, positivity and equality constraints.To induce sparsity in the model,
we use a classical Lasso penalization on variable and individual matrices. For
the matrix of samples, sparsity helps for the clustering, and normalization
(matching an equality constraint) of inferred coefficients is added for a
better interpretation. Besides, we add an automatic tuning of the sparsity
parameters using the famous glmnet package. We also proposed three criteria to

other state-of-the-art integrative methods including feature selection
techniques in both synthetic and real data. PIntMF succeeds in finding relevant

built-in privacy protections, they do not satisfy formal privacy protections

Given the importance of making high-quality public health data publicly
available while preserving the privacy of the underlying data subjects, we aim
to improve the utility of a recently developed approach for generating
Poisson-distributed, differentially private synthetic data by using publicly
available information to truncate the range of the synthetic data.
Specifically, we utilize county-level population information from the U.S.
Census Bureau and national death reports produced by the CDC to inform prior
distributions on county-level death rates and infer reasonable ranges for
Poisson-distributed, county-level death counts. In doing so, the requirements
for satisfying differential privacy for a given privacy budget can be reduced
by several orders of magnitude, thereby leading to substantial improvements in
utility. To illustrate our proposed approach, we consider a dataset comprised
of over 26,000 cancer-related deaths from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
belonging to over 47,000 combinations of cause-of-death and demographic
variables such as age, race, sex, and county-of-residence and demonstrate the

for a correlation between the momentum and spin of the charge, thus leading to
spin polarized current. This phenomenon is known as the chiral induced spin
selectivity (CISS) effect. One of the most surprising experimental results
recently demonstrated is that magnetization reversal in a ferromagnet (FM) with
perpendicular anisotropy can be realized solely by chemisorbing a chiral
molecular monolayer without applying any current or external magnetic field.
This result raises the currently open question of whether this effect is due to
the bonding event, held by the ferromagnet, or a long timescale effect
stabilized by exchange interactions. In this work we have performed vectorial
magnetic field measurements of the magnetization reorientation of a
ferromagnetic layer exhibiting perpendicular anisotropy due to CISS using
nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and followed the time dynamics of this
effect. In parallel, we have measured the molecular monolayer tilt angle in
order to find a correlation between the time dependence of the magnetization
re-orientation and the change of the tilt angle of the molecular monolayer. We
have identified that changes in the magnetization direction correspond to
changes of the molecular monolayer tilt angle, providing evidence for a
long-timescale characteristic of the induced magnetization reorientation. This
suggests that the CISS effect has an effect over long-timescales which we
attribute to exchange interactions. These results offer significant insights
into the fundamental processes underlying the CISS effect, contributing to the
implementation of CISS in state-of-the-art applications such as spintronic and
magnetic memory devices.

areas in the society. As AI solutions have become more sophistication and the
use cases grew, they highlighted the need to address performance and energy
efficiency challenges faced during the implementation process. To address these
challenges, there has been growing interest in neuromorphic chips. Neuromorphic
computing relies on non von Neumann architectures as well as novel devices,
circuits and manufacturing technologies to mimic the human brain. Among such
technologies, 3D integration is an important enabler for AI hardware and the
continuation of the scaling laws. In this paper, we overview the unique
opportunities 3D integration provides in neuromorphic chip design, discuss the
emerging opportunities in next generation neuromorphic architectures and review
the obstacles. Neuromorphic architectures, which relied on the brain for
inspiration and emulation purposes, face grand challenges due to the limited
understanding of the functionality and the architecture of the human brain.
Yet, high-levels of investments are dedicated to develop neuromorphic chips. We
argue that 3D integration not only provides strategic advantages to the
cost-effective and flexible design of neuromorphic chips, it may provide design
flexibility in incorporating advanced capabilities to further benefits the
designs in the future.

survey the literature on the use of Deep Neural Networks for automated and
objective surgical skill assessment, with a focus on kinematic data as putative
markers of surgical competency. There is considerable recent interest in deep

computational hardware to train and host them. We have reviewed 530 papers, of
which we selected 25 for this systematic review. Based on this review, we

large, publicly available, annotated datasets that are representative of the
surgical trainee and expert demographics and multimodal data beyond kinematics

to train deep classification models, transfer learning is a promising approach
by transferring knowledge from the abundant typical pneumonia datasets for
COVID-19 image classification. However, negative transfer may deteriorate the
performance due to the feature distribution divergence between two datasets and
task semantic difference in diagnosing pneumonia and COVID-19 that rely on
different characteristics. It is even more challenging when the target dataset
has no labels available, i.e., unsupervised task transfer learning. In this
paper, we propose a novel Task Adaptation Network (TAN) to solve this
unsupervised task transfer problem. In addition to learning transferable
features via domain-adversarial training, we propose a novel task semantic
adaptor that uses the learning-to-learn strategy to adapt the task semantics.
Experiments on three public COVID-19 datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method achieves superior performance. Especially on COVID-DA dataset, TAN
significantly increases the recall and F1 score by 5.0% and 7.8% compared to
recently strong baselines. Moreover, we show that TAN also achieves superior
performance on several public domain adaptation benchmarks.

annotation is done through a time-consuming process by EEG specialists.
Computer-assisted systems for seizure detection currently lack extensive
clinical utility due to retrospective, patient-specific, and/or irreproducible
studies that result in low sensitivity or high false positives in clinical
tests. We aim to significantly reduce the time and resources on data annotation
by demonstrating a continental generalization of seizure detection that
balances sensitivity and specificity. This is a prospective inference test of
artificial intelligence on nearly 14,590 hours of adult EEG data from patients
with epilepsy between 2011 and 2019 in a hospital in Sydney, Australia. The
inference set includes patients with different types and frequencies of
seizures across a wide range of ages and EEG recording hours. We validated our
inference model in an AI-assisted mode with a human expert arbiter and a result

conducted independently over nine years. Our pilot test of 66 sessions with a

radio frequency (RF) data apply off-the-shelf deep neural network (DNN) models,
which were matured mainly for domains like vision and language. However,
wireless RF data possesses unique characteristics that differentiate it from
these other domains. For instance, RF data encompasses intermingled time and
frequency features that are dictated by the underlying hardware and protocol
configurations. In addition, wireless RF communication signals exhibit
cyclostationarity due to repeated patterns (PHY pilots, frame prefixes, etc.)
that these signals inherently contain. In this paper, we begin by explaining
and showing the unsuitability as well as limitations of existing DNN feature
design approaches currently proposed to be used for wireless device
classification. We then present novel feature design approaches that exploit
the distinct structures of the RF communication signals and the spectrum
emissions caused by transmitter hardware impairments to custom-make DNN models
suitable for classifying wireless devices using RF signal data. Our proposed
DNN feature designs substantially improve classification robustness in terms of
scalability, accuracy, signature anti-cloning, and insensitivity to environment
perturbations. We end the paper by presenting other feature design strategies
that have great potentials for providing further performance improvements of
the DNN-based wireless device classification, and discuss the open research
challenges related to these proposed strategies.
