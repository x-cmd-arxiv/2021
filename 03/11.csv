light diquark $u^{T}C\gamma_5d$ and heavy antidiquark $\overline{c}

into account various vacuum condensates up to dimension $10$. The width of the
resonance $X_1(2900)$ is saturated by two decay channels $X_1 \to D^{-}K^{+}$

technical tools of the soft-meson approximation. Results for the mass of the

$\Gamma _{\mathrm{full}}=(93\pm 13)~\mathrm{MeV}$ are smaller than their
experimental values reported by the LHCb collaboration. Nevertheless, by taking
into account theoretical and experimental errors of investigations,
interpretation of the state $X_1(2900)$ as the vector tetraquark does not
contradict to the LHCb data. We also point out that analysis of the invariant

dynamical system state variables and parameters, and is cast as a likelihood
function. We elicit prior distributions of the effective population size, the
dynamical system initial conditions and infectious contact rate, and use Markov
Chain Monte Carlo sampling to make inference and prediction of quantities of
interest (QoI) at the onset of the epidemic outbreak. The forecast is
sequentially updated over a sliding window of epidemic records as new data
becomes available. Prior distributions for the state variables at the new
forecasting time are assembled using the dynamical system, calibrated for the
previous forecast. Moreover, changes in the contact rate and effective

physical object's surface -- is typically large in size, which entails
expensive subsequent operations like viewpoint image rendering and object
recognition. Leveraging on recent advances in graph sampling, we propose a fast
PC sub-sampling algorithm that reduces its size while preserving the overall
object shape. Specifically, to articulate a sampling objective, we first assume
a super-resolution (SR) method based on feature graph Laplacian regularization
(FGLR) that reconstructs the original high-resolution PC, given 3D points
chosen by a sampling matrix $\H$. We prove that minimizing a worst-case SR
reconstruction error is equivalent to maximizing the smallest eigenvalue
$\lambda_{\min}$ of a matrix $\H^{\top} \H + \mu \cL$, where $\cL$ is a
symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix computed from the neighborhood graph
connecting the 3D points. Instead, for fast computation we maximize a lower
bound $\lambda^-_{\min}(\H^{\top} \H + \mu \cL)$ via selection of $\H$ in three
steps. Interpreting $\cL$ as a generalized graph Laplacian matrix corresponding
to an unbalanced signed graph $\cG$, we first approximate $\cG$ with a balanced
graph $\cG_B$ with the corresponding generalized graph Laplacian matrix
$\cL_B$. Second, leveraging on a recent theorem called Gershgorin disc perfect
alignment (GDPA), we perform a similarity transform $\cL_p = \S \cL_B \S^{-1}$
so that Gershgorin disc left-ends of $\cL_p$ are all aligned at the same value
$\lambda_{\min}(\cL_B)$. Finally, we perform PC sub-sampling on $\cG_B$ using a
graph sampling algorithm to maximize $\lambda^-_{\min}(\H^{\top} \H + \mu
\cL_p)$ in roughly linear time. Experimental results show that 3D points chosen
by our algorithm outperformed competing schemes both numerically and visually
in SR reconstruction quality.

  We can view natural models from several different viewpoints, of which we
focus on three in this thesis. First, natural models are essentially algebraic,
meaning that they can be described by specifying operations between sorts,
subject to equational axioms; this allows us to assemble natural models into a
category with certain beneficial properties. Second, since natural models are
natural transformations between presheaves, they are morphisms in a locally
cartesian closed category, meaning that they can be regarded as polynomials.
Third, since natural models admit interpretations of dependent type theory, we
can use them to provide a functorial semantics.

level of dysarthria by analyzing the intelligibility of speech spoken by an

intelligibility assessment systems which requires patients to speak a large

procedure to select an optimal (small) number of utterances that need to be

(TOF-MRA) has undergone drastic improvements with the advent of Deep Learning
(DL). However, performances of supervised DL models heavily rely on the
quantity of labeled samples, which are extremely costly to obtain. Here, we
present a DL model for aneurysm detection that overcomes the issue with
''weak'' labels: oversized annotations which are considerably faster to create.
Our weak labels resulted to be four times faster to generate than their
voxel-wise counterparts. In addition, our model leverages prior anatomical
knowledge by focusing only on plausible locations for aneurysm occurrence. We
frst train and evaluate our model through cross-validation on an in-house
TOF-MRA dataset comprising 284 subjects (170 females / 127 healthy controls /
157 patients with 198 aneurysms). On this dataset, our best model achieved a
sensitivity of 83%, with False Positive (FP) rate of 0.8 per patient. To assess
model generalizability, we then participated in a challenge for aneurysm
detection with TOF-MRA data (93 patients, 20 controls, 125 aneurysms). On the
public challenge, sensitivity was 68% (FP rate=2.5), ranking 4th/18 on the open
leaderboard. We found no signifcant diference in sensitivity between aneurysm
risk-of-rupture groups (p=0.75), locations (p=0.72), or sizes (p=0.15). Data,
code and model weights are released under permissive licenses. We demonstrate
that weak labels and anatomical knowledge can alleviate the necessity for
prohibitively expensive voxel-wise annotations.

suffer from a high number and large size of messages exchanged in the Key
Management Protocol (KMP). To overcome this, an MP-NIKE scheme can eliminate
the airtime and latency of messages transferred between IoT devices. MP-NIKE
schemes can be realized by using multilinear maps. There are several attempts
for constructing multilinear maps based on indistinguishable obfuscation,
lattices and the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Nevertheless, these schemes
are inefficient in terms of computation cost and memory overhead. Besides,
several attacks have been recently reported against CRT-based and lattice-based
multilinear maps. There is only one modular exponentiation-based MP-NIKE scheme
in the literature which has been claimed to be both secure and efficient. In
this article, we present an attack on this scheme based on the Euclidean

Inspired by the latest theoretical work, we first utilize an adversarial
regressor to maximize the disparity on the target domain and train a feature
generator to minimize this disparity. However, due to the high dimension of the
output space, this regressor fails to detect samples that deviate from the
support of the source. To overcome this problem, we propose two important
ideas. First, based on our observation that the probability density of the
output space is sparse, we introduce a spatial probability distribution to
describe this sparsity and then use it to guide the learning of the adversarial
regressor. Second, to alleviate the optimization difficulty in the
high-dimensional space, we innovatively convert the minimax game in the
adversarial training to the minimization of two opposite goals. Extensive
experiments show that our method brings large improvement by 8% to 11% in terms

especially for their application in safety- and security-critical areas. Often,
the bias of a classifier is a direct consequence of a bias in the training
dataset, frequently caused by the co-occurrence of relevant features and
irrelevant ones. To mitigate this issue, we require learning algorithms that
prevent the propagation of bias from the dataset into the classifier. We
present a novel adversarial debiasing method, which addresses a feature that is
spuriously connected to the labels of training images but statistically
independent of the labels for test images. Thus, the automatic identification
of relevant features during training is perturbed by irrelevant features. This
is the case in a wide range of bias-related problems for many computer vision
tasks, such as automatic skin cancer detection or driver assistance. We argue
by a mathematical proof that our approach is superior to existing techniques
for the abovementioned bias. Our experiments show that our approach performs
better than state-of-the-art techniques on a well-known benchmark dataset with

promising ab initio method for the electronic structure of three-dimensional
metals, for which second-order perturbation theory (MP2) diverges in the
thermodynamic limit. However, due to the high cost and poor convergence of CCSD
with respect to basis size, applying CCSD to periodic systems often leads to
large basis set errors. In a common ""composite"" method, MP2 is used to recover
the missing dynamical correlation energy through a focal-point correction, but
the inadequacy of MP2 for metals raises questions about this approach. Here we
describe how high-energy excitations treated by MP2 can be ""downfolded"" into a
low-energy active space to be treated by CCSD. Comparing how the composite and
downfolding approaches perform for the uniform electron gas, we find that the
latter converges more quickly with respect to the basis set size. Nonetheless,
the composite approach is surprisingly accurate because it removes the
problematic MP2 treatment of double excitations near the Fermi surface. Using
the method to estimate the CCSD correlation energy in the combined complete
basis set and thermodynamic limits, we find CCSD recovers over 90% of the exact
correlation energy at $r_s=4$. We also test the composite and downfolding
approaches with the random-phase approximation used in place of MP2, yielding a
method that is more effective but more expensive.

more than fifty countries worldwide. However, over the past years, the quantity
of polymer counterfeits has been increasing, so has the quality of
counterfeits. This shows that the initial advantage of bringing a new polymer
technology to fight against counterfeiting is reducing. To maintain one step
ahead of counterfeiters, we propose a novel anti-counterfeiting technique
called Polymer Substrate Fingerprinting (PSF). Our technique is built based on
the observation that the opacity coating, a critical step during the production
of polymer notes, is a stochastic manufacturing process, leaving uneven
thickness in the coating layer and the random dispersion of impurities from the
ink. The imperfections in the coating layer result in random translucent
patterns when a polymer banknote is back-lit by a light source. We show these
patterns can be reliably captured by a commodity negative-film scanner and
processed into a compact fingerprint to uniquely identify each banknote. Using
an extensive dataset of 6,200 sample images collected from 340 UK banknotes, we
show that our method can reliably authenticate banknotes, and is robust against
rough daily handling of banknotes. Furthermore, we show the extracted
fingerprints contain around 900 bits of entropy, which makes it extremely
scalable to identify every polymer note circulated globally. As compared with
previous or existing anti-counterfeiting mechanisms for banknotes, our method
has a distinctive advantage: it ensures that even in the extreme case when
counterfeiters have procured the same printing equipment and ink as used by a
legitimate government, counterfeiting banknotes remains infeasible because of
the difficulty to replicate a stochastic manufacturing process.

consists of two stages. In the first stage, we construct a low-fidelity
approximation to the solution manifold over a fine training set. Then, for the
available low-fidelity snapshots of the output variable, we apply the pivoted
QR decomposition or the discrete empirical interpolation method to identify a
set of sparse sampling locations in the parameter domain. These points reveal
the structure of the parametric dependence of the output variable. The second
stage proceeds with a subsampled training set containing a by far smaller
number of parameters than the initial training set. Different subsampling
strategies inspired from recent variants of the empirical interpolation method

entrainment at the convective-radiative boundary which follows the entrainment
law, varying with boundary penetrability. We implement the entrainment law in
the 1D Geneva stellar evolution code. We then calculate models between 1.5 and
60 M$_{\odot}$ at solar metallicity ($Z=0.014$) and compare them to previous
generations of models and observations on the main sequence. The boundary
penetrability, quantified by the bulk Richardson number, $Ri_{\mathrm{B}}$,
varies with mass and to a smaller extent with time. The variation of
$Ri_{\mathrm{B}}$ with mass is due to the mass dependence of typical convective
velocities in the core and hence the luminosity of the star. The chemical
gradient above the convective core dominates the variation of $Ri_{\mathrm{B}}$
with time. An entrainment law method can therefore explain the apparent mass
dependence of convective boundary mixing through $Ri_{\mathrm{B}}$. New models
including entrainment can better reproduce the mass dependence of the main
sequence width using entrainment law parameters $A \sim 2 \times 10^{-4}$ and
$n=1$. We compare these empirically constrained values to the results of 3D

processing (NLP). However, in recent years, it has become apparent that there
are shortcomings in systematicity that limit the performance and data
efficiency of deep learning in NLP. These shortcomings can be clearly shown in
lower-level artificial tasks, mostly on synthetic data. Abstract patterns are
the best known examples of a hard problem for neural networks in terms of
generalisation to unseen data. They are defined by relations between items,
such as equality, rather than their values. It has been argued that these
low-level problems demonstrate the inability of neural networks to learn
systematically. In this study, we propose Embedded Relation Based Patterns
(ERBP) as a novel way to create a relational inductive bias that encourages
learning equality and distance-based relations for abstract patterns. ERBP is
based on Relation Based Patterns (RBP), but modelled as a Bayesian prior on
network weights and implemented as a regularisation term in otherwise standard
network learning. ERBP is is easy to integrate into standard neural networks
and does not affect their learning capacity. In our experiments, ERBP priors
lead to almost perfect generalisation when learning abstract patterns from
synthetic noise-free sequences. ERBP also improves natural language models on
the word and character level and pitch prediction in melodies with RNN, GRU and
LSTM networks. We also find improvements in in the more complex tasks of
learning of graph edit distance and compositional sentence entailment. ERBP
consistently improves over RBP and over standard networks, showing that it
enables abstract pattern learning which contributes to performance in natural

flow, a cylinder in the oscillatory flow is less studied, let alone multiple
cylinders. Therefore, we experimentally and numerically studied two identical
circular cylinders oscillating in the still water with either a side-by-side or
a tandem configuration for a wide range of Keulegan-Carpenter number and Stokes
number $\beta$. The experiment result shows that the hydrodynamic performance
of an oscillating cylinder pair in the still water is greatly altered due to
the interference between the multiple structures with different configurations.
In specific, compared to the single-cylinder case, the drag coefficient is
greatly enhanced when two cylinders are placed side-by-side at a small gap
ratio, while dual cylinders in a tandem configuration obtain a smaller drag
coefficient and oscillating lift coefficient. In order to reveal the detailed
flow physics that result in significant fluid forces alternations, the detailed
flow visualization is provided by the numerical simulation: the small gap
between two cylinders in a side-by-side configuration will result in a strong
gap jet that enhances the energy dissipation and increase the drag, while due
to the flow blocking effect for two cylinders in a tandem configuration, the
drag coefficient decreases.

Works by Adler and Adler (Eur. J. Comb.; 2014) and Fabia\'nski et al. (STACS;
2019) prove that in the powers of sparse graphs, one cannot find arbitrarily
large objects of this kind. However, these proofs either are non-constructive,

excluding a fixed clique as a minor.
  The most significant part of our work is the upper bound for planar graphs.
Here, we employ techniques of structural graph theory to analyze semi-ladders

better generalization for deep neural networks (DNNs) has been explored for
decades, spawning many different flatness measures. Recently, this link with
generalization has been called into question by a demonstration that many
measures of flatness are vulnerable to parameter re-scaling which arbitrarily
changes their value without changing neural network outputs.
  Here we show that, in addition, some popular variants of SGD such as Adam and
Entropy-SGD, can also break the flatness-generalization correlation. As an
alternative to flatness measures, we use a function based picture and propose
using the log of Bayesian prior upon initialization, $\log P(f)$, as a
predictor of the generalization when a DNN converges on function $f$ after
training to zero error. The prior is directly proportional to the Bayesian
posterior for functions that give zero error on a test set. For the case of
image classification, we show that $\log P(f)$ is a significantly more robust
predictor of generalization than flatness measures are.
  Whilst local flatness measures fail under parameter re-scaling, the
prior/posterior, which is global quantity, remains invariant under re-scaling.
Moreover, the correlation with generalization as a function of data complexity
remains good for different variants of SGD.

introducing new domain knowledge.
  Specifically, we construct a multi-modal knowledge graph out of the chest
X-ray images and its labels and pose multi-label classification as a link
prediction problem. Incorporating auxiliary information can then simply be
achieved by adding additional nodes and relations among them. When tested on a
publicly-available radiograph dataset (CheXpert), our relational-reformulation

in 1943, initial measurements showed a wide and confusing variance in density
and other properties. These confusing results were the first clues to the
astounding complexity of plutonium. As this complexity was revealed, it
introduced new challenges for the fabrication of kilogram-scale parts. In a
remarkable period from January 1944 to June 1945, Manhattan Project scientists
made rapid progress in understanding plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. By
early 1945, they had discovered five of the six ambient-pressure phases of
unalloyed plutonium and reported the density of these phases to within a value
of 0.1 g/cm$^3$ of those accepted today. They solved the stability problem
introduced by these phases with a rapid alloy development program that
ultimately identified gallium as the preferred element to stabilize the
delta-phase, producing a plutonium alloy still of scientific and technical
interest today. We conclude with a description of post-war developments in

iteratively until they meet certain constraints, i.e., performance or attribute
requirements. Past work has proposed ways to solve the inverse design problem,
where desired designs are directly generated from specified requirements, thus
avoid the trial and error process. Among those approaches, the conditional deep
generative model shows great potential since 1) it works for complex
high-dimensional designs and 2) it can generate multiple alternative designs
given any condition. In this work, we propose a conditional deep generative
model, Range-GAN, to achieve automatic design synthesis subject to range
constraints. The proposed model addresses the sparse conditioning issue in
data-driven inverse design problems by introducing a label-aware
self-augmentation approach. We also propose a new uniformity loss to ensure
generated designs evenly cover the given requirement range. Through a
real-world example of constrained 3D shape generation, we show that the
label-aware self-augmentation leads to an average improvement of 14% on the
constraint satisfaction for generated 3D shapes, and the uniformity loss leads
to a 125% average increase on the uniformity of generated shapes' attributes.
This work laid the foundation for data-driven inverse design problems where we
consider range constraints and there are sparse regions in the condition space.

learned models for a myriad of classification tasks, from image recognition to
natural speech processing. A quantum advantage arises due to the intractability
of quantum operations on a classical computer. Many datasets used in machine
learning are crowd sourced or contain some private information. To the best of
our knowledge, no current QML models are equipped with privacy-preserving
features, which raises concerns as it is paramount that models do not expose
sensitive information. Thus, privacy-preserving algorithms need to be
implemented with QML. One solution is to make the machine learning algorithm
differentially private, meaning the effect of a single data point on the
training dataset is minimized. Differentially private machine learning models
have been investigated, but differential privacy has yet to be studied in the
context of QML. In this study, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical model that
is trained to preserve privacy using differentially private optimization
algorithm. This marks the first proof-of-principle demonstration of
privacy-preserving QML. The experiments demonstrate that differentially private
QML can protect user-sensitive information without diminishing model accuracy.
Although the quantum model is simulated and tested on a classical computer, it
demonstrates potential to be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum
devices (noisy intermediate-scale quantum [NISQ]). The approach's success is
illustrated via the classification of spatially classed two-dimensional
datasets and a binary MNIST classification. This implementation of
privacy-preserving QML will ensure confidentiality and accurate learning on

Generative models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), have
proven to be effective for design synthesis with applications ranging from
product design to metamaterial design. These automated computational design
methods can support human designers, who typically create designs by a
time-consuming process of iteratively exploring ideas using experience and
heuristics. However, there are still challenges remaining in automatically
synthesizing `creative' designs. GAN models, however, are not capable of
generating unique designs, a key to innovation and a major gap in AI-based
design automation applications. This paper proposes an automated method, named
CreativeGAN, for generating novel designs. It does so by identifying components
that make a design unique and modifying a GAN model such that it becomes more
likely to generate designs with identified unique components. The method
combines state-of-art novelty detection, segmentation, novelty localization,
rewriting, and generative models for creative design synthesis. Using a dataset

and challenging task. Electrochemical methods for harvesting low-grade heat
have attracted research interest in recent years due to the relatively high
effective temperature coefficient of the electrolytes (> 1 mV/K) compared with
the thermopower of traditional thermoelectric devices. Comparing with other
electrochemical devices such as temperature-variation based thermally
regenerative electrochemical cycle and temperature-difference based
thermogalvanic cells, the thermally regenerative flow battery (TRFB) has the
advantages of providing a continuous power output, decoupling the heat source
and heat sink and recuperating heat, and compatible with stacking for scaling
up. However, TRFB suffers from the issue of stable operation due to the
challenge of pH matching between catholyte and anolyte solutions with desirable
temperature coefficients. In this work, we demonstrate a PH-neutral TRFB based
on KI/KI3 and K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 as the catholyte and anolyte, respectively,
with a cell temperature coefficient of 1.9 mV/K and a power density of 9
uW/cm2. This work also presents a comprehensive model with a coupled analysis
of mass transfer and reaction kinetics in a porous electrode that can
accurately capture the flow rate dependence of power density and energy
conversion efficiency. We estimate that the efficiency of the pH-neutral TRFB
can reach 11% of the Carnot efficiency at the maximum power output with a
temperature difference of 37 K. Via analysis, we identify that the mass
transfer overpotential inside the porous electrode and the resistance of the
ion exchange membrane are the two major factors limiting the efficiency and
power density, pointing to directions for future improvements.

However, this paper focuses on the identification of precursors, which is a
relatively newer application. Precursors are events correlated with adverse
events that happen prior to the adverse event itself. Therefore, precursor
mining provides many benefits including understanding the reasons behind a
safety incident and the ability to identify signatures, which can be tracked
throughout a flight to alert the operators of the potential for an adverse
event in the future. This work proposes using the multiple-instance learning
(MIL) framework, a weakly supervised learning task, combined with carefully
designed binary classifier leveraging a Multi-Head Convolutional Neural
Network-Recurrent Neural Network (MHCNN-RNN) architecture. Multi-class
classifiers are then created and compared, enabling the prediction of different
adverse events for any given flight by combining binary classifiers, and by
modifying the MHCNN-RNN to handle multiple outputs. Results obtained showed
that the multiple binary classifiers perform better and are able to accurately
forecast high speed and high path angle events during the approach phase.
Multiple binary classifiers are also capable of determining the aircraft's
parameters that are correlated to these events. The identified parameters can
be considered precursors to the events and may be studied/tracked further to

improvement in the ratio of elastic to inelastic collisions enables direct
thermalization. The thermalization rate depends on the angle between the
collisional axis and the dipole orientation controlled by an external electric
field, a direct manifestation of the anisotropic dipolar interaction. We
achieve evaporative cooling mediated by the dipolar interactions in three

safety-critical software solutions designed with Matlab Simulink. They
incorporate design principles that are typically very hard to verify formally.
In particular, the standard exhaustive formal verification techniques are
unlikely to scale well for the complex designs that are developed in industry.
Furthermore, the Stateflow language lacks a formal semantics, which
additionally hinders the formal analysis.
  To address these challenges, we lay here the foundations of a scalable
technique for provably correct formal analysis of Stateflow models, with
respect to invariant properties, based on bounded model checking (BMC) over
symbolic executions. The crux of our technique is: i) a representation of the
state space of Stateflow models as a symbolic transition system (STS) over the
symbolic configurations of the model, as the basis for BMC, and ii) application
of incremental BMC, to generate verification results after each unrolling of
the next-state relation of the transition system. To this end, we develop a
symbolic structural operational semantics (SSOS) for Stateflow, starting from
an existing structural operational semantics (SOS), and show the preservation
of invariant properties between the two. Next, we define bounded invariant
checking for STS over symbolic configurations as a satisfiability problem. We
develop an automated procedure for generating the initial and next-state
predicates of the STS, and propose an encoding scheme of the bounded invariant
checking problem as a set of constraints, ready for automated analysis with
standard, off-the-shelf satisfiability solvers. Finally, we present preliminary

varied significantly from each other; however, they all used a staggered-grid
and finite difference approximations of the derivatives in the governing
equations, where the first scheme was by von Neumann. These ground-breaking
schemes were principally published in Los Alamos laboratory reports that were

flow configuration for inviscid flow with variations of different inflows as
well as geometric parameters such as inflow Mach number , wedge angles, and
wedge lengths. Few recently published articles reveal an unsteady flow physics
involved with the hypersonic viscous flow for double wedge configuration with
large second wedge angles. However, the reason for such self sustained flow
oscillations is not completely clear. The present work seeks out to investigate
the origin of such oscillations in a low enthalpy hypersonic flow with
different aft wedge angles and wedge length ratios.In the current study,
viscous flow over a double wedge at Mach 7 and fore wedge angle of 30{\deg} is
considered. An improved version of rhoCentralFoam solver in OpenFOAM is used to
investigate the double wedge flow over different grid resolutions in the
separation region and shock shock interaction region. This study corroborates
the observation from the previous literature with an improvement in the range
of parameters which results in a self sustained periodic oscillation. The
present study also suggests that the unsteadiness becomes possible when the
incidence shock is in the proximity of the aft wedge expansion corner as a
consequence of different wedge length ratios(L1/L2) or aft wedge angles
({\theta}2). Flow can still be steady at a large aft wedge angle if the
incidence shock is far ahead of the aft wedge expansion corner.

complexity that most robotic hands do not possess and is therefore of limited
applicability to the robotic hands commonly used today. We discuss these
limitations of the existing grasp modeling literature and set out to develop
our own tools for the analysis of passive effects in robotic grasping. We show
that problems of this kind are difficult to solve due to the non-convexity of
the Maximum Dissipation Principle (MDP), which is part of the Coulomb friction
law. We show that for planar grasps the MDP can be decomposed into a number of
piecewise convex problems, which can be solved for efficiently. [...] Thus, we
present the first polynomial runtime algorithm for the determination of passive
stability of planar grasps. For the spacial case we [...] describe a convex
relaxation of the Coulomb friction law and a successive hierarchical tightening
approach that allows us to find solutions to the exact problem including the
maximum dissipation principle. [...] The generality of our grasp model allows
us to solve a wide variety of problems such as the computation of optimal
actuator commands. This makes our framework a valuable tool for practical
manipulation applications. Our work is relevant beyond robotic manipulation as
it applies to the stability of any assembly of rigid bodies with frictional
contacts, unilateral constraints and externally applied wrenches. Finally, we
argue that with the advent of data-driven methods as well as the emergence of a
new generation of highly sensorized hands there are opportunities for the
application of the traditional grasp modeling theory to fields such as robotic
in-hand manipulation through model-free reinforcement learning. We present a
method that applies traditional grasp models to maintain quasi-static stability
throughout a nominally model-free reinforcement learning task. [...]

knowledge bases. Many data sources are used to extend a given dataset or to

only via Web APIs they also must be included in the integration process.
However, APIs often come with limitations in terms of access frequencies and
speed due to latencies and other constraints. On the other hand, APIs always
provide access to the latest data. So far, integrating APIs has been mainly a
manual task due to the heterogeneity of API responses. To tackle this problem
we present in this paper the FiLiPo (Finding Linkage Points) system which
automatically finds connections (i.e., linkage points) between data provided by
APIs and local knowledge bases. FiLiPo is an open source sample-driven schema
matching system that models API services as parameterized queries. Furthermore,
our approach is able to find valid input values for APIs automatically (e.g.

ten pairs of KBs and APIs show that FiLiPo performs well in terms of precision
and recall and outperforms the current state-of-the-art system.

that the agent will perform well in the face of disturbances to the dynamics or

used to learn policies that are robust to some disturbances in the dynamics and
the reward function. While this capability of MaxEnt RL has been observed
empirically in prior work, to the best of our knowledge our work provides the
first rigorous proof and theoretical characterization of the MaxEnt RL robust
set. While a number of prior robust RL algorithms have been designed to handle
similar disturbances to the reward function or dynamics, these methods
typically require additional moving parts and hyperparameters on top of a base
RL algorithm. In contrast, our results suggest that MaxEnt RL by itself is
robust to certain disturbances, without requiring any additional modifications.
While this does not imply that MaxEnt RL is the best available robust RL
method, MaxEnt RL is a simple robust RL method with appealing formal
guarantees.

distance between a discrete and a generic (possibly non-discrete) probability
measure, are believed to be computationally hard. Even though such problems are
ubiquitous in statistics, machine learning and computer vision, however, this
perception has not yet received a theoretical justification. To fill this gap,
we prove that computing the Wasserstein distance between a discrete probability
measure supported on two points and the Lebesgue measure on the standard
hypercube is already #P-hard. This insight prompts us to seek approximate
solutions for semi-discrete optimal transport problems. We thus perturb the
underlying transportation cost with an additive disturbance governed by an
ambiguous probability distribution, and we introduce a distributionally robust
dual optimal transport problem whose objective function is smoothed with the
most adverse disturbance distributions from within a given ambiguity set. We
further show that smoothing the dual objective function is equivalent to
regularizing the primal objective function, and we identify several ambiguity
sets that give rise to several known and new regularization schemes. As a
byproduct, we discover an intimate relation between semi-discrete optimal
transport problems and discrete choice models traditionally studied in
psychology and economics. To solve the regularized optimal transport problems
efficiently, we use a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with imprecise
stochastic gradient oracles. A new convergence analysis reveals that this
algorithm improves the best known convergence guarantee for semi-discrete
optimal transport problems with entropic regularizers.

wide and deep surveys have improved the census of high-redshift quasars, making
it possible to construct reliable ultraviolet (UV) QLFs at $2\lesssim
z\lesssim6$ down to $M_{1450}=-23$ mag. By parameterizing these up-to-date
observed UV QLFs that are the most extensive in both luminosity and survey area
coverage at a given redshift, we show that the UV QLF has a universal shape,
and their evolution can be approximated by a pure density evolution (PDE). In
order to explain the observed QLF, we construct a model QLF employing the halo
mass function, a number of empirical scaling relations, and the Eddington ratio
distribution. We also include the outshining of AGN over its host galaxy, which
made it possible to reproduce a moderately flat shape of the faint end of the
observed QLF (slope of $\sim-1.1$). This model successfully explains the
observed PDE behavior of UV QLF at $z>2$, meaning that the QLF evolution at
high redshift can be understood under the framework of halo mass function
evolution. The importance of the outshining effect in our model also implies
that there could be a hidden population of faint AGNs ($M_{1450}\gtrsim-24$

use a hollow sphere of plutonium, this design entailed substantial risk, due to
the likelihood of asymmetries resulting from implosion. Christy proposed
changing the design to a solid sphere of plutonium with a modulated neutron
source, and the design was eventually adopted, tested at Trinity, and used in
the attack on Nagasaki. While there is no question regarding the important role
that Christy played in demonstrating its feasibility as a reliable design,
there is a debate as to who initially proposed the idea; though most sources

attributed credit to Christy's group leader, Rudolf Peierls, or indeed other
scientists. This paper seeks to outline and resolve this dispute. We present
new unclassified evidence extracted from previously unavailable sources (to

Christy does deserve the majority of the credit for the invention and design,

Galactic SNRs is expected to be only ${\sim}30\%$, with on order 700 SNRs yet
to be detected. Deep interferometric radio continuum surveys of the Galactic
plane help in rectifying this apparent deficiency by identifying low surface
brightness SNRs and compact SNRs that have not been detected in previous
surveys. However, SNRs are routinely confused with H II regions, which can have
similar radio morphologies. Radio spectral index, polarization, and emission at
mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths can help distinguish between SNRs and H II
regions. Aims. We aim to identify SNR candidates using continuum images from
the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array GLObal view of the STAR formation in the
Milky Way (GLOSTAR) survey. Methods. GLOSTAR is a C-band (4--8 GHz) radio
wavelength survey of the Galactic plane covering $358^{\circ} \leq l \leq
60^{\circ}, |b| \leq 1^{\circ}$. The continuum images from this survey, which
resulted from observations with the most compact configuration of the array,
have an angular resolution of $18''$. We searched for SNRs in these images to
identify known SNRs, previously identified SNR candidates, and new SNR
candidates. We study these objects in MIR surveys and the GLOSTAR polarization
data to classify their emission as thermal or nonthermal. Results. We identify
157 SNR candidates, of which 80 are new. Polarization measurements provide
evidence of nonthermal emission from 9 of these candidates. We find that two
previously identified candidates are filaments. We also detect emission from 91
of the 94 known SNRs in the survey region. Four of these are reclassified as H
II regions following detection in MIR surveys. (Abridged)

energy equipartition in star cluster models with different initial degrees of
anisotropy in the velocity distribution. Our study reveals a number of novel
aspects of the cluster dynamics and shows that the rate of evolution towards
energy equipartition (1) depends on the initial degree of radial velocity
anisotropy -- it is more rapid for more radially anisotropic systems; and (2)
differs for the radial and the tangential components of the velocity
dispersion. (3) The outermost regions of the initially isotropic system evolve
towards a state of `inverted' energy equipartition in which high-mass stars
have a larger velocity dispersion than low-mass stars -- this inversion
originates from the mass-dependence of the tangential velocity dispersion
whereas the radial velocity dispersion shows no anomaly. Our results add new
fundamental elements to the theoretical framework needed to interpret the
wealth of recent and upcoming observational studies of stellar kinematics in
globular clusters, and shed further light on the link between the clusters'
internal kinematics, their formation and evolutionary history.

explosion of massive ($>0.8$ M$_\odot$) carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs),
although the exact mechanism is debated. In some models helium accretion onto a
carbon-oxygen (CO) WD from a companion was suggested to dynamically trigger a
detonation of the accreted helium shell. The helium detonation then produces a
shock that after converging on itself close to the core of the CO-WD, triggers
a secondary carbon detonation and gives rise to an energetic explosion.
However, most studies of such scenarios have been done in one or two
dimensions, and/or did not consider self-consistent models for the accretion
and the He-donor. Here we make use of detailed 3D simulation to study the
interaction of a He-rich hybrid $0.69\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ HeCO WD with a more
massive $0.8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ CO~WD. We find that accretion from the hybrid
WD onto the CO~WD gives rise to a helium detonation. However, the helium
detonation does not trigger a carbon detonation in the CO~WD. Instead, the
helium detonation burns through the accretion stream to also burn the helium
shell of the donor hybrid HeCO-WD. The detonation of its massive helium shell
then compresses its CO core, and triggers its detonation and full destruction.
The explosion gives rise to a faint, likely highly reddened transient,
potentially observable by the Vera Rubin survey, and the high-velocity ($\sim
1000\,\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$) ejection of the heated surviving CO~WD companion.
Pending on uncertainties in stellar evolution we estimate the rate of such
transient to be up to $\sim10\%$ of the rate of type Ia SNe.

reveal one strong emission line, Civ. The line is relatively broad (>3500
km/s), which could indicate that it results from an outflow such as a pulsar
wind. By studying several epochs of X-ray and near-UV data obtained with
XMM-Newton, we find no clear indication that the emission in the two wavebands

investigation of GRGs and, despite the hundreds that are today known, their
main growth catalyst is still debated. One natural explanation for the
exceptional size of GRGs is their old age. In this context, hard X-ray selected
GRGs show evidence of restarting activity, with the giant radio lobes being
mostly disconnected from the nuclear source, if any. In this paper, we present
the serendipitous discovery of a distant ($z=0.629$), medium X-ray selected GRG
in the Bo\""otes field. High-quality, deep Chandra and LOFAR data allow a robust
study of the connection between the nucleus and the lobes, at a larger redshift
so far inaccessible to coded-mask hard X-ray instruments. The radio morphology
of the GRG presented in this work does not show evidence for restarted
activity, and the nuclear radio core spectrum does not appear to be GPS-like.
On the other hand, the X-ray properties of the new GRG are perfectly consistent
with the ones previously studied with Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL at lower redshift.
In particular, the bolometric luminosity measured from the X-ray spectrum is a
factor of six larger than the one derived from the radio lobes, although the
large uncertainties make them formally consistent at $1\sigma$. Finally, the
moderately dense environment around the GRG, traced by the spatial distribution
of galaxies, supports recent findings that the growth of GRGs is not primarily
driven by underdense environments.

combining constraints from experimental searches with different observed final

the monopole moment of the Earth's magnetic field. Using over six years of
public geomagnetic field data obtained by the Swarm satellites, we apply
Gauss's law to measure the total magnetic flux, which is proportional to the
total magnetic charge inside the Earth. To account for the secular variation of
satellite altitudes, we define an altitude-rescaled magnetic flux to reduce the
dominant magnetic dipole contribution. The measured magnetic flux is consistent
with the existing magnetic field model that does not contain a monopole moment
term. We therefore set an upper limit on the magnetic field strength at Earth's
surface from magnetic monopoles to be $|B_{\rm m}| < 0.13$ nT at 95% confidence
level, which is less than $2\times 10^{-6}$ of Earth's magnetic field strength.

superconductor, due to an observed enhancement of the muon spin relaxation at
$T_c$. 4Hb-TaS$_2$ also exhibits a puzzling $T$-linear specific heat at low
temperatures, which is unlikely to be caused by disorder. Elucidating the
origin of this behavior is an essential step in discerning the true nature of
the superconducting ground state. Here, we propose a simple model that
attributes the $T$-linear specific heat to the emergence of a robust multi-band
gapless superconducting state. We show that an extended regime of gapless
superconductivity naturally appears when the pair-breaking scattering rate on
distinct Fermi-surface pockets differs significantly, and the pairing
interaction is predominantly intra-pocket. Using a tight-binding model derived
from first-principle calculations, we show that the pair-breaking scattering
rate promoted by slow magnetic fluctuations on the T layers, which arise from
proximity to a Mott transition, can be significantly different in the various
H-layer dominated Fermi pockets depending on their hybridization with T-layer
states. Thus, our results suggest that the ground state of 4Hb-TaS$_2$ consists
of Fermi pockets displaying gapless superconductivity, which are shunted by
superconducting Fermi pockets that are nearly decoupled from the T-layers.

for all segments, our method produces spatially dependent requirements. We
relate the statistical mean contrast in the coronagraph dark hole to the
standard deviation of the wavefront error of each individual segment on the
primary mirror. This statistical framework for segment-level tolerancing
extends the Pair-based Analytical model for Segmented Telescope Imaging from
Space (PASTIS), which is based uniquely on a matrix multiplication for the
optical propagation. We confirm our analytical results with Monte-Carlo
simulations of E2E optical propagations through a coronagraph. Comparing our
results for the Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph designs for the Large
UltraViolet Optical InfraRed (LUVOIR) telescope to previous studies, we show
general agreement but provide a relaxation of the requirements for a
significant subset of segments. These requirement maps are unique to any given
telescope geometry and coronagraph design. The spatially uncorrelated segment
tolerances we calculate are a key element of a complete error budget that will
also need to include allocations for correlated segment contributions. We
discuss how the PASTIS formalism can be extended to the spatially correlated
case by deriving the statistical mean contrast and its variance for a
non-diagonal aberration covariance matrix. The PASTIS tolerancing framework
therefore brings a new capability that is necessary for the global tolerancing
of future segmented space observatories.

of morphologies in our sample including both regular and irregular dwarf
galaxies. We fit the HST images of the regular galaxies using GALFIT and find
that the majority are disk-dominated with small pseudobulges, although we do
find a handful of bulge-like/elliptical dwarf galaxies. We also find an
unresolved source of light in all of the regular galaxies, which may indicate
the presence of a nuclear star cluster and/or the detection of AGN continuum.
Three of the galaxies in our sample appear to be Magellanic-type dwarf
irregulars and two galaxies exhibit clear signatures of interactions/mergers.
This work demonstrates the diverse nature of dwarf galaxies hosting
optically-selected AGNs. It also has implications for constraining the origin
of the first BH seeds using the local BH occupation fraction at low masses --
we must account for the various types of dwarf galaxies that may host BHs.

chemistry, cell biology, and discrete geometry. Much of the previous work on
hard-particle packings concerns their densest possible arrangements. By
contrast, we examine kinetic effects inevitably present in both numerical and
experimental packing protocols. Specifically, we determine how changing the
compression/shear rate of a two-dimensional packing of noncircular particles
causes it to deviate from its densest possible configuration, which is always
periodic. The adaptive shrinking cell (ASC) optimization scheme maximizes the
packing fraction of a hard-particle packing by first applying random
translations and rotations to the particles and then isotropically compressing
and shearing the simulation box repeatedly until a possibly jammed state is
reached. We use a stochastic implementation of the ASC optimization scheme to
mimic different effective time scales by varying the number of particle moves
between compressions/shears. We generate dense, effectively jammed,
monodisperse, two-dimensional packings of obtuse scalene triangle, rhombus,
curved triangle, lens, and ""ice cream cone"" (a semicircle grafted onto an
isosceles triangle) shaped particles, with a wide range of packing fractions
and degrees of order. To quantify these kinetic effects, we introduce the
kinetic frustration index $K$, which measures the deviation of a packing from
its maximum possible packing fraction. To investigate how kinetics affect
short- and long-range ordering in these packings, we compute their spectral
densities and characterize their contact networks. We find that kinetic effects
are most significant when the particles have greater asphericity, less
curvature, and less rotational symmetry. This work may be relevant to the
design of laboratory packing protocols.

spatial extent that scales sublinearly with $R_{\rm e}$. The incidence of
outflows is enhanced at higher masses, central surface densities and deeper
gravitational potentials, as well as at higher SFR and AGN luminosity. We
quantify strong correlations between mass outflow rates and the mechanical
drivers of the outflow of the form $\dot{M}_{\rm out} \propto \rm SFR^{0.97}$

$M_{\star}$, SFR, $R_{\rm e}$ and $L_{\rm AGN}$. Most of the observed winds are
anticipated to act as galactic fountains, with the fraction of galaxies with
escaping winds increasing with decreasing potential well depth. We further
investigate the physical properties of the outflowing gas finding evidence for
enhanced attenuation in the outflow, possibly due to metal-enriched winds, and
higher excitation compared to the gas in the galactic disk. Given that the
majority of previous studies have focused on more extreme systems with higher
SFRs and/or more luminous AGN, our study provides a unique view of the

relax to a uniform state, local depleted regions quickly form and spread
ballistically throughout the system. We connect this behavior to the

analogue to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation -- which develops
singularities in finite time. Furthermore, we show that the wavefronts of the

led to a surge of development within the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
An important paradigm within AI is reinforcement learning (RL), where agents
interact with environments by exchanging signals via a communication channel.
Agents can learn by updating their behaviour based on obtained feedback. The
crucial question for practical applications is how fast agents can learn to
respond correctly. An essential figure of merit is therefore the learning time.
While various works have made use of quantum mechanics to speed up the agent's
decision-making process, a reduction in learning time has not been demonstrated
yet. Here we present a RL experiment where the learning of an agent is boosted
by utilizing a quantum communication channel with the environment. We further
show that the combination with classical communication enables the evaluation
of such an improvement, and additionally allows for optimal control of the
learning progress. This novel scenario is therefore demonstrated by considering
hybrid agents, that alternate between rounds of quantum and classical
communication. We implement this learning protocol on a compact and fully
tunable integrated nanophotonic processor. The device interfaces with
telecom-wavelength photons and features a fast active feedback mechanism,
allowing us to demonstrate the agent's systematic quantum advantage in a setup
that could be readily integrated within future large-scale quantum

on perturbing the features extracted from the attack traffic to fool the
detection system, however, this may jeopardize the attack's functionality. In
this work, we present TANTRA, a novel end-to-end Timing-based Adversarial
Network Traffic Reshaping Attack that can bypass a variety of NIDSs. Our
evasion attack utilizes a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural network

between the malicious traffic packets (attack), without changing their content,
such that they will ""behave"" like benign network traffic and will not be

and distinct band-limited absorption features, with the first absorption minima
near 20 MHz ($z\sim70$) and the other minima at higher frequencies between
50-110 MHz ($z\sim12-27$) in the global cosmological 21cm signal, which are
signatures of collisional gas dynamics in the cosmic dark ages and
Lyman-$\alpha$ photons from the first stars at cosmic dawn, respectively. A
similar prediction of two distinct band-limited, but stronger, absorption
features is expected in models with excess gas cooling, which have been invoked
to explain the EDGES signal. In this work, we explore a novel mechanism, where
dark matter spin-flip interactions with electrons through a light axial-vector
mediator could directly induce a 21cm absorption signal which is
characteristically different from either of these. We find generically, that
our model predicts a strong, broadband absorption signal extending from
frequencies as low as 1.4 MHz ($z\sim1000$), from early in the cosmic dark ages
where no conventional signal is expected, all the way up to higher frequencies
where star formation and X-ray heating effects are expected to terminate the
absorption signal. In the standard cosmology and in excess gas cooling models
it is expected that the gas spin temperature as inferred from the absorption
signal is a tracer of the gas kinetic temperature. However, in our model we
find in certain regions of parameter space that the spin temperature and
kinetic temperature of the gas evolve differently, and the absorption signal

molecules prepared in the singlet rovibrational ground state are an excellent
candidate for encoding and storing quantum information. However, it is
important to understand all sources of decoherence for these qubits, and then
eliminate them, in order to reach the longest possible coherence times. Here,
we fully characterise the dominant mechanisms for decoherence of a storage
qubit in an optically trapped ultracold gas of RbCs molecules using
high-resolution Ramsey spectroscopy. Guided by a detailed understanding of the
hyperfine structure of the molecule, we tune the magnetic field to where a pair
of hyperfine states have the same magnetic moment. These states form a qubit,
which is insensitive to variations in magnetic field. Our experiments reveal an
unexpected differential tensor light shift between the states, caused by weak
mixing of rotational states. We demonstrate how this light shift can be
eliminated by setting the angle between the linearly polarised trap light and
the applied magnetic field to a magic angle of
$\arccos{(1/\sqrt{3})}\approx55^{\circ}$. This leads to a coherence time
exceeding 6.9 s (90% confidence level). Our results unlock the potential of
ultracold molecules as a platform for quantum computation.

Indeed, Mott and generalized Wigner crystals have been observed in such

two, nearly degenerate species, which can be viewed as two orbitals with
different effective mass and binding energy. Using realistic band-structure
parameters and a slave-rotor mean-field theory, we find that an orbitally

where one band is locked in a commensurate Mott state, while the other remains
itinerant with variable density. This scenario thus, realizes the basic
ingredients in the Kondo lattice model: A periodic lattice of localized
magnetic moments interacting with metallic states. We also discuss possible

higher derivative theories, the field equations can contain terms which are

we formulate a regularization procedure based on representing the delta
function as the limit of a sequence of classical functions. This procedure
involves imposing suitable constraints on the extrinsic curvature such that the

how to obtain the generalized junction conditions for quadratic gravity,
$\mathcal{F}(R)$ theories, a 4D low-energy effective action in string theory
and action terms that are Euler densities. Our results are novel, and refine
the accuracy of previously claimed results in $\mathcal{F} (R)$ theories and
quadratic gravity. In particular, when the coupling constants of quadratic
gravity are those for the Gauss-Bonnet case, our junction conditions reduce to
the known ones for the latter obtained independently by boundary variation of a
surface term in the action. Finally, we briefly discuss a couple of

Large Telescope (VLT) searching for signatures of a residual accretion disk or
intra-binary shock emission, constraining the companion radial velocity
semi-amplitude ($K_2$), and estimating the neutron star mass ($M_{\rm NS}$).
Using the FORS2-VLT intermediate-resolution spectra, we measured a companion
velocity of $291 < K_2 < 348$ km s$^{-1}$ and a binary mass ratio of $0.209 < q
< 0.250$. Combining our results for $K_2$ and $q$, we constrained the mass of
the neutron star and the companion to $(1.0 < M_{\rm NS} < 1.6){\rm
sin}^{-3}i\,M_{\odot}$ and $(0.24 < M_2 < 0.33){\rm sin}^{-3}i\,M_{\odot}$,
respectively, where $i$ is the system inclination. The Doppler map of the
H$\alpha$ emission line exhibits a spot feature at the expected position of the
companion star and an extended bright spot close to the inner Lagrangian point.
We interpret this extended emission as the effect of an intra-binary shock
originating from the interaction between the pulsar relativistic wind and the
matter leaving the companion star. The mass loss from the secondary star could
be either due to Roche-lobe overflow or to the ablation of its outer layer by
the energetic pulsar wind. Contrastingly, we find no evidence for an accretion
disk. We report on the results of the SRT and the LOFAR simultaneous radio
observations at three different frequencies (150 MHz, 336 MHz, and 1400 MHz).
No pulsed radio signal is found in our search. This is probably due to both
scintillation and the presence of material expelled from the system which can
cause the absorption of the radio signal at low frequencies. Finally, we report
on an attempt to search for optical pulsations using IFI+Iqueye mounted at the
1.2 m Galileo telescope at the Asiago Observatory.

coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is one of the most important steps
in moving towards chemical accuracy and, in recent years, its scope has

Here, we show that CCSD theory can also be applied to real metals. In so doing,
we overcome the limitation of needing extremely large supercells to capture
long range electronic correlation effects. An effective Hamiltonian can be
found using the transition structure factor--a map of electronic excitations
from the Hartree--Fock wavefunction--which has fewer finite size effects than
conventional periodic boundary conditions. This not only paves the way of
applying coupled cluster methods to real metals but also reduces the
computational cost by two orders of magnitude compared to previous methods. Our
applications to phases of lithium and silicon show a resounding success in
reaching the thermodynamic limit, taking the first step towards a truly

complexity analysis of practical Monte Carlo Markov chains on continuous state
spaces is quite challenging, and there have been very few successful analyses
of such chains. One fruitful analysis was recently presented by Qin and Hobert
(2021b), who studied a Gibbs sampler for a simple Bayesian random effects
model. These authors showed that, under regularity conditions, the geometric
convergence rate of this Gibbs sampler converges to zero as the data set grows
in size. It is shown herein that similar behavior is exhibited by Gibbs
samplers for more general Bayesian models that possess both random effects and
traditional continuous covariates, the so-called mixed models. The analysis
employs the Wasserstein-based techniques introduced by Qin and Hobert (2021b).

the study population, it is important to compare the characteristics of
compliers and non-compliers. Profiling compliers and non-compliers is necessary
to understand what subpopulation the researcher is making inferences about, and
an important first step in evaluating the external validity (or lack thereof)
of the IV estimate for compliers. Here, we discuss the assumptions necessary
for profiling, which are weaker than the assumptions necessary for identifying
the local average treatment effect if the instrument is randomly assigned. We
then outline a simple and general method to characterize compliers and

brain connectivity, however methods that translate well into a high-dimensional
context (where $p>>n$) are scarce. To this end, we introduce
$\textit{factorized binary search}$ (FaBiSearch), a novel change point
detection method in the network structure of multivariate high-dimensional time
series. FaBiSearch uses non-negative matrix factorization, an unsupervised
dimension reduction technique, and a new binary search algorithm to identify
multiple change points. In addition, we propose a new method for network
estimation for data between change points. We show that FaBiSearch outperforms
another state-of-the-art method on simulated data sets and we apply FaBiSearch
to a resting-state and to a task-based fMRI data set. In particular, for the
task-based data set, we explore network dynamics during the reading of Chapter
9 in $\textit{Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone}$ and find that change
points across subjects coincide with key plot twists. Further, we find that the
density of networks was positively related to the frequency of speech between
characters in the story. Finally, we make all the methods discussed available

volatile-rich asteroids formed in the outer Solar System and may be genetically

spectral properties resemble that of anhydrous cometary dust.
High-angular-resolution images of P-type asteroid (87) Sylvia with VLT/SPHERE
were used to reconstruct its 3D shape, and to study the dynamics of its two
satellites. We also model Sylvia's thermal evolution. The shape of Sylvia
appears flattened and elongated. We derive a volume-equivalent diameter of 271
+/- 5 km, and a low density of 1378 +/- 45 kg.m-3. The two satellites orbit
Sylvia on circular, equatorial orbits. The oblateness of Sylvia should imply a
detectable nodal precession which contrasts with the fully-Keplerian dynamics
of the satellites. This reveals an inhomogeneous internal structure, suggesting
that Sylvia is differentiated. Sylvia's low density and differentiated interior
can be explained by partial melting and mass redistribution through water
percolation. The outer shell would be composed of material similar to
interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) and the core similar to aqueously altered
IDPs or carbonaceous chondrite meteorites such as the Tagish Lake meteorite.
Numerical simulations of the thermal evolution of Sylvia show that for a body
of such size, partial melting was unavoidable due to the decay of long-lived
radionuclides. In addition, we show that bodies as small as 130-150 km in
diameter should have followed a similar thermal evolution, while smaller
objects, such as comets and the KBO Arrokoth, must have remained pristine, in
agreement with in situ observations of these bodies. NASA Lucy mission target
(617) Patroclus (diameter~140 km) may, however, be differentiated.

$\mathbb{F}_p$ with some subspaces $H_1, \dots, H_k$. Let $f \colon G \to
\mathbb{C}$ be a function. Generalizing the notion of Gowers uniformity norms,
Austin introduced directional Gowers uniformity norms of $f$ over $(H_1, \dots,
H_k)$ as \[\|f\|_{\mathsf{U}(H_1, \dots, H_k)}^{2^k} = \mathbb{E}_{x \in G,h_1

$\partial_u f(x) \colon= f(x + u) \overline{f(x)}$ is the discrete
multiplicative derivative.
  Suppose that $G$ is a direct sum of subspaces $G = U_1 \oplus U_2 \oplus
\dots \oplus U_k$. In this paper we prove the inverse theorem for the norm
\[\|\cdot\|_{\mathsf{U}(U_1, \dots, U_k, \smash[b]{\underbrace{{\scriptstyle G,
\dots, G}}_{{\scriptscriptstyle \ell}}})},\] which is the simplest interesting
unknown case of the inverse problem for the directional Gowers uniformity
norms. Namely, writing $\|\cdot\|_{\mathsf{U}}$ for the norm above, we show
that if $f \colon G \to \mathbb{C}$ is a function bounded by 1 in magnitude and
obeying $\|f\|_{\mathsf{U}} \geq c$, provided $\ell < p$, one can find a
polynomial $\alpha \colon G \to \mathbb{F}_p$ of degree at most $k + \ell - 1$
and functions $g_i \colon \oplus_{j \in [k] \setminus \{i\}} G_j \to \{z \in
\mathbb{C} \colon |z| \leq 1\}$ for $i \in [k]$ such that \[\Big|\mathbb{E}_{x

x_{i+1}, \dots, x_k)\Big| \geq
\Big(\exp^{(O_{p,k,\ell}(1))}(O_{p,k,\ell}(c^{-1}))\Big)^{-1}.\]
  The proof relies on an approximation theorem for the cuboid-counting function
that is proved using the inverse theorem for Freiman multi-homomorphisms.

pricing models, such as critical peak pricing (CPP), or surge pricing, and the
demand response models advocated by policy makers and in the power systems
literature.
  The economic analysis in this paper begins with two premises: 1) a meaningful
analysis requires a realistic model of stakeholder/consumer rationality, and 2)
the relationship between electric power and the ultimate use of electricity are
only loosely related in many cases. The most obvious examples are refrigerators
and hot water heaters that consume power intermittently to maintain constant
temperature. Based on a realistic model of user preferences, it is shown that
the use of CPP and related pricing schemes will eventually destabilize the grid
with increased participation. Analysis of this model also leads to a
competitive equilibrium, along with a characterization of the dynamic prices in
this equilibrium. However, we argue that these prices will not lead to a robust
control solution that is acceptable to either grid operators or consumers.
These findings are presented in this paper to alert policy makers of the risk
of implementing real time prices to control our energy grid.
  Competitive equilibrium theory can only provide a caricature of a real-world
market, since complexities such as sunk cost and risk are not included. The
paper explains why these approximations are especially significant in the power
industry. It concludes with policy recommendations to bolster the reliability
of the power grid, with a focus on planning across different timescales and
alternate approaches to leveraging demand-side flexibility in the grid.

entanglement growth are inducing localization via spatial disorder, or
subjecting the system to non-unitary evolution, e.g., via projective
measurements. Here we employ the idea of space-time rotation of a circuit to
explore the relation between systems that fall into these two classes. In
particular, by space-time rotating unitary Floquet circuits that display a
localization transition, we construct non-unitary circuits that display a rich
variety of entanglement scaling and phase transitions. One outcome of our
approach is a non-unitary circuit for free fermions in 1d that exhibits an
entanglement transition from logarithmic scaling to volume-law scaling. This
transition is accompanied by a 'purification transition' analogous to that seen
in hybrid projective-unitary circuits. We follow a similar strategy to
construct a non-unitary 2d Clifford circuit that shows a transition from area
to volume-law entanglement scaling. Similarly, we space-time rotate a 1d spin
chain that hosts many-body localization to obtain a non-unitary circuit that
exhibits an entanglement transition. Finally, we introduce an unconventional
correlator and argue that if a unitary circuit hosts a many-body localization
transition, then the correlator is expected to be singular in its non-unitary
counterpart as well.

methods for automatically detecting demographic information about social media
study populations, including users' age. The objective of this study was to
develop and evaluate a method that automatically identifies the exact age of
users based on self-reports in their tweets. Our end-to-end automatic natural

retrieve tweets that potentially mention an age, a classifier to distinguish
retrieved tweets that self-report the user's exact age (""age"" tweets) and those
that do not (""no age"" tweets), and rule-based extraction to identify the age.
To develop and evaluate ReportAGE, we manually annotated 11,000 tweets that
matched the query patterns. Based on 1000 tweets that were annotated by all
five annotators, inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa) was 0.80 for
distinguishing ""age"" and ""no age"" tweets, and 0.95 for identifying the exact
age among the ""age"" tweets on which the annotators agreed. A deep neural
network classifier, based on a RoBERTa-Large pretrained model, achieved the
highest F1-score of 0.914 (precision = 0.905, recall = 0.942) for the ""age""
class. When the age extraction was evaluated using the classifier's
predictions, it achieved an F1-score of 0.855 (precision = 0.805, recall =
0.914) for the ""age"" class. When it was evaluated directly on the held-out test
set, it achieved an F1-score of 0.931 (precision = 0.873, recall = 0.998) for
the ""age"" class. We deployed ReportAGE on more than 1.2 billion tweets posted
by 245,927 users, and predicted ages for 132,637 (54%) of them. Scaling the
detection of exact age to this large number of users can advance the utility of
social media data for research applications that do not align with the
predefined age groupings of extant binary or multi-class classification

a leader robot leads the follower robots in a team. The leader has specialized
capabilities or mission-critical information (e.g. goal location) that the
followers lack, and this makes the leader crucial for the mission's success.
However, this also makes the leader a vulnerability - an external adversary who
wishes to sabotage the robot team's mission can simply harm the leader and the
whole robot team's mission would be compromised. Since robot motion generated
by traditional leader-follower navigation algorithms can reveal the identity of
the leader, we propose a defense mechanism of hiding the leader's identity by
ensuring the leader moves in a way that behaviorally camouflages it with the
followers, making it difficult for an adversary to identify the leader. To
achieve this, we combine Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural
Networks and adversarial training. Our approach enables the multi-robot team to
optimize the primary task performance with leader motion similar to follower
motion, behaviorally camouflaging it with the followers. Our algorithm
outperforms existing work that tries to hide the leader's identity in a
multi-robot team by tuning traditional leader-follower control parameters with
Classical Genetic Algorithms. We also evaluated human performance in inferring
the leader's identity and found that humans had lower accuracy when the robot
team used our proposed navigation algorithm.

agility and mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), RIS can be mounted on
UAVs to enable three-dimensional signal reflection. Compared to the
conventional terrestrial RIS (TRIS), the aerial RIS (ARIS) enjoys higher
deployment flexibility, reliable air-to-ground links, and panoramic full-angle
reflection. However, due to UAV's limited payload and battery capacity, it is
difficult for a UAV to carry a RIS with a large number of reflecting elements.
Thus, the scalability of the aperture gain could not be guaranteed. In
practice, multiple UAVs can form a UAV swarm to enable the ARIS cooperatively.
In this article, we first present an overview of the UAV swarm-enabled ARIS

We then address the critical challenges of designing the SARIS by focusing on
the beamforming design, SARIS channel estimation, and SARIS's deployment and
movement. Next, the potential performance enhancement of SARIS is showcased and

key factor to disease understanding and treatment development, so that
interventions can be tailored to target the subgroups that will benefit most
from the treatment, which is an important goal of precision medicine. However,
in practice, one top methodological challenge hindering the heterogeneity
investigation is that the true subgroup membership of each individual is often
unknown. In this article, we aim to identify latent subgroups of individuals
who share a common disorder progress over time, to predict latent subgroup
memberships, and to estimate and infer the heterogeneous trajectories among the
subgroups. To achieve these goals, we apply a concave fusion learning method
proposed in Ma and Huang (2017) and Ma et al. (2019) to conduct subgroup
analysis for longitudinal trajectories of the Alzheimer's disease data. The
heterogeneous trajectories are represented by subject-specific unknown
functions which are approximated by B-splines. The concave fusion method can
simultaneously estimate the spline coefficients and merge them together for the
subjects belonging to the same subgroup to automatically identify subgroups and
recover the heterogeneous trajectories. The resulting estimator of the disease
trajectory of each subgroup is supported by an asymptotic distribution. It
provides a sound theoretical basis for further conducting statistical inference
in subgroup analysis..

the tendency of the algorithm to favor a few popular items while

various approaches for mitigating popularity bias and enhancing the
recommendation of long-tail, less popular, items. The effectiveness of these
approaches is often assessed using different metrics to evaluate the extent to
which over-concentration on popular items is reduced. However, not much
attention has been given to the user-centered evaluation of this bias; how
different users with different levels of interest towards popular items are
affected by such algorithms. In this paper, we show the limitations of the
existing metrics to evaluate popularity bias mitigation when we want to assess
these algorithms from the users' perspective and we propose a new metric that
can address these limitations. In addition, we present an effective approach

we investigate several state-of-the-art approaches proposed in recent years to
mitigate popularity bias and evaluate their performances using the existing

PANTHER plans trajectories that avoid dynamic obstacles while also keeping them
in the sensor field of view (FOV) and minimizing the blur to aid in object

allows PANTHER to fully exploit the differential flatness of multirotors to
maximize the PA objective. Real-time performance is achieved by implicitly
imposing the underactuated dynamics of the UAV through the Hopf fibration.
PANTHER is able to keep the obstacles inside the FOV 7.9 and 1.5 times more

respectively. The projected velocity (and hence the blur) is reduced by 18% and
34%, respectively. This leads to average success rates three times larger than

basis is used to impose low-conservative collision avoidance constraints in
position and velocity space. Finally, extensive hardware experiments in unknown

result, SDQL enables efficient processing of hybrid DB and LA workloads, by
putting together optimizations that are otherwise confined to either DB systems

properties. Experiments demenstrate that Vec2vec is more efficient than several
state-of-the-art local dimensionality reduction methods in a large number of
high-dimensional data. Extensive experiments of data classification and

of Things (IoT) applications. It helps to process data close to the users, in
order to deliver faster processing outcomes than the Cloud; it also helps to
reduce network traffic. The computation environment in the Fog computing is
highly dynamic and most of the Fog devices are battery powered hence the
chances of application failure is high which leads to delaying the application
outcome. On the other hand, if we rerun the application in other devices after
the failure it will not comply with time-sensitiveness. To solve this problem,
we need to run applications in an energy-efficient manner which is a
challenging task due to the dynamic nature of Fog computing environment. It is
required to schedule application in such a way that the application should not
fail due to the unavailability of energy. In this paper, we propose a multiple
linear, regression-based resource allocation mechanism to run applications in
an energy-aware manner in the Fog computing environment to minimise failures
due to energy constraint. Prior works lack of energy-aware application
execution considering dynamism of Fog environment. Hence, we propose A multiple
linear regression-based approach which can achieve such objectives. We present
a sustainable energy-aware framework and algorithm which execute applications
in Fog environment in an energy-aware manner. The trade-off between
energy-efficient allocation and application execution time has been
investigated and shown to have a minimum negative impact on the system for
energy-aware allocation. We compared our proposed method with existing
approaches. Our proposed approach minimises the delay and processing by 20%,
and 17% compared with the existing one. Furthermore, SLA violation decrease by
57% for the proposed energy-aware allocation.

generally applicable to context-based meta-RL algorithms. It accelerates the

methods have shown high accuracy as closure models in simulations of turbulent

interpretability, wherein they provide answers but no insight into their
underlying rationale. The objective of this study is to assess SGS stress
models from conventional physics-driven approaches and an interpretable machine
learning algorithm, i.e., the random forest regressor, in a turbulent

(DNS) of transcritical liquid-oxygen/gaseous-methane (LOX/GCH4) inert and

on the Favre-filtered DNS data to examine the accuracy of physics-based and
random forest SGS-models under these conditions. SGS stresses calculated with
the gradient model show good agreement with the exact terms extracted from
filtered DNS. The accuracy of the random-forest regressor decreased when
physics-based constraints are applied to the feature set. Results demonstrate
that random forests can perform as effectively as algebraic models when
modeling subgrid stresses, only when trained on a sufficiently representative

reinforcement learning (RL) agents and show, empirically, that it's possible to
know a priori if a state representation will lend itself to fast learning. RL
agents in high-dimensional states have two main learning burdens: (1) to learn
an action-selection policy and (2) to learn to discern between useful and
non-useful information in a given state. By learning a latent representation of
these high-dimensional states with an auxiliary model, the latter burden is
effectively removed, thereby leading to accelerated training progress. We
examine this phenomenon across tasks in the PyBullet Kuka environment, where an
agent must learn to control a robotic gripper to pick up an object. Our
analysis reveals how neural network policies learn to organize their internal
representation of the state space throughout training. The results from this
analysis provide three main insights into how deep RL agents learn. First, a
well-organized internal representation within the policy network is a
prerequisite to learning good action-selection. Second, a poor initial
representation can cause an unrecoverable collapse within a policy network.
Third, a good initial representation allows an agent's policy network to
organize its internal representation even before any training begins.

(BS) that is serving multiple real-time traffic streams forwarding information
updates to their destinations in order to sustain the freshness of information
for time-critical applications. Since the wireless channels may be unreliable
due to the impurities of the propagation environments, such as deep fading,
blockages, etc., we integrate a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to the
wireless system in order to mitigate the propagation-induced impairments,
enhance the quality of the wireless links, and ensure that the required
freshness of information is achieved for these real-time applications. For this
network set-up, we investigate the joint optimization of the traffic streams
scheduling and the RIS phase-shift matrix with the goal of minimizing the
long-term average Age of Information (AoI). The formulated optimization problem
is a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, which is difficult to
solve. To circumvent the high-coupled optimization variables, and with the aid
of bilevel optimization, we decompose the original problem into an outer
traffic stream scheduling problem and an inner RIS phase-shift matrix problem.
For the outer problem, owing to its complexity and stochastic nature of packet
arrivals, we resort to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution where the
traffic stream scheduling is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is invoked to solve it. Whereas, the inner
problem that determines the RIS configuration is solved through semi-definite
relaxation (SDR). Finally, we show through extensive simulations that our
approach evaluates the combined impact of scheduling policy and RIS
configuration on the long-term average AoI, where we demonstrate its
superiority against other baseline schemes.

Analysis (PCA) -- is one of the most popular approaches for dimensionality
reduction in signal processing and machine learning. But centralized PSA/PCA
solutions are fast becoming irrelevant in the modern era of big data, in which
the number of samples and/or the dimensionality of samples often exceed the
storage and/or computational capabilities of individual machines. This has led
to the study of distributed PSA/PCA solutions, in which the data are
partitioned across multiple machines and an estimate of the principal subspace
is obtained through collaboration among the machines. It is in this vein that
this paper revisits the problem of distributed PSA/PCA under the general
framework of an arbitrarily connected network of machines that lacks a central
server. The main contributions of the paper in this regard are threefold.
First, two algorithms are proposed in the paper that can be used for
distributed PSA/PCA, with one in the case of data partitioned across samples
and the other in the case of data partitioned across (raw) features. Second, in
the case of sample-wise partitioned data, the proposed algorithm and a variant
of it are analyzed, and their convergence to the true subspace at linear rates
is established. Third, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
data are carried out to validate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms. In
particular, in the case of sample-wise partitioned data, an MPI-based
distributed implementation is carried out to study the interplay between
network topology and communications cost as well as to study the effects of
straggler machines on the proposed algorithms.

study the doped two-orbital Hubbard model for the two-leg ladder BaFe$_2$S$_3$.
The model is constructed by using {\it ab initio} hopping parameters and the
ground state properties are investigated using the density matrix
renormalization group method. We show that the $(\pi,0)$ magnetic ordering at
half-filling, with ferromagnetic rungs and antiferromagnetic legs, becomes
incommensurate upon hole doping. Moreover, depending on the strength of the
Hubbard $U$ coupling, other magnetic patterns, such as $(0,\pi)$, are also
stabilized. We found that the binding energy for two holes becomes negative for
intermediate Hubbard interaction strength, indicating hole pairing. Due to the
crystal-field split among orbitals, the holes primarily reside in one orbital,
with the other one remaining half-filled. This resembles orbital selective Mott
states. The formation of tight hole pairs continues with increasing hole
density, as long as the magnetic order remains antiferromagnetic in one
direction. The study of pair-pair correlations indicates the dominance of the
intra-orbital spin-singlet channel, as opposed to other pairing channels.
Although in a range of hole doping pairing correlations decay slowly, our
results can also be interpreted as corresponding to a charge-density-wave made
of pairs, a precursor of eventual superconductivity after interladder couplings
are included. Such scenario of intertwined orders has been extensively
discussed before in the cuprates, and our results suggest a similar physics
could exist in ladder iron-based superconductors. Finally, we also show that a
robust Hund's coupling is needed for pairing to occur.

structural equations of motion simultaneously for strongly enforcing the
no-slip constraint on the body. Handling this constraint requires solving
several large dimensional systems that scale by the number of grid points in
the flow domain even though the nonlinear constraints scale only by the small
number of points used to represent the fluid-structure interface. These costly
large scale operations for determining only a small number of unknowns at the
interface creates a bottleneck to efficiently time-advancing strongly coupled
IB methods. In this manuscript, we present a remedy for this bottleneck that is
motivated by the efficient strategy employed in stationary-body IB methods
while preserving the favorable stability properties of strongly coupled
algorithms -- we precompute a matrix that encapsulates the large dimensional
system so that the prohibitive large scale operations need not be performed at
every time step. This precomputation process yields a modified system of
small-dimensional constraint equations that is solved at minimal computational
cost while time advancing the equations. We also present a parallel
implementation that scales favorably across multiple processors. The accuracy,
computational efficiency and scalability of our approach are demonstrated on
several two dimensional flow problems. Although the demonstration problems
consist of a combination of rigid and torsionally mounted bodies, the
formulation is derived in a more general setting involving an arbitrary number
of rigid, torsionally mounted, and continuously deformable bodies.

Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and residual learning for accurate and
robust liver CT segmentation, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was
tested on two public datasets LiTS17 and SLiver07.
  Methods: A new network architecture called SAR-U-Net was designed. Firstly,
the SE block is introduced to adaptively extract image features after each
convolution in the U-Net encoder, while suppressing irrelevant regions, and
highlighting features of specific segmentation task; Secondly, ASPP was
employed to replace the transition layer and the output layer, and acquire
multi-scale image information via different receptive fields. Thirdly, to
alleviate the degradation problem, the traditional convolution block was
replaced with the residual block and thus prompt the network to gain accuracy
from considerably increased depth.
  Results: In the LiTS17 experiment, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD, ASD and
MSD were 95.71, 9.52, -0.84, 1.54 and 29.14, respectively. Compared with other

  Conclusion: The proposed model enables a great improvement on the accuracy

in an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS)-enabled wireless network. In
particular, the users dynamically select different Service Providers (SPs) and
network services over time. The network services are composed of IRS resources
and transmit power resources. To formulate the SP and network service
selection, we adopt an evolutionary game in which the users are able to adapt
their network selections depending on the utilities that they achieve. For
this, the replicator dynamics is used to model the service selection adaptation
of the users. To allow the users to take their past service experiences into
account their decisions, we further adopt an enhanced version of the
evolutionary game, namely fractional evolutionary game, to study the SP and
network service selection. The fractional evolutionary game incorporates the
memory effect that captures the users' memory on their decisions. We
theoretically prove that both the game approaches have a unique equilibrium.
Finally, we provide numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed game approaches. In particular, we have reveal some important finding,
for instance, with the memory effect, the users can achieve the utility higher
than that without the memory effect

diseases and the choroid can be imaged using spectral-domain optical coherence
tomography (SDOCT) and enhanced depth imaging OCT (EDIOCT). New Method: Eighty
macular SDOCT volumes from 80 patients were obtained using the Zeiss Cirrus
machine. Eleven additional control subjects had two Cirrus scans done in one
visit along with EDIOCT using the Heidelberg Spectralis machine. To
automatically segment choroidal layers from the OCT volumes, our
graph-theoretic approach was utilized. The segmentation results were compared
with reference standards from two graders, and the accuracy of automated
segmentation was calculated using unsigned to signed border positioning
thickness errors and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The repeatability and
reproducibility of our choroidal thicknesses were determined by intraclass
correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), and repeatability
coefficient (RC). Results: The mean unsigned to signed border positioning
errors for the choroidal inner and outer surfaces are 3.39plusminus1.26microns
(mean plusminus SD) to minus1.52 plusminus 1.63microns and 16.09 plusminus
6.21microns to 4.73 plusminus 9.53microns, respectively. The mean unsigned to
signed choroidal thickness errors are 16.54 plusminus 6.47microns to 6.25

converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium and can handle continuous actions,
it may take an exponential number of iterations as the number of information

extensive-form double oracle algorithm for two-player zero-sum games that is
guaranteed to converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium linearly in the
number of infostates. Unlike PSRO, which mixes best responses at the root of
the game, XDO mixes best responses at every infostate. We also introduce Neural
XDO (NXDO), where the best response is learned through deep RL. In tabular
experiments on Leduc poker, we find that XDO achieves an approximate Nash
equilibrium in a number of iterations an order of magnitude smaller than PSRO.
Experiments on a modified Leduc poker game and Oshi-Zumo show that tabular XDO
achieves a lower exploitability than CFR with the same amount of computation.
We also find that NXDO outperforms PSRO and NFSP on a sequential
multidimensional continuous-action game. NXDO is the first deep RL method that

We consider a restricted diffusion problem where the flux across the interface
depends on its conductance and the difference of the concentration on each
side. The diffusive interface phase-field framework used here has several
advantages over the sharp interface method. First of all, explicit tracking of
the interface is no longer necessary. Secondly, the interfacial condition can
be incorporated with a variable diffusion coefficient. A detailed asymptotic
analysis confirms the diffusive interface model converges to the existing sharp
interface model as the interface thickness goes to zero. A decoupled energy
stable numerical scheme is developed to solve this system efficiently.
Numerical simulations first illustrate the consistency of theoretical results
on the sharp interface limit. Then a convergence study and energy decay test
are conducted to ensure the efficiency and stability of the numerical scheme.
To illustrate the effectiveness of our phase-field approach, several examples
are provided, including a study of a two-phase mass transfer problem where
drops with deformable interfaces are suspended in a moving fluid.

we observe that there are three ""drivers"" that impose requirements on spatially
intelligent agents and thus VPR systems: 1) the particular agent including its
sensors and computational resources, 2) the operating environment of this
agent, and 3) the specific task that the artificial agent carries out. In this
paper, we characterize and survey key works in the VPR area considering those
drivers, including their place representation and place matching choices. We
also provide a new definition of VPR based on the visual overlap -- akin to
spatial view cells in the brain -- that enables us to find similarities and
differences to other research areas in the robotics and computer vision fields.
We identify numerous open challenges and suggest areas that require more

the research question of what types of student skills would impact future
trends across subjects. However, few studies have focused on long-term data.
This is because the criteria of examinations vary depending on their designers;
additionally, it is difficult for the same designer to maintain the coherence
of the criteria of examinations beyond grades. To solve this inconsistency
issue, we propose a novel approach to extract candidate factors affecting
long-term trends across subjects from long-term data. Our approach is composed
of three steps: Data screening, time series clustering, and causal inference.
The first step extracts coherence data from long-term data. The second step
groups the long-term data by shape and value. The third step extracts factors
affecting the long-term trends and validates the extracted variation factors
using two or more different data sets. We then conducted evaluation experiments
with student achievement data from five public elementary schools and four
public junior high schools in Japan. The results demonstrate that our approach
extracts coherence data, clusters long-term data into interpretable groups, and
extracts candidate factors affecting academic ability across subjects.
Subsequently, our approach formulates a hypothesis and turns archived
achievement data into useful information.

caused by the reacceleration and compression of multiple aged electron
populations from historic active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, so-called
`radio phoenix', by an as yet undetected weak cluster-scale mechanism. The USS
Jellyfish adds to a growing number of radio phoenix in cool-core clusters with
unknown reacceleration mechanisms; as the first example of a polyphoenix,
however, this implies the mechanism is on the scale of the cluster itself.
Indeed, we show that in simulations, emission akin to the USS Jellyfish can be
produced as a short-lived, transient phase in the evolution of multiple
interacting AGN remnants when subject to weak external shocks.

demonstrating how to construct a time-dependent random walk sharing the exact

is far stronger than simply considering quantum walks as quantum analogues of
random walks. This article expands on the connection between quantum and random
walks by demonstrating a procedure that constructs a time-dependent quantum
walk matching the evolution of vertex probability of any given random walk in a
unitary way. It is a trivial fact that a quantum walk measured at all time
steps of its evolution degrades to a random walk. More interestingly, the
method presented describes a quantum walk that matches a random walk without
measurement operations, such that the unitary evolution of the quantum walk
captures the probability evolution of the random walk. The construction
procedure is general, covering both homogeneous and non-homogeneous random
walks. For the homogeneous random walk case, the properties of unitary
evolution imply that the quantum walk described is time-dependent since
homogeneous quantum walks do not converge for arbitrary initial conditions

positioning to achieve successful grasps and transmit large contact forces that
may destabilize the drone. This limits the speed during grasping and prevents
""dynamic grasping"", where the drone attempts to grasp an object while moving.
On the other hand, biological systems (e.g., birds) rely on compliant and soft
parts to dampen contact forces and compensate for grasping inaccuracy, enabling
impressive feats. This paper presents the first prototype of a soft drone -- a
quadrotor where traditional (i.e., rigid) landing gears are replaced with a
soft tendon-actuated gripper to enable aggressive grasping. We provide three
key contributions. First, we describe our soft drone prototype, including
electro-mechanical design, software infrastructure, and fabrication. Second, we
review the set of algorithms we use for trajectory optimization and control of
the drone and the soft gripper; the algorithms combine state-of-the-art
techniques for quadrotor control (i.e., an adaptive geometric controller) with
advanced soft robotics models (i.e., a quasi-static finite element model).
Finally, we evaluate our soft drone in physics simulations (using SOFA and
Unity) and in real tests in a motion-capture room. Our drone is able to
dynamically grasp objects of unknown shape where baseline approaches fail. Our
physical prototype ensures consistent performance, achieving 91.7% successful
grasps across 23 trials. We showcase dynamic grasping results in the video

cornerstone of classical statistics. Despite being only asymptotically valid,
they are ubiquitous because they permit statistical inference under very weak
assumptions, and can often be applied to problems even when nonasymptotic
inference is impossible. This paper introduces time-uniform analogues of such
asymptotic confidence intervals. To elaborate, our methods take the form of
confidence sequences (CS) -- sequences of confidence intervals that are
uniformly valid over time. CSs provide valid inference at arbitrary stopping
times, incurring no penalties for ""peeking"" at the data, unlike classical
confidence intervals which require the sample size to be fixed in advance.
Existing CSs in the literature are nonasymptotic, and hence do not enjoy the
aforementioned broad applicability of asymptotic confidence intervals. Our work
bridges the gap by giving a definition for ""asymptotic CSs"", and deriving a
universal asymptotic CS that requires only weak CLT-like assumptions. While the
CLT approximates the distribution of a sample average by that of a Gaussian at
a fixed sample size, we use strong invariance principles (stemming from the
seminal 1960s work of Strassen and improvements by Koml\'os, Major, and
Tusn\'ady) to uniformly approximate the entire sample average process by an
implicit Gaussian process. We demonstrate their utility by deriving
nonparametric asymptotic CSs for the average treatment effect based on doubly
robust estimators in observational studies, for which no nonasymptotic methods
can exist even in the fixed-time regime. This enables causal inference that can
be continuously monitored and adaptively stopped.

the secondary market, and the composition of the workforce are the main factors
in explaining the flattening of the Phillips curve. We argue that the changes
we consider in the model, in fact, has plausibly made the Phillips curve flat
in recent years.

the shock is unbounded. Most dynamic economic models lack a closed-form
solution. As such, approximate solutions by numerical methods are utilized.
Since the researcher cannot directly evaluate the exact policy function and the
associated exact likelihood, it is imperative that the approximate likelihood
asymptotically converges -- as well as to know the conditions of convergence --
to the exact likelihood, in order to justify and validate its usage. In this
regard, Fernandez-Villaverde, Rubio-Ramirez, and Santos (2006) show convergence
of the likelihood, when the shock has compact support. However, compact support
implies that the shock is bounded, which is not an assumption met in most
dynamic economic models, e.g., with normally distributed shocks. This paper
provides theoretical justification for most dynamic models used in the
literature by showing the conditions for convergence of the approximate
invariant measure obtained from numerical simulations to the exact invariant
measure, thus providing the conditions for convergence of the likelihood.

develop locomotion controllers for quadruped robots. Common approaches have
largely focused on learning actions directly in joint space, or learning to
modify and offset foot positions produced by trajectory generators. Both
approaches typically require careful reward shaping and training for millions
of time steps, and with trajectory generators introduce human bias into the
resulting control policies. In this paper, we present a learning framework that
leads to the natural emergence of fast and robust bounding policies for
quadruped robots. The agent both selects and controls actions directly in task
space to track desired velocity commands subject to environmental noise
including model uncertainty and rough terrain. We observe that this framework
improves sample efficiency, necessitates little reward shaping, leads to the
emergence of natural gaits such as galloping and bounding, and eases the
sim-to-real transfer at running speeds. Policies can be learned in only a few
million time steps, even for challenging tasks of running over rough terrain
with loads of over 100% of the nominal quadruped mass. Training occurs in
PyBullet, and we perform a sim-to-sim transfer to Gazebo and sim-to-real
transfer to the Unitree A1 hardware. For sim-to-sim, our results show the
quadruped is able to run at over 4 m/s without a load, and 3.5 m/s with a 10 kg

  Reconstruction",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning has shown impressive performance on challenging perceptual
tasks and has been widely used in software to provide intelligent services.
However, researchers found deep neural networks vulnerable to adversarial
examples. Since then, many methods are proposed to defend against adversaries
in inputs, but they are either attack-dependent or shown to be ineffective with
new attacks. And most of existing techniques have complicated structures or
mechanisms that cause prohibitively high overhead or latency, impractical to
apply on real software.
  We propose DAFAR, a feedback framework that allows deep learning models to
detect/purify adversarial examples in high effectiveness and universality, with
low area and time overhead. DAFAR has a simple structure, containing a victim
model, a plug-in feedback network, and a detector. The key idea is to import
the high-level features from the victim model's feature extraction layers into
the feedback network to reconstruct the input. This data stream forms a
feedback autoencoder. For strong attacks, it transforms the imperceptible
attack on the victim model into the obvious reconstruction-error attack on the
feedback autoencoder directly, which is much easier to detect; for weak
attacks, the reformation process destroys the structure of adversarial
examples. Experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 data-sets, showing
that DAFAR is effective against popular and arguably most advanced attacks
without losing performance on legitimate samples, with high effectiveness and
universality across attack methods and parameters.

electrically isolated from external electrodes by thick insulating barriers.
This design permits full control of the total and differential densities of two
coupled 2D electron systems. The floating bilayer design provides a unique
approach for studying systems inaccessible by simple transport measurements. It
also provides the ability to measure the charge transfer between the layers,
even when the in-plane resistivities of the 2D systems diverge. We measure the
capacitance and inter-layer tunneling spectra of the QW bilayer with
independent control of the top and bottom layer electron densities. Our
measurements display strongly enhanced inter-layer tunneling current at the
total filling factor of 1, a signature of exciton condensation of a strongly

and transforming politics into a zero-sum game. Ideological polarization - the
extent to which political views are widely dispersed - is already strong among
elites, but less so among the general public (McCarty, 2019, p. 50-68). Strong
mutual distrust and hostility between Democrats and Republicans in the U.S.,
combined with the elites' already strong ideological polarization, could lead
to increasing ideological polarization among the public. The paper addresses
two questions: (1) Is there a level of ideological polarization above which
polarization feeds upon itself to become a runaway process? (2) If so, what
policy interventions could prevent such dangerous positive feedback loops? To
explore these questions, we present an agent-based model of ideological
polarization that differentiates between the tendency for two actors to
interact (exposure) and how they respond when interactions occur, positing that
interaction between similar actors reduces their difference while interaction
between dissimilar actors increases their difference. Our analysis explores the
effects on polarization of different levels of tolerance to other views,
responsiveness to other views, exposure to dissimilar actors, multiple
ideological dimensions, economic self-interest, and external shocks. The
results suggest strategies for preventing, or at least slowing, the development
of extreme polarization.

the Lagrange multipliers in the augmented Lagrangian of the original problem by
Lagrange multiplier functions. The expressions of these Lagrange multiplier
functions, which depend upon the gradients of the objective function and the
constraints, can make the unconstrained penalty function non-convex in general
even if the original problem is convex. We establish sufficient conditions on
the objective function and the constraints of the original problem under which
the unconstrained penalty function is convex. This enables us to use Nesterov's
accelerated gradient method for unconstrained convex optimization and achieve a

how to effectively model linguistic rules in end-to-end deep networks remains a

Correspondingly, we propose an autonomous, bidirectional and iterative ABINet
for scene text recognition. Firstly, the autonomous suggests to block gradient
flow between vision and language models to enforce explicitly language
modeling. Secondly, a novel bidirectional cloze network (BCN) as the language
model is proposed based on bidirectional feature representation. Thirdly, we
propose an execution manner of iterative correction for language model which
can effectively alleviate the impact of noise input. Additionally, based on the
ensemble of iterative predictions, we propose a self-training method which can
learn from unlabeled images effectively. Extensive experiments indicate that
ABINet has superiority on low-quality images and achieves state-of-the-art

nuclei (AGN) are tracers of ionized outflows located at parsec scale distances
from the central engine. If the smallest inferred ionization parameters
correspond to plasma at a few $10^4$~K, then the gas undergoes a transition
from being bound to unbound provided it is further heated to $\sim 10^6$~K at
larger radii. Dannen et al. recently discovered that under these circumstances,
thermally driven wind solutions are unsteady and even show very dense clumps
due to thermal instability. To explore the observational consequences of these
new wind solutions, we compute line profiles based on the one-dimensional
simulations of Dannen et al. We show how the line profiles from even a simple
steady state wind solution depend on the ionization energy (IE) of absorbing
ions, which is a reflection of the wind ionization stratification. To organize
the diversity of the line shapes, we group them into four categories: weak
Gaussians, saturated boxy profiles with and without an extended blue wing, and
broad weak profiles. The lines with profiles in the last two categories are
produced by ions with the highest IE that probe the fastest regions. Their
maximum blueshifts agree with the highest flow velocities in thermally unstable
models, both steady state and clumpy versions. In contrast, the maximum
blueshifts of the most high IE lines in thermally stable models can be less
than half of the actual solution velocities. Clumpy solutions can additionally

research area in computer vision. Existing deep learning methods for this task
rely on high-resolution input, which however, is not always available in many
scenarios such as video surveillance and sports broadcasting. Two common
approaches to deal with low-resolution images are applying super-resolution
techniques to the input, which may result in unpleasant artifacts, or simply
training one model for each resolution, which is impractical in many realistic
applications.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called
RSC-Net, which consists of a Resolution-aware network, a Self-supervision loss,
and a Contrastive learning scheme. The proposed method is able to learn 3D body
pose and shape across different resolutions with one single model. The
self-supervision loss enforces scale-consistency of the output, and the
contrastive learning scheme enforces scale-consistency of the deep features. We
show that both these new losses provide robustness when learning in a
weakly-supervised manner. Moreover, we extend the RSC-Net to handle
low-resolution videos and apply it to reconstruct textured 3D pedestrians from
low-resolution input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RSC-Net can
achieve consistently better results than the state-of-the-art methods for
challenging low-resolution images.

models for document search, the relevance-efficiency tradeoff remains a
critical problem for ad-hoc ranking. To overcome this challenge, this paper
presents BECR (BERT-based Composite Re-Ranking), a composite re-ranking scheme
that combines deep contextual token interactions and traditional lexical
term-matching features. In particular, BECR exploits a token encoding mechanism
to decompose the query representations into pre-computable uni-grams and
skip-n-grams. By applying token encoding on top of a dual-encoder architecture,
BECR separates the attentions between a query and a document while capturing
the contextual semantics of a query. In contrast to previous approaches, this
framework does not perform expensive BERT computations during online inference.
Thus, it is significantly faster, yet still able to achieve high
competitiveness in ad-hoc ranking relevance. Finally, an in-depth comparison
between BECR and other start-of-the-art neural ranking baselines is described
using the TREC datasets, thereby further demonstrating the enhanced relevance
and efficiency of BECR.

accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to interact with their host galaxies
and clusters. Properties of the outflows are however poorly constrained due to
the lack of kinetically resolved data of the hot plasma that permeates the
circumgalactic and intracluster space. In this work, we use a single parameter,
outflow-to-accretion mass-loading factor $m=\dot{M}_{\rm out}/\dot{M}_{\rm
BH}$, to characterize the outflows that mediate the interaction between SMBHs
and their hosts. By modeling both M87 and Perseus, and comparing the simulated
thermal profiles with the X-ray observations of these two systems, we
demonstrate that $m$ can be constrained between $200-500$. This parameter
corresponds to a bulk flow speed between $4,000-7,000\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ at
around 1 kpc, and a thermalized outflow temperature between
$10^{8.7}-10^{9}\,{\rm K}$. Our results indicate that the dominant outflow
speeds in giant elliptical galaxies and clusters are much lower than in the
close vicinity of the SMBH, signaling an efficient coupling with and
deceleration by the surrounding medium on length scales below 1 kpc.
Consequently, AGNs may be efficient at launching outflows $\sim10$ times more
massive than previously uncovered by measurements of cold, obscuring material.
We also examine the mass and velocity distribution of the cold gas, which
ultimately forms a rotationally supported disk in simulated clusters. The
rarity of such disks in observations indicates that further investigations are
needed to understand the evolution of the cold gas after it forms.

has attracted tremendous interest in the past years. While the transition
temperature (Tc) of bulk FeSe is $\sim$ 8 K, it can be significantly enhanced
to 40 - 50 K by various ways of electron doping. However, the underlying
physics for such great enhancement of Tc and so the Cooper pairing mechanism
still remain puzzles. Here, we report a systematic study of the
superconducting- and normal-state properties of FeSe films via ionic liquid
gating. With fine tuning, Tc evolves continuously from below 10 K to above 40
K; in situ two-coil mutual inductance measurements unambiguously confirm the
gating is a uniform bulk effect. Close to Tc, the normal-state resistivity
shows a linear dependence on temperature and the linearity extends to lower
temperatures with the superconductivity suppressed by high magnetic fields. At
high fields, the normal-state magnetoresistance exhibits a linear-in-field
dependence and obeys a simple scaling relation between applied field and
temperature. Consistent behaviors are observed for different-Tc states
throughout the gating process, suggesting the pairing mechanism very likely
remains the same from low- to high-Tc state. Importantly, the coefficient of
the linear-in-temperature resistivity is positively correlated with Tc,
similarly to the observations in cuprates, Bechgaard salts and iron pnictide
superconductors. Our study points to a short-range antiferromagnetic exchange

gapless surface states of topological Dirac semimetal (TDSM). Low-dissipation
spin current is a building block of next-generation spintronics devices. While
conduction electrons in metals and spin waves in ferromagnetic insulators
(FMIs) are the major carriers of spin current, their propagation length is
inevitably limited due to the Joule heating or the Gilbert damping. In order to
suppress dissipation and realize long-range spin transport, we here make use of
the spin-helical surface states of TDSMs, such as $\mathrm{Cd_3 As_2}$ and
$\mathrm{Na_3 Bi}$, which are robust against disorder. Based on a junction of
two FMIs connected by a TDSM, we demonstrate that the magnetization dynamics in
one FMI induces a spin current on the TDSM surface flowing to the other FMI. By
both the analytical transport theory on the surface and the numerical
simulation of real-time evolution in the bulk, we find that the induced spin
current takes a universal semi-quantized value that is insensitive to the
microscopic coupling structure between the FMI and the TDSM. We show that this
surface spin current is robust against disorder over a long range, which
indicates that the TDSM surface serves as a promising system for realizing
spintronics devices.

from an interplay between proximity-induced strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI)
and the layer polarizability in BLG. The low-energy carriers in the BLG
experience an effective valley Zeeman SOI that is completely gate tunable to
the extent that it can be switched on or off by applying a transverse
displacement field or can be controllably transferred between the valence and
the conduction band. We demonstrate that this results in the evolution from
weak localization to weak antilocalization at a constant electronic density as
the net displacement field is tuned from a positive to a negative value with a
concomitant SOI-induced splitting of the low-energy bands of the BLG near the K
(K') valley, which is a unique signature of the theoretically predicted
spin-orbit valve effect. Our analysis shows that quantum correction to the
Drude conductance in Dirac materials with strong induced SOI can only be
explained satisfactorily by a theory that accounts for the SOI-induced spin

can vary by nearly three orders of magnitude between different filaments within
a cloud due to different levels of CR penetration. The CR ionization rate among
these filaments is similar. The equilibrium temperature that could be

Traditional age estimation mechanism focuses estimation age error, but ignores
that there is a deviation between the estimated age and real age due to

introduces age deviation to solve the above problem and improves classification
capability of the estimated age significantly. However,it does not consider the
age estimation error of the normal control (NC) group and results in a larger
error between the estimated age and real age of NC group. Therefore, an
integrated age estimation mechanism based on Decision-Level fusion of error and
deviation orientation model is proposed to solve the problem.Firstly, the
traditional age estimation and pathological age estimation mechanisms are
weighted together.Secondly, their optimal weights are obtained by minimizing
mean absolute error (MAE) between the estimated age and real age of normal
people. In the experimental section, several representative age-related
datasets are used for verification of the proposed method. The results show
that the proposed age estimation mechanism achieves a good tradeoff effect of
age estimation. It not only improves the classification ability of the
estimated age, but also reduces the age estimation error of the NC group. In
general, the proposed age estimation mechanism is effective. Additionally, the
mechanism is a framework mechanism that can be used to construct different

required to explain the late-time light curve. These features hint at the

examine the physical origins of rapidly evolving astrophysical transients like
SN 2018gep. We investigate the wave-driven mass-loss mechanism and how it
depends on model parameters such as progenitor mass and deposition energy,
searching for stellar progenitor models that can reproduce the observational
data. A model with an ejecta mass $\sim \! 2 \, M_{\odot}$, explosion energy
$\sim \! 10^{52}$ erg, a circumstellar medium of mass $\sim \! 0.3 \,

find both wave-driven mass-loss and mass ejection via pulsational
pair-instability can plausibly create the dense CSM in SN 2018gep, but we favor

projected onto 2D images for compressing with the existing video codecs.
However, the existing video codecs are originally designed for natural visual
signals, and it fails to account for the characteristics of point clouds. Thus,
there are still problems in the compression of geometry information generated
from the point clouds. Firstly, the distortion model in the existing
rate-distortion optimization (RDO) is not consistent with the geometry quality
assessment metrics. Secondly, the prediction methods in video codecs fail to
account for the fact that the highest depth values of a far layer is greater
than or equal to the corresponding lowest depth values of a near layer. This
paper proposes an advanced geometry surface coding (AGSC) method for dynamic
point clouds (DPC) compression. The proposed method consists of two modules,
including an error projection model-based (EPM-based) RDO and an occupancy
map-based (OM-based) merge prediction. Firstly, the EPM model is proposed to
describe the relationship between the distortion model in the existing video
codec and the geometry quality metric. Secondly, the EPM-based RDO method is
presented to project the existing distortion model on the plane normal and is
simplified to estimate the average normal vectors of coding units (CUs).
Finally, we propose the OM-based merge prediction approach, in which the
prediction pixels of merge modes are refined based on the occupancy map.
Experiments tested on the standard point clouds show that the proposed method
achieves an average 9.84\% bitrate saving for geometry compression.

surfactant in stabilizing the growing films. Furthermore, we investigate
systematically the dependence of the topological properties of stanene on the

nontrivial topology is attributable to the strong spin-orbit coupling of the Bi

electronic hybridization between the 1$T$-TaS$_2$ and 1$H$-TaS$_2$ layers in

Fermi level, which suppresses the electronic correlation induced band

networks, and learning rules can be derived through optimization procedures on
such measures. In biological neural networks, computation is restricted by the
amount of available resources. Considering energy restrictions, it is thus
reasonable to balance information processing efficacy with energy consumption.
Here, we studied networks of non-linear Hawkes neurons and assessed the
information flow through these networks using mutual information. We then
applied gradient descent for a combination of mutual information and energetic
costs to obtain a learning rule. Through this procedure, we obtained a rule
containing a sliding threshold, similar to the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rule.
The rule contains terms local in time and in space plus one global variable
common to the whole network. The rule thus belongs to so-called three-factor
rules and the global variable could be related to a number of biological
processes. In neural networks using this learning rule, frequent inputs get
mapped onto low energy orbits of the network while rare inputs aren't learned.

has several challenging characteristics that general semantic segmentation does
not have. There are two critical issues: The one is an extremely
foreground-background imbalanced distribution, and the other is multiple small
objects along with the complex background. Such problems make the recent dense
affinity context modeling perform poorly even compared with baselines due to
over-introduced background context. To handle these problems, we propose a
point-wise affinity propagation module based on the Feature Pyramid Network
(FPN) framework, named PointFlow. Rather than dense affinity learning, a sparse
affinity map is generated upon selected points between the adjacent features,
which reduces the noise introduced by the background while keeping efficiency.
In particular, we design a dual point matcher to select points from the salient
area and object boundaries, respectively. Experimental results on three
different aerial segmentation datasets suggest that the proposed method is more
effective and efficient than state-of-the-art general semantic segmentation
methods. Especially, our methods achieve the best speed and accuracy trade-off
on three aerial benchmarks. Further experiments on three general semantic

the existing data in the literature, thus demonstrating the power of FAST in
revealing detailed structures of HI absorption lines. Our pilot observations
and tests have enabled us to develop a strategy to search for HI absorption
sources using the data from the FAST extragalactic HI survey, which is one of
the key projects undertaken at FAST. We expect that over 1,500 extragalactic HI
absorbing systems could be detected with survey data, based on sensitivity

corrupts the information content. This paper introduces an unsupervised medical
image denoising technique that learns noise characteristics from the available
images and constructs denoised images. It comprises of two blocks of data
processing, viz., patch-based dictionaries that indirectly learn the noise and
residual learning (RL) that directly learns the noise. The model is generalized
to account for both 2D and 3D images considering different medical imaging
instruments. The images are considered one-by-one from the stack of MRI/CT
images as well as the entire stack is considered, and decomposed into
overlapping image/volume patches. These patches are given to the patch-based
dictionary learning to learn noise characteristics via sparse representation
while given to the RL part to directly learn the noise properties. K-singular
value decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm for sparse representation is used for
training patch-based dictionaries. On the other hand, residue in the patches is
trained using the proposed deep residue network. Iterating on these two parts,
an optimum noise characterization for each image/volume patch is captured and
in turn it is subtracted from the available respective image/volume patch. The
obtained denoised image/volume patches are finally assembled to a denoised
image or 3D stack. We provide an analysis of the proposed approach with other
approaches. Experiments on MRI/CT datasets are run on a GPU-based supercomputer
and the comparative results show that the proposed algorithm preserves the
critical information in the images as well as improves the visual quality of
the images.

using molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly evaluated the binding
energetic features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to
find the key residues. Although the overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2
RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, the difference in binding
affinity is as large as -16.35 kcal/mol. Energy decomposition analyses
identified three binding patches in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues
(Phe486, Tyr505, Asn501, Tyr489, Gln493, Leu455 and etc) which are believed to
be the main targets for drug development. The dominating forces are from van

mention that we found seven mutational sites (Lys417, Leu455, Ala475, Gly476,
Glu484, Gln498 and Val503) on SARS-CoV-2 which unexpectedly weakened the
RBD-ACE2 binding. Very interestingly, the most repulsive residue at the
RBD-ACE2 interface (E484), is found to be mutated in the latest UK variant,
B1.1.7, cause complete virus neutralization escapes from highly neutralizing
COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Our present results indicate that at least from

energetic point of view, of the binding features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2

tag-conditioned convolutional neural network (CNN). The FBCRNN employs two
recurrent neural network (RNN) classifiers sharing the same CNN for
preprocessing. With one RNN processing a recording in forward direction and the
other in backward direction, the two networks are trained to jointly predict
audio tags, i.e., weak labels, at each time step within a recording, given that
at each time step they have jointly processed the whole recording. The proposed
training encourages the classifiers to tag events as soon as possible.
Therefore, after training, the networks can be applied to shorter audio
segments of, e.g., 200 ms, allowing sound event detection (SED). Further, we
propose a tag-conditioned CNN to complement SED. It is trained to predict
strong labels while using (predicted) tags, i.e., weak labels, as additional
input. For training pseudo strong labels from a FBCRNN ensemble are used. The

primordial universe. Here we present a new study on the effects that X-ray
sources have on the HeII ionization in the extremely metal-poor galaxy IZw18 (Z

binary (HMXB). This study uses optical integral field spectroscopy, archival
Hubble Space Telescope observations, and all of the X-ray data sets publicly
available for IZw18. We investigate the time-variability of the IZw18 HMXB for
the first time; its emission shows small variations on timescales from days to
decades. The best-fit models for the HMXB X-ray spectra cannot reproduce the
observed HeII ionization budget of IZw18, nor can recent photoionization models
that combine the spectra of both very low metallicity massive stars and the
emission from HMXB. We also find that the IZw18 HMXB and the HeII-emission peak
are spatially displaced at a projected distance of $\simeq$ 200 pc. These
results reduce the relevance of X-ray photons as the dominant HeII ionizing
mode in IZw18, which leaves uncertain what process is responsible for the bulk

left-handed circularly polarized light by chiral particles. Optical vortices
which convey orbital angular momentum (OAM) possess a chirality associated with
the clockwise or anti-clockwise twisting of their wavefront. Here it is
highlighted that both oriented and randomly oriented chiral particles absorb
photons from twisted beams at different rates depending on whether the vortex
twists to the right or the left through a dipole coupling scheme. This is in
contrast to previous studies that investigated dipole couplings with vortex
modes in the paraxial approximation and showed no such chiral sensitivity to
the vortex handedness: only in oriented media where electric quadrupole
coupling contributes to optical activity effects due to absorption does such a
mechanism exist for paraxial vortices. The distinct difference in the scheme
highlighted in this work is that longitudinal fields are taken account of and
these allow for OAM transfer even during dipole interactions. Due to the vortex
dichroism persisting in randomly oriented collections of chiral particles, the
mechanism has a distinct advantage in its potential applicability in chemical
and biochemical applications where the systems under study are invariably in
the liquid phase. Additionally, the result is put into context in terms of the
quantifiable optical chirality, highlighting that optical OAM can in fact
increase the optical chirality density of an electromagnetic field.

manipulation, but still, the handling of non-rigid objects, such as cloth
garments, is an open problem. Physical interaction with non-rigid objects is
uncertain and complex to model. Thus, extracting useful information from sample
data can considerably improve modeling performance. However, the training of
such models is a challenging task due to the high-dimensionality of the state
representation. In this paper, we propose Controlled Gaussian Process Dynamical
Model (CGPDM) for learning high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics by embedding it
in a low-dimensional manifold. A CGPDM is constituted by a low-dimensional
latent space, with an associated dynamics where external control variables can
act and a mapping to the observation space. The parameters of both maps are
marginalized out by considering Gaussian Process (GP) priors. Hence, a CGPDM
projects a high-dimensional state space into a smaller dimension latent space,
in which it is feasible to learn the system dynamics from training data. The
modeling capacity of CGPDM has been tested in both a simulated and a real
scenario, where it proved to be capable of generalizing over a wide range of
movements and confidently predicting the cloth motions obtained by previously
unseen sequences of control actions.

constraints to limit frequency's nadir and rate of change during scheduling.
This can result in significant curtailment of renewable energy due to the
minimum generation of thermal plants that are needed to provide frequency
response (FR) and inertia. Additional consideration of fast FR, a dynamically
reduced largest loss and under frequency load shedding (UFLS) allows frequency
security to be achieved more cost effectively. This paper derives a novel nadir
constraint from the swing equation that, for the first time, provides a
framework for the optimal comparison of all these services. We demonstrate that
this constraint can be accurately and conservatively approximated for moderate
UFLS levels with a second order cone, resulting in highly tractable convex
problems. Case studies performed on a Great Britain 2030 system demonstrate
that UFLS as an option to contain single plant outages can reduce annual
operational costs by up to {\pounds}559m, 52% of frequency security costs. The
sensitivity of this value to wind penetration, abundance of alternative
frequency services, UFLS amount and cost is explored.

multiple access (NOMA)-enhanced Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, where a
mobile unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is exploited as a flying base station to
collect data from ground devices via the NOMA protocol. With the aim of
maximizing network energy efficiency, we formulate a joint problem of UAV
deployment, device scheduling and resource allocation. First, we formulate the
joint device scheduling and spectrum allocation problem as a three-sided
matching problem, and propose a novel low-complexity near-optimal algorithm. We
also introduce the novel concept of `exploration' into the matching game for
further performance improvement. By algorithm analysis, we prove the
convergence and stability of the final matching state. Second, in an effort to
allocate proper transmit power to IoT devices, we adopt the Dinkelbach's
algorithm to obtain the optimal power allocation solution. Furthermore, we
provide a simple but effective approach based on disk covering problem to
determine the optimal number and locations of UAV's stop points to ensure that
all IoT devices can be fully covered by the UAV via line-of-sight (LoS) links
for the sake of better channel condition. Numerical results unveil that: i) the
proposed joint UAV deployment, device scheduling and resource allocation scheme
achieves much higher EE compared to predefined stationary UAV deployment case
and fixed power allocation scheme, with acceptable complexity; and ii) the
UAV-aided IoT networks with NOMA greatly outperforms the OMA case in terms of
number of accessed devices.

This work provides an analysis of how the galaxy number density of the
input data affects the filaments detected with the Bisous filament finder and
gives estimates of the reliability of the method itself to assess the
robustness of the results.
  Methods. We applied the Bisous filament finder to MultiDark-Galaxies data,
using various magnitude cuts from the catalogue to study the effects of
different galaxy number densities on the results and different parameters of
the model. We compared the structures by the fraction of galaxies in filaments
and the volume filled by filaments, and we analysed the similarities between
the results from different cuts based on the overlap between detected
filamentary structures. The filament finder was also applied to the exact same
data 200 times with the same parameters to study the stochasticity of the
results and the correlation between different runs was calculated.
  Results. Multiple samples show that galaxies in filaments have preferentially
higher luminosity. We found that when a galaxy is in a filament there is a 97%
chance that the same galaxy would be in a filament with even more complete
input data and about 85% of filaments are persistent when detecting the
filamentary network with higher-density input data. Lower galaxy number density
inputs mean the Bisous model finds fewer filaments, but the filaments found are
persistent even if we use more complete input data for the detection. We
calculated the correlation coefficient between 200 Bisous runs on the exact
same input, which is 0.98.
  Conclusions. This study confirms that increased number density of galaxies is
important to obtain a more complete picture of the cosmic web. To overcome the
limitation of the spectroscopic surveys, we will develop the Bisous model
further to apply this tool to combined spectroscopic and narrow-band
photometric redshift surveys, such as the J-PAS.

Contrary to the western music notation, the pitch of each note is encrypted and

in the cycle structure. We first define and determine the node elements of each

music into a graph and define the distance between the nodes as their adjacent
occurrence rate. The graph is used as a point cloud whose homological structure
is investigated by measuring the hole structure in each dimension. We identify
cycles of each music, match those in Jeongganbo, and show how those cycles are

Suyeonjang and Songuyeo, categorized as a special type of cyclic music known as
Dodeuri, frequently overlap each other when appearing in the music while the
cycles found in Taryong, which does not belong to Dodeuri class, appear
individually.

safe practises among users to maintain computer system's health and online
security have become imperative, and this is known as cyber-hygiene. Poor
cyber-hygiene among internet users is a very critical issue undermining the
general acceptance and adoption of internet technology. It has become a global
issue and concern in this digital era when virtually all business transactions,
learning, communication and many other activities are performed online. Virus
attack, poor authentication technique, improper file backups and the use of
different social engineering approaches by cyber-attackers to deceive internet
users into divulging their confidential information with the intention to
attack them have serious negative implications on the industries and
organisations, including educational institutions. Moreover, risks associated
with these ugly phenomena are likely to be more in developing countries such as
Nigeria. Thus, authors of this paper undertook an online pilot study among
students and employees of University of Nigeria, Nsukka and a total of 145
responses were received and used for the study. The survey seeks to find out
the effect of age and level of education on the cyber hygiene knowledge and
behaviour of the respondents, and in addition, the type of devices used and
activities they engage in while on the internet. Our findings show wide
adoption of internet in institution of higher learning, whereas, significant
number of the internet users do not have good cyber hygiene knowledge and
behaviour. Hence, our findings can instigate an organised training for students
and employees of higher institutions in Nigeria.

very efficient and can significantly accelerate branch-and-bound (BaB) based
complete verification of neural networks. However, bound propagation cannot
fully handle the neuron split constraints introduced by BaB commonly handled by
expensive linear programming (LP) solvers, leading to loose bounds and hurting
verification efficiency. In this work, we develop $\beta$-CROWN, a new bound
propagation based method that can fully encode neuron splits via optimizable
parameters $\beta$ constructed from either primal or dual space. When jointly
optimized in intermediate layers, $\beta$-CROWN generally produces better
bounds than typical LP verifiers with neuron split constraints, while being as
efficient and parallelizable as CROWN on GPUs. Applied to complete robustness
verification benchmarks, $\beta$-CROWN with BaB is up to three orders of
magnitude faster than LP-based BaB methods, and is notably faster than all
existing approaches while producing lower timeout rates. By terminating BaB
early, our method can also be used for efficient incomplete verification. We
consistently achieve higher verified accuracy in many settings compared to
powerful incomplete verifiers, including those based on convex barrier breaking
techniques. Compared to the typically tightest but very costly semidefinite

Furthermore, training these CNNs is computationally complex and involves costly

it to train a siamese CNN. Furthermore, we present three techniques for
automatic annotation of image pairs with labels indicating their degree of

freedom is altered by the presence of a generic perturbation is a notoriously
difficult question. Recent works predict that, in the overwhelming majority of
cases, the unperturbed dynamics is just damped by a simple function, e.g.,
exponentially as expected from Fermi's golden rule. While these predictions
rely on random-matrix arguments and typicality, they can only be verified for a
specific physical situation by comparing to the actual solution or measurement.
Crucially, it also remains unclear how frequent and under which conditions
counterexamples to the typical behavior occur. In this work, we discuss this
question from the perspective of projection-operator techniques, where
exponential damping of a density matrix occurs in the interaction picture but
not necessarily in the Schr\""odinger picture. We show that a nontrivial damping
in the Schr\""odinger picture can emerge if the dynamics in the unperturbed
system possesses rich features, for instance due to the presence of strong
interactions. This suggestion has consequences for the time dependence of
correlation functions. We substantiate our theoretical arguments by large-scale
numerical simulations of charge transport in the extended Fermi-Hubbard chain,
where the nearest-neighbor interactions are treated as a perturbation to the
integrable reference system.

surface drag. This coupling is however usually represented through a roughness
length. Originally suggested on purely dimensional grounds, this roughness
length does not directly correspond to a measurable physical quantity of the
wind-and-wave system. Here, to go beyond this representation, we formalize
ideas underlying the Beaufort scale by quantifying the velocity of breaking
short waves that are the most coupled to near-surface wind. This velocity
increases with wind speed, reflecting the fact that stronger winds can be
visually identified by longer (and faster) breakers becoming predominant on the
sea surface. A phenomenological turbulence model further shows that this
velocity is associated with breaking waves that impede the most the formation
of turbulent eddies. Scales of such eddies are then constrained inside a
so-called roughness sub-layer. Unlike previous theoretical developments, the
proposed breaker velocity is a directly measurable quantity, which could be
used to characterize the coupling between wind and waves using remote sensing
techniques. This work provides a physical framework for new formulations of
air-sea momentum exchange in which the effects of surface currents and slicks
on surface drag can also be incorporated. Finally, it provides a long-sought
physical explanation for the Beaufort scale: a universal link between wave
breaking, wind speed and surface drag.

When its entropy surface density is larger (smaller) than $1/4$, this type of

the black holes with $1/4$-entropy surface density are regarded as
Bekenstein-Hawking black holes. We compute the entropy surface density for four

transition. Quasi-2D square planar nickelates, Rn+1NinO2n+2 (R=rare earth, n=2,
3...), are of significant interest and long sought for cuprate analogue due to
the 3d9 electronic configuration of Ni+, the same as the active ion Cu2+ in the
high-Tc superconducting cuprates. The field has attracted intense attention
since 2019 due to the discovery of superconductivity in thin films of
Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2, although no superconductivity has been reported in bulk
polycrystalline powders. Herein, we review the synthesis of polycrystalline
powders of quasi-2D square planar nickelates through topotactic reduction of
parent compounds that are synthesized via solid state reaction, precursor
method, high pressure floating zone method and high-pressure flux method. We
emphasize single crystal preparation using the high-pressure floating zone
techniques. We discuss their crystal structure and physical properties
including resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity. We highlight
the cuprate-like physics, including charge/spin stripes and large orbital
polarization, identified in single crystals of R4Ni3O8 (R=La and Pr) combining
synchrotron X-ray/neutron single crystal diffraction and density functional
theory calculations. Furthermore, the challenges and possible research
directions of this fast-moving field in the future are briefly discussed.

ladders with suitable operation points for all users and typically involves
multiple resolutions. While open GOP coding structures are generally known to
provide substantial coding efficiency benefit, their use in HTTP streaming has
been precluded through lacking support of reference picture resampling (RPR) in
AVC and HEVC. The newly emerging Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard supports
RPR, but only conversational scenarios were primarily investigated during the
design of VVC. This paper aims at enabling usage of RPR in HTTP streaming
scenarios through analysing the drift potential of VVC coding tools and
presenting a constrained encoding method that avoids severe drift artefacts in
resolution switching with open GOP coding in VVC. In typical live streaming
configurations, the presented method achieves -8.57% BD-rate reduction compared
to closed GOP coding while in a typical Video on Demand configuration, -1.89%
BD-rate reduction is reported. The constraints penalty compared to regular open
GOP coding is 0.65% BD-rate in the worst case. The presented method was
integrated into the publicly available open source VVC encoder VVenC v0.3.

based multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) communication link (MG-MIMO)
experimentally in a line-of-sight (LoS) scenario. A compact multi-mode PSOAM
antenna is demonstrated experimentally to generate multiple independent
controllable PSOAM waves, which can be used for constructing MGs. After several
proof-of-principle tests, it has been verified that the beam directionality
gain of MG can improve the receiving signal-to-noise (SNR) level in an actual
system, meanwhile, the vorticity can provide another degree of freedom (DoF) to
reduce the spatial correlation of MIMO system. Furthermore, a tentative
long-distance transmission experiment operated at 10.2 GHz has been performed
successfully at a distance of 50 m with a single-way spectrum efficiency of 3.7

not contain prime nodes, i.e., the symbolic ultrametrics, can be exaplained in

every symmetric map can be explained by ""extended"" hypercubes and half-grids.
We then derive a a linear-time algorithm that stepwisely resolves prime

spectral line profiles of CH$_3$OH during each ACA execution. The variations in
CH$_3$OH outgassing are consistent with Wirtanen's 9 hr nucleus rotational

and engineering, where first-principle-based, well-resolved simulations are
often prohibitively expensive. For example, in fluid dynamics, constitutive
models are required to describe nonlocal, unresolved physics such as turbulence
and laminar-turbulent transition. However, traditional constitutive models
based on partial differential equations (PDEs) often lack robustness and are
too rigid to accommodate diverse calibration datasets. We propose a
frame-independent, nonlocal constitutive model based on a vector-cloud neural
network that can be learned with data. The model predicts the closure variable
at a point based on the flow information in its neighborhood. Such nonlocal
information is represented by a group of points, each having a feature vector
attached to it, and thus the input is referred to as vector cloud. The cloud is
mapped to the closure variable through a frame-independent neural network,
invariant both to coordinate translation and rotation and to the ordering of
points in the cloud. As such, the network can deal with any number of
arbitrarily arranged grid points and thus is suitable for unstructured meshes
in fluid simulations. The merits of the proposed network are demonstrated for
scalar transport PDEs on a family of parameterized periodic hill geometries.
The vector-cloud neural network is a promising tool not only as nonlocal
constitutive models and but also as general surrogate models for PDEs on
irregular domains.

cataloged stars, model the distributions of their periods, mass ratios,
temperatures and other quantities, and compare them with the data from CRTS,
LAMOST and Gaia archives. As only a small fraction of the sample has radial
velocity curves, we examine the reliability of the photometric mass ratios in
totally and partially eclipsing systems and find that totally eclipsing W UMa
stars with photometric mass ratios have the same parameter distributions as
those with spectroscopic mass ratios. Most of the stars with reliable
parameters have mass ratios below 0.5 and orbital periods shorter than 0.5
days. Stars with longer periods and temperatures above 7000 K stand out as
outliers and shouldn't be labeled as W UMa binaries.

gains, modeling the influence of the subsystems on each other, are linear
functions. Moreover, the gain operator built from the internal gains is assumed
to be subadditive and homogeneous, which covers both max-type and sum-type
formulations for the ISS Lyapunov functions of the subsystems. As a
consequence, the small-gain condition can be formulated in terms of a
generalized spectral radius of the gain operator. Through an example, we show
that the small-gain condition can easily be checked if the interconnection

provides an ISS Lyapunov function in implication form for the overall network,
an ISS Lyapunov function in a dissipative form is constructed under mild extra

Italian firms' discussion on Twitter in the first nine months of the pandemic.
We downloaded all Twitter posts from 1st of March, 2020, to 17th of November,
2020 by the accounts of the largest Italian firms, i.e. those with 250 or more
employees. We then built the bipartite network of accounts and hashtags and,
using an entropy-based null model as a benchmark, we projected the information
contained in the network into the accounts layers, identifying a network of
accounts in which a link indicates a non trivial similarity in terms of their
usage of hashtags. We find that the conversation is focused around 13
communities, 10 of which include Covid-19 themes. The core of the network is
formed of 5 communities, which deal with environmental sustainability, digital
innovation and safety. Firms' ownership type does not seem to influence the
conversation. 10 communities out of 13 mention hashtags related to CSR, with
the environmental and social dimensions as the prevalent ones. Interestingly
enough, the social dimension seems more relevant in the communities dealing
with digital innovation and safety. However, the relevance of CSR hashtags is
very small at the single message level, but with some peculiarities arising in
specific communities. Overall, our paper highlights the role of network methods
on Twitter data as a tool which can support managers and policy makers to
design their strategies and decision making, capturing firms' emerging issues

most quickly execute a given permutation on the tokens? In (sequential) token
swapping, the goal is to use the shortest possible sequence of swaps, each of
which exchanges the tokens at the two endpoints of an edge of the graph. In
parallel token swapping, the goal is to use the fewest rounds, each of which
consists of one or more swaps on the edges of a matching. We prove that both of
these problems remain NP-hard when the graph is restricted to be a tree.
  These token swapping problems have been studied by disparate groups of
researchers in discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, robot motion
planning, game theory, and engineering. Previous work establishes
NP-completeness on general graphs (for both problems); polynomial-time
algorithms for simple graph classes such as cliques, stars, paths, and cycles;
and constant-factor approximation algorithms in some cases. The two natural
cases of sequential and parallel token swapping in trees were first studied
over thirty years ago (as ""sorting with a transposition tree"") and over
twenty-five years ago (as ""routing permutations via matchings""), yet their
complexities were previously unknown.
  We also show limitations on approximation of sequential token swapping on
trees: we identify a broad class of algorithms that encompass all three known
polynomial-time algorithms that achieve the best known approximation factor
(which is $2$) and show that no such algorithm can achieve an approximation
factor less than $2$.

VAns (Variable Ansatz), applies a set of rules to both grow and (crucially)
remove quantum gates in an informed manner during the optimization.
Consequently, VAns is ideally suited to mitigate trainability and noise-related
issues by keeping the ansatz shallow. We employ VAns in the variational quantum
eigensolver for condensed matter and quantum chemistry applications, in the
quantum autoencoder for data compression and in unitary compilation problems
showing successful results in all cases.

  PART 1. The following bare-bones story introduces the idea of a cumulative
hierarchy of pure sets: 'Sets are arranged in stages. Every set is found at
some stage. At any stage S: for any sets found before S, we find a set whose
members are exactly those sets. We find nothing else at S.' Surprisingly, this
story already guarantees that the sets are arranged in well-ordered levels, and
suffices for quasi-categoricity. I show this by presenting Level Theory, a
simplifiation of set theories due to Scott, Montague, Derrick, and Potter.
  PART 2. Potentialists think that the concept of set is importantly modal.
Using tensed language as an heuristic, the following bare-bones story
introduces the idea of a potential hierarchy of sets: 'Always: for any sets
that existed, there is a set whose members are exactly those sets; there are no
other sets.' Surprisingly, this story already guarantees well-foundedness and
persistence. Moreover, if we assume that time is linear, the ensuing modal set
theory is almost definitionally equivalent with non-modal set theories;
specifically, with Level Theory, as developed in Part 1.
  PART 3. On a very natural conception of sets, every set has an absolute
complement. The ordinary cumulative hierarchy dismisses this idea outright. But
we can rectify this, whilst retaining classical logic. Indeed, we can develop a
boolean algebra of sets arranged in well-ordered levels. I show this by
presenting Boolean Level Theory, which fuses ordinary Level Theory (from Part
1) with ideas due to Thomas Forster, Alonzo Church, and Urs Oswald. BLT neatly
implement Conway's games and surreal numbers; and a natural extension of BLT is
definitionally equivalent with ZF.

training confidence models, but the non-unique tokenization from word to WP
causes inaccurate labels to be generated. This paper proposes and studies two
confidence models of increasing complexity to solve this problem. The final
model uses self-attention to directly learn word-level confidence without
needing subword tokenization, and exploits full context features from multiple
hypotheses to improve confidence accuracy. Experiments on Voice Search and
long-tail test sets show standard metrics (e.g., NCE, AUC, RMSE) improving

Unfortunately, performing exact inference is intractable in general. One
alternative is variational inference, where a candidate probability
distribution is optimized to approximate the posterior distribution over
unobserved variables. For good approximations, a flexible and highly expressive
candidate distribution is desirable. In this work, we use quantum Born machines
as variational distributions over discrete variables. We apply the framework of
operator variational inference to achieve this goal. In particular, we adopt
two specific realizations: one with an adversarial objective and one based on
the kernelized Stein discrepancy. We demonstrate the approach numerically using
examples of Bayesian networks, and implement an experiment on an IBM quantum
computer. Our techniques enable efficient variational inference with
distributions beyond those that are efficiently representable on a classical

Superconducting detectors promise an intrinsic resolving power at visible

study superconducting energy-resolving Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors
(MKIDs), which hold particular promise for larger cameras. A
visible/near-infrared photon absorbed in the superconductor creates a few
thousand quasiparticles through several stages of electron-phonon interaction.
Here we demonstrate experimentally that the resolving power of MKIDs at visible

function of photon energy using four lasers with wavelengths between $1545-402$
nm. For detectors on thick SiN/Si and sapphire substrates the resolving power
is limited to $10-21$ for the respective wavelengths, consistent with the loss
of hot phonons. When we suspend the sensitive part of the detector on a 110 nm
thick SiN membrane, the measured resolving power improves to $19-52$

phase space, meaning that there are no sudden qualitative changes in the
character of the orbital motion during the inspiral. However, in this chapter
we discuss the cases where this assumption fails and non-linear and/or

perturbation, topological transitions suddenly appear at resonances, and we
sketch how to implement the passage through such regions in an inspiral model.
Even though many of the developments of this chapter apply to general
inspirals, we focus on a particular scenario known as the Extreme mass ratio
inspiral (EMRI). An EMRI consists of a compact stellar-mass object inspiralling
into a supermassive black hole. At leading order, the referential conservative
system is simply geodesic motion in the field of the supermassive black hole
and the rate of the drift is given by radiation reaction. In Einstein gravity
the supermassive black hole field is the Kerr space-time in which the geodesic
motion is integrable. However, the equations of motion can be perturbed in
various ways so that prolonged resonances and chaos appear in phase space as
well as the inspiral, which we demonstrate in simple physically motivated

treatment of colorectal cancer. Since polyps vary in their shape, size, color,
and texture, accurate polyp segmentation is very challenging. One promising way
to mitigate the diversity of polyps is to model the contextual relation for
each pixel such as using attention mechanism. However, previous methods only
focus on learning the dependencies between the position within an individual
image and ignore the contextual relation across different images. In this
paper, we propose Duplex Contextual Relation Network (DCRNet) to capture both
within-image and cross-image contextual relations. Specifically, we first
design Interior Contextual-Relation Module to estimate the similarity between
each position and all the positions within the same image. Then Exterior
Contextual-Relation Module is incorporated to estimate the similarity between
each position and the positions across different images. Based on the above two
types of similarity, the feature at one position can be further enhanced by the
contextual region embedding within and across images. To store the
characteristic region embedding from all the images, a memory bank is designed
and operates as a queue. Therefore, the proposed method can relate similar
features even though they come from different images. We evaluate the proposed
method on the EndoScene, Kvasir-SEG and the recently released large-scale
PICCOLO dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed DCRNet outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the widely-used evaluation metrics.

general relativity with quantum mechanics and quantum field theory has
challenged for many decades this basic idea. We recently showed the emergence
of classical dynamics for very general quantum lattice systems with mean-field
interactions, without (complete) supression of its quantum features, in the
infinite volume limit. This leads to a theoretical framework in which the
classical and quantum worlds are entangled. Such an entanglement is noteworthy
and is a consequence of the highly non-local character of mean-field
interactions. Therefore, this phenomenon should not be restricted to systems
with mean-field interactions only, but should also appear in presence of
interactions that are sufficiently long-range, yielding effective, classical
background fields, in the spirit of the Higgs mechanism of quantum field
theory. In order to present the result in a less abstract way than in its

a major challenge. Martian geology is characterized by past evidence for
episodic surface liquid water, and geochemistry indicating a slow and
intermittent transition from wetter to drier and more oxidizing surface
conditions. Here we present a new model incorporating randomized injection of
reducing greenhouse gases and oxidation due to hydrogen escape, to investigate
the conditions responsible for these diverse observations. We find that Mars
could have transitioned repeatedly from reducing (H2-rich) to oxidizing
(O2-rich) atmospheric conditions in its early history. Our model predicts a
generally cold early Mars, with mean annual temperatures below 240 K. If peak
reducing gas release rates and background CO2 levels are high enough, it
nonetheless exhibits episodic warm intervals sufficient to degrade crater
walls, form valley networks and create other fluvial/lacustrine features. Our
model also predicts transient buildup of atmospheric O2, which can help explain
the occurrence of oxidized mineral species such as manganese oxides at Gale
Crater. We suggest that the apparent Noachian--Hesperian transition from
phyllosilicate deposition to sulfate deposition around 3.5 billion years ago
can be explained as a combined outcome of increasing planetary oxidation,
decreasing groundwater availability and a waning bolide impactor flux, which
dramatically slowed the remobilization and thermochemical destruction of
surface sulfates. Ultimately, rapid and repeated variations in Mars' early
climate and surface chemistry would have presented both challenges and
opportunities for any emergent microbial life.

(FEMs) have been a topic of renewed interest; this has largely been driven by
(a) the ability of finite element methods to better model geometry, (b) better
understanding of function spaces that are necessary to represent all Maxwell
quantities, and (c) more recently, the fundamental rubrics that should be
obeyed in space and time so as to satisfy Gauss' laws and the equation of
continuity. In that vein, methods have been developed recently that satisfy
these equations and are agnostic to time stepping methods. While is development
is indeed a significant advance, it should be noted that implicit FEM transient
solvers support an underlying null space that corresponds to a gradient of a
scalar potential $\nabla \Phi(\textbf{r})$ (or $t \nabla \Phi (\textbf{r})$ in
the case of wave equation solvers). While explicit schemes do not suffer from
this drawback, they are only conditionally stable, time step sizes are mesh
dependent, and very small. A way to overcome this bottleneck, and indeed,
satisfy all four Maxwell's equation is to use a quasi-Helmholtz formulation on
a tessellation. In the re-formulation presented, we strictly satisfy the
equation of continuity and Gauss' laws for both the electric and magnetic flux
densities. Results demonstrating the efficacy of this scheme will be presented.

to drink water at high frequencies. Such a fast moving tongue creates a liquid
column out of a bath which is bitten by the mouth for drinking. Presumably, the
animals bite just before the pinch-off time of the water column to maximize the
water intake. Otherwise, the water column falls back to the bath before being
bitten. Such a pinch-off phenomenon in the liquid column can be described as
the acceleration-induced (i.e., unsteady) inertia balances with the capillary
force. The classical Rayleigh-Plateau instability explains the competition of
the steady inertia with the capillarity, but not with the unsteady inertia. In
this study, we modify the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in the presence of the
fluid acceleration, and show that the most unstable wavenumber and growth rate
increase with acceleration. The pinch-off time is theoretically predicted as
the -1/3 power of the Bond number (i.e, a ratio of the acceleration-induced
inertia to capillarity). Finally, measured pinch-off times from previous
physical experiments and dog \& cat jaw-closing times are shown to be in good
agreement with our theoretical pinch-off time. Therefore, our study shows that
animals presumably modulate their lapping and jaw-closing time to bite down the
water column before the pinch-off to maximize the water intake.

C-ARIMA to assess the causal effect of a permanent price reduction on

emitter-plasmonic nanocavity system has the potential to bring these devices to
the microchip scale at ambient conditions. However, efficiently and precisely
positioning a single or a few emitters into a plasmonic nanocavity is
challenging. In addition, placing a strong coupling unit on a designated
substrate location is a demanding task. Here, fluorophore-modified DNA strands
are utilized to drive the formation of particle-on-film plasmonic nanocavities
and simultaneously integrate the fluorophores into the high field region of the
nanocavities. High cavity yield and fluorophore coupling yield are
demonstrated. This method is then combined with e-beam lithography to position
the strong coupling units on designated locations of a substrate. Furthermore,
the high correlation between electronic transition of the fluorophore and the
cavity resonance is observed, implying more vibrational modes may be involved.
Our system makes strong coupling units more practical on the microchip scale

fluorophore-plasmonic nanocavity interaction.

thermal bath, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that forming
collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the C=O asymmetric stretch
of CO2 molecules and a cavity mode accelerates hot-molecule relaxation. The
physical mechanism underlying this acceleration is the fact that polaritons,
especially the lower polariton, can be transiently excited during the
nonequilibrium process, which facilitates intermolecular vibrational energy
transfer. The VSC effects on these rates (i) resonantly depend on the cavity
mode detuning, (ii) cooperatively depend on molecular concentration or Rabi
splitting, and (iii) collectively scale with the number of hot molecules, which
is similar to Dicke's superradiance. For larger cavity volumes, due to a
balance between this superradiant-like behavior and a smaller light-matter
coupling, the total VSC effect on relaxation rates can scale slower than $1/N$,
and the average VSC effect per molecule can remain meaningful for up to $N
\sim10^4$ molecules forming VSC. Moreover, we find that the transiently excited
lower polariton prefers to relax by transferring its energy to the tail of the
molecular energy distribution rather than equally distributing it to all
thermal molecules. Finally, we highlight the similarities of parameter
dependence between the current finding with VSC catalysis observed in
Fabry-Perot microcavities.

rotating $f$-mode frequencies of rotating neutron stars with their stellar

state has been presented recently and they are here used as input for a
Bayesian analysis of the inverse problem. This allows to quantitatively
reconstruct basic neutron star parameters, such as the mass, radius, rotation
rate or universal scaling parameters. We find that future observations of both
$f$-mode frequencies, in combination with a Bayesian analysis, would provide a
promising direction to solve the inverse stellar problem. We provide two
complementary approaches, one that is equation of state dependent and one that
only uses universal scaling relations. We discuss advantages and disadvantages
of each approach, such as possible bias and robustness. The focus is on
astrophysically motivated scenarios in which informed prior information on the
neutron star mass or rotation rate can be provided and study how they impact
the results.

Electroencephalography (EEG) based authentication has shown promise in
overcoming these limitations. However, EEG-based authentication is less
accurate due to signal variability at different psychological and physiological
conditions. On the other hand, keystroke dynamics-based identification offers
high accuracy but suffers from different spoofing attacks. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel multimodal biometric system combining EEG and
keystroke dynamics. Firstly, a dataset was created by acquiring both keystroke
dynamics and EEG signals from 10 users with 500 trials per user at 10 different
sessions. Different statistical, time, and frequency domain features were
extracted and ranked from the EEG signals and key features were extracted from
the keystroke dynamics. Different classifiers were trained, validated, and
tested for both individual and combined modalities for two different
classification strategies - personalized and generalized. Results show that
very high accuracy can be achieved both in generalized and personalized cases
for the combination of EEG and keystroke dynamics. The identification and
authentication accuracies were found to be 99.80% and 99.68% for Extreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest classifiers, respectively which
outperform the individual modalities with a significant margin (around 5
percent). We also developed a binary template matching-based algorithm, which
gives 93.64% accuracy 6X faster. The proposed method is secured and reliable
for any kind of biometric authentication.

methodology - called Enhanced Parameter Estimation (EPE) - is proposed that
allows physically relevant parameter estimation rather than a blind force-fit
to energy use data. It calibrates a rapidly and inexpensively created
simulation model of the building in two stages: (a) building shell calibration
with the HVAC system is replaced by an by an ideal system that meets the loads.
EPE identifies a small number of high-level heat flows in the energy balance,
calculates them with specifically tailored individual driving functions,
introduces physically significant parameters to best accomplish energy balance,
and, estimates the parameters and their uncertainty bounds. Calibration is thus
done with corrective heat flows without any arbitrary tuning of input
parameters, (b) HVAC system calibration with the building shell replaced by a
box with only process loads; as many parameters as the data allows are
estimated. Calibration accuracy is enhanced by machine learning of the residual
errors. The EPE methodology is demonstrated through: a synthetic building and
one an actual 75,000 Sq.Ft. building in Pennsylvania. A subsequent paper will
provide further details and applications.

Optimizing the control plans when severe incidents occur still remains an open
problem, especially when a high number of lanes or entire intersections are

  This paper aims at tackling this problem and presents a novel methodology for
optimizing the traffic signal timings in signalized urban intersections, under
non-recurrent traffic incidents. With the purpose of producing fast and
reliable decisions, we combine the fast running Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms and the reliable Genetic Algorithms (GA) into a single optimization
framework. As a benchmark, we first start with deploying a typical GA algorithm
by considering the phase duration as the decision variable and the objective
function to minimize the total travel time in the network. We fine tune the GA
for crossover, mutation, fitness calculation and obtain the optimal parameters.
Secondly, we train various machine learning regression models to predict the
total travel time of the studied traffic network, and select the best
performing regressor which we further hyper-tune to find the optimal training
parameters. Lastly, we propose a new algorithm BGA-ML combining the GA
algorithm and the extreme-gradient decision-tree, which is the best performing
regressor, together in a single optimization framework. Comparison and results
show that the new BGA-ML is much faster than the original GA algorithm and can
be successfully applied under non-recurrent incident conditions.

them hard to apply to mobile network data due to their highly tuned nature and
related assumptions about the data. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm,
DANCE (Decorrelating Adversarial Nets for Clustering-friendly Encoding),
intended to be a reliable deep clustering method which also performs well when
applied to network automation use-cases. DANCE uses a reconstructive clustering
approach, separating clustering-relevant from clustering-irrelevant features in
a latent representation. This separation removes unnecessary information from
the clustering, increasing consistency and peak performance. We comprehensively
evaluate DANCE and other select state-of-the-art deep clustering algorithms,
and show that DANCE outperforms these algorithms by a significant margin on a
mobile network dataset.

  quantification of fatigue failure under stochastic loading using artificial
  neural networks and Gaussian process regression",,,,,"cs.LG physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Various engineering systems such as naval and aerial vehicles, offshore
structures, and mechanical components of motorized systems, are exposed to
fatigue failures due to stochastic loadings. Methods for early failure
prediction are essential for engineering, military, and civil applications. In
addition to the prediction of time to failure (TtF), uncertainty quantification
(UQ) is of major importance for real-time decision-making purposes. Usually,
time domain or frequency domain methods are used for fatigue prediction, such
as rainflow counting and Miner's rule or Dirlik's method. However, those
methods suffer from over-simplistic modeling and inaccurate failure predictions
under stochastic loadings. During the last years, several data-driven models
were suggested for offline fatigue failure. However, most of them are not
capable of both accurate real-time fatigue prediction and UQ. In the current
work, a probabilistic data-driven model is introduced. A hybrid architecture of
a fully-connected artificial neural network (FC-ANN) and Gaussian process
regression (GPR) is proposed to ensure enhanced predictive abilities and
simultaneous UQ of the predicted TtF. The real-time prediction and UQ
performances of the suggested model are validated using both synthetic and
experimental data. This novel hybrid method is fully data-driven and extends
the forecasting capabilities of existing time-domain and machine learning-based
methods for fatigue prediction. It paves the way towards the development of a
preventive system that provides real-time safety and operational instructions
and insights for structural health monitoring (SHM) purposes, allowing
prevention of environmental damage, and loss of human lives.

a challenge to identify the individuals at risk of dementia for precise
management. Brain MRI offers a noninvasive biomarker to detect brain aging.
Previous evidence shows that the brain structural change detected by diffusion
MRI is associated with dementia. Mounting studies has conceptualised the brain
as a complex network, which has shown the utility of this approach in
characterising various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, the
structural connectivity shows promise in dementia classification. The proposed
BrainNetGAN is a generative adversarial network variant to augment the brain
structural connectivity matrices for binary dementia classification tasks.
Structural connectivity matrices between separated brain regions are
constructed using tractography on diffusion MRI data. The BrainNetGAN model is
trained to generate fake brain connectivity matrices, which are expected to
reflect latent distribution of the real brain network data. Finally, a
convolutional neural network classifier is proposed for binary dementia
classification. Numerical results show that the binary classification
performance in the testing set was improved using the BrainNetGAN augmented
dataset. The proposed methodology allows quick synthesis of an arbitrary number
of augmented connectivity matrices and can be easily transferred to similar
classification tasks.

  COVID-19? A spatiotemporal analysis using open big data",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The growing popularity of e-scooters and their rapid expansion across urban
streets has attracted widespread attention. A major policy question is whether
e-scooters substitute existing mobility options or fill the service gaps left
by them. This study addresses this question by analyzing the spatiotemporal
patterns of e-scooter service availability and use in Washington DC, focusing
on their spatial relationships with public transit and bikesharing. Results
from an analysis of three open big datasets suggest that e-scooters have both
competing and complementary effects on transit and bikesharing services. The
supply of e-scooters significantly overlaps with the service areas of transit
and bikesharing, and we classify a majority of e-scooter trips as substitutes
to transit and bikesharing uses. A travel-time-based analysis further reveals
that when choosing e-scooters over transit, travelers pay a price premium and
save some travel time. The price premium is greater during the COVID-19
pandemic but the associated travel-time savings are smaller. This implies that
public health considerations rather than time-cost tradeoffs are the main
driver for many to choose e-scooters over transit during COVID. In addition, we
find that e-scooters complement bikesharing and transit by providing services
to underserved neighborhoods. A sizeable proportion (about 10 percent) of
e-scooter trips are taken to connect with the rail services. Future research
may combine the big-data-based analysis presented here with traditional methods
to further shed light on the interactions between e-scooter services,
bikesharing, and public transit.

instabilities. We first analyze a general Fourier approach to the solution of
the addressed linear partial differential problem. This technique allows to
show how the vertical gradient of the backreaction is, in general, inverted
with respect to the background one. Instead, the fundamental harmonic solution
constitutes a specific exception for which the background and the perturbed
profiles are both decaying. Then, we study the linear partial differential
system from the point of view of a general variable separation method. The
obtained profile describes the crystalline behavior of the disk. Using a simple
rescaling, the governing equation is reduced to the second order differential
Whittaker equation. The zeros of the radial magnetic field are found by using
the solution written in terms Kummer functions. The possible implications of

developed within a consistent variational framework in the context of
finite-deformation kinematics. A novel coalescence dissipation introduces a new
coupling mechanism between plasticity and fracture by degrading the fracture
toughness as the equivalent plastic strain increases. The proposed model is
compared with a recent alternative where plasticity and fracture are strongly
coupled. Several representative numerical examples motivate specific modeling
choices. In particular, a linear crack geometric function provides an
""unperturbed"" ductile response prior to crack initiation, and Lorentz-type
degradation functions ensure that the critical fracture strength remains
independent of the phase-field regularization length. In addition, the response
of the model is demonstrated to converge with a vanishing phase-field
regularization length. The model is then applied to calibrate and simulate a
three-point bending experiment of an aluminum specimen with a complex geometry.
The effect of the proposed coalescence dissipation coupling on simulations of
the experiment is first investigated in a two-dimensional plane strain setting.
The calibrated model is then applied to a three-dimensional calculation, where
the calculated load-deflection curves and the crack trajectory show excellent
agreement with experimental observations. Finally, the model is applied to
simulate crack nucleation and growth in a specimen from a recent Sandia
Fracture Challenge.

discriminator tries to distinguish the ASR output from the real data. Since the
ASR model is pre-trained, we hypothesize that the ASR model output (soft

makes the task of the discriminator harder within our GAN framework, which in
turn improves the performance of the ASR model in the fine-tuning stage. Here,
the pre-trained ASR model is fine-tuned adversarially against the discriminator
using an additional adversarial loss. Experiments on full LibriSpeech dataset
