and give applications to usual pairs especially to a class of pairs that we
call stable log minimal models.
  Fixing the dimension and a DCC set controlling coefficients, we will show
that the set of volumes of all projective generalised lc pairs $(X,B+M)$ under
the given data, satisfies the DCC. Futhermore, we will show that in the klt
case, the set of such pairs with ample $K_X+B+M$ and fixed volume, forms a
bounded family.
  We prove a result about descent of nef divisors to bounded families. This is
the key to proving the above and various other results.
  We will then apply the above to study projective lc pairs $(X,B)$ with
abundant $K_X+B$ of arbitrary Kodaira dimension. In particular, we show that
the set of Iitaka volumes of such pairs satisfies DCC under some natural
boundedness assumptions on the fibres of the Iitaka fibration.
  We define stable log minimal models which consist of a projective lc pair
$(X,B)$ with semi-ample $K_X+B$ together with a divisor $A\ge 0$ so that
$K_X+B+A$ is ample and $A$ does not contain any non-klt centre of $(X,B)$. This
is a generalisation of both usual stable pairs of general type and stable log
Calabi-Yau pairs. Fixing appropriate invariants we show that stable log minimal
models form a bounded family. Then we discuss connection with moduli spaces.

predictive control of stochastic linear time-invariant systems. The distinction
between the two approaches lies in the fact that the indirect approach involves
identifying a lower dimensional model from data which is then used in a
certainty-equivalent control design, while the direct approach avoids this
intermediate step altogether. Working within an optimization-based framework,
we find that the suboptimality gap measuring the control performance w.r.t. the
optimal model-based control design vanishes with the size of the dataset only
with the direct approach. The indirect approach has a higher rate of
convergence, but its suboptimality gap does not vanish as the size of the
dataset increases. This reveals the existence of two distinct regimes of
performance as the size of the dataset of input-output behaviors is increased.
We show that the indirect approach, by relying on the identification of a lower
dimensional model, has lower variance and outperforms the direct approach for
smaller datasets, while it incurs an asymptotic bias as a result of the process
noise and a (possibly) incorrect assumption on the order of the identified
model. The direct approach, however, does not incur an asymptotic bias, and
outperforms the indirect approach for larger datasets. Ultimately, by revealing
the existence of two non-asymptotic regimes for the performance of direct and
indirect data-driven predictive control designs, our study suggests that
neither approach is invariably superior and that the choice of design must, in
practice, be informed by the available dataset.

perceive input samples injected with imperceptible perturbations. Recently,
adversarial attack has been applied to visual object tracking to evaluate the
robustness of deep trackers. Assuming that the model structures of deep
trackers are known, a variety of white-box attack approaches to visual tracking
have demonstrated promising results. However, the model knowledge about deep
trackers is usually unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we propose
a decision-based black-box attack method for visual object tracking. In
contrast to existing black-box adversarial attack methods that deal with static
images for image classification, we propose IoU attack that sequentially
generates perturbations based on the predicted IoU scores from both current and
historical frames. By decreasing the IoU scores, the proposed attack method
degrades the accuracy of temporal coherent bounding boxes (i.e., object
motions) accordingly. In addition, we transfer the learned perturbations to the
next few frames to initialize temporal motion attack. We validate the proposed
IoU attack on state-of-the-art deep trackers (i.e., detection based,
correlation filter based, and long-term trackers). Extensive experiments on the
benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed IoU attack
method. The source code is available at

blending in the image space to estimate the coarse HDR video. Secondly, we
conduct more sophisticated alignment and temporal fusion in the feature space
of the coarse HDR video to produce better reconstruction. Considering the fact
that there is no publicly available dataset for quantitative and comprehensive

revealed the possible presence of two giant planets in the process of forming.
The young measured age of $1-4$Myr for this system allows us to place strict
time constraints on the formation histories of the observed planets. Hence we
may be able to make a crucial distinction between formation through core
accretion (CA) or the gravitational instability (GI), as CA formation
timescales are typically Myrs whilst formation through GI will occur within the
first $\approx10^4-10^5$yrs of disc evolution. We focus our analysis on the
$4-13$M$_{\rm Jup}$ planet observed at $R\approx30$AU. We find CA formation
timescales for such a massive planet typically exceed the system's age. The
planet's high mass and wide orbit may instead be indicative of formation
through GI. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to determine the
system's critical disc mass for fragmentation, finding $M_{\rm
d,crit}=0.3$M$_{\odot}$. Viscous evolution models of the disc's mass history
indicate that it was likely massive enough to exceed $M_{\rm d,crit}$ in the
recent past, thus it is possible that a young AB Aurigae disc may have
fragmented to form multiple giant gaseous protoplanets. Calculations of the
Jeans mass in an AB Aurigae-like disc find that fragments may initially form
with masses $1.6-13.3$M$_{\rm Jup}$, consistent with the planets which have
been observed. We therefore propose that the inferred planets in the disc
surrounding AB Aurigae may be evidence of planet formation through GI.

the distribution of the target class. During training, the novelty class is
absent, preventing the use of traditional classification approaches. Deep
autoencoders have been widely used as a base of many unsupervised novelty
detection methods. In particular, context autoencoders have been successful in
the novelty detection task because of the more effective representations they
learn by reconstructing original images from randomly masked images. However, a
significant drawback of context autoencoders is that random masking fails to
consistently cover important structures of the input image, leading to
suboptimal representations - especially for the novelty detection task. In this
paper, to optimize input masking, we have designed a framework consisting of
two competing networks, a Mask Module and a Reconstructor. The Mask Module is a
convolutional autoencoder that learns to generate optimal masks that cover the
most important parts of images. Alternatively, the Reconstructor is a
convolutional encoder-decoder that aims to reconstruct unperturbed images from
masked images. The networks are trained in an adversarial manner in which the
Mask Module generates masks that are applied to images given to the
Reconstructor. In this way, the Mask Module seeks to maximize the
reconstruction error that the Reconstructor is minimizing. When applied to
novelty detection, the proposed approach learns semantically richer
representations compared to context autoencoders and enhances novelty detection
at test time through more optimal masking. Novelty detection experiments on the

superiority over cutting-edge methods. In a further experiment on the UCSD

by flying in formations; all but the leading aircraft can benefit from the

of aircraft in such a formation increases is that disturbances at one aircraft,
for example caused by turbulence or wake meandering, can propagate and grow as
each following aircraft tries to track the optimal energy-saving position
relative to the one in front. This phenomenon, known as string instability, has
not yet been adequately examined in the context of aircraft formations. We
discuss some trade-offs involved in designing string stable controllers whose
objective is to minimize energy, and present a control design method to achieve
both string stability and energy efficiency of an aircraft formation. In
simulations of a 10-aircraft linear formation in the presence of 2% turbulence

further on a previously introduced method for generating canonical, dimension

prior has high mass. This is a desirable feature since, generally, such areas
produce semantically meaningful samples. In this paper, we extend the bridge
process method by introducing a discriminator network that accurately
identifies areas of high latent representation density. The discriminator
network is incorporated as a change of measure of the underlying bridge process
and sampling of interpolation paths is implemented using sequential Monte
Carlo. The resulting sampling procedure allows for greater variability in
interpolation paths and stronger drift towards areas of high data density.

prominent search domains and is equipped with a self-adaptive mechanism to
control the dynamic tightening of the prominent domains while the greediness of
the algorithm increases over time (iterations). Unlike traditional
metaheuristics, the proposed method has no direct mutation- or crossover-like
operations. It depends solely on the sequential random sampling that can be
used in diversification and intensification processes while keeping the
information-flow between generations and the structural bias at a minimum. By
using a simple topology, the algorithm avoids premature convergence by sampling
new solutions every generation. A simple theoretical derivation revealed that
the exploration of this approach is unbiased and the rate of the
diversification is constant during the runtime. The trade-off balance between
the diversification and the intensification is explained theoretically and
experimentally. This proposed approach has been benchmarked against standard
optimisation problems as well as a selected set of simple and complex
engineering applications. We used 26 standard benchmarks with different
properties that cover most of the optimisation problems' nature, three
traditional engineering problems, and one real complex engineering problem from
the state-of-the-art literature. The algorithm performs well in finding global
minima for nonconvex and multimodal functions, especially with high dimensional

plastic quantities. The global minimization structure demands a
$H($div$)$-conforming finite-element formulation. Furthermore this is combined
with an enhanced-assumed-strain formulation in order to overcome locking
phenomena arising from the plastic deformations. The robustness and

The variational formulation of finite elasticity coupled with Fickian diffusion
has a two-field minimization structure, wherein the deformation map and the
fluid-volume flux are obtained as minimizers of a time-discrete potential
involving internal and external energetic contributions. Following spatial
discretization, the minimization principle is implemented using a conforming
Q$_1$RT$_0$ finite-element design, making use of the lowest-order
Raviart-Thomas-type interpolations for the fluid-volume flux. To analyze the
structural stability of a certain equilibrium state of the gel satisfying the
minimization principle, we apply the local stability criterion on the
incremental potential, which is based on the idea that a stable equilibrium
state has the lowest potential energy among all possible states within an
infinitesimal neighborhood. Using this criterion, it is understood that
bifurcation-type structural instabilities are activated when the coupled global
finite-element stiffness matrix loses its positive definiteness. This concept
is then applied to determine the onset and nature of wrinkling instabilities
occurring in a pair of representative film-substrate hydrogel systems. In

innumerable applications in the context of modeling spatiotemporal behaviors

Although learning the spatiotemporal parameters of DT-FODS is not a new

performance standards. Therefore, we need to understand the trade-offs between
sample complexity and estimation accuracy of the system parameters. Simply
speaking, we need to address the question of how many measurements we need to
collect to identify the system parameters up to an uncertainty level. In this
paper, we address the problem of identifying the spatial and temporal

dependence on artificial intelligence, it is increasingly important to have
models that can perform well under different, possibly adverse, conditions.
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using convolutional layers are state-of-the-art in
many tasks in communications. However, in other domains, like image
classification, DNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations, which consist of imperceptible crafted noise that when added to
the data fools the model into misclassification. This puts into question the
security of DNNs in communication tasks, and in particular in modulation
recognition. We propose a novel framework to test the robustness of current
state-of-the-art models where the adversarial perturbation strength is
dependent on the signal strength and measured with the ""signal to perturbation
ratio"" (SPR). We show that current state-of-the-art models are susceptible to
these perturbations. In contrast to current research on the topic of image
classification, modulation recognition allows us to have easily accessible
insights on the usefulness of the features learned by DNNs by looking at the
constellation space. When analyzing these vulnerable models we found that
adversarial perturbations do not shift the symbols towards the nearest classes
in constellation space. This shows that DNNs do not base their decisions on
signal statistics that are important for the Bayes-optimal modulation
recognition model, but spurious correlations in the training data. Our feature
analysis and proposed framework can help in the task of finding better models
for communication systems.

instrument control and data processing for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectrometer. NMR software should allow researchers to flexibly implement
various functionality according to the requirement of applications. Scripting
system can offer an open environment for NMR users to write custom programs
with basic libraries. Emerging technologies, especially multivariate
statistical analysis and artificial intelligence, have been successfully
applied to NMR applications such as metabolomics and biomacromolecules.
Scripting system should support more complex NMR libraries, which will enable
the emerging technologies to be easily implemented in the scripting
environment. Result: Here, a novel NMR scripting system named ""NMRPy"" is
introduced. In the scripting system, both Java based NMR methods and original
CPython based libraries are supported. A module was built as a bridge to
integrate the runtime environment of Java and CPython. It works as an extension
in CPython environment, as well as interacts with Java part by Java Native
Interface. Leveraging the bridge, Java based instrument control and data
processing methods can be called as a CPython style. Compared with traditional
scripting system, NMRPy is easier for NMR researchers to develop complex
functionality with fast numerical computation, multivariate statistical
analysis, deep learning etc. Non-uniform sampling and protein structure
prediction methods based on deep learning can be conveniently integrated into
NMRPy. Conclusion: NMRPy offers a user-friendly environment to implement custom

advancements and hardware-assisted computation enhancements. However, those
methods focus on arithmetic accelerations and overlook the benefits of the
underlying system's structure. In particular, the existing decoupled
software-hardware algorithm design that naively parallelizes the arithmetic
operations by the hardware does not tackle the hardware overheads such as
CPU-GPU and thread-to-thread communications in a principled manner. Also, the
advantages of parallelizable subproblem decomposition in distributed MPC are
not well recognized and exploited. As a result, we have not reached the full

DLMPC formulation to reduce the hardware-intrinsic communication overheads. Our
parallel implementation achieves up to 50x faster runtime than its CPU

locality-aware GPU parallelization could halve the optimization runtime

millions of variables and clauses, despite the theoretical intractability of
the SAT problem. This gap between practice and theory is a central problem in
solver research. It is believed that SAT solvers exploit structure inherent in
industrial instances, and hence there have been numerous attempts over the last
25 years at characterizing this structure via parameters. These can be
classified as rigorous, i.e., they serve as a basis for complexity-theoretic
upper bounds (e.g., backdoors), or correlative, i.e., they correlate well with
solver run time and are observed in industrial instances (e.g., community
structure). Unfortunately, no parameter proposed to date has been shown to be
both strongly correlative and rigorous over a large fraction of industrial
instances. Given the sheer difficulty of the problem, we aim for an
intermediate goal of proposing a set of parameters that is strongly correlative
and has good theoretical properties. Specifically, we propose parameters based
on a graph partitioning called Hierarchical Community Structure (HCS), which
captures the recursive community structure of a graph of a Boolean formula. We
show that HCS parameters are strongly correlative with solver run time using an
Empirical Hardness Model, and further build a classifier based on HCS
parameters that distinguishes between easy industrial and hard random/crafted
instances with very high accuracy. We further strengthen our hypotheses via
scaling studies. On the theoretical side, we show that counterexamples which
plagued community structure do not apply to HCS, and that there is a subset of
HCS parameters such that restricting them limits the size of embeddable
expanders.

proactively offer support by inferring their preferences in sequencing the task
actions. Previous work has focused on learning the dominant preferences of
human workers for simple tasks largely based on their intended goal. However,
people may have preferences at different resolutions: they may share the same
high-level preference for the order of the sub-tasks but differ in the sequence
of individual actions. We propose a two-stage approach for learning and
inferring the preferences of human operators based on the sequence of sub-tasks
and actions. We conduct an IKEA assembly study and demonstrate how our approach
is able to learn the dominant preferences in a complex task. We show that our
approach improves the prediction of human actions through cross-validation.
Lastly, we show that our two-stage approach improves the efficiency of task
execution in an online experiment, and demonstrate its applicability in a
real-world robot-assisted IKEA assembly.

Union due to energy efficiency related directives. Many buildings that must
undergo deep energy renovation are old and may lack design/renovation
documentation, or possible degradation of materials might have occurred in
building elements over time. Thermal transmittance (i.e. U-value) is one of the
most important parameters for determining the transmission heat losses through
building envelope elements. It depends on the thickness and thermal properties
of all the materials that form a building element. In-situ U-value can be
determined by ISO 9869-1 standard (Heat Flux Method - HFM). Still, measurement
duration is one of the reasons why HFM is not widely used in field testing
before the renovation design process commences. This paper analyzes the
possibility of reducing the measurement time by conducting parallel
measurements with one heat-flux sensor. This parallelization could be achieved
by applying a specific class of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on HFM
results to predict unknown heat flux based on collected interior and exterior
air temperatures. After the satisfying prediction is achieved, HFM sensor can
be relocated to another measuring location. Paper shows a comparison of four
ANN cases applied to HFM results for a measurement held on one multi-layer wall
- multilayer perceptron with three neurons in one hidden layer, long short-term
memory with 100 units, gated recurrent unit with 100 units and combination of
50 long short-term memory units and 50 gated recurrent units. The analysis gave
promising results in term of predicting the heat flux rate based on the two
input temperatures. Additional analysis on another wall showed possible
limitations of the method that serves as a direction for further research on
this topic.

supported by experimental studies performed with the use of the noisy quantum

the identical regions, each of diameter $d$. More generally, effective field
theories (EFTs), describing a system up to a given momentum scale $\Lambda$,

encryption scheme with the following attractive feature: given a ciphertext, an
adversary cannot create two ciphertexts both of which decrypt to the same
message as the original ciphertext. We revisit this notion and show the
following:
  - Reusability: The constructions proposed by Broadbent and Lord have the
disadvantage that they either guarantee one-time security (that is, the
encryption key can only be used once to encrypt the message) in the plain model
or they guaranteed security in the random oracle model. We construct unclonable
encryption schemes with semantic security. We present two constructions (for
public-key and private-key settings) from minimal cryptographic assumptions.
  - Lower Bound and Generalized Construction: We revisit the
information-theoretic one-time secure construction of Broadbent and Lord. The
success probability of the adversary in their construction was guaranteed to be
$0.85^n$, where $n$ is the length of the message. It was interesting to
understand whether the ideal success probability of (negligibly close to)
$0.5^n$ was unattainable. We generalize their construction to be based on a
broader class of monogamy of entanglement games. We demonstrate a simple
cloning attack that succeeds with probability $0.71^n$ against a class of
schemes including that of Broadbent and Lord. We also present a $0.75^n$
cloning attack exclusively against their scheme.
  - Implication to Copy-Protection: We show that unclonable encryption,
satisfying a stronger property, called unclonable-indistinguishability (defined
by Broadbent and Lord), implies copy-protection for a simple class of
unlearnable functions. While we currently don't have encryption schemes
satisfying this stronger property, this implication demonstrates a new path to
construct copy-protection.

efforts to provide stability guarantees for these methods. However, current
theoretical guarantees require that each (generally nonconvex) planning problem
can be solved to (approximate) global optimality, which is an unrealistic
requirement for the derivative-based local optimization methods generally used
in practical implementations of RHC. This paper takes the first step towards
understanding stability guarantees for nonlinear RHC when the inner planning
problem is solved to first-order stationary points, but not necessarily global
optima. Special attention is given to feedback linearizable systems, and a
mixture of positive and negative results are provided. We establish that, under
certain strong conditions, first-order solutions to RHC exponentially stabilize
linearizable systems. Crucially, this guarantee requires that state costs
applied to the planning problems are in a certain sense `compatible' with the
global geometry of the system, and a simple counter-example demonstrates the
necessity of this condition. These results highlight the need to rethink the
role of global geometry in the context of optimization-based control.

space $E$ of dimension $n$ with associated vector space $V$ of dimension $n$. A
(non-zero) sliding vector is a vector in $V$ that is free to move, but only
within a line $L$ of $E$. The set of sliding vectors has dimension $2n-1$. This
set is naturally embedded in a vector space of dimension ${n +1 \choose 2}$. An
element of this vector space will be called a line bivector. Other terms used
in applications are screw and wrench. There is a nice description of line
bivectors in terms of Grassmann algebra in a projective representation. It is
shown that this abstract description has a concrete realization in terms of
moment functions from $E$ to bivectors over $V$. The literature in physics and
engineering mainly deals with the special case $n=3$. The results of the paper
apply in this case and to its most common application, where the vectors in $V$
represent force and the bivectors over $V$ represent torque. It concludes with
a discussion of duality, such as that of force and velocity or of torque and
angular velocity.

luminosities of Galactic BH binaries in the quiescent state are far below the
Eddington luminosity, and thus, radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs)
are formed in the inner region. Strong thermal and turbulent pressures in RIAFs
produce outflows, which can create large-scale poloidal magnetic fields. These
fields are carried to the vicinity of the BH by the rapid inflow motion,
forming a MAD. Inside the MAD, non-thermal protons and electrons are naturally
accelerated by magnetic reconnections or stochastic acceleration by turbulence.
Both thermal and non-thermal electrons emit broadband photons via synchrotron
emission, which are broadly consistent with the optical and X-ray data of the
quiescent BH X-ray binaries. Moreover, protons are accelerated up to PeV
energies and diffusively escape from these MADs, which can account for the
cosmic-ray intensity around the knee energy.

correlated activity between them? Several explanations have been proposed but
one possibility has not been considered: perhaps more neural activity doesn't
imply more functional involvement. This article examines this possibility and
proposes a new general framework for understanding brain network dynamics based
on the design constraints of large-scale network communication systems. With
this new perspective, we may start to answer the article's main question, and
perhaps others.

and control of nonlinear systems: the Koopman operator framework and
contraction analysis. Each method, in different ways, provides exact and global
analyses of nonlinear systems by way of linear systems theory. The main results
of this paper show equivalence between contraction and Koopman approaches for a
wide class of stability analysis and control design problems. In particular:
stability or stablizability in the Koopman framework implies the existence of a
contraction metric (resp. control contraction metric) for the nonlinear system.
Further in certain cases the converse holds: contraction implies the existence
of a set of observables with which stability can be verified via the Koopman
framework. We provide results for the cases of autonomous and time-varying
systems, as well as orbital stability of limit cycles. Furthermore, the
converse claims are based on a novel relation between the Koopman method and
construction of a Kazantzis-Kravaris-Luenberger observer. We also provide a
byproduct of the main results, that is, a new method to learn contraction
metrics from trajectory data via linear system identification.

components which only penalize the point-to-point distance between the two

Surface Geometry (LSG-CPD) for rigid point cloud registration. Our method
adaptively adds different levels of point-to-plane penalization on top of the
point-to-point penalization based on the flatness of the local surface. This
results in GMM components with anisotropic covariances. We formulate point
cloud registration as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and solve
it with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E step, we
demonstrate that the computation can be recast into simple matrix manipulations

Using particle based simulations incorporating both activity (birth, death and
growth) and systematic physical interactions (elasticity and adhesion), we
establish that inter-particle adhesion strength ($f^{ad}$) controls the surface
roughness of a densely packed three-dimensional(3D) active particle aggregate
expanding into a highly viscous medium. We discover that the surface roughness
of a 3D active particle aggregate increases in proportion to the inter-particle
adhesion strength, $f^{ad}$. We show that asymmetry in the radial and
tangential active particle mean squared displacement (MSD) suppresses 3D
surface roughness at lower adhesion strengths. By analyzing the statistical
properties of particle displacements at the aggregate periphery, we determine
that the 3D surface roughness is driven by the movement of active particle
towards the core at high inter-particle adhesion strengths. Our results
elucidate the physics controlling the expansion of adhesive 3D active particle
collectives into a highly viscous medium, with implications into understanding
stochastic interface growth in active matter systems characterized by self

thermal conductivity (klat ~ 0.34 at 400 K). In order to accurately obtain
electrical as well as thermal transport coefficient, we adopt deformation

synergistically results in such high thermoelectric performance with the
development of new n-type thermoelectric material working at the

sense the world around them and to guide their decision making as they perform
diverse tasks such as collision avoidance, search and rescue, and object
manipulation. High accuracy is critical, particularly for Human-on-the-loop
(HoTL) systems where decisions are made autonomously by the system, and humans
play only a supervisory role. Failures of the vision model can lead to
erroneous decisions with potentially life or death consequences. In this paper,
we propose a solution based upon adaptive autonomy levels, whereby the system
detects loss of reliability of these models and responds by temporarily
lowering its own autonomy levels and increasing engagement of the human in the
decision-making process. Our solution is applicable for vision-based tasks in
which humans have time to react and provide guidance. When implemented, our
approach would estimate the reliability of the vision task by considering
uncertainty in its model, and by performing covariate analysis to determine
when the current operating environment is ill-matched to the model's training
data. We provide examples from DroneResponse, in which small Unmanned Aerial
Systems are deployed for Emergency Response missions, and show how the vision
model's reliability would be used in addition to confidence scores to drive and
specify the behavior and adaptation of the system's autonomy. This workshop
paper outlines our proposed approach and describes open challenges at the
intersection of Computer Vision and Software Engineering for the safe and
reliable deployment of vision models in the decision making of autonomous

methods to consider the negative impact caused by certain views with unclear

address this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature
learning for deep multi-view clustering (SDMVC). Concretely, deep autoencoders
are applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. To leverage
the multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views' embedded
features to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of
some views' unclear clustering structures. In a self-supervised manner,
pseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform
multi-view discriminative feature learning. During this process, global
discriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more
discriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target
distribution. Besides, this unified target distribution can make SDMVC learn
consistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency
of multiple views while preserving their features' diversity. Experiments on
various types of multi-view datasets show that SDMVC achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

learning over complex real-world 3D meshes. Hierarchical neural architectures
have proved effective in multi-scale feature extraction which signifies the
need for fast mesh decimation. However, existing methods rely on CPU-based
implementations to obtain multi-resolution meshes. We design GPU-accelerated
mesh decimation to facilitate network resolution reduction efficiently
on-the-fly. Pooling and unpooling modules are defined on the vertex clusters
gathered during decimation. For feature learning over meshes, Picasso contains
three types of novel convolutions namely, facet2vertex, vertex2facet, and
facet2facet convolution. Hence, it treats a mesh as a geometric structure
comprising vertices and facets, rather than a spatial graph with edges as
previous methods do. Picasso also incorporates a fuzzy mechanism in its filters
for robustness to mesh sampling (vertex density). It exploits Gaussian mixtures
to define fuzzy coefficients for the facet2vertex convolution, and barycentric
interpolation to define the coefficients for the remaining two convolutions. In
this release, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules with
competitive segmentation results on S3DIS. The library will be made public

still an open question whether VQAs can be competitive with state-of-the-art
classical algorithms based on neural networks (NNs) even on simple benchmark

architectural choices for quantum Q-learning agents are most important for
successfully solving certain types of environments by performing ablation
studies for a number of different data encoding and readout strategies. We
provide insight into why the performance of a VQA-based Q-learning algorithm
crucially depends on the observables of the quantum model and show how to
choose suitable observables based on the learning task at hand. To compare our
model against the classical DQN algorithm, we perform an extensive
hyperparameter search of PQCs and NNs with varying numbers of parameters. We
confirm that similar to results in classical literature, the architectural
choices and hyperparameters contribute more to the agents' success in a RL
setting than the number of parameters used in the model. Finally, we show when
recent separation results between classical and quantum agents for policy

sensitive to the band shape of QAH states. For example, dispersive QAH bands
shows resonance profile without a sign change at the band gap while the IQH
states shows the sign change resonance at the cyclotron energy. We argue by
flattening the dispersive QAH bands, $\sigma_{yx}(\omega)$ should recover to
that of flat Landau bands in IQH, thus it is necessary to know the origin of
the sign change. Taking a topological lattice model with tunable bandwidth, we
found that the origin of the sign change is not the band gap but the Van Hove
singularity energy of the QAH bands. In the limit of small bandwidth, the flat
QAH bands recovers $\sigma_{yx}(\omega)$ of the IQH Landau bands. Because of
the Hall response, these topological bands exhibit giant polarization rotation
and ellipticity in the reflected waves (Kerr effect) and rotation in the order

proposed to maintain classification performance on known classes and reject

known class instances, so that calibration and thresholding across categories
become essential issues when extending to an open-set environment. To this end,
we proposed to learn PlaceholdeRs for Open-SEt Recognition (Proser), which

strategy frequently confuse context with the actual action, in the localization
result. Separating action and context is a core problem for precise WS-TAL, but
it is very challenging and has been largely ignored in the literature. In this
paper, we introduce an Action-Context Separation Network (ACSNet) that
explicitly takes into account context for accurate action localization. It
consists of two branches (i.e., the Foreground-Background branch and the
Action-Context branch). The Foreground- Background branch first distinguishes
foreground from background within the entire video while the Action-Context
branch further separates the foreground as action and context. We associate
video snippets with two latent components (i.e., a positive component and a
negative component), and their different combinations can effectively
characterize foreground, action and context. Furthermore, we introduce extended
labels with auxiliary context categories to facilitate the learning of
action-context separation. Experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.2/v1.3

the parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) based on possibly
unbalanced data. Inference with this model is typically done based on
asymptotic theory, assuming that the number of clusters tends to infinity with
the sample size. However, when the number of clusters is fixed, classical
asymptotic theory developed under a divergent number of clusters is no longer
valid and can lead to erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we establish the
asymptotic properties of the ML estimators of random-effects parameters under a
general setting, which can be applied to conduct valid statistical inference
with fixed numbers of clusters. Our asymptotic theorems allow both fixed
effects and random effects to be misspecified, and the dimensions of both
effects to go to infinity with the sample size.

complexity that illustrate how algorithms and models can be designed for making
efficient, accurate, and robust predictions of stock prices. We present a gamut
of ten deep learning models of regression for precise and robust prediction of
the future prices of the stock of a critical company in the auto sector of

(CNN) to enhance the feature representation. However, existing attention
mechanisms only concentrate on refining the features inside each sample and
neglect the discrimination between different samples. In this paper, we propose
a batch aware attention module (BA2M) for feature enrichment from a distinctive
perspective. More specifically, we first get the sample-wise attention
representation (SAR) by fusing the channel, local spatial and global spatial
attention maps within each sample. Then, we feed the SARs of the whole batch to
a normalization function to get the weights for each sample. The weights serve
to distinguish the features' importance between samples in a training batch
with different complexity of content. The BA2M could be embedded into different
parts of CNN and optimized with the network in an end-to-end manner. The design
of BA2M is lightweight with few extra parameters and calculations. We validate
BA2M through extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K for the image
recognition task. The results show that BA2M can boost the performance of
various network architectures and outperforms many classical attention methods.
Besides, BA2M exceeds traditional methods of re-weighting samples based on the
loss value.

in the same area. Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches are proposed based
on taking a matching network with a heavy structure to distinguish the target
from other objects in the area which indeed drastically downgrades the
performance of the tracker in terms of speed. Besides, several candidates are
considered and processed to localize the intended object in a region of
interest for each frame which is time-consuming. In this article, a special
architecture is proposed based on which in contrast to the previous approaches,
it is possible to identify the object location in a single shot while taking
its template into account to distinguish it from the similar objects in the
same area. In brief, first of all, a window containing the object with twice
the target size is considered. This window is then fed into a fully
convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract a region of interest (RoI) in a
form of a matrix for each of the frames. In the beginning, a template of the
target is also taken as the input to the CNN. Considering this RoI matrix, the
next movement of the tracker is determined based on a simple and fast method.
Moreover, this matrix helps to estimate the object size which is crucial when
it changes over time. Despite the absence of a matching network, the presented
tracker performs comparatively with the SOTA in challenging situations while
having a super speed compared to them (up to $120 FPS$ on 1080ti). To
investigate this claim, a comparison study is carried out on the GOT-10k

a Discriminative Sample Meta-Mining (DSMM) approach in this paper. Unlike

discriminative information from data. Specifically, we sample an unbalanced
train batch and a balanced meta-train batch for each iteration. Then we learn a
meta-miner with the meta-gradient on the balanced meta-train batch. In the end,
the samples in the unbalanced train batch are re-weighted by the learned
meta-miner to optimize the kinship models. Experimental results on the widely

computational burden of our approach is limited, since additional solution of
possibly larger (non-)linear systems for regularized shape gradients is not
necessary. We implement and compare pre-shape gradient regularization
approaches for a hard to solve 2D problem. As our approach does not depend on
the choice of metrics representing shape gradients, we employ and compare
several different metrics.

  Minor changes in the main text",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose the gentle measurement principle (GMP) as one of the principles at
the foundation of quantum mechanics. It asserts that if a set of states can be
distinguished with high probability, they can be distinguished by a measurement
that leaves the states almost invariant, including correlation with a reference
system. While GMP is satisfied in both classical and quantum theories, we show,
within the framework of general probabilistic theories, that it imposes strong
restrictions on the law of physics. First, the measurement uncertainty of a
pair of observables cannot be significantly larger than the preparation
uncertainty. Consequently, the strength of the CHSH nonlocality cannot be
maximal. The parameter in the stretched quantum theory, a family of general
probabilistic theories that includes the quantum theory, is also limited.
Second, the conditional entropy defined in terms of a data compression theorem
satisfies the chain inequality. Not only does it imply information causality
and Tsirelson's bound, but it singles out the quantum theory from the stretched
one. All these results show that GMP would be one of the principles at the
heart of quantum mechanics.

report here on the characterization and testing of five prototype detectors

Ge detectors with the superior resolution and pulse shape discrimination power
of point contact detectors which exhibited so far much lower mass. Their
performance has been found to be satisfactory both when operated in vacuum
cryostat and bare in liquid argon within the GERDA setup. The measured
resolutions at the Q-value for double-$\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge
(Q$_{\beta\beta}$ = 2039 keV) are about 2.1 keV full width at half maximum in
vacuum cryostat. After 18 months of operation within the ultra-low background
environment of the GERmanium Detector Array (GERDA) experiment and an
accumulated exposure of 8.5 kg$\cdot$yr, the background index after analysis
cuts is measured to be $4.9^{+7.3}_{-3.4}\times 10^{-4}$ counts

the oscillatory dynamo mechanism in the Sun. Solar cycles were directly
observed since 1700, while indirect proxies suggest their existence over a much
longer period of time but generally without resolving individual cycles and
their continuity. Here we reconstruct individual cycles for the last millennium
using recent 14C data and state-of-the-art models. Starting with the 14C
production rate determined from the so far most precise measurements of
radiocarbon content in tree rings, solar activity is reconstructed in three
physics-based steps: (1) Correction of the 14C production rate for the changing
geomagnetic field; (2) Computation of the open solar magnetic flux; and (3)
Conversion into sunspot numbers outside of grand minima. Solar activity is
reconstructed for the period 971-1900 (85 individual cycles). This more than
doubles the number of solar cycles known from direct solar observations. We
found that lengths and strengths of well-defined cycles outside grand minima
are consistent with those obtained from the direct sunspot observations after
1750. The validity of the Waldmeier rule is confirmed at a highly significant
level. Solar activity is found to be in a deep grand minimum when the activity
is mostly below the sunspot formation threshold, during about 250 years.
Therefore, although considerable cyclic variability in 14C is seen even during
grand minima, individual solar cycles can hardly be reliably resolved therein.
Three potential solar particle events, ca. 994, 1052 and 1279 AD, are shown. A
new about 1000-year long solar activity reconstruction, in the form of annual
(pseudo) sunspot numbers with full assessment of uncertainties, is presented
based on new high-precision 14C measurements and state-of-the-art models, more
than doubling the number of individually resolved solar cycles.

transition is of first order, where the low-density hadronic matter described
in a unified manner by the soft QMF or the stiff DD2 equation of state (EOS)
transforms into a high-density phase of quark matter modeled by the generic
""Constant-sound-speed"" (CSS) parameterization. The mass distribution measured
for the $2.14 \,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ pulsar, MSP J0740+6620, is used as the lower

maximum mass are $M_{\rm TOV}=2.36^{+0.49}_{-0.26}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$

bound around $2.85\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$, to the $90\%$ posterior credible level.

outbursts of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. To address this problem,
we concentrate on the basic reproduction number $R_0$, which is not sensitive
to testing coverage and represents transmissibility in an absence of social
distancing and in a completely susceptible population. While many variables may
potentially influence $R_0$, a high correlation between these variables may
obscure the result interpretation. Consequently, we combine Principal Component
Analysis with feature selection methods from several regression-based
approaches to identify the main demographic and meteorological drivers behind
$R_0$. We robustly obtain that country's wealth/development (GDP per capita or
Human Development Index) is the most important $R_0$ predictor at the global
level, probably being a good proxy for the overall contact frequency in a
population. This main effect is modulated by built-up area per capita
(crowdedness in indoor space), onset of infection (likely related to increased
awareness of infection risks), net migration, unhealthy living
lifestyle/conditions including pollution, seasonality, and possibly BCG
vaccination prevalence. Also, we argue that several variables that
significantly correlate with transmissibility do not directly influence $R_0$
or affect it differently than suggested by naive analysis.

only partially covered over three epochs, traditional methods to extract the
planet flux and instrument systematic errors cannot recover the thermal
emission away from the secondary eclipse. To analyse this partial phase curve,
we introduce a new method, which corrects for the wavelength-independent
component of the systematic errors. Our new method removes the achromatic
instrument and stellar variability, and uses the measured stellar spectrum in
eclipse to then retrieve a relative planetary spectrum in wavelength at each
phase. We are able to extract the emission spectrum of an exoplanet at
quadrature outside of a phase curve for the first time; we recover the
quadrature spectrum of WASP-12b up to an additive constant. The dayside
emission spectrum is extracted in a similar manner, and in both cases we are
able to estimate the brightness temperature, albeit at a greatly reduced
precision. We estimate the brightness temperature from the dayside
(Tday=3186+-677 K) and from the quadrature spectrum (Tquad=2124+-417 K) and
combine them to constrain the energy budget of the planet. We compare our
extracted relative spectra to global circulation models of this planet, which
are generally found to be a good match. However, we do see tentative evidence
of a steeper spectral slope in the measured dayside spectrum compared to our
models. We find that we cannot match this increased slope by increasing optical
opacities in our models. We also find that this spectral slope is unlikely to
be explained by a non-equilibrium water abundance, as water advected from the
nightside is quickly dissociated on the dayside.

multi-agent metaheuristic derivative-free optimization method that can globally
minimize nonconvex nonsmooth functions and is amenable to theoretical analysis.
Based on an experimentally supported intuition that, on average, CBO performs a
gradient descent of the squared Euclidean distance to the global minimizer, we
devise a novel technique for proving the convergence to the global minimizer in
mean-field law for a rich class of objective functions. The result unveils
internal mechanisms of CBO that are responsible for the success of the method.
In particular, we prove that CBO performs a convexification of a very large
class of optimization problems as the number of optimizing agents goes to
infinity. Furthermore, we improve prior analyses by requiring minimal
assumptions about the initialization of the method and by covering objectives
that are merely locally Lipschitz continuous. As a core component of this
analysis, we establish a quantitative nonasymptotic Laplace principle, which
may be of independent interest. From the result of CBO convergence in
mean-field law, it becomes apparent that the hardness of any global
optimization problem is necessarily encoded in the rate of the mean-field
approximation, for which we provide a novel probabilistic quantitative
estimate. The combination of these results allows to obtain global convergence
guarantees of the numerical CBO method with provable polynomial complexity.

under the assumptions of an inviscid and incompressible fluid, which is
modelled by a potential flow model with fully non-linear boundary conditions at
the free-surface. The unsteady boundary value problem with a free-surface is
numerically solved through a boundary element method, coupled to a simplified
finite element method to describe the thinnest part of the jet. The study is
aimed at describing the entry and exit phases. Specific numerical solutions are
developed to tackle the exit phase and to improve the stability of the model.
Results are presented in terms of free-surface shape, pressure distribution and
hydrodynamic load acting on the impacting body. The model is used to study the
water entry and exit of a 2D wedge and an axisymmetric cone, for which
numerical or experimental results are available in the literature. The
numerical investigation shows that the proposed model accurately simulate both
the entry and exit phases. For the exit phase, it is shown that the proposed
model, being fully non-linear, provides a much better prediction of the loads

of the gravity, usually missing in the approaches available in the literature,
are also investigated, showing they are rather important, especially, in the

shown to offer improved radiation resistance over their elemental or

introduce carbon and nitrogen interstitial alloying elements to impart chemical
heterogeneities in the form of the local chemical order (LCO) and associated
compositional variations. Density functional theory simulations predict
chemical short-range order (CSRO) (nearest neighbors and the next couple of
atomic shells) surrounding C and N, due to the chemical affinity of C with (Co,
Fe) and N with (Cr, Mn). Atomic-resolution chemical mapping of the elemental
distribution confirms marked compositional variations well beyond statistical
fluctuations. Ni+ irradiation experiments at elevated temperatures demonstrate
a remarkable reduction in void swelling by at least one order of magnitude
compared to the base HEA without C and N alloying. The underlying mechanism is
that the interstitial-solute-induced chemical heterogeneities roughen the
lattice as well as the energy landscape, impeding the movements of, and
constraining the path lanes for, the normally fast-moving self-interstitials
and their clusters. The irradiation-produced interstitials and vacancies
therefore recombine more readily, delaying void formation. Our findings thus
open a promising avenue towards highly radiation-tolerant alloys.

(FER) has received a lot of interest, with continual improvement in the
performance. Hand-in-hand with performance, new challenges have come up. Modern
FER systems deal with face images captured under uncontrolled conditions (also
called in-the-wild scenario) including occlusions and pose variations. They
successfully handle such conditions using deep networks that come with various
components like transfer learning, attention mechanism and local-global context
extractor. However, these deep networks are highly complex with large number of
parameters, making them unfit to be deployed in real scenarios. Is it possible
to build a light-weight network that can still show significantly good
performance on FER under in-the-wild scenario? In this work, we methodically
build such a network and call it as Imponderous Net. We leverage on the
aforementioned components of deep networks for FER, and analyse, carefully
choose and fit them to arrive at Imponderous Net. Our Imponderous Net is a low
calorie net with only 1.45M parameters, which is almost 50x less than that of a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) architecture. Further, during inference, it can process
at the real time rate of 40 frames per second (fps) in an intel-i7 cpu. Though
it is low calorie, it is still power packed in its performance, overpowering
other light-weight architectures and even few high capacity architectures.
Specifically, Imponderous Net reports 87.09\%, 88.17\% and 62.06\% accuracies
on in-the-wild datasets RAFDB, FERPlus and AffectNet respectively. It also
exhibits superior robustness under occlusions and pose variations in comparison

of this phenomenon has attracted considerable attention, but remains poorly
understood. In the present paper we use inelastic neutron scattering supported
by magnetization and specific heat measurements to study the spin dynamics in
the hard-axis ferromagnet CeAgSb2. In the zero field state we observed two
sharp magnon modes, which are associated with Ce ordering and extended up to
$\approx 3 meV with a considerable spin gap of 0.6 meV. Application of a
magnetic field perpendicular to the moment direction reduces the spectral
intensity and suppresses the gap and significantly enhances the low-temperature
specific heat at a critical field of Bc ~ 2.8 T via a mean-field-like
transition. Above the transition, in the field polarized state, the gap
eventually reopens due to the Zeeman effect. We modeled the observed dispersion
using linear spin-wave theory (LSWT) taking into account the ground state Gamma
6 doublet and exchange anisotropy. Our model correctly captures the essential
features of the spin dynamics including magnetic dispersion, distribution of
the spectral intensity as well as the field-induced behavior, although several
minor features remain obscure. The observed spectra do not show significant
broadening due to the finite lifetime of the quasiparticles. Along with a
moderate electronic specific heat coefficient gamma = 46 mJ/mol K2 this
indicates that the Kondo coupling is relatively weak and the Ce moments are
well localized. Altogether, our results provide profound insight into the spin
dynamics of the hard-axis ferromagnet CeAgSb2 and can be used as solid ground
for studying magnetic interactions in isostructural compounds including
CeAuSb2, which exhibits nematicity and unusual mesoscale magnetic textures.

uniaxial strain in the basal plane. The calculated in-plane $d_{22}$ value of
0.557 pm/V is small. However, more excitingly, the out-of-plane $d_{31}$ is as

for ultrathin piezoelectric devices. Moreover, strain engineering is used to

that compressive strain can improve the $d_{22}$, and tensile strain can

proposed by Galkin, Golyshev and Iritani, describes the asymptotic behavior of
the flat sections of the Dubrovin connection near the irregular singularities,
in terms of a full exceptional collection, if there exists, of $\mathcal
D^b(F)$ and the $\widehat{\Gamma}$-integral structure. In this paper, for the
smooth quadric hypersurfaces we prove the convergence of the full quantum
cohomology and the Gamma conjecture II.
  For the proof, we first give a criterion on Gamma II for Fano manifolds with
semisimple quantum cohomology, by Dubrovin's theorem of analytic continuations
of semisimple Frobenius manifolds. Then we work out a closed formula of the
Chern characters of spinor bundles on quadrics. By the deformation-invariance
of Gromov-Witten invariants we show that the full quantum cohomology can be
reconstructed by its ambient part, and use this to obtain estimations. Finally
we complete the proof of Gamma II for quadrics by explicit asymptotic
expansions of flat sections corresponding to Kapranov's exceptional collections
and an application of our criterion.

since they were introduced. In recent years, they have drawn attention from the
vision community in tasks such as image classification and object detection.
Despite this wave, an accurate and efficient multiple-object tracking (MOT)
method based on transformers is yet to be designed. We argue that the direct
application of a transformer architecture with quadratic complexity and
insufficient noise-initialized sparse queries - is not optimal for MOT. We
propose TransCenter, a transformer-based MOT architecture with dense
representations for accurately tracking all the objects while keeping a
reasonable runtime. Methodologically, we propose the use of image-related dense
detection queries and efficient sparse tracking queries produced by our
carefully designed query learning networks (QLN). On one hand, the dense
image-related detection queries allow us to infer targets' locations globally
and robustly through dense heatmap outputs. On the other hand, the set of
sparse tracking queries efficiently interacts with image features in our
TransCenter Decoder to associate object positions through time. As a result,
TransCenter exhibits remarkable performance improvements and outperforms by a
large margin the current state-of-the-art methods in two standard MOT
benchmarks with two tracking settings (public/private). TransCenter is also
proven efficient and accurate by an extensive ablation study and comparisons to
more naive alternatives and concurrent works. For scientific interest, the code
is made publicly available at https://github.com/yihongxu/transcenter.

discovered an incredible diversity of substructures in the dust emission. An
important result was the finding that dust grains of mm size are embedded in
very thin dusty disks. This implies that the dust mass fraction in the midplane
becomes comparable to the gas, increasing the importance of the interaction
between the two components there. We address this problem by means of numerical
2.5D simulations in order to study the gas and dust interaction in fully global
stratified disks. To this purpose, we employ the recently developed dust grain
module in the PLUTO code. Our model focuses on a typical T Tauri disk model,
simulating a short patch of the disk at 10 au which includes grains of constant
Stokes number of $St=0.01$ and $St=0.1$, corresponding to grains with sizes of
0.9 cm and 0.9 mm, respectively, for the given disk model. By injecting a
constant pebble flux at the outer domain, the system reaches a quasi steady
state of turbulence and dust concentrations driven by the streaming
instability. For our given setup and using resolutions up to 2500 cells per
scale height we resolve the streaming instability, leading to local dust
clumping and concentrations. Our results show dust density values of around
10-100 times the gas density with a steady state pebble flux between $3.5
\times 10^{-4}$ and $2.5 \times 10^{-3} M_{\rm Earth}/\mathit{year}$ for the
models with $\mathit{St}=0.01$ and $\mathit{St}=0.1$. The grain size and pebble
flux for model $\mathit{St}=0.01$ compares well with dust evolution models of
the first million years of disk evolution. For those grains the scatter opacity
dominates the extinction coefficient at mm wavelengths. These types of global
dust and gas simulations are a promising tool for studies of the gas and dust
evolution at pressure bumps in protoplanetary disks.

intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a candidate technology for future
6G networks. However, due to the ""multiplicative fading"" effect, the existing
passive RISs only achieve limited capacity gains in many scenarios with strong
direct links. In this paper, the concept of active RISs is proposed to overcome
this fundamental limitation. Unlike passive RISs that reflect signals without
amplification, active RISs can amplify the reflected signals via amplifiers
integrated into their elements. To characterize the signal amplification and
incorporate the noise introduced by the active components, we develop and
verify the signal model of active RISs through the experimental measurements
based on a fabricated active RIS element. Based on the verified signal model,
we further analyze the asymptotic performance of active RISs to reveal the
substantial capacity gain they provide for wireless communications. Finally, we
formulate the sum-rate maximization problem for an active RIS aided multi-user
multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system and a joint transmit beamforming
and reflect precoding scheme is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation
results show that, in a typical wireless system, passive RISs can realize only

sum-rate gain of 130%, thus overcoming the ""multiplicative fading"" effect.

two transparent electrodes (ITO), each covered with semiconductor-embedded,
active carbon (A-C) layer. While A-C appears black, it is not an ideal
blackbody absorber that absorbs all spectral light indiscriminately. In
addition to relatively flat optical absorption background, A-C exhibits two
distinct absorption bands: in the near-IR and in the blue. The first may be
attributed to absorption by OH- group and the latter, by scattering, possibly
by surface plasmons. Here, optical and thermal effects of sub-micron size SiC
particles that are embedded in A-C electrode, are presented. Similarly to
nano-Si particles, SiC exhibits blue band absorption, but it is less likely to
oxidize. Using Charge-Discharge (CD) experiments, the relative optically
related capacitance increase may be as large as ~34% (68% when the illuminated
area is taken into account). Capacitance increase was noted as the illuminated
samples became hotter. This thermal effect amounts to 20% of the overall
relative change using CD experiments. The thermal effect was quite large when
the SiC particles were replaced by CdSe/ZnS quatum dots; for the latter, the
thermal effect was 35% compared with 10% for the optical effect. When analyzing
the optical effect one may consider two processes: ionization of the
semiconductor particles and charge displacement under the cell's terminals - a
dipole effect. Our model suggests that the capacitance increase is related to

resolved optical emission spectroscopy (PROES), the electron heating dynamics
in the plasma discharge for customized electrodes, gas mixtures and applied

information in the real world. It has been used to solve the uncertainty
problems specially caused by lack of information. As a novel theory, the theory
can deal with various fields and plays an important role in modeling the small
sample problems. But many modeling mechanisms of grey system need to be
answered, such as why grey accumulation can be successfully applied to grey
prediction model? What is the key role of grey accumulation? Some scholars have
already given answers to a certain extent. In this paper, we explain the role
from the perspective of complex networks. Further, we propose generalized
conformable accumulation and difference, and clarify its physical meaning in
the grey model. We use our newly proposed fractional accumulation and
difference to our generalized conformable fractional grey model, or GCFGM(1,1),
and employ practical cases to verify that GCFGM(1,1) has higher accuracy
compared to traditional models.

into a different representation of the group than the gauge bosons. Despite the
fact that this twisting breaks supersymmetry, it is still possible to construct
an action that is holomorphic and invariant to local ``twisted'' gauge
transformations in superspace. It is conjectured that these two properties may
allow the theory to be free of quadratic divergences to all orders, despite a
lack of supersymmetry. An explicit calculation shows that the theory is free of

student engagement and participation in business schools, using more innovative
teaching practices. This is increasingly motivating scholars to strive for more
collaborative pedagogic dynamics between teachers and students. At the same
time, research into co-creation of Game Based Learning material such as board
games has largely focused on the value added to games when educators involve
students in the design process. However there has been scant research examining
the qualities of co-creational game design exercises as teaching experiences
themselves, thus overlooking the opportunity to conceptualise such activities
as an innovative teaching tool that can help educators facilitate student
engagement and participation. To address this research gap, this paper presents
a case study where Project Management students participated in two co-creation
workshops designing educational Project Management games. Data were collected
conducting focus groups at the end of the two workshops. Throughout the paper
we have sought to present some positive outcomes of such processes as well as
some critical points that emerged through the data that were collected.
Mentionable outcomes include a series of positive characteristics of
co-creative Game Based Learning activities like enhanced engagement as well as
a list of challenges when facilitating such activities. The main findings of
this research have been organised in two frameworks, one outlining five
positive characteristics of co-creative Game Based Learning activities:
engagement with knowledge, knowledge assessment, creativity, communication and
the second outlining challenges in facilitating such activities: lack of focus,
lack of structure and the need for more practice-oriented games.

drawing on an array of complex data-points, which require precise analysis for
accurate control and interventions to mitigate possible project failure.
Coupled with a growing tendency to rely on new information systems and
processes in change projects, 90% of megaprojects globally fail to achieve
their planned objectives. Renewed interest in the concept of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) against a backdrop of disruptive technological innovations,
seeks to enhance project managers cognitive capacity through the project
lifecycle and enhance project excellence. However, despite growing interest
there remains limited empirical insights on project managers ability to
leverage AI for cognitive load enhancement in complex settings. As such this
research adopts an exploratory sequential linear mixed methods approach to
address unresolved empirical issues on transient adaptations of AI in complex
projects, and the impact on cognitive load enhancement. Initial thematic
findings from semi-structured interviews with domain experts, suggest that in
order to leverage AI technologies and processes for sustainable cognitive load
enhancement with complex data over time, project managers require improved
knowledge and access to relevant technologies that mediate data processes in
complex projects, but equally reflect application across different project
phases. These initial findings support further hypothesis testing through a
larger quantitative study incorporating structural equation modelling to
examine the relationship between artificial intelligence and project managers
cognitive load with project data in complex contexts.

resources. Under the terms of a government plan to tackle climate change, a
driver for improved sustainability is the cut of greenhouse gas emissions in
the UK to almost zero by 2050. With this type of change, new themes are
continuously being developed which drive complex projects, such as the
development of new power generation methods, which encompass challenging lead
times and demanding requirements. Consideration of the implementation of
strategies and key concepts, which may engender sustainability within complex
projects therefore presents an opportunity for further critical debate, review,
and application through a project management lens. Sustainability incorporation
in project management has been documented in academic literature, with this
emerging field providing new challenges. For example, project management
education can provide a holistic base for the inculcation of sustainability
factors to a range of industries, including complex projects. Likewise,
practitioner interest and approaches to sustainability in project management
are being driven by the recently Chartered Association for Project Management
(APM). Whilst this body makes a significant contribution to the UK economy
across many sectors, it also addresses ongoing sustainability challenges.
Therefore, by drawing on research and practitioner developments, the authors
argue that by connecting with the next generation through practice simulation
approaches, and embedding sustainability issues within project management tools
and methods, improved focus on sustainability in complex project management may
be achieved.

to tagging medical notes with diagnosis codes has been shown to be effective
and crucial to the billing system in medical sector. Currently, ICD codes are
assigned to a clinical note manually which is likely to cause many errors.
Moreover, training skilled coders also requires time and human resources.
Therefore, automating the ICD code determination process is an important task.
With the advancement of artificial intelligence theory and computational
hardware, machine learning approach has emerged as a suitable solution to
automate this process. In this project, we apply a transformer-based
architecture to capture the interdependence among the tokens of a document and
then use a code-wise attention mechanism to learn code-specific representations
of the entire document. Finally, they are fed to separate dense layers for
corresponding code prediction. Furthermore, to handle the imbalance in the code
frequency of clinical datasets, we employ a label distribution aware margin
(LDAM) loss function. The experimental results on the MIMIC-III dataset show
that our proposed model outperforms other baselines by a significant margin. In
particular, our best setting achieves a micro-AUC score of 0.923 compared to
0.868 of bidirectional recurrent neural networks. We also show that by using
the code-wise attention mechanism, the model can provide more insights about
its prediction, and thus it can support clinicians to make reliable decisions.

fusion system, $f_{tb}$, is a central issue for success of fusion energy.
Reducing the tritium fraction, $f_t$, in a $DT$ burning plasma below a half
increases the burn fraction, $f_{tb}\propto1/f_t$ but also the required
confinement to achieve a burn $nT\tau_E\propto1/f_t(1-f_t)$. A doubling of the
fractional burn entails only a 4/3 enhancement of the required $nT\tau_E$. The
energy confinement time $\tau_E$ in tokamaks and stellarators is empirically
gyro-Bohm with an approximate factor of two between the best and worse results
used to construct scaling laws. Gyro-Bohm is also the approximate level of
transport needed in a power plant. What has received little study are
$\tau_t/\tau_E$, the ratio of the tritium to the energy confinement time, and
$\tau_\alpha/\tau_E$, the ratio of the alpha particle to the energy confinement
time. The tritium burn fraction is proportional to $\tau_t/\tau_E$, so the
larger the better. The contamination of the plasma by helium ash is
