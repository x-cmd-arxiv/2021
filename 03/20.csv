and its dual, which was introduced by Assmus and Key. In this paper, we develop
a method to construct linear codes with trivial hull ( LCD codes) and
one-dimensional hull by employing the positive characteristic analogues of
Gauss sums. These codes are quasi-abelian, and sometimes doubly circulant. Some
sufficient conditions for a linear code to be an LCD code (resp. a linear code
with one-dimensional hull) are presented. It is worth mentioning that we
present a lower bound on the minimum distances of the constructed linear codes.
As an application, using these conditions, we obtain some optimal or almost
optimal LCD codes (resp. linear codes with one-dimensional hull) with respect
to the online Database of Grassl.

The posterior dependence in both classes is sparse: in crossed random effects

platform for exploring the ultrafast dynamics of long-range order in solids:
Their free energy typically has multiple discrete minima, and electric laser
fields or selectively excited phonons can exert effective forces that may be
used to steer the order parameter through these free energy landscapes.
Moreover, their free energy strongly depends on fluctuations, and in some cases
restoring forces close to a minimum are exclusively of entropic origin
(order-by-disorder mechanisms). This can open pathways to control the dynamics
of the order parameter via non-thermal fluctuations. In this work, we study the
laser-induced non-equilibrium dynamics in a $120^\circ$ compass model, using
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. We analyze protocols to switch the order
parameter between equivalent configurations, with a focus on the interplay
between the external force due to the driving field, and the non-thermal
entropic forces. In particular, we find that remanent non-thermal fluctuations
after some excitation can stabilize the high-symmetry phase even when the
homogeneous potential has retrieved its low-temperature form, which facilitates
laser-induced switching.

of Covid-19 on the temporal distribution of Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
demand in Travis County, Austin, Texas and propose a robust model to forecast
Covid-19 EMS incidents. Methods: We analyzed the temporal distribution of EMS
calls in the Austin-Travis County area between January 1st, 2019, and December
31st, 2020. Change point detection was performed to identify critical dates
marking changes in EMS call distributions, and time series regression was
applied for forecasting Covid-19 EMS incidents. Results: Two critical dates
marked the impact of Covid-19 on the distribution of EMS calls: March 17th,
when the daily number of non-pandemic EMS incidents dropped significantly, and
May 13th, by which the daily number of EMS calls climbed back to 75% of the
number in pre-Covid-19 time. The new daily count of the hospitalization of
Covid-19 patients alone proves a powerful predictor of the number of pandemic
EMS calls, with an r2 value equal to 0.85. In particular, for every 2.5 cases
where EMS takes a Covid-19 patient to a hospital, one person is admitted.
Conclusion: The mean daily number of non-pandemic EMS demand was significantly
less than the period before Covid-19 pandemic. The number of EMS calls for
Covid-19 symptoms can be predicted from the daily new hospitalization of
Covid-19 patients. These findings may be of interest to EMS departments as they
plan for future pandemics, including the ability to predict pandemic-related
calls in an effort to adjust a targeted response.

alternatives to GR are usually defined through nonlinear equations, designing
new tests for these theories implies a jump in complexity and thus, a need for
refining the simulation techniques. We summarize existing techniques for

$N$-body codes for MG are usually based on standard gravity codes. We describe
the required extensions, classifying the models not according to their original

MG models usually give rise to elliptic equations, for which multigrid
techniques are well suited. Thus, we devote a large fraction of this review to

Automatization of this process is therefore of high interest. So far, the
success of computer vision approaches for sewer defect classification has been
limited when compared to the success in other fields mainly due to the lack of

defect classification called Sewer-ML.
  The Sewer-ML dataset consists of 1.3 million images annotated by professional
sewer inspectors from three different utility companies across nine years.
Together with the dataset, we also present a benchmark algorithm and a novel
metric for assessing performance. The benchmark algorithm is a result of
evaluating 12 state-of-the-art algorithms, six from the sewer defect

deployed to enhance the performances of wireless energy transfer (WET) and
wireless information transfer (WIT) by intelligently adjusting the phase shift

WPSN, we are interested in maximizing its system sum throughput to jointly
optimize the energy beamforming of the PS, the transmission time allocation, as
well as the phase shifts of the WET and WIT phases. The formulated problem is
not jointly convex due to the multiple coupled variables. To deal with its
non-convexity, we first independently find the phase shifts of the WIT phase in
closed-form. We further propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to
iteratively solve the sum throughput maximization problem. To be specific, a
semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation approach is adopted to design the
energy beamforming and the time allocation for given phase shifts of WET phase,
which is then optimized for given energy beamforming and time allocation.
Moreover, we propose an AO low-complexity scheme to significantly reduce the
computational complexity incurred by the SDP relaxation, where the optimal
closed-form energy beamforming, time allocation, and phase shifts of the WET

the practice of modeling this effect after linear superposition of single

is compared to Large-Eddy-Simulations of wind farms. We compare the models
across two different farms, composed of 9 and 49 turbines, with two different
heights of the atmospheric boundary layer, 300 and 500 m. The results show hat
the differences between the analytical models are negligible while they
substantially differ from the LES results. The linear superposition of
induction consistently underestimates the velocity deficit in front of the farm
with an error that increases as the wind farm size grows and the ABL height
decreases. Also, when calculating the power output at the turbines of the farm,
all the analytical models considered do not agree with the LES. These
comparisons reveal that the farm interactions with the atmospheric boundary

the global blockage effect. Therefore, we present a first dimensional approach

dependency is reflected in the fact that information about one random variable
provides information about the likely distribution of values of another random
variable. Insurance companies in particular must investigate such dependencies
between different lines of business and the effects that an extreme loss event,
such as an earthquake or hurricane, has across multiple lines of business
simultaneously. Copulas provide a popular model-based approach to analysing the
dependency between risks, and the coefficient of tail dependence is a measure
of dependence for extreme losses. Besides commonly used empirical estimators
for estimating the tail dependence coefficient, copula fitting can lead to
estimation of such coefficients directly or can verify their existence.
Generally, a range of copula models is available to fit a data set well,
leading to multiple different tail dependence results; a method based on
Bayesian model averaging is designed to obtain a unified estimate of tail

reducing directional persistence only outside a well-defined target zone. These

mode-coupling field theories are necessary to reproduce the correct dynamical
behaviour. Unfortunately, a theory for three coupled fields - density, velocity
and spin - has a prohibitive degree of intricacy. A simplifying path consists
in getting rid of density fluctuations by studying incompressible systems. This
requires imposing a solenoidal constraint on the primary field, an unsolved
problem even for equilibrium mode-coupling theories. Here, we perform an
equilibrium dynamic renormalization group analysis of a mode-coupling field
theory subject to a solenoidal constraint; using the classification of Halperin
and Hohenberg, we can dub this case as a solenoidal Model G. We demonstrate
that the constraint produces a new vertex that mixes static and dynamical
coupling constants, and that this vertex is essential to grant the closure of
the renormalization group structure and the consistency of dynamics with
statics. Interestingly, although the solenoidal constraint leads to a
modification of the static universality class, we find that it does not change
the dynamical universality class, a result that seems to represent an exception

static ones. Our results constitute a solid stepping stone in the admittedly

minority of researchers, receive less recognition for their work (through
citations) relative to male authors; second, authors affiliated with top-ranked
institutions, who are also a minority, receive substantially more recognition

preferences to cite authors from the same group (homophily), highly cited or

how frequently new authors join. We analyze the model and show that its

results in long-distance antagonistic interactions that drastically reduce the
speed of RNAPs and cause a quick arrest of mRNA synthesis. The mechanism
underlying this transition between cooperative and antagonistic dynamics
remains poorly understood. In this Letter, we introduce a continuum
deterministic model for the translocation of RNAPs, where the speed of an RNAP
is coupled to the local DNA supercoiling as well as the density of RNAPs on the
gene. We assume that torsional stress experienced by individual RNAPs is
exacerbated by high RNAP density on the gene and that transcription factors act
as physical barriers to the diffusion of DNA supercoils. We show that this
minimal model exhibits two transcription modes mediated by the torsional
stress: a fluid mode when the promoter is active and a torsionally stressed
mode when the promoter is repressed, in quantitative agreement with
experimentally observed dynamics of co-transcribing RNAPs. Our work provides an
important step towards understanding the collective dynamics of molecular

star formation rate (sSFR) and a tracer of episodic star-formation activity.
Previous assessments show that EW strongly anti-correlates with stellar mass as
$M^{-0.25}$ similar to the sSFR -- stellar mass relation. However, such a
correlation may be driven/formed by selection effects. In this study, we
investigate how H$\alpha$ EWs correlate with galaxy properties and how
selection biases could alter such correlations using a $z = 0.47$
narrowband-selected sample of 1572 H$\alpha$ emitters from the Ly$\alpha$
Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (LAGER) survey. The sample covers 3
deg$^2$ of COSMOS and $1.1\times10^5$ cMpc$^3$. We assume an intrinsic EW
distribution to form mock samples of H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) and propagate
the selection criteria to match observations, giving us control on how
selection biases can affect the underlying results. We find EW intrinsically
correlates with stellar mass as $W_0 \propto M^{-0.16\pm0.03}$ and decreases by
a factor of $\sim 3$ from $10^{7}$ to $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. We find low-mass
HAEs to be $\sim 320$ times more likely to have rest-frame EW$ > 200$\AA
compared to high-mass HAEs. Combining the intrinsic EW -- stellar mass
correlation with an observed SMF correctly reproduces the observed H$\alpha$
LF, while not correcting for selection effects underestimates the number of
bright HAEs. This suggests that the intrinsic EW -- stellar mass correlation is
physically significant and reproduces three statistical distributions of galaxy
populations (LF, SMF, EW distribution). At lower masses, we find there are more
high-EW outliers compared to high masses, even after taking into account
selection effects. Our results suggest that high sSFR outliers indicative of
bursty SF activity are intrinsically more prevalent in low-mass HAEs and not a

downsizing, we show that downward-concave CMDFs (associated with systems with
extremely small infall timescales and with very strong winds) are more frequent
in low-mass galaxies, which include larger fractions of young systems and
present more substantial deviations from equilibrium between gas accretion and
reprocessing (either via star formation or winds).

the predicted dark matter halo mass function is generally explained primarily
by feedback processes. Feedback can shape the stellar-halo mass (SHM) relation
by driving gas out of galaxies, by modulating the first-time infall of gas onto
galaxies (i.e., preventative feedback), and by instigating fountain flows of
recycled wind material. We present and apply a method to disentangle these
effects for hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. We build a model of
linear coupled differential equations that by construction reproduces the flows
of gas onto and out of galaxies and haloes in the EAGLE cosmological
simulation. By varying individual terms in this model, we isolate the relative
effects of star formation, ejection via outflow, first-time inflow and wind
recycling on the SHM relation. We find that for halo masses $M_{200} < 10^{12}
\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ the SHM relation is shaped primarily by a combination of
ejection from galaxies and haloes, while for larger $M_{200}$ preventative
feedback is also important. The effects of recycling and the efficiency of star
formation are small. We show that if, instead of $M_{200}$, we use the
cumulative mass of dark matter that fell in for the first time, the evolution
of the SHM relation nearly vanishes. This suggests that the evolution is due to
the definition of halo mass rather than to an evolving physical efficiency of
galaxy formation. Finally, we demonstrate that the mass in the circum-galactic
medium is much more sensitive to gas flows, especially recycling, than is the
case for stars and the interstellar medium.

ionization model for the IM Lup protoplanetary disk. Incorporating ionization
from multiple internal and external sources, we model N$_2$H$^+$ and
H$^{13}$CO$^+$ abundances under varying ionization environments, and compare
these directly to the imaged ALMA observations by performing non-LTE radiative
transfer, visibility sampling, and imaging. We find that the observations are
best reproduced using a radially increasing cosmic ray (CR) gradient, with low
CR ionization in the inner disk, high CR ionization in the outer disk, and a
transition at $\sim 80 - 100$ au. This location is approximately coincident
with the edge of spiral structure identified in millimeter emission. We also
find that IM Lup shows evidence for enhanced UV-driven formation of HCO$^+$,
which we attribute to the disk's high flaring angle. In summary, IM Lup
represents the first protoplanetary disk with observational evidence for a CR
gradient, which may have important implications for IM Lup's on-going

to their demonstrated capability to approximate nonlinear operators between
infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. However, despite their remarkable early
promise, they typically require large training data-sets consisting of paired
input-output observations which may be expensive to obtain, while their
predictions may not be consistent with the underlying physical principles that
generated the observed data. In this work, we propose a novel model class
coined as physics-informed DeepONets, which introduces an effective
regularization mechanism for biasing the outputs of DeepOnet models towards
ensuring physical consistency. This is accomplished by leveraging automatic
differentiation to impose the underlying physical laws via soft penalty
constraints during model training. We demonstrate that this simple, yet
remarkably effective extension can not only yield a significant improvement in
the predictive accuracy of DeepOnets, but also greatly reduce the need for
large training data-sets. To this end, a remarkable observation is that
physics-informed DeepONets are capable of solving parametric partial
differential equations (PDEs) without any paired input-output observations,
except for a set of given initial or boundary conditions. We illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework through a series of comprehensive
numerical studies across various types of PDEs. Strikingly, a trained physics
informed DeepOnet model can predict the solution of $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$
time-dependent PDEs in a fraction of a second -- up to three orders of
magnitude faster compared a conventional PDE solver. The data and code

  Informed by the properties of formal solutions to the Poisson equation, we
test the performance of different neural networks. Our key takeaway is that
networks which are capable of learning non-local relationships perform well,
without needing to be scaled with the input problem size, making them good
candidates for the extremely large problems encountered in high-performance

exponentially with the population size. When members of each species migrate
into the population at rate $\lambda$ and replace a randomly selected

reaches a steady state, but the steady-state population distribution undergoes
a unimodal to trimodal transition as the migration rate decreases below a
critical value $\lambda_c$. In the low-migration regime, $\lambda<\lambda_c$,
the steady state is not truly steady, but instead strongly fluctuates between
near-fixation states, where the population consists of mostly A's or of mostly

classification. However, high classification performances of DNNs are related
to their large training sets. Unfortunately, in the literature, the datasets
used to classify motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain
a small number of samples. To achieve high performances with small-sized
datasets, most of the studies have employed a transformation such as common
spatial patterns (CSP) before the classification process. However, CSP is
dependent on subjects and introduces computational load in real-time
applications. It is observed in the literature that the augmentation process is
not applied for increasing the classification performance of EEG signals. In
this study, we have investigated the effect of the augmentation process on the
classification performance of MI EEG signals instead of using a preceding
transformation such as the CSP, and we have demonstrated that by resulting in
high success rates for the classification of MI EEGs, the augmentation process
is able to compete with the CSP. In addition to the augmentation process, we
modified the DNN structure to increase the classification performance, to
decrease the number of nodes in the structure, and to be used with less number
of hyper parameters. A minimum distance network (MDN) following the last layer
of the convolutional neural network (CNN) was used as the classifier instead of
a fully connected neural network (FCNN). By augmenting the EEG dataset and
focusing solely on CNN's training, the training algorithm of the proposed

COVID-19 pandemic. Existing research shows that COVID-19 discourse is highly
politicized, with political preferences linked to beliefs and disbeliefs about
the virus. As it happens with topics that become politicized, people may fall
into echo chambers, which is the idea that one is only presented with
information they already agree with, thereby reinforcing one's confirmation
bias. Understanding the relationship between information dissemination and
political preference is crucial for effective public health communication.
  Objective: We aimed to study the extent of polarization and examine the
structure of echo chambers related to COVID-19 discourse on Twitter in the
United States.
  Methods: First, we presented Retweet-BERT, a scalable and highly accurate
model for estimating user polarity by leveraging language features and network
structures. Then, by analyzing the user polarity predicted by Retweet-BERT, we
provided new insights into the characterization of partisan users.
  Results: We observed that right-leaning users were noticeably more vocal and
active in the production and consumption of COVID-19 information. We also found
that most of the highly influential users were partisan, which may contribute
to further polarization. Importantly, while echo chambers exist in both the
right- and left-leaning communities, the right-leaning community was by far
more densely connected within their echo chamber and isolated from the rest.
  Conclusions: We provided empirical evidence that political echo chambers are
prevalent, especially in the right-leaning community, which can exacerbate the
exposure to information in line with pre-existing users' views. Our findings
have broader implications in developing effective public health campaigns and
promoting the circulation of factual information online.

the cross-entropy loss that has a uniform prior asserted on the predicted
labels. In our theoretical analysis, we prove that degenerate solutions are not
in the set of optimal solutions of our approach. Self-Classifier is simple to
implement and scalable. Unlike other popular unsupervised classification and
contrastive representation learning approaches, it does not require any form of
pre-training, expectation-maximization, pseudo-labeling, external clustering, a
second network, stop-gradient operation, or negative pairs. Despite its
simplicity, our approach sets a new state of the art for unsupervised
classification of ImageNet; and even achieves comparable to state-of-the-art
results for unsupervised representation learning. Code is available at

quantum information theory. These so-called statistical strategies come in a
commuting type and a more specific spatial type, which are respectively special
cases of the quantum commuting and quantum spatial strategies commonly
considered in the field. We prove a theorem that the sets of statistical
commuting strategies and statistical spatial strategies are respectively equal
to the sets of quantum commuting strategies and quantum spatial strategies for
any nonlocal game. Thus we are able to use the recent negative solution of
Tsirelson's problem to obtain a statistical analog showing that there exists a
nonlocal game where the set of statistical commuting strategies properly
contains the closure of the set of statistical spatial strategies. The proof of
this theorem involves development of statistical replicas for numerous
constructions in quantum information theory, in particular for the Fourier-type
duality between observation structures and dynamical structures. The main point
of the argument is to apply the established theory of approximating unitary
representations of countable discrete groups by ergodic measure preserving
actions of such groups. We note that the relevant groups are nonamenable. We
also give an explicit description of a statistical strategy to win the CHSH
game from Aspect's experiment with a probability exceeding the maximum possible
value for a classical strategy.

takes a point cloud of an arbitrary object as an input, and then, generates
orthographic views of the given object. The obtained views are finally used to
estimate pixel-wise grasp synthesis for each object. We train the model
end-to-end using a small object grasp dataset and test it on both simulations

performance of the proposed approach, we performed extensive sets of

pre-main sequence evolution to the star formation histories of young clusters

on lithium, beryllium, and boron and on carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. LiBeB are
rare elements, with negligible abundances with respect to hydrogen; on the
contrary, CNO are among the most abundant elements in the Universe. Pioneering
observations of light-element surface abundances in stars started almost 70
years ago and huge progress has been achieved since then. Indeed, for different
reasons, precise measurements of LiBeB and CNO are difficult, even in our Sun;
however, the advent of state-of-the-art ground- and space-based instrumentation
has allowed the determination of high-quality abundances in stars of different
type, belonging to different Galactic populations. Noticeably, the recent large
spectroscopic surveys performed with multifiber spectrographs have yielded
detailed and homogeneous information on the abundances of Li and CNO for
statistically significant samples of stars; this has allowed us to obtain new
results and insights and, at the same time, raise new questions and challenges.
A complete understanding of the light-element patterns and evolution in the
Universe has not been still achieved. Perspectives for further progress will
open up soon thanks to the new generation instrumentation that is under
development and will come online in the coming years.

a deep neural network capable of captioning cardiac signals; it receives a

this further to generate multilingual reports. To that end, we create and make

demonstrate that multilingual models can outperform their monolingual

Even companies and tech savvy people must use extensive resources to maintain
backups for recovery or else they will lose valuable data, not mentioning
average users. Unfortunately, not any recovery tool can effectively defend
various types of ransomware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
ransomware defense mechanism that can be easily deployed in modern Windows
system to recover the data and mitigate a ransomware attack. The uniqueness of
our approach is to fight the virus like a virus. We leverage Alternative Data
Streams which are sometimes used by malicious applications, to develop a data
protection method that misleads the ransomware to attack only file 'shells'
instead of the actual file content. We evaluated different file encrypting
ransomware and demonstrate usability, efficiency and effectiveness of our
approach.

In certain safety-critical robotics applications, especially autonomous

monocular video sequences in autonomous driving to account for unknown objects.
Video class agnostic segmentation can be formulated as an open-set or a motion

benchmark different baseline approaches for both tracks. In the
motion-segmentation track we benchmark real-time joint panoptic and motion
instance segmentation, and evaluate the effect of ego-flow suppression. In the
open-set segmentation track we evaluate baseline methods that combine
appearance, and geometry to learn prototypes per semantic class. We then

for data association. In order to tackle tracking discontinuities, we
incorporate a local search and matching module into the inference head layer
that exploits SiamFC for short term tracking. Moreover, in order to improve
robustness to scale changes, we introduce a scale adaptive region proposal

domain. This leads to a GSP theory that starts from the spectral domain, for
example, linear shift invariant (LSI) filtering in the spectral domain is with
polynomials $P(M)$. We then develop GSP vertex and spectral domain dual

decimation, upsampling, and interpolation. We show how GSP sampling reduces to
DSP sampling when the graph is the directed time cycle graph. Simple examples
illustrate the impact of choices that are available in GSP sampling.

wide range of behaviors in the devices' resource demand that are extremely

this paper, we develop a novel data-driven resource management framework named
BEHAVE that intelligently and fairly allocates edge resources to heterogeneous

BEHAVE aims to holistically address the management technical barriers by: 1)
building an efficient scheme for modeling and assessment of the BRD of IoT
devices based on their resource requests and resource usage; 2) expanding a new
Rational, Fair, and Truthful Resource Allocation (RFTA) model that binds the
devices' BRD and resource allocation to achieve fair allocation and encourage
truthfulness in resource demand; and 3) developing an enhanced deep

DEBCat, an updated catalogue of eclipsing binary observations such as mass,
radius, luminosity, effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity. We used
the {PARAM web interface for the Bayesian estimation of stellar parameters,
along with} the stellar evolutionary code MESA to estimate the binary age,
assuming a coeval hypothesis for both members. We derived the mass and
radius-luminosity-metallicity-age relations using 56 stars, {with metallicity
and mass in the range -0.34<[Fe/H]<0.27 and 0.66<M/M{_\odot}<1.8}. With that,
the observed mass and radius are reproduced with an accuracy of 3.5% and 5.9%,
respectively, which is consistent with the other results in literature. We
conclude that including the age in such relations increases the quality of the
fit, particularly in terms of the mass, as compared to the radius. On the other
hand, as other authors have noted, we observed an higher dispersion on the mass
relation than in that of the radius. We propose that this is due to a stellar

strictly larger than that of relevant codes with known explicit decoding
algorithms. Motivated by this finding, we then develop an efficient decoding

error correction not only enables the usage of hierarchical codes in
computational storage at the edge, but also applies to any Cauchy-like codes

method. The proposed procedure is based on domain decomposition and combines
the Multiscale Perturbation Method (MPM) with the Multiscale Robin Coupled
Method (MRCM). When an update of the velocity field is called by the operator
splitting algorithm, the MPM-2P may provide, depending on the magnitude of a
dimensionless algorithmic parameter, an accurate and computationally
inexpensive approximation for the velocity field by reusing previously computed
multiscale basis functions. Thus, a full update of all multiscale basis
functions required by the MRCM for the construction of a new velocity field is
avoided. There are two main steps in the formulation of the MPM-2P. Initially,
for each subdomain one local boundary value problem with trivial Robin boundary
conditions is solved (instead of a full set of multiscale basis functions, that
would be required by the MRCM). Then, the solution of an inexpensive interface
problem provides the velocity field on the skeleton of the decomposition of the
domain. The resulting approximation for the velocity field is obtained by
downscaling. We consider challenging two-phase flow problems, with
high-contrast permeability fields and water-oil finger growth in homogeneous
media. Our numerical experiments show that the use of the MPM-2P gives
exceptional speed-up - almost 90% of reduction in computational cost - of
two-phase flow simulations. Hundreds of MRCM solutions can be replaced by
inexpensive MPM-2P solutions, and water breakthrough can be simulated with very
few updates of the MRCM set of multiscale basis functions.

online learning, respectively. We provide a learning convergence analysis that
yields a finite mistake bound on the number of times performance requirements
are not met and can provide strong safety guarantees, by bounding the
worst-case state deviation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
approach for online robust control of nonlinear systems with such learning
theoretic and safety guarantees. We also show how to instantiate this framework
for general robotic systems, demonstrating the practicality of our approach.

shift between the source domain used for training and the target domain where
testing takes place. However, current DA methods assume that the entire target
domain is available during adaptation, which may not hold in practice. This
paper considers a more realistic scenario, where target data become available
in smaller batches and adaptation on the entire target domain is not feasible.
In our work, we introduce a new, data-constrained DA paradigm where unlabeled
target samples are received in batches and adaptation is performed continually.
We propose a novel source-free method for continual unsupervised domain
adaptation that utilizes a buffer for selective replay of previously seen
samples. In our continual DA framework, we selectively mix samples from
incoming batches with data stored in a buffer using buffer management
strategies and use the combination to incrementally update our model. We
evaluate the classification performance of the continual DA approach with
state-of-the-art DA methods based on the entire target domain. Our results on
three popular DA datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms many existing
state-of-the-art DA methods with access to the entire target domain during
adaptation.

modulation of oxidative stress. Moreover, it has been observed that lithium's
effects are isotope-dependent. Based on these findings, here we propose that
lithium exerts its effects by influencing the recombination dynamics of a
naturally occurring radical pair involving oxygen. We develop a simple model
inspired by the radical-pair mechanism in cryptochrome in the context of avian
magnetoreception and xenon-induced anesthesia. Our model reproduces the
observed isotopic dependence in the lithium treatment of hyperactivity in rats.
It predicts a magnetic-field dependence of the effectiveness of lithium, which
provides one potential experimental test of our hypothesis. Our findings show
that Nature might harness quantum entanglement for the brain's cognitive
processes.

by the LHCb experiment corresponding to either 9 fb$^{-1}$ or 6 fb$^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity. The $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ mesons are reconstructed using
the $e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$ final state, which can proceed as three-body decays
$\pi^{0}\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$ and $\eta \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$,
or via the two-body decays $\pi^{0}\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and
$\eta\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ followed by a photon conversion. The measurements
are made relative to the control modes $D_{(s)}^{+}\rightarrow K_{S}^{0} h^{+}$

(0.9 \pm 3.7 \pm 1.1 )\%, \end{align} where the first uncertainties are

sides of the face. Physicians currently assess facial asymmetry in a subjective
manner based on their clinical experience. This paper proposes a novel method
to provide an objective and quantitative asymmetry score for frontal faces. Our
metric has the potential to help physicians for diagnosis as well as monitoring
the rehabilitation of patients with one-sided facial paralysis. A deep learning
based landmark detection technique is used to estimate style invariant facial
landmark points and dense optical flow is used to generate motion maps from a
short sequence of frames. Six face regions are considered corresponding to the
left and right parts of the forehead, eyes, and mouth. Motion is computed and
compared between the left and the right parts of each region of interest to
estimate the symmetry score. For testing, asymmetric sequences are
synthetically generated from a facial expression dataset. A score equation is
developed to quantify symmetry in both symmetric and asymmetric face sequences.

integrators of mechanical systems subject to external forcing. Essentially, we
prove that when a discretization of contact order $r$ of the Lagrangian and
force are used, the integrator has the same contact order. Our analysis is
performed first for discrete forced mechanical systems defined over $TQ$, where
we study the existence of flows, the construction and properties of discrete
exact systems and the contact order of the flows (variational integrators) in
terms of the contact order of the original systems. Then we use those results
to derive the corresponding analysis for the analogous forced systems defined
over $Q\times Q$.

weak light-matter interactions due to their atomically thin form factor.
Resonant nanophotonic structures provide a viable way to address this issue and
enhance light-matter interactions in 2D TMDCs. Here, we provide an overview of
this research area, showcasing relevant applications, including exotic light
emission, absorption and scattering features. We start by overviewing the
concept of excitons in 1L-TMDC and the fundamental theory of cavity-enhanced
emission, followed by a discussion on the recent progress of enhanced light
emission, strong coupling and valleytronics. The atomically thin nature of
1L-TMDC enables a broad range of ways to tune its electric and optical
properties. Thus, we continue by reviewing advances in TMDC-based tunable
photonic devices. Next, we survey the recent progress in enhanced light
absorption over narrow and broad bandwidths using 1L or few-layer TMDCs, and
their applications for photovoltaics and photodetectors. We also review recent
efforts of engineering light scattering, e.g., inducing Fano resonances,
wavefront engineering in 1L or few-layer TMDCs by either integrating resonant
structures, such as plasmonic/Mie resonant metasurfaces, or directly patterning
monolayer/few layers TMDCs. We then overview the intriguing physical properties

of deep learning based algorithms to automatically detect and classify point
sources from gamma-ray data. For concreteness we refer to this approach as
AutoSourceID. To detect point sources, we utilized U-shaped convolutional
networks for image segmentation and {\it k}-means for source clustering and
localization. We also explored the Centroid-Net algorithm, which is designed to
find and count objects. The training data are based on 9.5 years of exposure
from The Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and we used source properties
of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and pulsars (PSRs) from the fourth Fermi-LAT
source catalog (4FGL) in addition to several models of background interstellar
emission. The results of the localization algorithm are fed into a
classification neural network that is trained to separate the three general
source classes (AGNs, PSRs, and FAKE sources).
  We compared our localization algorithms qualitatively with traditional
methods and find them to have similar detection thresholds. We also demonstrate
the robustness of our source localization algorithms to modifications in the
interstellar emission models, which presents a clear advantage over traditional
methods. The classification network is able to discriminate between the three
classes with typical accuracy of $\sim$ 70%, as long as balanced data sets are
used in classification training. In https://github.com/bapanes/AutoSourceID, we
publish our training data sets and analysis scripts and invite the community to
join the data challenge aimed to improve the localization and classification of
gamma-ray point sources.

by neural networks (NNs) has been popular in the past a few years. However,
different types of loss functions can be proposed for the same PDE. For the
Poisson equation, the loss function can be based on the weak formulation of
energy variation or the least squares method, which leads to the deep Ritz
model and deep Galerkin model, respectively. But loss landscapes from these
different models give arise to different practical performance of training the
NN parameters. To investigate and understand such practical differences, we
propose to compare the loss landscapes of these models, which are both high
dimensional and highly non-convex. In such settings, the roughness is more
important than the traditional eigenvalue analysis to describe the
non-convexity. We contribute to the landscape comparisons by proposing a
roughness index to scientifically and quantitatively describe the heuristic
concept of ""roughness"" of landscape around minimizers. This index is based on
random projections and the variance of (normalized) total variation for one
dimensional projected functions, and it is efficient to compute. A large
roughness index hints an oscillatory landscape profile as a severe challenge
for the first order optimization method. We apply this index to the two models
for the Poisson equation and our empirical results reveal a consistent general
observation that the landscapes from the deep Galerkin method around its local
minimizers are less rough than the deep Ritz method, which supports the
observed gain in accuracy of the deep Galerkin method.

Next we solve the resource contention issues between transactional and
analytical queries. We propose a global deadlock detector to increase the
concurrency of query processing. When transactions that update data are
guaranteed to reside on exactly one segment we introduce one-phase commit to
speed up query processing. Our resource group model introduces the capability
to separate OLAP and OLTP workloads into more suitable query processing mode.
Our experimental evaluation on the TPC-B and CH-benCHmark benchmarks
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in boosting the OLTP performance
without sacrificing the OLAP performance.

following schemes, motivated by the recent interest in CAV platooning

developed for CAV platooning. However, most existing distributed schemes for
platoon centered CAV control require either centralized data processing or
centralized computation in at least one step of their schemes, referred to as
partially distributed schemes. In this paper, we develop fully distributed
optimization based, platoon centered CAV platooning control under the linear
vehicle dynamics via the model predictive control approach with a general
prediction horizon. These fully distributed schemes do not require centralized
data processing or centralized computation through the entire schemes. To
develop these schemes, we propose a new formulation of the objective function
and a decomposition method that decomposes a densely coupled central objective
function into the sum of several locally coupled functions whose coupling
satisfies the network topology constraint. We then exploit the formulation of
locally coupled optimization and operator splitting methods to develop fully
distributed schemes. Control design and stability analysis is carried out to
achieve desired traffic transient performance and asymptotic stability.
Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fully distributed

point set registration. This method is originally designed for pair-wise
registration and it will suffer from great challenges when applied to
multi-view registration. Under the NDT framework, this paper proposes a novel
multi-view registration method, named 3D multi-view registration based on the
normal distributions transform (3DMNDT), which integrates the K-means
clustering and Lie algebra solver to achieve multi-view registration. More
specifically, the multi-view registration is cast into the problem of maximum
likelihood estimation. Then, the K-means algorithm is utilized to divide all
data points into different clusters, where a normal distribution is computed to
locally models the probability of measuring a data point in each cluster.
Subsequently, the registration problem is formulated by the NDT-based
likelihood function. To maximize this likelihood function, the Lie algebra
solver is developed to sequentially optimize each rigid transformation. The
proposed method alternately implements data point clustering, NDT computing,
and likelihood maximization until desired registration results are obtained.
Experimental results tested on benchmark data sets illustrate that the proposed
method can achieve state-of-the-art performance for multi-view registration.

observed spectra, and are adopted in nearly all of the GRB literature. Here, we
reanalyze the sample defined in Li.et al.,2021,ApJS,254,35 (39 bursts including

corner-corner plots of the posteriors to determine well-constrained $\beta$

defining the four groups by difference of the deviance information criterion
(DIC). We find inconsistent peaks of the parameter distributions between the

preferred model (BAND). This means that if a spectrum is statistically
preferred, described as the BAND, applying COMP to derive the spectral
parameters will prominently deviate from their intrinsic shape, therefore
affecting the physical interpretation. Our analysis indicates that the better

the capabilities of capturing the temporal relevance between users. Moreover,
effective user matching by fusing different views, i.e., social, spatial, and

learns a view-specific representation for matching, and MVMN fuses them for

to systematically control their performance to conserve the energy. Through
this protocol, sensor nodes autonomously activate an additional energy
conservation algorithm. ASMP embeds three sampling algorithms. For the
optimized environment sampling, we proposed the adaptive sampling algorithm for
monitoring (ASA-m). ASA-m estimates the expected time period to occur
meaningful change. The meaningful change refers to the distance between two
target data for the monitoring QoS. Therefore, ASA-m merely gathers the data
the system demands. The continuous adaptive sampling algorithm (CASA) solves
the problem to be continuously decreasing energy despite of ASA-m. When the
monitored environment shows a linear trend property, the sensor node in CASA
rests a sampling process, and the server generates predicted data at the
estimated time slot. For guaranteeing the self-sustainability, ASMP uses the
recoverable adaptive sampling algorithm (RASA). RASA makes consumed energy
smaller than harvested energy by utilizing the predicted data. RASA recharges
the energy of the sensor node. Through this method, ASMP achieves both energy

report their research findings. The transformation of print journals into
e-journals has simplified the process of submissions to journals and also their
access has become wider. Journals are usually published by commercial
publishers, learned societies as well as Universities. There are different
number of journals published from different countries. This paper attempts to
explore whether the number of journals published from a country influences its
research output. Scopus master journal list is analysed to identify journals
published from 50 selected countries with significant volume of research
output. The following relationship are analysed: (a) number of journals from a
country and its research output, (b) growth rate of journals and research
output for different countries, (c) global share of journals and research
output for different countries, and (d) subject area-wise number of journals
and research output in that subject area for different countries. Factors like
journal packing density are also analysed. The results obtained show that for
majority of the countries, the number of journals is positively correlated to
their research output volume, though some other factors also play a role in
growth of research output. The study at the end presents a discussion of the
analytical outcomes and provides useful suggestions on policy perspectives for
different countries.

which offer many prospects in optoelectronics. A monolayer of molybdenum
disulfide (MoS2) has a direct bandgap of 1.88 eV. Hence, when excited with
optical photon energies below its bandgap, no photocarriers are generated and a
monolayer of MoS2 is not of much use in either photovoltaics or photodetection.
Here, we demonstrate that large size MoS2 monolayer sandwiched between two
graphene layers makes this heterostructure optically active well below the band
gap of MoS2. An ultrafast optical pump-THz probe experiment reveals in
real-time, transfer of carriers between graphene and MoS2 monolayer upon
photoexcitation with photon energies down to 0.5 eV. It also helps to unravel
an unprecedented enhancement in the broadband transient THz response of this
tri-layer material system. We propose possible mechanism which can account for
this phenomenon. Such specially designed heterostructures, which can be easily
built around different transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, will
considerably broaden the scope for modern optoelectronic applications at THz
bandwidth.

an $O(T^{3/4})$ regret bound for convex losses, where $T$ is the number of
total rounds. However, it requires $T$ communication rounds, and cannot utilize
the strong convexity of losses. In this paper, we propose an improved variant
of D-OCG, namely D-BOCG, which can attain the same $O(T^{3/4})$ regret bound
with only $O(\sqrt{T})$ communication rounds for convex losses, and a better
regret bound of $O(T^{2/3}(\log T)^{1/3})$ with fewer $O(T^{1/3}(\log

adopt a delayed update mechanism that reduces the communication complexity, and
redefine the surrogate loss function in D-OCG for exploiting the strong
convexity. Furthermore, we provide lower bounds to demonstrate that the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ communication rounds required by D-BOCG are optimal (in terms of
$T$) for achieving the $O(T^{3/4})$ regret with convex losses, and the
$O(T^{1/3}(\log T)^{2/3})$ communication rounds required by D-BOCG are
near-optimal (in terms of $T$) for achieving the $O(T^{2/3}(\log T)^{1/3})$
regret with strongly convex losses up to polylogarithmic factors. Finally, to
handle the more challenging bandit setting, in which only the loss value is
available, we incorporate the classical one-point gradient estimator into
D-BOCG, and obtain similar theoretical guarantees.

daily life. Biometric-based (especially activity-based) approaches are favored
due to their fidelity, universality, and resilience. However, most existing
machine learning-based approaches rely on a traditional workflow where models
are usually trained once for all, with limited involvement from end-users in
the process and neglecting the dynamic nature of the learning process. This
makes the models static and can not be updated in time, which usually leads to
high false positive or false negative. Thus, in practice, an expert is desired
to assist with providing high-quality observations and interpretation of model
outputs. It is expedient to combine both advantages of human experts and the
computational capability of computers to create a tight-coupling incremental
learning process for better performance. In this study, we develop RLTIR, an
interactive identity recognition approach based on reinforcement learning, to
adjust the identification model by human guidance. We first build a base
tree-structured identity recognition model. And an expert is introduced in the
model for giving feedback upon model outputs. Then, the model is updated
according to strategies that are automatically learned under a designated
reinforcement learning framework. To the best of our knowledge, it is the very
first attempt to combine human expert knowledge with model learning in the area

reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided wideband millimeter wave
(mmWave) communications. Due to the intrinsic passive property, the phase
shifts of all elements in RIS should be the same for all frequencies. However,
in the wideband scenario, beam squint induced distinct path phases require
designing different phase shifts for different frequencies. The above
irreconcilable contradiction will dramatically affect the system performance,
considering the RIS usually consists of enormous elements and the bandwidth of
wideband mmWave communications may be up to several GHz. Therefore, we propose
some novel phase shift design schemes for mitigating the effect of beam squint
for both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-Los (NLoS) scenarios. Specifically, for
the LoS scenario, we firstly derive the optimal phase shift for each frequency
and obtain the common phase shift by maximizing the upper bound of achievable
rate. Then, for the NLoS scenario, a mean channel covariance matrix (MCCM)
based scheme is proposed by fully exploiting the correlations between both the
paths and the subcarriers. Our extensive numerical experiments confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed phase shift design schemes.

occurrence. When it does occur, it is vital that the dose received by the
developing embryo or foetus is understood as fully as possible. This study
presents the first investigation of foetal doses delivered during helical
tomotherapy treatments.
  Materials & Methods: Six treatment plans were delivered to an anthropomorphic
phantom using a tomotherapy machine. These included treatments of the brain,
unilateral and bilateral head-and-neck, chest wall, and upper lung.
Measurements of foetal dose were made with an ionisation chamber positioned at
various locations longitudinally within the phantom to simulate a variety of
patient anatomies.
  Results: All measurements were below the established limit of 100 mGy for a
high risk of damage during the first trimester. The largest dose encountered
was 75 mGy (0.125% of prescription dose). The majority of treatments with
measurement positions less than 30 cm fell into the range of uncertain risk (50
- 100 mGy). All treatments with measurement positions beyond 30 cm fell into
the low risk category (< 50 mGy).
  Conclusions: For the cases in this study, tomotherapy resulted in foetal
doses that are at least on par with, if not significantly lower than, similar
3D conformal or intensity-modulated treatments delivered with other devices.
Recommendations were also provided for estimating foetal doses from tomotherapy
plans.

$(1+\epsilon)$ approximation to the best $k$-dimensional subspace that
minimizes the sum of $p$-th powers of distances of all the points to this

iterations with multiple passes over the data. Matrix sketching techniques give
a single-pass $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation for $\ell_{p}$ subspace
approximation but require additional passes for subset selection.
  In this work, we propose an MCMC algorithm to reduce the number of passes
required by previous subset selection algorithms based on adaptive sampling.
For $p=2$, our algorithm gives subset selection of nearly optimal size in only
$2$ passes, whereas the number of passes required in previous work depend on
$k$. Our algorithm picks a subset of size $\mathrm{poly}(k/\epsilon)$ that
gives $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation to the optimal subspace. The running time of
the algorithm is $nd + d~\mathrm{poly}(k/\epsilon)$. We extend our results to
the case when outliers are present in the datasets, and suggest a two pass

logical gate implementation -- their geometric nature guarantees their
invariance under reparametrizations of the associated cyclic path in parameter

e.g., noise. The first question that we tackle in this work is how to quantify
in a meaningful way this effect of noise, focusing, for concreteness, on the
nuclear quadrupole resonance hamiltonian -- other systems of this nature can
clearly be treated analogously. We consider a precessing magnetic field that
drives adiabatically a degenerate doublet, and is subjected to noise, the
effects of which on the Wilczek-Zee holonomy are computed analytically. A
critical review of previous related works reveals a series of assumptions, like
sudden jumps in the field, or the presence of white noise, that might violate
adiabaticity. We propose a state-independent measure of the effect, and then
consider sinusoidal noise in the field, of random amplitude and phase. We find
that all integer noise frequencies $m \neq 2$ behave similarly, in a manner
reminiscent of the abelian case, but that noise of frequency $m = 2$ has a very
different, and, at the same time, very pronounced effect, that might well

privacy-preserving generative model DATALENS. Comparing with the standard PATE
privacy-preserving framework which allows teachers to vote on one-dimensional
predictions, voting on the high dimensional gradient vectors is challenging in
terms of privacy preservation. As dimension reduction techniques are required,
we need to navigate a delicate tradeoff space between (1) the improvement of
privacy preservation and (2) the slowdown of SGD convergence. To tackle this,
we take advantage of communication efficient learning and propose a novel noise

the practical usage of DATALENS, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and high dimensional CelebA, and we
show that, DATALENS significantly outperforms other baseline DP generative
models. In addition, we adapt the proposed TOPAGG approach, which is one of the
key building blocks in DATALENS, to DP SGD training, and show that it is able

is a fundamental topic in computer vision owing to its growing importance in
robot vision and autonomous driving industries. It provides rich information
about objects in the scene such as object boundary, category, and location.
Recent methods for semantic segmentation often employ an encoder-decoder
structure using deep convolutional neural networks. The encoder part extracts
feature of the image using several filters and pooling operations, whereas the
decoder part gradually recovers the low-resolution feature maps of the encoder
into a full input resolution feature map for pixel-wise prediction. However,
the encoder-decoder variants for semantic segmentation suffer from severe
spatial information loss, caused by pooling operations or convolutions with
stride, and does not consider the context in the scene. In this paper, we
propose a dense upsampling convolution method based on guided filtering to
effectively preserve the spatial information of the image in the network. We
further propose a novel local context convolution method that not only covers
larger-scale objects in the scene but covers them densely for precise object
boundary delineation. Theoretical analyses and experimental results on several
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. Qualitatively, our
approach delineates object boundaries at a level of accuracy that is beyond the
current excellent methods. Quantitatively, we report a new record of 82.86% and
81.62% of pixel accuracy on ADE20K and Pascal-Context benchmark datasets,
respectively. In comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed
method offers promising improvements.

descriptions about their expected appearance when observed (class embeddings)

accessible. We tackle ZSL by casting a ""vanilla"" convolutional neural network
(e.g. AlexNet, ResNet-101, DenseNet-201 or DarkNet-53) into a zero-shot
learner. We do so by crafting the softmax classifier: we freeze its weights
using fixed seen classification rules, either semantic (seen class embeddings)
or visual (seen class prototypes). Then, we learn a data-driven and
ZSL-tailored feature representation on seen classes only to match these fixed
classification rules. Given that the latter seamlessly generalize towards
unseen classes, while requiring not actual unseen data to be computed, we can
perform ZSL inference by augmenting the pool of classification rules at test
time while keeping the very same representation we learnt: nowhere re-training
or fine-tuning on unseen data is performed. The combination of semantic and
visual crafting (by simply averaging softmax scores) improves prior
state-of-the-art methods in benchmark datasets for standard, inductive ZSL.
After rebalancing predictions to better handle the joint inference over seen

well. Also, we gain interpretability at no additional cost, by using neural
attention methods (e.g., grad-CAM) as they are. Code will be made publicly

code development and maintenance. The majority of recent research suggest
method names based on the text summarization approach. They take the token
sequence and abstract syntax tree of the source code as input, and generate
method names through a powerful neural network based model. However, the tokens
composing the method name are closely related to the entity name within its
method implementation. Actually, high proportions of the tokens in method name
can be found in its corresponding method implementation, which makes it
possible for incorporating these common shared token information to improve the
performance of method naming task. Inspired by this key observation, we propose
a two-stage keywords guided method name generation approach to suggest method
names. Specifically, we decompose the method naming task into two subtasks,
including keywords extraction task and method name generation task. For the
keywords extraction task, we apply a graph neural network based model to
extract the keywords from source code. For the method name generation task, we
utilize the extracted keywords to guide the method name generation model. We
apply a dual selective gate in encoder to control the information flow, and a
dual attention mechanism in decoder to combine the semantics of input code
sequence and keywords. Experiment results on an open source dataset demonstrate
that keywords guidance can facilitate method naming task, which enables our
model to outperform the competitive state-of-the-art models by margins of
1.5\%-3.5\% in ROUGE metrics. Especially when programs share one common token
with method names, our approach improves the absolute ROUGE-1 score by 7.8\%.

significant and robust transmission drop is observed at the SS band edge due to
quantum interference in both metallic and molecular junctions, in good

geometric models. Specifically, we first develop an unbiased WLS estimator by
utilizing hybrid delay/angular measurements, which determine the location and
velocity of the UE in only one estimator, and can obtain the location and
velocity of scatterers further. The proposed estimator can achieve the CRLB and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Second, we establish a NN-assisted

proposed WLS localization model with NNs to learn higher-order error
components, thereby enhancing the performance of the estimator. The solution
possesses the powerful learning ability of the NN and the robustness of the
proposed geometric model. Moreover, the ensemble learning is applied to improve
the localization accuracy further. Comprehensive simulations show that the
proposed NN-WLS is superior to the benchmark methods in terms of localization

to estimate the functional relationship to map the similarity/dissimilarity

is adaptable to different modalities of data and can be implemented in a
self-supervised way. We verify the generality of the proposed approach through

of geometric mapping models and the alignment of crowd-sourced trajectories;
ii) quantitatively evaluating the positioning performance. The 68\% of the

a set of incoherent forecasts into coherent forecasts to satisfy a given set of
linear constraints. Commonly used projection matrix based approaches for point
forecast reconciliation are OLS (ordinary least squares), WLS (weighted least
squares), and MinT (minimum trace). Even though point forecast reconciliation
is a well-established field of research, the literature on generating
probabilistic forecasts subject to linear constraints is somewhat limited.
Available methods follow a two-step procedure. Firstly, it draws future sample
paths from the univariate models fitted to each series in the collection (which
are incoherent). Secondly, it uses a projection matrix based approach or
empirical copula based reordering approach to account for contemporaneous
correlations and linear constraints. The projection matrices are estimated
either by optimizing a scoring rule such as energy or variogram score, or
simply using a projection matrix derived for point forecast reconciliation.
  This paper proves that (a) if the incoherent predictive distribution is
Gaussian then MinT minimizes the logarithmic scoring rule; and (b) the
logarithmic score of MinT for each marginal predictive density is smaller than
that of OLS. We show these theoretical results using a set of simulation
studies. We also evaluate them using the Australian domestic tourism data set.

commonly used methods are GLS (generalized least squares), OLS (ordinary least

have similar mathematical expressions, but they differ by the covariance matrix
used. OLS and WLS can be considered as special cases of MinT where they differ
by the assumptions made about the structure of the covariance matrix. All these
methods ensure that the reconciled forecasts are unbiased, provided that the
base forecasts are unbiased. The ERM (empirical risk minimizer) approach was
proposed to relax the assumption of unbiasedness.
  This paper proves that (a) GLS and MinT reduce to the same solution; (b) on
average, a method similar to ERM (which we refer to as MinT-U) can produce
better forecasts than MinT (lowest total mean squared error) which is then
followed by OLS and then by base; and (c) the mean squared error of each series

proposed approach is based on an optimization procedure that directly optimizes
the latent code of a pre-trained (state-of-the-art) Generative Adversarial
Network (i.e., StyleGAN2) with respect to several constraints that ensure: (i)
preservation of relevant image content, (ii) generation of the targeted facial

significant achievements have been made in the field of face detection.
Typically, the architectures of the backbone, feature pyramid layer, and
detection head module within the face detector all assimilate the excellent
experience from general object detectors. However, several effective methods,
including label assignment and scale-level data augmentation strategy, fail to
maintain consistent superiority when applying on the face detector directly.
Concretely, the former strategy involves a vast body of hyper-parameters and
the latter one suffers from the challenge of scale distribution bias between
different detection tasks, which both limit their generalization abilities.
Furthermore, in order to provide accurate face bounding boxes for facial
down-stream tasks, the face detector imperatively requires the elimination of
false alarms. As a result, practical solutions on label assignment, scale-level
data augmentation, and reducing false alarms are necessary for advancing face
detectors. In this paper, we focus on resolving three aforementioned challenges
that exiting methods are difficult to finish off and present a novel face
detector, termed MogFace. In our Mogface, three key components, Adaptive Online
Incremental Anchor Mining Strategy, Selective Scale Enhancement Strategy and
Hierarchical Context-Aware Module, are separately proposed to boost the
performance of face detectors. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, our
MogFace is the best face detector on the Wider Face leader-board, achieving all
champions across different testing scenarios. The code is available at

conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells are urgently needed. In this
work, based on semiconductor physics, the expressions of bulk and surface
recombination currents are analytically derived. Then taking the optical loss,
series and shunt resistance losses, and bulk and surface recombination losses
into consideration, an equivalent circuit model is proposed to describe the
current density-voltage characteristics of practical perovskite solar cells.
Furthermore, by comparing to the drift-diffusion model, the pre-defined
physical parameters of the drift-diffusion model well agree with the fitting
parameters retrieved by the equivalent circuit model, which verifies the
reliability of the proposed model. Moreover, when the circuit model is applied
to analyze experimental results, the fitting outcomes show favorable
consistency to the physical investigations offered by the experiments. And the
relative fitting errors of the above cases are all less than 2%. Through
employing the model, the dominant recombination type is clearly identified and
split current density-voltage curves characterizing different loss mechanisms
are offered, which intuitively reveals the physical principles of efficiency
loss. Additionally, through calculating the efficiency loss ratios under the
open-circuit voltage condition, quantifying the above-mentioned loss mechanisms
becomes simple and compelling. Consequently, this model offers a guideline to
approach the efficiency limit from a circuit-level perspective. And the model
is a comprehensive simulation and analysis tool for understanding the device
physics of perovskite solar cells.

expression (even in presence of new physics scenario as long as the mixing

studying the evolution of LUT parameters and the Jarlskog invariant.
Interestingly, the geometric approach based on LUT allows us to express the

only three (and not four) degrees of freedom which are related to the geometric
properties (sides and angles) of the triangle. Moreover, the LUT parameters are
invariant under rephasing transformations and independent of the

that capture the physical properties of the scene, e.g., the position and

features in an unsupervised manner from simulated, self-supervised, robot
interaction; the idea being that high-level physical properties are well
captured by modern physical simulators, and their representation from visual
inputs may transfer well to the real world. In particular, learning methods
based on noise contrastive estimation have shown promising results. To
robustify the simulation-to-real transfer, domain randomization (DR) was
suggested for learning features that are invariant to irrelevant visual
properties such as textures or lighting. In this work, however, we show that a
naive application of DR to unsupervised learning based on contrastive
estimation does not promote invariance, as the loss function maximizes mutual
information between the features and both the relevant and irrelevant visual
properties. We propose a simple modification of the contrastive loss to fix
this, exploiting the fact that we can control the simulated randomization of
visual properties. Our approach learns physical features that are significantly
more robust to visual domain variation, as we demonstrate using both rigid and
non-rigid objects.

behavior has been investigated. In the optical band, the mean spectral index is
-1.71. The source exhibits an obvious special spectral behavior. In the low
state, the source shows a clear bluer-when-brighter behavior in a sense that
the optical spectrum turns harder (flatter) when the brightness increases.
While in the high state, the optical spectrum is stable, that means the source
spectral index does not vary with the brightness. The correlation analysis has
been performed among optical, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray energy bands. The result
indicates that the variations of $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands are well
correlated without time delay on the time scale of days, and their variations
exhibit weak correlations with those of optical band. The variations, especial

The substellar nature of TOI-263b was explored using multi-color photometry,
which determined a true radius of 0.87+-0.21 Rj, establishing TOI-263b's nature
ranging from an inflated Neptune to a brown dwarf. The orbital period-radius

redundancy in graph data, and lack of interpretation for prediction results,
impede further development of GCN. One solution is to recognize a predictive
yet compressed subgraph to get rid of the noise and redundancy and obtain the
interpretable part of the graph. This setting of subgraph is similar to the
information bottleneck (IB) principle, which is less studied on
graph-structured data and GCN. Inspired by the IB principle, we propose a novel
subgraph information bottleneck (SIB) framework to recognize such subgraphs,
named IB-subgraph. However, the intractability of mutual information and the
discrete nature of graph data makes the objective of SIB notoriously hard to
optimize. To this end, we introduce a bilevel optimization scheme coupled with
a mutual information estimator for irregular graphs. Moreover, we propose a
continuous relaxation for subgraph selection with a connectivity loss for
stabilization. We further theoretically prove the error bound of our estimation
scheme for mutual information and the noise-invariant nature of IB-subgraph.
Extensive experiments on graph learning and large-scale point cloud tasks

project the input point cloud to a top view to create a density map and extract

MCTS, an algorithm originally designed to learn to play games, to select the
room proposals by maximizing an objective function combining the fitness with
the density map as predicted by a deep network and regularizing terms on the
room shapes. We also introduce a refinement step to MCTS that adjusts the shape

has been actively studied to improve the overall image quality. Unfortunately,
these methods are often observed less effective or inefficient in handling
conditional GANs (cGANs) -- conditioning on a class (aka class-conditional
GANs) or a continuous variable (aka continuous cGANs or CcGANs). In this work,
we introduce an effective and efficient subsampling scheme, named conditional
density ratio-guided rejection sampling (cDR-RS), to sample high-quality images
from cGANs. Specifically, we first develop a novel conditional density ratio
estimation method, termed cDRE-F-cSP, by proposing the conditional Softplus
(cSP) loss and an improved feature extraction mechanism. We then derive the
error bound of a density ratio model trained with the cSP loss. Finally, we
accept or reject a fake image in terms of its estimated conditional density
ratio. A filtering scheme is also developed to increase fake images' label
consistency without losing diversity when sampling from CcGANs. We extensively
test the effectiveness and efficiency of cDR-RS in sampling from both
class-conditional GANs and CcGANs on five benchmark datasets. When sampling
from class-conditional GANs, cDR-RS outperforms modern state-of-the-art methods
by a large margin (except DRE-F-SP+RS) in terms of effectiveness. Although the
effectiveness of cDR-RS is often comparable to that of DRE-F-SP+RS, cDR-RS is
substantially more efficient. When sampling from CcGANs, the superiority of
cDR-RS is even more noticeable in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, with the consumption of reasonable computational resources, cDR-RS can
substantially reduce Label Score without decreasing the diversity of
CcGAN-generated images, while other methods often need to trade much diversity

presents the design of multi-sequence spreading random access (MSRA) which
employs multiple spreading sequences to spread the different symbols of a user

enabling the multi-user detection (MUD) to be modeled into a well-conditioned
multiple measurement vector (MMV) CS problem. The code diversity is quantified
by the decrease in the average Babel mutual coherence among the spreading
sequences. Moreover, we present a two-stage active user detection (AUD) scheme
for both wideband and narrowband implementation. Our theoretical analysis shows
that with MSRA activity misdetection falls exponentially while the size of
GF-RA frame is increased. Finally, the simulation results show that about 82%
increase in utilization of RRs, i.e., more active users, is supported by MSRA

However, the application of GMMs is hindered by the special missing data
problem in EHRs, which manifests two patient-led missing data processes: the
visit process and the response process for an EHR variable conditional on a
patient visiting the clinic. If either process is associated with the process
generating the longitudinal outcomes, then valid inferences require accounting
for a nonignorable missing data mechanism. We propose a Bayesian shared
parameter model that links GMMs of multiple longitudinal health outcomes, the
visit process, and the response process of each outcome given a visit using a
discrete latent class variable. Our focus is on multiple longitudinal health
outcomes for which there can be a clinically prescribed visit schedule. We

modulation has been less investigated also due to the difficulty to develop
robust tools for broadband signals. To face this issue, the natural visibility
graph approach is proposed in this work to map the full velocity signals into
complex networks. We show that the network degree centrality is able to capture
the signal structure at local scales directly from the full signal, thereby
quantifying FM. Velocity signals from numerically-simulated turbulent channel
flows and an experimental turbulent boundary layer are investigated at
different Reynolds numbers. A correction of Taylor's hypothesis for time-series
is proposed to overcome the overprediction of near-wall frequency modulation
obtained when local mean velocity is used as the convective velocity. Results
provide network-based evidences of the large-to-small FM features for all the
three velocity components in the near-wall region, with a reversal mechanism
emerging far from the wall. Additionally, scaling arguments in the view of the
quasi-steady quasi-homogeneous hypothesis are discussed, and a delay-time
between large and small scales very close to the near-wall cycle characteristic
time is detected. Results show that the visibility graph is a parameter-free

describing epidemic data sets (particularly the COVID-19), few of them present
a formal dynamic characterization in terms of equilibrium sets and stability.
Such concepts can be crucial to understand not only how the virus spreads in a
population, but also how to tailor government interventions such as social
distancing, isolation measures, etc. The objective of this work is to provide a
full dynamic characterization of SIR-type systems under single-interval control
actions and, based on it, to find the control action that produces the smallest
number of infected individuals at the end of the epidemic that avoids second
wave outbreaks. %Because of its simplicity, the latter result is intended to be
just a reference/baseline for more complex control strategies related to
general nonpharmaceutical measure (\textit{i.e}., those accounting for the
health system capacity, the number of deaths, etc.). Simulations illustrate the
benefits of the aforementioned results in terms of the herd immunity threshold.

replacement advocated by regulators in the US is the Secured Overnight

trillion market of derivatives and debt tied to the LIBOR. The only SOFR linked
derivative with any significant liquidity and trading history is the SOFR
futures contract, traded at the CME since 2018. We use the historical record of
futures prices to construct dynamic arbitrage-free models for the SOFR term
structure. The models allow you to construct forward-looking SOFR term rates,
imply a SOFR discounting curve and price and risk and risk manage SOFR
derivatives, not yet liquidly traded in the market. We find that a standard
three-factor Gaussian arbitrage-free Nelson-Siegel model describes term rates
very well but a shadow-rate extension is needed to describe the behaviour near
the zero-boundary. We also find that the jumps and seasonal effects observed in
SOFR, do not need to be specifically accounted for in a model for the futures
prices. Finally we study the so-called convexity correction and find that it
becomes significant beyond the 2 year maturity. For validation purposes we
demonstrate that our model aligns closely with the methodology used by the
Federal Reserve to publish indicative SOFR term rates.

every positive equilibrium is complex balanced. Two results on absolute complex

absolutely complex balanced. In the same year, F. Horn and R. Jackson showed
that the (full) converse of the result is not true: any complex balanced mass

Local

Inspired from 2D criss-cross attention used in segmentation task, we propose a
recurrent 3D criss-cross attention (RCCA-3D) module to model the dense
long-range spatiotemporal contextual information in video for action
recognition. The global context is factorized into sparse relation maps. We
model the relationship between points in the same line along the direction of
horizon, vertical and depth at each time, which forms a 3D criss-cross
structure, and duplicate the same operation with recurrent mechanism to
transmit the relation between points in a line to a plane finally to the whole
spatiotemporal space. Compared with the non-local method, the proposed RCCA-3D
module reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs by 25% and 30% for video
context modeling. We evaluate the performance of RCCA-3D with two latest action

charged droplets from the tip of a conical cusp, are among the most prominent
and well-studied examples of EHD instabilities. In liquid-liquid systems, more
complex interface deformation modes than simple Taylor cones can be observed,
with the interface being pushed away from the electrode, and additional cone
structures emerging from the rim of the dimple. In this article, we investigate
the mechanisms behind these deformation modes experimentally and numerically,
and demonstrate that the presence of droplets triggers the dimple at the
interface. In order to characterize the underlying processes, we replace the
pin electrode by a hollow metallic needle with a prescribed electrolyte volume
flow. The submerged electrospray introduces droplets of an aqueous KCl solution
with varying ion concentrations into silicone oils with varying viscosities. By
measuring the corresponding electric current and by optical investigation of
the interface deformation, we study the system response to variations of the
ionic concentration, viscosity, applied voltage as well as flow rate. In
addition to the experiments, we use a finite element solver and compute the
charge transport due to the droplets in the oil phase. Further, we compute the
electric potential distribution, flow field and interface deformation. After
calibration of our model with particle tracking velocimetry data of the flow
inside the oil phase, we reproduce the experimentally observed dimple at the
liquid-liquid interface. In summary, this work highlights the importance of
charged droplets for the complex dynamic modes observed when a liquid-liquid
interface is exposed to a local electric field.

parametrisation of these theories, capturing the redshift dependence of the
equation of state, $w(z)$, and the kinetic braiding parameter, $\alpha_{\rm
B}(z)$, with only two parameters each, and derive their statistical
distribution (a.k.a. theoretical priors) that fit the cosmology of the
underlying model. We have considered two versions of the shift-symmetric model,
one where the energy density of dark energy is given solely by the scalar
field, and another where it also has a contribution from the cosmological
constant. By including current data, we show how theoretical priors can be used
to improve constraints by up to an order of magnitude. Moreover, we show that
shift-symmetric theories without a cosmological constant are observationally
viable. We work up to quartic order in first derivatives of the scalar in the

general shift-symmetric theories. This work establishes an actionable link

simple components that jointly serve the users. In millimeter wave bands, only
a limited set of predetermined beams can be supported. In a network that
consolidates these technologies, downlink analog beam selection stands as a
challenging task for the network sum-rate maximization. Low-cost digital
filters can improve the network sum-rate further. In this work, we propose
low-cost joint designs of analog beam selection and digital filters. The
proposed joint designs achieve significantly higher sum-rates than the disjoint
design benchmark. Supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms can efficiently
approximate the input-output mapping functions of the beam selection decisions
of the joint designs with low computational complexities. Since the training of
ML algorithms is performed off-line, we propose a well-constructed joint design
that combines multiple initializations, iterations, and selection features, as
well as beam conflict control, i.e., the same beam cannot be used for multiple
users. The numerical results indicate that ML algorithms can retain 99-100% of
the original sum-rate results achieved by the proposed well-constructed
designs.

mathematical model capable of embracing the search for extra-terrestrial
intelligence (SETI), Darwinian Evolution and Human History into a single,
unified statistical picture, concisely called Evo-SETI. The relevant
mathematical tools are: (1) Geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the stochastic
process representing evolution as the stochastic increase of the number of
species living on Earth over the last 3.5 billion years. This GBM is well known
in the mathematics of finances (Black-Sholes models). (2) The probability
distributions known as b-lognormals, i.e. lognormals starting at a certain
positive instant b>0 rather than at the origin. In the framework of Darwinian
Evolution, the resulting mathematical construction was shown to be what
evolutionary biologists call Cladistics. (3) The (Shannon) entropy of such
b-lognormals is then seen to represent the 'degree of progress' reached by each
living organism or by each big set of living organisms, like historic human
civilizations. (4) All these results also match with SETI in that the
statistical Drake equation (generalization of the ordinary Drake equation to
encompass statistics) leads just to the lognormal distribution as the
probability distribution for the number of extra-terrestrial civilizations
existing in the Galaxy. (5) The well-known 'Molecular Clock of Evolution',
namely the 'constant rate of Evolution at the molecular level' as shown by
Kimura's Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, identifies with growth rate of
the entropy of our Evo-SETI model. (6) Furthermore, we apply our Evo-SETI model
to lognormal stochastic processes other than GBMs. For instance, we provide two
models for the mass extinctions that occurred in the past. (7) Finally, we show
that the Markov & Korotayev model for Darwinian Evolution identifies with an
Evo-SETI model.

the assumption that all conversions are governed by the same nonlinear mapping.
To address this problem, we propose ""Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for HDR Image
Reconstruction"" (MetaHDR), which applies meta-learning to the LDR-to-HDR
conversion problem using existing HDR datasets. Our key novelty is the
reinterpretation of LDR-to-HDR conversion scenes as independently sampled tasks
from a common LDR-to-HDR conversion task distribution. Naturally, we use a
meta-learning framework that learns a set of meta-parameters which capture the
common structure consistent across all LDR-to-HDR conversion tasks. Finally, we
perform experimentation with MetaHDR to demonstrate its capacity to tackle
challenging LDR-to-HDR image conversions. Code and pretrained models are

monitoring of structures inspires the use of machine learning methods to

Process-Nonlinear Finite Impulse Response (GP-NFIR) model of the nonlinear
self-excited forces acting on structures. Constructed in a nondimensional form,
the model takes the effective wind angle of attack as lagged exogenous input
and outputs a probability distribution of the forces. The nonlinear
input/output function is modeled by a GP regression. Consequently, the model is
nonparametric, thereby circumventing to set up the function's structure a
priori. The training input is designed as random harmonic motion consisting of
vertical and rotational displacements. Once trained, the model can predict the
aerodynamic forces for both prescribed input motion and aeroelastic analysis.
The concept is first verified for a flat plate's analytical solution by
predicting the self-excited forces and flutter velocity. Finally, the framework
is applied to a streamlined and bluff bridge deck based on Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) data. The model's ability to predict nonlinear aerodynamic
forces, flutter velocity, and post-flutter behavior are highlighted.
Applications of the framework are foreseen in the structural analysis during
the design and monitoring of slender line-like structures.

Studies have attempted to understand and quantify such disruptions using
crowdsourced mobility data sets. However, limited research has studied the
justice issues of mobility data in the context of natural disasters. The lack
of research leaves us without an empirical foundation to quantify and control
the possible biases in the data. This study, using 2017 Hurricane Harvey as a
case study, explores three aspects of mobility data that could potentially
cause injustice: representativeness, quality, and precision. We find
representativeness being a major factor contributing to mobility data
injustice. There is a persistent disparity of representativeness across
neighborhoods of different socioeconomic characteristics before, during, and
after the hurricane's landfall. Additionally, we observed significant drops of
data precision during the hurricane, adding uncertainty to locate people and
understand their movements during extreme weather events. The findings
highlight the necessity in understanding and controlling the possible bias of
mobility data as well as developing practical tools through data justice lenses
in collecting and analyzing data during disasters.

drag model and discrete contact forces, we explore the probability of finding
knots at any given time when the fiber is interacting with the ABC class of
flows. The bending rigidity is shown to have a marginal effect compared to that
of increasing the fiber length. Complex knots are formed up to 11 crossings,
but some knots are more probable than others. The finite-time Lyapunov exponent
of the flow is shown to have a positive effect on the knot probability.
Finally, contact forces appear to be crucial since knotted configurations can
remain stable for times much longer than the turnover time of the flow,
something that is not observed when the fiber can freely cross itself.

multi-group analysis of radiative particles (i.e. neutrons and photons). These
advantages are that we can more directly keep track of what percentages of
radiative particles are close to the original high energy and how many are at
significantly lower energy. For photons, the profile of any build-up function
shows that the function is slightly larger than 1.0 at entry, then it rises to
perhaps 2 or 3 within roughly one mean free path of the fast primary particles,
and finally approaches the asymptote of 1.0 as the penetration depth gets
progressively larger. Neutrons deserve a separate treatment. Although it is
lengthier, our algorithm and formulation is much more complete than the popular
formula used among radiologists where exponential decay is modified with a
buildup coefficient. Moreover, a buildup function for neutron fluxes do not
appear to be widely offered in radiological and radiation safety publications.
This paper demonstrates a method to predict the ratio of high energy (circa 1
