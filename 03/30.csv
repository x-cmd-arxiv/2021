complex quasi-projective variety $S$. In this paper, we give a complete
description of the typical Hodge locus for such variations. We prove that it is
either empty or equidistributed with respect to a natural differential form,
\emph{the pull-push form}. In particular, it is always analytically dense when
the pull-push form does not vanish. When the weight is $2$, the Hodge numbers
are $(q,p,q)$ and the dimension of $S$ is least $rq$, we prove that the typical
locus where the Picard rank is at least $r$ is equidistributed in $S$ with
respect to the volume form $c_q^r$, where $c_q$ is the $q$\textsuperscript{th}
Chern form of the Hodge bundle. We obtain also several equidistribution results
of the typical locus in Shimura varieties: a criterion for the density of the
typical Hodge loci of a variety in $\mathcal{A}_g$, equidistribution of certain
families of CM points and equidistribution of Hecke translates of curves and
surfaces in $\mathcal A_g$.
  These results are proved in the much broader context of dynamics on
homogeneous spaces of Lie groups which are of independent interest. The
pull-push form appear in this greater generality and we provide several tools
to determine it and we compute it in many examples.

of WD 1856+534 b, with the intention to derive the slope of the transmission

Rayleigh scattering, could be translated into an estimation of the mass of WD
1856+534 b. However, the resultant transmission spectrum is essentially flat,
and therefore permits only the determination of lower mass limits of 2.4
M$_{\rm{Jup}}$ at the 2-$\sigma$ level, or 1.6 M$_{\rm{Jup}}$ at 3-$\sigma$.
These limits have implications for some of the proposed formation scenarios for
the object. We elaborate on the potential effects of clouds and hazes in our
estimations, based on previous studies of Jupiter and Titan. In addition, we
detected an H$\alpha$ absorption feature in the combined spectrum of the host
white dwarf, that leads to the assignation of a DA classification and allows
derivation of an independent set of atmospheric parameters. Furthermore, the
epochs of five transits were measured with sub-second precision, which
demonstrates that additional objects more massive than $\approx$5

pairwise similarity, is widely used in speech recognition due to its strong
context modeling ability. However, when applied to long sequence data, its
accuracy is reduced. This is caused by the fact that its weighted average
operator may lead to the dispersion of the attention distribution, which
results in the relationship between adjacent signals ignored. To address this
issue, in this paper, we introduce relative-position-awareness self-attention
(RPSA). It not only maintains the global-range dependency modeling ability of
self-attention, but also improves the localness modeling ability. Because the
local window length of the original RPSA is fixed and sensitive to different
test data, here we propose Gaussian-based self-attention (GSA) whose window
length is learnable and adaptive to the test data automatically. We further
generalize GSA to a new residual Gaussian self-attention (resGSA) for the
performance improvement. We apply RPSA, GSA, and resGSA to Transformer-based
speech recognition respectively. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 Mandarin
speech recognition corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods. For example, the resGSA-Transformer achieves a character error rate
(CER) of 5.86% on the test set, which is relative 7.8% lower than that of the
SA-Transformer. Although the performance of the proposed resGSA-Transformer is
only slightly better than that of the RPSA-Transformer, it does not have to
tune the window length manually.

needed to generically find ordinary Hermitian eigenvalue degeneracies.
Higher-order EPs generically require more fine-tuning, and are thus assumed to
play a much less prominent role. Here, however, we illuminate how physically
relevant symmetries make higher-order EPs dramatically more abundant and

LoRa signal are divided into several groups prior to the modulation process in
the proposed FBI-LoRa system. To further improve the system flexibility, we
formulate a generalized modulation scheme and propose scheme II by treating the
SFB groups as an additional type of transmission entity. In scheme II, the
combination of SFB indices and that of SFB group indices are both exploited to
carry the information bits. We derive the theoretical expressions for
bit-error-rate (BER) and throughput of the proposed FBI-LoRa system with two
modulation schemes over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh

performance. Thanks to the appealing superiorities, the proposed FBI-LoRa

model-driven framework for spectral CT system design optimization to maximize
material separability. We apply this tool to optimize the sensitivity spectra
on a spectral CT test bench using a hybrid design which combines source kVp
control and k-edge filtration. Following design optimization, we scanned a
water/iodine phantom with the hybrid spectral CT system and performed
dose-normalized comparisons to two single-technique designs which use only kVp

the hybrid system reduces both standard deviation and crossmaterial noise
correlations compared to the designs where the constituent technologies are
used individually.

universal syntactic dependencies to improve the performance of the model

assistants available today are heavily dependent on language models for various

domain-independent assistants but have limitations when they cater to a

a brand instead of its literal meaning. Generic models are not able to capture
such subtleties. So, in this work, we retrained a distilled version of the BERT
language model on retail domain-specific data for Walmart's voice shopping

downstream tasks. We evaluated the performance of the retrained language model
on four downstream tasks, including intent-entity detection, sentiment

an increase in the performance of all the downstream tasks of up to 1.31% on

For quantum computing (QC), superconducting qubits and artificially trapped
ions are among the leading platforms, but many others also show promise, e.g.
photons, cold atoms, defect centers including Rare-Earth (RE) ions. So far,
results are limited to the regime of noisy intermediate scale qubits (NISQ),
with a small number of qubits and a limited connectivity, and it is likely that
future QC hardware will utilize several existing platforms in different ways.
Thus, it currently makes sense to invest resources broadly and explore the full
range of promising routes to quantum technology. Rare-earth ions in solids
constitute one of the most versatile platforms for future quantum technology.
One advantage is good coherence properties even when confined in strong natural
traps inside a solid-state matrix. This confinement allows very high qubit
densities and correspondingly strong ion-ion couplings. In addition, although
their fluorescence is generally weak, cavity integration can enhance the
emission greatly and enable very good connections to photonic circuits,
including at the telecom wavelengths, making them promising systems for
long-term scalability. The primary aim of this roadmap is to provide a complete
picture of what components a RE quantum computer would consist of, to describe
the details of all parts required to achieve a scalable system, and to discuss
the most promising paths to reach it. In brief, we find that clusters of 50-100
single RE ions can act as high fidelity qubits in small processors, occupying
only about (10 nm)^3. Due to the high capacity for integration of the RE
systems, they be optically read out and connected to other such clusters for
larger scalability. We make suggestions for future improvements, which could
allow the REQC platform to be a leading one.

number $A=2$. Motivated by the possibility of other universes, where the strong
force could be stronger, this paper considers the effects of bound diprotons
and dineutrons on stars. We find that the existence of additional stable nuclei
with $A=2$ has relatively modest effects on the universe. Previous work
indicates that Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) produces more deuterium, but does
not lead to catastrophic heavy element production. This paper revisits BBN
considerations and confirms that the universe is left with an ample supply of
hydrogen and other light nuclei for typical cosmological parameters. Using the
$MESA$ numerical package, we carry out stellar evolution calculations for
universes with stable diprotons, with nuclear cross sections enhanced by large
factors $X$. This work focuses on $X=10^{15}-10^{18}$, but explores the wider
range $X$ = $10^{-3}-10^{18}$. For a given stellar mass, the presence of stable
diprotons leads to somewhat brighter stars, with the radii and photospheric
temperatures roughly comparable to thoese of red giants. The central
temperature decreases from the characteristic value of
$T_c\approx1.5\times10^7$ K for hydrogen burning down to the value of
$T_c\approx10^6$ K characteristic of deuterium burning. The stellar lifetimes
are smaller for a given mass, but with the extended possible mass range, the
smallest stars live for trillions of years, far longer than the current cosmic
age. Finally, the enhanced cross sections allow for small, partially degenerate
objects with mass $M_\ast=1-10M_J$ to produce significant steady-state
luminosity and thereby function as stars.

Type orbital (STO) basis sets of triple- (TZ) and quadruple-$\zeta$ (QZ)
quality whose polarization is adequate for correlated-electron methods and
which contain extra diffuse functions to be able to correctly calculate
electron affinities of molecules with a positive Lowest Unoccupied Molecular
Orbital (LUMO). We demonstrate, that going from TZ to QZ quality consistently
reduces the basis set error of our computed IPs and EAs and we conclude that a
good estimate of these quantities at the CBS limit can be obtained by
extrapolation. With MADs from 70 to 85 meV, our CBS limit extrapolated
ionization potentials are in good agreement with results from FHI-AIMS,
TURBOMOLE, VASP and WEST while they differ by more than 130 meV on average from
nanoGW. With a MAD of 160 meV, our electron affinities are also in good
agreement with the WEST code. Especially for systems with positive LUMOs, the
agreement is excellent. With respect to other codes, the STO type basis sets
generally underestimate EAs of small molecules with strongly bound LUMOs. With
62 meV for IPs and 93 meV for EAs, we find much better agreement to CBS limit
extrapolated results from FHI-AIMS for a set of 250 medium to large organic
molecules.

rainfall are controlled primarily by monsoon intra-seasonal oscillations (MISO)
and low pressure systems (LPS), respectively. The positive and negative phases
of MISO lead to alternate epochs of above-normal (active) and below-normal
(break) spells of rainfall. LPSs are embedded within the different phases of
MISO and are known to produce heavy precipitation events over central India.
Whether the interaction with the MISO phases modulates the precipitation
response of LPSs, and thereby the characteristics of extreme rainfall events
(EREs) remains unaddressed in the available literature. In this study, we
analyze the LPSs that produce EREs of various spatial extents viz., Small,
Medium, and Large over central India from 1979 to 2012. We also compare them
with the LPSs that pass through central India and do not give any ERE
(LPS-noex). We find that thermodynamic characteristics of LPSs that trigger
different spatial extents of EREs are similar. However, they show differences
in their dynamic characteristics. The ERE producing LPSs are slower, moister
and more intense than LPS-noex. The LPSs that lead to Medium and Large EREs
tend to occur during the positive phase of MISO when an active monsoon trough
is present over central India. On the other hand, LPS-noex and the LPSs that
trigger Small EREs occur mainly during the neutral or negative phases of the
MISO. The large-scale dynamic forcing, intensification of LPSs, and diabatic
generation of low-level potential vorticity due to the presence of active
monsoon trough help in the organization of convection and lead to Medium and
Large EREs. On the other hand, the LPSs that form during the negative or
neutral phases of MISO do not intensify much during their lifetime and trigger
scattered convection, leading to EREs of small size.

performance at higher photon number, offer many practical advantages over
single-photon level conditioning detectors. Here we propose a novel approach
involving displacement of the ancilla field into the regime where mesoscopic

simulations accounting for experimental non-idealities such as loss and

  For any car arrival distribution $\mathbf b$, we obtain an explicit

function $B(y)$ of $\mathbf b$. We show that the model has a generic phase
where the singular behavior of $F(x,y)$ is essentially independent of $B(y)$,
and a non-generic phase where it depends sensitively on the singular behavior
of $B(y)$. The non-generic phase is further divided into two cases, which we
call dilute and dense. We give a simple algebraic description of the phase
diagram, and, under mild additional assumptions on $\mathbf b$, carry out
detailed singularity analysis of $F(x,y)$ in the generic and the dilute phases.
The singularity analysis uses the classical transfer theorem, as well as its
generalization for bivariate asymptotics. In the process, we develop a

principled, pure, provably correct define-then-run method for performing
forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation (AD) on programming
languages with expressive features. It implements AD as a compositional,
type-respecting source-code transformation that generates purely functional
code. This code transformation is principled in the sense that it is the unique
homomorphic (structure preserving) extension to expressive languages of
Elliott's well-known and unambiguous definitions of AD for a first-order
functional language. Correctness of the method follows by a (compositional)
logical relations argument that shows that the semantics of the syntactic
derivative is the usual calculus derivative of the semantics of the original
program.
  In their most elegant formulation, the transformations generate code with
linear types. However, the code transformations can be implemented in a
standard functional language lacking linear types: while the correctness proof
requires tracking of linearity, the actual transformations do not. In fact,
even in a standard functional language, we can get all of the type-safety that
linear types give us: we can implement all linear types used to type the
transformations as abstract types, by using a basic module system.
  In this paper, we detail the method when applied to a simple higher-order
language for manipulating statically sized arrays. However, we explain how the
methodology applies, more generally, to functional languages with other
expressive features. Finally, we discuss how the scope of CHAD extends beyond
applications in AD to other dynamic program analyses that accumulate data in a
commutative monoid.

over-representation of closed squares, which we quantify using an existing

us ferry insights between domains. PPI networks are shaped by complementarity,
rather than homophily, and we use multi-layer directed configuration models to
show that this principle explains the emergence of functional structure in
production networks. Companies are especially similar to their close

global orientation and spin, so it needs to be anchored in the radio-based
International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) to provide a referenced and
quasi-inertial celestial coordinate system. The link between the two
fundamental frames is realized through two samples of distant extragalactic
sources, mostly AGNs and quasars, but only the smaller sample of radio-loud
ICRF sources with optical counterparts is available to determine the mutual
orientation. The robustness of this link can be mathematically formulated in
the framework of functional principal component analysis using a set of vector
spherical harmonics to represent the differences in celestial positions of the
common objects. The weakest eigenvectors are computed, which describe the
greatest deficiency of the link. The deficient or poorly determined terms are
specific vector fields on the sphere which carry the largest errors of absolute
astrometry using Gaia in reference to the ICRF. This analysis provides
guidelines to the future development of the ICRF maximizing the accuracy of the
link over the entire celestial sphere. A measure of robustness of a
least-squares solution, which can be applied to any linear model fitting

items, the leader interdicts the usage of some of the items of the follower in
order to minimize the objective value achievable by the follower, who seeks to
maximize a submodular set function over the uninterdicted items subject to
knapsack constraints.
  We propose an exact branch-and-cut algorithm for these kind of interdiction
games. The algorithm is based on interdiction cuts which allow to capture the
follower's objective function value for a given interdiction decision of the
leader and exploit the submodularity of the objective function. We also present
extensions and liftings of these cuts and discuss additional preprocessing

  We test our solution framework on the weighted maximal covering interdiction

major research in the attempt to generate machines that can understand the way
subjects feel, act and react. In the past, due to the unavailability of large
amounts of data captured in real-life situations, research has mainly focused
on controlled environments. However, recently, social media and platforms have
been widely used. Moreover, deep learning has emerged as a means to solve
visual analysis and recognition problems. This paper exploits these advances
and presents significant contributions for affect analysis and recognition
in-the-wild. Affect analysis and recognition can be seen as a dual knowledge
generation problem, involving: i) creation of new, large and rich in-the-wild
databases and ii) design and training of novel deep neural architectures that
are able to analyse affect over these databases and to successfully generalise
their performance on other datasets. The paper focuses on large in-the-wild
databases, i.e., Aff-Wild and Aff-Wild2 and presents the design of two classes
of deep neural networks trained with these databases. The first class refers to
uni-task affect recognition, focusing on prediction of the valence and arousal
dimensional variables. The second class refers to estimation of all main
behavior tasks, i.e. valence-arousal prediction; categorical emotion
classification in seven basic facial expressions; facial Action Unit detection.
A novel multi-task and holistic framework is presented which is able to jointly
learn and effectively generalize and perform affect recognition over all
existing in-the-wild databases. Large experimental studies illustrate the
achieved performance improvement over the existing state-of-the-art in affect

similar tasks or instances of the same task family impose latent manifold
constraints on the most effective action space: the task family can be best
solved with actions in a manifold of the entire action space of the robot.
Combining these insights we present LASER, a method to learn latent action
spaces for efficient reinforcement learning. LASER factorizes the learning
problem into two sub-problems, namely action space learning and policy learning
in the new action space. It leverages data from similar manipulation task
instances, either from an offline expert or online during policy learning, and
learns from these trajectories a mapping from the original to a latent action
space. LASER is trained as a variational encoder-decoder model to map raw
actions into a disentangled latent action space while maintaining action
reconstruction and latent space dynamic consistency. We evaluate LASER on two
contact-rich robotic tasks in simulation, and analyze the benefit of policy
learning in the generated latent action space. We show improved sample
efficiency compared to the original action space from better alignment of the
action space to the task space, as we observe with visualizations of the
learned action space manifold. Additional details:

combining annular intensity diffraction tomography (aIDT) with an
approximant-guided deep learning framework. Using a novel physics model
simulator-based learning strategy trained entirely on natural image datasets,
we show our network can robustly reconstruct complex 3D biological samples of
arbitrary size and structure. This approach highlights that large-scale
multiple-scattering models can be leveraged in place of acquiring experimental
datasets for achieving highly generalizable deep learning models. We devise a
new model-based data normalization pre-processing procedure for homogenizing
the sample contrast and achieving uniform prediction quality regardless of
scattering strength. To achieve highly efficient training and prediction, we
implement a lightweight 2D network structure that utilizes a multi-channel
input for encoding the axial information. We demonstrate this framework's
capabilities on experimental measurements of epithelial buccal cells and
Caenorhabditis elegans worms. We highlight the robustness of this approach by
evaluating dynamic samples on a living worm video, and we emphasize our

undergoes a spin-flop transition at intermediate fields, resulting in a canted
phase before saturation. In this work, we experimentally show that the
anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in MnBi2Te4 originates from a topological response
that is sensitive to the perpendicular magnetic moment and to its canting
angle. Synthesis by molecular beam epitaxy allows us to obtain a large-area
quasi-3D 24-layer MnBi2Te4 with near-perfect compensation that hosts the phase
diagram observed in bulk which we utilize to probe the AHE. This AHE is seen to
exhibit an antiferromagnetic response at low magnetic fields, and a clear
evolution at intermediate fields through surface and bulk spin-flop transitions
into saturation. Throughout this evolution, the AHE is super-linear versus
magnetization rather than the expected linear relationship. We reveal that this
discrepancy is related to the canting angle, consistent with the symmetry of

persistent spaces. DMTs combine both $\pi_0$ and $H_n$ information into a
single data structure that distinguishes filtrations that merge trees and
persistent homology cannot distinguish alone. Three variants on DMTs, which
emphasize category theory, representation theory and persistence barcodes,
respectively, offer different advantages in terms of theory and computation.
Two notions of distance -- an interleaving distance and bottleneck distance --
for DMTs are defined and a hierarchy of stability results that both refine and
generalize existing stability results is proved here. To overcome some of the
computational complexity inherent in these distances, we provide a novel use of
Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to compute optimal merge tree alignments for a
combinatorial version of our interleaving distance which can be tractably
estimated. We introduce computational frameworks for generating, visualizing
and comparing decorated merge trees derived from synthetic and real data.
Example applications include comparison of point clouds, interpretation of
persistent homology of sliding window embeddings of time series, visualization
of topological features in segmented brain tumor images and topology-driven
graph alignment.

withstand the high radiation environment in the ATLAS detector after the High
Luminosity Upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which will
significantly increase the rate of particle collisions and resulting particle

performance. One characteristic of interest for highly irradiated sensors is
the shape and homogeneity of the electric field inside its active area. For the

pressure of the generator to synthesize rich details by directly feeding the
high-frequency information of the input image into the end of the generator.
Second, we adopt an additional discriminator to encourage the generator to
synthesize rich details. Specifically, we apply wavelet transformation to
transform the image into multi-frequency domains, among which the
high-frequency parts can be used to recover the rich details. We also notice
that a fine-grained and wider-range control for the attribute is of great
importance for face editing. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel attribute

planet formation and orbital evolution, through external photoevaporation and
stellar flybys. Recent work has claimed observational support for this, in the
form of a correlation between the properties of planetary systems and the local
Galactic phase space density of the host star. In particular, Hot Jupiters are
found overwhelmingly around stars in regions of high phase space density, which
may reflect a formation environment with high stellar density. Aims. We instead
investigate whether the high phase space density may have a galactic kinematic
origin: Hot Jupiter hosts may be biased towards being young and therefore
kinematically cold, because tidal inspiral leads to the destruction of the
planets on Gyr timescales, and the velocity dispersion of stars in the Galaxy
increases on similar timescales. Methods. We use 6D positions and kinematics
from Gaia for the Hot Jupiter hosts and their neighbours, and construct
distributions of the phase space density. We investigate correlations between
the stars' local phase space density and peculiar velocity. Results. We find a
strong anticorrelation between the phase space density and the host star's
peculiar velocity with respect to the Local Standard of Rest. Therefore, most
stars in ""high-density"" regions are kinematically cold, which may be caused by
the aforementioned bias towards detecting Hot Jupiters around young stars
before the planets' tidal destruction. Conclusions. We do not find evidence in
the data for Hot Jupiter hosts preferentially being in phase space
overdensities compared to other stars of similar kinematics, nor therefore for
their originating in birth environments of high stellar density.

results with the predictions of different ISM/CGM models, we favor a dusty
ISM/CGM model where dust resides in HI gas clumps and Ly$\alpha$ photons escape
through the low HI covering fraction/column density intra-clump medium.
Finally, we investigate the factors that potentially contribute to the
intrinsic scatter in the correlations studied in this work, including
metallicity, outflow kinematics, Ly$\alpha$ production efficiency, and slit
loss. Specifically, we find evidence that scatter in the relationship between
EW$_{Ly\alpha}$ and E(B-V) reflects the variation in metal-to-HI covering
fraction ratio as a function of metallicity, and the effects of outflows on the
porosity of the ISM/CGM. Future simulations incorporating star-formation
feedback and the radiative transfer of Ly$\alpha$ photons will provide key
constraints on the spatial distributions of neutral hydrogen gas and dust in

persistence of the ""Hubble tension"" calls the base $\Lambda$CDM model's

Dark Energy (EDE) that modify the assumed expansion history of the Universe. We
investigate the effect of EDE on the redshift-time relation $z \leftrightarrow

viable, any inferred $t \leftarrow z$ or $z \leftarrow t$ quoted to a higher
level of precision do not reflect the current status of our understanding of
cosmology. This uncertainty has important astrophysical implications: the
reionization epoch - $10>z>6$ - corresponds to disjoint lookback time periods
in the base $\Lambda$CDM and EDE models, and the EDE value of $t_0=13.25 \pm
0.17~{\rm Gyr}$ is in tension with published ages of some stars, star clusters,
and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. However, most published stellar ages do not
include an uncertainty in accuracy (due to, e.g., uncertain distances and
stellar physics) that is estimated to be $\sim7-10\%$, potentially reconciling
stellar ages with $t_{0,\rm EDE}$. We discuss how the big data era for stars is
providing extremely precise ages ($<1\%$) and how improved distances and
treatment of stellar physics such as convection could result in ages accurate

upcoming terrestrial dark matter direct detection experiments. If dark energy
is driven by a new light degree of freedom coupled to matter and photons then
dark energy quanta are predicted to be produced in the Sun. These quanta
free-stream towards Earth where they can interact with Standard Model particles
in the detection chambers of direct detection experiments, presenting the
possibility that these experiments could be used to test dark energy. Screening
mechanisms, which suppress fifth forces associated with new light particles,
and are a necessary feature of many dark energy models, prevent production
processes from occurring in the core of the Sun, and similarly, in the cores of
red giant, horizontal branch, and white dwarf stars. Instead, the coupling of
dark energy to photons leads to production in the strong magnetic field of the
solar tachocline via a mechanism analogous to the Primakoff process. This then
allows for detectable signals on Earth while evading the strong constraints
that would typically result from stellar probes of new light particles. As an
example, we examine whether the electron recoil excess recently reported by the
XENON1T collaboration can be explained by chameleon-screened dark energy, and
find that such a model is preferred over the background-only hypothesis at the
$2.0\sigma$ level, in a large range of parameter space not excluded by stellar
(or other) probes. This raises the tantalizing possibility that XENON1T may
have achieved the first direct detection of dark energy. Finally, we study the
prospects for confirming this scenario using planned future detectors such as
XENONnT, PandaX-4T, and LUX-ZEPLIN.

Young diagrams of Lorentz subgroup and global symmetry $U(N)$ respectively ($N$

extremely challenging because host star images are dominated by the telescope
diffraction pattern. Using a coronagraph is an efficient solution for removing
diffraction but requires an incoming wavefront with good quality to maximize
starlight rejection. On the ground, the most advanced exoplanet imagers use
extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems that are based on a deformable mirror
(DM) with a large number of actuators to efficiently compensate for high-order
aberrations and provide diffraction-limited images. While several exoplanet
imagers with DMs using around 1500 actuators are now routinely operating on
large telescopes to observe gas giant planets, future systems may require a
tenfold increase in the number of degrees of freedom to look for rocky planets.
In this paper, we explore wavefront correction with a secondary adaptive optics
system that controls a very large number of degrees of freedom that are not
corrected by the primary ExAO system. Using Marseille Imaging Testbed for High
Contrast (MITHiC), we implement a second stage of adaptive optics with ZELDA, a
Zernike wavefront sensor, and a spatial light modulator (SLM) to compensate for
the phase aberrations of the bench downstream residual aberrations from

through a background medium, known as dynamical friction (DF), is key to our
understanding of many astrophysical systems. We present a series of
high-resolution simulations of gaseous DF using Lagrangian hydrodynamics
solvers, in the state-of-the-art multi-physics code, GIZMO. The numerical setup
is chosen to allow direct comparison to analytic predictions for DF in the
range of Mach 0.2<M<3. We investigate, in detail, the DF drag force, the radial
structure of the wake, and their time evolution. The subsonic forces are shown
to be well resolved, except at Mach numbers close to M=1. The supersonic cases,
close to M=1, significantly under-shoot the predicted force. We find that for
scenarios with 0.7<M<2, between 10%-50% of the expected DF force is missing.
The origin of this deficit is mostly related to the wake structure close to the
perturber, where the density profile of the Mach cone face shows significant
smoothing, which does not improve with time. The spherical expanding
perturbation of the medium is captured well by the hydro scheme, but it is the
sharp density structure, at the transition from Mach cone to average density,
that introduces the mismatch. However, we find a general improvement of the
force deficit with time, though significant differencesremain, in agreement
with other studies. This is due to (1) the structure of the far field wake
being reproduced well, and (2) the fraction of total drag from the far field
wake increasing with time. Dark matter sub-haloes, in typical cosmological
simulations, occupy parameters similar to those tested here, suggesting that
the DF which these sub-haloes experience is significantly underestimated, and
hence their merger rate. Dynamical friction is a relevant benchmark and should
be included as one of the standard hydro tests for astrophysical simulations.

is vital for determining how galaxies contributed to reionization in the early
universe. While directly detecting Lyman continuum from high redshift galaxies
is impossible due to the intergalactic medium, low redshift galaxies in
principle offer this possibility, but requirie observations from space. The
first local galaxy for which Lyman continuum escape was found is Haro11 , a
luminous blue compact galaxy at z=0.02, where observations with the FUSE
satellite revealed an escape fraction of 3.3 %. However the FUSE aperture
covers the entire galaxy, and it is not clear from where the Lyman continuum is
leaking out. Here we utilize HST/COS spectroscopy in the wavelength range
1100-1700 A of the three knots (A, B, and C) of Haro11 to study the presence of
Ly-$\alpha$ emission and the properties of intervening gas. We find that all
knots have bright Ly-$\alpha$ emission. UV absorption lines, originating in the
neutral interstellar medium, as well as lines probing the ionized medium, are
seen extending to blue shifted velocities of 500 km/s in all three knots,
demonstrating the presence of an outflowing multiphase medium. We find that
knots A and B have large covering fractions of neutral gas, making LyC escape
along these sightlines improbable, while knot C has a much lower covering
fraction ($\lesssim50$%). Knot C also has the the highest Ly-$\alpha$ escape
fraction and we conclude that it is the most likely source of the escaping
Lyman continuum detected in Haro11.

in the classification accuracy, from which we infer a characteristic
classification length scale. It displays a power-law divergence at the critical
point, with a scaling exponent that matches with the diverging correlation
length. Our algorithm correctly identifies the thermodynamic phase of the
system and extracts scaling behavior from projective measurements,
independently of the basis in which the measurements are performed.
Furthermore, we show the classification length scale is absent for the $q=6$
Potts model, which has a first order transition and thus lacks a divergent
correlation length. The main intuition underlying our finding is that, for
measurement patches of sizes smaller than the correlation length, the system
appears to be at the critical point, and therefore the algorithm cannot

equation is derived by employing reductive perturbation method. It can be seen
that under consideration of non-relativistic positively charged heavy and light
ions, the plasma model supports only positive electrostatic shock structure. It
is also observed that the charge state and number density of the
non-relativistic heavy and light ions enhance the amplitude of IASHWs, and the
steepness of the shock profile is decreased with ion kinematic viscosity
($\eta$). The findings of our present investigation will be helpful in
understanding the nonlinear propagation of IASHWs in white dwarfs and neutron
stars.

superconductors (TSC) and topological insulators (TI) are trivialized, which
means the boundary state of the system can be trivially gapped out by
interaction without leading to symmetry breaking or topological ground state
degeneracy. This phenomenon is also referred to as ""symmetric mass generation""
(SMG), and has attracted broad attentions from both the condensed matter and
high energy physics communities. However, after the trivialization caused by
interaction, some trace of the nontrivial topology of the system still
persists. Previous studies have indicated that interacting topological TSC and
TI could be related to the ""zero"" of Green's function, namely the fermion
Green's function $G(\mathrm{i} \omega \rightarrow 0) = 0$. In this work,
through the general ""decorated defect"" construction of symmetry protected
topological (SPT) states, we demonstrate the existence of Green's function zero
after SMG, by mapping the evaluation of the Green's function to the problem of
a single particle path integral. This method can be extended to the cases
without spatial translation symmetry, where the momentum space which hosts many
quantized topological numbers is no longer meaningful. Using the same method
one can demonstrate the existence of the Green's function zero at the ""avoided

near to the line of sight, and a strong shock front. These phenomena should all
contribute to making Abell 3266 an optimum cluster to see the global effects of
RPS induced star formation. Using archival X-ray observations and published
optical data, we cross-correlate optical spectral properties ([OII, H$\beta$]),
indicative of starburst and post starburst, respectively with ram-pressure,
$\rho$v$^{2}$, calculated from the X-ray and optical data. We find that
post-starburst galaxies, classified as E+A, occur at a higher frequency in this
merging cluster than in the Coma cluster and at a comparable rate to
intermediate redshift clusters. This is consistent with increased star
formation due to the merger. However, both starburst and post-starburst
galaxies are equally likely to be in a low or high ram pressure environment.
From this result we infer that the duration of the starburst phase must be very
brief so that: (1) at any time only a small fraction of the galaxies in a high
ram pressure environment show this effect, and (2) most post-starburst galaxies
are in an environment of low ram pressure due too their continued orbital
motion in the cluster.

unknown dynamics. It has been shown that stabilizing affine control systems to
desired (sets of) states while optimizing quadratic costs subject to state and
control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of quadratic programs (QPs) by
using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs).
Our recently proposed High Order CBFs (HOCBFs) can accommodate constraints of
arbitrary relative degree. One of the main challenges in this approach is
obtaining accurate system dynamics, which is especially difficult for systems
that require online model identification given limited computational resources
and system data. In order to approximate the real unmodelled system dynamics,
we define adaptive affine control dynamics which are updated based on the error
states obtained by real-time sensor measurements. We define a HOCBF for a
safety requirement on the unmodelled system based on the adaptive dynamics and
error states, and reformulate the safety-critical control problem as the above
mentioned QP. Then, we determine the events required to solve the QP in order
to guarantee safety. We also derive a condition that guarantees the
satisfaction of the HOCBF constraint between events. We illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework on an adaptive cruise control problem
and compare it with the classical time-driven approach.

for enhancing coherence of weakly entangled states. At the same time, coherence
of edge modes in certain symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases can
persist away from the ground state. In this work we show the existence of
many-body scars and their implications on bulk coherence in such an SPT phase.
To this end, we study the eigenstate properties and the dynamics of an
interacting spin-$1/2$ chain with three-site ""cluster"" terms hosting a
$\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase. Focusing on the weakly
interacting regime, we find that eigenstates with volume-law entanglement
coexist with area-law entangled eigenstates throughout the spectrum. We show
that a subset of the latter can be constructed by virtue of repeated cluster
excitations on the even or odd sublattice of the chain, resulting in an
equidistant ""tower"" of states, analogous to the phenomenology of quantum
many-body scars. We further demonstrate that these scarred eigenstates support
nonthermal expectation values of local cluster operators in the bulk and
exhibit signatures of topological order even at finite energy densities.
Studying the dynamics for out-of-equilibrium states drawn from the
noninteracting ""cluster basis"", we unveil that nonthermalizing bulk dynamics
can be observed on long time scales if clusters on odd and even sites are
energetically detuned. In this case, cluster excitations remain essentially
confined to one of the two sublattices such that inhomogeneous cluster
configurations cannot equilibrate and thermalization of the full system is
impeded. Our work sheds light on the role of quantum many-body scars in
preserving SPT order at finite temperature and the possibility of coherent bulk
dynamics in models with SPT order beyond the existence of long-lived edge
modes.

asymptotic stability for solutions nearby the relativistic Maxwellian. We work
in the case of a spatially periodic box. We assume the generic hard-interaction
and soft-interaction conditions on the collision kernel that were derived by
Dudy\'nski and Ekiel-Je$\dot{\text{z}}$ewska (Comm. Math. Phys.
\textbf{115}(4):607--629, 1985), and our assumptions include the case of Israel
particles (J. Math. Phys. \textbf{4}:1163--1181, 1963). In this physical
situation, the angular function in the collision kernel is not locally
integrable, and the collision operator behaves like a fractional diffusion
operator. The coercivity estimates that are needed rely crucially on the sharp
asymptotics for the frequency multiplier that has not been previously
established. We further derive the relativistic analogue of the Carleman dual
representation for the Boltzmann collision operator. This resolves the open
question of perturbative global existence and uniqueness without the Grad's
angular cut-off assumption.

the obtained results indicates a significant influence of the relativistic

applications including target tracking, control of multi-robot swarms, and
multiplayer games. A key challenge in MMDPs occurs when the state and action
spaces grow exponentially in the number of agents, making computation of an
optimal policy computationally intractable for medium- to large-scale problems.
One property that has been exploited to mitigate this complexity is transition
independence, in which each agent's transition probabilities are independent of
the states and actions of other agents. Transition independence enables
factorization of the MMDP and computation of local agent policies but does not
hold for arbitrary MMDPs. In this paper, we propose an approximate transition
dependence property, called $\delta$-transition dependence and develop a metric
for quantifying how far an MMDP deviates from transition independence. Our
definition of $\delta$-transition dependence recovers transition independence
as a special case when $\delta$ is zero. We develop a polynomial time algorithm
in the number of agents that achieves a provable bound on the global optimum
when the reward functions are monotone increasing and submodular in the agent
actions. We evaluate our approach on two case studies, namely, multi-robot

contrast agents boasting biocompatible components, unique phase-change
dynamics, and therapeutic loading capabilities. Upon exposure to a sufficiently
high intensity pulse of acoustic energy, the nanodroplet perfluorocarbon core
undergoes a liquid-to-gas phase change and becomes an echogenic microbubble,
providing ultrasound contrast. The controllable activation leads to
high-contrast images, while the small size of the nanodroplets promotes longer
circulation times and better in-vivo stability. One drawback, however, is that
the nanodroplets can only be vaporized a single time, limiting their
versatility. Recently, we and others have address this issue by using a
perfluorohexane core, which has a boiling point above body temperature. Thus
after vaporization, the microbubbles recondense back into their stable
nanodroplets form. Previous work with perfluorohexane nanodroplets relied on
optical activation via pulse laser absorption of an encapsulated dye. This
strategy limits the imaging depth and temporal resolution of the method. In
this study we overcome these limitations by demonstrating acoustic droplet
vaporization with 1.1-MHz high intensity focused ultrasound. A short-duration,
high-amplitude pulse of focused ultrasound provides a sufficiently strong peak
negative pressure to initiate vaporization. When using a custom imaging
sequence with a high-frequency transducer, the repeated acoustic activation of
perfluorohexane nanodroplets can be visualized in polyacrylamide
tissue-mimicking phantoms. We demonstrate detection of hundreds of vaporization
events from individual nanodroplets with activation thresholds well below the
tissue cavitation limit. Overall, this approach has the potential to result in
reliable contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging at clinically relevant depths.

elusive whether there are novel magnetic phenomena only belonging to vdW

the quantum correlations of magnons in a layered vdW magnet and identify an
entanglement channel of magnons across the magnetic layers, which can be
effectively tuned and even deterministically switched on and off by both
magnetic and electric means. This is a unique feature of vdW magnets in which
the underlying physics is well understood in terms of the competing roles of
exchange and anisotropy fields that contribute to the magnon excitation.
Furthermore, we show that such a tunable entanglement channel can mediate the

different gauges for the light-matter interaction. Standard minimal coupling
leads to the velocity gauge, defined by linear coupling to the vector

derive the theory of time-resolved photoemission within both gauges from the

incorporates the photoelectron continuum, which allows for a direct calculation

gauge-invariant expressions for the time-resolved photoemission signal. The
theory is applied to graphene pumped with short terahertz pulses, which we

massive-star evolution. However, for low-luminosity O-type stars there are big
discrepancies between theoretically predicted and empirically derived mass-loss
rates (called the weak-wind problem). Aims. We compute radiation-line-driven
wind models of a typical weak-wind star to determine its temperature structure
and the corresponding impact on ultra-violet (UV) line formation. Methods. We
carried out hydrodynamic simulations of the line-deshadowing instability (LDI)
for a weak-wind star in the Galaxy. Subsequently, we used this LDI model as
input in a short-characteristics radiative transfer code to compute synthetic
UV line profiles. Results. We find that the line-driven weak wind is
significantly shock heated to high temperatures and is unable to cool down
effciently. This results in a complex temperature structure where more than
half of the wind volume has temperatures significantly higher than the stellar
effective temperature. Therefore, a substantial portion of the weak wind will
be more ionised, resulting in a reduction of the UV line opacity and therefore
in weaker line profiles for a given mass-loss rate. Quantifying this, we find
that weak-wind mass-loss rates derived from unsaturated UV lines could be
underestimated by a factor of between 10 and 100 if the high-temperature gas is
not properly taken into account in the spectroscopic analysis. This offers a
tentative basic explanation for the weak-wind problem: line-driven weak winds

show that our new theory and the recently proposed $f(Q)$ gravity models are
equivalent at the level of the action and at the level of the field equations,

also match up with $f(R)$ gravity which is an expected result. Perhaps more
surprisingly, we can also show that this equivalence extends to $f(T)$ gravity

standard approach introduces two sources of training noise. First, audio-visual
correspondences often produce faulty positives since the audio and video
signals can be uninformative of each other. To limit the detrimental impact of
faulty positives, we optimize a weighted contrastive learning loss, which
down-weighs their contribution to the overall loss. Second, since
self-supervised contrastive learning relies on random sampling of negative
instances, instances that are semantically similar to the base instance can be
used as faulty negatives. To alleviate the impact of faulty negatives, we
propose to optimize an instance discrimination loss with a soft target
distribution that estimates relationships between instances. We validate our
contributions through extensive experiments on action recognition tasks and

years of high-precision photometry collected by the Kepler mission to
investigate the fluctuations caused by photospheric convection, stellar
rotation, and starspot evolution as a function of the timescale. Our main goal
is to apply methods for the analysis of timeseries to find the timescales of
the phenomena that affect the light variations. We correlate those timescales
with periodicities in the star as well as in the planetary system. We model the
flux rotational modulation induced by active regions using spot modelling and
apply the MFDMA in standard and multiscale versions for analysing the behaviour
of variability and light fluctuations that can be associated with stellar
convection and the evolution of magnetic fields on timescales ranging from less
than 1 day up to about 35 days. The light fluctuations produced by stellar
activity can be described by the multifractal Hurst index that provides a
measure of their persistence. The spot modeling indicates a lower limit to the
relative surface differential rotation of $\Delta \Omega/\Omega\sim 0.02\pm
0.01$ and suggests a short-term cyclic variation in the starspot area with a
period of $\sim 34$ days, virtually close to the synodic period of 35.2 days of
the planet Kepler-30b. By subtracting the two timeseries of the SAP and PDC
Kepler pipelines, we reduce the rotational modulation and find a 23.1-day
period close to the synodic period of Kepler-30c. This period also appears in
the multifractal analysis as a crossover of the fluctuation functions
associated with the characteristic evolutionary timescales of the active
regions in Kepler-30 as confirmed by spot modelling. These procedures and
methods may be greatly useful for analysing current TESS and future PLATO data.

requirements of such application drove to the realization of Edge computing in
which computation is offloaded near to users. Compute-less networking is an
extension of edge computing that aims at reducing computation and abridging
communication by adopting in-network computing and computation reuse.
Computation reuse aims to cache the result of computations and use them to
perform similar tasks in the future and, therefore, avoid redundant
calculations and optimize the use of resources. In this paper, we focus on the
correctness of the final output produced by computation reuse. Since the input
might not be identical but similar, the reuse of previous computation raises
questions about the accuracy of the final results. To this end, we implement a
proof of concept to study and gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of
computation reuse. We are able to reduce task completion time by up to 80%
while ensuring high correctness. We further discuss open challenges and
highlight future research directions.

engineering spin-polarized edge and topological states, representing a novel
source of non-conventional $\pi$-magnetism with promising applications in
quantum spintronics. A prerequisite for their emergence is the existence of
robust gapped phases, which are difficult to find in extended graphene systems:
only armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) show a band gap that, however, closes
for any other GNR orientation. Here we show that semi-metallic chiral GNRs
(chGNRs) narrowed down to nanometer widths undergoes a topological phase
transition, becoming first topological insulators, and transforming then into
trivial band insulators for the narrowest chGNRs. We fabricated atomically
precise chGNRs of different chirality and size by on surface synthesis using
predesigned molecular precursors. Combining scanning tunnelling microscopy
(STM) measurements and theory simulations, we follow the evolution of
topological properties and bulk band gap depending on the width, length, and
chirality of chGNRs. The first emerging gapped phases are topological,
protected by a chiral interaction pattern between edges. For narrower ribbons,
the symmetry of the interaction pattern changes, and the topological gap closes
and re-opens again as a trivial band insulator. Our findings represent a new
platform for producing topologically protected spin states and demonstrates the
potential of connecting chiral edge and defect structure with band engineering.

space. Despite the popularity, such vector representation limits the
expressivity in terms of modeling the intra-class variability for each class.
We address this issue by leveraging the use of distribution embeddings. More
specifically, both image embeddings and class embeddings are modeled as
Gaussian distributions, where their similarity relationships are preserved
through the use of triplet constraints. The key intuition which guides our
approach is that for each image, the embedding of the correct class label

each other and a shared environment to complete tasks. When rewards provided by
the environment are sparse, agents may not receive immediate feedback on the
quality of actions that they take, thereby affecting learning of policies. In
this paper, we propose a method called Shaping Advice in deep Multi-agent
reinforcement learning (SAM) to augment the reward signal from the environment
with an additional reward termed shaping advice. The shaping advice is given by
a difference of potential functions at consecutive time-steps. Each potential
function is a function of observations and actions of the agents. The shaping
advice needs to be specified only once at the start of training, and can be
easily provided by non-experts. We show through theoretical analyses and
experimental validation that shaping advice provided by SAM does not distract
agents from completing tasks specified by the environment reward.
Theoretically, we prove that convergence of policy gradients and value
functions when using SAM implies convergence of these quantities in the absence
of SAM. Experimentally, we evaluate SAM on three tasks in the multi-agent
Particle World environment that have sparse rewards. We observe that using SAM
results in agents learning policies to complete tasks faster, and obtain higher
rewards than: i) using sparse rewards alone; ii) a state-of-the-art reward

and has never been presented within literature. The lack of an exact modeling
framework is due to the complex nonlinear aerodynamic relationships governed by
the deformations in the flexible-wing shape, which in turn complicates the
controls and instrumentation setup of the navigation system. This urged for
innovative approaches to interface affordable instrumentation platforms to
autonomously control this type of aircraft. This work leverages ideas from
instrumentation and measurements, machine learning, and optimization fields in
order to develop an autonomous navigation system for a flexible-wing aircraft.
A novel machine learning process based on a guiding search mechanism is
developed to interface real-time measurements of wing-orientation dynamics into
control decisions. This process is realized using an online value iteration
algorithm that decides on two improved and interacting model-free control
strategies in real-time. The first strategy is concerned with achieving the
tracking objectives while the second supports the stability of the system. A
neural network platform that employs adaptive critics is utilized to
approximate the control strategies while approximating the assessments of their
values. An experimental actuation system is utilized to test the validity of
the proposed platform. The experimental results are shown to be aligned with
the stability features of the proposed model-free adaptive learning approach.

degradation in the presence of non-IID client data. A possible direction to
address this issue is forming clusters of clients with roughly IID data. Most
solutions following this direction are iterative and relatively slow, also
prone to convergence issues in discovering underlying cluster formations. We
introduce federated learning with taskonomy (FLT) that generalizes this
direction by learning the task-relatedness between clients for more efficient
federated aggregation of heterogeneous data. In a one-off process, the server
provides the clients with a pretrained (and fine-tunable) encoder to compress
their data into a latent representation, and transmit the signature of their
data back to the server. The server then learns the task-relatedness among
clients via manifold learning, and performs a generalization of federated
averaging. FLT can flexibly handle a generic client relatedness graph, when
there are no explicit clusters of clients, as well as efficiently decompose it
into (disjoint) clusters for clustered federated learning. We demonstrate that
FLT not only outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baselines in non-IID
scenarios but also offers improved fairness across clients.

applications in many different areas including Web search, recommendation, and

machines to understand things that go beyond simple tokens. Many modern
algorithms use learned entity embeddings from these structured representations.
However, building a knowledge graph takes time and effort, hence very costly
and nontrivial. On the other hand, many Web sources describe entities in some
structured format and therefore, finding ways to get them into useful entity
knowledge is advantageous. We propose an approach that processes entity centric
textual knowledge sources to learn entity embeddings and in turn avoids the
need for a traditional knowledge graph. We first extract triples into the new
representation format that does not use traditional complex triple extraction
methods defined by pre-determined relationship labels. Then we learn entity
embeddings through this new type of triples. We show that the embeddings
learned from our approach are: (i) high quality and comparable to a known
knowledge graph-based embeddings and can be used to improve them further, (ii)
better than a contextual language model-based entity embeddings, and (iii) easy
to compute and versatile in domain-specific applications where a knowledge

Analyzing the model proposed in \cite{Mahbub:2019uhl} it is seen that the
horizon mass of the collapsed Hubble patch is larger by $\mathcal{O}(10)$
compared to the usual computation. Moreover, PBHs can be formed from curvature
power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$, peaked at lower values using
numerically favored threshold overdensities. As a result of the generally
larger masses predicted, the peak of the power spectrum can be placed at larger
$k$ modes than that is typical with which potential future constraints on the

problem with exponential complexity in the square of the mean degree. For
undirected graphs, randomised approximation algorithms have nonetheless been
shown to achieve almost linear expected complexity for this problem. Here we
discuss the sequential stub matching for directed graphs and show that this
process can be mould to sample simple digraphs with asymptotically equal
probability. The process starts with an empty edge set and repeatedly adds
edges to it with a certain state-dependent bias until the desired degree
sequence is fulfilled, while avoiding placement of a double edge or self loop.
We show that uniform sampling is achieved in the sparse regime, when the
maximum degree $d_\text{max}$ is asymptotically dominated by $m^{1/4}$, where
$m$ is the number of edges. The proof is based on deriving various
combinatorial estimates related to the number of digraphs with a given directed
degree sequence and controlling concentration of these estimates in large
digraphs. This suggests that the sequential stub matching can be viewed as a
practical algorithm for almost uniform sampling of digraphs, and we show that
this algorithm can be implemented to feature linear expected runtime $O(m)$.

Yet, existing MIO-based approaches from the literature do not leverage the

slow convergence and large optimality gaps. To fill this gap in the literature,
we propose an intuitive flow-based MIO formulation for learning optimal binary

enable the design of interpretable and fair decision trees. Moreover, we show
that our formulation has a stronger linear optimization relaxation than

sum-rate maximization under latency constraints in finite buffer multicell

the transceiver beamforming vectors, the scheduled packet size and the
resources in the frequency and power domains. This problem is motivated by the
observation that multicell MU-MIMO OFDM systems serve multiple quality of

presumes source and target domain data to be simultaneously available during
training. Such an assumption may not hold in practice, as source data is often
inaccessible (e.g., due to privacy reasons). On the contrary, a pre-trained
source model is always considered to be available, even though performing
poorly on target due to the well-known domain shift problem. This translates
into a significant amount of misclassifications, which can be interpreted as
structured noise affecting the inferred target pseudo-labels. In this work, we
cast UDA as a pseudo-label refinery problem in the challenging source-free
scenario. We propose a unified method to tackle adaptive noise filtering and
pseudo-label refinement. A novel Negative Ensemble Learning technique is
devised to specifically address noise in pseudo-labels, by enhancing diversity
in ensemble members with different stochastic (i) input augmentation and (ii)
feedback. In particular, the latter is achieved by leveraging the novel concept
of Disjoint Residual Labels, which allow diverse information to be fed to the
different members. A single target model is eventually trained with the refined
pseudo-labels, which leads to a robust performance on the target domain.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method, named Adaptive
Pseudo-Label Refinement, achieves state-of-the-art performance on major UDA
benchmarks, such as Digit5, PACS, Visda-C, and DomainNet, without using source

inputs, methods contain multiple steps with diverse modules resulting in
complex optimization, and answer spaces in different datasets are vastly
different. To tackle these challenges, we first quantify domain shifts between
popular VQA datasets, in both visual and textual space. To disentangle shifts
between datasets arising from different modalities, we also construct synthetic
shifts in the image and question domains separately. Second, we test the
robustness of different families of VQA methods (classic two-stream,
transformer, and neuro-symbolic methods) to these shifts. Third, we test the
applicability of existing domain adaptation methods and devise a new one to
bridge VQA domain gaps, adjusted to specific VQA models. To emulate the setting
of real-world generalization, we focus on unsupervised domain adaptation and
the open-ended classification task formulation.

standard kernel density estimator. Another one is to adapt a simulation-based
derivative estimation method such as smoothed perturbation analysis or the
likelihood ratio method to obtain a continuous estimator of the cdf, whose
derivative is an unbiased estimator of the density. This can then be combined
with RQMC. We summarize recent theoretical results with these approaches and

super-resolution (SR). Recently, Double-DIP proposes to model the kernel via a
network architecture prior, while KernelGAN employs the deep linear network and
several regularization losses to constrain the kernel space. However, they fail
to fully exploit the general SR kernel assumption that anisotropic Gaussian
kernels are sufficient for image SR. To address this issue, this paper proposes
a normalizing flow-based kernel prior (FKP) for kernel modeling. By learning an
invertible mapping between the anisotropic Gaussian kernel distribution and a
tractable latent distribution, FKP can be easily used to replace the kernel
modeling modules of Double-DIP and KernelGAN. Specifically, FKP optimizes the
kernel in the latent space rather than the network parameter space, which
allows it to generate reasonable kernel initialization, traverse the learned
kernel manifold and improve the optimization stability. Extensive experiments
on synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that the proposed FKP can
significantly improve the kernel estimation accuracy with less parameters,
runtime and memory usage, leading to state-of-the-art blind SR results.

essential enabler for many software engineering activities, such as adaptation.
This involves collecting runtime data from the system so that it is possible to
analyze the collected data to guide actions upon the system. Consequently,
software monitoring imposes practical challenges because it is often done by
intercepting the system execution and recording gathered information. Such
monitoring may degrade the performance and disrupt the system execution to
unacceptable levels. In this paper, we introduce a two-phase monitoring
approach to support the monitoring step in adaptive systems. The first phase
collects lightweight coarse-grained information and identifies relevant parts
of the software that should be monitored in detail based on a provided
domain-specific language. This language is informed by a systematic literature
review. The second phase collects relevant and fine-grained information needed
for deciding whether and how to adapt the managed system. Our approach is
implemented as a framework, called Tigris, that can be seamlessly integrated
into existing software systems to support monitoring-based activities. To
validate our proposal, we instantiated Tigris to support an application-level
caching approach, which adapts caching decisions of a software system at
runtime to improve its performance.

directions (ridge functions). Correspondingly, such functions are difficult to
learn using kernel methods. This observation has motivated the study of
generalizations of kernel methods, whereby the RKHS norm -- which is equivalent
to a weighted $\ell_2$ norm -- is replaced by a weighted functional $\ell_p$
norm, which we refer to as $\mathcal{F}_p$ norm. Unfortunately, tractability of

local thermodynamic phase equilibrium and mixing between the involved species
allow the coexistence of both phases in this pressure range. In this work, a
Volume-of-Fluid method adapted to variable-density real fluids is used to solve
the low-Mach-number governing equations coupled with a thermodynamic model

interface thermodynamics and early deformation of a cool liquid jet composed of
n-decane surrounded by a hotter gas composed of oxygen at 150 bar are analyzed.
Although heat conducts from the hotter gas into the liquid, net condensation
can provide the proper local energy balance at high pressures. Then,
vaporization and condensation may happen simultaneously at different interface
locations. As pressure increases, liquid and gas mixtures become more alike in
the vicinity of the interface. Thus, a combination of low surface tension force
and gas-like liquid viscosities causes an early growth of surface
instabilities. Early results indicate some similarity with high-Weber-number

more compositional steps. Using AGQA, we evaluate modern visual reasoning

Correspondingly, this has changed how scientific and statistical work is
shared. For example, it is now commonplace for underlying analysis code and
data to be proffered alongside journal publications and conference talks.
Unfortunately, sharing code faces several challenges. First, it is often
difficult to take code from one computer and run it on another. Code
configuration, version, and dependency issues often make this challenging.
Secondly, even if the code runs, it is often hard to understand or interact
with the analysis. This makes it difficult to assess the code and its findings,
for example, in a peer review process. In this review we describe the
combination of two computing technologies that help make analyses shareable,
interactive, and completely reproducible. These technologies are (1) analysis
containerization, which leverages virtualization to fully encapsulate analysis,
data, code and dependencies into an interactive and shareable format, and (2)
code notebooks, a literate programming format for interacting with analyses.
The fusion of these two technologies offers significant advantages over using
either individually. This review surveys how the combination enhances the
accessibility and reproducibility of code, analyses, and ideas.

reliance on sophisticated classifiers is not necessary, and a simple classifier
applied directly to improved feature embeddings can instead outperform most of
the leading methods in the literature. To this end, we present a new method
named \textbf{DCAP} for few-shot classification, in which we investigate how
one can improve the quality of embeddings by leveraging \textbf{D}ense
\textbf{C}lassification and \textbf{A}ttentive \textbf{P}ooling. Specifically,
we propose to train a learner on base classes with abundant samples to solve
dense classification problem first and then meta-train the learner on a bunch
of randomly sampled few-shot tasks to adapt it to few-shot scenario or the test
time scenario. During meta-training, we suggest to pool feature maps by
applying attentive pooling instead of the widely used global average pooling
(GAP) to prepare embeddings for few-shot classification. Attentive pooling
learns to reweight local descriptors, explaining what the learner is looking
for as evidence for decision making. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show
the proposed method to be superior in multiple few-shot settings while being
simpler and more explainable. Code is available at:

predecessor (SPTpol) by an order of magnitude increase in detectors on the
focal plane. The technology used to read out and control these detectors,
digital frequency-domain multiplexing (DfMUX), is conceptually the same as used
for SPTpol, but extended to accommodate more detectors. A nearly 5x expansion
in the readout operating bandwidth has enabled the use of this large focal
plane, and SPT-3G performance meets the forecasting targets relevant to its
science objectives. However, the electrical dynamics of the higher-bandwidth
readout differ from predictions based on models of the SPTpol system due to the
higher frequencies used, and parasitic impedances associated with new cryogenic
electronic architecture. To address this, we present an updated derivation for
electrical crosstalk in higher-bandwidth DfMUX systems, and identify two
previously uncharacterized contributions to readout noise, which become
dominant at high bias frequency. The updated crosstalk and noise models
successfully describe the measured crosstalk and readout noise performance of
SPT-3G. These results also suggest specific changes to warm electronics

sometimes mutually destructive, creating regions of parametric spaces where the

very close to the upper bound of the current experimental limits. Those are
ideal areas to study lepton-flavor-violating decays of the standard- model-

the origin of black hole mergers. However, owing to the large number of
harmonics required to compute the amplitude of an eccentric signal, eccentric
templates can be computationally very expensive, making statistical analyses to
distinguish distributions from different formation channels very challenging.
In this paper, we outline a method for estimating the signal-to-noise ratio for
inspiraling binaries at lower frequencies such as those proposed for LISA and
DECIGO. Our approximation can be useful more generally for any quasi-periodic
sources. We argue that surprisingly, the signal-to-noise ratio evaluated at or
near the peak frequency (of the power) is well approximated by using a constant
noise curve, even if in reality the noise strain has power law dependence. We
furthermore improve this initial estimate over our previous calculation to
allow for frequency-dependence in the noise to expand the range of eccentricity
and frequency over which our approximation applies. We show how to apply this
method to get an answer accurate to within a factor of two over almost the
entire projected observable frequency range. We emphasize this method is not a
replacement for detailed signal processing. The utility lies chiefly in
identifying theoretically useful discriminators among different populations and
providing fairly accurate estimates for how well they should work. This
approximation can furthermore be useful for narrowing down parameter ranges in
a computationally economical way when events are observed. We furthermore show
a distinctive way to identify events with extremely high eccentricity where the
signal is enhanced relative to na\""ive expectations on the high frequency end.

mean square error of LASSO in the case of random designs in which each row of
${\bf X}$ is drawn from distribution $N(0,{\mbox{$\Sigma$}})$ with general
${\mbox{$\Sigma$}}$. We first derive the asymptotic risk of LASSO in the limit
of $n,p\rightarrow\infty$ with $n/p\rightarrow\delta$. We then examine
conditions on $n$, $p$, and $k$ for LASSO to exactly reconstruct
${\mbox{$\beta$}}_0$ in the noiseless case ${\bf w}=0$. A phase boundary
$\delta_c=\delta(\epsilon)$ is precisely established in the phase space defined
by $0\le\delta,\epsilon\le 1$, where $\epsilon=k/p$. Above this boundary, LASSO
perfectly recovers ${\mbox{$\beta$}}_0$ with high probability. Below this
boundary, LASSO fails to recover $\mbox{$\beta$}_0$ with high probability.
While the values of the non-zero elements of ${\mbox{$\beta$}}_0$ do not have
any effect on the phase transition curve, our analysis shows that $\delta_c$

methods that are both computationally efficient and theoretically valid. In
terms of computation, the conventional EM algorithm for latent class models
tends to have a slow algorithmic convergence rate for large-scale data and may
converge to some local optima instead of the maximum likelihood estimator(MLE).
Motivated by this, we introduce the tensor decomposition perspective into
latent class analysis with binary responses. Methodologically, we propose to
use a moment-based tensor power method in the first step, and then use the
obtained estimates as initialization for the EM algorithm in the second step.

models by learning generalizable augmentations from sparse data. Building on
recent advances in data-driven turbulence modeling, the present approach,
referred to as Learning and Inference assisted by Feature-space Engineering
(LIFE), is based on the hypothesis that robustness and generalizability demand
a meticulously-designed feature space that is informed by the underlying
physics, and a carefully constructed features-to-augmentation map. The critical
components of this approach are: (1) Maintaining consistency across the
learning and prediction environments; (2) Tightly-coupled inference and
learning by constraining the augmentation to be learnable throughout the
inference process; (3) Identification of relevant physics-informed features in
appropriate functional forms to enable significant overlap in feature space for
a wide variety of cases to promote generalizability; (4) Maintaining explicit
control over feature space to change the augmentation function behavior only in
the vicinity of available datapoints. To demonstrate the viability of this
approach, it is used in the modeling of bypass transition. The augmentation is
developed on skin friction data from two flat plate cases from the ERCOFTAC
dataset. Piecewise linear interpolation on a structured grid in feature-space
is used as a sample functional form for the augmentation to demonstrate the
capability of localized learning. The augmented model is then applied to a
variety of flat plate cases which are characterized by different freestream
turbulence intensities, pressure gradients, and Reynolds numbers. The
predictive capability of the augmented model is also tested on single-stage
high-pressure-turbine cascade cases, and the model performance is analyzed from
the perspective of information contained in the feature space.

attractive two-body interaction and repulsive three-body interaction,
characterized respectively by an $s$-wave scattering length $a<0$ and a
three-body scattering hypervolume $D>0$. It happens when the harmonic trapping
potential is weak, so with increasing temperature the system changes from a
low-temperature liquid-like quantum droplet to a normal gas, and therefore
experiences a first-order liquid-to-gas transition. At large trapping
potential, however, the quantum droplet can first turn into a superfluid gas,
rendering the condensation transition occurred later from a superfluid gas to a
normal gas smooth. We determine a rich phase diagram and show the existence of
a tri-critical point, where the three phases - quantum droplet, superfluid gas

progressively generated in order to simulate various photometric and geometric

invariant representation learning subnetwork, contrastive learning is
introduced to learn the domain invariant representation in which each class is
well clustered so that a better decision boundary can be learned to improve

with. Here, we develop an explicitly likelihood-based variation of the
generalised profiling method as a tool for prediction and inference under model
misspecification. Our approach allows us to carry out identifiability analysis
and uncertainty quantification using profile likelihood-based methods without
the need for marginalisation. We provide justification for this approach by
introducing a new interpretation of the model approximation component as a
stochastic constraint. This preserves the rationale for using profiling rather
than integration to remove nuisance parameters while also providing a link back
to stochastic models. We applied an initial version of this method during an
outbreak of measles in Samoa in 2019-2020 and found that it achieved relatively
fast, accurate predictions. Here we present the most recent version of our
method and its application to this measles outbreak, along with additional
validation.

double quantum dot. Each quantum dot is assumed to be strongly coupled to its
own ferromagnetic lead, while the coupling between the dots is relatively weak.
The current flowing through the system is determined within the perturbation
theory in the hopping between the dots, whereas the spectrum of a quantum
dot-ferromagnetic lead subsystem is determined by means of the numerical
renormalization group method. The spin-dependent charge fluctuations between
ferromagnets and quantum dots generate an effective exchange field, which
splits the double dot levels. Such field can be controlled, separately for each
quantum dot, by the gate voltages or by changing the magnetic configuration of
external leads. We demonstrate that the considered double quantum dot spin
valve setup exhibits enhanced magnetoresistive properties, including both
normal and inverse tunnel magnetoresistance. We also show that this system
allows for the generation of highly spin-polarized currents, which can be
controlled by purely electrical means. The considered double quantum dot with
ferromagnetic contacts can thus serve as an efficient voltage-tunable spin
valve characterized by high output parameters.

of process models from event logs generated by information systems. The
insights revealed from process mining heavily rely on the quality of the event
logs. Activities extracted from different data sources or the free-text nature

would then lead to redundancy in activity labels, which refer to labels that

of these labels from data-driven process discovery are difficult and rely
heavily on human intervention. Neither existing process discovery algorithms
nor event data preprocessing techniques can solve such redundancy efficiently.
In this paper, we propose a multi-view approach to automatically detect
redundant activity labels using not only context-aware features such as
control--flow relations and attribute values but also semantic features from
the event logs. Our evaluation of several publicly available datasets and a
real-life case study demonstrate that our approach can efficiently detect
redundant activity labels even with low-occurrence frequencies. The proposed
approach can add value to the preprocessing step to generate more

  Layer Turbulence","Princeton University PhD thesis, 274 pages",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Understanding turbulent transport physics in the tokamak edge and scrape-off
layer (SOL) is critical to developing a successful fusion reactor. The dynamics
in these regions plays a key role in achieving high fusion performance by
determining the edge pedestal that suppresses turbulence in H-mode.
Additionally, the survivability of a reactor is set by the heat load to the
vessel walls, making it important to understand turbulent spreading of heat as
it flows along open magnetic field lines in the SOL. Large-amplitude
fluctuations, magnetic X-point geometry, and plasma interactions with material
walls make simulating turbulence in the edge/SOL more challenging than in the
core region, necessitating specialized gyrokinetic codes. Further, the
inclusion of electromagnetic effects in gyrokinetic simulations that can handle
the unique challenges of the boundary plasma is critical to the understanding
of phenomena such as the pedestal and ELMs, for which electromagnetic dynamics
are expected to be important.
  In this thesis, we develop the first capability to simulate electromagnetic
gyrokinetic turbulence on open magnetic field lines. This is an important step
towards comprehensive electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations of the coupled
edge/SOL system. By using a continuum full-f approach via an energy-conserving
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization scheme that avoids the Ampere
cancellation problem, we show that electromagnetic fluctuations can be handled
in a robust, stable, and efficient manner in the gyrokinetic module of the
Gkeyll code. We then present results which roughly model the scrape-off layer
of the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX), and show that
electromagnetic effects can affect blob dynamics and transport. We also
formulate the gyrokinetic system in field-aligned coordinates for modeling
realistic edge and scrape-off layer geometries in experiments.

such models do not fit into the memory of accelerator devices, they need to be
partitioned by model parallelism techniques. Moreover, to accelerate training
for huge training data, we need a combination of model and data parallelisms,
i.e., hybrid parallelism. Given a model description for PyTorch without any
specification for model parallelism, RaNNC automatically partitions the model
into a set of subcomponents so that (1) each subcomponent fits a device memory
and (2) a high training throughput for pipeline parallelism is achieved by
balancing the computation times of the subcomponents. In our experiments, we
compared RaNNC with two popular frameworks, Megatron-LM (hybrid parallelism)
and GPipe (originally proposed for model parallelism, but a version allowing
hybrid parallelism also exists), for training models with increasingly greater
numbers of parameters. In the pre-training of enlarged BERT models, RaNNC
successfully trained models five times larger than those Megatron-LM could, and
RaNNC's training throughputs were comparable to Megatron-LM's when pre-training
the same models. RaNNC also achieved better training throughputs than GPipe on
both the enlarged BERT model pre-training (GPipe with hybrid parallelism) and
the enlarged ResNet models (GPipe with model parallelism) in all of the

partitions models without any modification to their descriptions; Megatron-LM

Additionally, a multi-normal selection method based on weights, dubbed as
multi-patch stitching, integrates the normals from the overlapping patches. To
reduce the adverse effects of sharp corners or noise in a patch, we introduce
an adaptive local feature aggregation layer to focus on an anisotropic

mutual influence between underlying piecewise surfaces in a patch. At the
stitching stage, we use the learned weights of multi-branch planar experts and
distance weights between points to select the best normal from the overlapping
parts. Furthermore, we put forward constructing a sparse matrix representation

field solutions. They are distributed in the range of $B\sim (0.16-64.5)\times
10^{10}\,{\rm G}$ and $\sim (0.275-79.0)\times 10^{13}\,{\rm G}$ corresponding
to the low- and high-$B$ solutions respectively. The low magnetic field
solutions correspond to the state that the neutron stars are far away from the
spin equilibrium, and the high magnetic field solutions are close to the spin
equilibrium. The ultra-strong magnetic fields derived in Be-type ULX pulsars
imply that the accretion mode in Be-type ULX pulsars could be more complicated
than in the persistent ULX pulsars and may not be accounted for by the

70\%$ probability of chance coincidence for an AGN flare consistent with the GW
event. We present a Bayesian formalism to estimate the confidence of an AGN
association by analyzing a population of BBH events with dedicated follow-up
observations. Depending on the fraction of BBH arising from AGNs, counterpart
searches of $\mathcal{O}(1)-\mathcal{O}(100)$ GW events are needed to establish
a confident association, and more than an order of magnitude more for searches
without followup (i.e, using only the locations of AGNs and GW events).
Follow-up campaigns of the top $\sim 5\%$ (based on volume localization and
binary mass) of BBH events with total rest frame mass $\ge 50~M_\odot$ are
expected to establish a confident association during the next LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA
observing run (O4), as long as the true value of the fraction of BBH giving
rise to AGN flares is $>0.1$. Our formalism allows us to jointly infer
cosmological parameters from a sample of BBH events that include chance

approaches on point cloud: the poison-label backdoor attack (PointPBA) and the
clean-label backdoor attack (PointCBA). The first one is straightforward and
effective in practice, while the latter is more sophisticated assuming there
are certain data inspections. The attack algorithms are mainly motivated and
developed by 1) the recent discovery of 3D adversarial samples suggesting the

Hilbert spaces involving weight functions, which determine the behaviour as
different variables tend to $\pm \infty$, and weight parameters, which
represent the influence of different subsets of variables. The unanchored ANOVA
space on $\mathbb{R}^d$ was initially introduced by Nichols & Kuo in 2014 to
analyse the error of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approximations for integrals on
unbounded domains; whereas the classical Sobolev space of dominating mixed
smoothness was used as the setting in a series of papers by Griebel, Kuo &
Sloan on the smoothing effect of integration, in an effort to develop a
rigorous theory on why QMC methods work so well for certain non-smooth
integrands with kinks or jumps coming from option pricing problems. In this
same setting, Griewank, Kuo, Le\""ovey & Sloan in 2018 subsequently extended
these ideas by developing a practical smoothing by preintegration technique to
approximate integrals of such functions with kinks or jumps.
  We first prove the equivalence in one dimension (itself a non-trivial task),
before following a similar, but more complicated, strategy to prove the
equivalence for general dimensions. As a consequence of this equivalence, we
analyse applying QMC combined with a preintegration step to approximate the
fair price of an Asian option, and prove that the error of such an
approximation using $N$ points converges at a rate close to $1/N$.

face forgery detection to a new level, we construct a novel large-scale

with an average of three human faces in each frame. The manipulation procedure
is fully automatic, controlled by a domain-adversarial quality assessment

we propose a novel algorithm to tackle the task of multi-person face forgery

multiple instance learning and learns to automatically attend to tampered

In the domain, acoustic scene classification and acoustic event classification
are two closely related tasks. In this letter, a two-stage method is proposed
for the above tasks. In the first stage, a mixup based MTL solution is proposed
to classify both tasks in one single convolutional neural network. Artificial
multi-label samples are used in the training of the MTL model, which are mixed
up using existing single-task datasets. The multi-task model obtained can
effectively recognize both the acoustic scenes and events. Compared with other
methods such as re-annotation or synthesis, the mixup based MTL is low-cost,
flexible and effective. In the second stage, the MTL model is modified into a
single-task model which is fine-tuned using the original dataset corresponding
to the specific task. By controlling the frozen layers carefully, the
task-specific high level features are fused and the performance of the single
classification task is further improved. The proposed method has confirmed the
complementary characteristics of acoustic scene and acoustic event
classifications. Finally, enhanced by ensemble learning, a satisfactory
accuracy of 84.5 percent on TUT acoustic scene 2017 dataset and an accuracy of

graphical primitives defined by algebraic expressions constructed out of
elements of a given generalized Clifford algebra, a graphical primitive
corresponding to the ground state, and also graphical primitives corresponding
to projections onto the ground state of each qudit. We establish many
properties of the graphical calculus using purely algebraic methods, including
a novel algebraic proof of a Yang-Baxter equation and a construction of a
corresponding braid group representation. Our algebraic proof, which applies to
arbitrary qudit dimension, also enables a resolution of an open problem of
Cobanera and Ortiz on the construction of self-dual braid group representations
for even qudit dimension. We also derive several new identities for the braid
elements, which are key to our proofs. In terms of physics, we connect these
braid identities to physics by showing the presence of a conserved charge.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that in many cases, the verification of involved
vector identities can be reduced to the combinatorial application of two basic
vector identities. We show how to explicitly compute various vector states in
an efficient manner using algebraic methods. Additionally, in terms of quantum
computation, we demonstrate that it is feasible to envision implementing the
braid operators for quantum computation, by showing that they are 2-local
operators. In fact, these braid elements are almost Clifford gates, for they
normalize the generalized Pauli group up to an extra factor $\zeta$, which is
an appropriate square root of a primitive root of unity.

and global search are relatively static, thus are still sub-optimal for
improving tracking performance. By further studying the local and global search
results, we raise a question: can we allow more dynamics for cooperating both
results? In this paper, we propose to introduce more dynamics by devising a
dynamic attention-guided multi-trajectory tracking strategy. In particular, we
construct dynamic appearance model that contains multiple target templates,
each of which provides its own attention for locating the target in the new
frame. Guided by different attention, we maintain diversified tracking results
for the target to build multi-trajectory tracking history, allowing more
candidates to represent the true target trajectory. After spanning the whole
sequence, we introduce a multi-trajectory selection network to find the best
trajectory that delivers improved tracking performance. Extensive experimental
results show that our proposed tracking strategy achieves compelling
performance on various large-scale tracking benchmarks. The project page of

Release-3 (EDR3) parallaxes based on $\sim 110,000$ W Ursae Majoris (EW)-type
eclipsing binary systems. EWs cover almost the entire sky and are characterized
by a relatively complete coverage in magnitude and color. They are an excellent
proxy for Galactic main-sequence stars. We derive a $W1$-band Period-Luminosity
relation with a distance accuracy of $7.4\%$, which we use to anchor the Gaia
parallax zero-point. The final, global parallax offsets are $-28.6\pm0.6$
$\mu$as and $-25.4\pm4.0$ $\mu$as (before correction) and $4.2\pm0.5$ $\mu$as
and $4.6\pm3.7$ $\mu$as (after correction) for the five- and six-parameter
solutions, respectively. The total systematic uncertainty is $1.8$ $\mu$as. The
spatial distribution of the parallax offsets shows that the bias in the
corrected Gaia EDR3 parallaxes is less than 10 $\mu$as across $40\%$ of the
sky. Only $15\%$ of the sky is characterized by a parallax offset greater than
30 $\mu$as. Thus, we have provided independent evidence that the parallax
zero-point correction provided by the Gaia team significantly reduces the
prevailing bias. Combined with literature data, we find that the overall Gaia
EDR3 parallax offsets for Galactic stars are $[-20, -30]$ $\mu$as and 4-10
$\mu$as, respectively, before and after correction. For specific regions, an
additional deviation of about 10 $\mu$as is found.

circuits. Usually, the gate electrode has to be placed very close to the
conduction channel, typically a few nanometers, in order to achieve efficient
tunability. However, remote control of a FET device through a gate electrode
placed far away is always highly desired, because it not only reduces the
complexity of device fabrication, but also enables designing novel devices with
new functionalities. Here, a non-local gating effect in graphene using both
near-field optical nano-imaging and electrical transport measurement is
reported. With assistance of absorbed water molecules, the charge density of
graphene can be efficiently tuned by a local-gate placed over 30 {\mu}m away.
The observed non-local gating effect is initially driven by an in-plane
electric field established between graphene regions with different charge
densities due to the quantum capacitance near the Dirac point in graphene. The
nonlocality is further amplified and largely enhanced by absorbed water
molecules through screening the in-plane electric field and expending the
transition length. This research reveals novel non-local phenomenon of Dirac
electrons, and paves the way for designing electronic devices with
remote-control using 2D materials with small density of states.

markets. In such markets, buyers have limited information about the product
quality, but can observe the sellers' reputations which depend on their past
transaction histories and ratings from past buyers. Sellers compete in the same
market through pricing, while considering the impact of their heterogeneous
reputations. We consider sellers with limited as well as unlimited capacities,
which correspond to different practical market scenarios. In the unlimited
seller capacity scenario, buyers prefer the seller with the highest
reputation-price ratio. If the gap between the highest and second highest
seller reputation levels is large enough, then the highest reputation seller
dominates the market as a monopoly. If sellers' reputation levels are
relatively close to each other, then those sellers with relatively high
reputations will survive at the equilibrium, while the remaining relatively low
reputation sellers will get zero market share. In the limited seller capacity
scenario, we further consider two different cases. If each seller can only
serve one buyer, then it is possible for sellers to set their monopoly prices
at the equilibrium while all sellers gain positive market shares; if each
seller can serve multiple buyers, then it is possible for sellers to set
maximum prices at the equilibrium. Simulation results show that the dynamics of
reputations and prices in the longer-term interactions will converge to stable
states, and the initial buyer ratings of the sellers play the critical role in
determining sellers' reputations and prices at the stable state.

steps similar to those observed experimentally for specific parameter sets of
{\alpha},{\Omega} ({\lesssim 0.1}), and {\beta} ({gtrsim 1.0}). Full
suppression of the first lobe of the n=1 step guarantees the presence of a
4{\pi}-periodic Josephson current.In addition, we discuss the range of {\Omega}

even for small {\alpha} ({<0.1}). To observe ""period-doubled Shapiro steps"",
even with a small {\alpha}, the junction should have a large {I_c}{R_N} product
and sufficiently large junction capacitance.

Although great progress has been made on denoising such sequences, existing

tackle the problems in Monte Carlo rendering by proposing a two-stage denoiser
based on the adaptive sampling strategy. In the first stage, concurrent to
adjusting samples per pixel (spp) on-the-fly, we reuse the computations to
generate extra denoising kernels applying on the adaptively rendered image.
Rather than a direct prediction of pixel-wise kernels, we save the overhead
complexity by interpolating such kernels from a public kernel pool, which can
be dynamically updated to fit input signals. In the second stage, we design the
position-aware pooling and semantic alignment operators to improve
spatial-temporal stability. Our method was first benchmarked on 10 synthesized

scenes rendered from our self-built RTX-based renderer. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of both numerical error and visual

to high UAV mobility, intermittent link quality between UAVs, dynamic three

routing approaches have been proposed, none of them so far have addressed inter
UAV coverage, collision and routing in an integrated manner. In this paper, we
consider a scenario where network of UAVs, operating at different heights from
ground, with inter UAV coverage and collision constraints, are sent on a
mission to collect disaster surveillance data and route it to Terrestrial Base
Station via multi-hop UAV path. Analytical expressions for coverage probability

maximum (Rmax) distance between UAVs are empirically calculated. We then
propose a novel Multi-hop Opportunistic 3D Routing (MO3DR) algorithm with inter

magnetic dipole and Gamow-Teller transitions, which provides magnetic
properties of a nuclear system. Purpose: I investigate an isotopic dependence
of the collectivity generated by the spin-dependent interactions in the Ca and
Ni isotopes through the isovector (IV) spin-flip excitations. The responses in
the neutral $(t_z)$ and charge-exchange $(t_{\pm})$ channels are considered in
a unified way. Method: A nuclear energy-density functional approach is employed
for calculating the response functions based on the Skyrme-Kohn-Sham-Bogoliubov
method and the quasiparticle-random-phase approximation (QRPA). I adopt the
like-particle QRPA and the proton-neutron QRPA for the neutral and
charge-exchange channels, respectively. I consider the fluctuation of the
proton-neutron pair fields. Results: The collective shift due to RPA
correlations for the response in the neutral channel is explained by the
occupation probability of neutrons in the $j_>=\ell+1/2$ orbital. Many
particle-hole or two-quasiparticle excitations have a coherent contribution to
form a giant resonance in neutron-rich nuclei for the charge-exchange channel.
The IV spin susceptibility displays the isotopic evolution of the collectivity
and the underlying shell structure. Conclusions: A repulsive character of the
residual interaction in the spin-isospin channel diminishes the IV spin
susceptibility due to the collectivity, while the dynamic ${}^{3}S$ pairing
appearing in the charge-exchange channel opposes the reduction.

elliptic solvers that work efficiently on modern supercomputers. This paper
reports our study of the potential computational savings when using mixed
precision arithmetic in the elliptic solvers. The essential components of a
representative elliptic solver are run at precision levels as low as half (16
bits), and accompanied with a detailed evaluation of the impact of reduced
precision on the solver convergence and the solution quality.
  A detailed inquiry into reduced precision requires a model configuration that
is meaningful but cheaper to run and easier to evaluate than full
atmosphere/ocean models. This study is therefore conducted in the context of a
novel semi-implicit shallow-water model on the sphere, purposely designed to
mimic numerical intricacies of modern all-scale weather and climate (W&C)
models with the numerical stability independent on celerity of all wave
motions. The governing algorithm of the shallow-water model is based on the
non-oscillatory MPDATA methods for geophysical flows, whereas the resulting
elliptic problem employs a strongly preconditioned non-symmetric
Krylov-subspace solver GCR, proven in advanced atmospheric applications. The
classical longitude/latitude grid is deliberately chosen to retain the
stiffness of global W&C models posed in thin spherical shells as well as to
better understand the performance of reduced-precision arithmetic in the
vicinity of grid singularities. Precision reduction is done on a software
level, using an emulator. The reduced-precision experiments are conducted for
established dynamical-core test-cases, like the Rossby-Haurwitz wave number 4
and a zonal orographic flow.
  The study shows that selected key components of the elliptic solver, most
prominently the preconditioning, can be performed at the level of half
precision.

propose a fully automated spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis method, which can

non-linear regression analysis. Specifically, in our approach, the analyzed
spectral region is gradually expanded toward higher energy while incorporating
an additional optical transition peak whenever the root-mean-square error of
the fitting analysis exceeds a critical value. In particular, we have
established a unique algorithm that could be employed for the ellipsometry
analyses of different types of optical materials. The proposed scheme has been
applied successfully for the analyses of MoOx transparent oxides and the
complex dielectric function of a MoOx layer that exhibits dual optical

magnetic field splits the spatial-confinement-induced atomic-like shell states

confinement occurs and the atomic-like shell states condense into Landau levels

the spatial confinement dramatically changes the energy spacing between the LLs

LLs. These results shed light on puzzling observations in previous experiments,

absence of a superconducting phase in certain moire flat bands raises a
question on the superconducting mechanism. In this work, we investigate
electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling in graphene moire

MA-TTG, both of which display robust superconductivity in experiments. However,
lambda is an order of magnitude smaller in twisted double bilayer graphene

a wide mass range in a unified manner is desirable not only for understanding
exotic nuclei but for providing nuclear data for applications. Purpose: We
demonstrate the KIDS functional describes the ground states appropriately with
respect to the existing data and predictions for a possible application of the
functional to all the nuclei by taking Nd isotopes as examples. Method: The
Kohn-Sham-Bogoliubov equation is solved for the Nd isotopes with the neutron
numbers ranging from 60 to 160 by employing the KIDS functionals constructed to
satisfy both neutron-matter equation of state or neutron star observation and
selected nuclear data. Results: Considering the nuclear deformation improves
the description of the binding energies and radii. We find that the discrepancy
from the experimental data is more significant for neutron-rich/deficient
isotopes and this can be made isotope independent by changing the slope
parameter of the symmetry energy. Conclusions: The KIDS functional is applied
to the mid-shell nuclei for the first time. The onset and evolution of
deformation are nicely described for the Nd isotopes. The KIDS functional is
competent to a global fitting for a better description of nuclear properties in
the nuclear chart.

for a centroid set an inverted-file that is structured so as to reduce pipeline

space is becoming more and more crowded and complex. This makes it a

ecosystem, and leveraging the analogy to the natural ecosystem in biology, a
novel symbiotic communication (SC) paradigm is proposed through which the
relevant radio systems, called symbiotic radios (SRs), in a radio ecosystem
form a symbiotic relationship (e.g., mutualistic symbiosis) through intelligent
resource/service exchange. Radio resources include, e.g., spectrum, energy, and
infrastructure, while typical radio services are communicating, relaying, and
computing. The symbiotic relationship can be realized via either symbiotic
coevolution or symbiotic synthesis. In symbiotic coevolution, each SR is
empowered with an evolutionary cycle alongside the multi-agent learning, while
in symbiotic synthesis, the SRs ingeniously optimize their operating parameters
and transmission protocols by solving a multi-objective optimization problem.
Promisingly, the proposed SC paradigm breaks the boundary of radio systems,
thus providing us a fresh perspective on radio resource management and new

determining the criticality of magnetic support against gravitational collapse.
In this paper, as part of the JCMT BISTRO survey, we suggest a new application
of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method to estimate the distribution of
magnetic field strengths in the OMC-1 region. We use observations of dust
polarization emission at 450 $\mu$m and 850 $\mu$m, and C$^{18}$O (3-2)
spectral line data obtained with the JCMT. We estimate the volume density, the
velocity dispersion and the polarization angle dispersion in a box, 40$''$
$\times$ 40$''$ (5$\times$5 pixels), which moves over the OMC-1 region. By
substituting three quantities in each box to the DCF method, we get magnetic
field strengths over the OMC-1 region. We note that there are very large
uncertainties in inferred field strengths, as discussed in detail in this
paper. The field strengths vary from 0.8 to 26.4 mG and their mean value is
about 6 mG. Additionally, we obtain maps of the mass-to-flux ratio in units of
a critical value and the Alfv$\acute{e}$n mach number. The central parts of the
BN-KL and South (S) clumps in the OMC-1 region are magnetically supercritical,
so the magnetic field cannot support the clumps against gravitational collapse.
However, the outer parts of the region are magnetically subcritical. The mean
Alfv$\acute{e}$n mach number is about 0.4 over the region, which implies that
the magnetic pressure exceeds the turbulent pressure in the OMC 1 region.

the issue, we present a novel class-aware robust adversarial training paradigm
for the object detection task. For a given image, the proposed approach
generates an universal adversarial perturbation to simultaneously attack all

number of objects, the proposed approach decomposes the total loss into
class-wise losses and normalizes each class loss using the number of objects
for the class. The adversarial training based on the class weighted loss can
not only balances the influence of each class but also effectively and evenly
improves the adversarial robustness of trained models for all the object
classes as compared with the previous defense methods. Furthermore, with the
recent development of fast adversarial training, we provide a fast version of
the proposed algorithm which can be trained faster than the traditional
adversarial training while keeping comparable performance. With extensive

Direction Method of Multipliers (SAS-ADMM) for solving separable convex
optimization problems with linear constraints. The objective function is the
sum of a possibly nonsmooth convex function and an average function of many
smooth convex functions. Our proposed algorithm combines both ideas of ADMM and
the techniques of accelerated stochastic gradient methods possibly with
variance reduction to solve the smooth subproblem. One main feature of SAS-ADMM
is that its dual variable is symmetrically updated after each update of the
separated primal variable, which would allow a more flexible and larger
convergence region of the dual variable compared with that of standard
deter-ministic or stochastic ADMM. This new stochastic optimization algorithm
is shown to have ergodic converge in expectation with O(1/T) convergence rate,
where T is the number of outer iterations. Our preliminary experiments indicate
the proposed algorithm is very effective for solving separable optimization
problems from big-data applications. Finally, 3-block extensions of the
algorithm and its variant of an accelerated stochastic augmented Lagrangian

localization, these features cannot distinguish the frequently co-occurring

term this challenge action-context confusion, and it will adversely affect the
action localization accuracy. To address this challenge, we introduce a
framework that learns two feature subspaces respectively for actions and their
context. By explicitly accounting for action visual elements, the action
instances can be localized more precisely without the distraction from the
context. To facilitate the learning of these two feature subspaces with only
video-level categorical labels, we leverage the predictions from both spatial

tool for studying the continuously obtainable information on discontinuous
functions.
  To any function $f \colon X \to Y$ between $\operatorname{qcb}_0$-spaces one
can assign a so-called universal envelope which, in a well-defined sense,
encodes all continuously obtainable information on the function. A universal
envelope consists of two continuous functions $F \colon X \to L$ and $\xi_L
\colon Y \to L$ with values in a $\Sigma$-split injective space $L$. Any
continuous function with values in an injective space whose composition with
the original function is again continuous factors through the universal
envelope. However, it is not possible in general to uniformly compute this
factorisation.
  In this paper we propose the notion of uniform envelopes. A uniform envelope
is additionally endowed with a map $u_L \colon L \to \mathcal{O}^2(Y)$ that is
compatible with the multiplication of the double powerspace monad
$\mathcal{O}^2$ in a certain sense. This yields for every continuous map with
values in an injective space a choice of uniformly computable extension. Under
a suitable condition which we call uniform universality, this extension yields
a uniformly computable solution for the above factorisation problem.
  Uniform envelopes can be endowed with a composition operation. We establish
criteria that ensure that the composition of two uniformly universal envelopes
is again uniformly universal. These criteria admit a partial converse and we
provide evidence that they cannot be easily improved in general.
  Not every function admits a uniformly universal uniform envelope. We can
however assign to every function a canonical envelope that is in some sense as
close as possible to a uniform envelope. We obtain a composition theorem
similar to the uniform case.

space are compared: Bernstein polynomials, Lagrangian polynomials on equispaced

choice, we only consider inexact quadrature based on the formulas corresponding
to the degrees of freedom of the element, which allows to obtain a fully
diagonal mass matrix. We also compare different time stepping strategies,
namely Runge-Kutta (RK), strong stability preserving RK (SSPRK) and deferred
correction time integration methods. The latter allows to alleviate the
computational cost as the mass matrix inversion is replaced by the high order
correction iterations. To understand the effects of these choices, both
time-continuous and fully discrete Fourier analysis are performed. These allow
to compare all the different combinations in terms of accuracy and stability,
as well as to provide suggestions for optimal values discretization parameters

data adaptive FDR control in this transformational sparsity setting, the Split
Knockoff method. The proposed scheme exploits both variable and data splitting.
By variable splitting, the linear transformation constraint is relaxed to its
Euclidean proximity in a lifted parameter space, yielding an orthogonal design
for improved power and orthogonal Split Knockoff copies. Moreover, by randomly
splitting the data into two independent subsets, new knockoff statistics are
generated with signs as independent Bernoulli random variables, enabling
inverse supermartingale constructions for provable FDR control. Simulation

Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole. The key ingredient is that the black hole is
assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath of an arbitrary
temperature and so the generalized entropy is treated as being off-shell.
Taking the on-shell condition to the off-shell generalized entropy, we find the
generalized entropy and then obtain the entanglement entropy following the
island rule. For the non-extremal black hole, the entanglement entropy grows
linearly in time and can be saturated after the Page time as expected. The
entanglement entropy also has a well-defined Schwarzschild limit. In the
extremal black hole, the island prescription provides a logarithmically growing
entanglement entropy in time and a constant entanglement entropy after the Page
time. In the extremal black hole, the boundary of the island hits the curvature
singularity where the semi-classical approximations appear invalid. To avoid
encountering the curvature singularity, we apply this procedure to the Hayward
black hole regular at the origin. Consequently, the presence of the island in
extremal black holes can provide a finite entanglement entropy, which might
imply non-trivial vacuum configurations of extremal black holes.

of light and matter formed by the strong coupling between molecular electronic
or vibrational excitations and an optical cavity, can substantially modify the
physical and chemical properties of molecular systems. Here, we show that, by
exploiting the collective character of molecular polaritons in conjunction with
the effect of polaron decoupling, i.e., the suppression of environmental
influence on the polariton, a superreaction can be realized, involving a
collective enhancement of charge or excitation-energy transfer reaction rate in
a system of donors all coupled to a common acceptor. This effect is analogous
to the phenomenon of superradiation. Since the polariton is a superposition
state of excitations of all the molecules coupled to the cavity, it is
vulnerable to the effect of decoherence caused by energy fluctuations in
molecular systems. Consequently, in the absence of a strong light-matter
interaction, the reaction rate decreases significantly as the number of
molecules increases, even if the system starts from the polariton state. By
turning on the light-matter interaction, the dynamic behavior of the system
changes dramatically, and the reaction rate increases with the number of
molecules, as expected for a superreaction. The underlying mechanism is shown
to be the enhancement of quantum coherence between different donors as the
light-matter interaction becomes stronger.

seen and unseen classes, when only the labeled examples from seen classes are
provided. Recent feature generation methods learn a generative model that can
synthesize the missing visual features of unseen classes to mitigate the
data-imbalance problem in GZSL. However, the original visual feature space is
suboptimal for GZSL classification since it lacks discriminative information.
To tackle this issue, we propose to integrate the generation model with the
embedding model, yielding a hybrid GZSL framework. The hybrid GZSL approach
maps both the real and the synthetic samples produced by the generation model
into an embedding space, where we perform the final GZSL classification.
Specifically, we propose a contrastive embedding (CE) for our hybrid GZSL
framework. The proposed contrastive embedding can leverage not only the
class-wise supervision but also the instance-wise supervision, where the latter
is usually neglected by existing GZSL researches. We evaluate our proposed
hybrid GZSL framework with contrastive embedding, named CE-GZSL, on five
benchmark datasets. The results show that our CEGZSL method can outperform the
state-of-the-arts by a significant margin on three datasets. Our codes are

machine-type communication. Recently, group testing based approaches have been
studied to handle sparse activity detection in massive random access problems.
In this paper, a non-adaptive group testing strategy is proposed which can take
into account the energy constraints on different sensor clusters. A theoretical
extension of the existing randomized group testing strategies to the case of
multiple clusters is presented and the necessary constraints that the optimal
sampling parameters should satisfy in order to improve the efficiency of group
tests is established. The cases of fixed activity pattern where there is a
fixed set of active sensors and random activity pattern where each sensor can
be independently active with certain probability are examined. The theoretical
results are verified and validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. In massive
wireless sensor networks comprising of devices with different energy
efficiencies, our proposed low-power-use mode of access can potentially extend
the lifetime of battery powered sensors with finite energy budget.

we find some points worth studying in current paradigm: 1) Existing methods
mostly ignore the context information among tracklets and intra-frame
detections, which makes the tracker hard to survive in challenging cases like
severe occlusion. 2) The end-to-end association methods solely rely on the data
fitting power of deep neural networks, while they hardly utilize the advantage
of optimization-based assignment methods. 3) The graph-based optimization
methods mostly utilize a separate neural network to extract features, which
brings the inconsistency between training and inference. Therefore, in this
paper we propose a novel learnable graph matching method to address these
issues. Briefly speaking, we model the relationships between tracklets and the
intra-frame detections as a general undirected graph. Then the association
problem turns into a general graph matching between tracklet graph and
detection graph. Furthermore, to make the optimization end-to-end
differentiable, we relax the original graph matching into continuous quadratic

if the resistor analogy can be employed. It is further shown that it is
impossible to incorporate finite cycles into a polymer network such that
individual network strands are at equilibrium conformations while maintaining
simultaneously a force balance at the junctions. Therefore, the resistor
analogy provides only an approximation for the phantom modulus of networks
containing finite loops. Improved approaches to phantom modulus can be
constructed from considering a force balance at the junctions, which requires
knowledge of the distribution of cross-link fluctuations in imperfect networks.
Assuming loops with equilibrium conformations and a force balance at all loop
junctions, a lower bound estimate for the phantom modulus,
$G_{\text{ph}}\approx\left(\xi-c_{\text{f}}L_{1}\right)kT/V$ is obtained within
the ILGA for end-linked model networks and in the limit of $L_{1}\ll\xi$. Here,
$L_{1}$ is the number of primary (""pending"") loops, $\xi$ the cycle rank of the

occurs at the photosphere more frequently than previously thought.
  Aims. In order to understand the energy release by reconnection driven by
flux cancellation, we previously studied a simple model of two cancelling
polarities of equal flux. Here, we further develop our analysis to achieve a
more general setup where the two cancelling polarities have unequal magnetic
fluxes and where many new features are revealed.
  Methods. We carried out an analytical study of the cancellation of two
magnetic fragments of unequal and opposite flux that approach one another and
are located in an overlying horizontal magnetic field.
  Results. The energy release as microflares and nanoflares occurs in two main
phases. During phase 1a, a separator is formed and reconnection is driven at it
as it rises to a maximum height and then moves back down to the photosphere,
heating the plasma and accelerating plasma jets in the process. During phase
1b, once the separator moves back to the photosphere, it bifurcates into two
null points. Reconnection is no longer driven at the separator and an isolated
magnetic domain connecting the two polarities is formed. During phase 2, the
polarities cancel out at the photosphere as magnetic flux submerges below the
photosphere and as reconnection occurs at and above the photosphere and plasma
jets and a mini-filament eruption can be produced.

April and the 28th of May 2020. These two events were subsequently also
observed in situ by BepiColombo and Wind around a day later. We attempt to
reconstruct the observed in situ magnetic field measurements for all three
spacecraft simultaneously using an empirical magnetic flux rope model. This
allows us to test the validity of our flux rope model on a larger and more
global scale and allows for cross-validation of the analysis with different
spacecraft combinations. Finally, we can also compare the results from the in
situ modeling to remote observations obtained from the STEREO-A heliospheric
imagers. We make use of the 3D coronal rope ejection model in order to simulate
the ICME evolution. We adapt a previously developed ABC-SMC fitting algorithm
for the application to multi point scenarios. We show that we are able to
generally reconstruct the flux ropes signatures at three different spacecraft
positions simultaneously using our model in combination with the flux rope
fitting algorithm. For the well-behaved 19th of April ICME our approach works
very well. The 28th of May ICME, on the other hand, shows the limitations of
our approach. Unfortunately, the usage of multi-point observations for these
events does not appear to solve inherent issues, such as the estimation of the
magnetic field twist or flux rope aspect-ratios due to the specific
constellation of the spacecraft positions. As our general approach can be used

and curriculum delivery have significantly contributed to suitability under
COVID19. At the micro level, multiple relationships were noted between EI
characteristics and the suitability of EI under the pandemic across students
characteristics. The study has successfully demonstrated how choice
characteristics can be executed to regulate the suitability of EI under the
COVID19 pandemic for the inclusion of diversity. It is useful for policy makers

This study is the first to provide insights into the performance of choice
characteristics and their relationship with the suitability of EIs under a
pandemic and can be a yardstick in administering new enrollments.

observation that rasterising a pixel in an image given parameters of a

and then relaxed to allow the primitive's parameters to be learned. This
relaxation allows end-to-end differentiable programs and deep networks to be
learned and optimised and provides several building blocks that allow control
over how a compositional drawing process is modelled. We emphasise the
bottom-up nature of our proposed approach, which allows for drawing operations
to be composed in ways that can mimic the physical reality of drawing rather
than being tied to, for example, approaches in modern computer graphics. With
the proposed approach we demonstrate how sketches can be generated by directly
optimising against photographs and how auto-encoders can be built to transform
rasterised handwritten digits into vectors without supervision. Extensive
experimental results highlight the power of this approach under different

storage rings via charge-exchange injection. In this process, the two electrons
are stripped by a foil or laser to produce protons which can be merged with an
existing beam without significantly affecting its dynamics, allowing high
intensities of protons to be accumulated. However, this capability comes with
the drawback that the outer electron of an H$^-$ ion has a low binding energy
and can easily be stripped away prior to injection. This paper addresses the
following stripping mechanisms: interactions with residual gas in the beam
pipe, blackbody radiation from accelerator components, and electromagnetic
fields from accelerator optics (Lorentz-force stripping) and particles within
the bunch itself (intrabeam stripping); with a discussion on how to avoid
excessive activation from stripped H$^0$ particles and protons. We also
demonstrate that the proportion of stripped H$^0$ colliding with a nearby beam
pipe or machine-element walls presents only roughly 10\% of those lost in
stripping; the remaining stripped particles traverse to the end of a linac or
local straight section, which may relax the limits for allowable
stripping-based beam loss in H$^-$ accelerators.

Formulaic alphas are simple algebraic expressions of scalar features, and thus

alphas are data-driven models over vector and matrix features. They are more
predictive than formulaic alphas, but are too complex to mine into a weakly

Although fairly simple mechanically, from the control viewpoint the knuckle

it is possible to control the three rotations of the crane (known as luff,

measuring Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in a sample of 19 long GRBs

results are incompatible with non-stationary jets having Gaussian profiles, and
that $\gtrsim\!100$ GRBs with observed afterglows would be needed to confirm
the potential existence of the angle-variability anti-correlation with
$3\sigma$ significance. If the connection is real, GRB jet angles would be
constrainable from prompt gamma light curves, without the need of afterglow
observations.

the discreteness of coding schemes, which requires either 1) imposing strict
constraints on flow models that degrades the performance or 2) coding numerous
bijective mapping errors which reduces the efficiency. In this paper, we
investigate volume preserving flows for lossless compression and show that a
bijective mapping without error is possible. We propose Numerical Invertible
Volume Preserving Flow (iVPF) which is derived from the general volume
preserving flows. By introducing novel computation algorithms on flow models,
an exact bijective mapping is achieved without any numerical error. We also
propose a lossless compression algorithm based on iVPF. Experiments on various
datasets show that the algorithm based on iVPF achieves state-of-the-art
compression ratio over lightweight compression algorithms.

by the accuracy of the mass calibration, i.e. the empirical determination of
the mapping between cluster selection observables and halo mass. In this work
we demonstrate a method to quantitatively determine the bias and uncertainties
in weak-lensing mass calibration. To this end, we extract a library of
projected matter density profiles from hydrodynamical simulations. Accounting
for shear bias and noise, photometric redshift uncertainties, mis-centering,
cluster member contamination, cluster morphological diversity, and
line-of-sight projections, we produce a library of shear profiles. Fitting a
one-parameter model to these profiles, we extract the so-called \emph{weak
lensing mass} $M_\text{WL}$. Relating the weak-lensing mass to the halo mass
from gravity-only simulations with the same initial conditions as the
hydrodynamical simulations allows us to estimate the impact of hydrodynamical
effects on cluster number counts experiments. Creating new shear libraries for
$\sim$1000 different realizations of the systematics, provides a distribution
of the parameters of the weak-lensing to halo mass relation, reflecting their
systematic uncertainty. This result can be used as a prior for cosmological
inference. We also discuss the impact of the inner fitting radius on the
accuracy, and determine the outer fitting radius necessary to exclude the
signal from neighboring structures. Our method is currently being applied to
different Stage~III lensing surveys, and can easily be extended to Stage~IV
lensing surveys.

To tackle this issue, the basic tool used by specialists is the Polysomnogram,

recording, the specialists have to score the different signals according to one
of the standard guidelines. This process is carried out manually, which can be
highly time-consuming and very prone to annotation errors. Therefore, over the
years, many approaches have been explored in an attempt to support the
specialists in this task. In this paper, an approach based on convolutional
neural networks is presented, where an in-depth comparison is performed in
order to determine the convenience of using more than one signal simultaneously
as input. Additionally, the models were also used as parts of an ensemble model
to check whether any useful information can be extracted from signal processing
a single signal at a time which the dual-signal model cannot identify. Tests
have been performed by using a well-known dataset called expanded sleep-EDF,
which is the most commonly used dataset as the benchmark for this problem. The
tests were carried out with a leave-one-out cross-validation over the patients,
which ensures that there is no possible contamination between training and

model in four dimensions and in the presence of mass-degenerate fundamental
quark flavors, as a natural extension of an earlier investigation in the
quenched approximation. In principle, the proper account of chiral symmetry
breaking ($\chi$SB) and the corresponding dynamical generation of a quark mass
function within the CF model requires one to go beyond perturbation theory
\cite{Pelaez:2020ups}. However, it is interesting to assess whether a
perturbative description applies to correlation functions that are not directly
sensitive to $\chi$SB, such as the gluon, ghost and quark dressing functions.
We compare our two-loop results for these form factors to QCD lattice data in
the two flavor case for two different values of the pion mass, one that is
relatively far from the chiral limit, and one that is closer to the physical
value. Our results confirm that the QCD gluon and ghost dressing functions are
well described by a perturbative approach within the CF model, as already
observed at one-loop order in Ref. \cite{Pelaez:2014mxa}. Our new main result
is that the quark dressing function is also well captured by the perturbative
approach, but only starting at two-loop order, as also anticipated in Ref.
\cite{Pelaez:2014mxa}. The quark mass function predicted by the CF model at
two-loop order is in good agreement with the data if the quarks are not too
light but shows some clear tension with respect to the two-loop CF dressing
functions in the close to physical case, as expected. Interestingly, however,
we find that there is much less tension between the non-perturbative quark mass
function, as it can be obtained from lattice simulations or from
\cite{Pelaez:2020ups}, and the two-loop CF dressing functions, which confirms
the perturbative nature of the latter.

precession frequencies of polarized $^{129}$Xe and $^{3}$He, a new upper limit

developed for the simulation of interfacial flows, including those with
turbulence and primary spray atomisation. The EVD model is derived by volume
averaging the VoF equations over a physically-defined length scale. This
introduces unclosed sub-volume flux, sub-volume stress and volume averaged
surface tension force. Sub-volume fluctuations arise due to both turbulent
motions and other interface dynamics which can, in general, occur in both
laminar and turbulent flows. Both of these types of fluctuations are attenuated
by the volume averaging process. The sub-volume flux is closed by a gradient
diffusion model and involves an explicit volume diffusion coefficient that is
linked to the physical length scale. The sub-volume stress closure introduces
an explicit volume viscosity augmented by turbulent viscosity in turbulent
flows. The volume averaged surface tension force closure is based on fractal
properties of wrinkled sub-volume interfaces. These closures are evaluated
through a priori analysis of resolved flow simulations for a series of
two-dimensional laminar and three-dimensional turbulent interfacial shear
flows. Subsequently, full EVD simulations are validated for these shear flows
and for a laboratory airblast spray jet. Numerical convergence is demonstrated
by keeping the physical length scale constant while reducing the numerical grid
size so that numerical diffusion diminishes and becomes overwhelmed by the
explicit volume diffusion. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted for
variations in the physical length scale, which is compared to the boundary
layer thickness on the light fluid side of the interface.

is shown that the compression of entangled rings can be explained by the
changes in the penetrable fraction of the minimal surface bounded by the ring.
Corrections for small rings can be approximated by a concatenation probability
$1-P_{OO}$ that a ring entraps at least one other ring. Both results are in
line with a previous work [1] to explain the compression of entangled rings in
monodisperse melts. Bond-bond correlations in melts of interpenetrating rings
lead to similar corrections for ring sizes as reported previously [2] for
monodisperse linear melts. For entangled rings, bond-bond correlations show an
anti-correlation peak at a curvilinear distance of about ten segments that
coincides with a horizontal tangent in the normalized mean square internal
distances along the ring. Both observations become independent of melt
molecular weight for sufficiently large degrees of polymerization and such
behavior is not found in samples with entanglements switched off. In
consequence, the length scale of topological interactions (entanglement length)
in a melt of entangled rings must be considered as constant in contrast to a

in autonomous driving, while accurate 3D object detection from this kind of
data is very challenging. In this work, by intensive diagnosis experiments, we
quantify the impact introduced by each sub-task and found the `localization
error' is the vital factor in restricting monocular 3D detection. Besides, we
also investigate the underlying reasons behind localization errors, analyze the
issues they might bring, and propose three strategies. First, we revisit the
misalignment between the center of the 2D bounding box and the projected center
of the 3D object, which is a vital factor leading to low localization accuracy.
Second, we observe that accurately localizing distant objects with existing
technologies is almost impossible, while those samples will mislead the learned
network. To this end, we propose to remove such samples from the training set
for improving the overall performance of the detector. Lastly, we also propose
a novel 3D IoU oriented loss for the size estimation of the object, which is
not affected by `localization error'. We conduct extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset, where the proposed method achieves real-time detection and
outperforms previous methods by a large margin. The code will be made available

Image corruption types have different characteristics in the frequency spectrum

unique insights into the catastrophic break-up of differentiated asteroids.
However, the enigmatic formation process and the poorly constrained timing of
metal-silicate mixing complicate the assignment to potential parent bodies.
Here we report high-precision uranium-lead dating of mesosiderite zircons by

formation 4,558.5 +/- 2.1 million years ago and metal-silicate mixing at

phantom model can be used to describe the monomer fluctuations, average RBOs,
and the distribution of RBOs in networks without entanglements and without

observed in both mono-disperse and poly-disperse entangled networks, while for
all networks without entanglements an RBO $\propto N^{-1}$ is found. The

We
confirm earlier results that loops formed by intersections of infinite strings
formed from random-field initial conditions disappear quickly, with lifetime
proportional to their initial rest-frame length $\ell_\text{init}$. We study a
population with $\ell_\text{init}$ up to $6000$ inverse mass units, and measure
the proportionality constant to be $0.14\pm0.04$, independently of the initial
lengths. We propose a new method to construct oscillating non-self intersecting
loops from initially stationary strings, and show that by contrast these loops
have lifetimes scaling approximately as $\ell_\text{init}^2$, in line with
previous works on artificially created string configurations. We show that the
oscillating strings have mean-square velocity $\bar{v}^2 \simeq 0.500 \pm
0.004$, consistent with the Nambu-Goto value of $1/2$, while the network loops
have $\bar{v}^2 \simeq 0.40 \pm 0.04$. We argue that whatever the mechanism
behind the network loop decay is, it is non-linear, can only be suppressed by
careful tuning of initial conditions, and is much stronger than gravitational
radiation. An implication is that one cannot use the Nambu-Goto model to derive
robust constraints on the tension of field theory strings. We advocate
parametrising the uncertainty as the fraction $f_\text{NG}$ of Nambu-Goto-like
loops surviving to radiate gravitationally. None of the 31 large network loops
created survived longer than 0.25 of their initial length, so one can estimate
that $f_\text{NG}<0.1$ at $95$% confidence level. If the recently reported
NANOgrav signal is due to cosmic strings, $f_\text{NG}$ must be greater than
$10^{-3}$ in order not to violate bounds from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

on higher order space-time finite element discretizations, for the simulation
of the nonstationary, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on evolving
domains. The physical domain is embedded into a fixed computational mesh such
that arbitrary intersections of the moving domain's boundaries with the
background mesh occur. The potential of such cut finite element techniques for
higher order space-time finite element methods has rarely been studied in the
literature so far and deserves further elucidation. The key ingredients of the
approach are the weak formulation of Dirichlet boundary conditions by Nitsche's
method, the flexible and efficient integration over all types of intersections
of cells by moving boundaries and the spatial extension of the discrete
physical quantities to the entire computational background mesh including
fictitious (ghost) subdomains of fluid flow. Thereby, an expensive remeshing
and adaptation of the sparse matrix data structure are avoided and the
computations are accelerated. To prevent spurious oscillations caused by
irregular intersections of mesh cells, a penalization, defining also implicitly
the extension to ghost domains, is added. These techniques are embedded in an
arbitrary order, discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the time variable and
an inf-sup stable discretization of the spatial variables. The parallel
implementation of the matrix assembly is described. The optimal order
convergence properties of the algorithm are illustrated in a numerical
experiment for an evolving domain. The well-known 2d benchmark of flow around a
cylinder as well as flow around moving obstacles with arising cut cells and
fictitious domains are considered further.

biomarkers, repeatedly measured over time, has received much attention over the
last decades. Two contrasting approaches have become in widespread use. The
first is joint modelling, which attempts to jointly model the longitudinal
markers and the event time. The second is landmarking, a more pragmatic
approach that avoids modelling the marker process. Landmarking has been shown
to be less efficient than correctly specified joint models in simulation
studies, when data are generated from the joint model. When the mean model is
misspecified, however, simulation has shown that joint models may be inferior
to landmarking.
  The objective of this paper is to develop methods that improve the predictive
accuracy of landmarking, while retaining its relative simplicity and
robustness. We start by fitting a working longitudinal model for the biomarker,
including a temporal correlation structure. Based on that model, we derive a
predictable time-dependent process representing the expected value of the
biomarker after the landmark time, and we fit a time-dependent Cox model based
on the predictable time-dependent covariate. Dynamic predictions based on this
approach for new patients can be obtained by first deriving the expected values
of the biomarker, given the measured values before the landmark time point, and
then calculating the predicted probabilities based on the time-dependent Cox
model.
  We illustrate the approach in predicting overall survival in liver cirrhosis
patients based on prothrombin index.

find that network defects in $A$ networks are dominated by short dangling loops
close to overlap concentration $c^{*}$. $AB$ networks develop a more perfect
network structure, since loop sizes involving an odd number of stars are
impossible, and thus, the most frequent dangling loop with largest impact on
the phantom modulus is absent. The analysis of the pair-correlation and
scattering function reveals that there is an amorphous packing of $A$ and $B$
type stars with a homogenization of $A$ and $B$ concentrations upon
cross-linking at intermediate length scales in contrast to the previously
suggested crystalline like order of $A$ and $B$ components at $c^{*}$. This
result is corroborated by the coincidence of the probabilities of the shortest

stars) in both types of networks.

The recent success of image-to-image (I2I) translation in computer vision
applications and its growing use in biomedical areas provide a tempting
possibility of transforming the multimodal registration problem into a,
potentially easier, monomodal one. We conduct an empirical study of the
applicability of modern I2I translation methods for the task of rigid
registration of multimodal biomedical and medical 2D and 3D images. We compare
the performance of four Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based I2I
translation methods and one contrastive representation learning method,
subsequently combined with two representative monomodal registration methods,
to judge the effectiveness of modality translation for multimodal image
registration. We evaluate these method combinations on four publicly available
multimodal (2D and 3D) datasets and compare them with the performance of
registration achieved by several well-known approaches acting directly on
multimodal image data. Our results suggest that, although I2I translation may
be helpful when the modalities to register are clearly correlated, registration
of modalities which express distinctly different properties of the sample is
not well handled by the I2I translation approach. The evaluated representation
learning method, which aims to find abstract image-like representations of the

$f$-functional molecules is developed, which contains the formation of short
cyclic structures inside the network. The predictions of this model are
compared with Monte-Carlo simulations of cross-linking of star polymers in
solution. We find that homo-polymerizations are well captured by mean-field
models at concentrations larger than one quarter of the geometrical overlap
concentration. All simulation data can be fit using a single geometric
parameter for cyclization. The simulation data reveal that within the range of
parameters of the present study correlations among multiply connected molecules
can be neglected. Thus, mean-field treatments of homopolymerizations are
reasonable approximations, if short cycles are properly addressed.
Co-polymerization is considered in the case of strict A-B reactions, where all
reactive groups of individual molecules are either of type A or B. For these
systems we find a clear influence of the local intermixing of A and B groups
for all concentrations investigated. In consequence, mean-field models are less
appropriate to describe the simulation data. The lack of ring structures
containing an odd number of molecules as compared to homopolymerizations at the
same extent of reaction allows for the formation of stable AB networks at
concentrations one order of magnitude below the geometrical overlap
concentration.

conventional paradigm of linear precoding does not, to enhance symbol-level
performance such as symbol error probability (SEP). It also allows the precoder
to take a more general form than linear precoding. This paper aims to better
understand the relationships between SLP and linear precoding, subsequent
design implications, and further connections beyond the existing SLP scope.
Focused on the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations, our study
is built on a basic signal observation, namely, that SLP can be equivalently
represented by a zero-forcing (ZF) linear precoding scheme augmented with some
appropriately chosen symbol-dependent perturbation terms, and that some
extended form of SLP is equivalent to a vector perturbation (VP) nonlinear
precoding scheme augmented with the above-noted perturbation terms. We examine
how insights arising from this perturbed ZF and VP interpretations can be
leveraged to i) substantially simplify the optimization of certain SLP design
criteria, namely, total or peak power minimization subject to SEP quality
guarantees; and ii) draw connections with some existing SLP designs. We also
touch on the analysis side by showing that, under the total power minimization
criterion, the basic ZF scheme is a near-optimal SLP scheme when the QAM order
is very high -- which gives a vital implication that SLP is more useful for
lower-order QAM cases. Numerical results further indicate the merits and
limitations of the different SLP designs derived from the perturbed ZF and VP

by decoupling it into a ""Locate-Then-Segment"" (LTS) scheme. Given a language

position prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a

duration over which FTCS and LCS computations are made in practice is crucial
to their success. If this time is longer than the lifetime of coherence of
individual objects then existing methods will fail to detect the shorter-lived

dialogue systems is an important research challenge. Knowledge Graphs (KG) can
be viewed as an abstraction of the real world, which can potentially facilitate
a dialogue system to produce knowledge grounded responses. However, integrating
KGs into the dialogue generation process in an end-to-end manner is a
non-trivial task. This paper proposes a novel architecture for integrating KGs
into the response generation process by training a BERT model that learns to
answer using the elements of the KG (entities and relations) in a multi-task,
end-to-end setting. The k-hop subgraph of the KG is incorporated into the model
during training and inference using Graph Laplacian. Empirical evaluation
suggests that the model achieves better knowledge groundedness (measured via
Entity F1 score) compared to other state-of-the-art models for both goal and
non-goal oriented dialogues.

networks to estimate crowd density. While effective, these data-driven
approaches rely on large amount of data annotation to achieve good performance,
which stops these models from being deployed in emergencies during which data
annotation is either too costly or cannot be obtained fast enough.
  One popular solution is to use synthetic data for training. Unfortunately,
due to domain shift, the resulting models generalize poorly on real imagery. We
remedy this shortcoming by training with both synthetic images, along with
their associated labels, and unlabeled real images. To this end, we force our
network to learn perspective-aware features by training it to recognize
upside-down real images from regular ones and incorporate into it the ability
to predict its own uncertainty so that it can generate useful pseudo labels for
fine-tuning purposes. This yields an algorithm that consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art cross-domain crowd counting ones without any extra computation

while combining PV with batteries already results in better net present values

between 2020 and 2035 due to the mixed effects of policy changes, costs and
electricity price developments. The optimal PV and battery sizes increase over
time and in 2050 the PV investment is mostly limited by the rooftop size. The
economic viability of PV-battery system investments varies between different
customer groups and the most attractive investment (i.e., that has the shortest

uncertainty. There are two types of temporal aggregation: non-overlapping and
overlapping. Most of the supply chain forecasting literature has focused so far
on the former and there is no research that analyses the latter for
auto-correlated demands. In addition, most of the analytical research to-date
assumes infinite demand series' lengths whereas, in practice, forecasting is
based on finite demand histories. The length of the demand history is an
important determinant of the comparative performance of the two approaches but
has not been given sufficient attention in the literature. In this paper we
examine the effectiveness of temporal aggregation for forecasting finite
auto-correlated demand. We do so by means of an analytical study of the
forecast accuracy of aggregation and non-aggregation approaches based on mean
squared error. We complement this with a numerical analysis to explore the
impact of demand parameters and the length of the series on (comparative)
performance. We also conduct an empirical evaluation to validate the analytical
results using monthly time series of the M4-competition dataset. We find the
degree of auto-correlation, the forecast horizon and the length of the series
to be important determinants of forecast accuracy. We discuss the merits of
each approach and highlight their implications for real world practices.

to use a weighton field to account for charged fermion mass hierarchies rather
than a Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. Such an approach can be applied to flavoured
Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) which can be greatly simplified using modular
forms. As an example, we consider a modular version of a previously proposed
$S_4\times SU(5)$ GUT, with Gatto-Sartori-Tonin and Georgi-Jarlskog relations,
in which all flavons and driving fields are removed, with their effect replaced
by modular forms with moduli assumed to be at various fixed points, rendering
the theory much simpler. In the neutrino sector there are two right-handed
neutrinos constituting a Littlest Seesaw model satisfying Constrained
Sequential Dominance (CSD) where the two columns of the Dirac neutrino mass
matrix are proportional to $(0,1, -1)$ and $(1, n, 2-n)$ respectively, and
$n=1+\sqrt{6}\approx 3.45$ is prescribed by the modular symmetry, with
predictions subject to charged lepton mixing corrections. We perform a
numerical analysis, showing quark and lepton mass and mixing correlations
around the best fit points.

to to construct Pad\'e approximants of the system's transfer functions, which
greatly simplifies the inversion of the solution from the complex domain to the

liquid water can be stable on a planetary surface. Its width is often assumed
to be dictated by the efficiency of the carbonate-silicate cycle, which has
maintained habitable surface conditions on our planet for billions of years.
This cycle may be inhibited by surface condensation of significant amounts of
$CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice, which is likely to occur on distant planets containing
high enough levels of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$. Such a process could
permanently trap $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice within the planet, threatening its
long-term habitability. Recent work has modeled this scenario for initially
cold and icy planetary bodies orbiting the Sun. Here, we use an advanced energy
balance model to consider both initially warm and cold rapidly-rotating planets
orbiting F - K stars. We show that the range of orbital distances where
significant surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation occurs is significantly
reduced for warm start planets. Star type does not affect this conclusion,
although surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condenses over a larger fraction of the
habitable zone around hotter stars. The warm start simulations are thus
consistent with 1-D model predictions, suggesting that the classical habitable
zone limits in those earlier models are still valid. We also find that the cold
start simulations exhibit trends that are consistent with those of previous
work for the Sun although we now extend the analysis to other star types.

mass-loss rates of $27$ and $590~\dot{M}_{\odot}$ for AU Mic. We use our
stellar wind models to assess the generation of electron cyclotron maser
instability emission in both systems, through a mechanism analogous to the
sub-Alfv\'enic Jupiter-Io interaction. For Prox Cen we do not find any feasible
scenario where the planet can induce radio emission in the star's corona, as
the planet orbits too far from the star in the super-Alfv\'enic regime.

induce radio emission from $\sim10$ MHz to 3 GHz in the corona of the host star

available for linear feedback laws, only few results exist for the evaluation
of more general control laws. Recently, an approach to encrypted polynomial
control was presented, relying on two-party secret sharing and an inter-server
communication protocol using homomorphic encryption. As homomorphic encryptions
are much more computationally demanding than secret sharing, they make up for a
tremendous amount of the overall computational demand of this scheme. For this
reason, in this paper, we demonstrate that multi-party computation enables
secure polynomial control based solely on secret sharing. We introduce a novel
secure three-party control scheme based on three-party computation. Further, we
propose a novel $n$-party control scheme to securely evaluate polynomial
feedback laws of arbitrary degree without inter-server communication. The
latter property makes it easier to realize the necessary requirement regarding
non-collusion of the servers, with which perfect security can be guaranteed.
Simulations suggest that the presented control schemes are many times less
computationally demanding than the two-party scheme mentioned above.

to one of m parallel and identical machines such that the expected time it
takes to process them all, the makespan, is minimized. We give two
deterministic algorithms. First, a straightforward adaptation of the
semi-online strategy LightLoad provides a very simple algorithm retaining its
competitive ratio of 1.75. A new and sophisticated algorithm is
1.535-competitive. These competitive ratios are not only obtained in
expectation but, in fact, for all but a very tiny fraction of job orders.
Classically, online makespan minimization only considers the worst-case order.
Here, no competitive ratio below 1.885 for deterministic algorithms and 1.581
using randomization is possible. The best randomized algorithm so far is
1.916-competitive. Our results show that classical worst-case orders are quite
rare and pessimistic for many applications. They also demonstrate the power of
randomization when compared to much stronger deterministic reordering models.
We complement our results by providing first lower bounds. A competitive ratio
obtained on nearly all possible job orders must be at least 1.257. This implies
a lower bound of 1.043 for both deterministic and randomized algorithms in the

learn a temporal evolution of the 3D human shape through spatially continuous

parallelly establish the dense correspondence between predicted occupancy
fields at different time steps via explicitly learning continuous displacement
vector fields from robust spatio-temporal shape representations. Extensive
comparisons against previous state-of-the-arts show the superior accuracy of
our approach for 4D human reconstruction in the problems of 4D shape

elastic collisions of the particles mediated by the boundary, conserving energy
and momenta. A multiple-time-step propagation algorithm is introduced where the
time step is scaled automatically to identify the moment a collision occurs. If
the length of the time step is kept constant, the new propagator reduces to a
regular algorithm for Langevin dynamics, and to the velocity Verlet algorithm
for classical dynamics if the friction coefficient is set to zero. SAFIRES
constitutes the exact limit of the premise behind boundary-based methods such
as FIRES, BEST, and BCC which take advantage of the indistinguishability of
molecules on opposite sides of the separator. It gives correct average ensemble
statistics despite the introduction of an ensemble separator. SAFIRES is tested
in simulations where the molecules on the two sides are treated in the same

samples including 88 and 118 long bursts with known redshift and peak flux over
2.6 ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, from which 79 bursts are picked out to constitute
our complete sample. It is found that the evolution of luminosity with redshift
can be expressed by $L\propto(1+z)^k$ with a diverse $k$ relied more on the
sample selection. Interestingly, the cumulative distributions of either
non-evolving luminosities or redshifts are found to be also determined by the
sample selection rather than the instrumental sensitivity. Nevertheless, the
non-evolving luminosities of our samples are similarly distributed with a
comparable break luminosity of $L_0\sim10^{51}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Importantly, we
verify with a K-S test that three cases of event rates for the two burst
samples evolve with redshift similarly except a small discrepancy due to
sampling differences at low-redshift of $z<1$, in which all event rates show an
excess of Gaussian profile instead of monotonous decline no matter whether the
sample is complete. Most importantly, it is found that the burst rates violate
the star formation rate at low redshift, while both of them are good in
agreement with each other in the higher-redshift regions as many authors
discovered previously. Therefore, we predict that two types of long bursts are
favored in terms of their associations with both the star formation and the

condensing and expanding in both width and depth dimensions. Extensive

meet different targeted computation requirements with better performance than

further introduce an interpretable model of 3D template deformations that

(PBQC) from the perspective of geometric functional analysis and its
connections with quantum games. The main question we are interested in asks for
the optimal amount of entanglement that a coalition of attackers have to share
in order to compromise the security of any PBQC protocol. Known upper bounds
for that quantity are exponential in the size of the quantum systems
manipulated in the honest implementation of the protocol. However, known lower
bounds are only linear.
  In order to deepen the understanding of this question, here we propose a
Position Verification (PV) protocol and find lower bounds on the resources
needed to break it. The main idea behind the proof of these bounds is the
understanding of cheating strategies as vector valued assignments on the
Boolean hypercube. Then, the bounds follow from the understanding of some
geometric properties of particular Banach spaces, their type constants. Under
some regularity assumptions on the former assignment, these bounds lead to
exponential lower bounds on the quantum resources employed, clarifying the
question in this restricted case. Known attacks indeed satisfy the assumption
we make, although we do not know how universal this feature is. Furthermore, we
show that the understanding of the type properties of some more involved Banach
spaces would allow to drop out the assumptions and lead to unconditional lower
bounds on the resources used to attack our protocol. Unfortunately, we were not
able to estimate the relevant type constant. Despite that, we conjecture an
upper bound for this quantity and show some evidence supporting it. A positive
solution of the conjecture would lead to stronger security guarantees for the
proposed PV protocol providing a better understanding of the question asked
above.

hard pseudo labels for hard instance contrast, which aims at reducing
intra-class variance. Then, we use similarity scores as soft pseudo labels to
enhance the consistency between augmented and original views, which makes our
model more robust to augmentation perturbations. Experiments on several
large-scale person ReID datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed

Recent advances in neural rendering showed promise of unlocking new
possibilities in 3D computer graphics via image-based representations of
virtual or physical environments. Specifically, the neural radiance fields
(NeRF) demonstrated that photo-realistic quality and continuous view changes of
3D scenes can be achieved without loss of view-dependent effects. While NeRF
can significantly benefit rendering for VR applications, it faces unique
challenges posed by high field-of-view, high resolution, and
stereoscopic/egocentric viewing, typically causing low quality and high latency
of the rendered images. In VR, this not only harms the interaction experience
but may also cause sickness. To tackle these problems toward
six-degrees-of-freedom, egocentric, and stereo NeRF in VR, we present the first

incorporate the human psychophysics of visual- and stereo-acuity into an
egocentric neural representation of 3D scenery. We then jointly optimize the
latency/performance and visual quality while mutually bridging human perception
and neural scene synthesis to achieve perceptually high-quality immersive

evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. We find that our method
significantly reduces latency (up to 99% time reduction compared with NeRF)

full-resolution ground truth). The presented approach may serve as the first
step toward future VR/AR systems that capture, teleport, and visualize remote

mass measurement through gravitational waves leads to a lower limit on neutron

set of assumptions, the radii of neutron stars with typical masses should be
larger than about 10.7~km. This implies a lower limit on the tidal
deformability of about 210, while much stronger lower bounds are not supported
by the data of GW170817. The multi-messenger interpretation of GW170817 rules
out very soft nuclear matter and complements the upper bounds on NS radii which
are derived from the measurement of finite-size effects during the pre-merger

convolutional neural network(CNN)-based approaches for semantic segmentation

However, existing UDA approaches in this regard inevitably require the full
access to source datasets to reduce the gap between the source and target
domains during model adaptation, which are impractical in the real scenarios
where the source datasets are private, and thus cannot be released along with
the well-trained source models. To cope with this issue, we propose a
source-free domain adaptation framework for semantic segmentation, namely SFDA,
in which only a well-trained source model and an unlabeled target domain
dataset are available for adaptation. SFDA not only enables to recover and
preserve the source domain knowledge from the source model via knowledge
transfer during model adaptation, but also distills valuable information from
the target domain for self-supervised learning. The pixel- and patch-level
optimization objectives tailored for semantic segmentation are seamlessly
integrated in the framework. The extensive experimental results on numerous

control. Recently, the finite-time analysis of Greedy-GQ has been developed
under linear function approximation and Markovian sampling, and the algorithm
is shown to achieve an $\epsilon$-stationary point with a sample complexity in
the order of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. Such a high sample complexity is due
to the large variance induced by the Markovian samples. In this paper, we
propose a variance-reduced Greedy-GQ (VR-Greedy-GQ) algorithm for off-policy
optimal control. In particular, the algorithm applies the SVRG-based variance
reduction scheme to reduce the stochastic variance of the two time-scale
updates. We study the finite-time convergence of VR-Greedy-GQ under linear
function approximation and Markovian sampling and show that the algorithm
achieves a much smaller bias and variance error than the original Greedy-GQ. In
particular, we prove that VR-Greedy-GQ achieves an improved sample complexity
that is in the order of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$. We further compare the
performance of VR-Greedy-GQ with that of Greedy-GQ in various RL experiments to
corroborate our theoretical findings.

magnetic interaction between the star and the inner accretion disk in young
stellar objects. We present the case of the young stellar system V2129 Oph,
which is a well-known T Tauri star. We performed a time series analysis of this
star using high-resolution spectroscopic data at optical and infrared
wavelengths from CFHT/ESPaDOnS, ESO/HARPS and CFHT/SPIRou. The new data sets
allowed us to characterize the accretion-ejection structure in this system and
to investigate its evolution over a timescale of a decade via comparisons to
previous observational data. We measure radial velocity variations and recover
a stellar rotation period of 6.53d. However, we do not recover the stellar
rotation period in the variability of various circumstellar lines, such as
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ in the optical or HeI 1083nm and Pa$\beta$ in the
infrared. Instead, we show that the optical and infrared line profile
variations are consistent with a magnetospheric accretion scenario that shows
variability with a period of about 6.0d, shorter than the stellar rotation
period. Additionally, we find a period of 8.5d in H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines,
probably due to a structure located beyond the corotation radius, at a distance
of 0.09au. We investigate whether this could be accounted for by a wind
component, twisted or multiple accretion funnel flows, or an external
disturbance in the inner disk. We conclude that the dynamics of the
accretion-ejection process can vary significantly on a timescale of just a few
years, presumably reflecting the evolving magnetic field topology at the
stellar surface.

contextuality and entanglement. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a
fundamental limitation on the measurement of the product of incompatible
observables, a `joint' measurement. However, recently a method using weak
measurement has experimentally demonstrated joint measurement. This method
[Lundeen, J. S., and Bamber, C. Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 070402, 2012] delivers
the standard expectation value of the product of observables, even if they are
incompatible. A drawback of this method is that it requires coupling each
observable to a distinct degree of freedom (DOF), i.e., a disjoint Hilbert
space. Typically, this `read-out' system is an unused internal DOF of the
measured particle. Unfortunately, one quickly runs out of internal DOFs, which
limits the number of observables and types of measurements one can make. To
address this limitation, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a technique
to perform a joint weak-measurement of two incompatible observables using only
one DOF as a read-out system. We apply our scheme to directly measure the
density matrix of photon polarization states.

we propose a Snippet Contrast (SniCo) Loss to refine the hard snippet
representation in feature space, which guides the network to perceive precise
temporal boundaries and avoid the temporal interval interruption. Besides,
since it is infeasible to access frame-level annotations, we introduce a Hard

approximation of the biharmonic problem. The methods support polyhedral meshes,
rely on the primal formulation of the problem, and deliver $O(h^{k+1})$
$H^2$-error estimates when using polynomials of order $k\ge0$ to approximate
the normal derivative on the mesh (inter)faces. Both HHO methods hinge on a
stabilization in the spirit of Lehrenfeld--Sch\""oberl for second-order PDEs.
The cell unknowns are polynomials of order $(k+2)$ that can be eliminated
locally by means of static condensation. The face unknowns approximating the
trace of the solution on the mesh (inter)faces are polynomials of order $(k+1)$
in the first HHO method which is valid in dimension two and uses an original
stabilization involving the canonical hybrid finite element, and they are of
order $(k+2)$ for the second HHO method which is valid in arbitrary dimension
and uses only $L^2$-orthogonal projections in the stabilization. A comparative
discussion with the weak Galerkin methods from the literature is provided,
highlighting the close connections and the improvements proposed herein.
Additionally, we show how the two HHO methods can be combined with a
Nitsche-like boundary-penalty technique to weakly enforce the boundary
conditions. An originality in the devised Nitsche's technique is to avoid any
penalty parameter that must be large enough. Finally, numerical results
showcase the efficiency of the proposed methods and indicate that the HHO
methods can generally outperform discontinuous Galerkin methods and even be
competitive with $C^0$-interior penalty methods on triangular meshes.

with identifying the highest-value subset of resources; in this context,
game-theoretic approaches are known to yield Nash equilibria within a factor of

communication failure and cannot observe the actions of other agents; in this
case, recent work has shown that if there are k>0 compromised agents, Nash
equilibria are only guaranteed to be within a factor of k+1 of optimal.
However, the present paper shows that this worst-case guarantee is fragile; in
a sense which we make precise, we show that if a problem instance has a very
poor worst-case guarantee, then it is necessarily very ""close"" to a problem
instance with an optimal Nash equilibrium. Conversely, an instance that is far
from one with an optimal Nash equilibrium necessarily has relatively good
worst-case performance guarantees. To contextualize this fragility, we perform
simulations using the log-linear learning algorithm and show that average
performance on worst-case instances is considerably better even than our
improved analytical guarantees. This suggests that the fragility of the price

novel shape signature for 2D bounded simply-connected domains, named the
Harmonic Beltrami signature (HBS). The proposed signature is based on the
harmonic extension of the conformal welding map of a unit circle and its
Beltrami coefficient. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
the quotient space of HBS and the space of 2D simply-connected shapes up to a
translation, rotation and scaling. With a suitable normalization, each
equivalence class in the quotient space of HBS is associated to a unique
representative. It gets rid of the conformal ambiguity. As such, each shape is
associated to a unique HBS. Conversely, the associated shape of a HBS can be
reconstructed based on quasiconformal Teichmuller theories, which is uniquely
determined up to a translation, rotation and scaling. The HBS is thus an
effective fingerprint to represent a 2D shape. The robustness of HBS is studied
both theoretically and experimentally. With the HBS, simple metric, such as L2,
can be used to measure geometric dissimilarity between shapes. Experiments have
been carried out to classify shapes in different classes using HBS. Results
show good classification performance, which demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed shape signature.

Voronov in \texttt{arXiv:1808.10049}. (This operator is an analogue of the
Koszul--Brylinski boundary operator $\partial_P$ which defines Poisson homology
for an ordinary Poisson structure.)
  Here we introduce $\Delta=\Delta_P$ by a different method and establish its
properties. We show that this BV type operator generating higher Koszul
brackets can be included in a one-parameter family of BV type formal
$\hbar$-differential operators, which can be understood as a quantization of
the cotangent $L_{\infty}$-bialgebroid. We obtain symmetric description on both
$\Pi TM$ and $\Pi T^*M$.
  For the purpose of the above, we develop in detail a theory of formal
$\hbar$-differential operators and also of operators acting on densities on
dual vector bundles. In particular, we have a statement about operators that
can be seen as a quantization of the Mackenzie--Xu canonical diffeomorphism.
Another interesting feature is that we are able to introduce a grading, not a
filtration, on our algebras of operators. When operators act on objects on
vector bundles, we obtain a bi-grading.

expiratory events like coughing, but also through routine activities like
breathing/speaking/singing. We perform direct numerical simulations of the

It is shown that a two-way conversation significantly reduces the aerosol
exposure compared to a relative monologue by one person and relative silence of
the other. This is because the interaction of the jets ejected from the mouth
of each speaker produce a ""canceling"" effect. Unequal conversation is shown to
significantly increase the risk of infection to the person who talks less.
Interestingly, a small height difference is worse for infection spread, due to
reduced interference between the two speech jets, than two faces at the same
level! For small axial separation, speech jets show large oscillations and
reach the other person intermittently. We suggest a range of lateral
separations between two people to minimize transmission risk. A realistic
estimate of the infection probability is provided by including exposure through
eyes and mouth, in addition to the more common method of using inhaled virions
alone. We expect that our results will provide useful inputs to epidemiological

(e.g. hourly) and longer-term (e.g. yearly) uncertainties in power system
planning with increasing penetration of renewable and storage resources. In
conventional planning decision making, shorter-term (e.g., hourly) variations
are not explicitly accounted for. However, given the deepening penetration of
variable resources, it is becoming imperative to consider such shorter-term
variation in the longer-term planning exercise. By leveraging the abundant
amount of operational observation data, we propose a scenario-based robust
planning framework that provides rigorous guarantees on the future operation
risk of planning decisions considering a broad range of operational conditions,
such as renewable generation fluctuations and load variations. By connecting
two-stage robust optimization with the scenario approach theory, we show that
with a carefully chosen number of scenarios, the operational risk level of the
robust solution can be adaptive to the risk preference set by planners. The
theoretical guarantees hold true for any distributions, and the proposed
approach is scalable towards real-world power grids. Furthermore, the
column-and-constraint generation algorithm is used to solve the two-stage
robust planning problem and tighten theoretical guarantees. We substantiate
this framework through a planning problem of energy storage in a power grid
with deep renewable penetration. Case studies are performed on large-scale test
systems (modified IEEE 118-bus system) to illustrate the theoretical bounds as
well as the scalability of proposed algorithm.

growing interest in the last decades. A major challenge in performing
high-fidelity simulations of such flows resides in the stringent requirements
for the numerical schemes to be used. These must be robust enough to handle
strong, unsteady discontinuities, while ensuring low amounts of intrinsic
dissipation in smooth flow regions. Furthermore, the wide range of temporal and
spatial active scales leads to concurrent needs for numerical stabilization and
accurate representation of the smallest resolved flow scales in cases of
under-resolved configurations. In this paper, we present a finite-difference
high-order shock-capturing technique based on Jameson's artificial diffusivity
methodology. The resulting scheme is ninth-order-accurate far from
discontinuities and relies on the addition of artificial dissipation close to
large gradients. The shock detector is slightly revised to enhance its
selectivity and avoid spurious activations of the shock-capturing term. A suite

strategy to handle a large variety of problems, ranging from

joyful responses, responses with specific words, etc. We examined our framework
using three experimental setups and evaluated the guiding chatbot with four
different metrics to demonstrate flexibility and performance advantages.
Additionally, we performed trials with human interlocutors to substantiate the

quasi-adiabatic flat-plate air flow at free-stream Mach number equal to 10 is
simulated up to fully-developed turbulent conditions using a five-species,
chemically-reacting model. A companion DNS based on a frozen-chemistry
assumption is also carried out, in order to isolate the effect of finite-rate
chemical reactions and assess their influence on turbulent quantities. In order
to reduce uncertainties associated with turbulence generation at the inlet of
the computational domain, both simulations are initiated in the laminar flow
region and the flow is let to evolve up to the fully turbulent regime. Modal
forcing by means of localized suction and blowing is used to trigger
laminar-to-turbulent transition. The high temperatures reached in the near wall
region including the viscous and buffer sublayers activate significant
dissociation of both oxygen and nitrogen. This modifies in turn the
thermodynamic and transport properties of the reacting mixture, affecting the
first-order statistics of thermodynamic quantities. Due to the endothermic
nature of the chemical reactions in the forward direction, temperature and
density fluctuations in the reacting layer are smaller than in the
frozen-chemistry flow. However, the first- and second-order statistics of the
velocity field are found to be little affected by the chemical reactions under
a scaling that accounts for the modified fluid properties. We also observed
that the Strong Reynolds Analogy (SRA) remains well respected despite the

Nucleation experiments were therefore made in a microgravity environment using
the Electromagnetic Levitation facility on the International Space Station on a
bulk glass-forming Zr57Cu15.4Ni12.6Al10Nb5 (Vit106), as well as Cu50Zr50 and
the quasicrystal-forming Ti39.5Zr39.5Ni21 liquids. The maximum supercooling
temperatures for each alloy were measured as a function of controlled stirring
by applying various combinations of radio frequency positioner and heater

from the known parameters for the coil and the levitated samples. The maximum
nucleation temperatures increased systematically with increased fluid flow in
the liquids for Vit106, but stayed nearly unchanged for the other two. These

A topological phase transition occurs at a critical photon-emitter coupling

yielding a dissipative topological phase transition. In the protected

(BBHs) in their centers, and their optical/UV periodicities are interpreted as
caused by either the Doppler-boosting (DB) effect of continuum emission from
the disk around the secondary black hole (BH) or intrinsic accretion rate
variation. However, no other definitive evidence has been found to confirm such
a BBH interpretation(s). In this paper, we investigate the responses of broad
emission lines (BELs) to the continuum variations for these quasars under two
BBH scenarios, and check whether they can be distinguished from each other and
from that of a single BH system. We assume a simple circumbinary broad-line
region (BLR) model, compatible with BLR size estimates, with a standard
$\Gamma$ distribution of BLR clouds. We find that BELs may change significantly
and periodically under the BBH scenarios due to (1) the position variation of
the secondary BH and (2) the DB effect, if significant, and/or intrinsic
variation, which is significantly different from the case of a single BH
system. For the two BBH scenarios, the responses of BELs to (apparent)
continuum variations, caused by the DB effect or intrinsic rate variation, are
also significantly different from each other, mainly because the DB effect has
a preferred direction along the direction of motion of the secondary BH, while
that due to intrinsic variation does not. Such differences in the responses of
BELs from different scenarios may offer a robust way to distinguish different
interpretations of periodic quasars and to identify BBHs, if any, in these
systems.

to dynamically fine-tune the source model on test video streams with additional

over-fitting the 2D information of individual test frames. A subsequent
challenge is how to avoid conflicts between the 2D and temporal constraints. We

Centre de Physique Th\'eorique, under the supervision of Serge Lazzarini. Two
subjects are presented in the manuscript, both aiming at studying the effect of
the spin of elementary particles on otherwise known theories.
  First is a study of the L\'evy-Leblond-Newton (LLN) equation, which is used
to describe the evolution of a quantum system with spin 1/2 that is coupled to
its own gravitational potential. After reviewing some symmetries of non
relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and how to geometrize them with the help of
Bargmann structures, we recall what is the L\'evy-Leblond equation. In this
chapter, the LLN equation is described in a fully covariant way on Bargmann
structures. This covariant formulation then helps to derive the dynamical
symmetries of the equation, and conserved quantities. The symmetry group of
this equation turns out to be the already known Schr\""odinger-Newton group.
  The second part deals with the trajectory of particles with spin in General
Relativity. We first highlight Souriau's geometric method to derive the
Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, and then discuss the different
possible Spin Supplementary Conditions (SSC) that exist to close the system of
MPD equations. In this chapter, we assume the Tulczyjew SSC to describe the
trajectory of photons, leading to the Souriau-Saturnini equations. We then
present some works where we have applied these equations, in a Schwarzschild
spacetime, and in a spacetime deformed by a gravitational wave. In the first
work, we found gravitational birefringence: the trajectory deviates from the
geodesic plane, depending on the helicity of the photon and its wavelength. The
second work presented also found birefringence in gravitational interferometry
experiments, however the effect is many orders of magnitude lower than what we
can detect.

since the fine-grained feature of novel object can be easily overlooked with

propose Dense Relation Distillation with Context-aware Aggregation (DCNet) to

covering all spatial locations in a feed-forward fashion. The abundant usage of
the guidance information endows model the capability to handle common
challenges such as appearance changes and occlusions. Moreover, to better
capture scale-aware features, Context-aware Aggregation module adaptively
harnesses features from different scales for a more comprehensive feature
representation. Extensive experiments illustrate that our proposed approach

points of these internal nodes through the corresponding boundary conditions.
Using an analytical model as a reference, the ECMLS algorithm is compared to
the constrained moving least-squares (CMLS) algorithm and the staircase model
using various grid sizes, interpolation basis functions, weight functions, and
the penalty parameter of the constraint. It is found that using ECMLS algorithm
in the investigated diffusion application, the incomplete quartic basis
function yields the best performance while the quadratic, cubic, and bicubic
basis functions also produce results better than the staircase model. It is
also found that the linear and bilinear basis functions cannot produce results
better than the staircase model in diffusion applications. It is shown that the
optimal radius of the region of internal nodes used for interpolation scales

a unique tool to analyse debris flows. In addition, the recent coupling with
other solvers like Project Chrono or MoorDyn has been a milestone in the

situations where these users interact with autonomous cyber or cyber-physical

theory (CPT) is a paradigm that has been empirically shown to model a tendency
of humans to view gains and losses differently. In this paper, we consider a
setting where an autonomous agent has to learn behaviors in an unknown
environment. In traditional reinforcement learning, these behaviors are learned
through repeated interactions with the environment by optimizing an expected
utility. In order to endow the agent with the ability to closely mimic the
behavior of human users, we optimize a CPT-based cost. We introduce the notion
of the CPT-value of an action taken in a state, and establish the convergence
of an iterative dynamic programming-based approach to estimate this quantity.
We develop two algorithms to enable agents to learn policies to optimize the
CPT-vale, and evaluate these algorithms in environments where a target state
has to be reached while avoiding obstacles. We demonstrate that behaviors of
the agent learned using these algorithms are better aligned with that of a
human user who might be placed in the same environment, and is significantly

modeling steps used to create 3D shapes is a long-sought-after goal. This
process can be decomposed into two sub-problems: converting an input mesh or
point cloud into a boundary representation (or B-rep), and then inferring
modeling operations which construct this B-rep. In this paper, we present a new
system for solving the second sub-problem. Central to our approach is a new
geometric representation: the zone graph. Zones are the set of solid regions
formed by extending all B-Rep faces and partitioning space with them; a zone
graph has these zones as its nodes, with edges denoting geometric adjacencies
between them. Zone graphs allow us to tractably work with industry-standard CAD
operations, unlike prior work using CSG with parametric primitives. We focus on
CAD programs consisting of sketch + extrude + Boolean operations, which are
common in CAD practice. We phrase our problem as search in the space of such
extrusions permitted by the zone graph, and we train a graph neural network to
score potential extrusions in order to accelerate the search. We show that our
approach outperforms an existing CSG inference baseline in terms of geometric
reconstruction accuracy and reconstruction time, while also creating more
plausible modeling sequences.

the value of the unit of temperature can be the classical thermal energy

classical model hydrogen atom, of the radius of its Rydberg wavelength, is in

Boltzmann's constant that serves as the measure of the absolute temperature in
kelvins.

closures on the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. The mathematical analysis of
compartmental models with subpopulations shows that the in-school contact rates
affects the overall course of the pandemic only above a certain threshold that
separates an influence phase from a non-influence one. The threshold, that we
calculate via linear approximation in several cases, seems to appear in all
contexts, including outbreaks or new strains upsurge, lockdowns, and
vaccination campaigns excluding children, albeit with different values. Our
theoretical findings are then confirmed by several data-driven studies that
have previously identified the phase transition in specific cases. Specific
outcomes of this study are: opposite conclusions reached by studies of the same
or similar situations might depend on, possibly small, differences in modeling
or in parameter estimation from the very noisy Covid-19 data, that result in
identifying different phases; it is possible to keep schools open at any stage
of the Covid-19 pandemic, but suitably strict rules must be applied at all
times or else this becomes highly detrimental to virus containment efforts; as
the threshold during vaccination turns out to correspond to the internal
transmission rate that would lead to virus extinction if the school population
was isolated, the needed strict control can be sustained only for very brief
periods; as a result, either schools will have to face a prolonged closure or
children need to be vaccinated as well.

identify urban space attractiveness. We exploit their unique feature -
stopovers: short, non traffic-related stops made by cyclists during their
trips. As we demonstrate on the case-study of Krakow (Poland), when applied to
a big dataset, meaningful patterns appear, with hotspots (places with long and
frequent stopovers) identified at both the top tourist and leisure attractions
as well as emerging new places.
  We propose a generic method, applicable to any spatiotemporal city-bike
traces, providing results meaningful to understand both the general urban space
attractiveness and its dynamics. With the proposed filtering (to mitigate a
selection bias) and empirical cross-validation (to rule-out false-positive
classifications) results effectively reveal spatial patterns of urban
attractiveness. Valuable for decision-makers and analysts to enhance
understanding of urban space consumption patterns by tourists and residents.

  Edge Learning","accepted to IEEE ICC 2021 WS",,,,"cs.LG cs.DC cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated edge learning (FEEL) is a promising distributed learning technique
for next-generation wireless networks. FEEL preserves the user's privacy,
reduces the communication costs, and exploits the unprecedented capabilities of
edge devices to train a shared global model by leveraging a massive amount of
data generated at the network edge. However, FEEL might significantly shorten
energy-constrained participating devices' lifetime due to the power consumed
during the model training round. This paper proposes a novel approach that
endeavors to minimize computation and communication energy consumption during
FEEL rounds to address this issue. First, we introduce a modified local
training algorithm that intelligently selects only the samples that enhance the
model's quality based on a predetermined threshold probability. Then, the
problem is formulated as joint energy minimization and resource allocation
optimization problem to obtain the optimal local computation time and the
optimal transmission time that minimize the total energy consumption
considering the worker's energy budget, available bandwidth, channel states,
beamforming, and local CPU speed. After that, we introduce a tractable solution
to the formulated problem that ensures the robustness of FEEL. Our simulation
results show that our solution substantially outperforms the baseline FEEL
algorithm as it reduces the local consumed energy by up to 79%.

introduce inhomogeneous versions of the Cox process models which are able to
quantify the effect of geological factors such as subduction zone, fault, and
volcano on the major earthquake distribution in Sulawesi and Maluku, Indonesia.
In particular, we compare Thomas, Cauchy, variance-Gamma, and log-Gaussian Cox
models and consider parametric intensity and pair correlation functions to
enhance model interpretability. We perform model selection using the Akaike
information criterion (AIC) and envelopes test. We conclude that the nearest
distances to the subduction zone and volcano give a significant impact on the
risk of earthquake occurrence in Sulawesi and Maluku. Furthermore, the Cauchy
and variance-Gamma cluster models fit well the major earthquake distribution in
Sulawesi and Maluku.

provides a convenient framework for analysis of ultra violet divergences, but
the computations in a realistic model become complicated. In this paper a new

principle for damage identification. As part of SHM, the propagation of
ultrasonic guided waves (UGWs) is tracked and analyzed for the changes in the
associated wave pattern. These changes help identify the location of a
structural damage, if any. We advance existing research by accounting for
uncertainty in the material and geometric properties of a structure. The
physics model used in this study comprises of a monolithically coupled system
of acoustic and elastic wave equations, known as the wave propagation in
fluid-solid and their interface (WpFSI) problem. As the UGWs propagate in the
solid, fluid, and their interface, the wave signal displacement measurements
are contrasted against the benchmark pattern. For the numerical solution, we
develop an efficient algorithm that successfully addresses the inherent
complexity of solving the multiphysics problem under uncertainty. We present a
procedure that uses Gaussian process regression and convolutional neural
network for predicting the UGW propagation in a solid-fluid and their interface
under uncertainty. First, a set of training images for different realizations
of the uncertain parameters of the inclusion inside the structure is generated
using a monolithically-coupled system of acoustic and elastic wave equations.
Next, Gaussian processes trained with these images are used for predicting the
propagated wave with convolutional neural networks for further enhancement to
produce high-quality images of the wave patterns for new realizations of the
uncertainty. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides an
accurate prediction for the WpFSI problem in the presence of uncertainty.
