integrated quantum light source for telecom band polarization entangled Bell
state generation and dynamical manipulation. Biphoton states were firstly
generated in four silicon waveguides by spontaneous four wave mixing. They were
transformed to polarization entangled Bell states through on-chip quantum
interference and quantum superposition, and then coupled to optical fibers. The
property of polarization entanglement in generated photon pairs was
demonstrated by two-photon interferences under two non-orthogonal polarization
bases. The output state could be dynamically switched between two polarization
entangled Bell states, which was demonstrated by the experiment of simplified
Bell state measurement. The experiment results indicate that its manipulation
speed supported a modulation rate of several tens kHz, showing its potential on
applications of quantum communication and quantum information processing
requiring dynamical quantum entangled Bell state control.

numerical strain-controlled bulk and shear deformations. Since the method is
independent of a reference state, it extends also to defected crystals. We
exemplify this by considering an edge and screw dislocation in the simple cubic

$c_{k}(y)$ to recover all parameters of $y$, where $N:=\sum_{j=1}^{M}

that for $\lambda_{j} \not\in \frac{{\mathrm i}}{P} {\mathbb Z}$ the terms of
$y$ possess Fourier coefficients with rational structure. We employ a recently
proposed stable iterative rational approximation algorithm in [12]. If a
sufficiently large set of $L$ Fourier coefficients of $y$ is available (i.e.,
$L > 2N+2$), then our recovery method automatically detects the number $M$ of
terms of $y$, the multiplicities $n_{j}$ for $j=1, \ldots , M$, as well as all

show that the natural basis to discuss the geometrical effects of the boost are
the helicity eigenstates in the rest frame. In the mid-relativistic regime
(where the Wigner rotation angle is limited by $\delta < \frac{\pi}{2}$) we
prove for states with equal helicity that the entanglement with respect to the

ultra-relativistic regime ($\delta > \frac{\pi}{2}$) the entanglement is
increasing. If the states are prepared as a superposition of unequal helicity
eigenstates, the monotonic behaviour is inverted. This implies that in the
ultra-relativistic regime a geometrical setup can be found such that the amount

partial differential equations. Computing a pure hexahedral mesh from an
adaptively refined grid is a prominent approach to automatic hexmeshing, and
requires the ability to restore the all hex property around the hanging nodes
that arise at the interface between cells having different size. The most
advanced tools to accomplish this task are based on mesh dualization. These
approaches use topological schemes to regularize the valence of inner vertices
and edges, such that dualizing the grid yields a pure hexahedral mesh. In this
paper we study in detail the dual approach, and propose four main contributions
to it: (i) we enumerate all the possible transitions that dual methods must be
able to handle, showing that prior schemes do not natively cover all of them;
(ii) we show that schemes are internally asymmetric, therefore not only their
implementation is ambiguous, but different implementation choices lead to
hexahedral meshes with different singular structure; (iii) we explore the
combinatorial space of dual schemes, selecting the minimum set that covers all
the possible configurations and also yields the simplest singular structure in
the output hexmesh; (iv) we enlarge the class of adaptive grids that can be
transformed into pure hexahedral meshes, relaxing one of the tight requirements
imposed by previous approaches, and ultimately permitting to obtain much
coarser meshes for same geometric accuracy. Last but not least, for the first
time we make grid-based hexmeshing truly reproducible, releasing our code and
also revealing a conspicuous amount of technical details that were always
overlooked in previous literature, creating an entry barrier that was hard to
overcome for practitioners in the field.

quickly describe and implement new networking applications. Although a large
variety of applications can be described with the P4 language, current
programmable switch architectures impose significant constraints on P4
programs. To address this shortcoming, FPGAs have been explored as potential
targets for P4 applications. P4 applications are described using three
abstractions: a packet parser, match-action tables, and a packet deparser,
which reassembles the output packet with the result of the match-action tables.
While implementations of packet parsers and match-action tables on FPGAs have
been widely covered in the literature, no general design principles have been
presented for the packet deparser. Indeed, implementing a high-speed and
efficient deparser on FPGAs remains an open issue because it requires a large
amount of interconnections and the architecture must be tailored to a P4
program. As a result, in several works where a P4 application is implemented on
FPGAs, the deparser consumes a significant proportion of chip resources. Hence,
in this paper, we address this issue by presenting design principles for
efficient and high-speed deparsers on FPGAs. As an artifact, we introduce a
tool that generates an efficient vendor-agnostic deparser architecture from a
P4 program. Our design has been validated and simulated with a cocotb-based
framework. The resulting architecture is implemented on Xilinx Ultrascale+
FPGAs and supports a throughput of more than 200 Gbps while reducing resource
usage by almost 10$\times$ compared to other solutions.

learning the underlying transformations (e.g., the transition of seasons) from

especially under the unsupervised setting. To tackle this obstacle, we propose
a novel learning framework built on generative adversarial networks (GANs),
where the discriminator and the generator share a transformation space. After
the model gets fully optimized, any two points within the shared space are
expected to define a valid transformation. In this way, at the inference stage,
we manage to adequately extract the variation factor between a customizable
image pair by projecting both images onto the transformation space. The
resulting transformation vector can further guide the image synthesis,
facilitating image editing with continuous semantic change (e.g., altering
summer to winter with fall as the intermediate step). Noticeably, the learned
transformation space supports not only transferring image styles (e.g.,
changing day to night), but also manipulating image contents (e.g., adding
clouds in the sky). In addition, we make in-depth analysis on the properties of
the transformation space to help understand how various transformations are

separated by the phases $g=+1$ and $g=-1$ of the Landau problem in the
symmetric gauge with opposite orientation of the magnetic field. A hidden
symmetry emerges in the system at rational values of $g$. Its generators,
together with the Hamiltonian and angular momentum produce non-linearly
deformed $\mathfrak{u}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{gl}(2,{\mathbb R})$ algebras in the
cases of $0<|g|<1$ and $\infty>|g|>1$, which transmute one into another under
the inversion $g\rightarrow -1/g$. Similarly, the true, $\mathfrak{u}(2)$, and

long-lived 10-2000 bar atmospheres that are H$_2$O-dominated, with mean
molecular weight $>$10. These atmospheres form during the planets' evolution
from sub-Neptunes into rocky exoplanets. H$_2$O that is made by reduction of
iron oxides in the silicate magma is highly soluble in the magma, forming a
dissolved reservoir that is protected from loss so long as the H$_2$-dominated
atmosphere persists. The large size of the dissolved reservoir buffers the
H$_2$O atmosphere against loss after the H$_2$ has dispersed. Within our model,
a long-lived, water-dominated atmosphere is a common outcome for efficient
interaction between a nebula-derived atmosphere (peak atmosphere mass fraction
0.1-0.6 wt%) and oxidized magma ($>$5 wt% FeO), followed by atmospheric loss.
This idea predicts that most rocky planets that have orbital periods of 10-100

testable with JWST and has implications for the interpretation of data for

processes, in which the reaction terms depend on the discrete state of a
randomly switching environment. We proceed by spatially discretizing a given RD
system and using a spinor representation of the environmental states to derive
a path integral for the lattice model. In the case of large molecular numbers,
the corresponding continuum path integral action is expressed in terms of an
effective Hamiltonian, which involves a concentration field $u(\x,t)$, $\x\in
\R^d$, a conjugate field $v(\x,t)$, and $M$ auxiliary conjugate pairs
$(c_m(t),\phi_m(t))$, where $M$ is the number of discrete environmental states.
The variable $c_m(t)$ determines the effective probability that a sample path
is exposed to the $m$-th environmental state at time $t$, with
$\sum_{m=1}^Mc_m(t)=1$. We then consider the semi-classical (adiabatic) limit
$\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, where $\epsilon^{-1}$ determines the rate of
switching between the environmental states. We show how the auxiliary variables
can be eliminated to yield an action functional for the fields $u$ and $v$
alone. The associated Hamiltonian is the sum of a diffusion term and the Perron
or principal eigenvalue of a functional linear operator involving the reaction
terms and the matrix generator of the switching process. The reduced path
integral is then used to derive a functional Hamilton-Jacobi equation for least
action paths and to obtain a Gaussian noise approximation of the stochastic
hybrid RD system in the adiabatic limit. Finally, the path integral in the case
of low molecular numbers is constructed by considering a corresponding RD
master equation. It is now necessary to take into account two sources of noise,
one due to the switching environment and the other due to fluctuations in
molecular numbers.

where the total height of the interface is conserved. Recently, it was
suggested [F. Caballero et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 020601 (2018)] that the
original continuum model known as `Conserved Kardar-Parisi-Zhang'(CKPZ)
equation is incomplete, as additional non-linearity is not forbidden by any
symmetry in $d > 1$. In this work, we perform detailed field-theoretic
renormalization group (RG) analysis of a general stochastic model describing
conserved surface roughening. Systematic power counting reveals additional
marginal interaction at the upper critical dimension, which appears also in the
context of molecular beam epitaxy. Depending on the origin of the surface
particle's mobility, the resulting model shows two different scaling regimes;
If the particles move mainly due to the gravity, the leading dispersion law is
$\omega \sim k^2$, and the mean-field approximation describing a flat interface
is exact in any spatial dimension. On the other hand, if the particles move
mainly due to the surface curvature, the interface becomes rough with the
mean-field dispersion law $\omega \sim k^4$ , and the corrections to scaling
exponents must be taken into account. We show, that the latter model consist of
two sub-class of models that are decoupled in all orders of perturbation
theory. Moreover, our RG analysis of the general model reveals that the
universal scaling is described by a rougher interface than CKPZ universality
class. The universal exponents are derived within the one-loop approximation in
both fixed $d$ and $\varepsilon$-expansion schemes, and their relation is
discussed. We point out all important details behind these two schemes which
are often overlooked in the literature, and their misinterpretation might lead
to inconsistent results.

neural networks. We extend it to the NR case, using some different features but
similar learning, to develop a partially unified framework for VQA. When fully
trained, FR algorithms such as VMAF perform very well on test datasets,
reaching 90%+ match in PCC and SRCC; but for predicting performance in the
wild, we train/test from scratch for each database. With an 80/20 train/test
split, we still achieve about 90% performance on average in both PCC and SRCC,
with up to 7-9% gains over VMAF, using an improved motion feature and better
regression. Moreover, we even get decent performance (about 75%) if we ignore
the reference, treating FR as NR, partly justifying our attempts at
unification. In the true NR case, we reduce complexity vs. leading recent
algorithms VIDEVAL, RAPIQUE, yet achieve performance within 3-5%. Moreover, we
develop a method to analyze the saliency of features, and conclude that for
both VIDEVAL and RAPIQUE, a small subset of their features are providing the
bulk of the performance. In short, we find encouraging improvements in
trainability in FR, while constraining training complexity against leading
methods in NR, elucidating the saliency of features for feature selection.

of a strong external magnetic field $ x \mapsto \epsilon^{-1} \mathbf{B}_e(x)$,

show a uniform lower bound ($0<T<T_\epsilon$) on the lifetime of solutions and
uniform Sup-Norm estimates. A bootstrap argument allows us to show $f$ remains

aperiodic arrays designed from the statistically isotropic pinwheel tiling. By
studying the scaling of the cumulative integral of its structure factor in
combination with higher-order structural correlation analysis we conclude that
pinwheel arrays belong to the weakly hyperuniformity class. Moreover, by
solving the multiple scattering problem for electric point dipoles using the
rigorous Green's matrix theory, we demonstrate a clear transition from
diffusive transport to localization behavior. This is shown by studying the
Thouless number as a function of the scattering strength and the spectral
statistics of the scattering resonances. Surprisingly, despite the absence of
sharp diffraction peaks, clear spectral gaps are discovered in the density of
states of pinwheel arrays that manifest a distinctive long-range order.
Furthermore, the level spacing statistics at large optical density exhibits a
sharp transition from level repulsion to the Poisson behavior, consistently
with the onset of the wave localization regime. Our findings reveal the
importance of hyperuniform aperiodic structures with statistically isotropic
k-space for the engineering of enhanced light-matter interaction and
localization properties.

safe planing and navigation in cluttered environments. The main challenges for
multi-object tracking (MOT) in autonomous driving applications reside in the
inherent uncertainties regarding the number of objects, when and where the
objects may appear and disappear, and uncertainties regarding objects' states.
Random finite set (RFS) based approaches can naturally model these
uncertainties accurately and elegantly, and they have been widely used in
radar-based tracking applications. In this work, we developed an RFS-based MOT
framework for 3D LiDAR data. In partiuclar, we propose a Poisson
multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter to solve the amodal MOT problem for
autonomous driving applications. To the best of our knowledge, this represents
a first attempt for employing an RFS-based approach in conjunction with 3D
LiDAR data for MOT applications with comprehensive validation using challenging
datasets made available by industry leaders. The superior experimental results
of our PMBM tracker on public Waymo and Argoverse datasets clearly illustrate
that an RFS-based tracker outperforms many state-of-the-art deep learning-based
and Kalman filter-based methods, and consequently, these results indicate a
great potential for further exploration of RFS-based frameworks for 3D MOT
applications.

sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154
seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge
all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a
single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only
come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as
possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of
optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting
point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search
campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we
summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in
view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be
identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more
dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale
transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the
identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of
the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks
to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes

complementary observational strategy.

diverse domains are then exploited by IRM to more effectively generalize
regression-based models to data regions that lack support overlap. We show
gains over classical regression approaches to ITE estimation in settings when

both the attending clinician and policy makers. Furthermore, it would be
beneficial to detect such deviations in a manner proportional to the level of
the deviation, and not to simply use arbitrary cut-off values. In this study,
we introduce a new approach for automated guideline-based quality assessment of
the care process, the bidirectional knowledge-based assessment of compliance
(BiKBAC) method. Our BiKBAC methodology assesses the degree of compliance when
applying clinical guidelines, with respect to multiple different aspects of the
guideline (e.g., the guideline's process and outcome objectives). The
assessment is performed through a highly detailed, automated quality-assessment
retrospective analysis, which compares a formal representation of the guideline
and of its process and outcome intentions (we use the Asbru language for that
purpose) with the longitudinal electronic medical record of its continuous
application over a significant time period, using both a top-down and a
bottom-up approach, which we explain in detail. Partial matches of the data to
the process and to the outcome objectives are resolved using fuzzy temporal
logic. We also introduce the DiscovErr system, which implements the BiKBAC
approach, and present its detailed architecture. The DiscovErr system was
evaluated in a separate study in the type 2 diabetes management domain, by

effect of quantum coherence on the performance of the heat engine. We identify
analytically regions where coherence suppresses fluctuations, implying a
quantum advantage, as well as regions where fluctuations are enhanced by
coherence. This quantum effect cannot be anticipated from the off-diagonal
elements of the density matrix. Because the fluctuations are not encoded in the
steady state alone, TUR violations are a consequence of coherence that goes
beyond steady-state coherence. While the system violates the conventional TUR,
it adheres a recent formulation of a quantum TUR. We further show that
parameters where the engine operates close to the conventional limit are
prevalent and TUR violations in the quantum model not uncommon.

microresonator-based frequency combs (microcombs) that are broadband optical
frequency combs with repetition rates in the millimeter-wave to microwave
domain. Integrated microcombs can be manufactured using wafer-scale process and
have been applied in numerous applications. Most of these advances are based on
the harnessing of dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in optical microresonators
with anomalous group velocity dispersion (GVD). However, microcombs can also be
generated with normal GVD using dissipative localized structures that are
referred to as ""dark pulse"", ""switching wave"" or ""platicon"". Importantly, as
most materials feature intrinsic normal GVD, the requirement of dispersion
engineering is significantly relaxed for platicon generation. Therefore while
DKS microcombs require particular designs and fabrication processes, platicon
microcombs can be readily built using standard CMOS-compatible platforms such
as thin-film (i.e. typically below 300 nm) Si3N4. Yet laser self-injection
locking that has been recently used to create highly compact integrated DKS
microcomb modules has not been demonstrated for platicons. Here we report the
first fully integrated platicon microcomb operating at a microwave-K-band
repetition rate. Using laser self-injection locking of a DFB laser edge-coupled
to a Si3N4 microresonator, platicons are electrically initiated and stably
maintained, enabling a compact microcomb module without any complex control. We
further characterize the phase noise of the platicon repetition rate and the
pumping laser. The observation of self-injection-locked platicons facilitates
future wide adoption of microcombs as a build-in block in standard photonic
integrated architectures via commercial foundry service.

and a grounded conducting corrugated surface. For sinusoidal corrugations, one
knows that, under the action of the lateral vdW force, an isotropic particle is
always attracted to the nearest corrugation peak, with such behavior called in
the present paper as peak regime. Here, considering an anisotropic polarizable
particle, and making analytical calculations valid beyond the proximity force
approximation (PFA), we show that the attraction is not only toward the peaks,
but, for certain particle orientations and distances from the surface, the
lateral force attracts the particle to the nearest corrugation valley (valley
regime), or even to an intermediate point between a peak and a valley
(intermediate regime). We also show that in the configurations of transition
between the peak and valley regimes the lateral vdW force vanishes, even in the
presence of a corrugated surface. In addition, we find that these new regimes
occur in general, for periodic and nonperiodic corrugated surfaces. Moreover,
we demonstrate that similar regimes arise in the classical interaction between
a neutral polarized particle and a rough surface. The description of these
valley and intermediate regimes, which are out of reach of the predictions
based on the PFA, may be relevant for a better understanding of the interaction

quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) that originates from controlling a walker
population with a fluctuating shift parameter. This bias can become the
dominant error when the sign problem is absent, e.g. in bosonic systems. FCIQMC
is a powerful statistical method for obtaining information about the ground
state of a sparse and abstract matrix. We show that, when the sign problem is
absent, the shift estimator has the nice property of providing an upper bound
for the exact ground state energy and all projected energy estimators, while a
variational estimator is still an upper bound to the exact energy with
substantially reduced bias. A scalar model of the general FCIQMC population
dynamics leads to an exactly solvable It\^o stochastic differential equation.
It provides further insights into the nature of the bias and gives accurate
analytical predictions for delayed cross-covariance and auto-covariance
functions of the shift energy estimator and the walker number. The model
provides a toe-hold on finding a cure for the population control bias. We
provide evidence for non-universal power-law scaling of the population control
bias with walker number in the Bose-Hubbard model for various estimators of the
ground state energy based on the shift or on projected energies. For the
specific case of the non-interacting Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian we obtain a full
analytical prediction for the bias of the shift energy estimator.

accelerating its carbon neutrality and net-negative emissions goal from 2045 to

accelerating nature-based solutions on natural and working lands. It also means
changing its current greenhouse gas reduction goals both in the percentage and

SFGs, which contrasts with the positive correlation between the UV/optical size

compact in galaxies with high star-formation rates ($\rm SFR\gtrsim
100\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$), suggesting that a central, compact starburst (and/or
an Active Galactic Nucleus) resides in the most luminous galaxies of our

SFGs with $\log(M_\star/\rm M_\odot)>10$ increases by a factor of $1.5-2$ from
$z\approx 3$ to $z\approx0.3$, yet the radio emission remains two-to-three

manifested as noise in labeling, which makes the training and evaluation of ICD
classifiers difficult in presence of such noise. This paper investigates the
characteristics of such noise in manually-assigned ICD-10 codes and
furthermore, proposes a method to train robust ICD-10 classifiers in the
presence of labeling noise. Our research concluded that the nature of such
noise is systematic. Most of the existing methods for handling label noise
assume that the noise is completely random and independent of features or
labels, which is not the case for ICD data. Therefore, we develop a new method
for training robust classifiers in the presence of systematic noise. We first
identify ICD-10 codes that human coders tend to misuse or confuse, based on the
codes' locations in the ICD-10 hierarchy, the types of the codes, and baseline
classifier's prediction behaviors; we then develop a novel training strategy
that accounts for such noise. We compared our method with the baseline that
does not handle label noise and the baseline methods that assume random noise,
and demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms all baselines when

faint EUV coronal jets that are discernible in AIA 193 {\AA} images. The spires
of these jets are much fainter and usually narrower than for typical EUV jets
that have been observed to be produced by minifilament eruptions in quiet

resources play an essential role in efficiently meeting service requirements in
a smart city. In this regard, it is essential to learn the distribution of
resource demands in time and space. In this work, we first propose a
spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical learning approach to learn and predict
the distribution of MEC resource demand over space and time to facilitate MEC
deployment and resource management. Second, the proposed model is trained and
tested on real-world data, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve very high accuracy. Third, we demonstrate an application of the
proposed method by simulating task offloading. Finally, the simulated results
show that resources allocated based upon our models' predictions are exploited
more efficiently than the resources are equally divided into all servers in
unobserved areas.

so does the need to account for people during planning. To plan effectively,
robots must be able to respond to and sometimes influence what humans do. This
requires a human model which predicts future human actions. A simple model may
assume the human will continue what they did previously; a more complex one
might predict that the human will act optimally, disregarding the robot;
whereas an even more complex one might capture the robot's ability to influence
the human. These models make different trade-offs between computational time
and performance of the resulting robot plan. Using only one model of the human
either wastes computational resources or is unable to handle critical
situations. In this work, we give the robot access to a suite of human models
and enable it to assess the performance-computation trade-off online. By
estimating how an alternate model could improve human prediction and how that
may translate to performance gain, the robot can dynamically switch human
models whenever the additional computation is justified. Our experiments in a
driving simulator showcase how the robot can achieve performance comparable to
always using the best human model, but with greatly reduced computation.

at which a neuron spikes on the basis of calcium imaging data. However,
quantifying the uncertainty associated with these estimated spikes remains an
open problem. We consider a simple and well-studied model for calcium imaging
data, which states that calcium decays exponentially in the absence of a spike,
and instantaneously increases when a spike occurs. We wish to test the null
hypothesis that the neuron did not spike -- i.e., that there was no increase in
calcium -- at a particular timepoint at which a spike was estimated. In this
setting, classical hypothesis tests lead to inflated Type I error, because the
spike was estimated on the same data used for testing. To overcome this
problem, we propose a selective inference approach. We describe an efficient
algorithm to compute finite-sample p-values that control selective Type I
error, and confidence intervals with correct selective coverage, for spikes
estimated using a recent proposal from the literature. We apply our proposal in
simulation and on calcium imaging data from the spikefinder challenge.

be potentially integrated into the onboard Detect and Avoid (DAA) computer of
an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). We consider a UAS that can be fully
controlled by the onboard DAA system and by a remote human pilot. With a
communication channel prone to latency, we consider a mixed initiative
interaction environment, where the control authority of the UAS is dynamically
allocated by the allocation agent. In an encounter with a dynamic intruder, the
probability of collision may increase in the absence of pilot commands in the
presence of latency. Moreover, a delayed pilot command may not result in safe
resolution of the current scenario and need to be improvised. We design an
optimization algorithm to reduce collision risk and refine delayed pilot
commands. Towards this end, a Markov Decision Process (MDP)and its solution are
employed to create a wait time map. The map consists of estimated times that
the UAS can wait for the remote pilot commands at each state. A command
blending algorithm is designed to select an avoidance maneuver that prioritizes
the pilot intention extracted from the pilot commands. The wait time map and
the command blending algorithm are implemented and integrated into a
closed-loop simulator. We conduct ten thousands fast-time Monte Carlo
simulations and compare the performance of the integrated setup with a
standalone DAA setup. The simulation results show that the allocation agent
enables the UAS to wait without inducing any near mid air collision (NMAC) and
severe loss of well clear (LoWC) while positively improve pilot involvement in
the encounter resolution.

apart than the atomic scale of size $\varepsilon$, this model breaks down and
blows up when the segments are $O(\varepsilon)$ apart. To separate the nonlocal

Existing pre-training methods either directly concatenate image representation
and text representation at a feature level as input to a single-stream
Transformer, or use a two-stream cross-modal Transformer to align the
image-text representation at a high-level semantic space. In real-world
image-text data, we observe that it is easy for some of the image-text pairs to
align simple semantics on both modalities, while others may be related after
higher-level abstraction. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new
pre-training method SemVLP, which jointly aligns both the low-level and

pre-trained iteratively with two prevalent fashions: single-stream pre-training
to align at a fine-grained feature level and two-stream pre-training to align
high-level semantics, by employing a shared Transformer network with a
pluggable cross-modal attention module. An extensive set of experiments have

the sum-GDoF value is characterized for the $2\times 2\times 2$ setting that is
comprised of $2$ sources, $2$ relays, and $2$ destinations. It is shown that
the sum-GDoF do not improve even if perfect CSIT is allowed in the first hop,
as long as the CSIT in the second hop is limited to finite precision. The sum
GDoF characterization is then generalized to the $2\times 2\times \cdots \times

value approaches that of the one hop broadcast channel that is obtained by full
cooperation among the two transmitters of the last hop, with finite precision
CSIT. Previous studies of multi-hop interference networks either identified
sophisticated GDoF optimal schemes under perfect CSIT, such as aligned
interference neutralization and network diagonalization, that are powerful in
theory but too fragile to be practical, or studied robust achievable schemes
like classical amplify/decode/compress-and-forward without claims of
information-theoretic optimality. In contrast, under finite precision CSIT, we
show that the benefits of fragile schemes are lost, while a combination of
classical random coding schemes that are simpler and much more robust, namely a
rate-splitting between decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward, is shown to
be GDoF optimal. As such, this work represents another step towards bridging
the gap between theory (optimality) and practice (robustness) with the aid of

understand the sentiment involved and hence to predict the most suitable emoji
for the text. Hashtags and Application Sources like Android, etc. are two
features which we found to be important yet underused in emoji prediction and
Twitter sentiment analysis on the whole. To approach this shortcoming and to
further understand emoji behavioral patterns, we propose a more balanced
dataset by crawling additional Twitter data, including timestamp, hashtags, and
application source acting as additional attributes to the tweet. Our data

hashtags and application sources as features allows to encode different

sufficiently cold compared to the peak of the fusion cross-section, anisotropic

surfaces for hyperbolic conservation laws is a basic problem in the nonlinear
partial differential equations. In this paper, we are concerned with the shock
formation and the optimal regularities of the resulting shock curves for the
1-D conservation law $\partial_tu+\partial_xf(u)=0$ with the smooth initial
data $u(0,x)=u_0(x)$. If $u_0(x)\in C^{1}(\Bbb R)$ and $f(u)\in C^2(\Bbb R)$,
it is well-known that the solution $u$ will blow up on the time
$T^*=-\frac{1}{\min{g'(x)}}$ when $\min{g'(x)}<0$ holds for $g(x)=f'(u_0(x))$.
Let $x_0$ be a local minimum point of $g'(x)$ such that $g'(x_0)=\min{g'(x)}<0$
and $g''(x_0)=0$, $g^{(3)}(x_0)>0$ (which is called the generic nondegenerate
condition), then by Theorem 2 of \cite{Le94}, a weak entropy solution $u$
together with the shock curve $x=\varphi(t)\in C^2[T^*, T^*+\varepsilon)$
starting from the blowup point $(T^*, x^*=x_0+g(x_0)T^*)$ can be locally
constructed. When the generic nondegenerate condition is violated, namely, when
$x_0$ is a local minimum point of $g'(x)$ such that
$g''(x_0)=g^{(3)}(x_0)=...=g^{(2k_0)}(x_0)=0$ but $g^{(2k_0+1)}(x_0)>0$ for
some $k_0\in\Bbb N$ with $k_0\ge 2$; or $g^{(k)}(x_0)=0$ for any $k\in\Bbb N$
and $k\ge 2$, we will study the shock formation and the optimal regularity of
the shock curve $x=\varphi(t)$, meanwhile, some precise descriptions on the
behaviors of $u$ near the blowup point $(T^*, x^*)$ are given. Our main aims
are to show that: around the blowup point, the shock really appears whether the
initial data are degenerate with finite orders or with infinite orders; the
optimal regularities of the shock solution and the resulting shock curve have
the explicit relations with the degenerate degrees of the initial data.

geometric correspondence from incomplete shapes to complete shapes, and ignore
the learning in the reverse direction, which makes them suffer from low
completion accuracy due to the limited 3D shape understanding ability. To
address this problem, we propose two simultaneous cycle transformations between
the latent spaces of complete shapes and incomplete ones. The insight of cycle
transformation is to promote networks to understand 3D shapes by learning to
generate complete or incomplete shapes from their complementary ones.
Specifically, the first cycle transforms shapes from incomplete domain to
complete domain, and then projects them back to the incomplete domain. This
process learns the geometric characteristic of complete shapes, and maintains
the shape consistency between the complete prediction and the incomplete input.
Similarly, the inverse cycle transformation starts from complete domain to
incomplete domain, and goes back to complete domain to learn the characteristic
of incomplete shapes. We provide a comprehensive evaluation in experiments,
which shows that our model with the learned bidirectional geometry
correspondence outperforms state-of-the-art unpaired completion methods.

searcher to find a target, which is called an extreme FHT. In this paper, we
study extreme FHTs for any stochastic process that is a random time change of
Brownian motion by a Levy subordinator. This class of stochastic processes
includes superdiffusive Levy flights in any space dimension, which are
processes described by a Fokker-Planck equation with a fractional Laplacian. We
find the short-time distribution of a single FHT for any Levy subordinate
Brownian motion and use this to find the full distribution and moments of
extreme FHTs as the number of searchers grows. We illustrate these rigorous
results in several examples and numerical simulations.

applications, including image classification, text generation, audio
recognition, and graph data analysis. However, recent studies have shown that
ML models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to
infer whether a data record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on ML
models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the
fact that a clinical record that has been used to train a model associated with
a certain disease, an attacker can infer that the owner of the clinical record
has the disease with a high chance. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be
effective on various ML models, e.g., classification models and generative
models. Meanwhile, many defense methods have been proposed to mitigate MIAs.
Although MIAs on ML models form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research
area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this paper, we
conduct the first comprehensive survey on membership inference attacks and
defenses. We provide the taxonomies for both attacks and defenses, based on
their characterizations, and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the
limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising
future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this
area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but
also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain.
To further help the researchers, we have created an online resource repository,

investigate an on-disk prominence bubble around a filament barb on 2019 March
18 based on stereoscopic observations from NVST, SDO, and STEREO-A. In
high-resolution NVST H$\alpha$ images, this bubble has a sharp arch-like
boundary and a projected width of $\thicksim$26 Mm. Combining SDO and STEREO-A
images, we further reconstruct 3D structure of the bubble boundary, whose
maximum height is $\thicksim$15.6 Mm. The squashing factor Q map deduced from
extrapolated 3D magnetic fields around the bubble depicts a distinct
arch-shaped interface with a height of $\thicksim$11 Mm, which agrees well with
the reconstructed 3D structure of the observed bubble boundary. Under the
interface lies a set of magnetic loops, which is rooted on a surrounding
photospheric magnetic patch. To be more persuasive, another on-disk bubble on
2019 June 10 is presented as a supplement. According to these results obtained
from on-disk bubble observations, we suggest that the bubble boundary
corresponds to the interface between the prominence dips (barb) and the
underlying magnetic loops rooted nearby. It is thus reasonable to speculate
that the bubble can form around a filament barb below which there is a
photospheric magnetic patch.

conclusions may well be correct, the observed lack of dependence of the
measured distributions on the electron's transverse coherence length should
have been expected for the parameters chosen. This is because for Smith-Purcell
radiation it is the coherence length of a virtual photon that plays a role of
the radiation formation width and not the entire electron's coherence length
that can well be orders of magnitude larger. This is a common feature for all
the radiation processes in which a photon is emitted not directly by the
electron, which can be delocalized in space, but rather by a much better
localized atom or a conduction electron on a surface. Therefore, in our opinion
the results of Remez et al. cannot rule out the alternative hypothesis of the
delocalized charge. The question, mainly addressed in the comment by Karnieli
et al., of whether the measurements were performed in the wave zone or not is
interesting but secondary. We emphasize that the measured distributions are
unusually wide and neither the original paper nor the recent comment fully
discusses and rules out all alternative hypotheses that could have led to the
same distributions. On the contrary, there exists a family of classical effects
that could also have resulted in the measured distributions and that were
neither discussed nor even mentioned by the authors. Such alternative
hypotheses include (i) effects of the beam sizes, of its angular divergence, of
the temporal coherence of the process, and (ii) influence of the grating shape
and of its material. Finally, we propose to repeat the experiment and to
measure diffraction radiation from a thin metallic semi-plane or Compton
emission in a laser pulse. In these cases, the classical effects play a much
smaller role and the results of such measurements would have higher
credibility.

the twofold reduction of the effective magnetic field at the edges of the

key process in natural language processing. While word-level language models

probability estimation (SPE). To overcome this, recent studies introduced
training methods using sentence-level noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) with
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this work, we attempt to extend it for
contextual SPE, which aims to estimate a conditional sentence probability given
a previous text. The proposed NCE samples negative sentences independently of a
previous text so that the trained model gives higher probabilities to the
sentences that are more consistent with \textcolor{blue}{the} context. We apply
our method to a simple word-level RNN LM to focus on the effect of the
sentence-level NCE training rather than on the network architecture. The
quality of estimation was evaluated against multiple-choice cloze-style
questions including both human and automatically generated questions. The
experimental results show that the proposed method improved the SPE quality for

conditions. We finally use the technique of limiting spectra to optimize for a
very large number of subdomains in a strip decomposition. Our analysis shows
that the asymptotically best choice of transmission conditions is the same in
all these situations, only the constants differ slightly. It is therefore
enough for such diffusive type approximations of Maxwell's equations, which
include the special case of the Laplace and screened Laplace equation, to
optimize transmission parameters in the simplified two subdomain decomposition

actomyosin complex, the distribution of the myosin motors becomes
microscopically uniform (all the motors are either in pre- or post-power stroke
conformation) after an infinitesimal displacement from the stall (isometric
contractions) conditions. Such uniform behavior at the fiber level would
generate a negative slope in the $T_2-\delta$ relationship (in the nomenclature

inhomogeneity of the macroscopic sarcomere configuration, which is also not
observed. To address this controversial prediction of the HS theory, we explore
the possibility that the slope of the $T_2-\delta$ curve is, in fact, positive
due to an interaction between neighboring cross-bridges. We show that such
interaction can potentially destabilize the uniform configurations (all pre or
all post) by making the non-uniform configurations energetically preferable. We
argue that, despite the presence of other factors, which can in principle also
ensure the microscopic inhomogeneity of cross-bridge configurations, the
implied interaction is an important player in muscle mechanics.

transfers mass to the secondary star and leaves a CO WD remnant. The secondary
becomes massive enough to end in a CCSN. As the secondary evolves to the RSG

prediction module is established based on the simplified single-track vehicle
model for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the decision-making
algorithm. Then, the cost function and constraints of the decision making are
designed considering multiple performance indexes, i.e. the safety, comfort and
efficiency. Besides, in order to realize human-like and personalized smart
mobility, different driving characteristics are considered and embedded in the
modeling process. Furthermore, four typical coalition models are defined for
CAVS at the scenario of a multi-lane merging zone. Then, the coalitional game
approach is formulated with model predictive control (MPC) to deal with
decision making of CAVs at the defined scenario. Finally, testings are carried
out in two cases considering different driving characteristics to evaluate the
performance of the developed approach. The testing results show that the
proposed coalitional game based method is able to make reasonable decisions and
adapt to different driving characteristics for CAVs at the multi-lane merging
zone. It guarantees the safety and efficiency of CAVs at the complex dynamic
traffic condition, and simultaneously accommodates the objectives of individual
vehicles, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

paper, we propose a novel proposal-based learnable framework, which models MOT
as a proposal generation, proposal scoring and trajectory inference paradigm on
an affinity graph. This framework is similar to the two-stage object detector
Faster RCNN, and can solve the MOT problem in a data-driven way. For proposal

computational cost while maintaining the quality of the generated proposals.
For proposal scoring, we deploy a trainable graph-convolutional-network (GCN)
to learn the structural patterns of the generated proposals and rank them
according to the estimated quality scores. For trajectory inference, a simple
deoverlapping strategy is adopted to generate tracking output while complying
with the constraints that no detection can be assigned to more than one track.

  Engineering",,,,"math.FA math.CA math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  String-averaging is an algorithmic structure used when handling a family of
operators in situations where the algorithm at hand requires to employ the
operators in a specific order. Sequential orderings are well-known and a
simultaneous order means that all operators are used simultaneously (in
parallel). String-averaging allows to use strings of indices, constructed by
subsets of the index set of all operators, to apply the operators along these
strings and then to combine their end-points in some agreed manner to yield the
next iterate of the algorithm. String-averaging methods were discussed and used
for solving the common fixed point problem or its important special case of the
convex feasibility problem. In this paper we propose and investigate
string-averaging methods for the problem of best approximation to the common
fixed point set of a family of operators. This problem involves finding a point
in the common fixed point set of a family of operators that is closest to a
given point, called an anchor point. We construct string-averaging methods for
solving the best approximation problem to the common fixed points set of either
finite or infinite families of firmly nonexpansive operators in a real Hilbert
space. We show that the simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittman-Bauschke algorithm,

labeled as string-averaging methods, are actually special cases of these

diverse images given the input conditions and latent codes, but unfortunately,
they usually suffer from the issue of mode collapse. To solve this issue,
previous works mainly focused on encouraging the correlation between the latent
codes and their generated images, while ignoring the relations between images
generated from various latent codes. The recent MSGAN tried to encourage the
diversity of the generated image but only considers ""negative"" relations
between the image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel DivCo framework to
properly constrain both ""positive"" and ""negative"" relations between the
generated images specified in the latent space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first attempt to use contrastive learning for diverse conditional
image synthesis. A novel latent-augmented contrastive loss is introduced, which
encourages images generated from adjacent latent codes to be similar and those
generated from distinct latent codes to be dissimilar. The proposed
latent-augmented contrastive loss is well compatible with various cGAN
architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DivCo can
produce more diverse images than state-of-the-art methods without sacrificing
visual quality in multiple unpaired and paired image generation tasks.

important research topic in recent years due to a sharp increase in induced
seismicity around the globe. The detection of low-magnitude seismic events is
essential for microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing, carbon capture
and storage, and geothermal operations for hazard detection and mitigation.
Moreover, the detection of micro-earthquakes is crucial to understand the
underlying mechanisms of larger earthquakes. Various algorithms, including deep
learning methods, have been proposed over the years to detect such
low-magnitude events. However, there is still a need for improving the
robustness of these methods in discriminating between local sources of noise
and weak seismic events. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural
network (CNN) to detect seismic events from shallow borehole stations in
Groningen, the Netherlands. We train a CNN model to detect low-magnitude
earthquakes, harnessing the multi-level sensor configuration of the G-network
in Groningen. Each G-network station contains four geophones at depths of 50,
100, 150, and 200 meters. Unlike prior deep learning approaches that use
3-component seismic records only at a single sensor level, we use records from
the entire borehole as one training example. This allows us to train the CNN
model using moveout patterns of the energy traveling across the borehole
sensors to discriminate between events originating in the subsurface and local
noise arriving from the surface. We compare the prediction accuracy of our
trained CNN model to that of the STA/LTA and template matching algorithms on a
two-month continuous record. We demonstrate that the CNN model shows
significantly better performance than STA/LTA and template matching in
detecting new events missing from the catalog and minimizing false detections.

over long-term runs. In this paper, we present GVINS, a non-linear optimization
based system that tightly fuses GNSS raw measurements with visual and inertial
information for real-time and drift-free state estimation. Our system aims to
provide accurate global 6-DoF estimation under complex indoor-outdoor
environment where GNSS signals may be intermittent or even totally unavailable.
To connect global measurements with local states, a coarse-to-fine
initialization procedure is proposed to efficiently calibrate the
transformation online and initialize GNSS states from only a short window of
measurements. The GNSS code pseudorange and Doppler shift measurements, along
with visual and inertial information, are then modelled and used to constrain
the system states in a factor graph framework. For complex and GNSS-unfriendly
areas, the degenerate cases are discussed and carefully handled to ensure
robustness. Thanks to the tightly-coupled multi-sensor approach and system
design, our system fully exploits the merits of three types of sensors and is
capable to seamlessly cope with the transition between indoor and outdoor
environments, where satellites are lost and reacquired. We extensively evaluate
the proposed system by both simulation and real-world experiments, and the
result demonstrates that our system substantially eliminates the drift of VIO
and preserves the local accuracy in spite of noisy GNSS measurements. The
challenging indoor-outdoor and urban driving experiments verify the
availability and robustness of GVINS in complex environments. In addition,
experiments also show that our system can gain from even a single satellite
while conventional GNSS algorithms need four at least.

applying contractile forces that are in turn transmitted to distant cells. We
calculate the mechanical work that each cell performs in order to deform the
matrix, and study how that energy changes when a contracting cell is surrounded
by other cells with similar properties and behavior. We consider simple
effective geometries for the spatial arrangement of cells, with spherical and
with cylindrical symmetries, and model the presence of neighboring cells by
imposing zero-displacement at some distance from the cell, which represents the
surface of symmetry between neighboring cells. In linear elastic matrices, we
analytically study the dependence of the resulting interaction energy on the
geometry and on the stiffness and regulatory behavior of the cells. For cells
that regulate the active stress that they apply, in spherical geometry, the
deformation inside the cell is pure compression thus the interaction depends
only on their bulk modulus, while in cylindrical geometries the deformation
includes also shear and the interaction depends also on their shear modulus. In
nonlinear, strain stiffening matrices, our numerical solutions and analytical
approximations show how in the presence of other cells, cell contraction is
limited due to the divergence of the shear stress.

promising technique for beyond 5G. In this work, we propose a powerful and
unified multi-antenna DFRC transmission framework, where an additional radar
sequence is transmitted apart from communication streams to enhance radar
beampattern matching capability, and Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is
adopted to better manage the interference. RSMA relies on multi-antenna
Rate-Splitting (RS) with Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers,
and the split and encoding of messages into common and private streams. We
design the message split and the precoders of the radar sequence and
communication streams to jointly maximize the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) and
minimize the radar beampattern approximation Mean Square Error (MSE) subject to
the per antenna power constraint. An iterative algorithm based on Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the problem.
Numerical results first show that RSMA-assisted DFRC achieves a better tradeoff
between WSR and beampattern approximation than Space-Division Multiple Access
(SDMA)-assisted DFRC with or without radar sequence, and other simpler
radar-communication strategies using orthogonal resources. We also show that
the RSMA-assisted DFRC frameworks with and without radar sequence achieve the
same tradeoff performance. This is because that the common stream is better
exploited in the proposed framework. The common stream of RSMA fulfils the
triple function of managing interference among communication users, managing
interference between communication and radar, and beampattern approximation.
Therefore, by enabling RSMA in DFRC, the system performance is enhanced while
the system architecture is simplified since there is no need to use additional
radar sequence and SIC. We conclude that RSMA is a more powerful multiple
access for DFRC.

The solid field is assumed to consist of several arbitrarily-shaped,
undeformable but mobile rigid bodies, that are evolved in time individually and
allowed to get into mechanical contact with each other. The fluid field
generally consists of multiple liquid or gas phases. All fields are spatially
discretized using the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). This
approach is especially suitable in the context of continually changing
interface topologies and dynamic phase transitions without the need for
additional methodological and computational effort for interface tracking as
compared to mesh- or grid-based methods. Proposing a concept for the
parallelization of the computational framework, in particular concerning a
computationally efficient evaluation of rigid body motion, is an essential part
of this work. Finally, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated by several numerical examples in two and three dimensions,
involving multiple rigid bodies, two-phase flow, and reversible phase
transitions, with a focus on two potential application scenarios in the fields
of engineering and biomechanics: powder bed fusion additive manufacturing

of the parallel computational framework is demonstrated by a strong scaling

framework, a code is specified by some ideals in a polynomial ring, messages
are polynomials and their encoding is the residue modulo the ideals. We present
an alternate way of viewing this class of codes in terms of linear operators,
and show that this alternate view makes their algorithmic list-decodability
amenable to analysis. Our framework leads to a new class of codes that we call
affine Folded Reed-Solomon codes (which are themselves a special case of the
broader class we explore). These codes are common generalizations of the
well-studied Folded Reed-Solomon codes and Multiplicity codes, while also
capturing the less-studied Additive Folded Reed-Solomon codes as well as a
large family of codes that were not previously known/studied.
  More significantly our framework also captures the algorithmic
list-decodability of the constituent codes. Specifically, we present a unified
view of the decoding algorithm for ideal theoretic codes and show that the
decodability reduces to the analysis of the distance of some related codes. We
show that good bounds on this distance lead to capacity-achieving performance
of the underlying code, providing a unifying explanation of known
capacity-achieving results. In the specific case of affine Folded Reed-Solomon
codes, our framework shows that they are list-decodable up to capacity (for

Connectivity. This paper focuses on the performance evaluation of the
clustering approach performance in detecting wireless coverage services with
improving energy efficiency. The evaluation performance is a realistic
simulation for the ground to air channel Line of Sight (LoS). The results show
that the cluster head can effectively link the UAVs and cluster members at

user devices for detecting wireless coverage. Moreover, the bit error rate in
the cluster heads is considered for reliable Connectivity in post disaster.
Clustering stabilizes the clusters linking the uncovered nodes to the UAV, and

has suggested Mlo is approximately 50 solar masses and Mhi is approximately 130

observations that show many black holes merging with individual masses, Mlo is
least some 65 solar masses. Here we explore four factors affecting the
theoretical estimates for the boundaries of this mass gap: nuclear reaction
rates, evolution in detached binaries, rotation, and hyper-Eddington accretion
after black hole birth. Current uncertainties in reaction rates by themselves
allow Mlo to rise to 64 solar masses and Mhi as large as 161 solar masses.
Rapid rotation could further increase Mlo to about 70 solar masses, depending
on the treatment of magnetic torques. Evolution in detached binaries and
super-Eddington accretion can, with great uncertainty, increase Mlo still
further. Dimensionless Kerr parameters close to unity are allowed for the more
massive black holes produced in close binaries, though they are generally
smaller.

found a surprising lack of work on computing the non-linearity of a function.
The non-linearity is related to the Walsh coefficient with the largest absolute
value; however, the naive attempt of picking the maximum after constructing a
Walsh spectrum requires $\Theta(2^n)$ queries to an $n$-bit function. We
improve the scenario by designing highly efficient quantum and randomised
algorithms to approximate the non-linearity allowing additive error, denoted
$\lambda$, with query complexities that depend polynomially on $\lambda$. We
prove lower bounds to show that these are not very far from the optimal ones.
The number of queries made by our randomised algorithm is linear in $n$,
already an exponential improvement, and the number of queries made by our
quantum algorithm is surprisingly independent of $n$. Our randomised algorithm
uses a Goldreich-Levin style of navigating all Walsh coefficients and our

fundamental task in remote sensing image analysis. Along with rapid development
in sensor technologies, remotely sensed images can be captured at multiple
spatial resolutions (MSR) with information content manifested at different
scales. Extracting information from these MSR images represents huge
opportunities for enhanced feature representation and characterisation.
However, MSR images suffer from two critical issues: 1) increased scale
variation of geo-objects and 2) loss of detailed information at coarse spatial
resolutions. To bridge these gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel
scale-aware neural network (SaNet) for semantic segmentation of MSR remotely
sensed imagery. SaNet deploys a densely connected feature network (DCFFM)
module to capture high-quality multi-scale context, such that the scale
variation is handled properly and the quality of segmentation is increased for
both large and small objects. A spatial feature recalibration (SFRM) module is
further incorporated into the network to learn intact semantic content with
enhanced spatial relationships, where the negative effects of information loss
are removed. The combination of DCFFM and SFRM allows SaNet to learn
scale-aware feature representation, which outperforms the existing multi-scale
feature representation. Extensive experiments on three semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SaNet in
cross-resolution segmentation.

significant success recently, they still exist two major drawbacks. Firstly,
most of them do not sufficiently model the characteristics of rain layers of
rainy videos. In fact, the rain layers exhibit strong physical properties
(e.g., direction, scale and thickness) in spatial dimension and natural
continuities in temporal dimension, and thus can be generally modelled by the
spatial-temporal process in statistics. Secondly, current DL-based methods
seriously depend on the labeled synthetic training data, whose rain types are
always deviated from those in unlabeled real data. Such gap between synthetic
and real data sets leads to poor performance when applying them in real
scenarios. Against these issues, this paper proposes a new semi-supervised
video deraining method, in which a dynamic rain generator is employed to fit
the rain layer, expecting to better depict its insightful characteristics.
Specifically, such dynamic generator consists of one emission model and one
transition model to simultaneously encode the spatially physical structure and
temporally continuous changes of rain streaks, respectively, which both are
parameterized as deep neural networks (DNNs). Further more, different prior
formats are designed for the labeled synthetic and unlabeled real data, so as
to fully exploit the common knowledge underlying them. Last but not least, we
also design a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to solve this model. Extensive

reward-free Markov decision process. It provides explicit near-optimal policies
for any reward specified a posteriori. During an unsupervised phase, we use
reward-free interactions with the environment to learn two representations via
off-the-shelf deep learning methods and temporal difference (TD) learning. In
the test phase, a reward representation is estimated either from observations
or an explicit reward description (e.g., a target state). The optimal policy
for that reward is directly obtained from these representations, with no
planning. We assume access to an exploration scheme or replay buffer for the
first phase.
  The corresponding unsupervised loss is well-principled: if training is
perfect, the policies obtained are provably optimal for any reward function.
With imperfect training, the sub-optimality is proportional to the unsupervised
approximation error. The FB representation learns long-range relationships
between states and actions, via a predictive occupancy map, without having to
synthesize states as in model-based approaches.
  This is a step towards learning controllable agents in arbitrary black-box
stochastic environments. This approach compares well to goal-oriented RL
algorithms on discrete and continuous mazes, pixel-based MsPacman, and the

studied for their phase stability for a wide temperature range (100 K to 2000
K). The equilibrium thermodynamic phases are determined by the changes in
enthalpy and entropy. The enthalpy changes at any temperature are simulated by
embedded atom method (EAM) potential based hybrid Monte Carlo molecular
dynamics (MC/MD) simulations. Configurational entropy was calculated by
quasichemical method. The EAM potentials were all calculated based on the
physical input parameters of elements like atomic volume, cohesive energy,
elastic constants etc. It was found that the MC/MD evolved equilibrium
structures and the degree of local chemical short-range order/clustering
(SRO/SRC) largely depend on the ordering enthalpies for various temperatures.
The ordering transition temperature is close to 700 K, which is also
substantiated by the experimental powder X-ray diffractions done in synchrotron
beam. Large increase of degree of next-neighbor B2-type ordering of Mo-Ta pairs
and decrease of that Nb-W pairs were observed. This was also expected from the
trends of density functional theory (DFT) based ab-initio simulations done in
the literature and discussed in this work. The simulated diffraction pattern
and changes in scattering intensity due to the chemical SRO and SRC was
investigated. The diffraction trends were explained with the help of the
features of the evolved nanostructure morphology. The developed methodologies
may be helpful in prior prediction of long-term phase stability in
multi-element alloys by reducing the number of costly experiments.

causes them to behave towards the power grid like synchronous generators. A
popular way to realize such inverters are synchronverters. Their control
algorithm has evolved over time, but all the different formulations in the
literature share the same ""basic control algorithm"". We investigate the
equilibrium points and the stability of a synchronverter described by this
basic algorithm, when connected to an infinite bus. We formulate a fifth order
model for a grid-connected synchronverter and derive a necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of equilibrium points. We show that the set of
equilibrium points with positive field current is a two-dimensional manifold
that can be parametrized by the corresponding pair $(P,Q)$, where $P$ is the
active power and $Q$ is the reactive power. This parametrization has several
surprizing geometric properties, for instance, the prime mover torque, the
power angle and the field current can be seen directly as distances or angles
in the $(P,Q)$ plane. In addition, the stable equilibrium points correspond to
a subset of a certain angular sector in the $(P,Q)$ plane. Thus, we can predict
the stable operating range of a synchronverter from its parameters and from the
grid voltage and frequency. Our stability result is based on the intrinsic two
time scales property of the system, using tools from singular perturbation
theory. We illustrate our theoretical results with two numerical examples.

consequences. To tackle the unclearness from black-box models, interpretability
became a fundamental requirement in DL-based systems, leveraging trust and
knowledge by providing ways to understand the model's behavior. Although a
current hot topic, further advances are still needed to overcome the existing
limitations of the current interpretability methods in unsupervised DL-based

unsupervised DL-based for AD applications, achieving best-in-class performance.
However, due to their hybrid aspect to obtain the results (by requiring
additional calculations out of network), only agnostic interpretable methods
can be applied to AE-based AD. These agnostic methods are computationally
expensive to process a large number of parameters. In this paper we present the

precisely, it presents the basics of a theory of contextuality called
Contextuality-by-Default (CbD). One of the main tenets of CbD is that the
identity of a random variable is determined not only by its content (that which
is measured or responded to) but also by contexts, systematically recorded
conditions under which the variable is observed; and the variables in different
contexts possess no joint distributions. I explain why this principle has no
paradoxical consequences, and why it does not support the holistic ""everything
depends on everything else"" view. Contextuality is defined as the difference
between two differences: (1) the difference between content-sharing random
variables when taken in isolation, and (2) the difference between the same
random variables when taken within their contexts. Contextuality thus defined
is a special form of context-dependence rather than a synonym for the latter.
The theory applies to any empirical situation describable in terms of random
variables. Deterministic situations are trivially noncontextual in CbD, but
some of them can be described by systems of epistemic random variables, in
which random variability is replaced with epistemic uncertainty.
Mathematically, such systems are treated as if they were ordinary systems of
random variables.

pressure can halt accretion, preventing further growth of a central star. Disk
accretion has been proposed to solve this problem, but the disks and the
accretion process in high-mass star formation are poorly understood. We
executed high-resolution ($R$=35,000-70,000) iSHELL spectroscopy in $K$-band
for eleven high-mass protostars. Br-$\gamma$ emission was observed toward eight
sources, and the line profiles for most of these sources are similar to those
of low-mass PMS stars. Using an empirical relationship between the Br-$\gamma$
and accretion luminosities, we tentatively estimate disk accretion rates
ranging from $\lesssim$10$^{-8}$ and $\sim$10$^{-4}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. These
low-mass-accretion rates suggest that high-mass protostars gain more mass via
episodic accretion as proposed for low-mass protostars. Given the detection
limits, CO overtone emission ($v$=2-0 and 3-1), likely associated with the
inner disk region ($r \ll 100$ au), was found towards two sources. This
low-detection rate compared with Br-$\gamma$ emission is consistent with
previous observations. Ten out of the eleven sources show absorption at the
$v$=0-2 ${\rm R(7)-R(14)}$ CO R-branch. Most of them are either blueshifted or
redshifted, indicating that the absorption is associated with an outflow or an
inflow with a velocity of up to $\sim50$ km s$^{-1}$. Our analysis indicates
that the absorption layer is well thermalized (and therefore $n_{\mathrm H_2}

heterogeneous costs over a finite time horizon, in which each firm faces demand
for a single product in each period and coalitions can pool orders. The model
of cooperation works as follows: ordering channels and holding and backlogging
technologies are shared among the members of the coalitions. This implies that
each firm uses the best ordering channel and holding technology provided by the
participants in the consortium. That is, they purchase, hold inventory, pay
backlogged demand and make orders at the minimum cost of the coalition members.
Thus, firms aim at satisfying their demand over the planing horizon with
minimal operation cost. Our contribution is to show that there exist fair
allocations of the overall operation cost among the firms so that no group of
agents profit from leaving the consortium. Then we propose a parametric family
of cost allocations and provide sufficient conditions for this to be a stable
family against coalitional defections of firms. Finally, we focus on those

globally. In Kosova context, the Universities have found the transition from
teaching in class to online classes quite challenging. This study investigates
the transformation process from in-campus classes to online classes from the
technical perspective within five Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in
Kosovo. The data was collected using the qualitative methods and its analysis
followed the 3C Lichtman approach. The results show that each of the
Universities followed a different approach, by using either their limited
premises infrastructure or using additional cloud infrastructure.

  Replacement Surgery: Enhanced Bidirectional Maximum Correntropy Algorithm","27 pages","The International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer
  Assisted Surgery, 2020","10.1002/rcs.2154",,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Background and aim: Image registration and alignment are the main limitations
of augmented reality-based knee replacement surgery. This research aims to
decrease the registration error, eliminate outcomes that are trapped in local
minima to improve the alignment problems, handle the occlusion, and maximize
the overlapping parts. Methodology: markerless image registration method was
used for Augmented reality-based knee replacement surgery to guide and
visualize the surgical operation. While weight least square algorithm was used
to enhance stereo camera-based tracking by filling border occlusion in right to
left direction and non-border occlusion from left to right direction. Results:
This study has improved video precision to 0.57 mm~0.61 mm alignment error.
Furthermore, with the use of bidirectional points, for example, forwards and
backwards directional cloud point, the iteration on image registration was
decreased. This has led to improve the processing time as well. The processing
time of video frames was improved to 7.4~11.74 fps. Conclusions: It seems clear
that this proposed system has focused on overcoming the misalignment difficulty
caused by movement of patient and enhancing the AR visualization during knee
replacement surgery. The proposed system was reliable and favorable which helps
in eliminating alignment error by ascertaining the optimal rigid transformation
between two cloud points and removing the outliers and non-Gaussian noise. The
proposed augmented reality system helps in accurate visualization and
navigation of anatomy of knee such as femur, tibia, cartilage, blood vessels,
etc.

samples from complex multimodal distributions. Unfortunately, current
approaches are only available for the most basic geometries and fall short when
the underlying space has a nontrivial topology, limiting their applicability
for most real-world data. Using fundamental ideas from differential geometry
and geometric control theory, we describe how the recently introduced Neural
ODEs and continuous normalizing flows can be extended to arbitrary smooth
manifolds. We propose a general methodology for parameterizing vector fields on
these spaces and demonstrate how gradient-based learning can be performed.
Additionally, we provide a scalable unbiased estimator for the divergence in
this generalized setting. Experiments on a diverse selection of spaces
empirically showcase the defined framework's ability to obtain
reparameterizable samples from complex distributions.
