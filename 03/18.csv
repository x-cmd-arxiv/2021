revisiting various data augmentation techniques as an effective way to prevent
discriminator overfitting. It is still unclear, however, that which
augmentations could actually improve GANs, and in particular, how to apply a
wider range of augmentations in training. In this paper, we propose a novel way
to address these questions by incorporating a recent contrastive representation
learning scheme into the GAN discriminator, coined ContraD. This ""fusion""
enables the discriminators to work with much stronger augmentations without
increasing their training instability, thereby preventing the discriminator
overfitting issue in GANs more effectively. Even better, we observe that the
contrastive learning itself also benefits from our GAN training, i.e., by
maintaining discriminative features between real and fake samples, suggesting a
strong coherence between the two worlds: good contrastive representations are
also good for GAN discriminators, and vice versa. Our experimental results show
that GANs with ContraD consistently improve FID and IS compared to other recent
techniques incorporating data augmentations, still maintaining highly
discriminative features in the discriminator in terms of the linear evaluation.
Finally, as a byproduct, we also show that our GANs trained in an unsupervised
manner (without labels) can induce many conditional generative models via a
simple latent sampling, leveraging the learned features of ContraD. Code is
available at https://github.com/jh-jeong/ContraD.

biodiversity, their study is a key challenge. We specifically study
long-lasting extreme heat waves, which are among the most important for climate
impacts. Physics driven weather forecast systems or climate models can be used
to forecast their occurrence or predict their probability. The present work
explores the use of deep learning architectures, trained using outputs of a
climate model, as an alternative strategy to forecast the occurrence of extreme
long-lasting heatwaves. This new approach will be useful for several key
scientific goals which include the study of climate model statistics, building
a quantitative proxy for resampling rare events in climate models, study the
impact of climate change, and should eventually be useful for forecasting.
Fulfilling these important goals implies addressing issues such as class-size
imbalance that is intrinsically associated with rare event prediction,
assessing the potential benefits of transfer learning to address the nested
nature of extreme events (naturally included in less extreme ones). We train a
Convolutional Neural Network, using 1000 years of climate model outputs, with
large-class undersampling and transfer learning. From the observed snapshots of
the surface temperature and the 500 hPa geopotential height fields, the trained
network achieves significant performance in forecasting the occurrence of
long-lasting extreme heatwaves. We are able to predict them at three different
levels of intensity, and as early as 15 days ahead of the start of the event
(30 days ahead of the end of the event).

smallest minimum degree over all of the bipartite subgraphs of $G$ induced by
pairs of parts that correspond to edges of $F$. In [Triangle-factors in a
balanced blown-up triangle. Discrete Mathematics, 2000], Johansson proved that
if $G$ is a spanning subgraph of the blow-up of $C_3$ with parts of size $n$
and $\delta^*(G) \ge \frac{2}{3}n + \sqrt{n}$, then $G$ contains $n$
vertex-disjoint triangles, and presented the following conjecture of
H\""aggkvist: If $G$ is a spanning subgraph of the blow-up of $C_k$ with parts
of size $n$ and $\delta^*(G) \ge (1 + 1/k)n/2 + 1$, then $G$ contains $n$
vertex disjoint copies of $C_k$ such that each $C_k$ intersects each of the $k$
parts exactly once. The degree condition of this conjecture is tight when $k=3$
and cannot be strengthened by more than one when $k \ge 4$., A similar
conjecture was also made by Fischer in [Variants of the Hajnal-Szemer\'edi
Theorem. Journal of Graph Theory, 1999] and the triangle case was proved for
large $n$ by Magyar and Martin in [Tripartite version of the Corr\'adi-Hajnal

  In this paper, we prove this Conjecture asymptotically. We also pose a
conjecture which generalizes this result by allowing the minimum degree
conditions on the nonempty bipartite subgraphs induced by pairs of parts to
vary. Our second result supports this new conjecture by proving the triangle

extraction frameworks, the classic ensemble strategy may show inferior
performance while encountering the high homogeneity of the learnt
representation, which is caused by the nature of existing graph pooling
methods. To cope with this issue, we propose a diversified multiscale graph
learning model equipped with two core ingredients: a graph self-correction
(GSC) mechanism to generate informative embedded graphs, and a diversity
boosting regularizer (DBR) to achieve a comprehensive characterization of the
input graph. The proposed GSC mechanism compensates the pooled graph with the
lost information during the graph pooling process by feeding back the estimated
residual graph, which serves as a plug-in component for popular graph pooling
methods. Meanwhile, pooling methods enhanced with the GSC procedure encourage
the discrepancy of node embeddings, and thus it contributes to the success of
ensemble learning strategy. The proposed DBR instead enhances the ensemble
diversity at the graph-level embeddings by leveraging the interaction among
individual classifiers. Extensive experiments on popular graph classification
benchmarks show that the proposed GSC mechanism leads to significant
improvements over state-of-the-art graph pooling methods. Moreover, the
ensemble multiscale graph learning models achieve superior enhancement by
combining both GSC and DBR.

detect the presence of a target against a bright background more sensitively

vacuum consisting of signal and idler modes with a non-zero phase-sensitive
cross correlation, which serves as the signature for target detection, and a
zero phase-insensitive cross correlation, which means the modes produce no
fringes in second order interference. Here it is shown that applying
phase-sensitive amplification to the idler modes of a two-mode squeezed vacuum
results in a non-zero phase-insensitive cross correlation enabling reception by
a simple beam splitter and photodetectors. It is shown that quantum

the Type I right-censoring setting, when the censoring times are completely

which states the following: marginal coverage is approximately guaranteed if
either the censoring mechanism or the conditional survival function is
estimated well. Further, we demonstrate that the lower predictive bounds remain
valid and informative for other types of censoring. The validity and efficiency
of our procedure are demonstrated on synthetic data and real COVID-19 data from

biomedical image processing. Traditional methods for multi-instance learning
focus on designing feature aggregation methods and multi-instance classifiers,
where the aggregation operation is performed either in feature extraction or
learning phase. As deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve great success in image
processing via automatic feature learning, certain feature aggregation
mechanisms need to be incorporated into common DNN architecture for
multi-instance learning. Moreover, flexibility and reliability are crucial
considerations to deal with varying quality and number of instances.
  In this study, we propose a hierarchical aggregation network for
multi-instance learning, called HAMIL. The hierarchical aggregation protocol
enables feature fusion in a defined order, and the simple convolutional
aggregation units lead to an efficient and flexible architecture. We assess the
model performance on two microscopy image classification tasks, namely protein
subcellular localization using immunofluorescence images and gene annotation
using spatial gene expression images. The experimental results show that HAMIL
outperforms the state-of-the-art feature aggregation methods and the existing
models for addressing these two tasks. The visualization analyses also
demonstrate the ability of HAMIL to focus on high-quality instances.

investigate the dominant modes of variability in the basin.
Analysis/Observations: The domain experiences stronger South-westerly winds
from May to September and relatively weaker North-easterlies from November to
February. A strong negative Ekman pumping along the north coast of Indonesia is
observed during Summer. The transport of water across the straits of Andaman
and Nicobar Islands (ANI) is computed by simple mass balance and is found to be
in phase with the monthly averaged Mean Sea Level Anomalies (MSLA) of Andaman
Sea. There occurs high surface outflux through Great channel and Ten-Degree
channel in Summer. In April and October, rate of transport through the straits
is maximum. During the same months, meridional surface currents intensify along
the eastern boundary of the basin and are associated with signatures of
downwelling. Findings: Intense down welling occurs to the north coast of
Indonesia during Summer, locally forced by south-westerlies. There occurs large
influx of water into Andaman Sea between April and November through the straits
between the islands. Equatorial Wyrtki jets remotely force Kelvin waves of
downwelling nature in the basin during April and October. The circulation in
Andaman Sea is characterised by gyres or vortices, which is the manifestation
of Rossby waves of semi-annual mode. The basin has a characteristic 120-day
mode of westward propagating long Rossby wave packets which reflect from the
coast of ANI as eastward propagating short Rossby waves. Novelty: The first
attempt to completely describe the dynamics of Andaman Sea circulation
exclusively from observations.

study the PXP model in a strong staggered external field, which has been
proposed to manifest quasiparticle confinement in light of a mapping to a
lattice gauge theory. We characterize this confining regime using both
numerical exact diagonalization and perturbation theory around the strong-field

field, we find a second emergent symmetry that is special to the PXP model. The
interplay between these emergent symmetries and the Rydberg blockade constraint
dramatically slows down the system's dynamics beyond naive expectations. We
devise a nested Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory to properly account for
the new emergent symmetry and show that this treatment is essential to
understand the numerically observed relaxation time scales. We also discuss
connections to Hilbert space fragmentation and trace the origin of the new

hyperfine-structure effects. We determined abundances of Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce,
Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu for 424 thin- and 82 thick-disc stars. The sample of
thick-disc stars shows a clearly visible decrease in [Eu/Mg] with increasing
[Fe/H] compared to the thin-disc stars, bringing more evidence of a different
chemical evolution in these two Galactic components. Abundance correlation with
age slopes for the investigated thin-disc stars are slightly negative for the
majority of s-process dominated elements, while r-process dominated elements
have positive correlations. Our sample of thin-disc stars with ages spanning
from 0.1 to 9 Gyrs give the [Y/Mg]=0.022 ($\pm$0.015)-0.027 ($\pm$0.003)*age
[Gyr] relation. For the thick-disc stars, when we also took data from other
studies into account, we found that [Y/Mg] cannot serve as an age indicator.
The radial [El/Fe] gradients in the thin disc are negligible for the s-process
dominated elements and become positive for the r-process dominated elements.
The vertical gradients are negative for the light s-process dominated elements
and become positive for the r-process dominated elements. In the thick disc,
the radial [El/Fe] slopes are negligible, and the vertical slopes are
predominantly negative.

transitions in physics. The vicinity of the transition is believed to host
exotic states of matter such as quantum spin liquids, exciton condensates and
unconventional superconductivity. Semiconductor moir\'e materials realize a

a unique opportunity to drive a metal-insulator transition (MIT) via continuous
tuning of the electronic interactions. Here, by electrically tuning the
effective interaction strength in MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e superlattices, we observe
a continuous MIT at a fixed filling of one electron per unit cell. The
existence of quantum criticality is supported by the scaling behavior of the
resistance, a continuously vanishing charge-gap as the critical point is
approached from the insulating side, and a diverging quasiparticle effective
mass from the metallic side. We also observe a smooth evolution of the
low-temperature magnetic susceptibility across the MIT and find no evidence of
long-range magnetic order down to ~ 5% of the Curie-Weiss temperature. The
results signal an abundance of low-energy spinful excitations on the insulating
side that is further corroborated by the presence of the Pomeranchuk effect on
the metallic side. Our results are consistent with the universal critical
theory of a continuous MIT from a Landau Fermi liquid to a nonmagnetic Mott

increased the demand of energy researchers, policymakers and energy planners
for reliable data on the spatial distribution of their costs and potentials.
For onshore wind energy this has resulted in an active research field devoted
to analysing these resources for regions, countries or globally. A particular
thread of this research attempts to go beyond purely technical or spatial
restrictions and determine the realistic, feasible or actual potential for wind
energy. Motivated by these developments, this paper reviews methods and
assumptions for analysing geographical, technical, economic and, finally,
feasible onshore wind potentials. We address each of these potentials in turn,
including aspects related to land eligibility criteria, energy meteorology, and
technical developments relating to wind turbine characteristics such as power
density, specific rotor power and spacing aspects. Economic aspects of
potential assessments are central to future deployment and are discussed on a
turbine and system level covering levelized costs depending on locations, and
the system integration costs which are often overlooked in such analyses.
Non-technical approaches include scenicness assessments of the landscape,
expert and stakeholder workshops, willingness to pay / accept elicitations and
socioeconomic cost-benefit studies. For each of these different potential
estimations, the state of the art is critically discussed, with an attempt to
derive best practice recommendations and highlight avenues for future research.

Our application domain is ocean system modeling, where test oracles rarely

This paper presents work in progress for the automated generation of
metamorphic test scenarios using machine learning. We extended our previously
proposed method [1] to identify metamorphic relations with reduced
computational complexity. Initially, we represent metamorphic relations as
identity maps. We construct a cost function that minimizes for identifying a
metamorphic relation orthogonal to previously found metamorphic relations and
penalize for the identity map. A machine learning algorithm is used to identify
all possible metamorphic relations minimizing the defined cost function. We
propose applying dimensionality reduction techniques to identify attributes in
the input which have high variance among the identified metamorphic relations.
We apply mutation on these selected attributes to identify distinct metamorphic
relations with reduced computational complexity. For experimental evaluation,
we subject the two implementations of an ocean-modeling application to the
proposed method to present the use of metamorphic relations to test the two
implementations of this application.

is a growing need to build large and complex AI-based systems in a

Debt (TD) will emerge naturally over time in these systems, therefore leading
to challenges and risks if not managed appropriately. The influence of data
science and the stochastic nature of AI-based systems may also lead to new
types of TD or antipatterns, which are not yet fully understood by researchers
and practitioners. Objective: The goal of our study is to provide a clear
overview and characterization of the types of TD (both established and new
ones) that appear in AI-based systems, as well as the antipatterns and related
solutions that have been proposed. Method: Following the process of a
systematic mapping study, 21 primary studies are identified and analyzed.
Results: Our results show that (i) established TD types, variations of them,
and four new TD types (data, model, configuration, and ethics debt) are present
in AI-based systems, (ii) 72 antipatterns are discussed in the literature, the
majority related to data and model deficiencies, and (iii) 46 solutions have
been proposed, either to address specific TD types, antipatterns, or TD in
general. Conclusions: Our results can support AI professionals with reasoning
about and communicating aspects of TD present in their systems. Additionally,
they can serve as a foundation for future research to further our understanding
of TD in AI-based systems.

Hierarchical metamaterials utilize structure at multiple size scales to realize
new and highly desirable properties which can be strikingly different from
those of the constituent materials. In mechanical resonators whose rigidity is
provided by static tension, structural hierarchy can reduce the dissipation of
the fundamental mode to ultralow levels due to an unconventional form of soft
clamping. Here, we apply hierarchical design to silicon nitride nanomechanical
resonators and realize binary tree-shaped resonators with quality factors as
high as $10^9$ at 107 kHz frequency, reaching the parameter regime of levitated
particles. The resonators' thermal-noise-limited force sensitivities reach
$740\ \mathrm{zN/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at room temperature and $\mathrm{90\
zN/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 6 K, surpassing state-of-the-art cantilevers currently used
for force microscopy. We also find that the self-similar structure of binary
tree resonators results in fractional spectral dimensions, which is
characteristic of fractal geometries. Moreover, we show that the hierarchical
design principles can be extended to 2D trampoline membranes, and we fabricate
ultralow dissipation membranes suitable for interferometric position
measurements in Fabry-P\'erot cavities. Hierarchical nanomechanical resonators
open new avenues in force sensing, signal transduction and quantum

planet, but labels (e.g., buildings, facilities, roads) are often available
only for a single point in time. We propose a general model, Temporal Cluster
Matching (TCM), for detecting building changes in time series of remotely
sensed imagery when footprint labels are observed only once. The intuition
behind the model is that the relationship between spectral values inside and
outside of building's footprint will change when a building is constructed (or
demolished). For instance, in rural settings, the pre-construction area may
look similar to the surrounding environment until the building is constructed.
Similarly, in urban settings, the pre-construction areas will look different
from the surrounding environment until construction. We further propose a
heuristic method for selecting the parameters of our model which allows it to
be applied in novel settings without requiring data labeling efforts (to fit
the parameters). We apply our model over a dataset of poultry barns from
2016/2017 high-resolution aerial imagery in the Delmarva Peninsula and a
dataset of solar farms from a 2020 mosaic of Sentinel 2 imagery in India. Our
results show that our model performs as well when fit using the proposed
heuristic as it does when fit with labeled data, and further, that supervised
versions of our model perform the best among all the baselines we test against.
Finally, we show that our proposed approach can act as an effective data
augmentation strategy -- it enables researchers to augment existing structure
footprint labels along the time dimension and thus use imagery from multiple
points in time to train deep learning models. We show that this improves the
spatial generalization of such models when evaluated on the same change
detection task.

superposition of twisted helical spin-density waves formed by different
sublattices of the crystal. Such twisted spin-density waves propagate in the
same direction but with different phases and different directions of the
rotation axes. We derive an advanced micromagnetic expression describing the
exchange and DM interaction for such magnetic structures. By employing
first-principles calculations based on density functional theory and using our
micromagnetic model we show that the magnitude of the spin-spiral twist in B20
FeGe is of the same order as global spiraling. While the energy difference
between the ground state of twisted spirals and the FM state is in good
agreement with the experimental results, for the spin spirals without a twist
it is smaller by factor three. In addition, we verify our results by employing
spin dynamics simulations. This calls for new experiments exploring the ground
state properties of B20 chiral magnets.

the servers are storage constrained in that they can only store a fraction
$\mu=t/N$ of each file. Furthermore, we assume that the files are stored in an
uncoded fashion. The rate of a PIR protocol is defined as the ratio of the file
size and the total number of bits downloaded. The maximum achievable rate is
referred to as capacity. It was previously shown that there are capacity
achieving PIR protocols when the file size is $N^F$ and complete files were
stored on all the servers. These results were further extended for the case
when servers store only a fraction of each file. However, the subpacketization
$v$ of the files required is exponential in the number of servers $N$. We
propose a novel uncoded PIR protocol based on combinatorial designs that are
also capacity achieving when the file size is $v \times t^F$. Our protocol has
linear subpacketization in the number of servers in contrast to previous work
in storage constrained uncoded PIR schemes. In the proposed PIR protocol, the
given system is projected to multiple instances of reduced systems with
replicated servers having full storage capacity. The subfiles stored in these
various instances are separately retrieved and lifted to solve the PIR problem
for the original system.

solids are not fully understood. For example, the perovskite (PV) SrCoO3 is a
FM metal while the oxygen-deficient (n-doped) brownmillerite (BM) SrCoO2.5 is
an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) insulator. Given the magnetic and structural
transitions that accompany the MIT, the driver for such a MIT transition is
unclear. We also observe that the perovskite metals LaNiO3, SrFeO3, and SrCoO3
also undergo MIT when n-doped via high-to-low valence compositional changes.
Also, pressurizing the insulating BM SrCoO2.5 phase, drives a gap closing.
Using DFT and correlated diffusion Monte Carlo approaches we demonstrate that
the ABO3 perovskites most prone to MIT are self hole-doped materials,
reminiscent of a negative charge-transfer system. Upon n-doping away from the
negative-charge transfer metallic phase, an underlying charge-lattice (or
e-phonon) coupling drives the system to a bond-disproportionated gapped state,
thereby achieving ligand hole passivation at certain sites only, leading to
charge-disproportionated states. The size of the gap opened is correlated with
the size of the hole-filling at these ligand sites. This suggests that the
interactions driving the gap opening to realize a MIT even in correlated metals
is the charge-transfer energy, but it couples with the underlying phonons to
enable the transition to the insulating phase. Other orderings (magnetic,
charge, etc.) driven by weaker interactions are secondary and may assist gap
openings at small dopings, but its the charge-transfer energy that
predominantly determines the bandgap, with a negative energy preferring the
metallic phase. This n-doping can be achieved by modulations in stoichiometry
or composition or pressure. Hence, controlling the amount of the ligand-hole is
key in controlling MIT. We compare our predictions to experiments where
possible.

assumptions allow to produce generative models and to conduct an explicit
analysis of the loss function commonly used by these NLP techniques. Moreover,
we produce synthetic corpora with different levels of structure and show
empirically how the word2vec algorithm succeed, or not, to learn them. It leads
us to empirically assess the capability of such models to capture structures on
a corpus of around 42 millions of financial News covering 12 years. That for,
we rely on the Loughran-McDonald Sentiment Word Lists largely used on financial

reducible $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, we show that the number of integers $d$, $|d|

allows us to count integers satisfying certain congruences while also being
divisible only by certain primes.

number of pairs of elements with least common multiple at most $x$ is
$O(x^{1-\epsilon})$ for some $\epsilon > 0$. We also exhibit a matching lower
bound.

prove all the aforementioned results and that the coefficient $c$ above is
greater in the real quadratic case than in the imaginary quadratic case, in

first-year Dark Energy Survey data (DES Y1), making use of a Hybrid Effective
Field Theory (HEFT) approach to model the galaxy-matter relation on weakly
non-linear scales, initially proposed in Modi et al. (2020) (arXiv:1910.07097).
This allows us to explore the enhancement in cosmological constraining power
enabled by extending the galaxy clustering scale range typically used in
projected large-scale structure analyses. Our analysis is based on a recomputed
harmonic-space data vector and covariance matrix, carefully accounting for all
sources of mode-coupling, non-Gaussianity and shot noise, which allows us to
provide robust goodness-of-fit measures. We use the \textsc{AbacusSummit} suite
of simulations to build an emulator for the HEFT model predictions. We find
that this model can explain the galaxy clustering and shear data up to
wavenumbers $k_{\rm max}\sim 0.6\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We constrain
$(S_8,\Omega_m) = (0.786\pm 0.020,0.273^{+0.030}_{-0.036})$ at the fiducial
$k_{\rm max}\sim 0.3\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, improving to $(S_8,\Omega_m) =
(0.786^{+0.015}_{-0.018},0.266^{+0.024}_{-0.027})$ at $k_{\rm max}\sim 0.5\,
{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. This represents a $\sim10\%$ and $\sim35\%$ improvement on the
constraints derived respectively on both parameters using a linear bias
relation on a reduced scale range ($k_{\rm max}\lesssim0.15\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$),
in spite of the 15 additional parameters involved in the HEFT model. We
investigate whether HEFT can be used to constrain the Hubble parameter and find
$H_0= 70.7_{-3.5}^{+3.0}\,{\rm km}\,s^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our constraints
are investigative and subject to certain caveats discussed in the text.

exploring the vast uncharted parameter space that will soon be constrained by
measurements of the 21 cm power spectrum. One of these parameters, $R_{\rm
max}$, is meant to characterize the absorption of photons by residual neutral
gas inside of ionized regions, but has historically been implemented in a very
simplistic fashion acting only as a maximum filtering scale. We leverage the
correspondence between excursion set methods and the integrated flux from
ionizing sources to define two physically-motivated prescriptions of the mean
free path of ionizing photons that smoothly attenuate the contribution from
distant sources. Implementation of these methods in semi-numerical reionization
codes requires only modest additional computational effort due to the fact that
spatial filtering is still performed on scales larger than the characteristic
absorption distance. We find that our smoothly-defined mean free path
prescriptions more effectively suppress large-scale structures in the
ionization field in semi-numerical reionization simulations compared to the
standard $R_{\rm max}$ approach, and the magnitude of the mean free path
modulates the power spectrum in a much smoother manner. We show that this
suppression of large-scale power is significant enough to be relevant for
upcoming 21 cm power spectrum observations. Finally, we show that in our model
the mean free path plays a larger role in regulating the reionization history
than in models using $R_{\rm max}$.

Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen. The emphasis of the analysis is on systematic
uncertainties related to propagation and nuclear cross sections. To investigate
the uncertainties in the propagation scenario, we consider five different
frameworks, differing with respect to the inclusion of a diffusion break at a
few GV, the presence of reacceleration, and the presence of a break in the
injection spectra of primaries. For each framework we fit the diffusion
equations of cosmic rays and explore the parameter space with Monte Carlo
methods. At the same time, the impact of the uncertainties in the nuclear
production cross sections of secondaries is explicitly considered and included
in the fit through the use of nuisance parameters. We find that all the
considered frameworks are able to provide a good fit. In particular, two
competing scenarios, one including a break in diffusion but no reacceleration
and the other with reacceleration but no break in diffusion are both allowed.
The inclusion of cross-section uncertainties is, however, crucial, to this
result. Thus, at the moment, these uncertainties represent a fundamental
systematic preventing a deeper understanding of the properties of CR
propagation. We find, nonetheless, that the slope of diffusion at intermediate
rigidities is robustly constrained in the range $\delta\simeq0.45-0.5$ in
models without convection, or $\delta\simeq0.4-0.5$ if convection is included
in the fit. Furthermore, we find that the use of the AMS-02 Beryllium data
provides a lower limit on the vertical size of the Galactic propagation halo of
$z_\mathrm{h}\gtrsim3$ kpc.

generally match both the median surface density profile as well as the scatter
in stellar halo surface density profiles seen in observed stellar halos. We
conclude that there is no ``missing outskirts'' problem in cosmological

characteristic mass ($m_{ch}$). We show that accounting for the incomplete

the observed stars, we can obtain even tighter constrains on $m_{min}$. By
exploiting the 96 stars with measured metallicities ($\rm i < 19$) in the UFDs
represented by our model, we demonstrate that: $m_{ch} > 1 \rm M_{\odot}$ or
$m_{min} > 0.8 \rm M_{\odot}$ at $99\%$ confidence level. This means that a
present day IMF for PopIII stars is excluded by our model, and a top-heavy

implication on the role of quasars in reionizing the intergalactic medium at
early times has been an outstanding problem for some time. The identification
of faint high-redshift quasars with luminosities of <1e44.5 erg/s is
challenging. They are rare (few per square-degree) and the separation of these
unresolved quasars from late-type stars and compact star-forming galaxies is
difficult from ground-based observations alone. In addition, source confusion
becomes significant at >25mag, with 30% of sources having their flux
contaminated by foreground objects when the seeing resolution is ~0.7"". We
mitigate these issues by performing a pixel-level joint processing of ground
and space-based data from Subaru/HSC and HST/ACS. We create a deconfused
catalog over the 1.64 square-degrees of the COSMOS field, after accounting for
spatial varying PSFs and astrometric differences between the two datasets. We
identify twelve low-luminosity (M_UV ~ -21 mag) z>6 quasar candidates through
(i) their red color measured between ACS/F814W and HSC/i-band and (ii) their
compactness in the space-based data. Non-detections of our candidates in Hubble
DASH data argues against contamination from late-type stars. Our constraints on
the faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z~6.4 suggests a negligibly
small contribution to reionization compared to the star-forming galaxy
population. The confirmation of our candidates and the evolution of number
density with redshift could provide better insights into how supermassive
galaxies grew in the first billion years of cosmic time.

the IMF-averaged nucleosynthetic yields of a stellar population. Building on
the work of Sukhbold et al. (2016), we compute IMF-averaged yields at solar
metallicity for a wide range of assumptions, including neutrino-driven engine
models with extensive BH formation, models with a simple mass threshold for BH
formation, and a model in which all stars from $8-120 \text{M}_{\odot}$
explode. For plausible choices, the overall yields of $\alpha$-elements span a
factor of three, but changes in relative yields are more subtle, typically
$0.05-0.2$ dex. For constraining the overall level of BH formation, ratios of C
and N to O or Mg are promising diagnostics. For distinguishing complex,
theoretically motivated landscapes from simple mass thresholds, abundance
ratios involving Mn or Ni are promising because of their sensitivity to the
core structure of the CCSN progenitors. We confirm previous findings of a
substantial (factor $2.5-4$) discrepancy between predicted O/Mg yield ratios
and observationally inferred values, implying that models either overproduce O
or underproduce Mg. No landscape choice achieves across-the-board agreement
with observed abundance ratios; the discrepancies offer empirical clues to
aspects of massive star evolution or explosion physics still missing from the

Limongi & Chieffi (2018). We provide tables of IMF-integrated yields for
several landscape scenarios, and more flexible user-designed models can be
implemented through the publicly available $\texttt{Versatile Integrator for

formation, but to accurately compare observations to models of stellar
evolution, the age of an association must be determined. The Upper Scorpius
region is the youngest section of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, which
is the largest collection of nearby, young, low-mass stars. The true age of
Upper Scorpius is not clear, and an observed mass-dependent age gradient in
Upper Scorpius, as well as in other star-forming regions, complicates age
measurements. The age gradient may indicate a genuine astrophysical feature or
may be an artifact of unrecognized systematic effects in stellar age
measurements. We have conducted a synthetic red-optical low-resolution
spectroscopic survey of a simulated analog to the Upper Scorpius star-forming
region to investigate the effects of unresolved binary stars (which have
mass-dependent demographics) on age measurements of a stellar population. We
find that the observed mass-dependent age gradient in Upper Scorpius can be
explained by a population of undetected binary stars. For a simulated
population with an age of 10 (RMS = 2) Myr, we measure an age of 10.5 (RMS =
3.5) Myr for F stars, and 7.5 (RMS = 5.8) Myr for M stars. This discrepancy is
caused by the mass-dependent mass ratio distribution and the variable steepness
of the mass-luminosity relation. Our results support the previously suggested
10 Myr age for Upper Scorpius, with a small intrinsic age spread.

band fillings that ordinarily correspond to insulators or compensated
accidental semimetals with zero Luttinger volume. Their metallicity is a result
of nontrivial topology in momentum space and crystal symmetry, wherein
topological charges may be assigned to point band-touching nodes, preventing
gap opening, unless protecting crystal symmetries are violated. These
topological charges, however, are defined from noninteracting band eigenstates,
which raises the possibility that the physics of topological semimetals may be
modified qualitatively by electron-electron interactions. Here we ask the
following question: what makes the topological semimetals nontrivial beyond
band theory? Alternatively, can strong electron-electron interactions open a
gap in topological semimetals without breaking the protecting symmetries or
introducing topological order? We demonstrate that the answer is generally no,
and what prevents it is their topological response, or quantum anomalies. While
this is familiar in the case of magnetic Weyl semimetals, where the topological
response takes the form of an anomalous Hall effect, analogous responses in
other types of topological semimetals are more subtle and involve crystal
symmetry as well as electromagnetic gauge fields. Physically these responses
are detectable as fractional symmetry charges induced on certain gauge defects.
We discuss the cases of type-I Dirac semimetals and time-reversal invariant
Weyl semimetals in detail. For type-I Dirac semimetals, we also show that the
anomaly vanishes, in a nontrivial manner, if the momenta of the Dirac nodes
satisfy certain exceptional conditions.

However, the financial burden associated with smart city projects is a
detriment to prospective smart cities. A noteworthy factor that impacts the
cost and sustainability of smart city projects is providing cellular Internet
connectivity to IoT devices. In response to this problem, this paper explores
the use of public transportation network nodes and mules, such as bus-stops as
buses, to facilitate connectivity via device-to-device communication in order
to reduce cellular connectivity costs within a smart city. The data mules
convey non-urgent data from IoT devices to edge computing hardware, where data
can be processed or sent to the cloud. Consequently, this paper focuses on edge
node placement in smart cities that opportunistically leverage public transit
networks for reducing reliance on and thus costs of cellular connectivity. We
introduce an algorithm that selects a set of edge nodes that provides maximal
sensor coverage and explore another that selects a set of edge nodes that
provide minimal delivery delay within a budget. The algorithms are evaluated
for two public transit network data-sets:Chapel Hill, North Carolina and
Louisville, Kentucky. Results show that our algorithms consistently outperform
edge node placement strategies that rely on traditional centrality
metrics(betweenness and in-degree centrality) by over 77% reduction in coverage

functionalities for robots to safely interact with humans as well as
environments. Although both object recognition and pose estimation use visual
input, most state-of-the-art tackles them as two separate problems since the
former needs a view-invariant representation while object pose estimation
necessitates a view-dependent description. Nowadays, multi-view Convolutional
Neural Network (MVCNN) approaches show state-of-the-art classification
performance. Although MVCNN object recognition has been widely explored, there
has been very little research on multi-view object pose estimation methods, and
even less on addressing these two problems simultaneously. The pose of virtual
cameras in MVCNN methods is often predefined in advance, leading to bound the
application of such approaches. In this paper, we propose an approach capable
of handling object recognition and pose estimation simultaneously. In
particular, we develop a deep object-agnostic entropy estimation model, capable
of predicting the best viewpoints of a given 3D object. The obtained views of
the object are then fed to the network to simultaneously predict the pose and
category label of the target object. Experimental results showed that the views
obtained from such positions are descriptive enough to achieve a good accuracy
score. Furthermore, we designed a real-life serve drink scenario to demonstrate
how well the proposed approach worked in real robot tasks. Code is available

M2 dwarf, was found to harbor a giant hydrogen exosphere thanks to 3 transits
observed with the HST/STIS. Here we report on 3 additional transit observations
from the PanCET program, obtained with the HST/COS. These data confirm the
absorption signature from GJ3470b's exosphere in the stellar Ly-alpha line and
demonstrate its stability over time. No planetary signatures are detected in
other lines, setting a 3sigma limit on GJ3470b's FUV radius at 1.3x its Roche
lobe radius. We detect 3 flares from GJ3470. They show different spectral
energy distributions but peak consistently in the Si III line, which traces
intermediate-temperature layers in the transition region. These layers appear
to play a particular role in GJ3470's activity as emission lines that form at
lower or higher temperatures than Si III evolved differently over the long
term. Based on the measured emission lines, we derive synthetic XUV spectra for
the 6 observed quiescent phases, covering one year, as well as for the 3
flaring episodes. Our results suggest that most of GJ3470's quiescent
high-energy emission comes from the EUV domain, with flares amplifying the FUV
emission more strongly. The hydrogen photoionization lifetimes and mass loss
derived for GJ3470b show little variation over the epochs, in agreement with
the stability of the exosphere. Simulations informed by our XUV spectra are

  Predictive Control","To be updated",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This thesis is concerned with the rejection of time-varying disturbances in
linear model predictive control of discrete-time systems. In the literature,
disturbances are widely rejected by using velocity models, disturbance model
with observer approach or a scheme that combines the compensation of a
disturbance observer and the feedback regulation of MPC. Contrary to the widely
used methods, the technique proposed in this research utilises the increment
model of plants, with the assumption of fast-changing disturbances, to
formulate a control law to reject the varying-disturbances. The uniqueness of
the method stems from the compensation of the disturbance magnitude and rate of
change. By proposing a cost function where the increment form of the system
disturbance is taken as an optimisation variable, a control signal that is a
function of a computed optimal disturbance increment is formulated to ensure
that the plant is driven according to the minimisation of the cost function.
The degree of freedom introduced by using the optimal disturbance in the
control law was exploited to introduce the estimated disturbance increment into
the control signal such that it is always in opposition to the external
disturbance increment. Moreover, the proposed cost function provides a
weighting matrix that can be used to manipulate the impacts of the exogenous
disturbances on the response of the system. To estimate the unmeasurable
disturbances, a combined state and disturbance observer is designed based on a
convex optimisation stated in terms of an H2-minimisation problem. Simulations
of three different systems are used to show the benefits of the proposed
algorithm when compared with conventional offset-free MPC techniques. The
results demonstrated that the proposed scheme can give significantly improved
output tracking and regulation.

visualized via the dynamic broadening of the heavy-hole and light-hole exciton
resonances caused by the exciton-exciton scattering. Under the non-resonant
excitation free carriers are optically generated. In this regime the exciton
dynamics is strongly affected by the exciton-carrier scattering. In particular,
if the carriers of one sign are prevailing, they efficiently deplete the
reservoir of the nonradiative excitons inducing their scattering into the light

energy relaxation of photocreated electrons and holes, their coupling into
excitons, and exciton scattering into the light cone. The model well reproduces
the exciton dynamics observed experimentally both at the resonant and

fractional change in spin frequency of $270.52(3) \times 10^{-9}$. We measured
no significant change in spin-down rate and found no evidence for
rapidly-decaying glitch components. We systematically investigated whether the
glitch affected any radiative parameters of the pulsar and found that its
spectral index, spectral shape, polarisation fractions, and rotation measure
stayed constant within the uncertainties across the glitch epoch. However, its
pulse-averaged flux density increased significantly by about 10 per cent in the
post-glitch epoch and decayed slightly before our fourth observation a day
later. We show that the increase was unlikely caused by calibration issues.
While we cannot exclude that it was due to refractive interstellar
scintillation, it is hard to reconcile with refractive effects. The chance
coincidence probability of the flux density increase and the glitch event is
low. Finally, we present the evolution of the pulsar's pulse profile across the
band. The morphology of its polarimetric pulse profile stayed unaffected to a
precision of better than 2 per cent.

of the most promising tools to test gravity in the strong-field,
large-curvature regime, but without the knowledge of the black hole
quasi-normal modes in specific cases of modified gravity theories, only null
tests of general relativity are possible. More specifically, we need to know
the modes of rotating black holes, because typical compact binary mergers lead
to black holes with large spins. In this article we compute, for the first
time, the gravitational quasi-normal modes of rotating black holes in a
modified gravity theory, up to first order in the spin. We consider
Einstein-dilaton Gauss-Bonnet gravity, one of the simplest modifications of
general relativity in the large-curvature regime. We find that the shifts in
the mode frequencies and damping times due to general relativity modifications
are significantly magnified by rotation.

and only providing relative measurements of expression levels up to an unknown
individual scaling factor. This difficulty is enhanced for differential
expression analysis. Several methods have been proposed to circumvent this lack
of knowledge by estimating the unknown individual scaling factors however, even
the most used one, are suffering from being built on hardly justifiable
biological hypotheses or from having weak statistical background. Only two
methods withstand this analysis: one based on largest connected graph component
hardly usable for large amount of expressions like in NGS, the second based on

the methods described before.
  We introduce a new procedure for differential analysis in the context of

analyses each based on randomly picked genes used as reference genes. It
provides a differential analysis free from the estimation of the individual
scaling factors or any other knowledge. Theoretical properties are investigated
both in term of FWER and power. Moreover in the context of Poisson or negative

non asymptotic control of its bounds. We complete our study by some empirical

perturbation analysis that computes the physical conditions of gravitational
instability, as determined by the balance of self-gravity of the ring against
pressure and Coriolis forces. We adopt our formalism to simulations of CRGs and
show that the analysis can accurately characterise the stability and onset of
fragmentation, although the linear theory appears to under-predict the number
of fragments of an unstable CRG by a factor of 2. In addition, since the
orthodox `density-wave' model is inapplicable to such self-gravitating rings,
we devise a simple approach that describes the rings propagating as material
waves. We find that the toy model can predict whether the simulated CRGs
fragment or not using information from their pre-collision states. We also
apply our instability analysis to a CRG discovered at a high redshift,
$z=2.19$. We find that a quite high velocity dispersion is required for the
stability of the ring, and therefore the CRG should be unstable to ring
fragmentation. CRGs are rarely observed at high redshifts, and this may be
because CRGs are usually too faint. Since the fragmentation can induce active
star formation and make the ring bright enough to observe, the instability
could explain this rarity. An unstable CRG fragments into massive clumps
retaining the initial disc rotation, and thus it would evolve into a clumpy
galaxy with a low surface density in an inter-clump region.

non-monotonic features (or humps and dips) in the Hall signal and is widely
interpreted as a sign of chiral spin textures, like magnetic skyrmions.
However, when anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is also present, the co-existence of
two AHEs could give rise to similar artifacts, making it difficult to
distinguish between genuine THE with AHE and two-component AHE. Here we confirm
genuine THE with AHE by means of transport and magneto-optical Kerr effect
(MOKE) microscopy, in which magnetic skyrmions are directly observed, and find
that genuine THE occurs in the transition region of the AHE. In sharp contrast,
the artifact ""THE"", or two-component AHE occurs well beyond the saturation of
the ""AHE component"" (under the false assumption of THE+AHE). Furthermore, we
distinguish artifact ""THE"" from genuine THE by three methods: 1. Minor loops,
2. Temperature dependence, 3. Gate dependence. Minor loops of genuine THE with
AHE are always within the full loop, while minor loops of the artifact ""THE""
may reveal a single loop that cannot fit into the ""AHE component"". Besides, the
temperature or gate dependence of the artifact ""THE"" may also be accompanied by
a polarity change of the ""AHE component"", as the non-monotonic features vanish,

change. Our work may help future researchers to exercise cautions and use these

we overcome the main challenges of integrating permutation inversions into an

This was heretofore sidestepped by casting the reordering task as
classification, fundamentally reducing the space of permutations that can be
exploited. Our experiments validate that learning from all possible
permutations improves the quality of the pre-trained representations over using
a limited, fixed set. Second, we show that inverting permutations is a
meaningful pretext task for learning audio representations in an unsupervised
fashion. In particular, we improve instrument classification and pitch

us to reduce the covariances of astrometric residuals for nearby sources by
about one order of magnitude, from 30 mas$^2$ to 3 mas$^2$ at angular scales of

process interpolation are similar to recent result published with the Dark

examines the \textit{neighbouring time} of tracer trajectories, defined as the
total flow time two Voronoi cells share a common Voronoi edge, by converting
this information into a Cartesian distance in the graph representation of the
Voronoi diagram. Coherence is assigned to groups of Voronoi cells whose
neighbouring time remains high throughout the time interval of analysis. The
technique is first tested on the two-dimensional synthetic data of a

oscillation. This paper reports the KM3NeT/ORCA sensitivity to this phenomenon.
The event reconstruction, selection and classification are described. The
sensitivity to determine the neutrino mass ordering was evaluated and found to
be 4.4 $\sigma$ if the true ordering is normal and 2.3 $\sigma$ if inverted,
after three years of data taking. The precision to measure $\Delta m^2_{32}$
and $\theta_{23}$ were also estimated and found to be $85\cdot10^{-6}$ eV$^2$
and $(^{+1.9}_{-3.1})^{\circ}$ for normal neutrino mass ordering and,
$75\cdot10^{-6}$ eV$^2$ and $(^{+2.0}_{-7.0})^{\circ}$ for inverted ordering.
Finally, a unitarity test of the leptonic mixing matrix by measuring the rate
of tau neutrinos is described. Three years of data taking were found to be
sufficient to exclude $\nu_{\tau}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ event rate variations
larger than 20% at $3\sigma$ level.

increment their ionic conductivity (IC). A detailed understanding of how the
interactions between the constituent materials are responsible for the
enhancement, remains to be developed. A significant contribution is ascribed to
an increment of the polymer amorphous fraction, induced by the fillers,
resulting in the formation of higher ionic conductivity channels in the polymer
matrix. However, the dependence of IC on the particle weight load and its
composition on the polymer morphology is not fully understood. This work
investigates Li ion transport in composite polymer electrolytes (CPE)
comprising Bi-doped LLZO particles embedded in PEO: LiTFSI matrixes. We find
that the IC optimizes for very low particle weight loads (5 to 10%) and that
both its magnitude and the load required, strongly depend on the garnet
particle composition. Based on structural characterization results and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, a mechanism is proposed to explain
these findings. It is suggested that the Li-molar content in the garnet
particle controls its interactions with the polymer matrix, resulting at the
optimum loads reported, in the formation of high ionic conductivity channels.
We propose that filler particle chemical manipulation of the polymer morphology
is a promising avenue for the further development of composite polymer
electrolytes.

the random rotations scheme at the IRS in which the reflecting elements only
employ random phase rotations without requiring any CSI. The only CSI then
needed is at the base station (BS) of the overall channel to implement the
beamforming transmission scheme. Under this framework, we derive the sum-rate

increases the sum-rate by exploiting multi-user diversity, but also compromises
the gain to some extent due to correlation. Finally, energy efficiency
maximization problems in terms of the number of BS antennas, IRS elements and

particularly relevant for transient and transitional flow problems, as well as

representative problems of practical interest. The results illustrate that it
is possible to conduct reliable verification and validation exercises with SRS

Most notably, the data also confirm the advantages and potential of the

worst-case complexity analysis of IEA yields a factor of $\nu!$, $\nu>n$, large
sets of the permutations of the critical jobs can be discarded by incorporating
a heuristic search strategy, in which the permutations of the so-called

in practice, the number $\nu$ turns out to be several times smaller than the

not have modules to learn the semantic representation from speech encoder.
Moreover, the higher frame-rate of speech representation prevents the model to
learn the semantic representation properly. Therefore, the models that are
constructed by the lower frame-rate of speech encoder lead to better
performance. For Transformer-based ASR, the lower frame-rate is not only
important for learning better semantic representation but also for reducing the
computational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism which has O(n^2)
order of complexity in both training and inference. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-based ASR model with the time reduction layer, in which we
incorporate time reduction layer inside transformer encoder layers in addition
to traditional sub-sampling methods to input features that further reduce the
frame-rate. This can help in reducing the computational cost of the
self-attention process for training and inference with performance improvement.
Moreover, we introduce a fine-tuning approach for pre-trained ASR models using
self-knowledge distillation (S-KD) which further improves the performance of
our ASR model. Experiments on LibriSpeech datasets show that our proposed
methods outperform all other Transformer-based ASR systems. Furthermore, with

transactions, cause contention in a concurrency control protocol. While a
hotspot may comprise only a small fraction of a transaction's execution time,
conventional strict two-phase locking allows a transaction to release lock only
after the transaction completes, which leaves significant parallelism
unexploited. Ideally, a concurrency control protocol serializes transactions
only for the duration of the hotspots, rather than the duration of
transactions. We observe that exploiting such parallelism requires violating
two-phase locking. In this paper, we propose Bamboo, a new concurrency control
protocol that can enable such parallelism by modifying the conventional
two-phase locking, while maintaining the same guarantees in correctness. We
thoroughly analyzed the effect of cascading aborts involved in reading
uncommitted data and discussed optimizations that can be applied to further
improve the performance. Our evaluation on TPC-C shows a performance
improvement up to 4x compared to the best of pessimistic and optimistic

that can be exploited to infer properties about cosmic rays and neutrino
oscillations. The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment,
a 20 kton liquid scintillator detector with excellent energy resolution is
currently under construction in China. JUNO will be able to detect several
atmospheric neutrinos per day given the large volume. A study on the JUNO
detection and reconstruction capabilities of atmospheric $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$
fluxes is presented in this paper. In this study, a sample of atmospheric
neutrino Monte Carlo events has been generated, starting from theoretical
models, and then processed by the detector simulation. The excellent timing
resolution of the 3'' PMT light detection system of JUNO detector and the much
higher light yield for scintillation over Cherenkov allow to measure the time
structure of the scintillation light with very high precision. Since $\nu_e$
and $\nu_\mu$ interactions produce a slightly different light pattern, the
different time evolution of light allows to discriminate the flavor of primary
neutrinos. A probabilistic unfolding method has been used, in order to infer
the primary neutrino energy spectrum from the detector experimental
observables. The simulated spectrum has been reconstructed between 100 MeV and
10 GeV, showing a great potential of the detector in the atmospheric low energy
region.

equilibrium state of matter through the constrained maximization of a special
functional, entropy. Its elegance and enormous success have led to numerous
attempts to decipher its language and make it available to problems outside
physics, but a formal generalization has remained elusive. Here we show how the
formalism of thermodynamics can be applied to any stochastic process. We view a
stochastic process as a random walk on the event space of a random variable
that produces a feasible distribution of states. The set of feasible
distributions obeys thermodynamics: the most probable distribution is the
canonical distribution, it maximizes the functionals of statistical mechanics,
and its parameters satisfy the same Legendre relationships. Thus the formalism
of thermodynamics -- no new functionals beyond those already encountered in
statistical physics -- is shown to be a stochastic calculus, a universal
language of probability distributions and stochastic processes.

element for the numerical exploration of the dynamics of compact-object
binaries. While several codes have been developed over the years to compute
generic quasi-equilibrium configurations of binaries comprising either two
black holes, or two neutron stars, or a black hole and a neutron star, these
codes are often not publicly available or they provide only a limited
capability in terms of mass ratios and spins of the components in the binary.
We here present a new open-source collection of spectral elliptic solvers that
are capable of exploring the major parameter space of binary black holes
(BBHs), binary neutron stars (BNSs), and mixed binaries of black holes and
neutron stars (BHNSs). Particularly important is the ability of the
spectral-solver library to handle neutron stars that are either irrotational or
with an intrinsic spin angular momentum that is parallel to the orbital one. By
supporting both analytic and tabulated equations of state at zero or finite
temperature, the new infrastructure is particularly geared towards allowing for
the construction of BHNS and BNS binaries. For the latter, we show that the new
solvers are able to reach the most extreme corners in the physically plausible
space of parameters, including extreme mass ratios and spin asymmetries, thus
representing the most extreme BNS computed to date. Through a systematic series
of examples, we demonstrate that the solvers are able to construct
quasi-equilibrium and eccentricity-reduced initial data for BBHs, BNSs, and
BHNSs, achieving spectral convergence in all cases. Furthermore, using such
initial data, we have carried out evolutions of these systems from the inspiral
to after the merger, obtaining evolutions with eccentricities $\lesssim
10^{-4}-10^{-3}$, and accurate gravitational waveforms.

the quantum interference between these two optical excitation pathways by using
phase-shaped femtosecond laser pulses. We find enhancements by a factor of up
to 1.75 in the two-photon-excited fluorescence of the photobase FR0-SB in
methanol after taking into account the longer pulse duration of the shaped
laser pulses. Simulations taking into account the different responses of the
virtual and dipole pathways to external fields and the effect of pulse shaping
on two-photon transitions are found to be in good agreement with our
experimental measurements. The observed quantum control of TPE in condensed

microscopy, multiphoton-excited photoreagents, and novel spectroscopic
techniques that are sensitive to the magnitude of the contributions from the
virtual and dipole pathways to multiphoton excitations.

opening a new arena to confront general relativity (and modifications thereof)

introducing a scalar field coupled to a parity-violating curvature term known
as dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. In this theory, spinning black holes are
different from their general relativistic counterparts and can thus serve as
probes to this theory. We study linear gravito-scalar perturbations of black
holes in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity at leading-order in spin and (i) obtain
the perturbed field equations describing the evolution of the perturbed
gravitational and scalar fields, (ii) numerically solve these equations by
direct integration to calculate the quasinormal mode frequencies for the

that these rotating black holes are linearly stable, and (iv) present general
fitting functions for different multipoles for gravitational and scalar

parameters and the absolute luminosity can be deduced by analyzing the
characteristic shape of the differential cross-section spectrum. The experiment
is based on fixed target kinematics and uses an internal hydrogen cluster jet
target. The wide range of |t| is achieved by measuring the total kinetic energy
of the recoil protons near 90{\deg} with a recoil detector, which consists of
silicon and germanium single-sided strip sensors. The energy resolution of the
recoil detector is better than 30 keV (FWHM). A forward detector consisting of
two layers of plastic scintillators measures the elastically scattered beam
particles in the forward direction close to the beam axis. It helps suppress
the large background at small recoil angles and improves the identification of
elastic scattering events in the low |t| range. The KOALA setup has been
installed and commissioned at COSY in order to validate the detector by
measuring the proton-proton elastic scattering. The results from this
commissioning are presented here.

representations for $s<1$ with complex matrices under the $p$-norms
$||X||_p=\text{Tr}[(X^\ast X)^{p/2}]^{1/p}$, and similarly defined quasinorm or
antinorm quantities $||X||_s=\text{Tr}[(X^\ast X)^{s/2}]^{1/s}$. Analogous to
the reverse H\""{o}lder and reverse Minkowski for $L^p$ functions, it has
recently been shown that for $A,B\in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})$ such that $|B|$
is invertible, $||AB||_1\geq ||A||_{s}||B||_{s/(s-1)}$ and for $A,B$ positive
semidefinite that $||A+B||_s\geq ||A||_s+||B||_s$. We comment on variational
representations of these inequalities. A third very important inequality is
Hanner's inequality
$||f+g||_p^p+||f-g||_p^p\geq(||f||_p+||g||_p)^p+|||f||_p-||g||_p|^p$ in the
$1\leq p\leq 2$ range, with the inequality reversing for $p\geq 2$. The
analogue inequality has been proven to hold matrices in certain special cases.
No reverse Hanner has established for functions or matrices considering ranges
with $s<1$. We develop a reverse Hanner inequality for functions, and show that
it holds for matrices under special conditions; it is sufficient but not
necessary for $C+D, C-D\geq 0$. We also extend certain related singular value
rearrangement inequalities that were previously known in the $1\leq p\leq3$
range to the $s<1$ range. Finally, we use the same techniques to characterize
the previously unstudied equality case: we show that there is equality when
$p\neq 1,2$ if and only if $|D|=k|C|$, which is directly analogous to the $L^p$
equality condition.

environment where the attacker's source model and the target blackbox model may
have disjoint label spaces and training datasets. This scenario significantly
differs from the ""standard"" blackbox setting, and warrants a unique approach to
the attacking process. Our methodology begins with the construction of a class
correspondence matrix between the whitebox and blackbox label sets. During the
online phase of the attack, we then leverage representations of highly related
proxy classes from the whitebox distribution to fool the blackbox model into
predicting the desired target class. Our attacks are evaluated in three complex
and challenging test environments where the source and target models have
varying degrees of conceptual overlap amongst their unique categories.
Ultimately, we find that it is indeed possible to construct targeted
transfer-based adversarial attacks between models that have non-overlapping
label spaces! We also analyze the sensitivity of attack success to properties
of the clean data. Finally, we show that our transfer attacks serve as powerful
adversarial priors when integrated with query-based methods, markedly boosting
query efficiency and adversarial success.

possible ways. Except for demonstrating nonclassical signature of entangled
states in question, they can also serve for device-independent self-testing of
states, as shown, e.g., in Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 180401 (2012). Here we develop
and broaden these results to an extended version of Hardy's argument, often
referred to as Cabello's nonlocality argument. We show that, as in the simpler
case of Hardy's nonlocality argument, the maximum quantum value for Cabello's
nonlocality is achieved by a pure two-qubit state and projective measurements
that are unique up to local isometries. We also examine the properties of a
more realistic case when small errors in the ideal constraints are accepted
within the probabilities obtained and prove that also in this case the
two-qubit state and measurements are sufficient for obtaining the maximum
quantum violation of the classical bound.

stacks of tokens placed in a circle. A move consists of choosing $k$
consecutive stacks and taking at least one token from one or more of the

Who can win from a given position if both players play optimally? In an
impartial combinatorial game, there are only two types of positions. An
$\mathcal{N}$-position is one from which the next player to move has a winning
strategy. A $\mathcal{P}$-position is one from which the next player is bound
to lose, no matter what moves s/he makes. Therefore, the question who wins is
answered by identifying the $\mathcal{P}$-positions. We will prove results on
the structure of the $\mathcal{P}$-positions for $n = 7$ and $k = 4$, extending
known results for other games in this family. The interesting feature of the

adaptive filtering technique for adaptive optics (AO) systems controlled with
integrators. CLOSE leverages the temporal autocorrelation of modal signals in
the controller telemetry and drives the gains of the integral command law in a
closed servo-loop. This supervisory loop is configured using only a few scalar
parameters, and automatically controls the modal gains to closely match
transfer functions achieving minimum variance control. This optimization is
proven to work throughout the range of noise and seeing conditions relevant to
the AO system. This technique has been designed while preparing the high-order
AO systems for extremely large telescopes, in particular for tackling the
optical gain (OG) phenomenon -- a sensitivity reduction induced by on-sky
residuals -- which is a prominent issue with pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFS).
CLOSE follows upon the linear modal compensation approach to OG, previously
demonstrated to substantially improve AO correction with high order PWFS
systems. Operating on modal gains through multiplicative increments, CLOSE
naturally compensates for the recurring issue of unaccounted sensitivity
factors throughout the AO loop. We present end-to-end simulations of the MICADO
instrument single-conjugate AO to demonstrate the performances and capabilities
of CLOSE. We demonstrate that a single configuration shall provide an efficient
and versatile optimization of the modal integrator while accounting for OG
compensation, and while providing significant robustness to transient effects
impacting the PWFS sensitivity.

which are overlooked by the majority of the commonly used QCVV protocols. As
QCVV protocols are indispensable when it comes to characterizing and evaluating
quantum operations, there is a serious need for a detailed characterization
taking into account such aspects. In this work, we address these shortcomings
by designing a context-aware version of the gate set tomography (GST) protocol.
Our experiment selection approach is based on a polynomial quantification of
the accumulation of errors within the designed circuits. Using simulated QPUs,
we show that this technique enables a characterization with an inaccuracy
reaching $10^{-5}$. Furthermore, we use our proposed protocol to experimentally
infer context-dependent errors, namely crosstalk and memory effects, in a
publicly accessible cloud-based superconducting qubits platform. Our results
show that when the GST is upgraded to include such features of
context-awareness, a large coherence in the errors is observed. These findings
open up possibilities of drastically reducing the errors within the currently
demonstrated QPUs.

search for isolated BHs, which to date have not been detected. Two microlensing
events, MACHO-1996-BLG-5 (M96-B5) and MACHO-1998-BLG-6 (M98-B6), initially
observed near the lens-source minimum angular separation in 1996 and 1998,
respectively, have long Einstein crossing times (>300 days), identifying the
lenses as candidate black holes. Twenty years have elapsed since the time of
lens-source closest approach for each of these events, indicating that if the
lens and source are both luminous, and if their relative proper motion is
sufficiently large, the two components should be spatially resolvable. We
attempt to eliminate the possibility of a stellar lens for these events by: (1)
using Keck near-infrared adaptive optics images to search for a potentially
now-resolved, luminous lens; and (2) examining multi-band photometry of the
source to search for flux contributions from a potentially unresolved, luminous
lens. We combine detection limits from NIRC2 images with light curve data to
eliminate all non-BH lenses for relative lens-source proper motions above 0.81

memory-rate tradeoff for caching with uncoded cache placement, under nonuniform

proposed by Yu, etal., we formulate the cache placement optimization problem
for the MCCS to minimize the average delivery rate under nonuniform file

present two information-theoretic lower bounds on the average rate for caching
with uncoded placement, one for general cache placements and the other
restricted to the popularity-first placements. By comparing the average rate of
the optimized MCCS with the lower bounds, we prove that the optimized MCCS
attains the general lower bound for the two-user case, providing the exact
memory-rate tradeoff. Furthermore, it attains the popularity-first-based lower
bound for the case of general K users with distinct file requests. In these two
cases, our results also reveal that the popularity-first placement is optimal
for the MCCS, and zero-padding used in coded delivery incurs no loss of
optimality. For the case of K users with redundant file requests, our analysis
shows that there may exist a gap between the optimized MCCS and the lower
bounds due to zero-padding. We next fully characterize the optimal
popularity-first cache placement for the MCCS, which is shown to possess a
simple file-grouping structure and can be computed via an efficient algorithm
using closed-form expressions. Finally, we extend our study to accommodate both
nonuniform file popularity and sizes, where we show that the optimized MCCS
attains the lower bound for the two-user case, providing the exact memory-rate
tradeoff. Numerical results show that, for general settings, the gap between
the optimized MCCS and the lower bound only exists in limited cases and is very
small.

tests. Results show that faults resulting in limited 0.15% capacity and 0.004%
power fade can be effectively detected by the local approach. The algorithm is
also able to correctly isolate faults related with sensitive parameters,
whereas parameters with low sensitivity or linearly correlated are more
difficult to precise.

understanding the physical processes of hydrogen reionization. Currently, this

estimation will play an increasingly important role in setting robust
measurements. Using the delay power spectrum approach, we have produced a
critical examination of different ways that one can estimate error bars on the
power spectrum. We do this through a synthesis of analytic work, simulations of
toy models, and tests on small amounts of real data. We find that, although
computed independently, the different error bar methodologies are in good
agreement with each other in the noise-dominated regime of the power spectrum.
For our preferred methodology, the predicted probability distribution function
is consistent with the empirical noise power distributions from both simulated

misaligned high spatial-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image without parametric
side information. In this paper, we propose a fast approach to blind
pansharpening and achieve state-of-the-art image reconstruction quality.
Typical blind pansharpening algorithms are often computationally intensive
since the blur kernel and the target HRMS image are often computed using
iterative solvers and in an alternating fashion. To achieve fast blind
pansharpening, we decouple the solution of the blur kernel and of the HRMS
image. First, we estimate the blur kernel by computing the kernel coefficients
with minimum total generalized variation that blur a downsampled version of the
PAN image to approximate a linear combination of the LRMS image channels. Then,
we estimate each channel of the HRMS image using local Laplacian prior to
regularize the relationship between each HRMS channel and the PAN image.
Solving the HRMS image is accelerated by both parallelizing across the channels
and by fast numerical algorithms for each channel. Due to the fast scheme and
the powerful priors we used on the blur kernel coefficients (total generalized
variation) and on the cross-channel relationship (local Laplacian prior),
numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art model-based counterparts in terms of both computational time

interpolate the training set even for large perturbation radii, but at the cost
of large test error on clean samples. To investigate this gap, we decompose the
test risk into its bias and variance components and study their behavior as a
function of adversarial training perturbation radii ($\varepsilon$). We find
that the bias increases monotonically with $\varepsilon$ and is the dominant
term in the risk. Meanwhile, the variance is unimodal as a function of
$\varepsilon$, peaking near the interpolation threshold for the training set.
This characteristic behavior occurs robustly across different datasets and also
for other robust training procedures such as randomized smoothing. It thus
provides a test for proposed explanations of the generalization gap. We find
that some existing explanations fail this test--for instance, by predicting a
monotonically increasing variance curve. This underscores the power of
bias-variance decompositions in modern settings-by providing two measurements
instead of one, they can rule out more explanations than test accuracy alone.
We also show that bias and variance can provide useful guidance for scalably
reducing the generalization gap, highlighting pre-training and unlabeled data
as promising routes.

vision in recent years, one important aspect has received surprisingly little

Typically, to be efficient, the input images are resized to a relatively small
spatial resolution (e.g. 224x224), and both training and inference are carried
out at this resolution. The actual mechanism for this re-scaling has been an
afterthought: Namely, off-the-shelf image resizers such as bilinear and bicubic
are commonly used in most machine learning software frameworks. But do these
resizers limit the on task performance of the trained networks? The answer is
yes. Indeed, we show that the typical linear resizer can be replaced with
learned resizers that can substantially improve performance. Importantly, while
the classical resizers typically result in better perceptual quality of the
downscaled images, our proposed learned resizers do not necessarily give better
visual quality, but instead improve task performance. Our learned image resizer
is jointly trained with a baseline vision model. This learned CNN-based resizer
creates machine friendly visual manipulations that lead to a consistent
improvement of the end task metric over the baseline model. Specifically, here
we focus on the classification task with the ImageNet dataset, and experiment
with four different models to learn resizers adapted to each model. Moreover,
we show that the proposed resizer can also be useful for fine-tuning the
classification baselines for other vision tasks. To this end, we experiment

Robinson","Analytic model for feature maps in the primary visual cortex","28 pages, 15 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A compact analytic model is proposed to describe the combined orientation
preference (OP) and ocular dominance (OD) features of simple cells and their
layout in the primary visual cortex (V1). This model consists of three parts:
(i) an anisotropic Laplacian (AL) operator that represents the local neural
sensitivity to the orientation of visual inputs; (ii) a receptive field (RF)
operator that models the anisotropic spatial RF that projects to a given V1
cell over scales of a few tenths of a millimeter and combines with the AL
operator to give an overall OP operator; and (iii) a map that describes how the
parameters of these operators vary approximately periodically across V1. The
parameters of the proposed model maximize the neural response at a given OP
with an OP tuning curve fitted to experimental results. It is found that the
anisotropy of the AL operator does not significantly affect OP selectivity,
which is dominated by the RF anisotropy, consistent with Hubel and Wiesel's
original conclusions that orientation tuning width of V1 simple cell is
inversely related to the elongation of its RF. A simplified OP-OD map is then
constructed to describe the approximately periodic OP-OD structure of V1 in a
compact form. Specifically, the map is approximated by retaining its dominant
spatial Fourier coefficients, which are shown to suffice to reconstruct the
overall structure of the OP-OD map. This representation is a suitable form to
analyze observed maps compactly and to be used in neural field theory of V1.
Application to independently simulated V1 structures shows that observed

and squeezing are desired for applications in quantum information, metrology,
and sensing. However, fine-grained control over these properties is hard to
achieve, especially for two-photon sources. Here, we propose a new mechanism
for generating entangled and squeezed photon pairs using superluminal and/or
accelerating modulations of the refractive index in a medium. By leveraging
time-changing dielectric media, where quantum vacuum fluctuations of the
electromagnetic field can be converted into photon pairs, we show that energy-
and momentum-conservation in multi-mode systems give rise to frequency and
angle correlations of photon pairs which are controlled by the trajectory of
the index modulation. These radiation effects are two-photon analogues of
Cherenkov and synchrotron radiation by moving charged particles such as free
electrons. We find the particularly intriguing result that synchrotron-like
radiation into photon pairs exhibits frequency correlations which can enable
the realization of a heralded single photon frequency comb. We conclude with a
general discussion of experimental viability, showing how solitons, ultrashort
pulses, and nonlinear waveguides may enable pathways to realize this two-photon
emission mechanism. For completeness, we discuss in the Supplementary
Information how these effects, sensitive to the local density of photonic
states, can be strongly enhanced using photonic nanostructures. As an example,
we show that index modulations propagating near the surface of graphene produce
entangled pairs of graphene plasmons with high efficiency, leading to
additional experimental opportunities.

coefficients are assumed to be functions of the temperature, and the shear
viscosity coefficient may vanish as the temperature goes to zero. The proof is
to apply Galerkin method to a suitable approximate system with several
parameters and obtain uniform estimates for the approximate solutions. The key
ingredient in obtaining the required estimates is to apply De Giorgi's
iteration to the modified temperature equation, from which we can get a lower
bound for the temperature not depending on the artificial viscosity coefficient
introduced in the modified momentum equation, which makes the compactness
argument available as the artificial viscous term vanishes.

solution of partial differential equations (PDE). The parameters of the network
are trained to represent the initial state of the system only, and are
subsequently updated dynamically, without any further training, to provide an
accurate prediction of the evolution of the PDE system. In this framework, the
network parameters are treated as functions with respect to the appropriate
coordinate and are numerically updated using the governing equations. By
marching the neural network weights in the parameter space, EDNN can predict
state-space trajectories that are indefinitely long, which is difficult for
other neural network approaches. Boundary conditions of the PDEs are treated as
hard constraints, are embedded into the neural network, and are therefore
exactly satisfied throughout the entire solution trajectory. Several
applications including the heat equation, the advection equation, the Burgers
equation, the Kuramoto Sivashinsky equation and the Navier-Stokes equations are
solved to demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of EDNN. The application of
EDNN to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation embeds the divergence-free
constraint into the network design so that the projection of the momentum
equation to solenoidal space is implicitly achieved. The numerical results
verify the accuracy of EDNN solutions relative to analytical and benchmark

different solar phenomena in the corona. The structure and evolution of the 3D
coronal magnetic field are still not very well known. A way to get the 3D
structure of the coronal magnetic field is by performing magnetic field
extrapolations from the photosphere to the corona. In previous work, it was
shown that by prescribing the 3D reconstructed loops' geometry, the magnetic
field extrapolation finds a solution with a better agreement between the
modeled field and the reconstructed loops. Also, it improves the quality of the
field extrapolation. Stereoscopy represents the classical method for performing
3D coronal loop reconstruction. It uses at least two view directions. When only
one vantage point of the coronal loops is available, other 3D reconstruction
methods must be applied. Within this work, we present a method for the 3D loop
reconstruction based on machine learning. Our purpose for developing this
method is to use as many observed coronal loops in space and time for the
modeling of the coronal magnetic field. Our results show that we can build
machine learning models that can retrieve 3D loops based only on their
projection information. In the end, the neural network model will be able to
use only 2D information of the coronal loops, identified, traced and extracted
from the EUV images, for the calculation of their 3D geometry.

concerns radiative line-driven winds. Using UV and visible spectroscopic data
and the radiative transfer code CMFGEN, I investigated the weak wind phenomenon
on a sample of nine Galactic O stars. This study shows for the first time that
the weak wind phenomenon, originally found for O dwarfs, also exists on more
evolved O stars and that future studies must evaluate its impact on the
evolution of massive stars. My other line of research concerns the study of
classical Be stars, the fastest rotators among the non-degenerated stars, and
which are surrounded by rotating equatorial disks. I studied the Be star

spectro-interferometric observations, the radiative transfer code HDUST, and
developing new automatic procedures to better constrain the kinematics of the

(SLSNe-I) before the main peaks offers an important clue to their energy source
mechanisms. In this paper, we updated an analytic magnetar-powered model for
fitting the multi-band light curves of double-peaked SLSNe-I: the early bump is
powered by magnetar-driven shock breakout thermal emission, and the main peak
is powered by a radiative diffusion through the SN ejecta as in the standard
magnetar-powered model. Generally, the diffusive luminosity is greater than the
shock breakout luminosity at the early time, which makes the shock breakout
bumps usually not clearly seen as observed. To obtain a clear double-peaked
light curve, inefficient magnetar heating at early times is required. This
model is applied to three well-observed double-peaked SLSNe-I (i.e., SN2006oz,
LSQ14bdq, and DES14Xtaz). We find that a relative massive SN ejecta with
$M_{\mathrm{ej}} \simeq 10.2-18.1 M_{\odot}$ and relative large kinetic energy
of SN ejecta $E_{\mathrm{sn}} \simeq (3.8-6.5) \times 10^{51}$ erg are
required, and the thermalization efficiency of the magnetar heating is
suppressed before $t_{\mathrm{delay}}$, which are in the range of $\simeq 15-
43$ days. The model can well reproduce the observed light curves, with a
reasonable and similar set of physical parameters for both the early bump and
the main peak, strengthening support for magnetar-powered model. In the future,
modeling of the double-peaked SLSNe-I will become more feasible as more events
are discovered before the early bump.

task. A point-cloud consists of a sparse, unstructured, and unordered set of
points. To understand a point-cloud, previous point-based methods, such as
PointNet++, extract visual features through hierarchically aggregation of local
features. However, such methods have several critical limitations: 1) Such
methods require several sampling and grouping operations, which slow down the
inference speed. 2) Such methods spend an equal amount of computation on each
points in a point-cloud, though many of points are redundant. 3) Such methods
aggregate local features together through downsampling, which leads to
information loss and hurts the perception performance. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel, simple, and elegant deep learning model called
YOGO (You Only Group Once). Compared with previous methods, YOGO only needs to
sample and group a point-cloud once, so it is very efficient. Instead of
operating on points, YOGO operates on a small number of tokens, each of which
summarizes the point features in a sub-region. This allows us to avoid
computing on the redundant points and thus boosts efficiency.Moreover, YOGO
preserves point-wise features by projecting token features to point features
although the computation is performed on tokens. This avoids information loss
and can improve point-wise perception performance. We conduct thorough
experiments to demonstrate that YOGO achieves at least 3.0x speedup over
point-based baselines while delivering competitive classification and
segmentation performance on the ModelNet, ShapeNetParts and S3DIS datasets.

intelligence. The workhorse of deep learning is the optimization of loss
functions by stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Traditionally in deep learning,
neural networks are differentiable mathematical functions, and the loss
gradients required for SGD are computed with the backpropagation algorithm.
However, the computer architectures on which these neural networks are
implemented and trained suffer from speed and energy inefficiency issues, due
to the separation of memory and processing in these architectures. To solve
these problems, the field of neuromorphic computing aims at implementing neural
networks on hardware architectures that merge memory and processing, just like
brains do. In this thesis, we argue that building large, fast and efficient
neural networks on neuromorphic architectures also requires rethinking the
algorithms to implement and train them. We present an alternative mathematical
framework, also compatible with SGD, which offers the possibility to design
neural networks in substrates that directly exploit the laws of physics. Our
framework applies to a very broad class of models, namely those whose state or
dynamics are described by variational equations. This includes physical systems
whose equilibrium state minimizes an energy function, and physical systems
whose trajectory minimizes an action functional. We present a simple procedure
to compute the loss gradients in such systems, called equilibrium propagation
(EqProp), which requires solely locally available information for each
trainable parameter. Since many models in physics and engineering can be
described by variational principles, our framework has the potential to be
applied to a broad variety of physical systems whose applications extend to
various fields of engineering, beyond neuromorphic computing.

asset and a short position of a ""replicate portfolio"" of its peers represent
that asset's factor residual risk. We coin the expected return of an asset's
factor residual risk as its Statistical Arbitrage Risk Premium (SARP). The
challenge in empirically estimating SARP is finding the peers for each asset

stock. The resulting high-dimensional but sparse projection vector serves as
investment weights in constructing the stocks' replicate portfolios. We say a

bits as highly reliable bits (HRBs), highly unreliable bits (HUBs), and
uncertain bits to improve the performance of hard-decision (HD) decoders. The
HRBs and HUBs are used to assist the HD decoders to prevent miscorrections and
to decode those originally uncorrectable cases via bit flipping (BF),
respectively. In this paper, an improved SABM algorithm (called iSABM) is
proposed for staircase codes (SCCs). Similar to the SABM, iSABM marks bits with
the help of channel reliabilities, i.e., using the absolute values of the
log-likelihood ratios. The improvements offered by iSABM include: (i) HUBs
being classified using a reliability threshold, (ii) BF randomly selecting
HUBs, and (iii) soft-aided decoding over multiple SCC blocks. The decoding
complexity of iSABM is comparable of that of SABM. This is due to the fact that
on the one hand no sorting is required (lower complexity) because of the use of
a threshold for HUBs, while on the other hand multiple SCC blocks use soft
information (higher complexity). Additional gains of up to 0.53 dB with respect
to SABM and 0.91 dB with respect to standard SCC decoding at a bit error rate
of $10^{-6}$ are reported. Furthermore, it is shown that using 1-bit
reliability marking, i.e., only having HRBs and HUBs, only causes a gain
penalty of up to 0.25 dB with a significantly reduced memory requirement.

with the unitary. This unitary stabilizer nullity extends the state-stabilizer
nullity by Beverland et al. to a dynamic version. In particular, we show this

above properties in gate synthesis. Third, we compare the state- and the
unitary-stabilizer nullity, proving that the lower bounds for the $T$ count
obtained by the unitary-stabilizer nullity are never less than the
state-stabilizer nullity. Moreover, we show an explicit $n$-qubit unitary
family of unitary-stabilizer nullity $2n$, which implies that its $T$ count is
at least $2n$. This gives an example where the bounds derived by the
unitary-stabilizer nullity strictly outperform the state-stabilizer nullity by
a factor of $2$. We finally showcase the advantages of unitary-stabilizer
nullity in estimating the $T$ count of quantum gates with interests.

does not allow scientists to gain physical insights about the problem at hand.
Many different methods have been introduced in the emerging field of
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aim at attributing the network
s prediction to specific features in the input domain. XAI methods are usually
assessed by using benchmark datasets (like MNIST or ImageNet for image
classification). However, an objective, theoretically derived ground truth for
the attribution is lacking for most of these datasets, making the assessment of
XAI in many cases subjective. Also, benchmark datasets specifically designed
for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on
the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark
datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution
is known a priori. We generate a large benchmark dataset and train a fully
connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for
simulation. We then compare estimated heatmaps from different XAI methods to
the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods
perform well or poorly. We believe that attribution benchmarks as the ones
introduced herein are of great importance for further application of neural
networks in the geosciences, and for more objective assessment and accurate
implementation of XAI methods, which will increase model trust and assist in

opportunities for infrared nanophotonics due to sub-diffraction confinement
with low optical losses. Though the polaritonic field confinement can be
significantly improved by modifying the dielectric environment, it is
challenging to break the fundamental limits in photon confinement and
propagation behavior of SPhP modes. In particular, as SPhPs inherently
propagate isotropically in these bulk polar dielectrics, how to collectively
realize ultra-large field confinement, in-plane hyperbolicity and
unidirectional propagation remains elusive. Here, we report an approach to
solve the aforementioned issues of bulk polar dielectric's SPhPs at one go by
constructing a heterostructural interface between biaxial van der Waals
material (e.g., MoO3) and bulk polar dielectric (e.g., SiC, AlN, and GaN). Due
to anisotropy-oriented mode couplings at the interface, the hybridized SPhPs
with a large confinement factor (>100) show in-plane hyperbolicity that has
been switched to the orthogonal direction as compared to that in natural MoO3.
More interestingly, this proof of concept allows steerable, angle-dependent and
unidirectional polariton excitation by suspending MoO3 on patterned SiC air
cavities. Our finding exemplifies a generalizable framework to manipulate the
flow of nano-light and engineer unusual polaritonic responses in many other
hybrid systems consisting of van der Waals materials and bulk polar
dielectrics.

I}\subset\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ is the Iwahori subalgebra of the affine Lie
algebra and $\xi$ is a formal odd variable. The Euler characteristic of graded
characters of a complex of ${\mathfrak I}[\xi]$-modules is considered as an
element of a polynomial representation. First, we show that the compositions of
induction and restriction functors associated with minimal parabolic
subalgebras ${\mathfrak{p}}_{i}$ categorify Demazure operators
$T_i+1\in{\mathcal{H}\kern -.4em\mathcal{H}}$, meaning that all algebraic
relations of $T_i$ have categorical meanings. Second, we describe a natural
collection of complexes ${\mathbb{EM}}_{\lambda}$ of ${\mathfrak
I}[\xi]$-modules whose Euler characteristic is equal to nonsymmetric Macdonald
polynomials $E_\lambda$ for dominant $\lambda$ and a natural collection of
complexes of $\mathfrak{g}[z,\xi]$-modules ${\mathbb{PM}}_{\lambda}$ whose
Euler characteristic is equal to the symmetric Macdonald polynomial
$P_{\lambda}$.
  We illustrate our theory with the example $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_2$
where we construct the cyclic representations of Lie superalgebra ${\mathfrak
I}[\xi]$ such that their supercharacters coincide with renormalizations of
nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials.

  Problems","Accepted for SSVM 2021",,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  L-BFGS is the state-of-the-art optimization method for many large scale
inverse problems. It has a small memory footprint and achieves superlinear
convergence. The method approximates Hessian based on an initial approximation
and an update rule that models current local curvature information. The initial
approximation greatly affects the scaling of a search direction and the overall
convergence of the method.
  We propose a novel, simple, and effective way to initialize the Hessian.
Typically, the objective function is a sum of a data-fidelity term and a
regularizer. Often, the Hessian of the data-fidelity is computationally
challenging, but the regularizer's Hessian is easy to compute.
  We replace the Hessian of the data-fidelity with a scalar and keep the
Hessian of the regularizer to initialize the Hessian approximation at every
iteration. The scalar satisfies the secant equation in the sense of ordinary
and total least squares and geometric mean regression. Our new strategy not
only leads to faster convergence, but the quality of the numerical solutions is
generally superior to simple scaling based strategies. Specifically, the
proposed schemes based on ordinary least squares formulation and geometric mean
regression outperform the state-of-the-art schemes.
  The implementation of our strategy requires only a small change of a standard
L-BFGS code. Our experiments on convex quadratic problems and non-convex image
registration problems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

vaccination prioritization depends on the reproduction number R0. Specifically,
the elderly should be prioritized only when R0 is relatively high. If ongoing
intervention policies, such as universal masking, could suppress R0 at a
relatively low level, prioritizing the high-transmission age group (i.e.,

sub-networks: 1) feature learning, 2) cross-modal mapping, and 3) audio
generation. First, the feature learning sub-network aims to learn semantic
features from image and audio, including image feature learning and audio
feature learning. Second, the cross-modal mapping sub-network transforms the
image feature into a cross-modal representation with the same semantic concept
as the audio feature. In this way, the correlation of inter-modal data is
effectively mined for easing the heterogeneous gap between image and audio.
Finally, the audio generation sub-network is designed to generate the audio
waveform from the cross-modal representation. The generated audio waveform is
interpolated to obtain the corresponding audio file according to the sample
frequency. Being the first attempt to explore the I2AD task, three large-scale

Recently, multiplesolution inpainting methods have been proposed and shown the
potential of generating diverse results. However, these methods have difficulty
in ensuring the quality of each solution, e.g. they produce distorted structure
and/or blurry texture. We propose a two-stage model for diverse inpainting,
where the first stage generates multiple coarse results each of which has a
different structure, and the second stage refines each coarse result separately
by augmenting texture. The proposed model is inspired by the hierarchical
vector quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), whose hierarchical
architecture isentangles structural and textural information. In addition, the
vector quantization in VQVAE enables autoregressive modeling of the discrete
distribution over the structural information. Sampling from the distribution
can easily generate diverse and high-quality structures, making up the first
stage of our model. In the second stage, we propose a structural attention
module inside the texture generation network, where the module utilizes the
structural information to capture distant correlations. We further reuse the
VQ-VAE to calculate two feature losses, which help improve structure coherence
and texture realism, respectively. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ, Places2,

new concept referred to as the scale-based inference. The basic idea is that
more accurate prediction can be made by exploiting scale information of a time
series. We first propose a nonparametric predictor based on $k$-nearest
neighbors with an optimally chosen $k$ for a single time series. Based on that,
we focus on a specific but important type of scale information, the
resolution/sampling rate of time series data. We then propose an algorithm to
sequentially predict time series using past data at various resolutions. We
prove that asymptotically the algorithm produces the mean prediction error that
is no larger than the best possible algorithm at any single resolution, under

trained in self-supervised manners. Second, the poses predicted by CNNs are
further improved by minimizing photometric errors via gradient updates of poses

Different from online-learning methods, DOC does not need to calculate gradient
propagation for parameters of CNNs. Thus, it saves more computation resources
during inference phases. 2) Unlike hybrid methods that combine CNNs with
traditional methods, DOC fully relies on deep learning (DL) frameworks. Though

clusters -- known as `simple stellar populations' (SSPs) -- is a view of the
past. Photometric and spectroscopic studies reveal that almost all ancient
globular clusters in the Milky Way and our neighbouring galaxies exhibit
star-to-star light-element abundance variations, typically known as 'multiple
populations' (MPs). Here, we analyse photometric $\it Hubble$ $\it Space$ $\it
Telescope$ observations of three young ($<$2 Gyr-old) Large and Small
Magellanic Cloud clusters, NGC 411, NGC 1718 and NGC 2213. We measure the
widths of their red-giant branches (RGBs). For NGC 411, we also use a
pseudo-colour--magnitude diagram (pseudo-CMD) to assess its RGB for evidence of
MPs. We compare the morphologies of the clusters' RGBs with artificially
generated SSPs. We conclude that their RGBs do not show evidence of significant
broadening beyond intrinsic photometric scatter, suggesting an absence of
significant chemical abundance variations in our sample clusters. Specifically,
for NGC 411, NGC 1718 and NGC 2213 we derive maximum helium-abundance
variations of delta_Y=0.003$\pm$0.001 Y=0.300), 0.002$\pm$0.001 (Y=0.350) and
0.004$\pm$0.002 (Y=0.300), respectively. We determined an upper limit to the
NGC 411 nitrogen-abundance variation of $\Delta$[N/Fe] = 0.3 dex; the available
data for our other clusters do not allow us to determine useful upper limits.
It thus appears that the transition from SSPs to MPs occurs at an age of ~2
Gyr, implying that age might play an important role in this transition. This
raises the question as to whether this is indeed a fundamental minimum-age
limit for the formation of MPs.

electromagnetic antennas difficult to be implemented in miniaturized or
portable devices. This article presents a miniaturized LF magnetoelectric(ME)
receiving antenna with an integrated DC magnetic bias. The antenna is based on
the magnetoelectric effect and operates by resonance at its mechanical resonant
frequency. Thus, compared with traditional LF wire antennas, the dimension of
ME antenna is reduced significantly. Compared with prior art of ME antennas
which do not have DC magnetic bias, higher performance can be achieved by
integrating the miniaturized DC magnetic bias. Compared with prior art of an ME
antenna with bulky external DC magnetic bias, the ME antenna with an integrated
DC magnetic bias significantly reduce its dimension. Magnetostrictive
TbDyFe2(Terfenol-D) and piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate(PZT) thin films
are bonded together to form the 38x12x5.8mm3 ME receiving antenna. Four
10x10x10mm3 Rb magnets are implemented to provide an optimal DC bias for the
antenna. A maximum operation distance of 2.5m is demonstrated with the DC
magnetic field bias, 2.27 times of the maximum operation distance of the
antenna without DC magnet field bias. The efficiency, gain and quality factor
the ME receiving antenna is also characterized. The miniaturized LF ME antenna
could have potential applications in portable electronics, internet of things
and underwater communications.

view representation is more compact and without quantization error. Although
there are works adopting it for semantic segmentation, its performance in
object detection is largely behind voxelized or BEV counterparts. We first

the inconsistency between the 2D range image coordinates used in feature

deliberately design three components to address these issues in our RangeDet.

networks by transferring the knowledge from a large model into a smaller one.
Most existing approaches enhance the student model by utilizing the similarity
information between the categories of instance level provided by the teacher
model. However, these works ignore the similarity correlation between different
instances that plays an important role in confidence prediction. To tackle this
issue, we propose a novel method in this paper, called similarity transfer for
knowledge distillation (STKD), which aims to fully utilize the similarities
between categories of multiple samples. Furthermore, we propose to better
capture the similarity correlation between different instances by the mixup
technique, which creates virtual samples by a weighted linear interpolation.
Note that, our distillation loss can fully utilize the incorrect classes
similarities by the mixed labels. The proposed approach promotes the
performance of student model as the virtual sample created by multiple images
produces a similar probability distribution in the teacher and student
networks. Experiments and ablation studies on several public classification
datasets including CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100,CINIC-10 and Tiny-ImageNet verify that
this light-weight method can effectively boost the performance of the compact
student model. It shows that STKD substantially has outperformed the vanilla
knowledge distillation and has achieved superior accuracy over the
state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods.

one-way streets and their effect on shortest paths are usually ignored. Here,
we first study the empirical effect of one-way streets in about $140$ cities in
the world. Their presence induces a detour that persists over a wide range of
distances and characterized by a non-universal exponent. The effect of one-ways
on the pattern of shortest paths is then twofold: they mitigate local traffic
in certain areas but create bottlenecks elsewhere. This empirical study leads
naturally to consider a mixed graph model of 2d regular lattices with both
undirected links and a diluted variable fraction $p$ of randomly directed links
which mimics the presence of one-ways in a street network. We study the size of
the strongly connected component (SCC) versus $p$ and demonstrate the existence
of a threshold $p_c$ above which the SCC size is zero. We show numerically that
this transition is non-trivial for lattices with degree less than $4$ and
provide some analytical argument. We compute numerically the critical exponents
for this transition and confirm previous results showing that they define a new
universality class different from both the directed and standard percolation.
Finally, we show that the transition on real-world graphs can be understood
with random perturbations of regular lattices. The impact of one-ways on the
graph properties were already the subject of a few mathematical studies, and
our results show that this problem has also interesting connections with
percolation, a classical model in statistical physics.

to infinity when the time tends to infinity and so there occur some
instabilities. Instead, when the approximation orders are lower than or equal
to four, this is not the case and there is the need to study the compatibility
with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. To this aim the related constitutive
equation is reformulated within the system of the fading memory theory, and
thus the heat flux vector is written in terms of the history of the temperature
gradient and on this basis the compatibility of the model with the
thermodynamical principles is analyzed.

generalized $p$-ary functions. In this paper, we focus on the constructions of
generalized $p$-ary $s$-plateaued functions from $V_{n}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$,
where $V_{n}$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$, $p$ is
a prime, $k\geq 1$ and $n+s$ is even when $p=2$. In particular, when $k=1$, the
constructions in this paper are applicable for plateaued functions. Firstly,
inspired by the work of Hod\v{z}i\'{c} \emph{et al}. \cite{Hodzic3} for Boolean
plateaued functions, we characterize generalized plateaued functions with
affine Walsh supports and provide constructions of generalized plateaued
functions with (non)-affine Walsh supports by spectral method. When $p=2, k=1$,
our constructions of Boolean plateaued functions with (non)-affine Walsh
supports provide an answer to the Open Problem 2 proposed in \cite{Hodzic3}.
Secondly, based on what we called generalized indirect sum, we give
constructions of generalized plateaued functions, which are also applicable for
(non)-weakly regular generalized bent functions. In the end, we discuss the
constructions of pairwise disjoint spectra generalized plateaued functions with
(non)-affine Walsh supports and we present a construction of generalized bent

objects and domains. This certitude has recently been challenged by the
possible detection of anti-helium nuclei by AMS-02. Should the observation be
confirmed, the existence of nearby antistars would make a plausible hypothesis
to explain the origin of the antinuclei. In this paper we use the 10-years
Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) gamma-ray source catalog to set constraints on
the abundance of antistars around the Sun. We identify in the catalog 14
antistar candidates not associated with any objects belonging to established
gamma-ray source classes and with a spectrum compatible with baryon-antibaryon
annihilation. We use them along with an estimate of the LAT sensitivity to
antistars to set upper limits on the local antistar fraction $f_{\bar{\ast}}$
with respect to normal stars. We provide parametric limits as a function of the
closest antistar mass, velocity, and surrounding matter density. We also employ
a novel Monte~Carlo method to set limits for a few hypotheses about the
antistar population. For a population with properties equivalent to those of
regular stars concentrated in the Galactic disk we obtain $f_{\bar{\ast}} < 2.5
\times 10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level, which is 20 times more constraining
than limits previously available. For a primordial population of antistars
distributed in the Galactic halo we obtain new local upper limits which
decrease as a function of antistar mass $M$ from $f_{\bar{\ast}} < 0.2$ at 95\%
confidence level for $M = 1 \; M_\odot$ to $f_{\bar{\ast}} < 1.6 \times
10^{-4}$ at 95\% confidence level for $M = 10 \; M_\odot$. By combining these
limits with existing microlensing constraints for lighter objects in the
Magellanic clouds, we infer that a primordial population of halo antistars must
have a density lower than $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}\;\text{pc}^{-3})$ to
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}\;\text{pc}^{-3})$ depending on their masses. Our limits
can constrain models for the origin and propagation of antinuclei in cosmic

tools and techniques that provide testing solutions either for different

Third, we provide a set of future research directions based on the identified

entails additional computational and statistical challenges, compared to the

address these issues in the densely observed regime. Instead, we consider the
sparse regime, where the latent surfaces are observed only at few irregular
locations with additive measurement error, and propose an estimator of
covariance based on local linear smoothers. Consequently, the assumption of
separability reduces the intrinsically four-dimensional smoothing problem into
several two-dimensional smoothers and allows the proposed estimator to retain
the classical minimax-optimal convergence rate for two-dimensional smoothers.
Even when separability fails to hold, imposing it can be still advantageous as
a form of regularization. A simulation study reveals a favorable bias-variance
trade-off and massive speed-ups achieved by our approach. Finally, the proposed
methodology is used for qualitative analysis of implied volatility surfaces
corresponding to call options, and for prediction of the latent surfaces based
on information from the entire data set, allowing for uncertainty
quantification. Our cross-validated out-of-sample quantitative results show
that the proposed methodology outperforms the common approach of pre-smoothing
every implied volatility surface separately.

properties such as adhesion, friction, wear, and biocompatibility. However, the
understanding of multi-scale topography, and its effect on properties, has been
hindered by conventional measurement methods, which capture only a single
length scale. Here, four different polycrystalline diamond coatings are
characterized using transmission electron microscopy to assess the roughness
down to the sub-nanometer scale. Then these measurements are combined, using
the power spectral density (PSD), with conventional methods (stylus
profilometry and atomic force microscopy) to characterize all scales of
topography. The results demonstrate the critical importance of measuring
topography across all length scales, especially because their PSDs cross over
one another, such that a surface that is rougher at a larger scale may be
smoother at a smaller scale and vice versa. Furthermore, these measurements
reveal the connection between multi-scale topography and grain size, with
characteristic scaling behavior at and slightly below the mean grain size, and
self-affine fractal-like roughness at other length scales. At small (subgrain)
scales, unpolished surfaces exhibit a common form of residual roughness that is
self-affine in nature but difficult to detect with conventional methods. This
approach of capturing topography from the atomic- to the macro-scale is termed
comprehensive topography characterization, and all of the topography data from

unknown signal has to be recovered from the phaseless measurements with respect
to a dynamical frame, i.e. a sequence of sampling vectors constructed by the
repeated action of an operator. The loss of the phase here turns the well-posed
dynamical sampling into a severe ill-posed inverse problem. In the existing
literature, the involved operator is usually completely known. In this paper,
we combine phase retrieval in dynamical sampling with the identification of the
system. For instance, if the dynamical frame is based on a repeated
convolution, then we want to recover the unknown convolution kernel in advance.
Using Prony's method, we establish several recovery guarantees for signal and
system, whose proofs are constructive and yield analytic recovery methods. The
required assumptions are satisfied by almost all signals, operators, and
sampling vectors. Moreover, these guarantees not only hold for the
finite-dimensional setting but also carry over to infinite-dimensional spaces.
Studying the sensitivity of the analytic recovery procedures, we also establish

a solid/solid interface remain an open question. We present a fully quantum
theoretical scheme to quantify the effect of anharmonic phonon-phonon
scattering at an interface via non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
formalism. Based on the real-space scattering rate matrix, a decomposition of
the interfacial spectral energy exchange is made into contributions from local
and non-local anharmonic interactions, of which the former is shown to be
predominant for high-frequency phonons whereas both are important for
low-frequency phonons. The anharmonic decay of interfacial phonon modes is
revealed to play a crucial role in bridging the bulk modes across the
interface. The overall quantitative contribution of anharmonicity to thermal
boundary conductance is found to be moderate. The present work promotes a
deeper understanding of heat transport at the interface and an intuitive
interpretation of anharmonic phonon NEGF formalism.

off a large nucleus at total rapidity $Y$ and requiring a minimum rapidity gap
$Y_{\text{gap}}$ can be identified, in a well-defined parametric limit, with a
simple classical observable on the stochastic process representing the
evolution of the state of the onium, as its rapidity increases, in the form of
color dipole branchings: It formally coincides with twice the probability that
an even number of these dipoles effectively participate in the scattering, when
viewed in a frame in which the onium is evolved to the rapidity
$Y-Y_{\text{gap}}$. Consequently, finding asymptotic solutions to the
Kovchegov-Levin equation, which rules the $Y$-dependence of the diffractive
cross section, boils down to solving a probabilistic problem. Such a
formulation authorizes the derivation of a parameter-free analytical expression
for the gap distribution. Interestingly enough, events in which many dipoles
interact simultaneously play an important role, since the distribution of the
number $k$ of dipoles participating in the interaction turns out to be
proportional to $1/[k(k-1)]$.

investigate in this work the problem of conflicting performance between

existing methods and analyze their restrictions in terms of accuracy and
robustness. Specifically, 4 formulations-offline classification (OFC), offline

of robust localization suppressing distractors via ONR and the accurate
localization attending to the target center precisely via OFC. To yield a final

voting strategy to involve adjacent predictions such that the final
representation does not commit to a single location. Operating beyond the

  Pedestrian Detection","This manuscript is waiting for further improvement",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accurate pedestrian classification and localization have received
considerable attention due to their wide applications such as security
monitoring, autonomous driving, etc. Although pedestrian detectors have made
great progress in recent years, the fixed Intersection over Union (IoU) based
assignment-regression manner still limits their performance. Two main factors
are responsible for this: 1) the IoU threshold faces a dilemma that a lower one
will result in more false positives, while a higher one will filter out the
matched positives; 2) the IoU-based GT-Proposal assignment suffers from the
inconsistent supervision problem that spatially adjacent proposals with similar
features are assigned to different ground-truth boxes, which means some very
similar proposals may be forced to regress towards different targets, and thus
confuses the bounding-box regression when predicting the location results. In
this paper, we first put forward the question that \textbf{Regression
Direction} would affect the performance for pedestrian detection. Consequently,
we address the weakness of IoU by introducing one geometric sensitive search
algorithm as a new assignment and regression metric. Different from the
previous IoU-based \textbf{one-to-one} assignment manner of one proposal to one
ground-truth box, the proposed method attempts to seek a reasonable matching
between the sets of proposals and ground-truth boxes. Specifically, we boost
the MR-FPPI under R$_{75}$ by 8.8\% on Citypersons dataset. Furthermore, by
incorporating this method as a metric into the state-of-the-art pedestrian
detectors, we show a consistent improvement.

translation invariance given that it is combined with sufficient similarity

homogeneity. We also observe that this characteristic is dataset-specific and
dictates the relationship between pooling kernel size and stride required for
translation invariance. Furthermore we find that a trade-off exists between
generalization and translation invariance in the case of pooling kernel size,

ratio (0.198 +- 0.005) deep (63.7 +- 7.9%) contact binary, indicating that it
has been already at the end evolutionary stage of tidally-locked evolution via
magnetized wind. Because of the totally eclipsing character, the photometric
solutions are reliable. The temperature and the metallicity are determined from
the spectroscopic data as T = 5855 +- 15 K, and [Fe/H] = -0.842 +- 0.031,
respectively. Based on the parallax of Gaia EDR3, the physical parameters of
CSS J022914.4+044340 are estimated as M1 = 1.44 (+0.25,-0.22) solar mass, M2 =
0.29 (+0.05,-0.05) solar mass, R1 = 1.26 (+0.08,-0.06) solar radius, R2 = 0.65

third body via the photometric solution (54%), the luminosity of the third body
is estimated as 2.705 solar luminosity. The third body may be inferred as a
subgiant. Thus, it is explained that why the primary component of CSS
J022914.4+044340 has higher mass among the similar systems, and why its

clusters, with a steep spectral index $\alpha>1$ ($S\propto \nu^{-\alpha}$). It
has been proposed that they arise from particle acceleration induced by
turbulence and weak shocks, injected in the intracluster medium (ICM) during
mergers. MACS J1149.5+2223 (MACS J1149) is a high redshift ($z=0.544$) galaxy
cluster possibly hosting a radio halo and a relic. We analysed LOFAR, GMRT, and
JVLA radio data at 144, 323, 1500 MHz, and Chandra X-ray data to characterise
the thermal and non-thermal properties of the cluster. We obtained radio images
at different frequencies to investigate the spectral properties of the radio
halo. We used Chandra X-ray images to constrain the thermal properties of the
cluster. We measured a steep spectrum of the halo, with $\alpha=1.49\pm 0.12$
between 144 and 1500 MHz. The radio surface brightness distribution across the
halo is found to correlate with the X-ray brightness of the ICM, with a
sub-linear slope in the range 0.4 to 0.6. We also report two possible cold
fronts in north-east and north-west, but deeper X-ray observations are required
to firmly constrain the properties of the upstream emission. We show that the
combination of high redshift, steep radio spectrum, and sub-linear radio-X
scaling of the halo rules out hadronic models. An old ($\sim 1 $ Gyr ago) major
merger likely induced the formation of the halo through stochastic
re-acceleration of relativistic electrons. We suggest that the two possible
X-ray discontinuities may actually be part of the same cold front. In this
case, the coolest gas pushed towards the north-west might be associated with
the cool core of a sub-cluster involved in the major merger. The peculiar
orientation of the south-east relic might indicate a different nature of this
source and requires further investigation.

research tool in the study of climate change for decades. As the demand for
high-resolution simulation is becoming urgent, the scalability and simulation
efficiency is faced with great challenges, especially for the
latitude-longitude mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose a highly
scalable 3D atmospheric general circulation model based on leap-format, namely
AGCM-3DLF. Firstly, it utilizes a 3D decomposition method allowing for
parallelism release in all three physical dimensions. Then the leap-format
difference computation scheme is adopted to maintain computational stability in
grid updating and avoid additional filtering at the high latitudes. A novel
shifting window communication algorithm is designed for parallelization of the
unified model. Furthermore, a series of optimizations are conducted to improve
the effectiveness of large-scale simulations. Experiment results in different
platforms demonstrate good efficiency and scalability of the model. AGCM-3DLF
scales up to the entire CAS-Xiandao1 supercomputer (196,608 CPU cores),
attaining the speed of 11.1 simulation-year-per-day (SYPD) at a high resolution

climate change and the growth of urban areas may further increase the
probability of incidence of large-scale fires. The risk of fire can be lowered
with preventive measures. Among them, firefighting lines are used to stop the
fire from spreading beyond them. Due to high costs of installation and
maintenance, their placement must be carefully planned. In this work, we
address the wildfire management problem from a theoretical point of view and
define a risk function to model the fire diffusion phenomena. The land is
modeled by a mixed graph in which vertices are areas subject to fire with a
certain probability while edges model the probability of fire spreading from
one area to another. To reduce the risk, we introduce the {\sc Windy Firebreak
Location} problem that addresses the optimal positioning of firefighting lines
under budget constraints. We study the complexity of the problem and prove its
hardness even when the graph is planar, bipartite, with maximum degree four and
the propagation probabilities are equal to one. We also show an efficient
polynomial time algorithm for particular instances on trees.

They form a class of (nondegenerate) Poisson varieties attached to colored
quivers whose representation theory is controlled by fission algebras:
noncommutative algebras generalizing the multiplicative preprojective algebras
of Crawley-Boevey and Shaw. Previously, Van den Bergh exploited the
Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle to prove that the natural Poisson structure of
any (non-colored) multiplicative quiver variety is induced by an $H_0$-Poisson
structure on the underlying multiplicative preprojective algebra; indeed, it
turns out that this noncommutative structure comes from a Hamiltonian double
quasi-Poisson algebra constructed from the quiver itself. In this article we
conjecture that, via the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle, the natural Poisson
structure on each colored multiplicative quiver variety is induced by an
$H_0$-Poisson structure on the underlying fission algebra which, in turn, is
obtained from a Hamiltonian double quasi-Poisson algebra attached to the
colored quiver. We study some consequences of this conjecture and we prove it
in two significant cases: the interval and the triangle.

demonstrates that the spectra are composed by dysprosium with different

due to segregation at the region probed by TEY. The topmost layer was

software development. Since its source codes are usually unavailable, software
reuse is hard to be detected with interpretation. On the other hand, current
approaches suffer from poor detection accuracy and efficiency, far from
satisfying practical demands. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we
propose \textit{ISRD}, an interpretation-enabled software reuse detection
approach based on a multi-level birthmark model that contains function level,
basic block level, and instruction level. To overcome obfuscation caused by
cross-compilation, we represent function semantics with Minimum Branch Path
(MBP) and perform normalization to extract core semantics of instructions. For
efficiently detecting reused functions, a process for ""intent search based on
anchor recognition"" is designed to speed up reuse detection. It uses strict
instruction match and identical library call invocation check to find anchor
functions (in short anchors) and then traverses neighbors of the anchors to
explore potentially matched function pairs. Extensive experiments based on two
real-world binary datasets reveal that \textit{ISRD} is interpretable,
effective, and efficient, which achieves $97.2\%$ precision and $94.8\%$
recall. Moreover, it is resilient to cross-compilation, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches.

convergence rates independent of the problem size. The smoother is a crucial
component of multigrid methods and significantly affects its overall
efficiency. We propose a Vanka-type smoother that we refer to as Restricted
Additive Vanka and investigate its convergence in the context of adaptive
geometric multigrid methods for the Stokes equations. The proposed smoother has
the advantage of being an additive method and provides favorable properties in
terms of algorithmic complexity, scalability and applicability to
high-performance computing. We compare the performance of the smoother with two
variants of the classical Vanka smoother using numerical benchmarks for the
Stokes problem. We find that the restricted additive smoother achieves
comparable convergence rates to the classical multiplicative Vanka smoother
while being computationally less expensive per iteration, which results in
faster solution runtimes.

globally hyperbolic and in conservative form. In prior work, the hyperbolic
quadrature method of moments (HyQMOM) was introduced to close this moment
system up to fourth order (n $\le$ 2). Here, HyQMOM is reformulated and
extended to arbitrary even-order moments. The HyQMOM closure is defined based
on the properties of the monic orthogonal polynomials Qn that are uniquely
defined by the velocity moments up to order 2n -- 1. Thus, HyQMOM is strictly a
moment closure and does not rely on the reconstruction of a velocity
distribution function with the same moments. On the boundary of moment space, n
double roots of the characteristic polynomial P2n+1 are the roots of Qn, while
in the interior, P 2n+1 and Qn share n roots. The remaining n + 1 roots of

predict a departure from scale invariance of the power spectrum for scalar

dark energy dominated era. Here, following previous work, we find a departure
of scale invariance for the quantum Fisher information associated to de Sitter
vacuum for scalar quantum spectator modes. This gives rise to a purely quantum
cosmological tilt with a well defined dependence on energy scale. This quantum
tilt is imprinted, in a scale dependent energy uncertainty for the spectator
modes. The effective quasi de Sitter description of this model independent
energy uncertainty uniquely sets the effective quasi de Sitter parameters at
all energy scales. In particular, in the slow-roll regime characterized by an
almost constant $\epsilon$, the quantum Fisher -- model independent --
prediction for the spectral index is $(1-n_s) = 0.0328$ ($n_s=0.9672$).
Moreover, the energy scale dependence of the quantum cosmological tilt implies
the existence of a cosmological phase transition at energies higher than the
CMB scale where the tilt goes from red into blue. This strongly suggest the
existence of a pre-inflationary phase where the effective scalaron contributes
to the spectral index as normal relativistic matter and where the corresponding
growth of the power spectrum can result in dark matter in the form of small
mass primordial black holes. The source and features of the quantum
cosmological tilt leading to these predictions are determined by the
entanglement features of the de Sitter vacuum states.

for an adoptive placement in the United States, where adoptions from foster
care occur through a semi-decentralized search and matching process with the
help of local agencies. Traditionally, most agencies have employed a
family-driven search process, where prospective families respond to
announcements made by the caseworker responsible for a child. However, recently
some agencies switched to a caseworker-driven search process, where the
caseworker conducts a targeted search of suitable families for the child. We
introduce a novel search-and-matching model to capture essential aspects of
adoption and compare these two search processes through a game-theoretical
analysis. We show that the search equilibria induced by (novel) threshold
strategies form a lattice structure under either approach. Our main theoretical
result establishes that the equilibrium outcomes in family-driven search can
never Pareto dominate the outcomes in caseworker-driven search, but there are
instances where each caseworker-driven search outcome Pareto dominates all
family-driven search outcomes. We also find that when families are sufficiently
impatient, caseworker driven search is better for all children. We illustrate
numerically that for a wide range of parameters, most agents are better off
under caseworker-driven search.

have notable static voltage characteristics (ZIP loads). Hence, despite
abundant papers on linear single-phase power flow models, it is still necessary
to study linear three-phase distribution power flow models. To this end, this
paper proposes a physics-based and data-driven linear three-phase power flow
model for DPSs. We first formulate how to amalgamate data-driven techniques
into a physics-based power flow model to obtain our linear model. This
amalgamation makes our linear model independent of the assumptions commonly
used in the literature (e.g., nodal voltages are nearly 1.0 p.u.) and thus have
a relatively high accuracy generally - even when those assumptions become
invalid. We then reveal how to apply our model to the DPSs with ZIP loads. We
also show that with the Huber penalty function employed, the adverse impact of
bad data on our model's accuracy is significantly reduced, rendering our model
robust against poor data quality. Case studies have demonstrated that our model
generally has 2 to over 10-fold smaller average errors than other linear power
flow models, enjoys a satisfying accuracy against bad data, and facilitates a
faster solution to DPS analysis and optimization problems.

different density profiles. For each profile, we find the dependence of the
coherence length, $L_{coh}$, on neutrino energy and address the issue of
correspondence of results in the distance and energy-momentum representations.
The key new feature in matter is existence of energy ranges with enhanced
coherence around the energies $E_0$ of ""infinite coherence"" at which $L_{coh}
\rightarrow \infty$. In the configuration space, the infinite coherence
corresponds to equality of the (effective) group velocities of the eigenstates.
In constant density medium, there is a unique $E_0$, which coincides with the
MSW resonance energy of oscillations of mass states and is close to the MSW
resonance energy of flavor states. In the case of massless neutrinos or
negligible masses in a very dense medium the coherence persists continuously.
In the adiabatic case, the infinite coherence is realized for periodic density
change. Adiabaticity violation changes the shape factors of the wave packets
(WPs) and leads to their spread. In a medium with sharp density changes
(jumps), splitting of the eigenstates occurs at crossing of each jump. We study
the increase of the coherence length in a single jump and periodic density
jumps - castle-wall (CW) profiles. For the CW profile, there are several $E_0$
corresponding to parametric resonances. We outlined applications of the results
for supernova neutrinos. In particular, we show that coherence between two
shock wave fronts leads to observable oscillation effects, and our analysis
suggests that the decoherence can be irrelevant for flavor transformations in

techniques ever more refined, there has been an explosion in the quantity of
data acquired during routine light microcopy. At the single-molecule level,
analysis involves multiple steps and can rapidly become computationally
expensive, in some cases intractable on office workstations. Complex bespoke
software can present high activation barriers to entry for new users. Here, we
redevelop our quantitative single-molecule analysis routines into an optimized
and extensible Python program, with GUI and command-line implementations to
facilitate use on local machines and remote clusters, by beginners and advanced
users alike. We demonstrate that its performance is on par with previous MATLAB
implementations but runs an order of magnitude faster. We tested it against
challenge data and demonstrate its performance is comparable to
state-of-the-art analysis platforms. We show the code can extract fluorescence
intensity values for single reporter dye molecules and, using these, estimate
molecular stoichiometries and cellular copy numbers of fluorescently-labeled
biomolecules. It can evaluate 2D diffusion coefficients for the
characteristically short single-particle tracking data. To facilitate
benchmarking we include data simulation routines to compare different analysis
programs. Finally, we show that it works with 2-color data and enables
colocalization analysis based on overlap integration, to infer interactions
between differently labelled biomolecules. By making this freely available we
aim to make complex light microscopy single-molecule analysis more
democratized.

inevitably undergo secular evolution (`relaxation') causing their mean
distribution function (DF) to evolve on long timescales. On one hand, this
long-term evolution may be interpreted as driven by the accumulation of local
deflections along each star's mean field trajectory -- so-called `non-resonant
relaxation'. On the other hand, it can be thought of as driven by non-local,
collectively dressed and resonant couplings between stellar orbits, a process
termed `resonant relaxation'. In this paper we consider a model globular
cluster represented by a spherical, isotropic isochrone DF, and compare in
detail the predictions of both resonant and non-resonant relaxation theories
against tailored direct $N$-body simulations. In the space of orbital actions
(namely the radial action and total angular momentum), we find that both
resonant and non-resonant theories predict the correct morphology for the
secular evolution of the cluster's DF, although non-resonant theory
over-estimates the amplitude of the relaxation rate by a factor ${\sim 2}$. We
conclude that the secular relaxation of hot isotropic spherical clusters is not
dominated by collectively amplified large-scale potential fluctuations, despite
the existence of a strong ${\ell = 1}$ damped mode. Instead, collective
amplification affects relaxation only marginally even on the largest scales.
The predicted contributions to relaxation from smaller scale fluctuations are
essentially the same from resonant and non-resonant theories.

the vitality of our planet. Frogs and bees, for instance, may act like
biological sensors providing information about environmental changes. This task
is fundamental for ecological monitoring still includes many challenges such as
nonuniform signal length processing, degraded target signal due to
environmental noise, and the scarcity of the labeled samples for training
machine learning. To tackle these challenges, we present a bioacoustic signal
classifier equipped with a discriminative mechanism to extract useful features
for analysis and classification efficiently. The proposed classifier does not
require a large amount of training data and handles nonuniform signal length
natively. Unlike current bioacoustic recognition methods, which are
task-oriented, the proposed model relies on transforming the input signals into
vector subspaces generated by applying Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Then,
a subspace is designed to expose discriminative features. The proposed model
shares end-to-end capabilities, which is desirable in modern machine learning
systems. This formulation provides a segmentation-free and noise-tolerant
approach to represent and classify bioacoustic signals and a highly compact
signal descriptor inherited from SSA. The validity of the proposed method is
verified using three challenging bioacoustic datasets containing anuran, bee,
and mosquito species. Experimental results on three bioacoustic datasets have
shown the competitive performance of the proposed method compared to commonly
employed methods for bioacoustics signal classification in terms of accuracy.

  pre-print distribution",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate on
projects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research focuses on
activities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the code
brought to or created during a hackathon. Aim: We aim to understand the
evolution of hackathon-related code, specifically, how much hackathon teams
rely on pre-existing code or how much new code they develop during a hackathon.
Moreover, we aim to understand if and where that code gets reused. Method: We
collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects from DEVPOST -- a
hackathon database -- and obtained related code (blobs), authors, and project
characteristics from the World of Code. We investigated if code blobs in
hackathon projects were created before, during, or after an event by
identifying the original blob creation date and author, and also checked if the
original author was a hackathon project member. We tracked code reuse by first
identifying all commits containing blobs created during an event before
determining all projects that contain those commits. Result: While only
approximately 9.14% of the code blobs are created during hackathons, this
amount is still significant considering the time and member constraints of such
events. Approximately a third of these code blobs get reused in other projects.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates to what extent pre-existing code is used and
new code is created during a hackathon and how much of it is reused elsewhere
afterwards. Our findings help to better understand code reuse as a phenomenon
and the role of hackathons in this context and can serve as a starting point
for further studies in this area.

and was further studied by both graph theorists and linear algebraists. It is
based on the process of activating vertices of a graph $G$ starting from a set
of vertices that are already active, and applying the rule that an active
vertex with exactly one non-active neighbor forces that neighbor to become
active. A set $S\subset V(G)$ is called a zero forcing set of $G$ if initially
only vertices of $S$ are active and the described process enforces all vertices
of $G$ to become active. The size of a minimum zero forcing set in $G$ is
called the zero forcing number of $G$. While a minimum zero forcing set can
only be unique in edgeless graphs, we consider the weaker uniqueness condition,
notably that for every two minimum zero forcing sets in a graph $G$ there is an
automorphism that maps one to the other. We characterize the class of trees
that enjoy this condition by using properties of minimum path covers of trees.
In addition, we investigate both variations of uniqueness for several concepts
of Grundy domination, which first appeared in the context of domination games,
yet they are also closely related to zero forcing. For each of the four
variations of Grundy domination we characterize the graphs that have only one
Grundy dominating set of the given type, and characterize those forests that
enjoy the weaker (isomorphism based) condition of uniqueness. The latter
characterizations lead to efficient algorithms for recognizing the
corresponding classes of forests.

(gas+1-mm-dust) hydrodynamic simulations of circumstellar disks with embedded
planets (Neptune-, Saturn-, Jupiter-, 5 Jupiter-mass) at different orbital
distances from the star (5.2AU, 30AU, 50AU). We turn these simulations into
synthetic (sub-)millimeter ALMA images. We find that all but the Neptune-mass
planet open annular gaps in both the gas and the dust component of the disk. We
find that the temporal evolution of the dust density distribution is distinctly
different of the gas'. For example, the planets cause significant vertical
stirring of the dust in the circumstellar disk which opposes the vertical
settling. This creates a thicker dust disk than disks without a planet. We find
that this effect greatly influences the dust masses derived from the synthetic
ALMA images. Comparing the dust disk masses in the 3D simulations and the ones
derived from the 2D ALMA synthetic images, we find the former to be a factor of
a few (up to 10) larger, pointing to that real disks might be significantly
more massive than previously thought based on ALMA continuum images using the
optically thin assumption and equation. Finally, we analyze the synthetic ALMA
images and provide an empirical relationship between the planet mass and the

modelling approach, we construct a data-driven prior that is supported on a
sub-manifold of the ambient space, which we can learn from the training data by
using a variational autoencoder or a generative adversarial network. We
establish the existence and well-posedness of the associated posterior
distribution and posterior moments under easily verifiable conditions,
providing a rigorous underpinning for Bayesian estimators and uncertainty
quantification analyses. Bayesian computation is performed by using a parallel
tempered version of the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm on the
manifold, which is shown to be ergodic and robust to the non-convex nature of
these data-driven models. In addition to point estimators and uncertainty
quantification analyses, we derive a model misspecification test to
automatically detect situations where the data-driven prior is unreliable, and
explain how to identify the dimension of the latent space directly from the

consistent with Lorentz reciprocity, giving rise to symmetric sound
manipulation in space-time. To overcome this fundamental limitation and break
space-time symmetry, nonreciprocal sound steering is realized by designing and
experimentally implementing spatiotemporally-modulated acoustic metamaterials.
Relying on no slow mechanical parts, unstable and noisy airflow or complicated
piezoelectric array, our mechanism uses the coupling between an ultrathin
membrane and external electromagnetic field to realize programmable, dynamic
control of acoustic impedance in a motionless and noiseless manner. The fast
and flexible impedance modulation at the deeply subwavelength scale enabled by
our compact metamaterials provides an effective unidirectional momentum in
space-time to realize irreversible transition in k-{\omega} space between
different diffraction modes. The nonreciprocal wave-steering functionality of
the proposed metamaterial is elucidated by theoretically deriving the
time-varying acoustic response and demonstrated both numerically and
experimentally via two distinctive examples of unidirectional evanescent wave
conversion and nonreciprocal blue-shift focusing. This work can be further
extended into the paradigm of Bloch waves and impact other vibrant domains,
such as non-Hermitian topological acoustics and parity-time-symmetric
acoustics.

Here, we focus on yet another structural property, the chirality of the twisted

theory to investigate the properties induced by twist chirality in both real

chirality and atomic relaxation patterns. In momentum space, we investigate the
spin textures around the $K$ points of the Brillouin zone, showing that
alternating vortex-like textures are correlated with the chirality of tBLG.
Interestingly, the helicity of each vortex is inverted by changing the
chirality while the different twist angles also modify the spin textures. We
discuss the origin of the spin textures by calculating the layer weights and
using plot regression models.

damage of biological systems is crucial for the advancement of radiotherapy
with ion beams and for radiation protection in space. The study of ion-induced
biodamage using the phenomenon-based MultiScale Approach to the physics of
radiation damage with ions (MSA) has led to the prediction of nanoscale shock
waves (SW) that are created by ions in the biological medium at the high linear
energy transfer (LET). The high-LET regime corresponding to energy losses
higher than 1 keV/nm is typical for ions heavier than carbon in biological
media at the Bragg peak region. This paper reveals that the thermomechanical
stress of the DNA molecule by the ion-induced SW becomes the dominant mechanism
of complex DNA damage at the high-LET ion irradiation. Damage of the DNA
molecule in water caused by the ion-induced SW is studied by means of reactive
molecular dynamics simulations. Five projectile ions (C, O, Si, Ar, and Fe) at
the Bragg peak energies are considered. Simulations reveal that Ar and,
especially, Fe ions induce multiple bond breakages in a DNA segment containing
20 base pairs. The DNA damage produced in segments of such size leads to
complex irreparable lesions in a cell. This makes the SW-induced
thermomechanical stress the dominant mechanism of complex DNA damage at the
high-LET ion irradiation. A detailed theory for evaluating the DNA damage
caused by ions at high-LET is formulated and integrated into the MSA formalism.
The theoretical analysis reveals that a single ion hitting a cell nucleus at
high-LET is sufficient to produce highly complex, lethal damages to a cell by
the SW-induced thermomechanical stress. A good agreement of the calculated cell
survival probabilities with experimental data obtained for the cell irradiation
with iron ions provides strong experimental evidence of the ion-induced SW
effect.

polarization and spin diffusion length in this material were precisely

provide significant performance advantages against Doppler in high-mobility
scenarios. The core feature of OTFS is that the time-variant channel is
converted into a non-fading 2D channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain so that
all symbols experience the same channel gain. In now available literature, the
channel is assumed to be quasi-static over an OTFS frame. As for more practical
channels, the input-output relation will be time-variant as the environment or
medium changes. In this paper, we analyze the characterizations of OTFS
modulation over a more general multipath channel, where the signal of each path
has experienced a unique rapid fading. First, we derive the explicit
input-output relationship of OTFS in the DD domain for the case of ideal pulse
and rectangular pulse. It is shown that the rapid fading will produce extra
Doppler dispersion without impacting on delay domain. We next demonstrate that
OTFS can be interpreted as an efficient time diversity technology that combines
space-time encoding and interleaving. Simulation results reveal that OTFS is
insensitive to rapid fading and still outperforms orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) in these types of channels.

all paths have the same parity and at most one path has length 1,
$\text{ex}(n,\Theta_{k_1,\cdots,k_\ell})$ is $O(n^{1+1/k^\ast})$, where
$2k^\ast$ is the length of the smallest cycle in $\Theta_{k_1,\cdots,k_\ell}$.
We also establish matching lower bound in the particular case of
$\text{ex}(n,\Theta_{3,5,5})$.

  Performance: Why Using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient Matters""
  presented at EASE 2020",,,,"cs.SE cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Context: Software engineering researchers have undertaken many experiments
investigating the potential of software defect prediction algorithms.
Unfortunately, some widely used performance metrics are known to be
problematic, most notably F1, but nevertheless F1 is widely used.
  Objective: To investigate the potential impact of using F1 on the validity of
this large body of research.
  Method: We undertook a systematic review to locate relevant experiments and
then extract all pairwise comparisons of defect prediction performance using F1
and the un-biased Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).
  Results: We found a total of 38 primary studies. These contain 12,471 pairs
of results. Of these, 21.95% changed direction when the MCC metric is used
instead of the biased F1 metric. Unfortunately, we also found evidence
suggesting that F1 remains widely used in software defect prediction research.
  Conclusions: We reiterate the concerns of statisticians that the F1 is a
problematic metric outside of an information retrieval context, since we are
concerned about both classes (defect-prone and not defect-prone units). This
inappropriate usage has led to a substantial number (more than one fifth) of
erroneous (in terms of direction) results. Therefore we urge researchers to (i)
use an unbiased metric and (ii) publish detailed results including confusion
matrices such that alternative analyses become possible.

among $4f$-electrons. That is, an intrinsic pinning happens originating in an
anomalously enhanced magnetic anisotropy energy contributed by an order of
magnitude stronger charge-transfer process between $4f$-electrons and
$3d$-electrons, than the conventional crystal field effects. It is demonstrated
that the $4f$-$3d$ charge-transfer process depends on the direction of

simulation of composite microstructures. It utilizes the earlier introduced MOR
technique (Kochmann et al. [2019]), which is based on solving the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation in Fourier space by a reduced set of frequencies.
Crucial for the accuracy of this MOR technique is on the one hand the amount of
used frequencies and on the other hand the choice of frequencies used within
the simulation. Kochmann et al. [2019] defined the reduced set of frequencies
by using a fixed sampling pattern, which is most general but leads to poor
microstructural results when considering only a few frequencies. Consequently,
a reconstruction algorithm based on the TV1-algorithm [Candes et al., 2006] was
used in a post-processing step to generate highly resolved micromechanical
fields. The present work deals with a modified sampling pattern generation for
this MOR technique. Based on the idea, that the micromechanical material
response strongly depends on the phase-wise material behavior, we propose the
usage of sampling patterns adapted to the spatial arrangement of the individual
phases. This leads to significantly improved microscopic and overall results.
Hence, the time-consuming reconstruction in the post-processing step that was
necessary in the earlier work is no longer required. To show the adaptability
and robustness of this new choice of sampling patterns, several two dimensional
examples are investigated. In addition, also the 3D extension of the algorithm
is presented.

lot of applications in vision and graphics. Previous works treat this task as
sequence generation, however, it is challenging to render a music-aligned
long-term sequence with high kinematic complexity and coherent movements. In
this paper, we reformulate it by a two-stage process, ie, a key pose generation
and then an in-between parametric motion curve prediction, where the key poses
are easier to be synchronized with the music beats and the parametric curves
can be efficiently regressed to render fluent rhythm-aligned movements. We
named the proposed method as DanceFormer, which includes two cascading
kinematics-enhanced transformer-guided networks (called DanTrans) that tackle
each stage, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale music
conditioned 3D dance dataset, called PhantomDance, that is accurately labeled
by experienced animators rather than reconstruction or motion capture. This
dataset also encodes dances as key poses and parametric motion curves apart
from pose sequences, thus benefiting the training of our DanceFormer. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, even trained by existing
datasets, can generate fluent, performative, and music-matched 3D dances that
surpass previous works quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, the proposed
DanceFormer, together with the PhantomDance dataset, are seamlessly compatible
with industrial animation software, thus facilitating the adaptation for
various downstream applications.

from McLerran and Reddy. This extension allows us to construct the

quarkyonic matter originates from the large number of color limit for which
nucleons are the correct degrees of freedom near the Fermi surface --
reflecting the confining forces -- while deep inside the Fermi sea quarks
naturally appear. In isospin asymmetric matter, we suggest that this new
concept can be implemented within a global isoscalar relation between the shell
gaps differentiating the nucleon and the quark sectors. In addition, we impose
the conservation of the isospin-flavor asymmetry in the nucleon and the quark
phases. Within this model, several quarkyonic stars are constructed on top of
the SLy4 model for the nucleon sector, producing a bump in the sound speed,
which implies that quarkyonic stars are systematically bigger and have a larger
maximum mass than the associated neutron stars. They also predict lower proton
fraction at $\beta$-equilibrium, which potentially quenches fast cooling in
massive compact stars.

technologies, imitation learning-based path planning approaches have achieved
effective results in recent years. However, the disadvantages of these
approaches are twofold: 1) they may need extensive time and labor to record
expert demonstrations as training data; and 2) existing approaches could only
receive high-level commands, such as turning left/right. These commands could
be less sufficient for the navigation of mobile robots (e.g., robotic
wheelchairs), which usually require exact poses of goals. We contribute a
solution to this problem by proposing S2P2, a self-supervised goal-directed
path planning approach. Specifically, we develop a pipeline to automatically
generate planned path labels given as input RGB-D images and poses of goals.
Then, we present a best-fit regression plane loss to train our data-driven path
planning model based on the generated labels. Our S2P2 does not need pre-built
maps, but it can be integrated into existing map-based navigation systems
through our framework. Experimental results show that our S2P2 outperforms
traditional path planning algorithms, and increases the robustness of existing

learning depends strongly on the type of data augmentations used in the

to videos and found that leveraging both audio and video signals yields strong
gains; however, they did not find that spatial augmentations such as cropping,
which are very important for still images, work as well for videos. In this
paper, we improve these formulations in two ways unique to the spatio-temporal
aspect of videos. First, for space, we show that spatial augmentations such as
cropping do work well for videos too, but that previous implementations, due to
the high processing and memory cost, could not do this at a scale sufficient
for it to work well. To address this issue, we first introduce Feature Crop, a
method to simulate such augmentations much more efficiently directly in feature
space. Second, we show that as opposed to naive average pooling, the use of
transformer-based attention improves performance significantly, and is well
suited for processing feature crops. Combining both of our discoveries into a
new method, Space-Time Crop & Attend (STiCA) we achieve state-of-the-art

attack graphs, making it possible to quantitatively analyse the security of
large networks. In the event of an attack, probabilities on the graph change
depending on the evidence discovered (e.g., by an intrusion detection system or

through direct computation, we discuss and compare three stochastic simulation
techniques for updating the probabilities dynamically based on the evidence and
compare their speed and accuracy. From our experiments we conclude that
likelihood weighting is most efficient for most uses. We also consider
sensitivity analysis of BAGs, to identify the most critical nodes for
protection of the network and solve the uncertainty problem in the assignment

to carefully consider the state of matter in their interior. The outer

The presence of superfluidity brings new degrees of freedom -- in essence we

rotation is supported by a dense array of quantised vortices, which introduce
dissipation via mutual friction, and the motion of the superfluid is affected

-- a multi-component system with identifiable relative flows -- and outlines a
set of models for scenarios relevant for different astronomical observation
channels. The specific problems used to illustrate the key principles include
superfluid hydrodynamics (with relevance for radio and x-ray pulsar timing and
gravitational-wave searches), heat flow (connecting to the problem of neutron
star cooling and associated x-ray observations) and the coupling between matter
and electromagnetism (linking to explosive phenomena like gamma-ray bursts and
more subtle issues like the long-term evolution of a neutron star's magnetic
field). We also comment on the coupling between matter and radiation, for which
the multifluid approach would seem less appropriate. The main motivation of the
survey is to illustrate less familiar aspects that come into play in multifluid
problems, establish the relevant ""language"" and provide a platform for more
detailed work on these issues.

source for understanding the dispersal, break down, and biotic impacts of the
microplastics in the ocean. The observed size distribution at the sea surface
generally shows, from large to small sizes, a gradual increase followed by a
rapid decrease. This decrease has led to the hypothesis that the smallest
fragments are selectively removed by sinking or biological uptake. Here we
propose a new model of size distribution without any removal of material from
the system. The model uses an analogy with black-body radiation and the
resultant size distribution is analogous to Planck's law. In this model, the
original large plastic piece is broken into smaller pieces once by the
application of ""energy"" or work by waves or other processes, under two
assumptions, one that fragmentation into smaller pieces requires larger energy
and the other that the probability distribution of the ""energy"" follows the
Boltzmann distribution. Our formula well reproduces observed size distributions
over wide size ranges from micro- to mesoplastics. According to this model, the
smallest fragments are fewer because large ""energy"" required to produce such
small fragments occurs more rarely.

present optically reconfigurable quasi-phase-matching in large radius
Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators resulting in mW level on-chip second-harmonic

occur unconstrained from intermodal phase-matching, leading to widely tunable
second-harmonic generation. We confirm the phenomenon by two-photon imaging of
the inscribed $\chi^{(2)}$ grating structures within the microresonators as
well as by dynamic tracking of both the pump and second-harmonic mode

constraints even in resonant systems, and simultaneously allow for the combined

within the research community given the importance of deploying more reliable
machine-learning systems. In computer vision applications, generative
counterfactual methods indicate how to perturb a model's input to change its
prediction, providing details about the model's decision-making. Current
methods tend to generate trivial counterfactuals about a model's decisions, as
they often suggest to exaggerate or remove the presence of the attribute being
classified. For the machine learning practitioner, these types of
counterfactuals offer little value, since they provide no new information about
undesired model or data biases. In this work, we identify the problem of
trivial counterfactual generation and we propose DiVE to alleviate it. DiVE
learns a perturbation in a disentangled latent space that is constrained using
a diversity-enforcing loss to uncover multiple valuable explanations about the
model's prediction. Further, we introduce a mechanism to prevent the model from
producing trivial explanations. Experiments on CelebA and Synbols demonstrate
that our model improves the success rate of producing high-quality valuable
explanations when compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Code is

machine learning tasks, and an intelligent self-learning system should be able
to distinguish between known and unknown examples. Accordingly, open set
recognition (OSR), which addresses the problem of classifying knowns and
identifying unknowns, has recently been highlighted. However, conventional deep
neural networks using a softmax layer are vulnerable to overgeneralization,
producing high confidence scores for unknowns. In this paper, we propose a
simple OSR method based on the intuition that OSR performance can be maximized
by setting strict and sophisticated decision boundaries that reject unknowns
while maintaining satisfactory classification performance on knowns. For this
purpose, a novel network structure is proposed, in which multiple one-vs-rest
networks (OVRNs) follow a convolutional neural network feature extractor. Here,
the OVRN is a simple feed-forward neural network that enhances the ability to
reject nonmatches by learning class-specific discriminative features.
Furthermore, the collective decision score is modeled by combining the multiple
decisions reached by the OVRNs to alleviate overgeneralization. Extensive
experiments were conducted on various datasets, and the experimental results
showed that the proposed method performed significantly better than the
state-of-the-art methods by effectively reducing overgeneralization.

noise discrepancy). In this paper, we present an unpaired learning scheme to
adapt a color image denoiser for handling test images with noise discrepancy.
We consider a practical training setting, i.e., a pre-trained denoiser, a set
of test noisy images, and an unpaired set of clean images. To begin with, the
pre-trained denoiser is used to generate the pseudo clean images for the test
images. Pseudo-ISP is then suggested to jointly learn the pseudo ISP pipeline

clean color images to synthesize realistic noisy images for denoiser adaption.
Pseudo-ISP is effective in synthesizing realistic noisy sRGB images, and
improved denoising performance can be achieved by alternating between
Pseudo-ISP training and denoiser adaption. Experiments show that our Pseudo-ISP

established excellent open-source packages to efficiently simulate large
systems over long time scales -- a crucial consideration given the separation
in time- and length-scales often observed in soft matter. What happens, though,
when we think more broadly about what it means to construct a neighbor list?
What if interactions are non-reciprocal, or if the ""range"" of an interaction is
determined not by a distance scale but according to some other consideration?
As the field of soft and active matter increasingly considers the properties of
living matter -- from the cellular to the super-organismal scale -- these
questions become increasingly relevant, and encourage us to think about new
physical and computational paradigms in the modeling of active matter. In this
chapter we examine case studies in the use of non-metric interactions.

a network with ubiquitous connections, such as the Internet of Things (IoT)

GF-SCMA, we first develop a theoretical model taking into account the property
of multi-user detection (MUD) in the SCMA system. We then analyze the error
rate performance of GF-SCMA in the case of codebook collision to investigate
the reliability of GF-SCMA when reusing codebook in massive IoT networks. For
performance evaluation, accurate approximations for both success probability
and average symbol error probability (ASEP) are derived. To elaborate further,
we utilize the analytical results to discuss the impact of codeword sparse
degree in GFSCMA. After that, we conduct a comparative study between SCMA and
its variant, dense code multiple access (DCMA), with GF transmission to offer
insights into the effectiveness of these two schemes. This facilitates the
GF-SCMA system design in practical implementation. Simulation results show that
denser codebooks can help to support more UEs and increase the reliability of
data transmission in a GF-SCMA network. Moreover, a higher success probability
can be achieved by GFSCMA with denser UE deployment at low detection thresholds
since SCMA can achieve overloading gain.

problem as it lays the foundation of probing magnetic fields with polarized
dust thermal emissions. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of
magnetic alignment in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). We use an alignment
condition that Larmor precession should be fast compared with the damping
timescale. We first show that the Larmor precession timescale is some three
orders of magnitude longer than the damping time for millimeter-sized grains
under conditions typical of PPDs, making the magnetic alignment unlikely. The
precession time can be shortened by superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs), but
the reduction factor strongly depends on the size of the SPI clusters, which we
find is limited by the so-called ""N\'{e}el's relaxation process."" In
particular, the size limit of SPIs is set by the so-called ""anisotropic energy
constant"" of the SPI material, which describes the energy barrier needed to
change the direction of the magnetic moment of an SPI. For the most common
iron-bearing materials, we find maximum SPI sizes corresponding to a reduction
factor of the Larmor precession timescale of order $10^3$. We also find that
reaching this maximum reduction factor requires fine-tuning on the SPI sizes.
Lastly, we illustrate the effects of the SPI size limits on magnetic alignment
of dust grains with a simple disk model, and we conclude that it is unlikely
for relatively large grains of order 100 $\mu$m or more to be aligned with
magnetic fields even with SPIs.

high nonlinearity, it is important to consider the effects of higher-order
nonlinearities. We observe that the quintic nonlinearity (QN) increases the MI
for cooperating nonlinearities while it suppresses the MI for competing
nonlinearities. We have also importantly studied the effect of QN on the MI

crucial stage in galaxy life. Two mechanisms for quenching are possible: halo
mass quenching of central galaxies and environmental quenching of satellite
galaxies. This thesis describes the satellite galaxies (SG) quenching process
and its primary causes. The analysis contains a study of a large sample of 118
SGs within the Vela cosmological simulation, identified by a specific SG merger
tree algorithm.
  We find that the quenching evolves through a typical path in the diagram of
specific star formation (sSFR) vs. inner stellar surface density
($\Sigma_{\star, 0.5\textrm kpc}$), with the inner surface density defined as
the density within 0.5kpc from the center of mass of the SG. Three discrete
phases characterize this path: 1. Halt in gas accretion with SG compaction at
high sSFR as the SG keeps forming stars 2. Gas removal and rapid drop in the
sSFR at the peri-center of its orbit within the host halo 3. Stellar heating
and stripping may lead to coalescing with the halo center, an ultra-diffuse
galaxy (UDG), a compact elliptical galaxy (eCg), or a globular cluster (GC).
  We find that the main drivers of SG evolution are ram pressure stripping at
the initial stages and tidal forces at the final stages, aided by starvation,
suppression of gas accretion. We show that other processes, such as gas
depletion by star formation or stellar feedback are secondary.
  Moreover, we present an innovative method for constructing merger trees in
simulations that solve systemic errors. Two new significant results presented

boundary (e.g. tides) or the rotation vector (e.g. in direction by precession,
or in magnitude by longitudinal librations). Using boundary-layer theory, we
determine the mean zonal flows generated by nonlinear interactions within the
viscous Ekman layer. These flows are of interest because they survive in the
relevant planetary regime of both vanishing forcings and viscous effects. We
extend the theory to take into account (i) the combination of spatial and
temporal perturbations, providing new mechanically driven zonal flows (e.g.
driven by latitudinal librations), and (ii) the spheroidal geometry relevant
for planetary bodies. Wherever possible, our analytical predictions are
validated with direct numerical simulations. The theoretical solutions are in
good quantitative agreement with the simulations, with expected discrepancies
(zonal jets) in the presence of inertial waves generated at the critical
latitudes (as for precession). Moreover, we find that the mean zonal flows can
be strongly affected in spheroids. Guided by planetary applications, we also
revisit the scaling laws for the geostrophic shear layers at the critical
latitudes, and the influence of a solid inner core.

the ULX. Spectral properties of the ULX suggest that the source is in a
broadened disk state with luminosities ($\approx (3-10) \times 10^{39}$ ergs
s$^{-1}$) falling in the ultraluminous regime. The positive
Luminosity-temperature relation further suggests that the multi color disk

decades, only as of 2010 research has focused on exploiting the same discovered
symmetry dynamically, during the run of the SAT solver, by learning extra
clauses. The two methods are distinct and not compatible. The former prunes
solutions, whereas the latter does not -- it only prunes areas of the search
that do not have solutions, like standard conflict clauses. Both approaches,
however, require what we call \emph{full symmetry}, namely a
propositionally-consistent mapping $\sigma$ between the literals, such that
$\sigma(\varphi) \equiv \varphi$, where here $\equiv$ means syntactic
equivalence modulo clause ordering and literal ordering within the clauses. In
this article we show that such full symmetry is not a necessary condition for
adding extra clauses: isomorphism between possibly-overlapping subgraphs of the
colored incidence graph is sufficient. While finding such subgraphs is a
computationally hard problem, there are many cases in which they can be
detected a priory by analyzing the high-level structure of the problem from
which the CNF was derived. We demonstrate this principle with several
well-known problems, including Van der Waerden numbers, bounded model checking
and Boolean Pythagorean triples.

electronic excitations in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x have been studied by Electron
Energy-Loss Spectroscopy in reflection (R-EELS) in the strange metal range
between underdoped and overdoped materials. The authors conclude that there are
no well defined plasmons. Rather they obtain a momentum-independent continuum
which they discuss in terms of holographic theories. In this Comment it is
pointed out that the experimental results are in stark contrast to previous
EELS in transmission (T-EELS), Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS), and
optical studies. The differences can be probably explained by an inaccurate
momentum scale in the R-EELS experiments. Furthermore, it is shown, that many
material specific experimental results from T-EELS, R-EELS, RIXS, and optical
spectroscopy can be explained by a more traditional extended Lindhard model.
This model describes the energy, the width, and the dispersion of normal and
acoustic plasmons in cuprates, as well as the continuum. The latter is
explained by electron-hole excitations inside a lifetime broadened conduction
band. This continuum is directly related to the scattering rates of the charge
carriers, which in turn, by a feed back process, lead to the continuum.

machine learning models that are able to perform well on a collection of

the worst-case distribution, allowing for more flexible and problem-specific

approach poses a number of implementation and optimization challenges. To
circumvent these issues, we propose a relaxation of the KL-constrained inner

and explained in detail. This paper proposes a formation control method for
multiple Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) on multi-lane roads. Firstly,
a bi-level planning framework is proposed to switch the structure of the
formation in different scenarios smoothly and effectively. Secondly, the
relative coordinate system is established and the conflict-free relative paths
are planned in the upper level. Then, multi-stage trajectory planning and
tracking are modeled and solved as an optimal control problem with path
constraints in the lower level. Next, case study is conducted to verify the
function of the proposed method in different scenarios. Finally, simulation in
the lane-drop bottleneck scenario is carried out under different traffic volume
and numerical results indicate that the proposed method can improve both
traffic efficiency and fuel economy at high traffic volume.

(WMP, for short) if for every bounded linear operator $T$ from $E$ into $F$,
the existence of a non-weakly null maximizing sequence for $T$ implies that $T$
attains its norm. This property was recently introduced in an article by R.
Aron, D. Garc\'ia, D. Pelegrino and E. Teixeira, raising several open
questions. The aim of the present paper is to contribute to the better
knowledge of the WMP and its limitations. Namely, we provide sufficient
conditions for a pair of Banach spaces to fail the WMP and study the behaviour
of this property with respect to quotients, subspaces, and direct sums, which
open the gate to present several consequences. For instance, we deal with pairs
of the form $(L_p[0,1], L_q[0,1])$, proving that these pairs fail the WMP
whenever $p>2$ or $q<2$. We also show that, under certain conditions on $E$,
the assumption that $(E, F)$ has the WMP for every Banach space $F$ implies
that $E$ must be finite dimensional. On the other hand, we show that $(E, F)$
has the WMP for every reflexive space $E$ if and only if $F$ has the Schur
property. We also give a complete characterization for the pairs $(\ell_s
\oplus_p \ell_p, \ell_s \oplus_q \ell_q)$ to have the WMP by calculating the
moduli of asymptotic uniform convexity of $\ell_s \oplus_p \ell_p$ and of
asymptotic uniform smoothness of $\ell_s \oplus_q \ell_q$ when $1 < p \leq s
\leq q < \infty$. We conclude the paper by discussing some variants of the WMP
and presenting a list of open problems on the topic of the paper.

vehicles. Current mainstream methods, such as functionality decomposition and
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL), either suffer high time complexity or
poor interpretability and adaptability on real-world autonomous driving tasks.
In this paper, we present an interpretable and computationally efficient
framework called integrated decision and control (IDC) for automated vehicles,
which decomposes the driving task into static path planning and dynamic optimal
tracking that are structured hierarchically. First, the static path planning
generates several candidate paths only considering static traffic elements.
Then, the dynamic optimal tracking is designed to track the optimal path while
considering the dynamic obstacles. To that end, we formulate a constrained
optimal control problem (OCP) for each candidate path, optimize them separately
and follow the one with the best tracking performance. To unload the heavy
online computation, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm that can be served as an approximate constrained OCP solver.
Specifically, the OCPs for all paths are considered together to construct a
single complete RL problem and then solved offline in the form of value and
policy networks, for real-time online path selecting and tracking respectively.
We verify our framework in both simulations and the real world. Results show
that compared with baseline methods IDC has an order of magnitude higher online
computing efficiency, as well as better driving performance including traffic
efficiency and safety. In addition, it yields great interpretability and
adaptability among different driving tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is also demonstrated in real road tests with complicated traffic

MIP research focuses on designing effective heuristics, the question of how to
manage multiple MIP heuristics in a solver has not received equal attention.
Generally, solvers follow hard-coded rules derived from empirical testing on
broad sets of instances. Since the performance of heuristics is
instance-dependent, using these general rules for a particular problem might
not yield the best performance. In this work, we propose the first data-driven
framework for scheduling heuristics in an exact MIP solver. By learning from
data describing the performance of primal heuristics, we obtain a
problem-specific schedule of heuristics that collectively find many solutions
at minimal cost. We provide a formal description of the problem and propose an
efficient algorithm for computing such a schedule. Compared to the default

sufficiently warm the early martian surface to allow the formation of valley

the early martian climate that we have performed assuming dense CO2+H2
atmospheres. Our climate model, derived from earlier works by Forget et al.
(2013) and Wordsworth et al. (2013), is coupled to an asynchronous model of the
long-term evolution of martian glaciers and lakes. Simulations were carried out
at 40{\deg} obliquity to investigate how (i) water content and (ii) H2 content
(added to 1 or 2 bars of CO2) can shape the climate and hydrologic cycle of
early Mars. We show that the adiabatic cooling mechanism (Wordsworth et al.
2013) that leads to the accumulation of ice deposits in the southern highlands
in cold climate (the so called 'icy highland scenario') also works in warm
climates, with impact crater lakes acting as the main water reservoirs. This
produces rainfall mainly localized in the southern highlands of Mars. If one
adjust (i) the amount of CO2 and H2, (ii) the size and location of the water
reservoirs, and (iii) the ancient topography (i.e. by removing Tharsis), the
spatial patterns of surface runoff (from rainfall or snowmelt) in the
simulations can match -- with a few exceptions -- the observed distribution of
valley networks and impact crater lakes. Although our results are obtained for
CO2-dominated atmospheres enriched with H2, they should also apply to assess
the impact of any combination of powerful long-lived greenhouse gases on early
Mars.

host star luminosities and the planets' small orbital separations

and therefore occupy a region of parameter space in which planetary inflation
mechanisms become effective. Comparison with statistical studies and a
consideration of the planets' high incident fluxes reveals that NGTS-16b,
NGTS-17b, and NGTS-18b are indeed likely inflated, although some disparities
arise upon analysis with current Bayesian inflationary models. However, the
underlying relationships which govern radius inflation remain poorly
understood. We postulate that the inclusion of additional hyperparameters to
describe latent factors such as heavy element fraction, as well as the addition
of an updated catalogue of hot Jupiters, would refine inflationary models, thus
furthering our understanding of the physical processes which give rise to
inflated planets.

regions by reconstructing the 3D colonoscopic surface from colonoscopy videos
in real-time. However, the lighting inconsistency of colonoscopy videos can
cause a key component of the colonoscopic reconstruction system, the SLAM
optimization, to fail. In this work we focus on the lighting problem in
colonoscopy videos. To successfully improve the lighting consistency of
colonoscopy videos, we have found necessary a lighting correction that adapts
to the intensity distribution of recent video frames. To achieve this in
real-time, we have designed and trained an RNN network. This network adapts the
gamma value in a gamma-correction process. Applied in the colonoscopic surface
reconstruction system, our light-weight model significantly boosts the
reconstruction success rate, making a larger proportion of colonoscopy video
segments reconstructable and improving the reconstruction quality of the
already reconstructed segments.

absorption by the NPG sheet and the resulting phase change of VO$_2$ from

Fixed Eq 9",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) requires precise time-of-flight measurements
of the transmitted/received waveform to produce well-focused imagery. It is not
uncommon for errors in these measurements to be present resulting in image
defocusing. To overcome this, an \emph{autofocus} algorithm is employed as a
post-processing step after image reconstruction to improve image focus. A
particular class of these algorithms can be framed as a sharpness/contrast
metric-based optimization. To improve convergence, a hand-crafted weighting
function to remove ""bad"" areas of the image is sometimes applied to the
image-under-test before the optimization procedure. Additionally, dozens of
iterations are necessary for convergence which is a large compute burden for
low size, weight, and power (SWaP) systems. We propose a deep learning
technique to overcome these limitations and implicitly learn the weighting
function in a data-driven manner. Our proposed method, which we call Deep
Autofocus, uses features from the single-look-complex (SLC) to estimate the
phase correction which is applied in $k$-space. Furthermore, we train our
algorithm on batches of training imagery so that during deployment, only a
single iteration of our method is sufficient to autofocus. We show results
demonstrating the robustness of our technique by comparing our results to four
commonly used image sharpness metrics. Our results demonstrate Deep Autofocus
can produce imagery perceptually better than common iterative techniques but at
a lower computational cost. We conclude that Deep Autofocus can provide a more
favorable cost-quality trade-off than alternatives with significant potential
of future research.

science alert in 2017. We carried out optical and near-infrared photometric,
and optical spectroscopic observations to understand the light variations. The
light curves show that V555 Ori was faint before 2017, entered a high state for
about a year, and returned to the faint state by mid-2018. In addition to the
long-term flux evolution, quasi-periodic brightness oscillations were also
evident, with a period of about 5 days. At optical wavelengths both the
long-term and short-term variations exhibited colourless changes, while in the
near-infrared they were consistent with changing extinction. We explain the
brightness variations as the consequence of changing extinction. The object has
a low accretion rate whose variation in itself would not be enough to reproduce
the optical flux changes. This behaviour makes V555 Ori similar to the pre-main
sequence star AA Tau, where the light changes are interpreted as periodic
eclipses of the star by a rotating inner disc warp. The brightness maximum of
V555 Ori was a moderately obscured ($A_V$=2.3 mag) state, while the extinction
in the low state was $A_V$=6.4 mag. We found that while the Gaia alert hinted
at an accretion burst, V555 Ori is a standard dipper, similar to the prototype
AA Tau. However, unlike in AA Tau, the periodic behaviour was also detectable
in the faint phase, implying that the inner disc warp remained stable in both
the high and low states of the system.

path planning of multi-robot systems (MRS) in obstacle-ridden environments. A
new formation potential fields (FPF) concept is proposed around a virtual
agent, located at the center of the formation which ensures self-organization
and maintenance of the formation. The path of the virtual agent is centrally
planned and the robots at the minima of the FPF are forced to move along with
the virtual agent. In the neighborhood of obstacles, individual robots
selfishly avoid collisions, thus marginally deviating from the formation. The
proposed quasi-centralized approach introduces formation flexibility into the
MRS, which enables MRS to effectively navigate in an obstacle-ridden workspace.
Methodical analysis of the proposed approach and guidelines for selecting the
FPF are presented. Results using a candidate FPF are shown that ensure a
pentagonal formation effectively squeezes through a narrow passage avoiding any

between the received signal and the target impulse response (TIR); the other is
to minimize the minimum mean-square error for estimating the TIR. In addition,
practical constraints on the waveforms are considered, including an energy

lies in the introduction of a hyperparameterized method for down-selecting the

using automated algorithm configuration. We tune this method for black box

magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a coronal EUV wave and the
accompanying quasi-periodic wave trains. The numerical experiment is conducted
with the MURaM code and simulates the formation of solar active regions through
magnetic flux emergence from the convection zone to the corona. The coronal EUV
wave is driven by the eruption of a magnetic flux rope that also gives rise to
a C-class flare. It propagates in a semi-circular shape with an initial speed
ranging from about 550 to 700 km s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to an average Mach
number (relative to fast magnetoacoustic waves) of about 1.2. Furthermore, the
abrupt increase of the plasma density, pressure and tangential magnetic field
at the wavefront confirms fast-mode shock nature of the coronal EUV wave.
Quasi-periodic wave trains with a period of about 30 s are found as multiple
secondary wavefronts propagating behind the leading wavefront and ahead of the
erupting magnetic flux rope. We also note that the true wavefront in the 3D
space can be very inhomogeneous, however, the line-of-sight integration of EUV
emission significantly smoothes the sharp structures in 3D and leads to a more
diffuse wavefront.

sharper than those produced with unconditional tail distributions. In a
use-case inspired evaluation exercise based on reserve setting, the conditional
tails are shown to reduce the overall volume of reserve required to manage a

other methods. The proposed method therefore enables user to both reduce costs

a common tool used to create maps of parts of the surface of the Earth or other

inspections of buildings in military and civilian services. Nowadays, any SAR
imaging software is based on the Born approximation, which is a linearization
of the original wave-like partial differential equation. One of the essential
assumptions this linearization procedure needs is that only those dielectric
constants are imaged whose values are close to the constant background. In this
work, we propose a radically new idea: to work without any linearization while
still using the same data as the conventional SAR imaging technique uses. We
construct a 2D image of the dielectric constant function using a number of 1D
images of this function obtained via solving a 1D coefficient inverse problem
(CIP) for a hyperbolic equation. Different from our previous studies on the
convexification method with concentration on the global convergence of the
gradient projection method, this time we prove the global convergence of the
gradient descent method, which is easier to implement numerically.

candidate edits, where the GNN is trained on-the-fly with samples from MCMC.
Experiments show that MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance in various

where all four objectives are simultaneously optimized, our approach
outperforms previous methods significantly in comprehensive evaluations. The

Despite years of effort in analysing patterns of species co-occurrences and the

sufficiently harnessed in current statistical models, notably the knowledge on
interspecific interactions. Here, we develop ELGRIN, a statistical model that
simultaneously combines knowledge on interspecific interactions (i.e., the
metanetwork), environmental data and species occurrences to tease apart their
relative effects on species distributions. Instead of focusing on single
effects of pairwise species interactions, which have little sense in complex
communities, ELGRIN contrasts the overall effect of species interactions to
that of the environment. Using various simulated and empirical data, we
demonstrate the suitability of ELGRIN to address the objectives for various
types of interspecific interactions like mutualism, competition and trophic
interactions. We then apply the model on vertebrate trophic networks in the
European Alps to map the effect of biotic interactions on species
distributions.Data on ecological networks are everyday increasing and we
believe the time is ripe to mobilize these data to better understand
biodiversity patterns. ELGRIN provides this opportunity to unravel how

literature for the last decade. Though it has been shown to be surpassed
numerous times by alternative algorithms in terms of PSNR, the margins are very
thin, and denoising is approaching a limiting point. The reason for the
continued use of BM3D within the literature is due to its off-the-shelf
ease-of-use in any application, which alternative improved denoising algorithms
sometimes fail to match. This article proposes a new variation of BM3D, which
maintains its ease of use but is notably faster. This development brings us
closer to real-time ease-of-use application of new state-of-the-art image
reconstruction algorithms such as plug-and-play priors.

Though our algorithm is written completely in MATLAB software, it is already
between 5-20 times faster than the original algorithm, and the modifications to
the algorithm are such that it is expected to be significantly faster when
ported to CUDA language and with more powerful GPUs. The improved processing
time is achieved by two main components. The first component is a new
computational strategy that achieves faster block matching, and the second is a
new global approach to the 3D wavelet filtering step that allows for
significantly improved processing times on GPUs. The fast block matching

features of Evo-SETI are: 1) The Statistical Drake Equation is the extension of
the classical Drake equation into Statistics. Probability distributions of the
number of ET civilizations in the Galaxy are given, and so is the probable
distribution of the distance of ETs from us. 2) Darwinian Evolution is
re-defined as a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) in the number of living species
on Earth over the last 3.5 billion years. Its mean value grows exponentially in
time and Mass Extinctions of the past are accounted for as unpredictable low
GBM values. 3) The exponential growth of the number of species during Evolution
is the geometric locus of the peaks of a one-parameter family of lognormal
distributions constrained between the time axis and the exponential mean value.
This accounts for cladistics. 4) The lifespan of a living being, let it be a
cell, an animal, a human, a historic human society, or even an ET society, is
mathematically described as a finite b-lognormal. This author then described
mathematically the historical development of eight human historic
civilizations, from Ancient Greece to the USA, by virtue of b-lognormals. 5)
The b-lognormal's entropy is the measure of a civilization's advancement level.
By measuring the entropy difference between Aztecs and Spaniards in 1519, this

few thousand Spaniards, due to the latter's technological superiority. Now:
whenever a new exoplanet is discovered, where does that exoplanet stand in its
evolution towards life as we have it on Earth nowadays, or beyond? In this

is relevant to diagnose progress in the knowledge of the equation of state of
neutron matter, by quantifying the maximum possible (presumed) phase transition
that its error bands would allow. Thus, latent heat is a natural benchmark for
the equation of state in cold QCD.

robustness guarantees against adversarial attacks for deep classifiers. Prior
works on randomized smoothing against L_1 adversarial attacks use additive
smoothing noise and provide probabilistic robustness guarantees. In this work,
we propose a non-additive and deterministic smoothing method, Deterministic
Smoothing with Splitting Noise (DSSN). To develop DSSN, we first develop SSN, a
randomized method which involves generating each noisy smoothing sample by
first randomly splitting the input space and then returning a representation of
the center of the subdivision occupied by the input sample. In contrast to
uniform additive smoothing, the SSN certification does not require the random
noise components used to be independent. Thus, smoothing can be done
effectively in just one dimension and can therefore be efficiently derandomized
for quantized data (e.g., images). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to provide deterministic ""randomized smoothing"" for a norm-based
adversarial threat model while allowing for an arbitrary classifier (i.e., a
deep model) to be used as a base classifier and without requiring an
exponential number of smoothing samples. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we
provide substantially larger L_1 robustness certificates compared to prior
works, establishing a new state-of-the-art. The determinism of our method also
leads to significantly faster certificate computation. Code is available at:

appealing effects on the cosmic expansion history. We investigate this premise
by including a canonical SU(2) Yang- Mills field to the total energy budget of
the universe coupled to the standard quintessential field by a disformal
transformation. From the dynamical system analysis, we study three cases of
cosmological interest that span most of the physical phase space of the model:
the uncoupled limit, the isotropic, and the Abelian cases. New scaling
solutions with a non-vanishing gauge field are found in all cases which can be
interesting for early cosmological scenarios. Some of these scaling solutions
even exhibit anisotropic features. Also, the background evolution of the
universe is studied by means of numerical analysis. As an interesting result,
the disformal coupling changes the equation of state of the gauge field from
radiation to matter at some stages of the evolution of the universe, thereby
the gauge field can contribute to some fraction of the total dark matter. We
have also quantified the redshift-dependent contribution of the gauge field in
the form of dark radiation during the radiation era to the effective number of
relativistic species. This depends essentially on the initial conditions and,
more importantly, on the disformal coupling function.

various. We find a general mechanism for the distribution. The distribution of
a geometrically growing system can be approximated by a log - completely
squared chi distribution with 1 degree of freedom (log-CS$\chi_1$), which
reaches asymptotically a power-law distribution, or by a log-normal
distribution, which has an infinite asymptotic slope, at the upper limit. For
the log-CS$\chi_1$, the asymptotic exponent of the power-law or the slope in a
log-log diagram seems to be related only to the variances of the system
parameters and their mutual correlation but independent of an initial
distribution of the system or any mean value of parameters. We can take the
log-CS$\chi_1$ as a unique approximation when the system should have a singular
initial distribution. The mechanism shows a comprehensiveness to be applicable
to wide practice. We derive a simple formula for the Zipf's exponent, which
will probably demand that the exponent should be near -1 rather than exactly
-1. We show that this approach can explain statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic.

programs are increasingly being adopted and deployed. These models have
demonstrated success in applications such as auto-completing code, summarizing
large programs, and detecting bugs and malware in programs. In this work, we
investigate principled ways to adversarially perturb a computer program to fool
such learned models, and thus determine their adversarial robustness. We use
program obfuscations, which have conventionally been used to avoid attempts at
reverse engineering programs, as adversarial perturbations. These perturbations
modify programs in ways that do not alter their functionality but can be
crafted to deceive an ML model when making a decision. We provide a general
formulation for an adversarial program that allows applying multiple
obfuscation transformations to a program in any language. We develop
first-order optimization algorithms to efficiently determine two key aspects --
which parts of the program to transform, and what transformations to use. We
show that it is important to optimize both these aspects to generate the best
adversarially perturbed program. Due to the discrete nature of this problem, we
also propose using randomized smoothing to improve the attack loss landscape to
ease optimization. We evaluate our work on Python and Java programs on the
problem of program summarization. We show that our best attack proposal
achieves a $52\%$ improvement over a state-of-the-art attack generation
approach for programs trained on a seq2seq model. We further show that our
formulation is better at training models that are robust to adversarial
attacks.

Still, numerous challenges need to be resolved. The impact of deep learning has
changed the landscape of the vision-based system, such as action recognition.
The deep learning technique has not been successfully implemented in
vision-based fall detection systems due to the requirement of a large amount of
computation power and the requirement of a large amount of sample training
data. This research aims to propose a vision-based fall detection system that
improves the accuracy of fall detection in some complex environments such as
the change of light condition in the room. Also, this research aims to increase
the performance of the pre-processing of video images. The proposed system
consists of the Enhanced Dynamic Optical Flow technique that encodes the
temporal data of optical flow videos by the method of rank pooling, which
thereby improves the processing time of fall detection and improves the
classification accuracy in dynamic lighting conditions. The experimental
results showed that the classification accuracy of the fall detection improved
by around 3% and the processing time by 40 to 50ms. The proposed system
concentrates on decreasing the processing time of fall detection and improving
classification accuracy. Meanwhile, it provides a mechanism for summarizing a
