behavior. In this work we propose a novel type of intrinsic half-integer
Quantum Hall effect in 2D materials, thereby also offering a topological
protection mechanism for the current. Its existence is rooted in the 2D parity
anomaly, without any need for a perpendicular magnetic field. We conjecture
that it may occur in disturbed honeycomb lattices where both spin degeneracy
and time reversal symmetry are broken. These configurations harbor two distinct
gap-opening mechanisms that, when occurring simultaneously, drive slightly
different gaps in each valley, causing a net anomalous conductivity when the
chemical potential is tuned to be between the distinct gaps. Some examples of
promising material setups that fulfill the prerequisites of our proposal are
also listed to motivate looking for the effect at the numerical and
experimental level.

Molecular Zone, the Near and Far 3-kpc arms, the Molecular Ring, and the spiral

by the recent BeSSeL2 survey. The central gas kinematics are consistent with a
mass of $6.9\times10^8\; {\rm M}_{\odot}$ in the Nuclear Stellar Disk. Our
model predicts the formation of an elliptical gaseous ring surrounding the bar,
which is composed of the 3-kpc arms, Norma arm, and the bar-spiral interfaces.
This ring is similar to those ""inner"" rings in some Milky Way analogs with a
boxy/peanut-shaped bulge. The kinematics of gas near the solar neighbourhood
are governed by the Local arm, which is induced by the four major stellar
spiral arms. The bar pattern speed constrained by our gas model is $37.5-40\;

gently within the central $\sim5\;{\rm kpc}$, which is significantly less steep

the large energy needed to train and move data to/from data centers. Novel
paradigms, such as federated learning (FL), are suitable for decentralized
model training across devices or silos that simultaneously act as both data
producers and learners. Unlike centralized learning (CL) techniques, relying on
big-data fusion and analytics located in energy hungry data centers, in FL
scenarios devices collaboratively train their models without sharing their
private data. This article breaks down and analyzes the main factors that
influence the environmental footprint of FL policies compared with classical
CL/Big-Data algorithms running in data centers. The proposed analytical
framework takes into account both learning and communication energy costs, as
well as the carbon equivalent emissions; in addition, it models both vanilla
and decentralized FL policies driven by consensus. The framework is evaluated
in an industrial setting assuming a real-world robotized workplace. Results
show that FL allows remarkable end-to-end energy savings (30%-40%) for wireless
systems characterized by low bit/Joule efficiency (50 kbit/Joule or lower).
Consensus-driven FL does not require the parameter server and further reduces
emissions in mesh networks (200 kbit/Joule). On the other hand, all FL policies
are slower to converge when local data are unevenly distributed (often 2x
slower than CL). Energy footprint and learning loss can be traded off to
optimize efficiency.

  In this paper, we propose an efficient and lightweight deep classification

which are powerful probes of screened fifth forces. We show that the degree of
`U'-shaped warping of galaxies is well modelled by Gaussian random noise, but
that the magnitude of the gas-star offset is correlated with the virial radius
of the host halo. By incorporating this correlation we confirm recent results
ruling out astrophysically relevant Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity, and identify a
$\sim 30\%$ systematic uncertainty due to baryonic physics. Such an analysis

simulation. The resulting spatiotemporal variations are analyzed between the
different cases using unsteady statistics, $x-t$ diagrams, spectral analysis,
and modal decomposition. A cavity of length to depth ratio $[L/D]=2$ at a
freestream Mach number of $M_\infty = 1.71$ is considered to be in a confined
passage. Impinging shock strength is controlled by changing the ramp angle
($\theta$) on the top-wall. The static pressure ratio across the impinging
shock ($p_2/p_1$) is used to quantify the impinging shock strength. Five
different impinging shock strengths are studied by changing the pressure ratio:
$1.0,1.2,1.5,1.7$ and $2.0$. As the pressure ratio increases from 1.0 to 2.0,
the cavity wall experiences a maximum pressure of 25% due to shock loading. At
[$p_2/p_1]=1.5$, fundamental fluidic mode or Rossiter's frequency corresponding
to $n=1$ mode vanishes whereas frequencies correspond to higher modes ($n=2$

inside the cavity with the transverse disturbances from the shock-shear layer
interactions is identified to drive the strong resonant behavior. Due to
Mach-reflections inside the confined passage at $[p_2/p_1]=2.0$, shock-cavity
resonance is lost. Based on the present findings, an idea to use a shock-laden
confined cavity flow in an enclosed supersonic wall-jet configuration as

before transmission and up-sampled during display, can potentially reduce data
rates with limited impact on perceptual quality. In this context, we conducted
a subjective study on a UHD video database, BVI-BD, to explore the relationship
between bit depth and visual quality. In this work, three bit depth adaptation
methods are investigated, including linear scaling, error diffusion, and a
novel adaptive Gaussian filtering approach. The results from a subjective
experiment indicate that above a critical bit depth, bit depth adaptation has
no significant impact on perceptual quality, while reducing the amount
information that is required to be transmitted. Below the critical bit depth,
advanced adaptation methods can be used to retain `good' visual quality (on
average) down to around 2 bits per color channel for the outlined experimental
setup - a large reduction compared to the typically used 8 bits per color
channel. A selection of image quality metrics were subsequently bench-marked on
the subjective data, and analysis indicates that a bespoke quality metric is
required for bit depth adaptation.

agent has one of $k$ different opinions. Agents choose random interaction
partners and revise their state according to a fixed transition function,
depending on their own state and the state of the interaction partners. The
goal is to reach a consensus configuration in which all agents agree on the
same opinion, and if there is initially a sufficiently large bias towards one
opinion, that opinion should prevail.
  We analyze a synchronized variant of the undecided state dynamics defined as
follows. The agents act in phases, consisting of a decision and a boosting
part. In the decision part, any agent that encounters an agent with a different
opinion becomes undecided. In the boosting part, undecided agents adopt the
first opinion they encounter.
  We consider this dynamics in the population model and the gossip model. For
the population model, our protocol reaches consensus (w.h.p.) in $O(\log^2 n)$
parallel time, providing the first polylogarithmic result for $k > 2$ (w.h.p.)
in this model. Without any assumption on the bias, fast consensus has only been
shown for $k = 2$ for the unsynchronized version of the undecided state
dynamics [Clementi et al., MFCS'18]. We show that the synchronized variant of
the undecided state dynamics reaches consensus (w.h.p.) in time $O(\log^2 n)$,
independently of the initial number, bias, or distribution of opinions. In both
models, we guarantee that if there is an initial bias of $\Omega(\sqrt{n \log
n})$, then (w.h.p.) that opinion wins.
  A simple extension of our protocol in the gossip model yields a dynamics that
does not depend on $n$ or $k$, is anonymous, and has (w.h.p.) runtime $O(\log^2
n)$. This solves an open problem formulated by Becchetti et al.~[Distributed

investigating the weaknesses of existing active learning methods, which do not
take the unique challenges of object detection into account. (ii) CALD unifies
box regression and classification with a single metric, which is not concerned
by active learning methods for classification. CALD also focuses on the most
informative local region rather than the whole image, which is beneficial for
object detection. (iii) CALD not only gauges individual information for sample

distribution. Extensive experiments show that CALD significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art task-agnostic and detection-specific active learning

The reactive desorption is the key mechanism for producing these COMs and

respect to coarse-grained (CG) variables can greatly reduce computational cost

many applications. However, it usually experiences significantly altered
dynamics due to loss of degrees of freedom upon coarse-graining. To establish
CG models that can faithfully preserve dynamics, previous efforts mainly
focused on equilibrium systems. In contrast, various soft matter systems are
known out of equilibrium. Therefore, the present work concerns non-equilibrium
systems and enables accurate and efficient CG modeling that preserves
non-equilibrium dynamics and is generally applicable to any non-equilibrium
process and any observable of interest. To this end, the dynamic equation of a
CG variable is built in the form of the non-stationary generalized Langevin
equation (nsGLE) to account for the dependence of non-equilibrium processes on
the initial conditions, where the two-time memory kernel is determined from the
data of the two-time auto-correlation function of the non-equilibrium
trajectory-averaged observable of interest. By embedding the non-stationary
non-Markovian process in an extended stochastic framework, an explicit form of
the non-stationary random noise in the nsGLE is introduced, and the cost is
significantly reduced for solving the nsGLE to predict the non-equilibrium
dynamics of the CG variable. To prove and exploit the equivalence of the nsGLE

exponential expansion. A data-driven hybrid optimization process is proposed
for the parameterization, a non-convex and high-dimensional optimization

edge states. Here, we review the state-of-the-art techniques most amenable to
the investigation of such systems, because they combine the highest magnetic
field sensitivity with the highest spatial resolution and are minimally
invasive: magnetic force microscopy, scanning superconducting quantum
interference device microscopy, and scanning nitrogen-vacancy center

the prospects for improving each technique and speculate on its potential
impact, especially in the rapidly growing field of two-dimensional (2D)

measurements are fused to create a model of a complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal

Similar patterns are observed further down the magnetotail with greater
variability. Thermal electron densities are highly variable throughout the
magnetotail; average densities are typically ~20-50 /cc within the optical
shadow of Mars and can peak at ~100 /cc just outside of the optical shadow.
Standard deviations of 100% are observed for average densities measured
throughout the tail. Analysis of the local magnetic field topology suggests
that thermal electrons observed within the optical shadow of Mars are likely
sourced from the nightside ionosphere, whereas electrons observed just outside
of the optical shadow are likely sourced from the dayside ionosphere. Finally,
thermal electrons within the optical shadow of Mars are up to 20% more likely

multipartite quantum correlations and at the same time, it reduces the parent

entanglement measures can capture certain features of a multisite composite
system that are inaccessible via bipartite quantum correlation quantifiers. We
merge these two concepts by introducing localizable genuine multimode
entanglement for continuous variable systems, both for Gaussian and
non-Gaussian multimode parent states. We report a compact form of localizable
generalized geometric measure for multimode Gaussian states when Gaussian
measurements are performed in some of the modes. We show that non-Gaussian
measurements can concentrate more genuine multimode entanglement compared to
the Gaussian ones. For non-Gaussian states with non-Gaussian measurements, we
find that although four-mode squeezed vacuum state has permutation symmetry
with respect to the exchange of first and third modes as well as the second and
the fourth modes, the symmetry can be broken by performing measurements in one
of the modes in case of addition while for subtraction, such symmetry is
preserved, thereby providing a method for distinguishing multimode photon-added

(VOS) in the wild where users can choose some frames for annotations
iteratively. Then, based on the user annotations, a segmentation algorithm
refines the masks. The previous interactive VOS paradigm selects the frame with
some worst evaluation metric, and the ground truth is required for calculating
the evaluation metric, which is impractical in the testing phase. In contrast,
in this paper, we advocate that the frame with the worst evaluation metric may
not be exactly the most valuable frame that leads to the most performance
improvement across the video. Thus, we formulate the frame selection problem in
the interactive VOS as a Markov Decision Process, where an agent is learned to
recommend the frame under a deep reinforcement learning framework. The learned
agent can automatically determine the most valuable frame, making the
interactive setting more practical in the wild. Experimental results on the
public datasets show the effectiveness of our learned agent without any changes
to the underlying VOS algorithms. Our data, code, and models are available at

capabilities of steady-state EAs. For the standard bimodal benchmark function
\twomax we rigorously prove that using uniform parent selection leads to
exponential runtimes with high probability to locate both optima for the
standard ($\mu$+1)~EA and ($\mu$+1)~RLS with any polynomial population sizes.
On the other hand, we prove that selecting the worst individual as parent leads
to efficient global optimisation with overwhelming probability for reasonable
population sizes. Since always selecting the worst individual may have
detrimental effects for escaping from local optima, we consider the performance
of stochastic parent selection operators with low selective pressure for a
function class called \textsc{TruncatedTwoMax} where one slope is shorter than
the other. An experimental analysis shows that the EAs equipped with inverse
tournament selection, where the loser is selected for reproduction and small
tournament sizes, globally optimise \textsc{TwoMax} efficiently and effectively
escape from local optima of \textsc{TruncatedTwoMax} with high probability.
Thus they identify both optima efficiently while uniform (or stronger)
selection fails in theory and in practice. We then show the power of inverse
selection on function classes from the literature where populations are
essential by providing rigorous proofs or experimental evidence that it
outperforms uniform selection equipped with or without a restart strategy. We
conclude the paper by confirming our theoretical insights with an empirical
analysis of the different selective pressures on standard benchmarks of the
classical MaxSat and Multidimensional Knapsack Problems.

nights of HARPS-N spectra covering five transits of KELT-20b. We computed the
mean line profiles of the spectra with a least-squares deconvolution, and then
we extracted the stellar radial velocities by fitting them with a rotational
broadening profile in order to obtain the radial velocity time-series. We used
the mean line profile residuals tomography to analyse the planetary atmospheric
signal and its variations. We also used the cross-correlation method to study
an already known double-peak feature in the FeI planetary signal. We observed
both the classical and the atmospheric Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in the radial

planetary atmosphere that correlates with the stellar mask used in our work:
R(p+atmo)/Rp = 1.13 +/- 0.02). We isolated the planetary atmospheric trace in
the tomography, and we found radial velocity variations of the planetary

of probability distributions and its extension beyond linear Gaussian
applications is not obvious. Our second filter is based on geometric average
fusion and it approximates the multi-sensor, multi-object Bayes filter's
posterior distribution using the geometric average of each sensor's
measurement-updated distribution. This filter can be used under non-linear
conditions; however, it is not as accurate as our first filter. In both cases,
we approximate the LMB filter's measurement update using an existing loopy
belief propagation algorithm. Both filters have a constant complexity in the
number of sensors, and linear complexity in both number of measurements and
objects. This is an improvement on an iterated-corrector LMB (IC-LMB) filter,
which has linear complexity in the number of sensors. The proposed filters are
of interest when tracking many objects using several sensors, where filter
run-time is more important than filter accuracy. We evaluate both filters'

planets, what are the most promising signatures to look for, and if these
""exo-lightning"" signatures can be detected from Earth.
  This thesis focuses on three major topics. First I discuss a lightning
climatology study of Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus. I apply the obtained
lightning statistics to extrasolar planets in order to give a first estimate on
lightning occurrence on exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Next, I introduce a short
study of potential lightning activity on the exoplanet HAT-P-11b, based on
previous radio observations. Related to this, I discuss a first estimate of
observability of lightning from close brown dwarfs, with the optical Danish

which is applied to study the energy and radio power released from lightning
discharges in hot giant gas planetary and brown dwarf atmospheres. The released
energy determines the observability of signatures, and the effect lightning has
on the local atmosphere of the object.
  This work combines knowledge obtained from planetary and earth sciences and
uses that to learn more about extrasolar systems. My main results show that
lightning on exoplanets may be more energetic than in the Solar System,
supporting the possibility of future observations and detection of lightning
activity on an extrasolar body. My work provides the base for future radio,

while the RF synthesis and imaging control was maintained on the host MR
scanner. The add on pTx system relies on the RF transmit signal, unblanking
pulse, and a protocol driven trigger from the scanner. The RF transmit was

custom transceiver coils. The performance of the 8-channel implementation was

interest because it can modify the electronic spectrum of the two-dimensional

condensed-matter phases such as superconductors, Mott insulators, Wigner
crystals and quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Previous works predominantly
focus on the flat band dispersion of coupled Dirac states from different
graphene layers. In this work, we propose a new route to realizing flat band
physics in monolayer graphene under a periodic modulation from substrates. We
take gaphene/SiC heterostructure as a role model and demonstrate experimentally
the substrate modulation leads to Dirac fermion cloning and consequently, the
proximity of the two Dirac cones of monolayer graphene in momentum space. Our
theoretical modeling captures the cloning mechanism of Dirac states and
indicates that flat bands can emerge at certain magic lattice constants of
substrate when the period of modulation becomes nearly commensurate with the
$(\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3})R30^{\circ}$ supercell of graphene. The results show
that the epitaxial monolayer graphene is a promising platform for exploring
exotic many-body quantum phases arising from interactions between Dirac
electrons.

bring a system to its tipping point. Here, we explore this diversity of

Bell nonlocality using multiple copies of the maximally entangled two-qubit
state carried by a single pair of particles, such as hyperentangled states, and
the product of Pauli measurements. It is known that in a
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell test the symmetric detection efficiency
of $82.84\%$ can be tolerated for the two-qubit maximally entangled state. We
beat this enigmatic threshold by entangling two particles with multiple degrees
of freedom. The obtained upper bounds of the symmetric detection efficiency
thresholds are $80.86\%$, $73.99\%$ and $69.29\%$ for two, three and four
copies of the two-qubit maximally entangled state, respectively. The number of
measurements and outcomes in the respective cases are 4, 8 and 16. To find the
improved thresholds, we use large-scale convex optimization tools, which allows
us to significantly go beyond state-of-the-art results. The proof is exact up
to three copies, while for four copies it is due to reliable numerical
computations. Specifically, we used linear programming to obtain the two-copy
threshold and the corresponding Bell inequality, and convex optimization based
on Gilbert's algorithm for three and four copies of the two-qubit state. We
show analytically that the symmetric detection efficiency threshold decays
exponentially with the number of copies of the two-qubit state. Our techniques
can also be applied to more general Bell nonlocality scenarios with more than
two parties.

by showing that for any fixed $k$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, and sufficiently large
$n$, all tournaments with degrees at least $\frac{n}{4}+\varepsilon n$ contain

progress on determining a more accurate error term in the degree condition,
neither in understanding how large $n$ should be in the
Bollob\'{a}s-H\""{a}ggkvist theorem. We essentially resolve both of these

contains the $k$-th power of a Hamilton cycle. In particular, in order to
guarantee the square of a Hamilton cycle, one only requires a constant additive

Tur\'an numbers for complete bipartite graphs, shows that the error term must
be of order at least $n^{1-1/\lceil (k-1)/2 \rceil}$, which matches our upper
bound for all even $k$. For odd $k$, we believe that the lower bound can be
improved. Indeed, we show that for $k=3$, there exist tournaments with degrees
$\frac{n}{4}+\Omega(n^{1/5})$ and no cube of a Hamilton cycle. In addition, our
results imply that the Bollob\'{a}s-H\""{a}ggkvist theorem already holds for $n

Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) services is a key challenge for the current and future
wireless communication networks. Those two types of services introduce strict,
and in some time conflicting, resource allocation requirements that may result
in a power-struggle between reliability, latency, and resource utilization in
wireless networks. The difficulty in addressing that challenge could be traced
back to the predominant reactive approach in allocating the wireless resources.
This allocation operation is carried out based on received service requests and
global network statistics, which may not incorporate a sense of
\textit{proaction}. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework termed
\textit{service identification} to develop novel proactive resource allocation
algorithms. The developed framework is based on visual data (captured for
example by RGB cameras) and deep learning (e.g., deep neural networks). The
ultimate objective of this framework is to equip future wireless networks with
the ability to analyze user behavior, anticipate incoming services, and perform
proactive resource allocation. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed
framework, a wireless network scenario with two coexisting URLL and eMBB
services is considered, and two deep learning algorithms are designed to
utilize RGB video frames and predict incoming service type and its request
time. An evaluation dataset based on the considered scenario is developed and
used to evaluate the performance of the two algorithms. The results confirm the
anticipated value of proaction to wireless networks; the proposed models enable
efficient network performance ensuring more than $85\%$ utilization of the
network resources at $\sim 98\%$ reliability. This highlights a promising
direction for the future vision-aided wireless communication networks.

Building on the median-of-means (MOM) method introduced by Lecue and Lerasle
Ann.Statist.48(2):906-931(April 2020) in the case of known noise variance, we
propose a general MOM approach for simultaneous inference of both the
regression function and the noise variance, requiring only an upper bound on
the noise level. Interestingly, this generalization requires care due to
regularity issues that are intrinsic to the underlying convex-concave
optimization problem. In the general case where the regression function belongs
to a convex class, we show that our simultaneous estimator achieves with high
probability the same convergence rates and a similar risk bound as if the noise
level was unknown, as well as convergence rates for the estimated noise
standard deviation.
  In the high-dimensional sparse linear setting, our estimator yields a robust
analog of the square-root LASSO. Under weak moment conditions, it jointly
achieves with high probability the minimax rates of estimation $s^{1/p}
\sqrt{(1/n) \log(p/s)}$ for the $\ell_p$-norm of the coefficient vector, and
the rate $\sqrt{(s/n) \log(p/s)}$ for the estimation of the noise standard
deviation. Here $n$ denotes the sample size, $p$ the dimension and $s$ the
sparsity level. We finally propose an extension to the case of unknown sparsity
level $s$, providing a jointly adaptive estimator $(\widetilde \beta,
\widetilde \sigma, \widetilde s)$. It simultaneously estimates the coefficient
vector, the noise level and the sparsity level, with proven bounds on each of
these three components that hold with high probability.

generalization performance on CIFAR and ImageNet without changing the modeling

defines primitives using an Invertible Neural Network (INN) which implements
homeomorphic mappings between a sphere and the target object. The INN allows us
to compute the inverse mapping of the homeomorphism, which in turn, enables the
efficient computation of both the implicit surface function of a primitive and
its mesh, without any additional post-processing. Our model learns to parse 3D
objects into semantically consistent part arrangements without any part-level

interpreted as a super-massive black hole, but can in principle also be a
sub-cluster of stellar remnants. We explore the following two formation
scenarios of UCDs, i) monolithic collapse and ii) mergers of star clusters in
cluster complexes as are observed in massively star-bursting regions. We
explore the physical properties of the UCDs at different evolutionary stages
assuming different initial stellar masses of the UCDs and the IMF being either
universal or changing systematically with metallicity and density according to
the Integrated Galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory. While the observed elevated
$M/L_{\rm V}$ ratios of the UCDs cannot be reproduced if the IMF is invariant
and universal, the empirically derived IMF which varies systematically with
density and metallicity shows agreement with the observations. Incorporating
the UCD-mass-dependent retention fraction of dark remnants improves this
agreement. In addition we apply the results of N-body simulations to young UCDs
and show that the same initial conditions describing the observed $M/L_{\rm V}$
ratios reproduce the observed relation between the half-mass radii and the
present-day masses of the UCDs. The findings thus suggest that the majority of
UCDs that have elevated $M/L_{\rm V}$ ratios could have formed monolithically
with significant remnant-mass components that are centrally concentrated, while
those with small $M/L_V$ values may be merged star-cluster complexes.

anti-correlation is quite extended, which is in agreement with the long tail on
the blue horizontal branch, and the large star-to-star variations in the
[Mg/Fe] ratio span more than 0.5 dex. Recently, significant excesses of Ca and
Sc with respect to field stars of a similar metallicity were also found,
signaling the production of species forged in H-burning at a very high
temperature in the polluters of the first generation in this cluster. Since an
enhancement of potassium is also expected under these conditions, we tested
this scenario by analysing intermediate resolution spectra of 59 cluster stars
including the K I resonance line at 7698.98 A. We found a wide spread of K
abundances, anti-correlated to Mg and O abundances, as previously also observed
in NGC 2808. The abundances of K are found to be correlated to those of Na, Ca,
and Sc. Overall, this chemical pattern confirms that NGC 4833 is one of the
relatively few GCs where the self-enrichment from first generation polluters
occurred at such high temperatures that proton-capture reactions were able to
proceed up to heavier species such as K and possibly Ca. The spread in K
observed in GCs appears to be a function of a linear combination of cluster
total luminosity and metallicity, as other chemical signatures of multiple
stellar populations in GCs.

measure $R_{21}$ across the full star-forming disc of nine nearby, massive,
star-forming spiral galaxies at 27"" (${\sim} 1{-}2$ kpc) resolution. We find an
average $R_{21} = 0.64\pm0.09$ when we take the luminosity-weighted mean of all
individual galaxies. This result is consistent with the mean ratio for disc
galaxies that we derive from single-pointing measurements in the literature,
$R_{\rm 21, lit}~=~0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.09}$. The ratio shows weak radial
variations compared to the point-to-point scatter in the data. In six out of
nine targets the central enhancement in $R_{21}$ with respect to the
galaxy-wide mean is of order $\sim 10{-}20\%$. We estimate an azimuthal scatter
of $\sim$20% in $R_{21}$ at fixed galactocentric radius but this measurement is
limited by our comparatively coarse resolution of 1.5 kpc. We find mild
correlations between $R_{21}$ and CO brightness temperature, IR intensity,
70-to-160$ \mu$m ratio, and IR-to-CO ratio. All correlations indicate that
$R_{21}$ increases with gas surface density, star formation rate surface

neglected expulsion of gas by stellar feedback, or considered extremely high

immediate consequences, predicting e.g. the slope and normalization of the

explanations for outliers in compact Es. Most strikingly, because star

textures of vanishing Yukawa couplings in their low energy description. The
vanishing of these couplings is often not enforced by any obvious symmetry and
appears to be topological in nature. Recent results in the literature used
differential geometric methods to explain the origin of some of this structure.
A vanishing theorem was given which showed that the effect could be attributed,
in part, to the embedding of the Calabi-Yau manifolds of interest inside higher
dimensional ambient spaces, if the gauge bundles involved descended from vector
bundles on those larger manifolds. In this paper, we utilize an
algebro-geometric approach to provide an alternative derivation of some of
these results, and are thus able to generalize them to a much wider arena than
has been considered before. For example, we consider cases where the vector
bundles of interest do not descend from bundles on the ambient space. In such a
manner we are able to highlight the ubiquity with which textures of vanishing
Yukawa couplings can be expected to arise in heterotic compactifications, with
multiple different constraints arising from a plethora of different geometric
features associated to the gauge bundle.

Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument. The astroGIS database has
been used in processing the data (https://www.astrogis.org)
\cite{2020MNRAS.493.1204A}. The total energy released to space from Turkey
increased by 80\% in 2019 with respect to 2012. In the span of the dataset, a
steady and continuous increase has been observed throughout all cities of the
country. On the other hand, Dark Sky Park locations, East and Southeast
Anatolian regions and mostly rural areas around the cities kept their AL level
constant. Four demographic parameters have been studied and they were found to
be correlated very well with AL: Population ($R \simeq 0.90$); GDP ($R \simeq
0.87$); Total Power Consumption ($R \simeq 0.66$) and Outdoor Lightening ($R
\simeq 0.67$). Contrary to countries acting to prevent AL increases, Turkey
seems to be at the beginning of an era where AL will arithmetically increase
throughout the country and enormous amount of energy will continuously escape
to space and therefore will be wasted. Therefore, a preventive legislation,
especially for invaluable astronomical site locations such as TURAG, TUG, DAG
and \c{C}AAM where each is counted as a truly dark site due to their SQM
values, has to be enacted in Turkey, in very near future.

important is the traffic control at borders and ports that exploits Radiation
Portal Monitors (RPMs) to detect and deter potential smuggling attempts. Most
portal monitors rely on plastic scintillators to detect gamma rays. Despite
their poor energy resolution, their cost effectiveness and the possibility of
growing them in large sizes makes them the gamma-ray detector of choice in
RPMs. Unmixing algorithms applied to organic scintillator spectra can be used
to reliably identify the bare and unshielded radionuclides that triggered an
alarm, even with fewer than 1,000 detected counts and in the presence of two or
three nuclides at the same time. In this work, we experimentally studied the
robustness of a state-of-the-art unmixing algorithm to different radiation
background spectra, due to varying atmospheric conditions, in the 16 $^\circ$C
to 28 $^\circ$C temperature range. In the presence of background, the algorithm
is able to identify the nuclides present in unknown radionuclide mixtures of
three nuclides, when at least 1,000 counts from the sources are detected. With
fewer counts available, we found larger differences of approximately 35.9$\%$
between estimated nuclide fractions and actual ones. In these low count rate
regimes, the uncertainty associated by our algorithm with the identified
fractions could be an additional valuable tool to determine whether the
identification is reliable or a longer measurement to increase the
signal-to-noise ratio is needed. Moreover, the algorithm identification
performances are consistent throughout different data sets, with negligible
differences in the presence of background types of different intensity and
spectral shape.

emerges in the superradiance of multiple, phase-locked emitters, and more
recently, coherence and long-range order have been investigated in bosonic

Michelson interferometry, we capture clear evidence of increased spatial and

behaviour of the emitted light intensity, which is a fingerprint of a polariton

strategy for structure calculation and reconstruction of discrete state
dynamics from RDC data. Our method utilizes the previously presented REDCRAFT
software package and its dynamic-profile analysis to complete the task of
fragmented structure determination and identification of the onset of dynamics
from RDC data. Fragmented structure determination was used to demonstrate
successful structure calculation of static and dynamic domains for several
models of dynamics. We provide a mechanism of producing an ensemble of
conformations for the dynamical regions that describe any observed order tensor
discrepancies between the static and dynamic domains within a protein. In
addition, the presented method is capable of approximating relative occupancy
of each conformational state. The developed methodology has been evaluated on
simulated RDC data with 1Hz of error from an 83 residue {\alpha} protein (PDBID
1A1Z), and a 213 residue {\alpha}/\b{eta} protein DGCR8 (PDBID 2YT4). Using
1A1Z, various models of arc and complex two and three discrete-state dynamics
were simulated. MD simulation was used to generate a 2-state dynamics for
DGCR8. In both instances our method reproduced structure of the protein
including the conformational ensemble to within less than 2{\AA}. Based on our
investigations, arc motions with more than 30{\deg} of rotation are recognized
as internal dynamics and are reconstructed with sufficient accuracy.
Furthermore, states with relative occupancies above 20% are consistently
recognized and reconstructed successfully. Arc motions with magnitude of
15{\deg} or relative occupancy of less than 10% are consistently unrecognizable
as dynamical regions.

galaxies in the early Universe. Among them, the ionizing stellar populations
and the gas geometry make the recipes designed to derive chemical abundances
from nebular emission lines to differ from those calibrated in the Local
Universe. A sample of 1969 Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) at a redshift
0 < z < 0.49, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to be local
analogues of high-redshift galaxies, was used to analyze their most prominent
emission lines and to derive total oxygen abundances and nitrogen-to-oxygen
ratios following the direct method in the ranges 7.7 < 12+log(O/H) < 8.6 and
-1.8 < log(N/O) < -0.8. They allow us to obtain new empirically calibrated
strong-line methods and to evaluate other recipes based on photoionization
models that can be later used for a chemical analysis of actively star-forming
galaxies in very early stages of galaxy evolution. Our new relations are in
agreement with others found for smaller samples of objects at higher redshifts.
When compared with other relations calibrated in the local Universe, they
differ when the employed strong-line ratio depends on the hardness of the
ionizing radiation, such as O32 or Ne3O2, but they do not when the main
dependence is on the ionization parameter, such as S23. In the case of
strong-line ratios depending on [NII] lines, the derivation of O/H becomes very
uncertain due to the very high N/O values derived in this sample, above all in
the low-metallicity regime. Finally, we adapt the bayesian-like code
HII-Chi-mistry for the conditions found in this kind of galaxies and we prove
that it can be used to derive within errors both O/H and N/O, in consistency
with the direct method .

present new ALMA observations at Band7 (0.9mm) and Band4 (2.1mm) of CIDA1 with
a resolution of $\sim 0.05''\times 0.034''$. These new ALMA observations reveal
a very bright and unresolved inner disk, a shallow spectral index of the dust

present X-Shooter (VLT) observations that confirm the high accretion rate of
CIDA1 of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$=1.4 $\times~10^{-8}M_\odot$/yr. This high value of
$\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$, the observed inner disk, and the large cavity of 20au
exclude models of photo-evaporation to explain the observed cavity. When
comparing these observations with models that combine planet-disk interaction,
dust evolution, and radiative transfer, we exclude planets more massive than
0.5$M_{\rm{Jup}}$ as the potential origin of the large cavity because with
these it is difficult to maintain a long-lived and bright inner disk. Even in
this planet mass regime, an additional physical process may be needed to stop
the particles from migrating inwards and to maintain a bright inner disk on
timescales of millions of years. Such mechanisms include a trap formed by a
very close-in extra planet or the inner edge of a dead zone. The low spectral
index of the disk around CIDA1 is difficult to explain and challenges our
current dust evolution models, in particular processes like fragmentation,
growth, and diffusion of particles inside pressure bumps.

The introduction of curvature shifts the range for which the TW is the ground

Furthermore, we demonstrate qualitatively the same behavior in solid

tubes curvature tends to suppress the transformation from the TW to VW, in

mission concept that can only be accomplished with a next-generation grating
spectrometer. Realizing such an instrument using reflection grating technology
requires thousands of custom blazed gratings that each perform with high
diffraction efficiency to be manufactured and aligned to intercept radiation
coming to a focus in a Wolter-I telescope. The aim of this thesis is to
implement two recently-developed techniques in nanofabrication for this task,
with an emphasis on beamline diffraction-efficiency testing for characterizing
spectral sensitivity. In particular, thermally-activated selective topography
equilibration (TASTE) is pursued as a means for fabricating a master grating
with the key advantage that it enables blazed groove facets to be patterned in
polymeric electron-beam resist over a non-parallel groove layout not limited by
substrate crystal structure. Additionally, substrate-conformal imprint
lithography (SCIL) is studied as a method for mass manufacturing high-fidelity
grating replicas in a silica sol-gel resist while avoiding many of the
detriments associated with large-area patterning in other nanoimprint
techniques. Diffraction-efficiency testing of sub-micron grating prototypes
coated with gold shows that TASTE is capable of meeting Lynx requirements for
spectral sensitivity, with room for improvement at small groove periods, and
that while SCIL offers a promising avenue for Lynx grating production, imprints
suffer a small blaze-angle reduction due to resist shrinkage. Accompanying this
dissertation are appendices that outline physics fundamentals for x-ray
spectral lines, x-ray optics, and diffraction gratings.

research works in information retrieval. Query expansion is a retrieval
technique that has been studied and proved to yield positive results in
relevance. Users are required to express their queries as a shortlist of words,
sentences, or questions. With this short format, a huge amount of information
is lost in the process of translating the information need from the actual
query size since the user cannot convey all his thoughts in a few words. This
mostly leads to poor query representation which contributes to undesired
retrieval effectiveness. This loss of information has made the study of query
expansion technique a strong area of study. This research work focuses on two
methods of retrieval for both tweet-length queries and sentence-length queries.
Two algorithms have been proposed and the implementation is expected to produce
a better relevance retrieval model than most state-the-art relevance models.

Unsupervised clustering is performed using K-Means and K-Medoids. The results
show the superiority of DCT-based method, entropy-based method, and CVAE

noticeably much faster than the existing CVAE. Furthermore, for

we propose two timescale hybrid federated learning (TT-HF), a
semi-decentralized learning architecture that combines the conventional
device-to-server communication paradigm for federated learning with
device-to-device (D2D) communications for model training. In TT-HF, during each
global aggregation interval, devices (i) perform multiple stochastic gradient
descent iterations on their individual datasets, and (ii) aperiodically engage
in consensus procedure of their model parameters through cooperative,
distributed D2D communications within local clusters. With a new general
definition of gradient diversity, we formally study the convergence behavior of
TT-HF, resulting in new convergence bounds for distributed ML. We leverage our
convergence bounds to develop an adaptive control algorithm that tunes the step
size, D2D communication rounds, and global aggregation period of TT-HF over
time to target a sublinear convergence rate of O(1/t) while minimizing network
resource utilization. Our subsequent experiments demonstrate that TT-HF
significantly outperforms the current art in federated learning in terms of
model accuracy and/or network energy consumption in different scenarios where
local device datasets exhibit statistical heterogeneity. Finally, our numerical
evaluations demonstrate robustness against outages caused by fading channels,
as well favorable performance with non-convex loss functions.

display spectra with exponential cutoffs in a narrow range around a few GeV.
Models predicted cutoffs up to 100 GeV; it was therefore not expected that
pulsars would be visible in the very-high-energy ($>$100 GeV) regime.
Subsequent surprise discoveries by ground-based telescopes of pulsed emission
from four pulsars above tens of GeV have marked the beginning of a new era,
raising important questions about the electrodynamics and local environment of
pulsar magnetospheres. Detection of the Vela pulsar by H.E.S.S. (20-120 GeV)
and Fermi provides evidence for a curved spectrum. We posit this to result from
curvature radiation via primary particles in the pulsar magnetosphere and
current sheet. We present energy-dependent light curves using an extended slot
gap and current sheet model and invoking a two-step accelerating $E$-field as
motivated by kinetic simulations. I include a refined calculation of the
curvature radius of particle trajectories, impacting the particle transport,
predicted light curves, and spectra. The model reproduces the decrease of flux
of the first light-curve peak relative to the second one, evolution of the
bridge emission, near constant phase positions of peaks, and narrowing of
pulses with increasing energy. We can fundamentally explain the first of these
trends, since I found that the curvature radii of the particle trajectories in
regions where the second $\gamma$-ray light curve peak originates are
systematically larger than those associated with the first peak, implying a
correspondingly larger cutoff for the second peak. An unknown azimuthal
dependence of the $E$-field as well as uncertainty in the precise emission
locale preclude a simplistic discrimination of emission mechanisms.

attributed to accretion events, both via direct accretion, as well as through
the heating of the disc stars. Recent studies have shown that retrograde orbits
can also be produced via scattering by dense clumps, which are often present in
the early stages of a galaxy's evolution. However, so far it has been unclear
whether other internally-driven mechanisms, such as bars, are also capable of
driving retrograde motion. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the
efficiencies with which bars and clumps produce retrograde orbits in disc
galaxies. We do this by comparing the retrograde fractions and the spatial
distributions of the retrograde populations in four $N$-body$+$smooth particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of isolated disc galaxies spanning a range of
evolutionary behaviours. We find that both bars and clumps are capable of
generating significant retrograde populations of order $\sim 10\%$ of all
stars. We also find that while clump-driven retrograde stars may be found at
large galactocentric radii, bar-driven retrograde stars remain in the vicinity
of the bar, even if the bar dissolves. Consequently, we find that retrograde
stars in the Solar Neighbourhood in the clumpy models are exclusively
clump-driven, but this is a trace population, constituting $0.01-0.04\%$ of the
total stellar population in this region. Finally, we find that neither bars
(including dissolving ones) nor clumps in the models are able to produce
rotationally supported counter-rotating discs.

is one among the defining goals of modern nanotechnology. Speckle tweezers (ST)
by incorporating randomly distributed light fields have been used to apply
detectable limits on the Brownian motion of micro-particles with refractive
indices higher than their medium. Indeed, compared to periodic potentials, ST
represents a wider possibility to be operated for such tasks. Here, we extend
the usefulness of ST into low index micro-particles. Repelling of such
particles by high intensity regions into lower intensity regions makes them to
be locally confined, and the confinement can be tuned by changing the average
grain intensity and size of the speckle patterns. Experiments on polystyrenes
and liposomes validate the procedure. Moreover, we show that ST can be used to
nano-particle (NP)-loaded liposomes. Interestingly, the different interactions
of NP-loaded and empty liposomes with ST enables collective manipulation of
their mixture using the same speckle pattern, which may be explained by
inclusion of the photophoretic forces on NPs in NP-loaded liposomes. Our
results on the different behavior between empty and non-empty vesicles may open

applications, especially in connection with the direct summand theorem, the

questions about these singularities remain elusive. One outstanding problem is
whether the splinter property spreads from a point to an open neighborhood of a
noetherian scheme. Our paper addresses this problem in prime characteristic,
where we show that a locally noetherian scheme that has finite Frobenius or
that is locally essentially of finite type over a quasi-excellent local ring
has an open splinter locus. In particular, all varieties over fields of
positive characteristic have open splinter loci. Intimate connections are
established between the openness of splinter loci and $F$-compatible ideals,
which are prime characteristic analogues of log canonical centers. We prove the
surprising fact that for a large class of noetherian rings with pure (aka

splitting of a single generically \'etale finite extension. We also show that

demographers in forecasting mortality. Although several stochastic mortality
models have been proposed in past literature, the mortality forecasting
research remains a crucial task. Recently, various research works encourage the
adequacy of deep learning models to extrapolate suitable pattern within
mortality data. Such a learning models allow to achieve accurate point
predictions, albeit also uncertainty measures are necessary to support both
model estimates reliability and risk evaluations. To the best of our knowledge,
machine and deep learning literature in mortality forecasting lack for studies
about uncertainty estimation. As new advance in mortality forecasting, we
formalizes the deep Neural Networks integration within the Lee-Carter
framework, posing a first bridge between the deep learning and the mortality
density forecasts. We test our model proposal in a numerical application
considering three representative countries worldwide and both genders,
scrutinizing two different fitting periods. Exploiting the meaning of both
biological reasonableness and plausibility of forecasts, as well as performance
metrics, our findings confirm the suitability of deep learning models to
improve the predictive capacity of the Lee-Carter model, providing more
reliable mortality boundaries also on the long-run.

correlated tests of multiple hypotheses are used. Multiple primary objectives

framework of the weighted parametric multiple test procedure from fixed designs
with a single analysis per objective to a GSD setting where different
objectives may be assessed at the same or different times, each in a group
sequential fashion. Pragmatic methods for design and analysis of weighted
parametric group sequential design(WPGSD) under closed testing procedures are
proposed to maintain the strong control of familywise Type I error rate (FWER)
when correlations between tests are incorporated. This results in the ability
to relax testing bounds compared to designs not fully adjusting for known
correlations, increasing power or allowing decreased sample size. We illustrate
the proposed methods using clinical trial examples and conduct a simulation

Significant degradation of PET image quality and tumor detectability was
observed with a decrease in the injected dose by more than 5%, leading to a
remarkable increase in RMSE from 0.173 SUV (at 5%) to 1.454 SUV (at 1%). The
quantitative investigation of the malignant lesions demonstrated that SUVmax
bias greatly increased in low-dose PET images (in particular at 1%, 2%, 3%

Gaussian filter on low-dose PET images led to a significant reduction in SUVmax

AGN, including a power-law possibly associated with Thomson-scattered
radiation. In this work, we study the properties of this scattered component
for a sample of 386 hard-X-ray-selected, nearby ($z \sim 0.03$) obscured AGN
from the 70-month Swift/BAT catalog. We investigate how the fraction of
Thomson-scattered radiation correlates with different physical properties of
AGN, such as line-of-sight column density, X-ray luminosity, black hole mass,
and Eddington ratio. We find a significant negative correlation between the
scattering fraction and the column density. Based on a large number of spectral
simulations, we exclude the possibility that this anti-correlation is due to
degeneracies between the parameters. The negative correlation also persists
when considering different ranges of luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington
ratio. We discuss how this correlation might be either due to the angle
dependence of the Thomson cross-section or to more obscured sources having a
higher covering factor of the torus. We also find a positive correlation
between the scattering fraction and the ratio of [OIII] $\lambda$5007 to X-ray
luminosity. This result is consistent with previous studies and suggests that
the Thomson-scattered component is associated with the narrow-line region.

highly non-trivial and requires a detailed understanding of not only the
associated mathematical techniques, but also the underlying physiology and
anatomy. Neural field theory is a population-level approach to modelling the
non-linear dynamics of large populations of neurons, while maintaining a degree
of mathematical tractability. This class of models provides a solid theoretical
perspective on fundamental processes of neural tissue such as state transitions
between different brain activities as observed during epilepsy or sleep.
Various anatomical, physiological, and mathematical assumptions are essential
for deriving a minimal set of equations that strike a balance between
biophysical realism and mathematical tractability. However, these assumptions
are not always made explicit throughout the literature. Even though neural
field models (NFMs) first appeared in the literature in the early 1970's, the
relationships between them have not been systematically addressed. This may
partially be explained by the fact that the inter-dependencies between these
models are often implicit and non-trivial. Herein we provide a review of key
stages of the history and development of neural field theory and contemporary
uses of this branch of mathematical neuroscience. First, the principles of the
theory are summarised throughout a discussion of the pioneering models by
Wilson and Cowan, Amari and Nunez. Upon thorough review of these models, we
then present a unified mathematical framework in which all neural field models
can be derived by applying different assumptions. We then use this framework to
i) derive contemporary models by Robinson, Jansen and Rit, Wendling, Liley, and

vehicles, are becoming prevalent in environmental sensing and monitoring
applications. These active sensing platforms operate in unsteady fluid flows,
including windy urban environments, hurricanes, and ocean currents. Often
constrained in their actuation capabilities, the dynamics of these mobile
sensors depend strongly on the background flow, making their deployment and
control particularly challenging. Therefore, efficient trajectory planning with
partial knowledge about the background flow is essential for teams of mobile
sensors to adaptively sense and monitor their environments. In this work, we
investigate the use of finite-horizon model predictive control (MPC) for the
energy-efficient trajectory planning of an active mobile sensor in an unsteady
fluid flow field. We uncover connections between the finite-time optimal
trajectories and finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) of the background flow,
confirming that energy-efficient trajectories exploit invariant coherent
structures in the flow. We demonstrate our findings on the unsteady double gyre
vector field, which is a canonical model for chaotic mixing in the ocean. We
present an exhaustive search through critical MPC parameters including the
prediction horizon, maximum sensor actuation, and relative penalty on the
accumulated state error and actuation effort. We find that even relatively
short prediction horizons can often yield nearly energy-optimal trajectories.
These results are promising for the adaptive planning of energy-efficient
trajectories for swarms of mobile sensors in distributed sensing and

increasing scrutiny. ICT projects continue to fail; as a result, while research
in ICT project management has indeed increased, many challenges for research
and practice remain. Many studies have addressed the execution and management
of ICT projects and the many factors that might relate to project outcomes.
Very few, however, have considered ICT project initiation and the crucial
decisions made at that very early, pre-life cycle stage. The primary intent of
this research is therefore to investigate ICT projects with a particular focus
on their initiation. In doing so we wished to understand why ICT projects are
started, and how they are moved from idea or proposal to supported reality. A
combination of semi-structured interviews and the repertory grid data
collection and analysis method was employed to investigate and validate the
motivating factors that influence individual IT Managers' project initiation
decisions and the methods they use to transition from idea to enacted project.
Our results showed that there are indeed multiple underlying reasons for the
decisions made at this early stage and that there are some especially common
decision drivers. Some were expected, in the sense that they mapped to
recommended best practice. For instance, most projects are motivated by a
desire to achieve efficiencies or cost savings, and their potential tends to be
assessed using cost benefit analysis. Other results were more surprising -
competitor pressure was not a common driver for ICT project initiation in our
analysis. Unsurprisingly, formal evaluation methods are more frequently used to
assess project proposals when those projects are larger and higher profile.

synthesis tasks including image super-resolution, and style transfer. It was
believed that the success lies in the high-level perceptual feature
representations extracted from CNNs pretrained with a large set of images. Here
we reveal that, what matters is the network structure instead of the trained
weights. Without any learning, the structure of a deep network is sufficient to
capture the dependencies between multiple levels of variable statistics using
multiple layers of CNNs. This insight removes the requirements of pre-training
and a particular network structure (commonly, VGG) that are previously assumed
for the perceptual loss, thus enabling a significantly wider range of
applications. To this end, we demonstrate that a randomly-weighted deep CNN can
be used to model the structured dependencies of outputs. On a few dense
per-pixel prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation and
instance segmentation, we show improved results of using the extended
randomized perceptual loss, compared to the baselines using pixel-wise loss
alone. We hope that this simple, extended perceptual loss may serve as a
generic structured-output loss that is applicable to most structured output

change the angular momentum of the nucleus, potentially leading to rotational
instability. Here, we use empirical measures of spin changes in a sample of
comets to characterize the torques and to compare them with expectations from a
simple model. Both the data and the model show that the characteristic spin-up
timescale, $\tau_s$, is a strong function of nucleus radius, $r_n$.
Empirically, we find that the timescale for comets (most with perihelion 1 to 2
AU and eccentricity $\sim$0.5) varies as $\tau_s \sim 100 r_n^{2}$, where $r_n$
is expressed in kilometers and $\tau_s$ is in years. The fraction of the
nucleus surface that is active varies as $f_A \sim 0.1 r_n^{-2}$. We find that
the median value of the dimensionless moment arm of the torque is $k_T$ = 0.007
(i.e. $\sim$0.7\% of the escaping momentum torques the nucleus), with weak
($<$3$\sigma$) evidence for a size dependence $k_T \sim 10^{-3} r_n^2$.
Sub-kilometer nuclei have spin-up timescales comparable to their orbital
periods, confirming that outgassing torques are quickly capable of driving
small nuclei towards rotational disruption. Torque-induced rotational
instability likely accounts for the paucity of sub-kilometer short-period
cometary nuclei, and for the pre-perihelion destruction of sungrazing comets.
Torques from sustained outgassing on small active asteroids can rival YORP
torques, even for very small ($\lesssim$1 g s$^{-1}$) mass loss rates. Finally,
we highlight the important role played by observational biases in the measured
distributions of $\tau_s$, $f_A$ and $k_T$.

that only represent the mean hydrodynamic force acting upon a particle-laden
suspension. Consequently, higher-order drag force statistics, arising from
neighbor-induced flow perturbations, are not accounted for; with implications
on predictions for particle velocity variance and dispersion. We develop a
force Langevin (FL) model that treats neighbor-induced drag fluctuations as a
stochastic force within an EL framework. The stochastic drag force follows an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and requires closure of the integral time scale for
the fluctuating hydrodynamic force and the standard deviation in drag. The
former is closed using the mean-free time between successive collisions,
derived from the kinetic theory of non-uniform gases. For the latter,
particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (PR--DNS) of fixed particle
assemblies is utilized to develop a correlation. The stochastic EL framework
specifies unresolved drag force statistics, leading to the correct evolution
and sustainment of particle velocity variance over a wide range of Reynolds
numbers and solids volume fractions when compared to PR--DNS of freely-evolving
homogeneous suspensions. By contrast, standard EL infers drag statistics from
variations in the resolved flow and thus under-predicts the growth and steady
particle velocity variance in homogeneous suspensions. Velocity statistics from
standard EL approaches are found to depend on the bandwidth of the projection
function used for two-way momentum coupling, while results obtained from the
stochastic EL approach are insensitive to the projection bandwidth.

where the model parameters are adapted to samples. The key insight is that
adapting model across domains is achieved via adapting model across samples.
Thus, it breaks down source domain barriers and turns multi-source domains into
a single-source domain. This also simplifies the alignment between source and
target domains, as it only requires the target domain to be aligned with any
part of the union of source domains. Furthermore, we find dynamic transfer can
be simply modeled by aggregating residual matrices and a static convolution
matrix. Experimental results show that, without using domain labels, our
dynamic transfer outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 3% on the

neural network models trained on large simulation databases and partially

(PSCC-Net) to detect and localize image manipulations. PSCC-Net processes the
image in a two-path procedure: a top-down path that extracts local and global
features and a bottom-up path that detects whether the input image is
manipulated, and estimates its manipulation masks at multiple scales, where
each mask is conditioned on the previous one. Different from the conventional
encoder-decoder and no-pooling structures, PSCC-Net leverages features at
different scales with dense cross-connections to produce manipulation masks in
a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, a Spatio-Channel Correlation Module (SCCM)
captures both spatial and channel-wise correlations in the bottom-up path,
which endows features with holistic cues, enabling the network to cope with a
wide range of manipulation attacks. Thanks to the light-weight backbone and
progressive mechanism, PSCC-Net can process 1,080P images at 50+ FPS. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of PSCC-Net over the state-of-the-art

parameter, a semiparametric formulation of this problem poses daunting
challenges, both methodologically and theoretically, as (i) the number of local
extrema may be unknown, and (ii) the induced shape constraints associated with
local extrema are highly irregular. In this article, we build upon a
derivative-constrained Gaussian process prior recently proposed by Yu et al.

accounts for multi-modality. Point and interval estimates of local extrema with

promising performance on visual tracking tasks thanks to their superior
computational efficiency and reliable similarity metric learning, respectively.
However, how to effectively take advantages of powerful deep networks, while
maintaining the real-time response of DCF, remains a challenging problem.
Embedding the cross-correlation operator as a separate layer into siamese
networks is a popular choice to enhance the tracking accuracy. Being a key
component of such a network, the correlation layer is updated online together
with other parts of the network. Yet, when facing serious disturbance, fused
trackers may still drift away from the target completely due to accumulated
errors. To address these issues, we propose a coarse-to-fine tracking
framework, which roughly infers the target state via an online-updating DCF
module first and subsequently, finely locates the target through an
offline-training asymmetric siamese network (ASN). Benefitting from the
guidance of DCF and the learned channel weights obtained through exploiting the
given ground-truth template, ASN refines feature representation and implements
precise target localization. Systematic experiments on five popular tracking
datasets demonstrate that the proposed DCF-ASN achieves the state-of-the-art

Many machine-learning-based HSI super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been

approaches is that they are highly dependent on image and camera settings and
can only learn to map an input HSI with one specific setting to an output HSI
with another. However, different cameras capture images with different spectral
response functions and bands numbers due to the diversity of HSI cameras.
Consequently, the existing machine-learning-based approaches fail to learn to
super-resolve HSIs for a wide variety of input-output band settings. We propose
a single Meta-Learning-Based Super-Resolution (MLSR) model, which can take in
HSI images at an arbitrary number of input bands' peak wavelengths and generate

Landau-Lifshitz equation is known to support steady-state solutions, termed
dissipative exchange flows (DEFs) or spin superfluids. In this work, by means
of numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we provide a full
description of the injection-induced, large-amplitude, nonlinear magnetization
dynamics up to the steady state. The dynamics prior to reaching steady state
are driven by spin injection, the perpendicular applied magnetic field, the
exchange interaction, and local demagnetizing fields. We show that the dynamics
take well-defined profiles in the form of rarefaction waves (RW), dispersive
shock waves (DSW), and solitons. The combination of these building blocks
depends on the interplay between the spin injection strength and the applied
magnetic field. A solitonic feature at the injection boundary, signaling the
onset of the magnetic ""supersonic"" condition at the injection edge, rapidly
develops and persists in the steady-state configuration of a contact soliton
DEF. We also demonstrate the existence of sustained soliton-train dynamics in
long time that can only arise in a nonzero applied magnetic field scenario. The
dynamical evolution of spin-injection-induced magnetization dynamics presented
here may help guide observations in long-distance spin transport experiments.

generation nuclear fuels. Using X-ray computed tomography (CT) to characterize
TRISO particles is challenging because of the strong attenuation of the X-ray
beam by the uranium core leading to severe photon starvation in a substantial
fraction of the measurements. Furthermore, the overall acquisition time for a
high-resolution CT scan can be very long when using conventional lab-based
X-ray systems and reconstruction algorithms. Specifically, when analytic
methods like the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm is used for
reconstruction, it results in severe streaks artifacts and noise in the
corresponding 3D volume which make subsequent analysis of the particles
challenging. In this article, we develop and apply model-based image

reconstructions for TRISO particles in order to facilitate better
characterization. We demonstrate that the proposed MBIR algorithms can
significantly suppress artifacts with minimal pre-processing compared to the

can obtain high-quality reconstruction compared to the FDK approach even when

enabled the use of deep learning-based computer vision techniques for automated

challenges. WSIs are gigapixel-sized ($\sim$100K pixels), making them
infeasible to be used directly for training deep neural networks. Also, often
only slide-level labels are available for training as detailed annotations are
tedious and can be time-consuming for experts. Approaches using
multiple-instance learning (MIL) frameworks have been shown to overcome these
challenges. Current state-of-the-art approaches divide the learning framework
into two decoupled parts: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for encoding the
patches followed by an independent aggregation approach for slide-level
prediction. In this approach, the aggregation step has no bearing on the
representations learned by the CNN encoder. We have proposed an end-to-end
framework that clusters the patches from a WSI into ${k}$-groups, samples
${k}'$ patches from each group for training, and uses an adaptive attention
mechanism for slide level prediction; Cluster-to-Conquer (C2C). We have
demonstrated that dividing a WSI into clusters can improve the model training
by exposing it to diverse discriminative features extracted from the patches.
We regularized the clustering mechanism by introducing a KL-divergence loss
between the attention weights of patches in a cluster and the uniform
distribution. The framework is optimized end-to-end on slide-level
cross-entropy, patch-level cross-entropy, and KL-divergence loss

distance profiles of caches in multicores. SASMM relies on a stochastic, static
basic block-level analysis of reuse profiles. The profiles are calculated from

this approach, the Boltzmann equation for polarized photons is rewritten in a
line-of-sight integral along an exact geodesic in the perturbed universe,
rather than a geodesic in the background universe used in the linear-order CMB
calculation. This approach resolves the difficulty to solve the Boltzmann
hierarchy with the nonlinear gravitational effects in the photon free-streaming
regime and thus unifies the standard remapping approach for CMB lensing into
the direct approach solving the Boltzmann equation for the nonlinear
collisional effects. In this paper, we derive formulae that: (i) include all
the nonlinear effects; (ii) can treat extended sources such as the
contributions after the reionization. It offers a solid framework to discuss
possible systematics in the standard estimation of CMB lensing by the remapping
approach. As an explicit demonstration, we estimate the secondary B-mode power
spectrum induced by all foreground gravitational effects: lensing, redshift,
time-delay, emission-angle, and polarization-rotation effects. We define these
effects properly so that they do not have any overlap, also without overlooking
any effect. Then, we show that these effects only give corrections of the order

an agent from an initial state to a goal state. In robotics, this is
particularly difficult because actions usually have several possible results,
and sensors are prone to produce measurements with error. Partially observable
Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are commonly employed, thanks to their
capacity to model the uncertainty of actions that modify and monitor the state
of a system. However, since solving a POMDP is computationally expensive, their
usage becomes prohibitive for most robotic applications. In this paper, we
propose a task planning architecture for service robotics. In the context of
service robot design, we present a scheme to encode knowledge about the robot
and its environment, that promotes the modularity and reuse of information.
Also, we introduce a new recursive definition of a POMDP that enables our
architecture to autonomously build a hierarchy of POMDPs, so that it can be
used to generate and execute plans that solve the task at hand. Experimental
results show that, in comparison to baseline methods, by following a recursive
hierarchical approach the architecture is able to significantly reduce the
planning time, while maintaining (or even improving) the robustness under
several scenarios that vary in uncertainty and size.

multi-scale features in object detection. However, current FPN-based methods

the loss of semantical information. And the miscellaneous fused feature maps
may cause serious aliasing effects. In this paper, we present a novel channel
enhancement feature pyramid network (CE-FPN) with three simple yet effective
modules to alleviate these problems. Specifically, inspired by sub-pixel
convolution, we propose a sub-pixel skip fusion method to perform both channel
enhancement and upsampling. Instead of the original 1x1 convolution and linear
upsampling, it mitigates the information loss due to channel reduction. Then we
propose a sub-pixel context enhancement module for extracting more feature
representations, which is superior to other context methods due to the
utilization of rich channel information by sub-pixel convolution. Furthermore,
a channel attention guided module is introduced to optimize the final
integrated features on each level, which alleviates the aliasing effect only
with a few computational burdens. Our experiments show that CE-FPN achieves
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art FPN-based detectors on MS

problem in queueing theory. The Gittins index policy is known to be the optimal
preemptive nonanticipating policy (both for the open version of the problem
with Poisson arrivals and the closed version without arrivals) minimizing the
expected holding costs. While the Gittins index is thoroughly characterized for
ordinary jobs whose state is described by the attained service, it is not at
all the case with jobs that have more complex structure. Recently, a class of
such jobs, the multistage jobs, were introduced, and it was shown that the
computation of Gittins index of a multistage job reduces into separable
computations for the individual stages. The characterization is, however,
indirect in the sense that it relies on the recursion for an auxiliary function
(so called SJP function) and not for the Gittins index itself. In this paper,
we answer the natural question: Is it possible to compute the Gittins index for
a multistage job more directly by recursively combining the Gittins indexes of
its individual stages? According to our results, it seems to be possible, at
least, for sequential multistage jobs that have a fixed (deterministic)
sequence of stages. We prove this for sequential two-stage jobs that have
monotonous hazard rates in both stages, but our numerical experiments give an
indication that the result could possibly be generalized to any sequential
multistage jobs. Our approach, in this paper, is based on the Whittle index
originally developed in the context of restless bandits.

been extensively studied in itinerant magnets; in contrast to the conventional
ones induced, e.g., by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in
noncentrosymmetric systems, they are characterized by extremely short magnetic
periods and stable even in centrosymmetric systems. Here we review such new
types of topological spin textures with particular emphasis on their
stabilization mechanism. Focusing on the interplay between charge and spin
degrees of freedom in itinerant electron systems, we show that itinerant
frustration, which is the competition among electron-mediated interactions,
plays a central role in stabilizing a variety of topological spin crystals
including a skyrmion crystal with unconventional high skyrmion number, meron
crystals, and hedgehog crystals. We also show that the essential ingredients in
the itinerant frustration are represented by bilinear and biquadratic spin
interactions in momentum space. This perspective not only provides a unified
understanding of the unconventional topological spin crystals but also
stimulates further exploration of exotic topological phenomena in itinerant
magnets.

It has been so far unclear whether a convergent series expansion can be
provided by the gravitational lens approach based on the geometrical optics for
obtaining approximate solutions in the strong deflection limit in terms of a
small offset angle. By using the ratio of the lens mass to the lens distance,
we discuss a slightly different method for iterative solutions and the behavior
of the convergence. Finite distance effects begin at the third order in the
iterative method. The iterative solutions in the strong deflection limit are
estimated for Sgr $A^{*}$ and M87. These results suggest that only the linear
order solution can be relevant with current observations, while the finite
distance effects at the third order may be negligible in the Schwarzschild lens

Specifically, we address the weighted average sum rate maximization problem
with quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. In particular, to facilitate fast
resource scheduling, we focus on developing a very low-complexity algorithm. To
this end, by leveraging Lagrangian duality and the stochastic optimization
theory, we first develop an opportunistic MC-NOMA scheduling algorithm whereby
the original problem is decomposed into a series of subproblems, one for each
time slot. Accordingly, resource scheduling works in an online manner by
solving one subproblem per time slot, making it more applicable to practical
systems. Then, we further develop a heuristic joint subchannel assignment and
power allocation (Joint-SAPA) algorithm with very low computational complexity,
called Joint-SAPA-LCC, that solves each subproblem. Finally, through
simulation, we show that our Joint-SAPA-LCC algorithm provides good performance
comparable to the existing Joint-SAPA algorithms despite requiring much lower
computational complexity. We also demonstrate that our opportunistic MC-NOMA
scheduling algorithm in which the Joint-SAPA-LCC algorithm is embedded works
well while satisfying given QoS requirements.

especially on how realistic such threats are and how general existing
protection could be. In this paper, we present our systematization of knowledge
for ASR security and provide a comprehensive taxonomy for existing work based
on a modularized workflow. More importantly, we align the research in this
domain with that on security in Image Recognition System (IRS), which has been
extensively studied, using the domain knowledge in the latter to help
understand where we stand in the former. Generally, both IRS and ASR are
perceptual systems. Their similarities allow us to systematically study
existing literature in ASR security based on the spectrum of attacks and
defense solutions proposed for IRS, and pinpoint the directions of more
advanced attacks and the directions potentially leading to more effective
protection in ASR. In contrast, their differences, especially the complexity of
ASR compared with IRS, help us learn unique challenges and opportunities in ASR
security. Particularly, our experimental study shows that transfer learning
across ASR models is feasible, even in the absence of knowledge about models

the axial anomaly and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and only a minor
modification of that argument is sufficient to show the APS index theorem. The
key ingredient is the identification of the APS boundary condition and its
generalization as physical state vectors in the Hilbert space of the massless
fermion theory. The APS $\eta$-invariant appears as the axial charge of the

subspace clustering approaches to data on a union of nonlinear manifolds. In
this comparative study, we provide a comprehensive overview of nonlinear

important artifacts to help developers in software maintenance. However, the
comments are mostly missing or are outdated, specially in complex software
projects. As a result, several automatic comment generation models are
developed as a solution. The recent models explore the integration of external
knowledge resources such as Unified Modeling Language class diagrams to improve
the generated comments. In this paper, we propose API2Com, a model that
leverages the Application Programming Interface Documentations (API Docs) as a
knowledge resource for comment generation. The API Docs include the description
of the methods in more details and therefore, can provide better context in the
generated comments. The API Docs are used along with the code snippets and
Abstract Syntax Trees in our model. We apply the model on a large Java dataset
of over 130,000 methods and evaluate it using both Transformer and RNN-base
architectures. Interestingly, when API Docs are used, the performance increase
is negligible. We therefore run different experiments to reason about the
results. For methods that only contain one API, adding API Docs improves the
results by 4% BLEU score on average (BLEU score is an automatic evaluation
metric used in machine translation). However, as the number of APIs that are
used in a method increases, the performance of the model in generating comments
decreases due to long documentations used in the input. Our results confirm
that the API Docs can be useful in generating better comments, but, new
techniques are required to identify the most informative ones in a method
rather than using all documentations simultaneously.

DML task which learns the metric between pictures, we treat each pixel as a
sample, and use their embedded features in high-dimensional space to form
triples, then we tend to force the distance between pixels of different
categories greater than of the same category by optimizing IS-Triplet loss so
that the pixels from different categories are easier to be distinguished in the
high-dimensional feature space. We further present an efficient triple sampling
strategy to make a feasible computation of IS-Triplet loss. Finally, the
IS-Triplet loss is combined with 3 traditional image segmentation losses to
perform image segmentation. We apply the proposed approach to image
co-segmentation and test it on the SBCoseg dataset and the Internet dataset.
The experimental result shows that our approach can effectively improve the
discrimination of pixels' categories in high-dimensional space and thus help

redshift, detected in absorption in the spectra of quasars. We present four new
identifications of HD lines associated with known $\rm H_2$-bearing Damped
Lyman-$\alpha$ systems. In addition, we measure upper limits on the $\rm HD$
column density in twelve recently identified $\rm H_2$-bearing DLAs. We find
that the new $\rm HD$ detections have similar $N({\rm HD})/N(\rm H_2)$ ratios
as previously found, further strengthening a marked difference with
measurements through the Galaxy. This is likely due to differences in physical
conditions and metallicity between the local and the high-redshift interstellar
media. Using the measured $N({\rm HD})/N({\rm H_2})$ ratios together with
priors on the UV flux ($\chi$) and number densities ($n$), obtained from
analysis of $\rm H_2$ and associated CI lines, we are able to constrain the
cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR, $\zeta$) for the new $\rm HD$ detections and
for eight known HD-bearing systems where priors on $n$ and $\chi$ are
available. We find significant dispersion in $\zeta$, from a few $\times
10^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$ to a few $\times 10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$. We also find that
$\zeta$ strongly correlates with $\chi$ -- showing almost quadratic dependence,
slightly correlates with $Z$, and does not correlate with $n$, which probably
reflects a physical connection between cosmic rays and star-forming regions.

autonomous vehicles. To make a lightweight the algorithm, most SLAM systems
rely on feature detection from images for vision SLAM or point cloud for
laser-based methods. Feature detection through a 3D point cloud becomes a
computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a feature detection
method by projecting a 3D point cloud to form an image and apply the
vision-based feature detection technique. The proposed method gives repeatable
and stable features in a variety of environments. Based on such features, we
build a 6-DOF SLAM system consisting of tracking, mapping, and loop closure
threads. For loop detection, we employ a 2-step approach i.e. nearest
key-frames detection and loop candidate verification by matching features
extracted from rasterized LIDAR images. Furthermore, we utilize a key-frame
structure to achieve a lightweight SLAM system. The proposed system is
evaluated with implementation on the KITTI dataset and the University of
Michigan Ford Campus dataset. Through experimental results, we show that the

giving accurate results.

autonomous driving. However, the low sample efficiency and difficulty of
designing reward functions for DRL would hinder its applications in practice.
In light of this, this paper proposes a novel framework to incorporate human
prior knowledge in DRL, in order to improve the sample efficiency and save the
effort of designing sophisticated reward functions. Our framework consists of
three ingredients, namely expert demonstration, policy derivation, and
reinforcement learning. In the expert demonstration step, a human expert
demonstrates their execution of the task, and their behaviors are stored as
state-action pairs. In the policy derivation step, the imitative expert policy
is derived using behavioral cloning and uncertainty estimation relying on the
demonstration data. In the reinforcement learning step, the imitative expert
policy is utilized to guide the learning of the DRL agent by regularizing the
KL divergence between the DRL agent's policy and the imitative expert policy.
To validate the proposed method in autonomous driving applications, two
simulated urban driving scenarios (unprotected left turn and roundabout) are
designed. The strengths of our proposed method are manifested by the training
results as our method can not only achieve the best performance but also
significantly improve the sample efficiency in comparison with the baseline
algorithms (particularly 60\% improvement compared to soft actor-critic). In
testing conditions, the agent trained by our method obtains the highest success
rate and shows diverse and human-like driving behaviors as demonstrated by the
human expert.

of the characteristics of speculative execution to trap the execution of the
victim application in an infinite loop, enabling the attacker to amplify a
side-channel attack by executing it indefinitely. Due to the nature of the
replay, it can be used to effectively attack security critical trusted
execution environments (secure enclaves), even under conditions where a
side-channel attack would not be possible. At the same time, unlike speculative
side-channel attacks, MicroScope can be used to amplify the correct path of
execution, rendering many existing speculative side-channel defences
ineffective.
  In this work, we generalize microarchitectural replay attacks beyond
MicroScope and present an efficient defence against them. We make the
observation that such attacks rely on repeated squashes of so-called ""replay

same reorder buffer window as the handles. We propose Delay-on-Squash, a
technique for tracking squashed instructions and preventing them from being

attention due to its important practical significance. Models based on deep

Autoencoder (VAE) have shown the unique advantage in collaborative filtering.
In particular, the sequential VAE model as a recurrent version of VAE can
effectively capture temporal dependencies among items in user sequence and
perform sequential recommendation. However, VAE-based models suffer from a
common limitation that the representational ability of the obtained approximate
posterior distribution is limited, resulting in lower quality of generated
samples. This is especially true for generating sequences. To solve the above

Specifically, we first introduce the adversarial training for sequence

enables our model to generate high-quality latent variables. Then, we employ
the contrastive loss. The latent variables will be able to learn more
personalized and salient characteristics by minimizing the contrastive loss.
Besides, when encoding the sequence, we apply a recurrent and convolutional
structure to capture global and local relationships in the sequence. Finally,
we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental

propose a model to quantify the user context and provide semantic contextual
reasoning. A diagnostic belief algorithm (DBA) is also presented that
identifies a given event and also computes the confidence of the decision as a
function of available resources, premises, exceptions, and desired specificity.
We conduct an empirical study in the domain of day-to-day routine queries and
the experimental results show that the answer to queries and also its

  Surrogates","17 pages",,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  An increasingly popular method for solving a constrained combinatorial
optimisation problem is to first convert it into a quadratic unconstrained
binary optimisation (QUBO) problem, and solve it using a standard QUBO solver.
However, this relaxation introduces hyper-parameters that balance the objective
and penalty terms for the constraints, and their chosen values significantly
impact performance. Hence, tuning these parameters is an important problem.
Existing generic hyper-parameter tuning methods require multiple expensive
calls to a QUBO solver, making them impractical for performance critical
applications when repeated solutions of similar combinatorial optimisation
problems are required. In this paper, we propose the QROSS method, in which we
build surrogate models of QUBO solvers via learning from solver data on a
collection of instances of a problem. In this way, we are able capture the
common structure of the instances and their interactions with the solver, and
produce good choices of penalty parameters with fewer number of calls to the
QUBO solver. We take the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study,
where we demonstrate that our method can find better solutions with fewer calls
to QUBO solver compared with conventional hyper-parameter tuning techniques.
Moreover, with simple adaptation methods, QROSS is shown to generalise well to
out-of-distribution datasets and different types of QUBO solvers.

tasks. Their hard inductive biases enable sample-efficient learning, but come
at the cost of a potentially lower performance ceiling. Vision Transformers
(ViTs) rely on more flexible self-attention layers, and have recently
outperformed CNNs for image classification. However, they require costly
pre-training on large external datasets or distillation from pre-trained
convolutional networks. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it
possible to combine the strengths of these two architectures while avoiding
their respective limitations? To this end, we introduce gated positional
self-attention (GPSA), a form of positional self-attention which can be
equipped with a ``soft"" convolutional inductive bias. We initialise the GPSA
layers to mimic the locality of convolutional layers, then give each attention
head the freedom to escape locality by adjusting a gating parameter regulating
the attention paid to position versus content information. The resulting
convolutional-like ViT architecture, ConViT, outperforms the DeiT on ImageNet,
while offering a much improved sample efficiency. We further investigate the
role of locality in learning by first quantifying how it is encouraged in
vanilla self-attention layers, then analysing how it is escaped in GPSA layers.
We conclude by presenting various ablations to better understand the success of
the ConViT. Our code and models are released publicly at

high-speed flight is very challenging. In this paper, we ask the following
questions: How sensitive are controllers to tuning when tracking high-speed
maneuvers? What algorithms can we use to automatically tune them? To answer the
first question, we study the relationship between parameters and performance
and find out that the faster the maneuver, the more sensitive a controller
becomes to its parameters. To answer the second question, we review existing
methods for controller tuning and discover that prior works often perform
poorly on the task of high-speed flight. Therefore, we propose AutoTune, a
sampling-based tuning algorithm specifically tailored to high-speed flight. In
contrast to previous work, our algorithm does not assume any prior knowledge of
the drone or its optimization function and can deal with the multi-modal
characteristics of the parameters' optimization space. We thoroughly evaluate
AutoTune both in simulation and in the physical world. In our experiments, we
outperform existing tuning algorithms by up to 90% in trajectory completion.
The resulting controllers are tested in the AirSim Game of Drones competition,

gauge-inequivalent solutions to the Friedman equations onto each other. In this
work, we provide a unified treatment of this hidden conformal symmetry and its

Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model, the (A)dS cosmology and provide a first

realizations of this symmetry while recovering previous results in a unified

semantics. Differently from Dung's complete semantics, weakly complete
semantics employs a mechanism called undecidedness blocking by which the label
undecided of an attacking argument is not always propagated to an otherwise
accepted attacked argument. The new semantics are conflict-free, non-admissible
but employing a weaker notion of admissibility; they allow reinstatement and
they retain the majority of properties of complete semantics. We show how both
weakly complete and Dung's complete semantics can be generated by applying
different undecidedness blocking strategies, making undecidedness blocking a
unifying mechanism underlying argumentation semantics. The semantics are also
an example of ambiguity blocking Dunganian semantics and the first semantics to
tackle the problem of self-defeating attacking arguments. In the last part of
the paper we compare weakly complete semantics with the recent work of Baumann
et al. on weakly admissible semantics. Since the two families of semantics do
not coincide, a principle-based analysis of the two approaches is provided. The
analysis shows how our semantics satisfy a number of principles satisfied by
Dung's complete semantics but not by Baumann et al. semantics, including
directionality, abstention, SCC-decomposability and cardinality of extensions,
making them a more faithful non-admissible version of Dung' semantics.

natural language referred objects in videos. It essentially requires semantic
comprehension and fine-grained video understanding. Existing methods introduce
language representation into segmentation models in a bottom-up manner, which
merely conducts vision-language interaction within local receptive fields of
ConvNets. We argue that such interaction is not fulfilled since the model can
barely construct region-level relationships given partial observations, which
is contrary to the description logic of natural language/referring expressions.
In fact, people usually describe a target object using relations with other
objects, which may not be easily understood without seeing the whole video. To
address the issue, we introduce a novel top-down approach by imitating how we
human segment an object with the language guidance. We first figure out all
candidate objects in videos and then choose the refereed one by parsing
relations among those high-level objects. Three kinds of object-level relations
are investigated for precise relationship understanding, i.e., positional
relation, text-guided semantic relation, and temporal relation. Extensive
experiments on A2D Sentences and J-HMDB Sentences show our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Qualitative results also show our

to form preferentially at the grain boundaries, rather than in the grain
interiors. We find that in Ga-rich growth conditions Cu vacancies as well as Ga
at Cu and Cu at Ga antisites are mainly responsible for having the equilibrium
Fermi level pinned toward the middle of the gap, resulting in carrier
depletion. The Na at Cu impurity in its +1 charge state contributes to this. In
Ga-poor growth conditions, on the other hand, the formation energies of Cu
vacancies and Ga at Cu antisites are comparatively too high for any significant
influence on carrier density or on the equilibrium Fermi level position. Thus,
under these conditions, the Cu at Ga antisites give rise to a $p$-type grain
boundary. Also, their formation energy is lower than the formation energy of Na
at Cu impurities. Thus, the latter will fail to act as a hole barrier
preventing recombination at the grain boundary, in contrast to what occurs in
CuInSe$_2$ grain boundaries. We also discuss the effect of the defects on the
electronic properties of bulk CuGaSe$_2$, which we assume reflect the
properties of the grain interiors.

is shown that for the in-plane polarization of the spin current, the DW

current with the densities below the Walker breakdown does not excite the

velocity increases linearly with increasing the current density. In this

intermediate coupling regime of the triangular lattice Hubbard model. Here we
provide a simple picture for its origin in terms of a Bosonic RVB description.
More specifically, we show that such a chiral spin liquid state can be
understood as a quantum disordered tetrahedral spin state stabilized by the
four spin ring exchange coupling, which suppresses the order-by-disorder effect
toward a stripy spin state. Such a chiral spin liquid state features a spin
Berry phase of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ per triangle. However, we show that the
topological property of such a state is totally missed in the Schwinger Boson
mean field description as a result of the lack of Boson rigidity caused by the
no double occupancy constraint.

clinicians with 3D, quantitative and high-resolution information of both soft
and hard tissues such as the breast or the adult human brain. Their practical
application requires accurate modelling of the acquisition setup: the spatial
location, orientation, and impulse response of each ultrasound transducer.
However, existing calibration methods fail to accurately characterise these
transducers unless their size can be considered negligible when compared to the
dominant wavelength, which reduces signal-to-noise ratios below usable levels
in the presence of high-contrast tissues such as the skull. In this paper, we
introduce a methodology that can simultaneously estimate the location,
orientation, and impulse response of the ultrasound transducers in a single
calibration. We do this by extending spatial response identification, an
algorithm that we have recently proposed to estimate transducer impulse
responses. Our proposed methodology replaces the transducers in the acquisition
device with a surrogate model whose effective response matches the experimental
data by fitting a numerical model of wave propagation. This results in a
flexible and robust calibration procedure that can accurately predict the
behaviour of the ultrasound acquisition device without ever having to know
where the real transducers are or their individual impulse response.
Experimental results using a ring acquisition system show that spatial response
identification produces calibrations of significantly higher quality than
standard methodologies across all transducers, both in transmission and in
reception. Experimental full-waveform inversion reconstructions of a
tissue-mimicking phantom demonstrate that spatial response identification
generates more accurate reconstructions than those produced with standard
calibration techniques.

actuators exist, past research has focused primarily on designing and analyzing
single components. Limited effort has been made to combine each component to
create an overall capable, integrated soft robot. Ideally, the behavior of such
a robot can be accurately modeled, and its motion within an environment uses
its proprioception, without requiring external sensors. This work presents a
design and modeling process for a Soft continuum Proprioceptive Arm (SoPrA)
actuated by pneumatics. The integrated design is suitable for an analytical
model due to its internal capacitive flex sensor for proprioceptive
measurements and its fiber-reinforced fluidic elastomer actuators. The proposed
analytical dynamical model accounts for the inertial effects of the actuator's
mass and the material properties, and predicts in real-time the soft robot's
behavior. Our estimation method integrates the analytical model with
proprioceptive sensors to calculate external forces, all without relying on an
external motion capture system. SoPrA is validated in a series of experiments
demonstrating the model's and sensor's accuracy in estimation. SoPrA will
enable soft arm manipulation including force sensing while operating in
obstructed environments that disallows exteroceptive measurements.

Multilingual LMs are substantially less effective in resource-lean scenarios

compartments requires the development of specific techniques. We propose a
technique based on molecular rotors-viscosity-sensitive fluorescent probes-to
evaluate the above key point. DASPI molecular rotor has been identified with
spectral fluorescence properties decoupled from those of hemoglobin, the main
component of the cytosol. After validation of the rotor as a viscosity probe in
model fluids, we showed by confocal microscopy that, in addition to binding to
the membrane, the rotor penetrates spontaneously and uniformly into red blood
cells. Experiments conducted on temperature-stiffened red blood cells show that
molecular rotors can probe their overall rigidity. A simple model allowed us to
separate the contribution of the cytosol from that of the membrane, providing a
quantification of cytosol rigidification with temperature, consistent with
independent measurements of the viscosity of hemoglobin solutions. Our
experiments demonstrate that the rotor can be used to quantify the
intracellular rheology of red blood cells at the cellular level, as well as the
heterogeneity of this stiffness in a blood sample. This technique opens up new

shift, the model trained with one of the three scenarios in SCD has poor
generalization ability when applied to the rest scenarios. To solve this

method can keep the context relationship of foreground objects and backgrounds
unchanged and greatly augment the target datasets. We firstly propose a surface
segmentation algorithm to achieve texture decoupling of each instance.
Secondly, a contour reconstruction algorithm is proposed to keep the occlusion

fusion algorithm is used to replace the foreground texture from the source

in anisotropic media, refraction is a much more exotic phenomenon. The most
general case of refraction between two anisotropic media remains unexplored,
particularly in natural media and at the nanoscale. Here, we visualize and
comprehensively study refraction of electromagnetic waves between two strongly
anisotropic (hyperbolic) media, and, importantly, we do it with the use of
polaritons confined to the nanoscale in a low-loss natural medium, alpha-MoO3.
Our images show refraction of polaritons under the general case in which both
the direction of propagation and the wavevector are not collinear. As they
traverse planar nanoprisms tailored in alpha-MoO3, refracted polaritons exhibit
non-intuitive directions of propagation, enabling us to unveil an exotic
optical effect: bending-free refraction. Furthermore, we succeed in developing
the first in-plane refractive hyperlens, which yields foci as small as
lamdap/6, being lamdap the polariton wavelength (lamda0/50 with respect to the

suitable for offline learning and cannot continually learn from sequential
streaming data. The sequential data comes in the form of tasks during training.
Recently, a few attempts have been made to handle this issue and develop
continual ZSL (CZSL) methods. However, these CZSL methods require clear
task-boundary information between the tasks during training, which is not
practically possible. This paper proposes a task-free (i.e., task-agnostic)
CZSL method, which does not require any task information during continual
learning. The proposed task-free CZSL method employs a variational autoencoder
(VAE) for performing ZSL. To develop the CZSL method, we combine the concept of
experience replay with knowledge distillation and regularization. Here,
knowledge distillation is performed using the training sample's dark knowledge,
which essentially helps overcome the catastrophic forgetting issue. Further, it
is enabled for task-free learning using short-term memory. Finally, a
classifier is trained on the synthetic features generated at the latent space
of the VAE. Moreover, the experiments are conducted in a challenging and
practical ZSL setup, i.e., generalized ZSL (GZSL). These experiments are
conducted for two kinds of single-head continual learning settings: (i) mild
setting-: task-boundary is known only during training but not during testing;
(ii) strict setting-: task-boundary is not known at training, as well as
testing. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets exhibit the validity
of the approach for CZSL.

not only electric infrastructure destruction, but also the economic crisis
associated with damage to private and public activities. The full restoration
of the electric infrastructure is not always simultaneously performed with the
full restoration of electric production. Here, we describe the electric
production curves for the islands of Saint-Martin, Saint-Barthelemy, and Puerto
Rico in the Caribbean, where two major hurricanes occurred in 2017. After the
major hurricanes, the electric energy production was characterised by a slow
recovery followed by a stable phase during several months, corresponding to
approximately $75\%$ of the initial electric production. A resilience time of
several months (1 month $< t_s <$ 5 months) is necessary to attain the new
electric energy production equilibrium $E_{is}$, which is lower than the
initial electric energy production $E_i$. The reduction in electric energy
consumption per capita is of $20-25\%$. In Saint-Martin, during the
post-hurricane stable phase, the electric production was only approximately
$60\%$ of the initial electric energy production instead of $75\%$. The
reduction of 15 percent in the electric production of Saint-Martin after
Hurricane Irma could be attributed to the migration of approximately 8 000
inhabitants (approximately $23\%$) outside the island. This approach makes it
possible to anticipate the production of electricity during several months
after a major hurricane in the Caribbean islands.

actually require more general protocols based on higher-dimensional entangled

relaxations by reducing the problem to a non-commutative polynomial

diffusion materials under Green-Naghdi theory.
  First, we present the basic equations which characterize the bending of thin
thermoelastic diffusion plates for type II and III models. The theory allows
for the effect of transverse shear deformation without any shear correction
factor, and permits the propagation of waves at a finite speed without energy
dissipation for type II model and with energy dissipation for type III model.
By the semigroup theory of linear operators, we prove the well-posedness of the
both models and the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of type III model. For
unbounded plate of type III model, we prove that a measure associated with the
thermodynamic process decays faster than an exponential of a polynomial of
second degree.
  Finally, we investigate the impossibility of the localization in time of
solutions. The main idea to prove this result is to show the uniqueness of
solutions for the backward in-time problem.

over the course of their ""careers"" on the platform. We find that on average the
number of retweets received by users tends to increase over time. This is
partly expected because users tend to gradually accumulate followers.
Normalizing by the number of followers, however, reveals that the relative,
per-follower retweet rate tends to be non-monotonic, maximized at a ""peak age""
after which it does not increase, or even decreases. We develop a simple
mathematical model of the process behind this phenomenon, which assumes a
constantly growing number of followers, each of whom loses interest over time.
We show that this model is sufficient to explain the non-monotonic nature of
per-follower retweet rates, without any assumptions about the quality of

Internet-of-Things (IoT) integration -- termed as BIoT -- for more trust via
decentralization has led to great potentials in various use cases such as
health care, supply chain tracking, and smart cities. A key element of BIoT
ecosystems is the data transactions (TX) that include the data collected by IoT
devices. BIoT applications face many challenges to comply with the European
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) i.e., enabling users to hold on to
their rights for deleting or modifying their data stored on publicly accessible
and immutable BCs. In this regard, this paper identifies the requirements of
BCs for being GDPR compliant in BIoT use cases. Accordingly, an on-chain
solution is proposed that allows fine-grained modification (update and erasure)
operations on TXs' data fields within a BC. The proposed solution is based on a
cryptographic primitive called Chameleon Hashing. The novelty of this approach
is manifold. BC users have the authority to update their data, which are
addressed at the TX level with no side-effects on the block or chain. By
performing and storing the data updates, all on-chain, traceability and
verifiability of the BC are preserved. Moreover, the compatibility with TX
aggregation mechanisms that allow the compression of the BC size is maintained.

method (BSSM) to minimize the difference of two convex functions (DC
functions), where the first function is differentiable and the second one is
possibly non-smooth. Although the objective function is in general non-smooth,
under mild assumptions, the structure of the problem allows to prove that the
negative scaled generalized subgradient at the current iterate is a descent
direction from an auxiliary point. Therefore, instead of applying the Armijo
linear search and computing the next iterate from the current iterate, both the
linear search and the new iterate are computed from that auxiliary point along
the direction of the negative scaled generalized subgradient. As a consequence,
it is shown that the proposed method has similar asymptotic convergence
properties and iteration-complexity bounds as the usual descent methods to
minimize differentiable convex functions employing Armijo linear search.
Finally, for a suitable scale matrix the quadratic subproblems of BSSM have a
closed formula, and hence, the method has a better computational performance
than classical DC algorithms which must solve a convex (not necessarily
quadratic) subproblem.

the spectrum into one phase where the equilibirium expectation values of
physical observables crucially depend on this constant of motion, and another
phase where the energy is the only relevant thermodynamic magnitude. The
trademark feature of this operator is that it has two different eigenvalues,
$\pm1$, and therefore it acts as a discrete symmetry in the first of these two
phases. This scenario is observed in systems with and without an additional
discrete symmetry; in the first case, $\hat{\mathcal{C}}$ explains the change
from degenerate doublets to non-degenerate eigenlevels upon crossing the
critical line. We present stringent numerical evidence in the Rabi and Dicke
models, suggesting that this result is exact in the thermodynamic limit, with
finite-size corrections that decrease as a power-law.

Zero-Shot Learning task. However, it suffers severe generalization problem due
to lacking of feature diversity for unseen classes to train a good classifier.
In this paper, we propose to enhance the generalizability of GZSL models via
improving feature diversity of unseen classes. For this purpose, we present a
novel Diverse Feature Synthesis (DFS) model. Different from prior works that
solely utilize semantic knowledge in the generation process, DFS leverages
visual knowledge with semantic one in a unified way, thus deriving
class-specific diverse feature samples and leading to robust classifier for
recognizing both seen and unseen classes in the testing phase. To simplify the
learning, DFS represents visual and semantic knowledge in the aligned space,
making it able to produce good feature samples with a low-complexity
implementation. Accordingly, DFS is composed of two consecutive generators: an
aligned feature generator, transferring semantic and visual representations
into aligned features; a synthesized feature generator, producing diverse
feature samples of unseen classes in the aligned space. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to verify the efficacy of DFS. Results demonstrate
its effectiveness to generate diverse features for unseen classes, leading to
superior performance on multiple benchmarks. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

  Due to the nature of cross-spectral images, most correspondence solving
techniques for the visual domain are simply not applicable. Furthermore, most

the model directly ties the meta-atom position and geometry with the modal
reflection coefficients, enabling resolution of the detailed fabrication-ready
design by enforcement of the functionality constraints: elimination of the
fundamental $\mbox{TE}_{10}$ reflection and power conservation (passive
lossless MG). This reliable semianaltyical scheme, verified via full-wave
simulations and laboratory measurements, establishes a simple and efficient
alternative to common RWG MCs, typically requiring challenging deformation of
the WG designed through time-consuming full-wave optimization. In addition, it
highlights the immense potential MGs encompass for a wide variety of
applications beyond beam manipulation.

predict the intensity of undetected targets, and the density of targets
detected for the first time are approximated as Gaussian. Whereas conventional

intensity to vary over the region of interest with sharp edges around the
sensor's field of view, without using a large number of Gaussian mixture

In order to study the effect of cold rolling after intercritical annealing on

relevant for several potential applications, e.g. for optical coherence
elastography (OCE) for corneal biomechanical characterization. Larger
displacements may be resolved using correlation-based block matching
techniques, which however are prone to signal de-correlation and imprecise at
commonly desired sub-pixel resolutions. Phase-based tracking methods can
estimate tiny sub-wavelength motion, but are not suitable for motion magnitudes
larger than half the wavelength due to phase wrapping and the difficulty of any
unwrapping due to noise. In this paper a robust OCT displacement estimation
method is introduced by formulating tracking as an optimization problem that
jointly penalizes intensity disparity, phase difference, and motion
discontinuity. This is then solved using yynamic programming, utilizing both
sub-wavelength-scale phase and pixel-scale intensity information from OCT
imaging, while inherently seeking for the number of phase wraps. This allows
for effectively tracking axial and lateral displacements, respectively, with
sub-wavelength and pixel scale resolution. Results with tissue mimicking
phantoms show that our proposed approach substantially outperforms conventional
methods in terms of axial tracking precision, in particular for displacements
exceeding half the imaging wavelength.

functions unveils fractional effects since the number of particles in the unit

exploits low-rank and sparse decomposition (LSD) to dramatically reduce the

state-of-the-art decision-based methods under given imperceptibility
constraints. LSDAT crafts perturbations in the low-dimensional subspace formed
by the sparse component of the input sample and that of an adversarial sample
to obtain query-efficiency. The specific perturbation of interest is obtained
by traversing the path between the input and adversarial sparse components. It
is set forth that the proposed sparse perturbation is the most aligned sparse
perturbation with the shortest path from the input sample to the decision
boundary for some initial adversarial sample (the best sparse approximation of
shortest path, likely to fool the model). Theoretical analyses are provided to
justify the functionality of LSDAT. Unlike other dimensionality reduction based
techniques aimed at improving query efficiency (e.g, ones based on FFT), LSD
works directly in the image pixel domain to guarantee that non-$\ell_2$
constraints, such as sparsity, are satisfied. LSD offers better control over
the number of queries and provides computational efficiency as it performs
sparse decomposition of the input and adversarial images only once to generate
all queries. We demonstrate $\ell_0$, $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ bounded

attacks in diverse low-query budget scenarios as outlined in the experiments.

We propose Quality Evolvability ES, a method that simultaneously optimizes for

to find an archive of diverse and well-performing, but potentially genetically

adults tend to sleep better and have an earlier chronotype. But what happens
when we consider adolescents in a population where already adults have poor

studies in the city of Bariloche, Argentina aimed at measuring sleep quality,
chronotype, and social jet lag, using the Pittsburgh and Munich questionnaires.
These were administered individually to groups of high school students, as well
as to smaller samples of adults and preadolescents, in order to study
differences between adolescents and these groups. The results show that in this
population sleep quality is much poorer than in most other healthy populations
recorded elsewhere. Furthermore, sleep quality is consistently worse for
adolescents than for the other groups. The difference with adults seems to be
due mainly to increased daytime sleepiness and sleep latency, whereas the
difference with preadolescents seems to be due mainly to shorter sleep
duration. We also found that the chronotypes of all the groups are very late,
with a peak at an age between 18 and 24 ys. Social jet lag and sleep onset
latency are also large, and they peak at adolescence, which suggests that they

alternative human-in-the-loop strategies by using a combination of digital

VR interactions (human-controlled) and a declarative control where the human

graph product (the vertex-removing synchronised product (VRSP)), motivated by
applications in the context of synchronising periodic real-time processes. In
these applications, periodic real-time processes synchronise over actions that
have the same label and therefore the same behaviour. From a process-algebraic
point of view, such a synchronising action is executed atomically and at the
same time by all processes that have this action in their alphabet. But, when
these processes are executed on some computer platform, synchronisation leads
to context switches of the processes and therefore an increased overhead, which
may lead to deadline misses. But, by combining processes we reduce the number
of context switches and therefore reduce the overhead. We combine these
processes by representing the processes by edge-labelled acyclic directed
multi-graphs, and multiply the graphs by the VRSP. Next, we transpose the
resulting graphs into processes for which there are less context switches. An
important aspect of these real-time applications is that they must execute in
time. Still, it may happen that the set of processes of the application cannot
execute timely and may miss a deadline. Now, by decomposing the graphs and
multiplying the graphs by the VRSP in another combination, the processes that
are represented by these recombined graphs may execute in time. The
requirements of the recently introduced graph-decomposition theorems are too
strict and can be relaxed, whereby more graphs can be decomposed giving more
possible combinations for the real-time application. Therefore, we recall the
definition of the VRSP and the two graph-decomposition theorems, we relax the
requirements by stating and proving two lemmas and use these lemmas to state
and prove these two (relaxed) graph-decomposition theorems.

The encoder proposes keypoints and predicts activation strengths of edges

refines it into small point clouds with pointwise offsets. Then the activation
strengths are applied and the sub-clouds are merged. Composite Chamfer Distance
(CCD) is proposed as a distance between the input point cloud and the

on the modes supported by various cable types. However, so far the theory
disregards the fundamental surface wave mode whose lateral confinement
increases with frequency and hence is expected to play an important role in
high frequency applications. To address this issue, we propose an extension to
the theory which incorporates surface waves on uncoated, cylindrical wires.
Crucially, this requires new definitions of the per unit length transmission
line parameters which are derived using the single wire surface wave solution.
By closely examining a two wire and three wire system, we show that these new
parameters can predict surface waves as well as modes found using conventional
many conductor transmission line theory. Furthermore, all calculated modes are
validated experimentally by diagonalization of a measured channel transfer
matrix. Additionally, the theoretically predicted propagation constants for the
modes are validated against full numerical simulation for the two wire case and
good agreement is observed when proximity effects can be neglected.

nuclei. The early version of the interacting boson model of Arima and Iachello
has been foundational to the description of rotations in nuclei. The model is
based on a unitary spectrum generating algebra $U(6)$ and an orthogonal
(angular momentum) symmetry algebra $SO(3)$. A solvable limit of the model
contains $SU(3)$ in its dynamical symmetry chain. The corresponding Hamiltonian
is written as a linear combination of linear and quadratic Casimir invariants
of all the algebras in the chain. Prompted by these facts, a Hamiltonian
containing the $SU(3)$ quadratic Casimir squared is proposed to evaluate its
effects on rotational bands. The additional term yields three undetermined
parameters into the theory, which need be obtained from experiment. The lack of
data does not allow one to perform a detailed numerical analysis, but a rather
restricted one in terms of a one-parameter fit. Nevertheless, these additional
terms provide a good description of rotational bands of two nuclei of interest,
$^{156}\mathrm{Ga}$ and $^{234}\mathrm{U}$.

consequence, we aim at solving \emph{uniform} stabilization problems in which
the feedback is stabilizing for all possible switching sequences. In order to
generalize the solution obtained from trajectories to the actual system,
probabilistic guarantees on the obtained quadratic or SOS Lyapunov function are
derived in the spirit of scenario optimization. For the quadratic Lyapunov
technique, the generalization relies on a geometric analysis argument, while,
for the SOS Lyapunov technique, we follow a sensitivity analysis argument. In
order to deal with high-dimensional systems, we also develop parallelized
schemes for both techniques. We show that, with some modifications, the
data-driven quadratic Lyapunov technique can be extended to LQR control design.
Finally, the proposed data-driven control framework is demonstrated on several

in medical image analysis. Current models could be further improved, however,

incorporate this information into disease classification due to the high
reliance on clinician input in EHRs, limiting the possibility for automated

distillation} (VKD), which is a new probabilistic inference framework for
disease classification based on X-rays that leverages knowledge from EHRs.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional latent variable model, where we infer
the latent representation of the X-ray image with the variational posterior
conditioning on the associated EHR text. By doing so, the model acquires the
ability to extract the visual features relevant to the disease during learning
and can therefore perform more accurate classification for unseen patients at
inference based solely on their X-ray scans. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method on three public benchmark datasets with paired X-ray images and

Elastic Fracture Mechanics. Here we show that this is not the generic case due

new NLD data in the whole data range. The results obtained show that the
S-shaped heat capacity, a fingerprint of the pairing phase transition, is more
pronounced in even $^{94,96,98}$Mo nuclei than that in odd $^{93,95,97}$Mo
isotopes. This result is different with those obtained in two previous studies
by R. Chankova et al., [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 73}, 034311 (2006)] and K. Kaneko et
al., [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 74}, 024325 (2006)], in which the old NLD data and the
BSFG model with energy-independent level density parameter were used. Moreover,
the present work suggests that the very strong S-shape observed in the heat
capacities of both even and odd Molybdenum isotopes by K. Kaneko et al., [Phys.
Rev. C {\bf 74}, 024325 (2006)] should be re-investigated. The present work
also suggests that obtain the correct heat capacity and associated pairing
phase transition in excited nuclei, one should use the correct NLD data and the
best fitted BSFG NLD in the entire region where the experimental data are
available.

visual acuity (VA) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and to further
to compare PAL designs.
  Method: A simple two hidden layer CNN was trained to classify the gap
orientations of Landolt Cs by combining the feature extraction abilities of a
CNN with psychophysical staircase methods. The simulation was validated
regarding its predictability of clinical VA from induced spherical defocus
(between +/-1.5 D, step size: 0.5 D) from 39 subjectively measured eyes.
Afterwards, a simulation for a presbyopic eye corrected by either a generic
hard or a soft PAL design (addition power: 2.5 D) was performed including lower
and higher order aberrations.
  Result: The validation revealed consistent offset of +0.20 logMAR +/-0.035
logMAR from simulated VA. Bland-Altman analysis from offset-corrected results
showed limits of agreement (+/-1.96 SD) of -0.08 logMAR and +0.07 logMAR, which
is comparable to clinical repeatability of VA assessment. The application of
the simulation for PALs confirmed a bigger far zone for generic hard design but
did not reveal zone width differences for the intermediate or near zone.
Furthermore, a horizontal area of better VA at the mid of the PAL was found,
which confirms the importance for realistic performance simulations using
object-based aberration and physiological performance measures as VA.
  Conclusion: The proposed holistic simulation tool was shown to act as an
accurate model for subjective visual performance. Further, the simulations
application for PALs indicated its potential as an effective method to compare
visual performance of different optical designs. Moreover, the simulation
provides the basis to incorporate neural aspects of visual perception and thus
simulate the VA including neural processing in future.

that are capable of manipulating the properties of incoming light and imparting
lens-like wavefront to the output. Although they have shown promising
potentials for the future miniaturization of optics, the chromatic aberration
inherited from their diffractive nature plagues them towards many practical
applications. Current solutions for creating achromatic metalenses usually
require searching through a large number of meta-atoms to find designs that
fulfill not only phase but phase dispersion requirements, which leads to
intensive design efforts. Besides, most designs are based on regular-shaped
antennas driven by the designers' intuition and experience, hence only cover a
limited design space. Here, we present an inverse design approach that
efficiently produces meta-atoms with unintuitive geometries required for
broadband achromatic metalenses. We restricted the generated shapes to hold
four-fold reflectional symmetry so that the resulting metalenses are
polarization insensitive. In addition, meta-atoms generated by our method
inheritably have round edges and corners, which make them
nanofabrication-friendly. Our experimental characterization shows that our
metalenses exhibit superior performance over a broad bandwidth of 465 nm in the
near-infrared regime. Our method offers a fast and efficient way of designing
high-performance achromatic metalenses and sheds new insights for unintuitive
design of other metaphotonic devices.

including the classical $O(3)$ model, the 5-state ferromagnetic Potts model,
and a dimerized quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Particularly,
although the considered NN is only trained one time on a one-dimensional (1D)
lattice with 120 sites, yet it has successfully determined the related critical
points of the studied 3D systems. Moreover, real configurations of states are
not used in the testing stage. Instead, the employed configurations for the
prediction are constructed on a 1D lattice of 120 sites and are based on the
bulk quantities or the microscopic states of the considered models. As a
result, our calculations are ultimately efficient in computation and the
applications of the built NN is extremely broaden. Considering the fact that
the investigated systems vary dramatically from each other, it is amazing that
the combination of these two strategies in the training and the testing stages
lead to a highly universal supervised neural network for learning phases and
criticalities of 3D models. Based on the outcomes presented in this study, it
is favorably probable that much simpler but yet elegant machine learning

the section meets a given submanifold of the total space, it holds under
natural non-degeneracy conditions and can be simplified by using appropriate
connections. Moreover, we point out a class of submanifolds, that we call
sub-Gaussian, for which the formula is locally finite and depends continuously

any notion of singularity of sections that can be defined as the set of points
where the jet prolongation meets a given semialgebraic submanifold of the jet

introduced. Like the case of one dimension, the longer-range hopping can drive
topological transitions and leads to the larger topological invariant (vectored
Berry phase for the two dimensional SSH model). We obtain the phase boundaries
and topological phase diagrams from the winding pattern of $\rho(k_l)$ of the
Bloch Hamiltonian. Effects of correlations on the extended two dimensional SSH
model are also investigated. The correlation shifts the phase boundaries and
leads to topological transitions. Several special points in non-interacting
phase diagrams are chosen to illustrate the different phase transitions and a
correlations-driven topologically non-trivial phase from the trivial one is
found. In this work, the slave-rotor mean field method is applied to the
interacting model and we focus on the case of physical electrons, i.e. the Mott
transition of charge degree of freedom is avoided in our investigations.

the target density $\rho$ for all values of the L\'evy index $\alpha$; (ii)
""the gain $\eta_{max}/\eta$ achieved by varying $\alpha $ is bounded even in
the limit $\rho \to 0 $"" so that ""tuning $\alpha$ can only yield a marginal
gain""; (iii) depending on the values of the radius of detection $a$, the

across the electromagnetic spectrum. Multiwavelength observations are highly
important for understanding the nature of flares, because different
flare-related processes reveal themselves in different spectral ranges. To
study the correlation between thermal and nonthermal processes in stellar
flares, we have searched the databases of Kepler (optical observations) and
XMM-Newton (soft X-rays) for the flares observed simultaneously with both
instruments; nine distinctive flares (with energies exceeding $10^{33}$ erg) on
three stars (of K-M spectral classes) have been found. We have analyzed and
compared the flare parameters in the optical and X-ray spectral ranges; we have
also compared the obtained results with similar observations of solar flares.
Most of the studied stellar flares released more energy in the optical range
than in X-rays. In one flare, X-ray emission strongly dominated, which could be
caused either by soft spectrum of energetic electrons or by a near-limb
position of this flare. The X-ray flares were typically delayed with respect to
and shorter than their optical counterparts, which is partially consistent with
the Neupert effect. Using the scaling laws based on the magnetic reconnection
theory, we have estimated the characteristic magnetic field strengths in the
stellar active regions and the sizes of these active regions as about $25-70$ G
and $250\,000-500\,000$ km, respectively. The observed stellar superflares
appear to be scaled-up versions of solar flares, with a similar underlying
mechanism and nearly the same characteristic magnetic field values, but with
much larger active region sizes.

obligations. These obligations are fulfilled entirely or in part (when defaults
occur) via a mechanism called clearing, which determines a set of payments that
settle the claims by respecting rules such as limited liability, absolute
priority, and proportionality (pro-rated payments). In the presence of shocks
on the financial system, however, the clearing mechanism may lead to cascaded
defaults and eventually to financial disaster. In this paper, we first study
the clearing model under pro-rated payments of Eisenberg and Noe, and we derive
novel necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the clearing
payments, valid for an arbitrary topology of the financial network. Then, we
argue that the proportionality rule is one of the factors responsible for
cascaded defaults, and that the overall system loss can be reduced if this rule
is lifted. The proposed approach thus shifts the focus from the individual
interest to the overall system's interest to control and contain adverse
effects of cascaded failures, and we show that clearing payments in this
setting can be computed by solving suitable convex optimization problems.

i.e., covering from perception to control. Addressing the DNN model design,
from training and dataset augmentation to 8-bit quantization and deployment, we

However, recent developments in the field of insurance require four and more
objectives to be considered, among them the so-called solvency ratio that stems
from the Solvency II directive of the European Union issued in 2009. Moreover,
the distance to the current portfolio plays an important role. While literature
on portfolio optimization with three objectives is already scarce, applications
with four and more objectives have not yet been solved so far by
multi-objective approaches based on scalarizations. However, recent algorithmic
improvements in the field of exact multi-objective methods allow the
incorporation of many objectives and the generation of well-spread
representations within few iterations. We describe the implementation of such
an algorithm for a strategic asset allocation with four objective functions and
demonstrate its usefulness for the practitioner. Our approach is in operative
use in a German insurance company. Our partners report a significant

better quality than before within short running time.

fractional differential equation, the local existence of whose continuous
solutions under the weakest condition remained as an open problem until now.
The singularity of the equation arises from the discontinuity of the right-hand
side function $f(x,\omega)$ at $x=0$, and its order of singularity is the same
as the order of the fractional differential operator in the equation. The local
existence of solutions to singular equations of such type cannot be established
by a direct application of fixed point theorems only or other methods even
though they are enough for the same purpose in the case of equations including
a singularity of the order less than the order of the corresponding fractional
R-L operator. For this reason, we here propose a novel technique with a result
for continuous functions to establish a local existence theorem for the
problem. Moreover, a continuation result is suggested for the local solutions
to the problem and, thus, it will be revealed that in what circumstances their
existing interval can be extended to larger ones. Thanks to this and the
proposed technique, the global existence theorem for both sublinear and linear
equations is achieved.

training are not simple problems, but often a series of difficult combinations
(wrong compensation estimation, curse of dimension, overfitting, high
complexity, etc.). In this paper, we propose a framework to decouple network
structure from operator search space, and use two BOHBs to search
alternatively. Considering that activation function and initialization are also
important parts of neural network, the generalization ability of the model will
be affected. We introduce an activation function and an initialization method
domain, and add them into the operator search space to form a generalized
search space, so as to improve the generalization ability of the child model.
We then trained a GCN-based predictor using feedback from the child model. This
can not only improve the search efficiency, but also solve the problem of
dimension curse. Next, unlike other NAS studies, we used predictors to analyze
the stability of different network structures. Finally, we applied our
framework to neural structure search and achieved significant improvements on
multiple datasets.

derive a modified non-cryptography string hash function from the selected hash
function for deepBF by introducing biases in the hashing method and compared

unearth weakness and strength of the filters. Secondly, we propose a malicious

  University of Passau on September 25, 2020. 80 pages, 4 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The paper [Ras15a] introduced distribution-valued games. This game-theoretic
model uses probability distributions as payoffs for games in order to express
uncertainty about the payoffs. The player's preferences for different payoffs
are expressed by a stochastic order which we call the tail order.
  This thesis formalizes distribution-valued games with preferences expressed
by general stochastic orders, and specifically analyzes properties of the tail
order. It identifies sufficient conditions for tail-order preference to hold,
but also finds that some claims in [Ras15a] about the tail order are incorrect,
for which counter-examples are constructed. In particular, it is demonstrated
that a proof for the totality of the order on a certain set of distributions
contains an error; the thesis proceeds to show that the ordering is not total
on the slightly less restricted set of distributions with non-negative bounded
support. It is also shown that not all tail-ordered games have mixed-strategy
Nash equilibria, and in fact almost all tail-ordered games with
finitely-supported payoff distributions can only have a Nash equilibrium if
they have a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.
  The thesis subsequently extends an idea from [AM19] and proposes a new
solution concept for distribution-valued games. This concept is based on
constructing multi-objective real-valued games from distribution-valued games
by segmenting their payoff distributions.

infant mortality across species. Since 2016 (Berrut et al. 2016) a succession
of studies (Bois et al. 2019) have traced infant mortality from organisms of
high complexity (e.g. mammals) down to unicellular organisms. Infant mortality
may be considered as a filtering process through which organisms with
potentially lethal congenital defects are eliminated. Such defects may have
many causes but here we focus particularly on mishaps resulting from
non-optimal conditions in the production of proteins, enzymes and other crucial
macromolecules. The statistical signature of infant mortality consists in a
falling age-specific death rate. The question we address here is whether infant
mortality episodes take place in bacteria in the minutes precededing or
following cell division. It will be shown that while experiments carried out in
the 20th century tried but failed to detect such an effect (mostly because of
limited sample size), more recent observations provided consistent evidence of
a sizeable mortality, with a rate of the order of 0.7 per 1,000 per hour, in
the exponential growth phase of E. coli. A further crucial test will be to
measure the age-specific, post-division death rate. An experiment is outlined
for that purpose. It is based on the selection of stained cells through flow
cytometry and the derivation of their ages at death from their sizes. If an
infant mortality effect can be identified in E. coli it can be conjectured that
a similar effect also exists in other unicellular organisms, both prokaryote
and eukaryote.

attracted considerable attention, while how to mange and coordinate platoons in
urban networks remains largely an open question. This scientific gap mainly
results from the maneuver complexity on urban roads, making it difficult to
model the platoon formation process. Inspired by flocking behaviors in nature,
this paper proposed a two-dimensional model to describe CAV group dynamics. The
model is formulated based on potential fields in planar coordinates, which is
composed of the inter-vehicle potential field and the cross-section potential
field. The inter-vehicle potential field enables CAVs to attract each other
when vehicle gaps are larger than the equilibrium distance, and repel each
other otherwise. It also generates incentives for lane change maneuvers to join
a platoon or to comply with the traffic management layer. The cross-section
potential field is able to mimic lane keeping behavior and it also creates
resistance to avoid unnecessary lane changes at very low incentives. These
modeling principles can also be applied to human-driven vehicles in the mixed
traffic environment. Behavioral plausibility of the model in terms of
car-following rationality and car-following safety is demonstrated analytically
and further verified with simulation in typical driving scenarios. The model is
computationally efficient and can provide insights into platoon operations in
urban networks.

phase consisted of macroscopic quantum orbits similar to those responsible for
the integer quantum Hall effect. The dynamics is consistent with the standard
QM that predicts a ""cloud-like"" behavior of electron in quantum orbits
regardless of their lengthscale. Sinse the dynamics is beyond the relativistic
paradigm of movement, it may well be nonlocal. It thereby can be the basis for
a quantum concept of absolute simultaneity, which now rests not on the
meaningless notion of infinite speed but on empirically-tested quantum effect.
This concept revives the Bell-Popper idea to replace the current ""kinematic""
version of relativity by the ""dynamic"" version by Lorentz and Poincare with a
revival of the classical view of space and time where the problem of preferred
reference frame now can be solved without to involve the vague notion ""aether"".
We argue that the concept of quantum absolute simultaneity opens the door to a
realistic interpretation of standard QM through a deeper insight of what is
called ""reality"" and ultimately to a harmony between quantum and relativity
theories.
