  Communication with Statistical CSIT","33 pages, 6 figures, accepted by IEEE Trans. on Wireless Commun",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging technology to enhance
wireless communication in terms of energy cost and system performance by
equipping a considerable quantity of nearly passive reflecting elements. This
study focuses on a downlink RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
wireless communication system that comprises three communication links of
Rician channel, including base station (BS) to RIS, RIS to user, and BS to
user. The objective is to design an optimal transmit covariance matrix at BS
and diagonal phase-shifting matrix at RIS to maximize the achievable ergodic
rate by exploiting the statistical channel state information at BS. Therefore,
a large-system approximation of the achievable ergodic rate is derived using
the replica method in large dimension random matrix theory. This large-system
approximation enables the identification of asymptotic-optimal transmit
covariance and diagonal phase-shifting matrices using an alternating
optimization algorithm. Simulation results show that the large-system results
are consistent with the achievable ergodic rate calculated by Monte Carlo
averaging. The results verify that the proposed algorithm can significantly
enhance the RIS-assisted MIMO system performance.

when the detector interacts with the field through a delta coupling coherence

a coherent field depends on the phase of its amplitude distribution and its
initial energy as well as on the mean radius of the detector and the mean

2015cz show relatively large decline rates (0.88 and 1.64 mag/50d,
respectively) at early times before settling to the plateau phase, unlike the
canonical Type IIP/L SN light curves. All of them are normal luminosity SN II
with an absolute magnitude at mid-plateau of

continuum with broad H lines at early phases and narrower metal lines with P
Cygni profiles during the plateau. High-velocity H I features are identified in

orbits first, we derive a fundamental observation on the invariance of the
geometric multiplicity of the trivial Floquet multiplier. This observation
leads to a clear and unifying understanding of the odd-number limitation, both
in the autonomous and the non-autonomous setting. Since the presence of the
trivial Floquet multiplier governs the possibility of successful stabilization,
we refer to this multiplier as the determining center. The geometric invariance
of the determining center also leads to a necessary condition on the gain
matrix for the control to be successful. In particular, we exclude scalar
gains. Application of Pyragas control on equilibria does not only imply a
geometric invariance of the determining center, but surprisingly also on
centers which resonate with the time delay. Consequently, we formulate odd- and
any-number limitations both for real eigenvalues together with arbitrary time
delay as well as for complex conjugated eigenvalue pairs together with a
resonating time delay. The very general nature of our results allows for
various applications.

applications have demonstrated the possibility of developing rich, continuous,
and objective measures of multiple sclerosis (MS) disability that can be
administered remotely and out-of-clinic. In this work, deep convolutional
neural networks (DCNN) applied to smartphone inertial sensor data were shown to
better distinguish healthy from MS participant ambulation, compared to standard
Support Vector Machine (SVM) feature-based methodologies. To overcome the
typical limitations associated with remotely generated health data, such as low
subject numbers, sparsity, and heterogeneous data, a transfer learning (TL)
model from similar large open-source datasets was proposed. Our TL framework
utilised the ambulatory information learned on Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
tasks collected from similar smartphone-based sensor data. A lack of
transparency of ""black-box"" deep networks remains one of the largest stumbling
blocks to the wider acceptance of deep learning for clinical applications.
Ensuing work therefore aimed to visualise DCNN decisions attributed by
relevance heatmaps using Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Through the
LRP framework, the patterns captured from smartphone-based inertial sensor data
that were reflective of those who are healthy versus persons with MS (PwMS)
could begin to be established and understood. Interpretations suggested that
cadence-based measures, gait speed, and ambulation-related signal perturbations
were distinct characteristics that distinguished MS disability from healthy
participants. Robust and interpretable outcomes, generated from high-frequency
out-of-clinic assessments, could greatly augment the current in-clinic
assessment picture for PwMS, to inform better disease management techniques,
and enable the development of better therapeutic interventions.

surprises from a theoretical perspective. In particular, simple gradient
methods easily find near-optimal solutions to non-convex optimization problems,
and despite giving a near-perfect fit to training data without any explicit
effort to control model complexity, these methods exhibit excellent predictive
accuracy. We conjecture that specific principles underlie these phenomena: that
overparametrization allows gradient methods to find interpolating solutions,
that these methods implicitly impose regularization, and that
overparametrization leads to benign overfitting. We survey recent theoretical
progress that provides examples illustrating these principles in simpler
settings. We first review classical uniform convergence results and why they
fall short of explaining aspects of the behavior of deep learning methods. We
give examples of implicit regularization in simple settings, where gradient
methods lead to minimal norm functions that perfectly fit the training data.
Then we review prediction methods that exhibit benign overfitting, focusing on
regression problems with quadratic loss. For these methods, we can decompose
the prediction rule into a simple component that is useful for prediction and a
spiky component that is useful for overfitting but, in a favorable setting,
does not harm prediction accuracy. We focus specifically on the linear regime
for neural networks, where the network can be approximated by a linear model.
In this regime, we demonstrate the success of gradient flow, and we consider
benign overfitting with two-layer networks, giving an exact asymptotic analysis
that precisely demonstrates the impact of overparametrization. We conclude by
highlighting the key challenges that arise in extending these insights to
realistic deep learning settings.

the transmit power, and the user association vector of MIDs. An online

domains, and have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the
past several decades. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage,
and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of
large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale high-performance
computing (HPC) platforms. These executions must be managed using some software
infrastructure. Due to the popularity of workflows, workflow management systems
(WMSs) have been developed to provide abstractions for creating and executing
workflows conveniently, efficiently, and portably. While these efforts are all
worthwhile, there are now hundreds of independent WMSs, many of which are
moribund. As a result, the WMS landscape is segmented and presents significant
barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet
incompatible, systems that exist. As a result, many teams, small and large,
still elect to build their own custom workflow solution rather than adopt, or
build upon, existing WMSs. This current state of the WMS landscape negatively
impacts workflow users, developers, and researchers. The ""Workflows Community
Summit"" was held online on January 13, 2021. The overarching goal of the summit
was to develop a view of the state of the art and identify crucial research
challenges in the workflow community. Prior to the summit, a survey sent to
stakeholders in the workflow community (including both developers of WMSs and
users of workflows) helped to identify key challenges in this community that
were translated into 6 broad themes for the summit, each of them being the
object of a focused discussion led by a volunteer member of the community. This
report documents and organizes the wealth of information provided by the
participants before, during, and after the summit.

and with significant implications for the control of light-matter interaction.
In inhomogeneous and disordered media, however, multiple scattering prevents
the application of conventional approaches for the design of light fields with
desired properties. This is because any local change to such a medium typically
affects these fields in a non-local and complicated fashion. Here, we present a
theoretical methodology for tailoring an inhomogeneous one-dimensional (1D)
Hermitian dielectric index distribution, such that the intensity profile of an
incoming light field can be controlled purely locally, i.e., with little or no
influence on the field profile outside of a designated region of interest.
Strongly increasing or decreasing the light's intensity at arbitrary positions
inside the medium thereby becomes possible without, in fact, changing the
external reflectance or transmittance of the medium. These local modifications
of the medium can thus be made undetectable to unidirectional far field
measurements. We apply our approach to locally control the confinement of light
inside 1D materials with inhomogeneous continuous refractive index profiles and
extend it to multilayer films as well as to chains of coupled micro-resonators.

planning approach called the Flux Guided (FG) method, which generates
collision-free trajectories for multiple UAVs while maximising the coverage of
target(s). Our method enables UAVs to track directly toward a target whilst
maintaining maximum coverage. Furthermore, multiple scattered targets can be
tracked by scaling the formation during flight. FG is highly scalable since it
only requires communication between sub-set of UAVs on the open boundary of the
formation's surface. Experimental results further validate that FG generates
UAV trajectories $1.5 \times$ shorter than previous work and that trajectory
planning for 9 leader/follower UAVs to surround a target in two different
scenarios only requires 0.52 seconds and 0.88 seconds, respectively. The
resulting trajectories are suitable for robotic controls after time-optimal
parameterisation; we demonstrate this using a 3d dynamic particle system that

accompanied by bidirectional 4a0/3 spatial modulations of the superconducting

electronic states in the vortex halo in an applied magnetic field, in
strong-field that suppresses superconductivity, and in zero-field above Tc
reveals that the PDW is a primary state responsible for an emergent pseudogap

superconcentrated, meaning that their variances grow sublinearly in time. This
article introduces a new concept, called subroughness, meaning that there exist
two distinct points such that the expected squared difference between the
heights at these points grows sublinearly in time. The main result of the paper
is that superconcentration is equivalent to subroughness in a class of growing
random surfaces. The result is applied to establish superconcentration in a
variant of the restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) model and in a variant of the
ballistic deposition model, and give new proofs of superconcentration in
directed last-passage percolation and directed polymers.

number of potentially significant contributions that are overlooked previously.
In particular, we find that the shear strength, the symmetric and traceless
part of the flow gradient, will induce a quadrupole for spin polarization in
the phase space. We refer to this novel effect as the shear-induced

been used in the past to investigate the habitability of circumstellar planets
in binary systems and Earth-like analogs in systems with giant planets. Here,
we extend the concept to potentially habitable worlds on circumbinary orbits.
We show that habitable zone borders can be found analytically even when another

Kepler-16, Kepler-34, Kepler-35, Kepler-38, Kepler-64, Kepler-413, Kepler-453,

data consistency steps that fusions the network output with the data already
available from undersampled k-space in order to further improve reconstruction
quality. The performance of this framework for various undersampling patterns
has also been tested, and it has been observed that the framework is robust to
deal with various sampling patterns, even when mixed together while training,

Recent multi-wavelength data have revealed many examples of galaxies undergoing
stripping, often accompanied with multi-phase tails. As energy transfer in the
multi-phase medium is an outstanding question in astrophysics, galaxies in
stripping are great objects to study. Despite the recent burst of observational
evidence, the relationship between gas in different phases in the tails is
poorly known. Here we report a strong linear correlation between the X-ray
surface brightness and the H$\alpha$ surface brightness of the diffuse gas in
the stripped tails at $\sim$ 10 - 40 kpc scales, with a slope of $\sim$ 3.5.
This discovery provides evidence for the mixing of the stripped interstellar
medium with the hot intracluster medium as the origin of the multi-phase tails.
The established relation in stripped tails, also in comparison with the likely
related correlations in similar environments like galactic winds and X-ray cool
cores, provides an important test for models of energy transfer in the

study clumping and turbulence in the intracluster medium.

properties of the cellular cytoskeleton and on nuclear deformability. In
mammalian cells, the cytoskeleton is comprised of three interacting,
semi-flexible polymer networks: actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments
(IF). Recent experiments of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with and without
vimentin have shown that the IF vimentin plays a role in confined cell
motility. We, therefore, develop a minimal model of cells moving through
confined geometries that effectively includes all three types of cytoskeletal
filaments with a cell consisting of an actomyosin cortex and a deformable cell
nucleus and mechanical connections between the two cortices the outer
actomyosin one and the inner nuclear one. By decreasing the amount of vimentin,
we find that the cell speed is typically faster for vimentin-null cells as
compared to cells with vimentin. Vimentin-null cells also contain more deformed
nuclei in confinement. Finally, vimentin affects nucleus positioning within the
cell. By positing that as the nucleus position deviates further from the center
of mass of the cell, microtubules become more oriented in a particular
direction to enhance cell persistence or polarity, we show that vimentin-nulls
are more persistent than vimentin-full cells. The enhanced persistence
indicates that the vimentin-null cells are more subjugated by the confinement
since their internal polarization mechanism that depends on cross-talk of the
centrosome with the nucleus and other cytoskeletal connections is diminished.
In other words, the vimentin-null cells rely more heavily on external cues. Our
modeling results present a quantitative interpretation for recent experiments
and have implications for understanding the role of vimentin in the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

the potential to improve performance by asymptotically decreasing the
synchronization cost per iteration. However, this comes at a cost. Despite
being mathematically equivalent, the $s$-step variant is known to behave quite
differently in finite precision, with potential for greater loss of accuracy
and a decrease in the convergence rate relative to the classical algorithm. It
has previously been shown that the errors that occur in the $s$-step version
follow the same structure as the errors in the classical algorithm, but with
the addition of an amplification factor that depends on the square of the
condition number of the $O(s)-$dimensional Krylov bases computed in each outer
loop. As the condition number of these $s$-step bases grows (in some cases very
quickly) with $s$, this limits the parameter $s$ that can be chosen and thus
limits the performance that can be achieved. In this work we show that if a
select few computations in $s$-step Lanczos are performed in double the working
precision, the error terms then depend only linearly on the conditioning of the
$s$-step bases. This has the potential for drastically improving the numerical
behavior of the algorithm with little impact on per-iteration performance. Our

hydrogen/helium envelopes, consisting of a few to ten percent of their total
mass, from the primordial gas disk. Subsequently, hydrodynamic escape driven by
core-powered mass-loss and/or photo-evaporation likely stripped much of these
primordial envelopes from the lower-mass and closer-in planets to form the
super-Earth population. In this work we show that after undergoing core-powered
mass-loss, some super-Earths can retain small residual H/He envelopes. This
retention is possible because, for significantly depleted atmospheres, the
density at the radiative-convective boundary drops sufficiently such that thhe
cooling time-scale becomes less than the mass-loss time-scale. The residual
envelope is therefore able to contract, terminating further mass loss. Using
analytic calculations and numerical simulations, we show that the mass of
primordial H/He envelope retained as a fraction of the planet's total mass,
$f_{ret}$, increases with increasing planet mass, $M_{c}$, and decreases with
increasing equilibrium temperature, $T_{eq}$, scaling as $f_{ret} \propto
M_{c}^{3/2} T_{eq}^{-1/2} \exp{[M_{c}^{3/4} T_{eq}^{-1}]}$. $f_{ret}$ varies
from $< 10^{-8}$ to about $10^{-3}$ for typical super-Earth parameters. To
first order, the exact amount of left-over H/He depends on the initial envelope
mass, the planet mass, its equilibrium temperature, and the envelope's opacity.
These residual hydrogen envelopes reduce the atmosphere's mean molecular weight
compared to a purely secondary atmosphere, a signature observable by current
and future facilities. These remnant atmospheres may, however, in many cases be
vulnerable to long-term erosion by photo-evaporation. Any residual hydrogen
envelope likely plays an important role in the long-term physical evolution of
super-Earths, including their geology and geochemistry.

investigate tidal circularization in close binaries using a large sample of
well-characterised eclipsing systems. We searched TESS photometry from the
southern hemisphere for eclipsing binaries. We derive best-fit orbital and
stellar parameters by jointly modelling light curves and spectral energy
distributions. To determine the eccentricity distribution of eclipsing binaries
over a wide range of stellar temperatures ($3\,000-50\,000\,$K) and orbital
separations $a/R_1$ ($2-300$), we combine our newly obtained TESS sample with
eclipsing binaries observed from the ground and by the Kepler mission. We find
a clear dependency of stellar temperature and orbital separation in the
eccentricities of close binaries. We compare our observations with predictions
of the equilibrium and dynamical tides. We find that while cool binaries agree
with the predictions of the equilibrium tide, a large fraction of binaries with
temperatures between $6\,250\,$K and $10\,000\,$K and orbital separations

implications also in the context of hot Jupiters where tides have been invoked
to explain the observed difference in the spin-orbit alignment between hot and
cool host stars.

role in the cosmological evolution of accreting black holes and their host
galaxies, samples of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in galaxies at close
separations are still small. In order to increase the sample of AGN pairs, we
undertook an archival project to investigate the X-ray properties of a
SDSS-selected sample of 32 galaxy pairs with separations $\le$150 kpc
containing one optically-identified AGN, that were serendipitously observed by
XMM-Newton. We discovered only one X-ray counterpart among the optically
classified non-active galaxies, with a weak X-ray luminosity
($\simeq$5$\times$10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$). 59% (19 out of 32) of the AGN in our
galaxy pair sample exhibit an X-ray counterpart, covering a wide range in
absorption corrected X-ray luminosity (5$\times$10$^{41}$-2$\times$10$^{44}$
erg s$^{-1}$). More than 79% of these AGN are obscured (column density
$N_H>$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$), with more than half thereof ({\it i.e.}, about 47%
of the total AGN sample) being Compton-thick. AGN/no-AGN pairs are therefore
more frequently X-ray obscured (by a factor $\simeq$1.5) than isolated AGN.
When compared to a luminosity and redshift-matched sample of {\it bona fide}
dual AGN, AGN/no-AGN pairs exhibit one order-of-magnitude lower X-ray column
density in the same separation range ($>$10 kpc). A small sample (4 objects) of
AGN/no-AGN pairs with sub-pc separation are all heavily obscured, driving a
formal anti-correlation between the X-ray column density and the galaxy pair
separation in these systems. These findings suggest that the galactic
environment has a key influence on the triggering of nuclear activity in
merging galaxies.

We find sharp divides by age and gender: for instance, anti-immigration ads
from major parties are 17% more likely to be seen by a male user than a female.
Unlike pro-migration parties, we find that anti-immigration ones reach a
similar demographic to their own voters. However their audience change with
topic: an ad from anti-immigration parties is 24% more likely to be seen by a
male user when the ad speaks about migration, than if it does not. Furthermore,
the viewership of such campaigns tends to follow the volume of mainstream news
around immigration, supporting the theory that political advertisers try to
""ride the wave"" of current news. We conclude with policy implications for
political communication: since the Facebook Ads Library does not allow to
distinguish between advertisers intentions and algorithmic targeting, we argue
that more details should be shared by platforms regarding the targeting

classical-input quantum-output (CQ) channels. That result showed that a number
of well-known duality results for linear codes on the binary erasure channel
could be extended to general classical channels at the expense of using dual
problems which are intrinsically quantum mechanical. One special case of this
duality is a connection between coding for error correction (resp. wire-tap
secrecy) on the quantum pure-state channel (PSC) and coding for wire-tap
secrecy (resp. error correction) on the classical binary symmetric channel
(BSC). While this result has important implications for classical coding, the
machinery behind the general duality result is rather challenging for
researchers without a strong background in quantum information theory. In this
work, we leverage prior results for linear codes on PSCs to give an alternate
derivation of the aforementioned special case by computing closed-form
expressions for the performance metrics. The noted prior results include
optimality of the square-root measurement (SRM) for linear codes on the PSC and
the Fourier duality of linear codes. We also show that the SRM forms a
suboptimal measurement for channel coding on the BSC (when interpreted as a CQ

convenience.

contribution introduces a python package, SymPKF, able to compute PKF dynamics

interactions between stars and black holes (BHs) can be extremely frequent,
leading to various astrophysical transients. Close encounters between a star
and a stellar mass BH make it possible for the star to be tidally disrupted by
the BH. Due to the relative low mass of the BH and the small cross section of
the tidal disruption event (TDE) for cases with high penetration, disruptions
caused by close encounters are usually partial disruptions. The existence of
the remnant stellar core and its non-negligible mass compared to the stellar
mass BH alters the accretion process significantly. We study this problem with
SPH simulations using the code {\tt Phantom}, with the inclusion of radiation
pressure, which is important for small mass BHs. Additionally, we develop a
new, more general method of computing the fallback rate which does not rely on
any approximation. Our study shows that the powerlaw slope of the fallback rate
has a strong dependence on the mass of the BH in the stellar mass BH regime.
Furthermore, in this regime, self-gravity of the fallback stream and local
instabilities become more significant, and cause the disrupted material to
collapse into small clumps before returning to the BH. This results in an
abrupt increase of the fallback rate, which can significantly deviate from a
powerlaw. Our results will help in the identification of TDEs by stellar mass
BHs in dense clusters.

outer radii. We also use the integrated values within one effective radius to
study different scaling relations. Comparing our cEs with others from the
literature and from simulations we reveal the formation channel that these
galaxies might have followed. All our cEs are fast rotators, with relatively
high rotation values given their low ellipticites. In general, the properties
of our cEs are very similar to those seen in the cores of more massive
galaxies, and in particular, to massive compact galaxies. Five out of our six
cEs are the result of stripping a more massive (compact or extended) galaxy,
and only one cE is compatible with having been formed intrinsically as the
low-mass, compact object that we see today. These results further confirm that
cEs are a mixed-bag of galaxies that can be formed following different
formation channels, reporting for the first time an evolutionary link within
the realm of compact galaxies (at all stellar masses).

models are required to disentangle multiple formation channels. In models with
isolated binaries, important uncertainties remain regarding the stability of
mass transfer (MT) and common-envelope (CE) evolution. To study some of these
uncertainties, we have computed simulations using MESA of a $30M_\odot$, low
metallicity ($Z_\odot/10$) star with a BH companion. We developed a
prescription to compute MT rates including possible outflows from outer
Lagrangian points, and a method to self-consistently determine the
core-envelope boundary in the case of CE evolution. We find that binaries
survive a CE only if unstable MT happens after the formation of a deep
convective envelope, resulting in a narrow range (0.2 dex) in period for
envelope ejection. All cases where interaction is initiated with a radiative
envelope have large binding energies ($\sim 10^{50}$ erg), and merge during CE
even under the assumption that all the internal and recombination energy of the
envelope, as well as the energy from an inspiral, is used for ejection. This is
independent of core helium ignition for the donor, a condition under which
various rapid-population synthesis calculations assume a successful ejection is
possible. Moreover, we find that the critical mass ratio for instability is
such that for periods between $\sim 1-1000$ days merging binary BHs can be
formed via stable MT. A large fraction of these systems overflow their L$_2$
equipotential, in which case we find stable MT produces merging binary BHs even
under extreme assumptions of mass and angular momentum outflows. Our
conclusions are limited to the study of one donor star, but suggest that
population synthesis calculations overestimate the formation rate of merging
binary BHs produced by CE evolution, and that stable MT could dominate the rate
from isolated binaries.

ratio, we find that the MZR evolution from z~1.5 to z=0 depends on stellar
mass, evolving by $\Delta\rm log(\rm O/H)\sim0.25$ dex at
$M_*<10^{9.75}M_{\odot}$ down to $\Delta\rm log(\rm O/H)\sim0.05$ at
$M_*>10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$. In contrast, the O3N2-based MZR shows a constant
offset of $\Delta\rm log(\rm O/H)\sim0.30$ across all masses, consistent with
previous MOSDEF results based on independent metallicity indicators, and
suggesting that O3N2 provides a more robust metallicity calibration for our
z~1.5 sample. We investigated the secondary dependence of the MZR on SFR by
measuring correlated scatter about the mean $M_*$-specific SFR and
$M_*-\log(\rm O3N2)$ relations. We find an anti-correlation between $\log(\rm

lie along the z=0 metallicity sequence at fixed
$\mu=\log(M_*/M_{\odot})-0.6\times\log(\rm SFR / M_{\odot} yr^{-1})$ suggesting
that the z~1.5 stacks can be described by the z=0 fundamental metallicity
relation (FMR). However, using different calibrations can shift the calculated
metallicities off of the local FMR, indicating that appropriate calibrations
are essential for understanding metallicity evolution with redshift. Finally,
understanding how [NII]/H$\alpha$ scales with galaxy properties is crucial to
accurately describe the effects of blended [NII] and H$\alpha$ on redshift and

sensitivity to dark energy and neutrino mass parameters with weak lensing
surveys. We first use image synthesis to show visually that, compared to the
power spectrum and bispectrum, the scattering transform provides a better
statistical vocabulary to characterize the perceptual properties of lensing
mass maps. We then show that it is also better suited for parameter inference:
(i) it provides higher sensitivity in the noiseless regime, and (ii) at the
noise level of Rubin-like surveys, though the constraints are not significantly
tighter than those of the bispectrum, the scattering coefficients have a more
Gaussian sampling distribution, which is an important property for likelihood
parametrization and accurate cosmological inference. We argue that the
scattering coefficients are preferred statistics considering both constraining

outburst of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar RX J0529.8-6556 in the Large Magellanic

pulse profile observed by NICER during maximum luminosity is similar to that
observed by XMM-Newton in 2000, despite the fact that the X-ray luminosity was
different by two orders of magnitude. By contrast, a modest decrease in
luminosity in the 2020 observations generated a significant change in pulse
profile. Second, we find that the historical optical outbursts are not strictly
periodic, as would be expected if the outbursts were triggered by periastron
passage, as is generally assumed. The optical peaks are also not coincident
with the X-ray outbursts. We suggest that this behavior may result from a
misalignment of the Be star disk and the orbital plane, which might cause
changes in the timing of the passage of the neutron star through the disk as it
precesses. We conclude that the orbital period of the source remains unclear.

well-controlled tensor network techniques for many-body limits. One powerful
approach combines matrix product states with extended reservoirs. In this
method, continuous reservoirs are represented by explicit, discretized
counterparts and a chemical potential or temperature drop is maintained by
external relaxation. Currents are strongly influenced by relaxation when it is
very weak or strong, resulting in a simulation analog of Kramers' turnover for
solution-phase chemical reactions. At intermediate relaxation, the intrinsic
conductance, that given by the Landauer or Meir-Wingreen expressions, moderates
the current. We demonstrate that strong impurity scattering (i.e., a small
steady-state current) reveals anomalous transport regimes within this
methodology at weak-to-moderate and moderate-to-strong relaxation. The former
is due to virtual transitions and the latter to unphysical broadening of the
populated density of states. Thus, the turnover analog has $five$ standard
transport regimes, further constraining the parameters that lead to recovery of
the intrinsic conductance. In the worst case, the common strategy of choosing a
relaxation strength proportional to the reservoir level spacing can prevent
convergence to the continuum limit. This advocates a simulation strategy where
one utilizes the current versus relaxation turnover profiles to identify
simulation parameters that most efficiently reproduce the intrinsic physical
behavior.

ionising photons such as star-forming galaxies and quasars, determines the
thermal evolution and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and
is, therefore, a critical ingredient for models of cosmic structure formation.
Most of the previous estimates are based on the comparison between observed and
simulated Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We present the results of an independent
method to constrain the product of the UVB photoionisation rate and the
covering fraction of Lyman limit systems (LLSs) by searching for the
fluorescent Lyman-$\alpha$ emission produced by self-shielded clouds. Because
the expected surface brightness is well below current sensitivity limits for
direct imaging, we developed a new method based on three-dimensional stacking
of the IGM around Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) between 2.9<z<6.6
using deep MUSE observations. Combining our results with covering fractions of
LLSs obtained from mock cubes extracted from the EAGLE simulation, we obtain
new and independent constraints on the UVB at z>3 that are consistent with
previous measurements, with a preference for relatively low UVB intensities at
z=3, and which suggest a non-monotonic decrease of $\Gamma$HI with increasing
redshift between 3<z<5. This could suggest a possible tension between some UVB
models and current observations which however require deeper and wider
observations in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission and absorption to be confirmed.
Assuming instead a value of UVB from current models, our results constrain the
covering fraction of LLSs at 3<z<4.5 to be less than 25% within 150kpc from
LAEs.

the time rate of change of the binary semimajor axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$
over a continuous range of eccentricities spanning $e=0$ to $e=0.9$. We find
that binaries with initial eccentricities $e_0 \lesssim 0.1$ tend to $e=0$,
where the binary semimajor axis expands. All others are attracted to $e \approx
0.4$, where the binary semimajor axis decays. The $e \approx 0.4$ attractor is
caused by a rapid change in the disk response from a nearly origin-symmetric
state to a precessing asymmetric state. The state change causes the time rates
of change $\dot{a}$ and $\dot{e}$ to steeply change sign at the same critical
eccentricity resulting in an attracting solution where $\dot{a} = \dot{e} = 0$.
This does not, however, result in a stalled, eccentric binary. The
finite-transition time between disk states causes the binary eccentricity to
evolve beyond the attracting eccentricity in both directions resulting in
oscillating orbital parameters and a drift of the semimajor axis. For the
chosen disk parameters, binaries with $e_0 \gtrsim 0.1$ evolve toward and then
oscillate around $e \approx 0.4$ where they shrink in semimajor axis. Because
unequal mass binaries grow toward equal mass through preferential accretion,
our results are applicable to a wide range of initial binary mass ratios.
Hence, these findings merit further investigations of this disk transition;
understanding its dependence on disk parameters is vital for determining the
fate of binaries undergoing orbital evolution with a circumbinary disk.

These uncorrected aberrations in a star's point spread function (PSF) obscure
faint companions and limit the sensitivity of high-contrast imaging
instruments. Most current approaches to processing differential imaging
sequences like angular differential imaging (ADI) and spectral differential
imaging (SDI) produce a self-calibrating dataset that are combined in a linear
least squares solution to minimize the noise. Due to temporal and chromatic
evolution of a telescope's PSF, the best correlated reference images are
usually the most contaminated by the planet, leading to self-subtraction and
reducing the planet throughput. In this paper, we present an algorithm that
directly optimizes the non-linear equation for planet signal to noise ratio
(SNR). This new algorithm does not require us to reject adjacent reference
images and optimally balances noise reduction with self-subtraction. We then
show how this algorithm can be applied to multiple images simultaneously for a
further reduction in correlated noise, directly maximizing the SNR of the final
combined image. Finally, we demonstrate the technique on an illustrative
sequence of HR8799 using the new Julia-based Signal to Noise Analysis Pipeline
(SNAP). We show that SNR optimization can provide up to a $5\times$ improvement

technique will allow for the detection of lower mass, and closer in companions,

Disk-planet interaction with dust-trapping at the edges of planet-induced gaps
is one plausible explanation. However, the sharpness of some observed dust
rings indicate that sub-mm-sized dust grains have settled to a thin layer in
some systems. We test whether or not such dust around gas gaps opened by
planets can remain settled by performing three-dimensional, dust-plus-gas
simulations of protoplanetary disks with an embedded planet. We find planets
massive enough to open gas gaps stir small, sub-mm-sized dust grains to high
disk elevations at the gap edges, where the dust scale-height can reach ~70% of
the gas scale-height. We attribute this dust 'puff-up' to the planet-induced
meridional gas flows previously identified by Fung & Chiang and others. We thus
emphasize the importance of explicit 3D simulations to obtain the vertical
distribution of sub-mm-sized grains around gas gaps opened by massive planets.
We caution that the gas-gap-opening planet interpretation of well-defined dust
rings is only self-consistent with large grains exceeding mm in size.

This mechanism relies on quantum-fluctuating bosons consisting of electron

coherent non-equilibrium condensate, different from conventional
superconductors, yet showing superconducting-like response in some regimes even
with dissipation. Unlike the case of driven fermionic bands which results in
the familiar Floquet bands with hybridization gaps, for driven bosons the ""gap""
opens up in the momentum direction, resulting in a resonant region in momentum
space where the eigenvalues are complex. We give a simple physical argument why
this picture leads to a ""perfect conductor"" which exhibits superconducting-like
frequency-dependent conductivity but no Meissner response. While our model is
quite general, in the case of cuprates, quantum-fluctuating pair density wave
in the pseudogap region may serve as the origin of the quantum-fluctuating
electron pairs.

However, there are currently many shortcomings of DCNNs, which preclude them as

adding small amounts of noise to an image, including an object, can lead to
strong misclassification of that object. But for humans, the noise is often
invisible. If vulnerability to adversarial noise cannot be fixed, DCNNs cannot
be taken as serious models of human vision. Many studies have tried to add

infinity, thereby their relative importance is preserved. This is achieved
without utilizing extremely high values for the learnable parameters, thus the
representation can be fed into downstream optimization methods and trained
efficiently in an end-to-end fashion. We present experimental results on graph

Networks (DNNs) is a pressing need pushed by the high costs required to train
such networks and the importance that DNNs are gaining in our society.
Following its use for Multimedia (MM) IPR protection, digital watermarking has
recently been considered as a mean to protect the IPR of DNNs. While DNN
watermarking inherits some basic concepts and methods from MM watermarking,
there are significant differences between the two application areas, calling
for the adaptation of media watermarking techniques to the DNN scenario and the
development of completely new methods. In this paper, we overview the most
recent advances in DNN watermarking, by paying attention to cast it into the
bulk of watermarking theory developed during the last two decades, while at the
same time highlighting the new challenges and opportunities characterizing DNN
watermarking. Rather than trying to present a comprehensive description of all
the methods proposed so far, we introduce a new taxonomy of DNN watermarking
and present a few exemplary methods belonging to each class. We hope that this
paper will inspire new research in this exciting area and will help researchers
to focus on the most innovative and challenging problems in the field.

accurate instrument tracking and augmented reality overlays. Therefore, the
topic has been the subject of a number of recent papers in the CAI community.
Deep learning-based methods have shown state-of-the-art performance for
surgical instrument segmentation, but their results depend on labelled data.
However, labelled surgical data is of limited availability and is a bottleneck
in surgical translation of these methods. In this paper, we demonstrate the
limited generalizability of these methods on different datasets, including
human robot-assisted surgeries. We then propose a novel joint generation and
segmentation strategy to learn a segmentation model with better generalization
capability to domains that have no labelled data. The method leverages the
availability of labelled data in a different domain. The generator does the
domain translation from the labelled domain to the unlabelled domain and
simultaneously, the segmentation model learns using the generated data while
regularizing the generative model. We compared our method with state-of-the-art
methods and showed its generalizability on publicly available datasets and on
our own recorded video frames from robot-assisted prostatectomies. Our method
shows consistently high mean Dice scores on both labelled and unlabelled
domains when data is available only for one of the domains.

important for developing novel systems for quantum simulation and computing.
The ability to tune the dispersive shifts of a cavity QED system provides more
functionality for performing either quantum measurements or logical
manipulations. Here, we couple two transmon qubits to a lumped-element cavity
through a shared dc-SQUID. Our design balances the mutual capacitive and
inductive circuit components so that both qubits are highly decoupled from the
cavity, offering protection from decoherence processes. We show that by
parametrically driving the SQUID with an oscillating flux it is possible to
independently tune the interactions between either of the qubits and the cavity
dynamically. The strength and detuning of this cavity QED interaction can be
fully controlled through the choice of the parametric pump frequency and
amplitude. As a practical demonstration, we perform pulsed parametric
dispersive readout of both qubits while statically decoupled from the cavity.
The dispersive frequency shifts of the cavity mode follow the expected
magnitude and sign based on simple theory that is supported by a more thorough
theoretical investigation. This parametric approach creates a new tunable
cavity QED framework for developing quantum information systems with various
future applications, such as entanglement and error correction via multi-qubit
parity readout, state and entanglement stabilization, and parametric logical
gates.

representation for the QEF using a Karhunen-Loeve expansion of the quantum
process on a bounded time interval over the eigenbasis of its two-point
commutator kernel, with noncommuting position-momentum pairs as coefficients.
This representation holds regardless of a particular quantum state and employs
averaging over an auxiliary classical Gaussian random process whose covariance
operator is specified by the commutator kernel. This allows the QEF to be
related to the moment-generating functional of the quantum process and computed
for multipoint Gaussian states. For stationary Gaussian quantum processes, we
establish a frequency-domain formula for the QEF rate in terms of the Fourier
transform of the quantum covariance kernel in composition with trigonometric
functions. A differential equation is obtained for the QEF rate with respect to
the risk sensitivity parameter for its approximation and numerical computation.
The QEF is also applied to large deviations and worst-case mean square cost

Then supervised machine learning is applied to minimize the weighted squared

patterns of variability, most notably the log-normality of the luminosity
distribution and the linear root-mean square (rms)-flux relationship. These
results are often explained using the theory of propagating fluctuations in
which fluctuations in the viscosity create perturbations in the accretion rate
at all radii, propagate inwards and combine multiplicatively. While this idea
has been extensively studied analytically in a linear regime, there has been
relatively little numerical work investigating the non-linear behaviour. In
this paper, we present a suite of stochastically driven 1-d $\alpha$-disc
simulations, exploring the behaviour of these discs. We find that the eponymous
propagating fluctuations are present in all simulations across a wide range of
model parameters, in contradiction to previous work. Of the model parameters,
we find by far the most important to be the timescale on which the viscosity
fluctuations occur. Physically, this timescale will depend on the underlying
physical mechanism, thought to be the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We
find a close relationship between this fluctuation timescale and the break
frequency in the power spectral density (PSD) of the luminosity, a fact which
could allow observational probes of the behaviour of the MRI dynamo. We report
a fitting formula for the break frequency as a function of the fluctuation
timescale, the disc thickness and the mass of the central object.

temporal notions of fairness and online decision-making through a novel

online decision-making algorithm satisfies fairness at the time of decision if
the said notion of fairness is satisfied for any entity receiving a decision in

introduces new methodological challenges in online decision-making. We
illustrate the novel approaches necessary to address these challenges in the
context of stochastic convex optimization with bandit feedback under a
comparative fairness constraint that imposes lower bounds on the decisions
received by entities depending on the decisions received by everyone in the

fluctuation-dissipation theorem, a connection generically broken far from
equilibrium. In this work, we identify a class of perturbations whose response
around far-from-equilibrium steady states is linked to steady-state correlation
functions via an equilibrium-like fluctuation-response equality. We then
utilize this prediction to substantiate linearized hydrodynamic transport
equations that describe how spatial inhomogeneities in macroscopic
nonequilibrium systems relax. As a consequence, we derive nonequilibrium
Green-Kubo relations for the transport coefficients of two types of
hydrodynamic variables: local conserved densities and broken-symmetry modes. A
byproduct of this work is to provide a theoretical foundation for the validity

of rheological experiments on cell monolayer under serum starvation compared to
that of healthy cell monolayer with full serum. The normal functioning of cells
depends on the micronutrient supply provided by the serum in the growth media.
Serum starvation is one of the most widely used procedures in cell biology.
Serum deficiency may lead to genomic instability, variation in protein
expression, chronic diseases, and some specific types of cancers. However, the
effect of deprivation of serum concentration on the material properties of
cells is still unknown. Therefore, we performed the macro-rheology experiments
to investigate the effect of serum starvation on a fully confluent Madin Darby
Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell monolayer. The material properties such as storage
modulus (G') and loss modulus (G''), of the monolayer, were measured using
oscillatory shear experiments under serum-free (0% FBS) and full serum (10%
FBS) conditions. Additionally, the step strain experiments were performed to
gain more insights into the viscoelastic properties of the cell monolayer. Our
results indicate that without serum, the loss and storage moduli decrease and
do not recover fully even after small deformation. This is because of the lack
of nutrients, which may result in many permanent physiological changes.
Whereas, the healthy cell monolayer under full serum condition, remains strong
& flexible, and can fully recover even from a large deformation at higher
strain.

formulate a model for predicting future observations. When the primary
objective is prediction, some typical approaches in the planning phase are to
use well-established small-sample experimental designs in the design phase
(e.g., Definitive Screening Designs) and to construct predictive models using
widely used model selection algorithms such as LASSO. These design and analytic
strategies, however, do not guarantee high prediction performance, partly due
to the small sample sizes that prevent partitioning the data into training and
validation sets, a strategy that is commonly used in machine learning models to
improve out-of-sample prediction. In this work, we propose a novel framework
for building high-performance predictive models from experimental data that
capitalizes on the advantage of having both training and validation sets.
However, instead of partitioning the data into two mutually exclusive subsets,
we propose a weighting scheme based on the fractional random weight bootstrap
that emulates data partitioning by assigning anti-correlated training and
validation weights to each observation. The proposed methodology, called
Self-Validated Ensemble Modeling (SVEM), proceeds in the spirit of bagging so
that it iterates through bootstraps of anti-correlated weights and fitted
models, with the final SVEM model being the average of the bootstrapped models.
We investigate the performance of the SVEM algorithm with several
model-building approaches such as stepwise regression, Lasso, and the Dantzig
selector. Finally, through simulation and case studies, we show that SVEM
generally generates models with better prediction performance in comparison to
one-shot model selection approaches.

time model, including as a special case the Weibull proportional hazard model.
The stratification is determined a posteriori by taking into account that
strata might be characterized by different baseline survivals as well as
different effects of the predictors. This is achieved by considering a Bayesian
nonparametric mixture model and the posterior distribution it induces on the
space of data partitions. The optimal stratification is then identified by
means of the variation of information criterion and, in turn, stratum-specific
inference is carried out. The performance of the proposed method and its

correlation functions were determined to all orders in $n$, up to unknown
exponentially small corrections. In this paper we determine the first several
orders of the asymptotic expansion of the exponentially small correction
itself. To do this we use: the physical interpretation of the exponentially
small correction as the virtual propagation of a massive BPS particle, to fix
the leading term in the expansion; the supersymmetric recursion relations to
derive differential equations for the coupling-dependence of the subleading
terms; and the double-scaling limit, to fix undetermined coefficients in the

exponentially small term up to and including relative order $n^{-{5\over 2}}$.
We also use the recursion relations to calculate the subleading large-${\cal

variability. These models are post-processed using NASA Goddard's Planetary
Spectrum Generator (PSG) and PandExo to generate simulated observations with
JWST's NIRSpec PRISM mode at 365 different temporal outputs from each climate.
Assuming the need for 10 transits of TRAPPIST-1e to detect molecular features
at great confidence, we then use CHIMERA to retrieve on several randomly
selected weighted averages of our simulated observations to explore the effect
of multi-epoch observations with variable cloud cover along the limb on
retrieved abundances. We find that the variable spectra do not affect retrieved
abundances at detectable levels for our sample of TRAPPIST-1e models.

areas due to the evolution of smart contracts. However, developing smart
contracts is non-trivial and challenging due to the lack of tools and expertise
in this field. A promising solution to overcome this issue is to use
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), however, using models still involves a learning
curve and might not be suitable for non-technical users. To tackle this
challenge, chatbot or conversational interfaces can be used to assess the
non-technical users to specify a smart contract in gradual and interactive
manner.
  In this paper, we propose iContractBot, a chatbot for modeling and developing
smart contracts. Moreover, we investigate how to integrate iContractBot with
iContractML, a domain-specific modeling language for developing smart
contracts, and instantiate intention models from the chatbot. The iContractBot
framework provides a domain-specific language (DSL) based on the user intention
and performs model-to-text transformation to generate the smart contract code.
A smart contract use case is presented to demonstrate how iContractBot can be
utilized for creating models and generating the deployment artifacts for smart
contracts based on a simple conversation.

eliminate a discrepancy in the assumptions made in the recent reaction rate

samples ten different electromagnetic bands (radio - X-ray) over a 7-hour

the variability properties in our data, we implemented a combination of
cross-correlation and Fourier analyses. We find that the emission is highly
correlated between different bands, measuring time-lags ranging from hundreds
of milliseconds between the X-ray/optical bands to minutes between the

However, mission-critical applications impose stringent quality of service

We combine recently developed methods of perturbative algebraic quantum field
theory with techniques developed in the realm of constructive quantum field
theory over Euclidean spacetimes to construct the correlation functions of the
equilibrium state of the Sine-Gordon theory in the adiabatic limit. First of
all, the observables of the Sine-Gordon theory are seen as functionals over the
free configurations and are obtained as a suitable combination of the
S-matrices of the interaction Lagrangian restricted to compact spacetime
regions over the free massive theory. These S-matrices are given as power
series in the coupling constant with values in the algebra of fields over the
free massive theory. Adapting techniques like conditioning and inverse
conditioning to spacetimes with Lorentzian signature, we prove that these power
series converge when evaluated on a generic field configuration. The latter
observation implies convergence in the strong operator topology in the GNS
representations of the considered states. In the second part of the paper,
adapting the cluster expansion technique to the Lorentzian case, we prove that
the correlation functions of the interacting equilibrium state at finite

a discretization framework that respect the cohomological structure of the de

element methods. Multisymplectic variational integrators are a class of
geometric numerical integrators for Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field theories,
and they yield methods that preserve the multisymplectic structure and
momentum-conservation properties of the continuous system. In this paper, we
investigate the synthesis of these two approaches, by constructing
discretization of the variational principle for Lagrangian field theories
utilizing structure-preserving finite element projections. In our
investigation, compatible discretization by cochain projections plays a pivotal
role in the preservation of the variational structure at the discrete level,
allowing the discrete variational structure to essentially be the restriction
of the continuum variational structure to a finite-dimensional subspace. The
preservation of the variational structure at the discrete level will allow us
to construct a discrete Cartan form, which encodes the variational structure of
the discrete theory, and subsequently, we utilize the discrete Cartan form to
naturally state discrete analogues of Noether's theorem and multisymplecticity,
which generalize those introduced in the discrete Lagrangian variational
framework by Marsden et al. [29]. We will study both covariant spacetime
discretization and canonical spatial semi-discretization, and subsequently
relate the two in the case of spacetime tensor product finite element spaces.

gapped. At energies below this gap, the interaction between quasi-particles
will be dominated by local interactions generated by off-shell dilaton
exchange. The dilaton mass can, in turn, be related via anomaly matching, to
the scattering length and contact parameter within the confines of a systematic
expansion. We use this relation to predict the s-wave Landau parameter to be
$f=\frac{4\pi a (2\epsilon(p_F)-p_F^2/m_\star)^2 m}{3p_F^4 \tilde{C}(a)}$ where

quite right."" Although TD studies have gained momentum, TD has yet to be
studied as thoroughly in non-Object-Oriented (OO) or scientific software such
as R. R is a multi-paradigm programming language, whose popularity in data
science and statistical applications has amplified in recent years. Due to R's
inherent ability to expand through user-contributed packages, several
community-led organizations were created to organize and peer-review packages
in a concerted effort to increase their quality. Nonetheless, it is well-known
that most R users do not have a technical programming background, being from
multiple disciplines. Objective: The goal of this study is to investigate TD in
the peer-review documentation of R packages led by rOpenSci. Method: We
collected over 5000 comments from 157 packages that had been reviewed and
approved to be published at rOpenSci. We manually analyzed a sample dataset of
these comments posted by package authors, editors of rOpenSci, and reviewers
during the review process to investigate the TD types present in these reviews.
Results: The findings of our study include (i) a taxonomy of TD derived from
our analysis of the peer-reviews (ii) documentation debt as being the most
prevalent type of debt (iii) different user roles are concerned with different
types of TD. For instance, reviewers tend to report some TD types more than
other roles, and the TD types they report are different from those reported by
the authors of a package. Conclusion: TD analysis in scientific software or
peer-review is almost non-existent. Our study is a pioneer but within the
context of R packages. However, our findings can serve as a starting point for
replication studies, given our public datasets, to perform similar analyses in
other scientific software or to investigate the rationale behind our findings.

composite terms, one of which having finite-sum structure. For this setting we
propose a variance reduction algorithm with complexity estimates superior to
the existing bounds in the literature. Second, we consider finite-sum
saddle-point problems with composite terms and propose several algorithms
depending on the properties of the composite terms. When the composite terms
are smooth we obtain better complexity bounds than the ones in the literature,
including the bounds of a recently proposed nearly-optimal algorithms which do
not consider the composite structure of the problem. If the composite terms are
prox-friendly, we propose a variance reduction algorithm that, on the one hand,
is accelerated compared to existing variance reduction algorithms and, on the
other hand, provides in the composite setting similar complexity bounds to the
nearly-optimal algorithm which is designed for non-composite setting. Besides
that, our algorithms allow to separate the complexity bounds, i.e. estimate,
for each part of the objective separately, the number of oracle calls that is
sufficient to achieve a given accuracy. This is important since different parts
can have different arithmetic complexity of the oracle, and it is desired to
call expensive oracles less often than cheap oracles. The key thing to all
these results is our general framework for saddle-point problems, which may be
of independent interest. This framework, in turn is based on our proposed
Accelerated Meta-Algorithm for composite optimization with probabilistic
inexact oracles and probabilistic inexactness in the proximal mapping, which
may be of independent interest as well.

heterogeneous IoT settings (e.g., commercial aerial drones), where different
levels of trust/control is assumed on the trusted third party. Our schemes are

directional in-plane propagation, ultra-low losses, and broad spectral
tunability have opened the door for unprecedented manipulation of the flow of
light at the nanoscale. However, despite their extraordinary potential for
nano-optics, these unique polaritons also present an important limitation:
their directional propagation is intrinsically determined by the crystal
structure of the host material, which imposes forbidden directions of
propagation and hinders its control. Here, we theoretically predict and
experimentally demonstrate that directional polaritons (in-plane hyperbolic
phonon polaritons) in a vdW biaxial slab (alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide) can
be steered along previously forbidden directions by inducing an optical
topological transition, which naturally emerges when placing the slab on a
substrate with a given negative permittivity (4H-SiC). Importantly, due to the
low-loss nature of this topological transition, we are able to visualize in
real space exotic intermediate polaritonic states between mutually orthogonal
hyperbolic regimes, which permit to unveil the unique topological origin of the
transition. This work provides new insights into the emergence of low-loss
optical topological transitions in vdW crystals, offering a novel route to
efficiently steer the flow of energy at the nanoscale.

scarcity is a universal issue that occurs in a vast range of data analytics
problems, due to the high costs associated with collecting, generating, and

spectrally negative Markov risk model. Note that for both spectrally negative
Levy and diffusion processes, first passage theories which are based on
identifying two basic monotone harmonic functions/martingales have been
developped. This means that for these processes many control problems involving

bandwidth, and the packet loss play an important role in determining the
Quality of Experience (QoE) of mobile applications. Various factors like the
Radio Resource Control (RRC) states, the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) specific
retransmission configurations, handovers triggered by the user mobility, the
network load, etc. can cause high variability in these QoS metrics on 4G/LTE,
and WiFi networks, which can be detrimental to the application QoE. Therefore,
exposing the mobile application to realistic network QoS metrics is critical
for a tester attempting to predict its QoE. A viable approach is testing using
synthetic traces. The main challenge in the generation of realistic synthetic
traces is the diversity of environments and the lack of wide scope of real
traces to calibrate the generators. In this paper, we describe a
measurement-driven methodology based on transfer learning with Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) neural nets to solve this problem. The methodology requires a
relatively short sample of the targeted environment to adapt the presented
basic model to new environments, thus simplifying synthetic traces generation.
We present this feature for realistic WiFi and LTE cloud access time models
adapted for diverse target environments with a trace size of just 6000 samples
measured over a few tens of minutes. We demonstrate that synthetic traces
generated from these models are capable of accurately reproducing application
QoE metric distributions including their outlier values.

example using convolutional neural networks such as U-NETs that are trained on

commonly used DDWP models in order to improve their physical consistency and
forecast accuracy. These components are 1) a deep spatial transformer added to
the latent space of the U-NETs to preserve a property called equivariance,
which is related to correctly capturing rotations and scalings of features in
spatio-temporal data, 2) a data-assimilation (DA) algorithm to ingest noisy
observations and improve the initial conditions for next forecasts, and 3) a
multi-time-step algorithm, which combines forecasts from DDWP models with
different time steps through DA, improving the accuracy of forecasts at short
intervals. To show the benefit/feasibility of each component, we use
geopotential height at 500~hPa (Z500) from ERA5 reanalysis and examine the
short-term forecast accuracy of specific setups of the DDWP framework. Results
show that the equivariance-preserving networks (U-STNs) clearly outperform the
U-NETs, for example improving the forecast skill by $45\%$. Using a sigma-point
ensemble Kalman (SPEnKF) algorithm for DA and U-STN as the forward model, we
show that stable, accurate DA cycles are achieved even with high observation
noise. The DDWP+DA framework substantially benefits from large ($O(1000)$)
ensembles that are inexpensively generated with the data-driven forward model
in each DA cycle. The multi-time-step DDWP+DA framework also shows promises,
e.g., it reduces the average error by factors of 2-3.

considered as neutral colloids in aqueous media, although it is well known,
since the pioneering work of Pelton and coworkers [Langmuir 1989, 5, 816-818],
that the vanishing electrophoretic mobility characterizing swollen microgels
largely increases above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of
PNIPAm, at which microgels partially collapse. The presence of an electric
charge has been attributed to the ionic initiators that are employed when FRP
is performed in water and that stay anchored to microgel particles. Combining
dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoresis, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments, we show that
collapsed ionic PNIPAm microgels undergo large mobility reversal and reentrant
condensation when they are co-suspended with oppositely charged
polyelectrolytes (PE) or nanoparticles (NP), while their stability remains
unaffected by PE or NP addition at lower temperatures, where microgels are
swollen and their charge density is low. Our results highlight a somehow
double-faced electrostatic behavior of PNIPAm microgels due to their tunable
charge density: they behave as quasi-neutral colloids at temperature below
LCST, while they strongly interact with oppositely charged species when they
are in their collapsed state. The very similar phenomenology encountered when
microgels are surrounded by polylysine chains and silica nanoparticles points
to the general character of this twofold behavior of PNIPAm-based colloids in
water.

multiple robots which minimize the accumulated uncertainty of a static hidden
state over an a priori unknown horizon. The majority of existing AIA approaches
are centralized and, therefore, face scaling challenges. To mitigate this
issue, we propose an online algorithm that relies on decomposing the AIA task
into local tasks via a dynamic space-partitioning method. The local subtasks
are formulated online and require the robots to switch between exploration and
active information gathering roles depending on their functionality in the
environment. The switching process is tightly integrated with optimizing
information gathering giving rise to a hybrid control approach. We show that
the proposed decomposition-based algorithm is probabilistically complete for
homogeneous sensor teams and under linearity and Gaussian assumptions. We
provide extensive simulation results that show that the proposed algorithm can
address large-scale estimation tasks that are computationally challenging to
solve using existing centralized approaches.

extent by an Alfv\'en-wave (AW) energy flux. AWs energize the solar wind via
two mechanisms: heating and work. We use high-resolution direct numerical
simulations of reflection-driven AW turbulence (RDAWT) in a fast-solar-wind
stream emanating from a coronal hole to investigate both mechanisms. In
particular, we compute the fraction of the AW power at the coronal base
($P_{\rm AWb}$) that is transferred to solar-wind particles via heating between
the coronal base and heliocentric distance $r$, which we denote $\chi_{\rm
H}(r)$, and the fraction that is transferred via work, which we denote
$\chi_{\rm W}(r)$. We find that $\chi_{\rm W}(r_{\rm A})$ ranges from 0.15 to
0.3, where $r_{\rm A}$ is the Alfv\'en critical point. This value is small
compared to~one because the Alfv\'en speed $v_{\rm A} $ exceeds the outflow
velocity $U$ at $r<r_{\rm A}$, so the AWs race through the plasma without doing
much work. At $r>r_{\rm A}$, where $v_{\rm A} < U$, the AWs are in an
approximate sense ""stuck to the plasma"", which helps them do pressure work as
the plasma expands. However, much of the AW power has dissipated by the time
the AWs reach $r=r_{\rm A}$, so the total rate at which AWs do work on the
plasma at $r>r_{\rm A}$ is a modest fraction of $P_{\rm AWb}$. We find that
heating is more effective than work at $r<r_{\rm A}$, with $\chi_{\rm H}(r_{\rm
A})$ ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. The reason that $\chi_{\rm H} \geq 0.5$ in our
simulations is that an appreciable fraction of the local AW power dissipates
within each Alfv\'en-speed scale height in RDAWT, and there are a few
Alfv\'en-speed scale heights between the coronal base and $r_{\rm A}$.

conducted to study propagation and extinction of stoichiometric hydrogen/air
detonations in fine water sprays. Parameterized by water mass loading and
initial droplet size, a detonation extinction map is developed. Detonation
extinction would occur with larger mass loading and/or smaller droplet size.
General features of gas phase and water droplets and local detonation frontal
structures are well captured. Numerical soot foils are used to characterize the
influence of mass loading and droplet size on the detonation wave. The results
also show that the detonation cell size increases with increased mass loading
or decreased droplet size. Analysis on unsteady detonation extinction process
is performed with the evolutions of detonation frontal structure, spatial
distribution of thermochemical variables and interphase transfer rates (mass,
energy, and momentum). Moreover, the chemical explosive mode analysis reveals
that for stable detonation, thermal runaway dominates behind the Mach stem,
while chemical propensities of auto-ignition and thermal runaway appear
alternately behind the incident wave. When the induction zone length increases
as the reaction front (RF) and shock front (SF) are decoupled, localized burned
pockets surrounded by the autoignition chemical explosive mode can be observed.
In addition, the interactions between detonation wave and water droplets
demonstrate that the energy and momentum transfer have more direct interaction
with SF and RF than the mass transfer. The interphase transfer rates increase
with the water mass loading. Under the same mass loading, the smaller the
droplet size, the larger the interphase transfer rates. However, the size of
fine water droplets has a limited influence on the interphase momentum
exchange.

isolated galaxy images are generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation processed
with the observational realism code RealSim. The CNN's overall classification
accuracy is 88 percent, remaining stable over a wide range of intrinsic and
environmental parameters. We generate a mock galaxy survey from IllustrisTNG in
order to explore the expected purity of post-merger samples identified by the
CNN. Despite the CNN's good performance in training, the intrinsic rarity of
post-mergers leads to a sample that is only ~6 percent pure when the default
decision threshold is used. We investigate trade-offs in purity and
completeness with a variable decision threshold and find that we recover the
statistical distribution of merger-induced star formation rate enhancements.
Finally, the performance of the CNN is compared with both traditional automated
methods and human classifiers. The CNN is shown to outperform Gini-M20 and
asymmetry methods by an order of magnitude in post-merger sample purity on the
mock survey data. Although the CNN outperforms the human classifiers on sample
completeness, the purity of the post-merger sample identified by humans is
frequently higher, indicating that a hybrid approach to classifications may be
an effective solution to merger classifications in large surveys.

novel spatially varying transformations for image segmentation, we show
improved performance on various test cases. For instance, for a model trained

fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars in the optical and, for the first time,
mid-infrared. This work's calibration dataset provides the largest and most
comprehensive span of parameter space to date with homogeneous metallicities
from $-3<\textrm{[Fe/H]}<0.4$ and accurate Fourier parameters derived from 1980
ASAS-SN ($V$-band) and 1083 WISE (NEOWISE extension, $W1$ and $W2$ bands) RR
Lyrae stars with well-sampled light curves. We compare our optical
period-$\phi_{31}$-[Fe/H] with those available in the literature and
demonstrate that our relation minimizes systematic trends in the lower and
higher metallicity range. Moreover, a direct comparison shows that our optical
photometric metallicities are consistent with both those from high-resolution
spectroscopy and globular clusters, supporting the good performance of our
relation. We found an intrinsic scatter in the photometric metallicities (0.41
dex in the $V$-band and 0.50 dex in the infrared) by utilizing large
calibration datasets covering a broad metallicity range. This scatter becomes
smaller when optical and infrared bands are used together (0.37 dex). Overall,
the relations derived in this work have many potential applications, including
large-area photometric surveys with JWST in the infrared and LSST in the
optical.

channels in point-to-point, multiple access, and random access communication
scenarios. The proposed code employs $L$ decoding times $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_L$
for the point-to-point and multiple access channels and $KL + 1$ decoding times
for the random access channel with at most $K$ active transmitters. In the
point-to-point and multiple access channels, the decoder uses the observed
channel outputs to decide whether to decode at each of the allowed decoding
times $n_1, \dots, n_L$, at each time telling the encoder whether or not to
stop transmitting using a single bit of feedback. In the random access
scenario, the decoder estimates the number of active transmitters at time $n_0$
and then chooses among decoding times $n_{k, 1}, \dots, n_{k, L}$ if it
believes that there are $k$ active transmitters. In all cases, the choice of
allowed decoding times is part of the code design; given fixed value $L$,
allowed decoding times are chosen to minimize the expected decoding time for a
given codebook size and target average error probability. The number $L$ in
each scenario is assumed to be constant even when the blocklength is allowed to
grow; the resulting code therefore requires only sparse feedback. The central
results are asymptotic approximations of achievable rates as a function of the
error probability, the expected decoding time, and the number of decoding
times. A converse for variable-length stop-feedback codes with uniformly-spaced
decoding times is included for the point-to-point channel.

scenarios for the origin of the variability are an active galactic nucleus

reconstruction techniques have been used to accelerate traditional
magnitude-based MRI acquisitions; however, most do not recover the full phase

Complex Residual Network (DCRNet) is proposed to recover both the magnitude and
phase images from incoherently undersampled data, enabling high acceleration of
QSM acquisition. Magnitude, phase, and QSM results from DCRNet were compared
with two iterative and one deep learning methods on retrospectively
undersampled acquisitions from six healthy volunteers, one intracranial

undersampled healthy subject using a 7T scanner. Peak signal to noise ratio

substantially reduced artifacts and blurring compared to the other methods and
resulted in the highest PSNR and SSIM on the magnitude, phase, local field, and
susceptibility maps. It led to 4.0% to 8.8% accuracy improvements in deep grey
matter susceptibility than some existing methods, when the acquisition was
accelerated four times. The proposed DCRNet also dramatically shortened the
reconstruction time by nearly 10 thousand times for each scan, from around 80

dense networks contain subnetworks that once found can be trained to reach test
accuracy comparable to the trained dense network. However, finding these high
performing trainable subnetworks is expensive, requiring iterative process of
training and pruning weights. In this paper, we propose (and prove) a stronger
Multi-Prize Lottery Ticket Hypothesis:
  A sufficiently over-parameterized neural network with random weights contains
several subnetworks (winning tickets) that (a) have comparable accuracy to a
dense target network with learned weights (prize 1), (b) do not require any
further training to achieve prize 1 (prize 2), and (c) is robust to extreme
forms of quantization (i.e., binary weights and/or activation) (prize 3).
  This provides a new paradigm for learning compact yet highly accurate binary
neural networks simply by pruning and quantizing randomly weighted full
precision neural networks. We also propose an algorithm for finding multi-prize
tickets (MPTs) and test it by performing a series of experiments on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet datasets. Empirical results indicate that as models grow deeper
and wider, multi-prize tickets start to reach similar (and sometimes even
higher) test accuracy compared to their significantly larger and full-precision

consumption with the available resources, utility companies have introduced a
variety of rate structures over the years. This paper develops a comprehensive
optimization method that addresses the diversity of utility rate structure of a
commercial building. It includes a general set of constraints that can be used
for any system with a building load, a renewable source, and a battery energy
storage system (BESS). A cost function is formulated for each type of rate
structure that can be exercised by a utility on a commercial building. A novel
algorithm is developed to apply the optimization model and generate the desired
optimal outputs by using the appropriate cost function. The results for several
building loads and rate structure types were obtained and compared. A
sensitivity analysis was done on the optimization model based on the changes in
the rates using historical data. The results exhibit that adding BESS is more
effective for buildings with lower load factor and CPP rate structures in
comparison to the buildings with flat energy rates. Savings from adding
renewables such as solar is primarily influenced by energy charges whereas
additional benefits from BESS are dominated by demand charges. These results
can help a customer with deciding on the different rate structure options and
resource planning of their renewable generation and energy storage. Utilities
may also benefit from this work by designing a unified rate structure,
considering the increasing renewable penetration and BESS deployment in the
grid.

crucial aspects of image clustering. However, current deep clustering methods
suffer from the inaccurate estimation of either feature similarity or semantic
discrepancy. In this paper, we present a Semantic Pseudo-labeling-based Image
ClustEring (SPICE) framework, which divides the clustering network into a
feature model for measuring the instance-level similarity and a clustering head
for identifying the cluster-level discrepancy. We design two semantics-aware
pseudo-labeling algorithms, prototype pseudo-labeling, and reliable
pseudo-labeling, which enable accurate and reliable self-supervision over
clustering. Without using any ground-truth label, we optimize the clustering
network in three stages: 1) train the feature model through contrastive
learning to measure the instance similarity, 2) train the clustering head with
the prototype pseudo-labeling algorithm to identify cluster semantics, and 3)
jointly train the feature model and clustering head with the reliable

telescope, which is crucial for directly imaging Earth-like exoplanets. The
state of the art in high contrast post-processing and signal detection methods
were developed specifically for images taken with an internal coronagraph
system and focus on the removal of quasi-static speckles. These methods are
less useful for starshade images where such speckles are not present. This
paper is dedicated to investigating signal processing methods tailored to work
efficiently on starshade images. We describe a signal detection method, the
generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), for starshade missions and look into
three important problems. First, even with the light suppression provided by
the starshade, rocky exoplanets are still difficult to detect in reflected
light due to their absolute faintness. GLRT can successfully flag these dim
planets. Moreover, GLRT provides estimates of the planets' positions and
intensities and the theoretical false alarm rate of the detection. Second,
small starshade shape errors, such as a truncated petal tip, can cause
artifacts that are hard to distinguish from real planet signals; the detection
method can help distinguish planet signals from such artifacts. The third
direct imaging problem is that exozodiacal dust degrades detection performance.
We develop an iterative generalized likelihood ratio test to mitigate the
effect of dust on the image. In addition, we provide guidance on how to choose
the number of photon counting images to combine into one co-added image before
doing detection, which will help utilize the observation time efficiently. All
the methods are demonstrated on realistic simulated images.

phenomena have been observed for different boundary conditions and forcing.
Using discrete element method simulations, we show that segregation of a single
particle intruder can be described in a unified manner across different flow
configurations. A scaling relation for the net segregation force is obtained by
measuring forces on an intruder particle in controlled-velocity flows where
gravity and flow kinematics are varied independently. The scaling law consists
of two additive terms: a buoyancy-like gravity-induced pressure gradient term
and a shear rate gradient term, both of which depend on the particle size
ratio. The shear rate gradient term reflects a kinematics-driven mechanism
whereby larger (smaller) intruders are pushed toward higher (lower) shear rate
regions. The scaling is validated, without refitting, in wall-driven flows,
inclined wall-driven flows, vertical silo flows, and free surface flows down
inclines. Comparing the segregation force to the intruder weight results in
predictions of the segregation direction that match experimental and
computational results for various flow configurations.

The result we obtain generalizes well known trace theorems for

the boundary of a domain with sufficient regularity. The new generalized spaces
are associated with norms that are characterized by nonlocal interaction
kernels defined heterogeneously with a special localization feature on the
boundary. Intuitively speaking, the class contains functions that are as rough
as an $L^p$ function inside the domain of definition but as smooth as a
$W^{s,p}$ function near the boundary. Our result is that the $W^{1-s/p, p}$
norm of the trace on the boundary such functions is controlled by the nonlocal
norms that are weaker than the classical $W^{s, p}$ norm. These results are
improvement and refinement of the classical results since the boundary trace
can be attained without imposing regularity of the function in the interior of
the domain. They also extend earlier results in the case of $p=2$. In the
meantime, we prove Hardy-type inequalities for functions in the new generalized

the boundary as functions in the smaller space $W^{s,p}(\Omega)$. A
Poincar\'e-type inequality is also derived. An application of the new theory

test. However, unit test code is subject to issues, ranging from bugs in the
code to poor test case design (i.e., test smells). In this study, we compare
and contrast the occurrences of a type of single-statement-bug-fix known as
""simple stupid bugs"" (SStuBs) in test and non-test (i.e., production) files in
popular open-source Java Maven projects. Our results show that SStuBs occur
more frequently in non-test files than in test files, with most fix-related
code associated with assertion statements in test files. Further, most test
files exhibiting SStuBs also exhibit test smells. We envision our findings
enabling tool vendors to better support developers in improving the maintenance
of test suites.

applications that have bindings to data analysis libraries in Python. Double
precision data in OpenFOAM is cast to a NumPy array using the NumPy C-API and
Python modules may then be used for arbitrary data analysis and manipulation on
flow-field information. We highlight how the proposed wrapper may be used for
an in-situ online singular value decomposition (SVD) implemented in Python and
accessed from the OpenFOAM solver PimpleFOAM. Here, `in-situ' refers to a
programming paradigm that allows for a concurrent computation of the data
analysis on the same computational resources utilized for the partial
differential equation solver. In addition, to demonstrate data-parallel
analyses, we deploy a distributed SVD, which collects snapshot data across the
ranks of a distributed simulation to compute the global left singular vectors.
Crucially, both OpenFOAM and Python share the same message passing interface
(MPI) communicator for this deployment which allows Python objects and
functions to exchange NumPy arrays across ranks. Subsequently, we provide
scaling assessments of this distributed SVD on multiple nodes of Intel
Broadwell and KNL architectures for canonical test cases such as the large eddy
simulations of a backward facing step and a channel flow at friction Reynolds

for compressing the flow-field information using an autoencoder to demonstrate
an ability to use state-of-the-art machine learning tools in the Python

both the society and economy. A key factor contributing to the sustained
spreading is the presence of a large number of asymptomatic or hidden

quarantined. Here we propose an effective non-pharmacological intervention
method of detecting the asymptomatic spreaders in contact-tracing networks, and
validated it on the empirical COVID-19 spreading network in Singapore. We find
that using pure physical spreading equations, the hidden spreaders of COVID-19

characteristics of COVID-19 spreading dynamics, we propose a computational
framework capturing the transition probabilities among different infectious
states in a network, and extend it to an efficient algorithm to identify
asymptotic individuals. Our simulation results indicate that a screening method
using our prediction outperforms machine learning algorithms, e.g. graph neural
networks, that are designed as baselines in this work, as well as random
screening of infection's closest contacts widely used by China in its early

the 21 cm signal during the epoch of reionization (EoR). To investigate
differences induced on statistics of the 21 cm signal by various source types,
we use five radiative transfer simulations which have the same stellar UV
emission model and varying combinations of more energetic sources, such as
X-ray binaries (XRBs), accreting nuclear black holes (BHs) and hot interstellar
medium emission (ISM). We find that the efficient heating from the ISM
increases the average global 21~cm signal, while reducing its fluctuations and
thus power spectrum. A clear impact is also observed in the bispectrum in terms
of scale and timing of the transition between a positive and a negative value.
The impact of XRBs is similar to that of the ISM, although it is delayed in
time and reduced in intensity because of the less efficient heating. Due to the
paucity of nuclear BHs, the behaviour of the 21~cm statistics in their presence
is very similar to that of a case when only stars are considered, with the
exception of the latest stages of reionization, when the effect of BHs is
clearly visible. We find that differences between the source scenarios
investigated here are larger than the instrumental noise of SKA1-low at $z
\gtrsim 7-8$, suggesting that in the future it might be possible to constrain
the spectral energy distribution of the sources contributing to the

topological properties of magnetic materials. While AHE is usually proportional
to the magnetization, the nonlinearity suggests the existence of complex
magnetic and electron orders. Nonlinear AHE includes the topological Hall
effect (THE) that has been widely used to identify the presence of spin
chirality in real space. But it can in principle be induced by band structure
evolution via Berry curvatures in the reciprocal space. This effect has been
largely overlooked due to the intertwined mechanisms in both real and
reciprocal spaces. Here, we observed a giant nonlinear AHE with the resistivity
up to 383.5 uohm cm, contributing unprecedentedly 97% of the total Hall
response in EuCd2As2. Moreover, it can be further enhanced by tilting the
magnetic field 30{\deg} away from [001] direction, reaching a large anomalous
Hall angle up to 21%. Although it shows exactly the same double-peak feature as
THE, our scaling analysis and first-principles calculations reveal that the
Berry phase is extremely sensitive to the spin canting, and nonlinear AHE is a
consequence of band structure evolution under the external magnetic fields.
When the spins gradually tilt from the in-plane antiferromagnetic ground state
to out-of-plane direction, band crossing and band inversion occur, introducing
a bandgap at {\Gamma} point at a canting angle of 45{\deg}. That contributes to
the enhancement of Berry curvature and consequently a large intrinsic Hall
conductivity. Our results unequivocally reveal the sensitive dependence of band
structures on spin tilting process under external magnetic fields and its
pronounced influence on the transport properties, which also need to be taken
into consideration in other magnetic materials.

$Ax-|x|-b=0$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and $b\in \mathbb{R}^n$. In
this paper, we pay our attention on designing efficient algorithms. To this
end, we reformulate AVE to a generalized linear complementarity problem (GLCP),
which, among the equivalent forms, is the most economical one in the sense that
it does not increase the dimension of the variables. For solving the GLCP, we
propose an inexact Douglas-Rachford splitting method which can adopt a relative
error tolerance. As a consequence, in the inner iteration processes, we can
employ the LSQR method ([C.C. Paige and M.A. Saunders, ACM Trans. Mathe. Softw.
(TOMS), 8 (1982), pp. 43--71]) to find a qualified approximate solution for
each subproblem, which makes the cost per iteration very low. We prove the
convergence of the algorithm and establish its global linear rate of
convergence. Comparing results with the popular algorithms such as the exact
generalized Newton method [O.L. Mangasarian, Optim. Lett., 1 (2007), pp. 3--8],
the inexact semi-smooth Newton method [J.Y.B. Cruz, O.P. Ferreira and L.F.

method [Y.-F. Ke and C.-F. Ma, Appl. Math. Comput., 311 (2017), pp. 195--202]
are reported, which indicate that the proposed algorithm is very promising.
Moreover, our method also extends the range of numerically solvable of the AVE;
that is, it can deal with not only the case that $\|A^{-1}\|<1$, the commonly
used in those existing literature, but also the case where $\|A^{-1}\|=1$.

node (PAN) transmitting and receiving signals, and many secondary ANs (SAN)
only receiving signals. All the UDs can transmit and receive signals. The PAN
periodically transmits sync signal and the UD transmits response signal after
reception of the sync signal. Using TOA measurements from the periodic sync
signal at SANs, we develop a Kalman filtering method to virtually synchronize
ANs with high accuracy estimation of clock parameters. Employing the virtual
synchronization, and TOA measurements from the response signal and sync signal,
we then develop a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, namely ML-LAS, to
simultaneously localize and synchronize a moving UD. We analyze the UD
localization and synchronization error, and derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB). Different from existing asymmetric ranging network-based TOA systems,
the new PARN i) uses the periodic sync signals at the SAN to exploit the
temporal correlated clock information for high accuracy virtual
synchronization, and ii) compensates the UD movement and clock drift using
various TOA measurements to achieve consistent and simultaneous localization
and synchronization performance. Numerical results verify the theoretical
analysis that the new system has high accuracy in AN clock offset estimation
and simultaneous localization and synchronization for a moving UD. We implement
a prototype hardware system and demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of
the PARN in real-world applications by experiments.

  Learning and Primal-Dual Optimization Perspective",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To further understand the underlying mechanism of various reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms and also to better use the optimization theory to make
further progress in RL, many researchers begin to revisit the linear-quadratic
regulator (LQR) problem, whose setting is simple and yet captures the
characteristics of RL. Inspired by this, this work is concerned with the
model-free design of stochastic LQR controller for linear systems subject to
Gaussian noises, from the perspective of both RL and primal-dual optimization.
From the RL perspective, we first develop a new model-free off-policy policy
iteration (MF-OPPI) algorithm, in which the sampled data is repeatedly used for
updating the policy to alleviate the data-hungry problem to some extent. We
then provide a rigorous analysis for algorithm convergence by showing that the
involved iterations are equivalent to the iterations in the classical policy
iteration (PI) algorithm. From the perspective of optimization, we first
reformulate the stochastic LQR problem at hand as a constrained non-convex
optimization problem, which is shown to have strong duality. Then, to solve
this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a model-based primal-dual
(MB-PD) algorithm based on the properties of the resulting Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) conditions. We also give a model-free implementation for the MB-PD
algorithm by solving a transformed dual feasibility condition. More
importantly, we show that the dual and primal update steps in the MB-PD
algorithm can be interpreted as the policy evaluation and policy improvement
steps in the PI algorithm, respectively. Finally, we provide one simulation
example to show the performance of the proposed algorithms.

go to two parallel sub-networks for simultaneous density-based counting and

equation of state (EOS) with the generalized entropy theory (GET) of glass
formation. In our theory, thermodynamic scaling arises in the non-Arrhenius
relaxation regime as a scaling property of the fluid configurational entropy
density $s_c$, normalized by its value $s_c^*$ at the onset temperature $T_A$
of glass formation, $s_c / s_c^*$, so that a constant value of $TV^{\gamma}$
corresponds to a \textit{reduced isoentropic} fluid condition. Molecular
dynamics simulations on a coarse-grained polymer melt are utilized to confirm
that the predicted thermodynamic scaling of $\tau_{\alpha}$ by the GET holds
both above and below $T_A$ and to test whether the extent $L$ of stringlike
collective motion, normalized its value $L_A$ at $T_A$, also obeys
thermodynamic scaling, as required for consistency with thermodynamic scaling.
While the predicted thermodynamic scaling of both $\tau_{\alpha}$ and $L/ L_A$
is confirmed by simulation, we find that the isothermal compressibility
$\kappa_T$ and the long wavelength limit $S(0)$ of the static structure factor
do not exhibit thermodynamic scaling, an observation that would appear to
eliminate some proposed models of glass formation emphasizing fluid `structure'
over configurational entropy. It is found, however, that by defining a low
temperature hyperuniform reference state, we may define a compressibility
relative to this condition, $\delta \kappa_T$, a transformed dimensionless
variable that exhibits thermodynamic scaling and which can be directly related
to $s_c / s_c^*$. Further, the Murnaghan EOS allows us to interpret $\gamma$ as
a measure of intrinsic anharmonicity of intermolecular interactions that may be
directly determined from the pressure derivative of the material bulk modulus.

challenging in large scale distributed learning frameworks, such as Federated
Learning, especially in the presence of Byzantine workers. The celebrated

to avoid saddle-points in the standard centralized (non-distributed) setup. In
this paper, we extend the cubic-regularized Newton method to a distributed

saddle-point avoidance becomes more crucial in the presence of Byzantine
machines since rogue machines may create \emph{fake local minima} near the
saddle-points of the loss function, also known as the saddle-point attack.

first order counterparts. Furthermore we use compression (or sparsification)
techniques like $\delta$-approximate compression for communication efficiency.
We obtain theoretical guarantees for our proposed scheme under several settings

validate our theoretical findings with experiments using standard datasets and
several types of Byzantine attacks, and obtain an improvement of $25\%$ with

  BFT",,,,,"cs.CR cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  An urgent demand of deploying BFT consensus over the Internet is raised for
implementing blockchain services. The deterministic (partial) synchronous
protocols can be simple and fast in good network conditions, but are subject to
denial-of-service when synchrony assumption fails. Asynchronous protocols, on
the contrary, are robust against the adversarial network, but are substantially
more complicated and slower for the inherent use of randomness.
  Facing the issues, optimistic asynchronous atomic broadcast ( Kursawe-Shoup,
2002; Ramasamy-Cachin, 2005) was proposed to improve the normal-case
performance of the slow asynchronous consensus. They run a deterministic
fastlane if the network condition remains good, and can fall back to a fully
asynchronous protocol via a pace-synchronization mechanism if the fastlane
fails. Unfortunately, existing pace-synchronization directly uses a heavy tool
of asynchronous multi-valued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA).
  We present Bolt-Dumbo Transformer (BDT), a generic framework for practical
optimistic asynchronous atomic broadcast. At the core of BDT, we set forth a
new fastlane abstraction that is simple and fast, while preparing honest
parties to gracefully face potential fastlane failures caused by malicious
leader or bad network. This enables a highly efficient pace-synchronization to
handle fallback. The resulting design reduces a cumbersome MVBA to a variant of
the conceptually simplest binary agreement only. Besides detailed security
analyses, we also give concrete instantiations of our framework and implement
them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BDT can enjoy both the low latency

elastic stress and strain in living tissues, which may be dissipated by
internal rearrangement through cell topological transition and cytoskeletal
reorganization. Moreover, cells and tissues can change their sizes in response
to mechanical cues. The present work demonstrates the role of tissue
compressibility and internal rearranging activities on its size and mechanics
regulation in the context of differential growth induced by a field of
growth-promoting chemical factors. We develop a mathematical model based on
finite elasticity and growth theory and the reference map techniques to
describe the coupled tissue growth and mechanics in the Eulerian frame. We
incorporate the tissue rearrangement by introducing a rearranging rate to the
reference map evolution, leading to elastic-energy dissipation when tissue
growth and deformation are in radial symmetry. By linearizing the model, we
show that the stress follows the Maxwell-type viscoelastic relaxation. The
rearrangement rate, which we call tissue fluidity, sets the stress relaxation
time, and the ratio between the shear modulus and the fluidity sets the tissue
viscosity. By nonlinear simulation of growing tissue spheroids and discs with
graded growth rates along the radius, we find that the tissue compressibility
and fluidity influence their equilibrium size. By comparing the nonlinear
simulations with the linear analytical solutions, we show the size change as a
nonlinear effect due to the advection of the tissue density flow, which only
occurs when both tissue compressibility and fluidity are small. We apply the
model to study tumor spheroid growth and epithelial disc growth when a
reaction-diffusion process determines the growth-promoting factor field.

21-cm absorption detection (M1540-1453; $z_{abs}$= 2.1139). This is only the
fourth known absorption at $z>2$. The detection rate ($1.6^{+3.8}_{-1.4}$%)

with a sensitivity to detect CNM in damped Ly$\alpha$ systems (DLAs), has

To accomplish this requirement, the BS is implemented in hybrid architecture to

Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) as a first variant while

information science. However, noise in realistic quantum devices fundamentally
limits the utility of these quantum technologies. A conventional approach
towards large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum information processing is to use
multi-qubit quantum error correction (QEC), that is, to encode a logical
quantum bit (or a logical qubit) redundantly over many physical qubits such
that the redundancy can be used to detect errors. The required resource
overhead associated with the use of conventional multi-qubit QEC schemes,
however, is too high for these schemes to be realized at scale with currently
available quantum devices. Recently, bosonic (or continuous-variable) quantum
error correction has risen as a promising hardware-efficient alternative to
multi-qubit QEC schemes. In this thesis, I provide an overview of bosonic QEC
and present my contributions to the field. Specifically, I present the
benchmark and optimization results of various single-mode bosonic codes against
practically relevant excitation loss errors. I also demonstrate that
fault-tolerant bosonic QEC is possible by concatenating a single-mode bosonic
code with a multi-qubit error-correcting code. Moreover, I discuss the
fundamental aspects of bosonic QEC using the framework of quantum communication
theory. In particular, I present improved bounds on important
communication-theoretic quantities such as the quantum capacity of bosonic
Gaussian channels. Furthermore, I provide explicit bosonic error correction
schemes that nearly achieve the fundamental performance limit set by the
quantum capacity. I conclude the thesis with discussions on the importance of
non-Gaussian resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing.

self-righting from an upside-down orientation compared to small animals like
insects. Inspired by the winged discoid cockroach, we designed a new robot that
opens its wings to self-right by pushing against the ground. We used this robot
to systematically test how self-righting performance depends on wing opening
magnitude, speed, and asymmetry, and modeled how kinematic and energetic
requirements depend on wing shape and body/wing mass distribution. We
discovered that the robot self-rights dynamically using kinetic energy to
overcome potential energy barriers, that larger and faster symmetric wing
opening increases self-righting performance, and that opening wings
asymmetrically increases righting probability when wing opening is small. Our
results suggested that the discoid cockroach's winged self-righting is a
dynamic maneuver. While the thin, lightweight wings of the discoid cockroach
and our robot are energetically sub-optimal for self-righting compared to tall,
heavy ones, their ability to open wings saves them substantial energy compared
to if they had static shells. Analogous to biological exaptations, our study
provided a proof-of-concept for terrestrial robots to use existing morphology

simulations of the partial differential equation governing the evolution of the
current's shape (under the lubrication approximation) and to table-top

equation from lubrication theory allow us to compute a pre-factor, which is
\textit{a priori} arbitrary in the second-kind self-similar transformation, by
estimating the time required for the current to enter the self-similar regime.
With this pre-factor calculated, we show that theory, simulations and

current's memory resets, and another self-similar behavior emerges after an
adjustment time, which we estimate from simulations. Once again, with the

identified the critical ranges of strain and doping for the bilayer Cr2Ge2Te6
within which the ferromagnetic stability can be enhanced. Beyond the critical
range, the tensile strain can induce the phase transition from the
ferromagnetic to the antiferromagnetic, and the direction of magnetic easy axis
can be converted from out-of-plane to in-plane due to the increase of
compressive strain, or electrostatic doping. We also predicted an electron

The new linked mirror device consists of two straight magnetic mirrors
connected by two half-torus. The structure of the configuration as a whole is
three dimensional because the two linear mirror sections are not parallel. The
angle between the two mirror sections generates rotational transform which
results in good magnetic confinement of toroidally processing passing
particles. In this way the usual loss cone of the traditional linear mirror
machines is eliminated. The single particle confinement is similar to that of
tokamaks with most of particles well confined. The calculated neoclassical
confinement is very good and is even better than that of an equivalent tokamak.
Potentially the proposed linked mirror configuration can allow MHD stable high
beta equilibria with good plasma confinement suitable for neutron sources and
magnetic fusion reactors.

  Theory, Model, and Experimental Results",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bitcoin (BTC) is probably the most transparent payment network in the world,
thanks to the full history of transactions available to the public. Though,
Bitcoin is not a fully anonymous environment, rather a pseudonymous one,
accounting for a number of attempts to beat its pseudonimity using clustering
techniques. There is, however, a recurring assumption in all the cited
deanonymization techniques: that each transaction output has an address
attached to it. That assumption is false. An evidence is that, as of block
height 591,872, there are several millions transactions with at least one
output for which the Bitcoin Core client cannot infer an address. In this
paper, we present a novel approach based on sound graph theory for identifying
transaction inputs and outputs. Our solution implements two simple yet
innovative features: it does not rely on BTC addresses and explores all the
transactions stored in the blockchain. All the other existing solutions fail
with respect to one or both of the cited features. In detail, we first
introduce the concept of Unknown Transaction and provide a new framework to
parse the Bitcoin blockchain by taking them into account. Then, we introduce a
theoretical model to detect, study, and classify -- for the first time in the
literature -- unknown transaction patterns in the user network. Further, in an
extensive experimental campaign, we apply our model to the Bitcoin network to
uncover hidden transaction patterns within the Bitcoin user network. Results
are striking: we discovered more than 30,000 unknown transaction DAGs, with a
few of them exhibiting a complex yet ordered topology and potentially connected
to automated payment services. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed
framework is the only one that enables a complete study of the unknown
transaction patterns, hence enabling further research in the fields -- for
which we provide some directions.

interactions transform the electron motion from independent particles to the
collective motion of a viscous `electron fluid'. The fluid viscosity is an
intrinsic property of the electron system, determined solely by the
electron-electron interactions. Resolving the universal intrinsic viscosity is

orientation can be significantly tilted away from the transverse direction
towards the optical axis due to the coupling between longitudinal SAM and

in-shop clothes image. It is challenging because the person and the in-shop

in-painting or cycle consistency. Both of these two formulations encourage the

However, existing methods do not differentiate clothing and non-clothing

of the heavily coupled image contents. In this paper, we propose a Disentangled
Cycle-consistency Try-On Network (DCTON). The DCTON is able to produce
highly-realistic try-on images by disentangling important components of virtual
try-on including clothes warping, skin synthesis, and image composition. To
this end, DCTON can be naturally trained in a self-supervised manner following
cycle consistency learning. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks

adjustment of the desired muscle operation. We derived a mathematical model
that predicts the relationship between the input pneumatic pressure and the

method can divide social participants into different groups based on their
geographic location, social relationships, and/or related events. However, in
some applications, it is necessary to make more specific restrictions on the
members and the interaction between members of the group. Generally, graph
pattern matching (GPM) is used to solve this problem. However, the existing GPM
methods rarely consider the rich contextual information of nodes and edges to
measure the credibility between members. In this paper, a social group query
problem that needs to consider the trust between members of the group is
proposed. To solve this problem, we propose a Strong Simulation GPM algorithm
(NTSS) based on the exploration of pattern Node Topological ordered sequence.
Aiming at the inefficiency of the NTSS algorithm when matching pattern graph
with multiple nodes with zero in-degree and the problem of repeated calculation
of matching edges shared by multiple matching subgraphs, two optimization
strategies are proposed. Finally, we conduct verification experiments on the
effectiveness and efficiency of the NTSS algorithm and the algorithms with the
optimization strategies on four social network datasets in real applications.
Experimental results show that the NTSS algorithm is significantly better than
the existing multi-constrained GPM algorithm, and the NTSS_Inv_EdgC algorithm,

especially they are the main source of synthetic $^{13}\rm C$, $^{15}\rm N$,
$^{17}\rm O$ and some radioactive isotopes like $^{22}\rm Na$ and $^{26}\rm
Al$. The enrichment of He in nova ejecta indicates that the accreted material
may mix with the He-shell (He-mixing). The purpose of this work is to
investigate how the He-mixing affects the nova outbursts in a systematic way.
We evolved a series of accreting WD models, and found that the mass fraction of
H and He in nova ejecta can be influenced by different He-mixing fractions
significantly. We also found that both the nova cycle duration and ejected mass
increase with the He-mixing fractions. Meanwhile, the nuclear energy production
from $p$-$p$ chains decreases with the He-mixing fraction during the nova
outbursts, whereas the CNO-cycle increases. The present work can reproduce the
chemical abundances in the ejecta of some novae, such as GQ Mus, ASASSN-18fv,
HR Del, T Aur and V443 Sct. This implies that the He-mixing process cannot be
neglected when studying nova outbursts. This study also develops a He-mixing
meter (i.e. $\rm He/H$) that can be used to estimate the He-mixing fraction in
classical nova systems.

the evolution of Earth's climate and, therefore, may also be an important
mechanism in the evolution of the climates of Earth-like exoplanets. Aims: We
investigate the effects of radiogenic mantle heating, core size, and planetary
mass on the evolution of the atmospheric partial $CO_2$ pressure, and the
ability of a long-term carbon cycle driven by plate tectonics to control the
atmospheric $CO_2$ pressure. Methods: We developed a box-model which connects
carbon cycling to parametrized mantle convection. The carbon cycle was coupled
to the thermal evolution via the plate speed, which depends on the global
Rayleigh number. Results: We find decreasing atmospheric $CO_2$ pressure with
time, up to an order of magnitude over 10 Gyr. Higher abundances of radioactive
isotopes result in higher $CO_2$ pressures. We find a decreasing Rayleigh
number and plate speed toward planets with larger core mass fractions $f_c$,
which leads to lower atmospheric $CO_2$ pressure. More massive planets may
favor the development of more $CO_2$ rich atmospheres due to hotter interiors.
Conclusions: The dependence of plate tectonics on mantle cooling has a
significant effect on the long-term evolution of the atmospheric $CO_2$
pressure. Carbon cycling mediated by plate tectonics is efficient in regulating
planetary climates for a wide range of mantle radioactive isotope abundances,
planet masses and core sizes. More efficient carbon cycling on planets with a
high mantle abundance of thorium or uranium highlights the importance of
mapping the abundances of these elements in host stars of potentially habitable
exoplanets. Inefficient carbon recycling on planets with a large core mass
fraction ($f_c\gtrsim 0.8$) emphasizes the importance of precise mass-radius
measurements of Earth-sized exoplanets.

further explore connections between relations of the group $G_\emptyset$ and
the units in the tower $K_\emptyset/K$, especially their Galois module

velocity converges toward a non-zero value, so that even very long droplets
swim. Stretched circular capillaries are then used to explore even higher

essentially boil down to a flux-consistency constraint; this latter is, up to
our knowledge, novel and compares the discrete flux at a face to the mean value
over the adjacent cell of the continuous flux function applied to the discrete
unknown function. We then apply this result to prove the consistency of a
finite volume discretisation of a convection operator featuring a (convected)

Twelve molecules were detected: H2CO, CS, SO, NO, HNO, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CN, CCH,

Radiative transfer analyses of HCN, SO, CS, and CO were performed to constrain

indicated that the probability that data are random is $\sim 10^{-99}$. Thus we
proceeded and have used the counts-number data to compute 2D spatial
autocorrelation, power spectrum, and structure function.
  The most important result of the present study is a clear indication for
large scale spatial underlying correlations. This is evident in {\bf all} the
functions mentioned above. The 2D power spectrum has a logarithmic slope of -3
on large spatial scales and a logarithmic slope of -4 on small spatial scales.
The structure function has logarithmic slopes equaling 1 and 2 for the large
and small scales respectively. The logarithmic slopes of the structure function
and the power spectrum are consistent.
  A plausible interpretation of these results is the existence of a large scale
{\it compressible turbulence} with a 3D logarithmic slope of -4 extending over
the entire extent of the LMC. This may reflect the fact that the $\gamma$ Ray
emission is in star forming regions, where jets and shocks are abundant.
  Both the power spectrum and structure function exhibit steeper logarithmic
slopes for smaller spatial scales. This is interpreted as an indication that
the turbulent region has an effective depth of about 1.5 kpc.

eruption involving a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a Type-II radio burst,
performed by combining data from various space-and ground-based instruments. An
increasing standoff distance with height shows the presence of a strong shock,
which further manifests itself in the continuation of the metric Type-II burst
into the decameter-hectometric (DH) domain. A plot of speed versus position
angle (PA) shows different points on the CME leading edge travelled with
different speeds. From the starting frequency of the Type-II burst and
white-light data, we find that the shock signature producing the Type-II burst
might be coming from the flanks of the CME. Measuring the speeds of the CME
flanks, we find the southern flank to be at a higher speed than the northern
flank; further the radio contours from Type-II imaging data showed that the
burst source was coming from the southern flank of the CME. From the standoff
distance at the CME nose, we find that the local Alfven speed is close to the
white-light shock speed, thus causing the Mach number to be small there. Also,
the presence of a streamer near the southern flank appears to have provided
additional favorable conditions for the generation of shock-associated radio
emission. These results provide conclusive evidence that the Type-II emission
could originate from the flanks of the CME, which in our study is from the the
southern flank of the CME.

developers agreed that these 80 smells should never exist in any code base. We
then checked the frequency and change-proneness of these worst smells on 27
large Apache open-source projects. Our results show insignificant differences,
in both frequency and change proneness, between worst and non-worst smells.
That is to say, these smells are just as damaging as other smells, but there is
never any justifiable reason to introduce them. Finally, in follow-up phone

project stakeholders can, through quality gates or reviews, ensure that such

derive an effective Hamiltonian of a strong spin-orbit interaction material
Ca5Ir3O12. This system consists of three edge-shared IrO6 octahedral chains
arranged along the c axis, and the three Ir atoms in the ab plane compose a
triangular lattice. For such a complicated structure, we need to set up the
Wannier spinor function under the local coordinate system. We found that a
density-functional band structure near the Fermi level is formed by local dxy
and dyz orbitals. Then, we constructed the ab initio dxy/dyz model. The
estimated nearest neighbor transfer t is close to 0.2 eV, and the cRPA onsite U
and neighboring V electronic interactions are found to be 2.4-2.5 eV and 1 eV,
respectively. The resulting characteristic correlation strength defined by
(U-V)/t is above 7, and thus this material is classified as a strongly
correlated electron system. The onsite transfer integral involved in the
spin-orbit interaction is 0.2 eV, which is comparable to the onsite exchange
integrals near 0.2 eV, indicating that the spin-orbit-interaction physics would
compete with the Hund physics. Based on these calculated results, we discuss
possible rich ground-state low-energy electronic structures of spin, charge and
orbitals with competing Hund, spin-orbit and strong correlation physics.

VOF (volume of fluid) and the level set methods, which have been developed as
two different approaches widely used in various applications. The key to
success is to maintain a high-quality THINC reconstruction function using the
level set field to accurately retrieve geometrical information and the VOF
field to fulfill numerical conservativeness. The interface is well defined as a
surface in form of a high-order polynomial, so-called the polynomial surface of
interface
  (PSI). The THINC reconstruction function is then used to update the VOF field
via a finite volume method, and the level set field via a semi-Lagrangian
method. Seeing the VOF field and the level set field as two different aspects
of the THINC reconstruction function, the THINC-scaling scheme preserves at the
same time the advantages of both VOF and level set methods, i.e. the
mass/volume conservation of the VOF method and the geometrical faithfulness of
the level set method, through a straightforward solution procedure. The
THINC-scaling scheme allows to represent an interface with high-order
polynomials and has algorithmic simplicity which largely eases its
implementation in unstructured grids. Two and three dimensional algorithms in
both structured and unstructured grids have been developed and verified. The
numerical results reveal that the THINC-scaling scheme, as an interface
capturing method, is able to provide high-fidelity solution comparable to other
most advanced methods, and more profoundly it can resolve sub-grid filament
structures if the interface is represented by a polynomial higher than second
order.

alleviate the locking anomaly in non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS)-based
isogeometric analysis (IGA) using a two-field Hellinger-Reissner variational
principle. The proposed hybrid elements are derived by adopting the independent
interpolation schemes for displacement and stress field. The key highlight of
the present study is the choice and evaluation of higher-order terms for the
stress interpolation function to provide a locking-free solution. Furthermore,
the present study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed elements with the
treatment of several two-dimensional linear-elastic benchmark problems
alongside the conventional single-field IGA, Lagrangian-based finite element
analysis (FEA), and hybrid FEA formulation. It is shown that the proposed class
of hybrid elements performs effectively for analyzing the nearly incompressible
problem domains that are severely affected by volumetric locking along with the
thin plate and shell problems where the shear and membrane locking is dominant.
A better coarse mesh accuracy of the proposed method in comparison with the
conventional formulation is demonstrated through various numerical examples.
Moreover, the formulation is not restricted to the locking-dominated problem
domains but can also be implemented to solve the problems of general form
without any special treatment. Thus, the proposed method is robust, most
efficient, and highly effective against different types of locking.

unanswered. In many platform trials, the definition of error rates is not
straightforward as classical error rate concepts are not applicable. For an
open-entry, exploratory platform trial design comparing combination therapies
to the respective monotherapies and standard-of-care, we define a set of error
rates and operating characteristics and then use these to compare a set of

simulations, we aimed for realistic trial trajectories, such that e.g. a priori
we do not know the exact number of treatments that will be included over time

results indicate that the method of data sharing, exact specification of

strongly contribute to the operating characteristics of the platform trial.
Furthermore, different operating characteristics might be of importance to
different stakeholders. Together with the potential flexibility and complexity
of a platform trial, which also impact the achieved operating characteristics

Especially for metal lattices, the variations in the printed geometry cannot be
neglected. Therefore, the evaluation of the influence of microstructural
variability on their mechanical behavior is crucial for the quality assessment
of the produced structures. Commonly, the as-manufactured geometry can be
obtained by computed tomography (CT). However, to incorporate all
process-induced defects into the numerical analysis is often computationally
demanding. Thus, commonly this task is limited to a predefined set of
considered variations, such as strut size or strut diameter. In this work, a
CT-based binary random field is proposed to generate statistically equivalent
geometries of periodic metal lattices. The proposed random field model in
combination with the Finite Cell Method (FCM), an immersed boundary method,
allows to efficiently evaluate the influence of the underlying microstructure
on the variability of the mechanical behavior of AM products. Numerical
analysis of two lattices manufactured at different scales shows an excellent
agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, it provides a unique insight

conducts channel-wise supervision on the decoder of the estimation model to
help generate the density maps. To obtain the accurate supervision information
of different channels, the MDSNet employs an auxiliary network called
SupervisionNet (SN) to generate abundant supervision maps based on existing
groundtruth. Besides the traditional density map supervision, we also use the
SN to convert the dot annotations into continuous supervision information and
conduct dot supervision in the MDSNet. Extensive experiments on several
mainstream benchmarks show that the proposed MDSNet achieves competitive
results and the MDS significantly improves the performance without changing the
network structure.

but their successful delivery to target tissues following systemic
administration remains a challenge. In the present work, ultrasound-induced
inertial cavitation was evaluated as a mechanism to promote their extravasation
in a flow-through tissue-mimicking agarose phantom. Two different ultrasound
frequencies, 0.5 or 1.6 MHz, with pressures in the range 0.5-4 MPa were used to
drive cavitation activity which was detected in real time. The optimal
ultrasound conditions identified were employed to deliver dye-loaded
nanoparticles as a model for drug-loaded nanocarriers, with the level of
extravasation evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. The same nanoparticles were
then co-injected with submicrometric polymeric cavitation nuclei as a means to
promote cavitation activity and decrease the required in-situ acoustic pressure
required to attain extravasation. The overall cavitation energy and penetration
of the combination was compared to mesoporous silica nanoparticles alone. The
results of the present work suggest that combining mesoporous silica
nanocarriers and submcrometric cavitation nuclei may help enhance the
extravasation of the nanocarrier, thus enabling subsequent sustained drug
release to happen from those particles already embedded in the tumour tissue.

observations that respect dynamic constraints of the vehicle and a total flight
time budget. We provide planning results for simulated temperature modeling for
simple and complex 3D surface geometries (a cylinder and an aircraft model). We
demonstrate that our informative planning method outperforms traditional
approaches such as 3D coverage planning and random exploration, both in
reconstruction error and information-theoretic metrics. We also show that by
taking spatial correlations of the information field into planning using mGPs,
the information gathering efficiency is significantly improved.

investigate nanometric trilayers of Co/X/Pt (X=Ti, Au or Au0:85W0:15) as a

the ultrafast spin current injected in the non-magnetic layer defines a direct
spin conductance, whereas the Gilbert damping leads to an effective spin
mixing-conductance of the trilayer. Importantly, we show that these two
parameters are connected to each other and that spin-memory losses can be
modeled via an effective Hamiltonian with Rashba fields. This work highlights
that magneto-circuits concepts can be successfully extended to ultrafast
spintronic devices, as well as enhancing the understanding of spin-to-charge

relies on a permutation trick which, however, only works within the class of
estimators called Oracle 2. In the present paper, we show that rLHDs are still
beneficial to another class of estimators, called Oracle 1, which often
outperforms Oracle 2 for estimating small and moderate indices. Even though
unlike Oracle 2 the computation cost of Oracle 1 depends on the input
dimension, the permutation trick can be applied to construct an averaged

  Thus, we promote an adaptive rLHDs-based Sobol' sensitivity analysis where
the first stage is to compute the whole set of first-order indices by Oracle 2.
If needed, the accuracy of small and moderate indices can then be reevaluated

attrition, and subsequently small sample size. Alternative methodologies are
therefore warranted. In this study, we used a variational autoencoder to
estimate rates of aging from cross-sectional data from routine laboratory tests
of 1.4 million individuals collected from 2016 to 2019. By incorporating
metrics that would ensure model's stability and distinctness of the dimensions,
we uncovered four aging dimensions that represent the following bodily
functions: 1) kidney, 2) thyroid, 3) white blood cells, and 4) liver and heart.
We then examined the relationship between rates of aging on morbidity and
health care expenditure. In general, faster agers along these dimensions are
more likely to develop chronic diseases that are related to these bodily
functions. They also had higher health care expenditures compared to the slower
agers. K-means clustering of individuals based on rate of aging revealed that
clusters with higher odds of developing morbidity had the highest cost across
all types of health care services. Results suggest that cross-sectional
laboratory data can be leveraged as an alternative methodology to understand
age along the different dimensions. Moreover, rates of aging are differentially
related to future costs, which can aid in the development of interventions to
delay disease progression.

logged-data without access to an environment. While this enables real-world
applications, it also poses unique challenges. One important challenge is
dealing with errors caused by the overestimation of values for state-action
pairs not well-covered by the training data. Due to bootstrapping, these errors
get amplified during training and can lead to divergence, thereby crippling
learning. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Regularized Behavior Value
Estimation (R-BVE). Unlike most approaches, which use policy improvement during
training, R-BVE estimates the value of the behavior policy during training and
only performs policy improvement at deployment time. Further, R-BVE uses a
ranking regularisation term that favours actions in the dataset that lead to
successful outcomes. We provide ample empirical evidence of R-BVE's
effectiveness, including state-of-the-art performance on the RL Unplugged ATARI

adjacent frames to create an intermediate image, this operation should maintain
semantic continuity with the adjacent frames. Most conventional methods use
optical flow, and various tools such as occlusion handling and object smoothing
are indispensable. Since the use of these various tools leads to complex
problems, we tried to tackle the video interframe generation problem without
using problematic optical flow . To enable this , we have tried to use a deep
neural network with an invertible structure, and developed an U-Net based
Generative Flow which is a modified normalizing flow. In addition, we propose a
learning method with a new consistency loss in the latent space to maintain
semantic temporal consistency between frames. The resolution of the generated
image is guaranteed to be identical to that of the original images by using an
invertible network. Furthermore, as it is not a random image like the ones by
generative models, our network guarantees stable outputs without flicker.
Through experiments, we \sam {confirmed the feasibility of the proposed

possibility for baseline in video frame interpolation. This paper is meaningful

in complexity as the dimension of the space increases. For the case of

framework has recently been proposed in which the intersections of a set of
one-dimensional representations, called rays, with the boundaries of the shape
are used to identify the specific geometry. This ray-based classification (RBC)
has been empirically verified using a synthetic dataset of two- and
three-dimensional shapes (Zwolak et al. in Proceedings of Third Workshop on
Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada

validated experimentally (Zwolak et al., PRX Quantum 2:020335, 2021). Here, we
establish a bound on the number of rays necessary for shape classification,
defined by key angular metrics, for arbitrary convex shapes. For two
dimensions, we derive a lower bound on the number of rays in terms of the
shape's length, diameter, and exterior angles. For convex polytopes in
$\mathbb{R}^N$, we generalize this result to a similar bound given as a
function of the dihedral angle and the geometrical parameters of polygonal
faces. This result enables a different approach for estimating high-dimensional

multilingual models that push their ability to handle code-mixed sentences to
the limit. The former uses bilingual dictionaries to propose perturbations and
translations of the clean example for sense disambiguation. The latter directly
aligns the clean example with its translations before extracting phrases as

assets without the approval of trusted third parties. This feature has
encouraged various sectors to make use of smart contracts when transacting.
Experience shows that many deployed contracts are vulnerable to exploitation
due to their poor design, which allows attackers to steal valuable assets from
the involved parties. Therefore, an assessment approach that allows developers
to recognise the consequences of deploying vulnerable contracts is needed. In
this paper, we propose a debt-aware approach for assessing security design
vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our assessment approach involves two main
steps: (i) identification of design vulnerabilities using security analysis
techniques and (ii) an estimation of the ramifications of the identified
vulnerabilities leveraging the technical debt metaphor, its principal and
interest. We use examples of vulnerable contracts to demonstrate the
applicability of our approach. The results show that our assessment approach
increases the visibility of security design issues. It also allows developers
to concentrate on resolving smart contract vulnerabilities through technical
debt impact analysis and prioritisation. Developers can use our approach to
inform the design of more secure contracts and for reducing unintentional debts
caused by a lack of awareness of security issues.

to the common insulating and superfluid phases, other phases (like density

herein explore this possibility, using the graph of a convex polyhedron as

ground-state analysis reveals the existence of insulating ""phases"" with
polyhedral order and a widely extended supersolid region. The key to this
outcome is the unbalance in coordination between inequivalent nodes of the
graph. The predicted phases can be probed in systems of ultracold atoms using

be detected or even fixed fully or partially with automatic tools. However,
recent works explored that there exists a substantial amount of simple yet very
annoying errors in code-bases, which are easy to fix, but hard to detect as
they do not hinder the functionality of the given product in a major way.
Programmers introduce such errors accidentally, mostly due to inattention.
Using the ManySStuBs4J dataset, which contains many simple, stupid bugs, found
in GitHub repositories written in the Java programming language, we
investigated the history of such bugs. We were interested in properties such
as: How long do such bugs stay unnoticed in code-bases? Whether they are
typically fixed by the same developer who introduced them? Are they introduced
with the addition of new code or caused more by careless modification of
existing code? We found that most of such stupid bugs lurk in the code for a
long time before they get removed. We noticed that the developer who made the
mistake seems to find a solution faster, however less then half of SStuBs are
fixed by the same person. We also examined PMD's performance when to came to
flagging lines containing SStuBs, and found that similarly to SpotBugs, it is
insufficient when it comes to finding these types of errors. Examining the
life-cycle of such bugs allows us to better understand their nature and adjust
our development processes and quality assurance methods to better support
avoiding them.

investigation process applying text-mining and machine learning techniques. We
structure this framework using three well-known methods in fraud
investigations: (i) the fraud triangle (ii) the golden (""W"") investigation
questions, and (iii) the analysis of competing hypotheses. With this framework,
it is possible to automatically organize investigative data, so it is easier

identification of the usage of code words by fraudsters. Here for, a novel

long standing and sustained efforts during the past 50 years. In contrast, a
peculiar structural motif, highly unsaturated carbon in a chain-like
arrangement, is instead quite common in space. The recent astronomical
detection of cyanobenzene, the simplest aromatic nitrile, in the dark molecular
cloud TMC-1, and soon afterwards in additional pre-stellar, and possibly
protostellar sources, establishes that aromatic chemistry is likely widespread
in the earliest stages of star formation. The subsequent discovery of
cyanocyclopentadienes and even cyanonapthlenes in TMC-1 provides further
evidence that organic molecules of considerable complexity are readily
synthesized in regions with high visual extinction but where the low

essentially matching the known $2^{O(tw(G))}poly(|V(G)|)$ upper bound up. Our

perturbation problems which limit as some $\epsilon \to 0$ to piecewise-smooth
(PWS) systems which undergo a BEB. This work completes a classification for
codimension-1 singularly perturbed BEB in the plane initiated by the present
authors in [19], using a combination of tools from PWS theory, geometric
singular perturbation theory (GSPT) and a method of geometric desingularization
known as blow-up. After deriving a local normal form capable of generating all
12 singularly perturbed BEBs, we describe the unfolding in each case. Detailed
quantitative results on saddle-node, Andronov-Hopf, homoclinic and
codimension-2 Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations involved in the unfoldings and
classification are presented. Each bifurcation is singular in the sense that it
occurs within a domain which shrinks to zero as $\epsilon \to 0$ at a rate
determined by the rate at which the system loses smoothness. Detailed
asymptotics for a distinguished homoclinic connection which forms the boundary
between two singularly perturbed BEBs in parameter space are also given.
Finally, we describe the explosive onset of oscillations arising in the
unfolding of a particular singularly perturbed boundary-node (BN) bifurcation.
We prove the existence of the oscillations as perturbations of PWS cycles, and
derive a growth rate which is polynomial in $\epsilon$ and dependent on the
rate at which the system loses smoothness. For all the results presented
herein, corresponding results for regularized PWS systems are obtained via the
limit $\epsilon \to 0$.

years due to the exponential increase in the generation of data which can't

short life-span of conventional storage devices. To this end, recent studies
have proven DNA to be a very promising candidate for the long-term storage of
digital data. Several pioneering works have proposed different encoding methods
for the specific encoding of images into a quaternary DNA representation while
first compressing the image using the classical JPEG standard to reduce the
high cost of DNA synthesis. However this type of compression is not optimized
with respect to the quaternary DNA code and results in an open-loop workflow.
In our previous works we have introduced the first closed-loop solution for
generating a constrained fixed-length quaternary code which allows controlling
the synthesis cost thanks to a source allocation algorithm. In this paper, we
extend our studies to proposing a variable-length encoding solution which is

because they predict rare events throughout the game. Besides, it is difficult

more frequently than goals, using player actions and positional data of all
players and the ball. Using data from 45 soccer matches, we examined the
relationship between the proposed index and team performance in actual matches

the true events (mean F1 score $>$ 0.483) better than the existing classifiers
which were based on rare events or goals (mean F1 score $<$ 0.201). Also, the
proposed index had a moderate correlation with the long-term outcomes of the

more reliable indicator rather than winning or losing with the inclusion of
accidental factors.

(represented by a given permutation) will be applied on the system to
reallocate the resources. The goal is to find the optimal control strategies

overcome this difficulty, we introduce a second optimization problem which
provides a suboptimal solution of the initial problem, but whose solution can

psychological characteristics from digital records. To find out whether
automatic personality estimates retain the properties of the original traits,
we reviewed 220 recent articles. First, we put together the predictive quality
estimates from a subset of the studies which declare separation of training,
validation, and testing phases, which is critical for ensuring the correctness
of quality estimates in machine learning. Only 20% of the reviewed papers met
this criterion. To compare the reported quality estimates, we converted them to
approximate Pearson correlations. The credible upper limits for correlations
between predicted and self-reported personality traits vary in a range between
0.42 and 0.48, depending on the specific trait. The achieved values are
substantially below the correlations between traits measured with distinct
self-report questionnaires. This suggests that we cannot readily interpret
personality predictions as estimates of the original traits or expect predicted
personality traits to reproduce known relationships with life outcomes
regularly. Next, we complement quality estimates evaluation with evidence on
psychometric properties of predicted traits. The few existing results suggest
that predicted traits are less stable with time and have lower effective
dimensionality than self-reported personality. The predictive text-based models
perform substantially worse outside their training domains but stay above a
random baseline. The evidence on the relationships between predicted traits and
external variables is mixed. Predictive features are difficult to use for
validation, due to the lack of prior hypotheses. Thus, predicted personality
traits fail to retain important properties of the original characteristics.
This calls for the cautious use and targeted validation of the predictive
models.

answering, Natural Language Inference (NLI) or summarising, have enabled them
to be ranked as one of the best paradigm to address Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks. NLI is one of the best scenarios to test these architectures, due
to the knowledge required to understand complex sentences and established
relationships between a hypothesis and a premise. Nevertheless, these models
suffer from incapacity to generalise to other domains or difficulties to face
multilingual and interlingual scenarios. The leading pathway in the literature
to address these issues involve designing and training extremely large
architectures, which leads to unpredictable behaviours and to establish
barriers which impede broad access and fine tuning. In this paper, we propose a
new architecture called Siamese Inter-Lingual Transformer (SILT), to
efficiently align multilingual embeddings for Natural Language Inference,
allowing for unmatched language pairs to be processed. SILT leverages siamese
pre-trained multi-lingual transformers with frozen weights where the two input
sentences attend each other to later be combined through a matrix alignment
method. The experimental results carried out in this paper evidence that SILT
allows to reduce drastically the number of trainable parameters while allowing
for inter-lingual NLI and achieving state-of-the-art performance on common
benchmarks.

beyond the forward shock (shrapnel). Recent studies have revealed high Si
abundance in two shrapnel (A and G), located in opposite directions with
respect to the SNR center. This suggests the possible existence of a Si-rich
jet-counterjet structure. We analyzed an XMM-Newton observation of a bright
clump, behind shrapnel G, which lies along the direction connecting A and G.
The aim is to study the physical and chemical properties of this clump to
ascertain whether it is part of this putative jet-like structure. We produced
background-corrected and adaptively-smoothed count-rate images and median
photon energy maps, and performed a spatially resolved spectral analysis. We
identified two structures with different physical properties. The first one is
remarkably elongated along the direction connecting A and G. Its X-ray spectrum
is much softer than that of the other two shrapnel, to the point of hindering
the determination of the Si abundance, however its physical and chemical
properties are consistent with those of shrapnel A and G. The second structure,
running along the southeast-northwest direction, has a higher temperature and
appears like a thin filament. By analyzing the ROSAT data, we have found that
this filament is part of a very large and coherent structure that we identified
in the western rim of the shell. We obtained a thorough description of the tail
of Shrapnel G. In addition we discovered a coherent and very extended feature
that we interpret as a signature of an earlier interaction of the remnant with
the stellar wind of its progenitor star. The peculiar Ne/O ratio we found in
the wind residual may be suggestive of a Wolf-Rayet progenitor for Vela SNR,
though further analysis is required to address this point.

With the anticipated arrival of consumer autonomous vehicles, there is demand
for a system which can do this automatically, after deployment and without
specialist human expertise. To solve these limitations, we propose a flexible
framework which can estimate extrinsic parameters without an explicit

builds upon standard hand-eye calibration by jointly recovering scale. Our
second contribution is that our system is made robust to imperfect and
degenerate sensor data, by collecting independent sets of poses and
automatically selecting those which are most ideal. We show that our approach's
robustness is essential for the target scenario. Unlike previous approaches,
ours runs in real time and constantly estimates the extrinsic transform. For
both an ideal experimental setup and a real use case, comparison against these
approaches shows that we outperform the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the recovered scale may be applied to the full trajectory,
circumventing the need for scale estimation via sensor fusion.

habitable zone (HZ) detected around M-dwarf stars in the last years has
revealed these stellar objects to be the key for planetary radial velocity (RV)
searches. Aims. Using the HARPS-N spectrograph within The HArps-n red Dwarf
Exoplanet Survey (HADES) we reach the precision needed to detect small planets
with a few Earth masses using the RV technique. Methods. We obtained 138
HARPS-N RV measurements between 2013 May and 2020 September of GJ 720 A,
classified as an M0.5V star located at a distance of 15.56 pc. To characterize
the stellar variability and to discern the periodic variation due to the
Keplerian signals from those related to stellar activity, the HARPS-N
spectroscopic activity indicators and the simultaneous photometric observations
were analyzed. The combined analysis of HARPS-N RVs and activity indicators let
us to address the nature of the periodic signals. The final model and the
orbital planetary parameters were obtained by fitting simultaneously the
stellar variability and the Keplerian signal using a Gaussian process
regression and following a Bayesian criterion. Results. The HARPS-N RV periodic
signals around 40 d and 100 d have counterparts at the same frequencies in
HARPS-N activity indicators and photometric light curves. Then we attribute
these periodicities to stellar activity the former period being likely
associated with the stellar rotation. GJ 720 A shows the most significant
signal at 19.466$\pm$0.005 d with no counterparts in any stellar activity
indices. We hence ascribe this RV signal, having a semiamplitude of
4.72$\pm$0.27 m/s , to the presence of a sub-Neptune mass planet. The planet GJ
720 Ab has a minimum mass of 13.64$\pm$0.79 M$_{\oplus}$, it is in circular
orbit at 0.119$\pm$0.002 AU from its parent star, and lies inside the inner
boundary of the HZ around its parent star.

reduce the computational overhead brought by the end-to-end model, we introduce
a sparse cross-modal attention mechanism for the feature extraction.
Experimental results show that our fully end-to-end model significantly

etc. are the most widely used queries in the location-based applications.
Building secure and efficient solutions for these queries in the cloud
computing framework is critical and has been an area of active research. This
paper focuses on the problem of Secure Circular Range Queries (SCRQ), where
client submits an encrypted query (consisting of a center point and radius of
the circle) and the cloud (storing encrypted data points) has to return the
points lying inside the circle. The existing solutions for this problem suffer
from various disadvantages such as high processing time which is proportional
to square of the query radius, query generation phase which is directly
proportional to the number of points covered by the query etc. This paper
presents solution for the above problem which is much more efficient than the
existing solutions. Three protocols are proposed with varying characteristics.
It is shown that all the three protocols are secure. The proposed protocols can
be extended to multiple dimensions and thus are able to handle Secure
Hypersphere Range Queries (SHRQ) as well. Internally the proposed protocols use
pairing-based cryptography and a concept of lookup table. To enable the
efficient use of limited size lookup table, a new storage scheme is presented.
The proposed storage scheme enables the protocols to handle query with much
larger radius values. Using the SHRQ protocols, we also propose a mechanism to
answer the Secure range Queries. Extensive performance evaluation has been done
to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed protocols

However, the low value of $\log{g} = 3.8$ determined via spectroscopic

consistent with it being on the pre-main sequence. The rotational period
inferred from the variability of the H$\alpha$ line and the longitudinal
magnetic field $\langle B_z \rangle$ is 1.13 d. Modelling of Stokes $V$ and
$\langle B_z \rangle$ indicates a surface dipolar magnetic field $B_{\rm d}$
between 6 and $11$ kG. With its strong emission, rapid rotation, and strong

work, we use a Comptonisation model to study the frequency dependence of the
phase lags of the type-C QPO in the BH LMXB GRS 1915+105. The phase lags of the
QPO in GRS 1915+105 make a transition from hard to soft at a QPO frequency of
around 1.8 Hz. Our model shows that at high QPO frequencies a large corona of ~
100-150 R_g covers most of the accretion disc and makes it 100% feedback
dominated, thus producing soft lags. As the observed QPO frequency decreases,
the corona gradually shrinks down to around 3-17 R_g, and at 1.8 Hz feedback
onto the disc becomes inefficient leading to hard lags. We discuss how changes
in the accretion geometry affect the timing properties of the type-C QPO.

prove that the particle flows are unbiased under the assumption of linear

their spectral shapes in terms of multi-band radio spectral indices. Finding
strong spectral flattening at low frequencies in ~20% of sources, we
investigate the differences between sources with extremely flat low-frequency

statistically significant differences between the two subgroups of our sample
as split by the radio spectral index, we suggest that any differences are
undetectable in galaxy-averaged properties that we can observe with our
unresolved images, and likely relate to galaxy properties that we cannot
resolve, on scales $\lesssim$ 1 kpc. We attribute the observed spectral
flattening in the radio to free-free absorption, proposing that those sources
with significant low-frequency spectral flattening have a clumpy distribution
of star-forming gas. We estimate an average spatial extent of absorbing
material of at most several hundred parsecs to produce the levels of absorption
observed in the radio spectra. This estimate is consistent with the
highest-resolution observations of submillimetre galaxies in the literature,
which find examples of non-uniform dust distributions on scales of ~100 pc,
with evidence for clumps and knots in the interstellar medium. Additionally, we
find two bright (> 6 mJy) submm sources undetected at all other wavelengths. We
speculate that these objects may be very high redshift sources, likely residing

graphs in constant dimension $d$. Although the single-source and all-pairs
variants of this problem are well-studied in the plane case, no non-trivial
exact distance oracles for unit-disk graphs have been known to date, even for
$d=2$.
  The classical result of Sedgewick and Vitter [Algorithmica '86] shows that
for weighted unit-disk graphs in the plane the $A^*$ search has average-case
performance superior to that of a standard shortest path algorithm, e.g.,
Dijkstra's algorithm. Specifically, if the $n$ corresponding points of a
weighted unit-disk graph $G$ are picked from a unit square uniformly at random,
and the connectivity radius is $r\in (0,1)$, $A^*$ finds a shortest path in $G$
in $O(n)$ expected time when $r=\Omega(\sqrt{\log n/n})$, even though $G$ has
$\Theta((nr)^2)$ edges in expectation. In other words, the work done by the
algorithm is in expectation proportional to the number of vertices and not the
number of edges.
  In this paper, we break this natural barrier and show even stronger sublinear
time results. We propose a new heuristic approach to computing point-to-point
exact shortest paths in unit-disk graphs. We analyze the average-case behavior
of our heuristic using the same random graph model as used by Sedgewick and
Vitter and prove it superior to $A^*$. Specifically, we show that, if we are
able to report the set of all $k$ points of $G$ from an arbitrary rectangular
region of the plane in $O(k + t(n))$ time, then a shortest path between
arbitrary two points of such a random graph on the plane can be found in
$O(1/r^2 + t(n))$ expected time. In particular, the state-of-the-art range
reporting data structures imply a sublinear expected bound for all
$r=\Omega(\sqrt{\log n/n})$ and $O(\sqrt{n})$ expected bound for
$r=\Omega(n^{-1/4})$ after only near-linear preprocessing of the point set.

interfaces that respects the underlying crystallography of the two

mechanisms of interface motion; i.e., disconnection migration (line defects in
the interface with step and dislocation character). We derive the equation of
motion for interface migration under the influence of a wide range of driving
forces. In Part II of this paper [Salvalaglio, Han and Srolovitz, 2021], we
implement the interface model and the equation of motion proposed in this paper

  breastfeeding: Evidence from Mali",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Why do people engage in certain behavior. What are the effects of social
expectations and perceptions of community behavior and beliefs on own behavior.
Given that proper infant feeding practices are observable and have significant
health impacts, we explore the relevance of these questions in the context of
exclusive infant breastfeeding behavior using social norms theory. We make use
of a primary survey of mothers of children below the age of two years in the
Kayes and Sikasso region of Mali, which have a historically lower prevalence of
exclusive breastfeeding. The findings from regression estimations, controlling
for a host of potential confounding factors, indicate that expectations about
the behavior of other community members can strongly predict individual
exclusive breastfeeding. Beliefs about approval of the infant feeding behavior
of the community though are found to be only modestly associated with it. In
addition, mothers who hold false but positive beliefs about the community are
found to exclusively breastfeed their kids. Further, using responses from
randomly assigned vignettes where we experimentally manipulated the levels of
social expectations, our data reveal a strong relationship between perceived
prevalence of community level exclusive breastfeeding and individual behavior.
This result indicates the existence of a potential causal relationship. We
argue that our findings represent an important foundation for the design of
policy interventions aimed at altering social expectations, and thus effecting
a measurable change in individual behaviors. This type of intervention, by
using social norm messaging to end negative behavior, avoids the use of
coercive measures to effect behavior change in a cost-effective and efficient
way.

typically represent the dynamics of disease transmission between individuals

variability. To address this issue, we present a dynamic network model that
provides a straightforward way to incorporate both disease transmission
dynamics at the individual scale as well as the full spatiotemporal history of
infection at the population scale. We find that disease spreads through a
social network as a traveling wave of infection, followed by a traveling wave
of recovery, with the onset and dynamics of spreading determined by the
interplay between disease transmission and recovery. We use these insights to
develop a scaling theory that predicts the dynamics of infection for diverse
diseases and populations. Furthermore, we show how spatial heterogeneities in
susceptibility to infection can either exacerbate or quell the spread of
disease, depending on its infectivity. Ultimately, our dynamic network approach
provides a simple way to model disease spreading that unifies previous findings
and can be generalized to diverse diseases, containment strategies, seasonal
conditions, and community structures.

optimization and constraint satisfaction. However, the heavy computation of the
Optimal Control Problem (OCP) at each triggering instant brings the serious
delay from state sampling to the control signals, which limits the applications
of MPC in resource-limited robot manipulator systems over complicated tasks. In
this paper, we propose a novel robust tube-based smooth-MPC strategy for
nonlinear robot manipulator planning systems with disturbances and constraints.
Based on piecewise linearization and state prediction, our control strategy
improves the smoothness and optimizes the delay of the control process. By
deducing the deviation of the real system states and the nominal system states,
we can predict the next real state set at the current instant. And by using
this state set as the initial condition, we can solve the next OCP ahead and
store the optimal controls based on the nominal system states, which eliminates
the delay. Furthermore, we linearize the nonlinear system with a given upper
bound of error, reducing the complexity of the OCP and improving the response
speed. Based on the theoretical framework of tube MPC, we prove that the
control strategy is recursively feasible and closed-loop stable with the
constraints and disturbances. Numerical simulations have verified the efficacy
of the designed approach compared with the conventional MPC.

Based on the studies of Hall coefficient and chemical-substitution effect, we
have clarified the origin for the unusual temperature dependence of
out-of-plane resistivity $\rho_c(T)$ in the high-temperature
paramagnetic-tetragonal phase. Electron (hole) carriers have an incoherent
(coherent) character, which is responsible for non-metallic (metallic)
$\rho_c(T)$. Although both of electron and hole contributions are almost
comparable, a slightly larger contribution comes from electrons at high
temperatures, while from holes at low temperatures, resulting in a maximum in
$\rho_c(T)$. In the low-temperature antiferromagnetic-orthorhombic phase, the
major effect of substitution is to increase the residual-resistivity component,
as in the case for the in-plane transport. In particular, Co atoms substituted
for Fe give rise to strong scattering with large $\mathit{ac}$ anisotropy. We
found that K substitution induces a non-metallic behavior in $\rho_c(T)$ at low
temperatures, which is likely due to a weakly localized nature along the
$c$-axis direction.

amplify the level of protection. For example, for $\epsilon$-differential
privacy and simple random sampling with sampling rate $r$, the actual privacy
guarantee is approximately $r\epsilon$, if a value of $\epsilon$ is used to
protect the output from the sample. In this paper, we study whether this
amplification effect can be exploited systematically to improve the accuracy of

certain regimes. However, gains can typically only be expected, if the
sensitivity of the output with respect to small changes in the database does
not depend too strongly on the size of the database. We only focus on
algorithms that achieve differential privacy by adding noise to the final

  implicit measures",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Western tonality provides a hierarchy of stability among melodic
scale-degrees, from the maximally stable tonic to unstable chromatic notes.
Tonal stability has been linked to emotion, yet systematic investigations of
the associations between the hierarchy of melodic scale-degrees and perceived
emotional valence are lacking. Here, we examined such associations in three
experiments, in musicians and in non-musicians. We used an explicit task, in
which participants matched probe tones following key-establishing sequences to
facial expressions ranging from sad to happy, and an implicit speeded task, a
variant of the Implicit Association Test. Stabler scale-degrees were associated
with more positive valence in all experiments, for both musicians and
nonmusicians. This notwithstanding, results significantly differed from those
of a comparable goodness-of-fit task, suggesting that perceived tonal valence
is not reducible to tonal fit. Comparisons of the explicit and implicit
measures suggest that associations of tonality and emotional valence may rely
on two distinct mechanisms, one mediated by conceptual musical knowledge and
conscious decisional processes, the other - largely by non-conceptual and
involuntary processes. The joint experimental paradigms introduced here may
help mapping additional connotative meanings, both emotional and cross-modal,
embedded in tonal structure, thus suggesting how extra-musical meanings are
conveyed to listeners through musical syntax.

astronomy, and identifying fine structures of galaxies (e.g., spiral arms,
bars, and clumps) is an essential ingredient in such a classification task.
However, seeing effects can cause images we obtain to appear blurry, making it
difficult for astronomers to derive galaxies' physical properties and, in
particular, distant galaxies. Here, we present a method that converts blurred
images obtained by the ground-based Subaru Telescope into quasi Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) images via machine learning. Using an existing deep learning
method called generative adversarial networks (GANs), we can eliminate seeing
effects, effectively resulting in an image similar to an image taken by the
HST. Using multiple Subaru telescope image and HST telescope image pairs, we
demonstrate that our model can augment fine structures present in the blurred
images in aid for better and more precise galactic classification. Using our
first of its kind machine learning-based deblurring technique on space images,
we can obtain up to 18% improvement in terms of CW-SSIM (Complex Wavelet
Structural Similarity Index) score when comparing the Subaru-HST pair versus
SeeingGAN-HST pair. With this model, we can generate HST-like images from
relatively less capable telescopes, making space exploration more accessible to
the broader astronomy community. Furthermore, this model can be used not only
in professional morphological classification studies of galaxies but in all
citizen science for galaxy classifications.

digital treasuries at excessive risks. This leads to an urgent call for an
effective intrusion detection system that can identify the intrusion attacks
with high accuracy. It is challenging to classify the intrusion events due to
the wide variety of attacks. Furthermore, in a normal network environment, a
majority of the connections are initiated by benign behaviors. The class
imbalance issue in intrusion detection forces the classifier to be biased
toward the majority/benign class, thus leave many attack incidents undetected.
Spurred by the success of deep neural networks in computer vision and natural
language processing, in this paper, we design a new system named DeepIDEA that
takes full advantage of deep learning to enable intrusion detection and
classification. To achieve high detection accuracy on imbalanced data, we
design a novel attack-sharing loss function that can effectively move the
decision boundary towards the attack classes and eliminates the bias towards
the majority/benign class. By using this loss function, DeepIDEA respects the
fact that the intrusion mis-classification should receive higher penalty than
the attack mis-classification. Extensive experimental results on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the high detection accuracy of DeepIDEA. In
particular, compared with eight state-of-the-art approaches, DeepIDEA always
provides the best class-balanced accuracy.

parameterizations, finding arbitrarily large optimal solutions in time $f(w)
\cdot n^{O(1)}$ for some width measure $w$ like treewidth. We unify these lines
of research by presenting FPT algorithms for parameterizations that can
simultaneously be arbitrarily much smaller than the solution size and the
treewidth.
  We consider two classes of parameterizations which are relaxations of either
treedepth of treewidth. They are related to graph decompositions in which
subgraphs that belong to a target class H (e.g., bipartite or planar) are
considered simple. First, we present a framework for computing approximately
optimal decompositions for miscellaneous classes H. Namely, if the cost of an
optimal decomposition is $k$, we show how to find a decomposition of cost
$k^{O(1)}$ in time $f(k) \cdot n^{O(1)}$. This is applicable to any graph class
H for which the corresponding vertex-deletion problem admits a constant-factor
approximation algorithm or an FPT algorithm paramaterized by the solution size.
Secondly, we exploit the constructed decompositions for solving vertex-deletion
problems by extending ideas from algorithms using iterative compression and the
finite state property. For the three mentioned vertex-deletion problems, and
all problems which can be formulated as hitting a finite set of connected
forbidden (a) minors or (b) (induced) subgraphs, we obtain FPT algorithms with

novel method for quantitatively clarifying the status of single unit in CNN
using algebraic topological tools. Unit status is indicated via the calculation
of a defined topological-based entropy, called feature entropy, which measures
the degree of chaos of the global spatial pattern hidden in the unit for a
category. In this way, feature entropy could provide an accurate indication of
status for units in different networks with diverse situations like
weight-rescaling operation. Further, we show that feature entropy decreases as
the layer goes deeper and shares almost simultaneous trend with loss during
training. We show that by investigating the feature entropy of units on only

e.g. a set of files, and to define the order of migration of them along the
migration process. To our knowledge, there is no approach to support developers
on those activities. Objective: This paper presents an approach, named
MigrationExp, to support incremental language migrations of applications from
one source language to another target language. MigrationExp recommends the
files that should be migrated first in a particular migration iteration. As a
novelty, our approach relies on a ranking model learned, using a
learning-to-rank algorithm, from migrations made by developers. Method: We
validate our approach in the context of the migrations of Android apps, from
Java to Kotlin, a new official language for Android. We train our model using
migrations of Java code to Kotlin written by developers on open-source
applications. Results: The results show that, on the task of proposing files to
migrate, our approach outperforms a previous migration strategy proposed by
Google, in terms of its ability to accurately predict empirically observed
migration orders. Conclusion: Since most Android applications are written in
Java, we conclude that approaches to support developers such as MigrationExp
may significantly impact the development of Android applications.

preserves distances up to an additive $+\beta$ error. Additive spanners are
well-studied in unweighted graphs but have only recently received attention in
weighted graphs [Elkin et al.\ 2019 and 2020, Ahmed et al.\ 2020]. This paper
makes two new contributions to the theory of weighted additive spanners.
  For weighted graphs, [Ahmed et al.\ 2020] provided constructions of sparse
spanners with \emph{global} error $\beta = cW$, where $W$ is the maximum edge
weight in $G$ and $c$ is constant. We improve these to \emph{local} error by
giving spanners with additive error $+cW(s,t)$ for each vertex pair $(s,t)$,
where $W(s, t)$ is the maximum edge weight along the shortest $s$--$t$ path in
$G$. These include pairwise $+(2+\eps)W(\cdot,\cdot)$ and $+(6+\eps) W(\cdot,
\cdot)$ spanners over vertex pairs $\Pc \subseteq V \times V$ on
$O_{\eps}(n|\Pc|^{1/3})$ and $O_{\eps}(n|\Pc|^{1/4})$ edges for all $\eps > 0$,
which extend previously known unweighted results up to $\eps$ dependence, as
well as an all-pairs $+4W(\cdot,\cdot)$ spanner on $\widetilde{O}(n^{7/5})$
edges.
  Besides sparsity, another natural way to measure the quality of a spanner in
weighted graphs is by its \emph{lightness}, defined as the total edge weight of
the spanner divided by the weight of an MST of $G$. We provide a $+\eps
W(\cdot,\cdot)$ spanner with $O_{\eps}(n)$ lightness, and a $+(4+\eps)
W(\cdot,\cdot)$ spanner with $O_{\eps}(n^{2/3})$ lightness. These are the first
known additive spanners with nontrivial lightness guarantees. All of the above
spanners can be constructed in polynomial time.

bursts, such as the ones detected after a supernova. It exploits the temporal

defining a ""Real-time Test Statistic"" (RTS) that would allow identifying very
weak signals, hard to select using standard clustering methods. For a given
background rate, the new method (RTS$^2$: RTS for Supernovae) increases signal
efficiency while keeping the same false alarm rate for Poisson-distributed
background. By adding a spatial penalty term to the definition of RTS, one can
also reject spatially-correlated backgrounds such as the ones due to spallation
events. Furthermore, the method is easy to implement in a real-time monitoring
system as RTS can be computed recursively for successive events, and it can be
easily adapted for detectors of all scales that may want to send prompt alerts

axis-aligned rectangular items and an axis-aligned square-shaped knapsack. Each
item has integral width, integral height and an associated integral profit. The
goal is to find a (non-overlapping axis-aligned) packing of a maximum profit
subset of rectangles into the knapsack. A well-studied and frequently used
constraint in practice is to allow only packings that are guillotine separable,
i.e., every rectangle in the packing can be obtained by recursively applying a
sequence of edge-to-edge axis-parallel cuts that do not intersect any item of
the solution. In this paper we study approximation algorithms for the geometric
knapsack problem under guillotine cut constraints. We present polynomial time
(1 + {\epsilon})-approximation algorithms for the cases with and without
allowing rotations by 90 degrees, assuming that all input numeric data are
polynomially bounded in n. In comparison, the best-known approximation factor
for this setting is 3 + {\epsilon} [Jansen-Zhang, SODA 2004], even in the
cardinality case where all items have the same profit. Our main technical
contribution is a structural lemma which shows that any guillotine packing can
be converted into another structured guillotine packing with almost the same
profit. In this packing, each item is completely contained in one of a constant
number of boxes and L-shaped regions, inside which the items are placed by a
simple greedy routine. In particular, we provide a clean sufficient condition
when such a packing obeys the guillotine cut constraints which might be useful
for other settings where these constraints are imposed.

this behavior like being tired or inexperienced. The simulation environment

gradient-based learning with an unsupervised rule on pre-synpatic activity,
post-synaptic activities, and current weights. We test HAT's effect on a simple

supervised learning alone. This finding provides empirical evidence that
unsupervised learning on synaptic activities provides a strong signal that can
be used to augment gradient-based methods.
  We further find that the meta-learned update rule is a time-varying function;
thus, it is difficult to pinpoint an interpretable Hebbian update rule that
aids in training. We do find that the meta-learner eventually degenerates into
a non-Hebbian rule that preserves important weights so as not to disturb the

filling some gaps in the current group database in the earliest period where
the data available is sparse. Moreover, we have detected changes in the quality
of the sunspot drawings made by Galileo and Scheiner in their observation

compare these records with sunspot observations made by other astronomers of
that time. According to this comparison and regarding the same observation

while Harriot, Cigoli, and Galileo recorded a similar number of groups. We
conclude these differences are mainly because of the observational method used

their corresponding confidence intervals (CIs), are the three most common
estimators of parameters of Generalized Linear Models. On finite samples, these
estimators are biased. The objective of this work is to analyze the coverage
errors of the CI estimators in small samples for the log-Poisson model (i.e.
estimation of incidence rate ratio) with innovative evaluation criteria, taking
in account the overestimation/underestimation unbalance of coverage errors and
the variable inclusion rate and follow-up in epidemiological studies.
  METHODS: Exact calculations equivalent to Monte Carlo simulations with an
infinite number of simulations have been used. Underestimation errors (due to
the upper bound of the CI) and overestimation coverage errors (due to the lower
bound of the CI) have been split. The level of confidence has been analyzed
from $0.95$ to $1-10^{-6}$, allowing the interpretation of P-values below
$10^{-6}$ for hypothesis tests.
  RESULTS: The LR bias was small (actual coverage errors less than 1.5 times
the nominal errors) when the expected number of events in both groups was above
1, even when unbalanced (e.g. 10 events in one group vs 1 in the other). For
95% CI, Wald's and the Score estimators showed high bias even when the number
of events was large ($\geq 20$ in both groups) when groups were unbalanced. For
small P-values ($<10^{-6}$), the LR kept acceptable bias while Wald's and the
score P-values had severely inflated errors ($\times 100$).
  CONCLUSION: The LR test and LR CI should be used.

  Materials & methods: Google Scholar was used for bibliographic research.
Evaluation criteria were (i) one-sided conditional errors, (ii) one-sided local
average errors assuming a random theoretical proportion and (iii) expected
half-widths of CIs.
  Results: Wald's CI did not control any of the risks, even when the expected
number of successes reached 32. The likelihood ratio CI had a better balance
than the logistic Wald CI. The Clopper-Pearson mid-P CI controlled well
one-sided local average errors whereas the simple Clopper-Pearson CI was
strictly conservative on both one-sided conditional errors. The percentile and
basic bootstrap CIs had the same bias order as Wald's CI whereas the
studentized CIs and BCa, modified for discrete bootstrap distributions, were
less biased but not as efficient as the parametric methods. The half-widths of

it reveals and makes contribution to much simpler justifications on the notion
of zero factorial to be one when compared to previous studies in the area.
Second, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed justifications, an online

illustrated. Elaborating on the first contribution, we note that the connection
of zero factorial to the definition of the gamma function provides a first-hand
conceptual understanding of the concept of zero factorial. But for the purpose
of teaching, it is not particularly helpful from the pedagogical point of view
in early years of study, as it is quite challenging to explain the rationale
behind the origin of the definite integral that defines the gamma function. In
this regard two algebraic and one statistical justification are presented. The
squeeze theorem plays a pivotal role in this article. To assess the

a novel mixed DRL-convex optimization method in which analog beamsteering
between APs and UEs is conducted based on DRL while digital beamforming is
modeled and solved as a convex optimization problem. The DRL models for network
clustering and hybrid beamsteering are combined into a single hierarchical DRL

people look forward to a higher level of understanding and reasoning about
visual scenes. For example, given an image, we want to not only detect and
recognize objects in the image, but also know the relationship between objects
(visual relationship detection), and generate a text description (image

machine to tell us what the little girl in the image is doing (Visual Question

such a powerful tool for scene understanding. Therefore, scene graphs have
attracted the attention of a large number of researchers, and related research

Skip-scSE applies spatial and channel-wise excitation to signify the essential
features and reduces the sparsity in deeper layers learning parameters using
skip connections. The proposed approaches are evaluated by comparative
experiments with state-of-the-art models in synthesis, segmentation, and
overall survival (OS) prediction. We observe that adding missing MRI modality
improves the segmentation prediction, and expression levels of gene markers
have a high contribution in the GBM prognosis prediction, and fused
radiogenomic features boost the OS estimation.

challenges faced by Motor Imagery (MI) decoding algorithms for
electroencephalogram (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). To address
these challenges, inspired from neuro-physiological signatures of MI, this
paper proposes a novel Filter-Bank Convolutional Network (FBCNet) for MI
classification. FBCNet employs a multi-view data representation followed by
spatial filtering to extract spectro-spatially discriminative features. This
multistage approach enables efficient training of the network even when limited
training data is available. More significantly, in FBCNet, we propose a novel
Variance layer that effectively aggregates the EEG time-domain information.
With this design, we compare FBCNet with state-of-the-art (SOTA) BCI algorithm
on four MI datasets: The BCI competition IV dataset 2a (BCIC-IV-2a), the
OpenBMI dataset, and two large datasets from chronic stroke patients. The
results show that, by achieving 76.20% 4-class classification accuracy, FBCNet
sets a new SOTA for BCIC-IV-2a dataset. On the other three datasets, FBCNet
yields up to 8% higher binary classification accuracies. Additionally, using
explainable AI techniques we present one of the first reports about the
differences in discriminative EEG features between healthy subjects and stroke
patients. Also, the FBCNet source code is available at

healthcare, including surgery outcomes. However, the causal pathway underlying
disparities at preoperative physical condition of children is not
well-understood. This research aims to uncover the role of socioeconomic and
environmental factors in racial disparities at the preoperative physical
condition of children through multidimensional integration of several data
sources at the patient and population level. After the data integration process
an unsupervised k-means algorithm on neighborhood quality metrics was developed
to split 29 zip-codes from Memphis, TN into good and poor-quality
neighborhoods. An unadjusted comparison of African Americans and white children
showed that the prevalence of poor preoperative condition is significantly
higher among African Americans compared to whites. No statistically significant
difference in surgery outcome was present when adjusted by surgical severity
and neighborhood quality. The socioenvironmental factors affect the
preoperative clinical condition of children and their surgical outcomes.

telepresence are suffering from discrepancies in the boundary area and
spatial-temporal inconsistency due to the illumination variation in the video
frames. The aim behind this work is to propose a new solution that helps
produce the composite video by merging the augmented video of the surgery site
and the virtual hand of the remote expertise surgeon. The purpose of the
proposed solution is to decrease the processing time and enhance the accuracy
of merged video by decreasing the overlay and visualization error and removing
occlusion and artefacts. Methodology: The proposed system enhanced the mean
value cloning algorithm that helps to maintain the spatial-temporal consistency
of the final composite video. The enhanced algorithm includes the 3D mean value
coordinates and improvised mean value interpolant in the image cloning process,
which helps to reduce the sawtooth, smudging and discolouration artefacts
around the blending region. Results: As compared to the state of the art
solution, the accuracy in terms of overlay error of the proposed solution is
improved from 1.01mm to 0.80mm whereas the accuracy in terms of visualization
error is improved from 98.8% to 99.4%. The processing time is reduced to 0.173
seconds from 0.211 seconds. Conclusion: Our solution helps make the object of
interest consistent with the light intensity of the target image by adding the
space distance that helps maintain the spatial consistency in the final merged
video.

algorithm for particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithms using Gaussian mixtures (GM).
The algorithm features a particle compression stage and a particle
reconstruction stage, where a continuum particle distribution function is
constructed and resampled, respectively. To guarantee fidelity of the CR
process, we ensure the exact preservation of charge, momentum, and energy for
both compression and reconstruction stages, everywhere on the mesh. We also
ensure the preservation of Gauss' law after particle reconstruction. As a
result, the GM CR algorithm is shown to provide a clean, conservative restart
capability while potentially affording orders of magnitude savings in
input/output requirements. We demonstrate the algorithm using a recently
developed exactly energy- and charge-conserving PIC algorithm on physical
problems of interest, with compression factors $\gtrsim75$ with no appreciable
impact on the quality of the restarted dynamics.
