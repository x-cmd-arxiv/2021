by analyzing numerical simulations of the quiet solar atmosphere, using the
radiative magnetohydrodynamic code CO$5$BOLD. We are interested in finding
their relation with magnetic field perturbations and in the processes driving
their evolution. For the analysis, the swirling strength criterion and its
evolution equation are applied in order to identify vortical motions and to
study their dynamics. We introduce a new criterion, the magnetic swirling
strength, which allows us to recognize torsional perturbations in the magnetic
field. We find a strong correlation between swirling strength and magnetic
swirling strength, in particular in intense magnetic flux concentrations, which
suggests a tight relation between vortical motions and torsional magnetic field
perturbations. Furthermore, we find that swirls propagate upward with the local
Alfv\'en speed as unidirectional swirls, in the form of pulses, driven by
magnetic tension forces alone. In the photosphere and low chromosphere, the
rotation of the plasma co-occurs with a twist in the upwardly directed magnetic
field that is in the opposite direction of the plasma flow. All together, these
are characteristics of torsional Alfv\'en waves. We also find indications of an
imbalance between the hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic baroclinic effects
being at the origin of the swirls. At the base of the chromosphere, we find a
net upwardly directed Poynting flux, which is mostly associated with large and
complex swirling structures that we interpret as the superposition of various
small-scale vortices. We conclude that the ubiquitous swirling events observed
in simulations are tightly correlated with perturbations of the magnetic field.
At photospheric and chromospheric levels, they form Alfv\'en pulses that
propagate upward and may contribute to chromospheric heating.

focuses on an online model in which there are two locations: 0 and 1, and $k$
total cars. Each request which specifies its pick-up time and pick-up location
(among 0 and 1, and the other is the drop-off location) is released in each
stage a fixed amount of time before its specified start (i.e. pick-up) time.
The time between the booking (i.e. released) time and the start time is enough
to move empty cars between 0 and 1 for relocation if they are not used in that
stage. The model, called $k$S2L-F, assumes that requests in each stage arrive
sequentially regardless of the same booking time and the decision (accept or
reject) must be made immediately. The goal is to accept as many requests as
possible. In spite of only two locations, the analysis does not seem easy and
the (tight) competitive ratio (CR) is only known to be 2.0 for $k=2$ and 1.5
for a restricted value of $k$, i.e., a multiple of three. In this paper, we
remove all the holes of unknown CR's; namely we prove that the CR is
$\frac{2k}{k + \lfloor k/3 \rfloor}$ for all $k\geq 2$. Furthermore, if the
algorithm can delay its decision until all requests have come in each stage,
the CR is improved to roughly 4/3. We can take this advantage even further,
precisely we can achieve a CR of $\frac{2+R}{3}$ if the number of requests in
each stage is at most $Rk$, $1 \leq R \leq 2$, where we do not have to know the
value of $R$ in advance. Finally we demonstrate that randomization also helps
to get (slightly) better CR's.

aims to generate annotations without human supervision. Recent advances focus
on the use of self-supervised learning strategies in image clustering, by first
learning valuable semantics and then clustering the image representations.
These multiple-phase algorithms, however, increase the computational time and
their final performance is reliant on the first stage. By extending the
self-supervised approach, we propose a novel single-phase clustering method
that simultaneously learns meaningful representations and assigns the
corresponding annotations. This is achieved by integrating a discrete
representation into the self-supervised paradigm through a classifier net.
Specifically, the proposed clustering objective employs mutual information, and
maximizes the dependency between the integrated discrete representation and a
discrete probability distribution. The discrete probability distribution is
derived though the self-supervised process by comparing the learnt latent
representation with a set of trainable prototypes. To enhance the learning
performance of the classifier, we jointly apply the mutual information across
multi-crop views. Our empirical results show that the proposed framework
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with the average accuracy of 89.1% and
49.0%, respectively, on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100/20 datasets. Finally, the
proposed method also demonstrates attractive robustness to parameter settings,
making it ready to be applicable to other datasets.

The ability to rigorously test these models is therefore essential. In this

How is a verdict assigned to a generated test? How is the adequacy of a

model is targeted by a generated test? Our results show that whilst the
majority of techniques are effective for testing functional requirements at the
agent and integration levels of abstraction, there are comparatively few

identify a need for more thorough evaluation using realistic case studies that

results indicate that it is possible to compress the spectral line profiles
more than 27 times (which corresponds to the reduction of the data

$d(u,w)$ denote the length of a $u-w$ geodesic in $G$. For any $v\in V(G)$ and
$e=xy\in E(G)$, let $d(e,v)=\min\{d(x,v),d(y,v)\}$. For distinct $e_1, e_2\in
E(G)$, let $R\{e_1,e_2\}=\{z\in V(G):d(z,e_1)\neq d(z,e_2)\}$. Kelenc et al.
[Discrete Appl. Math. 251 (2018) 204-220] introduced the edge dimension of a
graph: A vertex subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is an edge resolving set of $G$ if
$|S\cap R\{e_1,e_2\}|\ge 1$ for any distinct $e_1, e_2\in E(G)$, and the edge
dimension $edim(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum cardinality among all edge resolving
sets of $G$.
  For a real-valued function $g$ defined on $V(G)$ and for $U\subseteq V(G)$,
let $g(U)=\sum_{s\in U}g(s)$. Then $g:V(G)\rightarrow[0,1]$ is an edge
resolving function of $G$ if $g(R\{e_1,e_2\})\ge1$ for any distinct $e_1,e_2\in
E(G)$. The fractional edge dimension $edim_f(G)$ of $G$ is
$\min\{g(V(G)):g\mbox{ is an edge resolving function of }G\}$. Note that
$edim_f(G)$ reduces to $edim(G)$ if the codomain of edge resolving functions is
restricted to $\{0,1\}$.
  We introduce and study fractional edge dimension and obtain some general
results on the edge dimension of graphs. We show that there exist two
non-isomorphic graphs on the same vertex set with the same edge metric
coordinates. We construct two graphs $G$ and $H$ such that $H \subset G$ and
both $edim(H)-edim(G)$ and $edim_f(H)-edim_f(G)$ can be arbitrarily large. We
show that a graph $G$ with $edim(G)=2$ cannot have $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ as a
subgraph, and we construct a non-planar graph $H$ satisfying $edim(H)=2$. It is
easy to see that, for any connected graph $G$ of order $n\ge3$, $1\le edim_f(G)
\le \frac{n}{2}$; we characterize graphs $G$ satisfying $edim_f(G)=1$ and
examine some graph classes satisfying $edim_f(G)=\frac{n}{2}$. We also
determine the fractional edge dimension for some classes of graphs.

for flows in heterogeneous porous media. We propose here new interface spaces,
which are based on physics, to deal with permeability fields in the

the pressure and flux spaces. Existing multiscale methods based on mixed

allows for the independent choice of the pressure and flux interface spaces. An
adaptive version of the MRCM [Rocha, et al., J. Comput. Phys., 409 (2020),
109316] is considered that automatically selects the physics-based pressure
space for fractured structures and the physics-based flux space for regions
with barriers, resulting in a procedure with unprecedented accuracy. The
features of the proposed approach are investigated through several numerical
simulations of single-phase and two-phase flows, in different heterogeneous

fully-resolved simulations, from creeping-flow conditions to strongly inertial
regimes. The investigation focuses on the way the body aspect ratio $\chi$
(defined as as the length-to-diameter ratio), the inclination angle $\theta$
with respect to the incoming flow and the Reynolds number $\text{Re}$ (based on
the cylinder diameter) affect the flow structure past the body and therefore
the hydrodynamic loads acting on it. The configuration $\theta=0^\circ$ (where
the cylinder is aligned with the flow) is considered first, from creeping-flow
conditions up to $\text{Re}=400$, with aspect ratios up to $20$ ($10$) for
$\text{Re}\leq10$ ($\text{Re}\geq10$). In the low-to-moderate Reynolds number
regime ($\text{Re}\lesssim5$), influence or the aspect ratio, inclination (from
$0^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}$), and inertial effects is examined by comparing
numerical results for the axial and transverse force components and the
spanwise torque with theoretical predictions based on the slender-body
approximation, possibly incorporating finite-Reynolds-number corrections.
Semiempirical models based on these predictions and incorporating finite-length
and inertial corrections extracted from the numerical data are derived. For
large enough Reynolds numbers ($\text{Re}\gtrsim10^2$), separation takes place

purposely designed to simulate complex hybrid heterostructures, with

suitable to describe the polarization-induced renormalization of frontier

reliably applied to simulating laser-induced ultrafast dynamics of the

Fresnel-reflection at the substrate. Depending on the complexity of the
underlying layer structure, such reflected fields can assume non-trivial shapes
and profoundly affect the dynamics of the photo-excited charge carriers in the
molecule. In particular, the interaction with the substrate can give rise to
strong delayed fields which lead to interference effects resembling those of
multi-pulse-based spectroscopy. The robustness of the implementation and the
above-mentioned features are demonstrated with a number of examples, ranging

adversarial networks (SRGANs) as a methodology for the reconstruction of
turbulent-flow quantities from coarse wall measurements. The method is applied
both for the resolution enhancement of wall fields and the estimation of
wall-parallel velocity fields from coarse wall measurements of shear stress and
pressure. The analysis has been carried out with a database of a turbulent
open-channel flow with friction Reynolds number $Re_{\tau}=180$ generated
through direct numerical simulation. Coarse wall measurements have been
generated with three different downsampling factors $f_d=[4,8,16]$ from the
high-resolution fields, and wall-parallel velocity fields have been
reconstructed at four inner-scaled wall-normal distances $y^+=[15,30,50,100]$.
We first show that SRGAN can be used to enhance the resolution of coarse wall
measurements. If compared with direct reconstruction from the sole coarse wall
measurements, SRGAN provides better instantaneous reconstructions, both in
terms of mean-squared error and spectral-fractional error. Even though lower
resolutions in the input wall data make it more challenging to achieve highly
accurate predictions, the proposed SRGAN-based network yields very good
reconstruction results. Furthermore, it is shown that even for the most
challenging cases the SRGAN is capable of capturing the large-scale structures
that populate the flow. The proposed novel methodology has great potential for
closed-loop control applications relying on non-intrusive sensing.

images in different polarization states, making it a rich source of information
for target characterization. PolSAR images are inherently affected by speckle.
Therefore, before deriving ad hoc products from the data, the polarimetric
covariance matrix needs to be estimated by reducing speckle. In recent years,
deep learning based despeckling methods have started to evolve from single
channel SAR images to PolSAR images. To this aim, deep learning based
approaches separate the real and imaginary components of the complex-valued
covariance matrix and use them as independent channels in a standard
convolutional neural networks. However, this approach neglects the mathematical
relationship that exists between the real and imaginary components, resulting
in sub-optimal output. Here, we propose a multi-stream complex-valued fully
convolutional network to reduce speckle and effectively estimate the PolSAR
covariance matrix. To evaluate the performance of CV-deSpeckNet, we used
Sentinel-1 dual polarimetric SAR images to compare against its real-valued
counterpart, that separates the real and imaginary parts of the complex
covariance matrix. CV-deSpeckNet was also compared against the state of the art
PolSAR despeckling methods. The results show CV-deSpeckNet was able to be
trained with a fewer number of samples, has a higher generalization capability
and resulted in a higher accuracy than its real-valued counterpart and
state-of-the-art PolSAR despeckling methods. These results showcase the
potential of complex-valued deep learning for PolSAR despeckling.

simulation models and data associated with a specific physical system. One of
the main reasons for developing a digital twin, is to enable the simulation of
possible consequences of a given action, without the need to interfere with the
physical system itself. Physical systems of interest, and the environments they
operate in, do not always behave deterministically. Moreover, information about
the system and its environment is typically incomplete or imperfect.
Probabilistic representations of systems and environments may therefore be
called for, especially to support decisions in application areas where actions
may have severe consequences.
  In this paper we introduce the probabilistic digital twin (PDT). We will
start by discussing how epistemic uncertainty can be treated using measure
theory, by modelling epistemic information via $\sigma$-algebras. Based on
this, we give a formal definition of how epistemic uncertainty can be updated
in a PDT. We then study the problem of optimal sequential decision making. That
is, we consider the case where the outcome of each decision may inform the
next. Within the PDT framework, we formulate this optimization problem. We
discuss how this problem may be solved (at least in theory) via the maximum
principle method or the dynamic programming principle. However, due to the
curse of dimensionality, these methods are often not tractable in practice. To
mend this, we propose a generic approximate solution using deep reinforcement
learning together with neural networks defined on sets. We illustrate the
method on a practical problem, considering optimal information gathering for
the estimation of a failure probability.

of the leading technologies employed in the next generations of wireless

efficiency, lower latency, and more reliability. Due to the massive number of
devices served by the base stations (BS) equipped with large antenna arrays,
massive-MIMO systems need to perform high-dimensional signal processing in a
considerably short amount of time. The computational complexity of such data
processing, while satisfying the energy and latency requirements, is beyond the
capabilities of the conventional widely-used digital electronics-based
computing, i.e., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and
Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). In this paper, the speed and
lossless propagation of light is exploited to introduce a photonic computing
approach that addresses the high computational complexity required by
massive-MIMO systems. The proposed computing approach is based on photonic
implementation of multiply and accumulate (MAC) operation achieved by
broadcast-and-weight (B&W) architecture. The B&W protocol is limited to real
and positive values to perform MAC operations. In this work, preprocessing
steps are developed to enable the proposed photonic computing architecture to
accept any arbitrary values as the input. This is a requirement for wireless
communication systems that typically deal with complex values. Numerical
analysis shows that the performance of the wireless communication system is not
degraded by the proposed photonic computing architecture, while it provides
significant improvements in time and energy efficiency for massive-MIMO systems
as compared to the most powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations in the compressible asymptotic
suction boundary layer (ASBL). The free-stream Mach number is assumed to be $<
0.8$ so that the flow is in the subsonic regime and we assume a perfect gas. We
extend the large-Reynolds number free-stream coherent structure theory of
\cite{deguchi_hall_2014a} for incompressible ASBL flow to describe a nonlinear
interaction in a thin layer situated just below the free-stream which produces
streaky disturbances to both the velocity and temperature fields, which can
grow exponentially towards the wall. We complete the description of the growth
of the velocity and thermal streaks throughout the flow by solving the
compressible boundary-region equations numerically. We show that the velocity
and thermal streaks obtain their maximum amplitude in the unperturbed boundary
layer. Increasing the free-stream Mach number enhances the thermal streaks,
whereas varying the Prandtl number changes the location of the maximum
amplitude of the thermal streak relative to the velocity streak. Such nonlinear
equilibrium states have been implicated in shear transition in incompressible
flows; therefore, our results indicate that a similar mechanism may also be
present in compressible flows.

networks like parallelism and analog state variables. Instead, they emulate
neural networks relying on binary computing, which results in unsustainable
energy consumption and comparatively low speed. Fully parallel and analogue
hardware promises to overcome these challenges, yet the impact of analogue
neuron noise and its propagation, i.e. accumulation, threatens rendering such
approaches inept. Here, we determine for the first time the propagation of
noise in deep neural networks comprising noisy nonlinear neurons in trained
fully connected layers. We study additive and multiplicative as well as
correlated and uncorrelated noise, and develop analytical methods that predict
the noise level in any layer of symmetric deep neural networks or deep neural
networks trained with back propagation. We find that noise accumulation is
generally bound, and adding additional network layers does not worsen the
signal to noise ratio beyond a limit. Most importantly, noise accumulation can
be suppressed entirely when neuron activation functions have a slope smaller
than unity. We therefore developed the framework for noise in fully connected
deep neural networks implemented in analog systems, and identify criteria
allowing engineers to design noise-resilient novel neural network hardware.

concentration are important in both engineering and natural systems. One of the
interesting natural examples is transpiration on plant leaves. Most of water in
the inner space of the leaves escapes through stomata, whose rate depends on
the surface topography and a difference in vapor concentrations inside and just
outside of the leaves. Previous research on the vapor flux on various surfaces
has focused on numerically solving the vapor diffusion equation or using
scaling arguments based on a simple solution with a flat surface. In this
present work, we present and discuss simple analytical solutions on various 2D
surface shapes (e.g., semicylinder, semi-ellipse, hair). The method of solving
the diffusion equation is to use the complex potential theory, which provides
analytical solutions for vapor concentration and flux. We find that a high mass
flux of vapor is formed near the top of the microstructures while a low mass
flux is developed near the stomata at the leaf surface. Such a low vapor flux
near the stomata may affect transpiration in two ways. First, condensed
droplets on the stomata will not grow due to a low mass flux of vapor, which
will not inhibit the gas exchange through the stomatal opening. Second, the low
mass flux from the atmosphere will facilitate the release of high concentrated
vapor from the substomatal space.

  characterize Tumor Field Effect: Application to Survival Prediction in
  Glioblastoma",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The concept of tumor field effect implies that cancer is a systemic disease
with its impact way beyond the visible tumor confines. For instance, in
Glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor, the increase in intracranial
pressure due to tumor burden often leads to brain herniation and poor outcomes.
Our work is based on the rationale that highly aggressive tumors tend to grow
uncontrollably, leading to pronounced biomechanical tissue deformations in the
normal parenchyma, which when combined with local morphological differences in
the tumor confines on MRI scans, will comprehensively capture tumor field
effect. Specifically, we present an integrated MRI-based descriptor,
radiomic-Deformation and Textural Heterogeneity (r-DepTH). This descriptor
comprises measurements of the subtle perturbations in tissue deformations
throughout the surrounding normal parenchyma due to mass effect. This involves
non-rigidly aligning the patients MRI scans to a healthy atlas via
diffeomorphic registration. The resulting inverse mapping is used to obtain the
deformation field magnitudes in the normal parenchyma. These measurements are
then combined with a 3D texture descriptor, Co-occurrence of Local Anisotropic
Gradient Orientations (COLLAGE), which captures the morphological heterogeneity
within the tumor confines, on MRI scans. R-DepTH, on N = 207 GBM cases
(training set (St) = 128, testing set (Sv) = 79), demonstrated improved
prognosis of overall survival by categorizing patients into low- (prolonged
survival) and high-risk (poor survival) groups (on St, p-value = 0.0000035, and
on Sv, p-value = 0.0024). R-DepTH descriptor may serve as a comprehensive
MRI-based prognostic marker of disease aggressiveness and survival in solid
tumors.

properties of the reciprocity feature in this model have not yet been studied.
We derive the asymptotic results on the number of reciprocal edges between two
fixed nodes, as well as the proportion of reciprocal edges in the entire PA

reciprocal edges in a directed PA network is close to 0, which differs from the

magnetic response due to the presence of a magnetization and geometric
confinement are analyzed within a tight-binding model. We observe a sizable
transverse susceptibility that can be considered as a gate voltage-induced
magnetoelectric torque without the need of a bias voltage, with different
directions for zigzag and armchair ribbons. The local torque generates
non-collinear spin polarization between the two edges and/or along the ribbon,
and the net torque averages to zero if the magnetization is homogeneous.
Nevertheless, a nonzero net torque can appear in partially magnetized
nanoribbons or in nanoflakes of irregular shapes. The equilibrium spin current
produced by the spin-orbit coupling also appears in nanoribbons, but the
component flowing in the direction of confinement is strongly suppressed. Even
without the magnetization, an out-of-plane polarized chiral edge spin current
is produced, resembling that in the quantum spin Hall effect. Moreover, a
magnetization pointing perpendicular to the edge produces a laminar flow of
edge charge currents, whose flow direction is symmetric (non chiral) or
antisymmetric (chiral) between the two edges depends on whether the
magnetization points in-plane or out-of-plane.

especially challenging in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). These are a kind of
mobile ad hoc networks made of e.g. (possibly, unmanned) vehicles and humans
where, despite a lack of continuous connectivity, data must be transmitted
while the network conditions change due to the nodes' mobility. In these
contexts, routing is NP-hard and is usually solved by heuristic ""store and
forward"" replication-based approaches, where multiple copies of the same
message are moved and stored across nodes in the hope that at least one will
reach its destination. Still, the existing routing protocols produce relatively
low delivery probabilities. Here, we genetically improve two routing protocols
widely adopted in DTNs, namely Epidemic and PRoPHET, in the attempt to optimize
their delivery probability. First, we dissect them into their fundamental
components, i.e., functionalities such as checking if a node can transfer data,
or sending messages to all connections. Then, we apply Genetic Improvement (GI)
to manipulate these components as terminal nodes of evolving trees. We apply
this methodology, in silico, to six test cases of urban networks made of
hundreds of nodes, and find that GI produces consistent gains in delivery
probability in four cases. We then verify if this improvement entails a
worsening of other relevant network metrics, such as latency and buffer time.
Finally, we compare the logics of the best evolved protocols with those of the
baseline protocols, and we discuss the generalizability of the results across
test cases.

forces due to other sources, impacts a range of biological functions: cell
adhesion, membrane fusion, self-assembly, binding-unbinding transition among
others. In this work, we take cognizance of the fact that biological membranes
are not purely mechanical entities and, due to the phenomenon of
flexoelectricity, exhibit a coupling between deformation and electric
polarization. The ensuing coupled mechanics-electrostatics-statistical
mechanics problem is analytically intractable. We use a variational
perturbation method to analyze, in closed-form, the contribution of
flexoelectricity to the entropic force between two fluctuating membranes and
discuss its possible physical implications. We find that flexoelectricity leads
to a correction that switches from an enhanced attraction at close membrane

the instantaneous field of view at a very high resolution in hundreds or
thousands of spectral channels. This enables objects to be detected and the
identification of materials that have subtle differences between them. However,
the increase in spectral resolution often means that there is a decrease in the
number of photons received in each channel, which means that the noise linked
to the image formation process is greater. This degradation limits the quality
of the extracted information and its potential applications. Thus, denoising is
a fundamental problem in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing. As images of
natural scenes with highly correlated spectral channels, HSIs are characterized
by a high level of self-similarity and can be well approximated by low-rank
representations. These characteristics underlie the state-of-the-art methods
used in HSI denoising. However, where there are rarely occurring pixel types,
the denoising performance of these methods is not optimal, and the subsequent
detection of these pixels may be compromised. To address these hurdles, in this
article, we introduce RhyDe (Robust hyperspectral Denoising), a powerful HSI
denoiser, which implements explicit low-rank representation, promotes
self-similarity, and, by using a form of collaborative sparsity, preserves rare

requires an initial gap of $\Omega(n)$. To corroborate our analytical results,
we use computer simulations to show that these consensus dynamics occur within

the thickness dependence of the cross-plane thermal conductivity is not known,
and the cross-plane phonon mean free paths in hBN have not been measured. We
measure the cross-plane thermal conductivity of hBN flakes exfoliated from bulk

increase in thermal conductivity with increasing thickness to contributions
from phonons with long mean free paths (MFPs), spanning many hundreds of
nanometers in the thickest flakes. When planar twist interfaces are introduced
into the crystal by mechanically stacking multiple thin flakes, the cross-plane
thermal conductivity of the stack is found to be a factor of seven below that

evidence that phonon scattering at twist boundaries limits the maximum phonon
MFPs. These results have important implications for hBN integration in
nanoelectronics and improve our understanding of thermal transport in

find that to match the EDGES signal, a warm dark matter particle must have a
mass of $7.3^{+1.6}_{-3.3}$ keV at 68\% confidence interval. This translates to
$2.2^{+1.4}_{-1.7} \times 10^{-20}$ eV for fuzzy dark matter and
$63^{+19}_{-35}$ keV for Dodelson-Widrow sterile neutrinos. Cold dark matter is
unable to reproduce the signal due to its slow structure growth.

The deep data are crucial to estimate the contribution of the different
galaxy's components, in particular the accreted fraction in the stellar halo.
The available integral-field observations with MUSE cover a limited portion of
each galaxy (out to $\sim 1R_e$), but, from the imaging analysis we find that
they map the kinematics and stellar population beyond the first transition
radius, where the contribution of the accreted component starts to dominate.
The main goal of this work is to correlate the scales of the different
components derived from the image analysis with the kinematics and stellar
population profiles from the MUSE data. Results were used to address the
assembly history of the three galaxies with the help of the theoretical
predictions. Our results suggest that PGC049940 has the lowest accreted mass
fraction of 77%. The higher accreted mass fraction estimated for PGC007748 and

major mergers, which have also shaped the shallower metallicity profiles

localization in measure spaces, which is based on what we call R\'enyi

this scheme to the four-dimensional unbounded phase space of the interacting

localization measures based on the Husimi function in the regime where the
model is chaotic, namely one that projects the Husimi function over the finite

that in unbounded spaces the definition of maximal delocalization requires a
bounded reference subspace, with different selections leading to contextual

integrate the orbit of MOs in a multi-component galaxy model via a
semi-analytical approach that accounts for dynamical friction generalized to
rotationally supported backgrounds. We compare the MO evolution in a galaxy
featuring a Milky Way-like rotating bar to the evolution within an analogous
axisymmetric galaxy without the bar. In agreement with previous studies, we
find that the bar presence may significantly affect the inspiral, sometimes
making it shorter by a factor of a few, sometimes hindering it for a Hubble
time. The erratic behaviour is mainly impacted by the relative phase at which
the MO encounters the stronger bar-induced resonances. In particular, the
effect of the bar is more prominent for initially in-plane, prograde MOs,
especially those crossing the bar co-rotation radius or outer Lindblad
resonance. In the barred galaxy, we find the sinking of the most massive MOs
(>~10^7.5 Msun) approaching the galaxy from large separations (>~8 kpc) to be
most efficiently hampered. Neglecting the effect of global torques associated
with the non-symmetric mass distribution is thus not advisable even within an
idealized, smooth galaxy model; we further note that spiral patterns are
unlikely to affect the inspiral due to their transient and fluctuating nature.
We speculate that the sinking efficiency of massive black holes involved in
minor galaxy mergers may be hampered in barred galaxies, making them less
likely to host a gravitational wave signal accessible to low-frequency
detectors.

consider a nonlinear lattice of an $\alpha$-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam type with the
additional feature of all-to-all harmonic long-range interactions whose
strength decays exponentially with distance. The competition between the
nonlinear nearest-neighbor terms and the longer-range linear ones yields two
parameter regimes where the dependence of the energy $H$ of the traveling waves
on their velocity $c$ is non-monotonic and multivalued, respectively. We
examine both cases, and identify the exact (up to a prescribed numerical
tolerance) traveling waves. To investigate the stability of the obtained
solutions, we compute their Floquet multipliers, thinking of the traveling wave
problem as a periodic one modulo shifts. We show that in the general case when
the relationship between $H$ and $c$ is not single-valued, the sufficient but
not necessary criterion for stability change is $H'(s)=0$, where $s$ is the
parameter along the energy-velocity curve. Perturbing the unstable solutions
along the corresponding eigenvectors, we identify two different scenarios of
the dynamics of their transition to stable branches. In the first one, the
perturbed wave slows down after expelling a dispersive wave. The second
scenario involves an increase in the velocity of the perturbed wave accompanied
by the formation of a slower small-amplitude traveling solitary wave.

computing due to its diverse applications in the various facets of a service
life cycle, such as service composition, service selection, service
recommendation. One of the primary objectives of designing a QoS prediction
algorithm is to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy. However, accuracy is
not the only criteria to meet while developing a QoS prediction algorithm. The
algorithm has to be faster in terms of prediction time so that it can be
integrated into a real-time recommendation or composition system. The other
important factor to consider while designing the prediction algorithm is
scalability to ensure that the prediction algorithm can tackle large-scale
datasets. The existing algorithms on QoS prediction often compromise on one
goal while ensuring the others. In this paper, we propose a semi-offline QoS
prediction model to achieve three important goals simultaneously: higher
accuracy, faster prediction time, scalability. Here, we aim to predict the QoS
value of service that varies across users. Our framework consists of
multi-phase prediction algorithms: preprocessing-phase prediction, online
prediction, and prediction using the pre-trained model. In the preprocessing
phase, we first apply multi-level clustering on the dataset to obtain
correlated users and services. We then preprocess the clusters using
collaborative filtering to remove the sparsity of the given QoS invocation log
matrix. Finally, we create a two-staged, semi-offline regression model using
neural networks to predict the QoS value of service to be invoked by a user in
real-time. Our experimental results on four publicly available WS-DREAM

interstellar medium and affect the stars' evolution. However, the winds are
inhomogeneous (clumped) and are difficult to model in radiative transfer codes.
To produce more realistic spectra many codes use a volume-filling factor
approach to incorporate the effects of clumping. While this approach is
convenient it is simplistic. We introduce an alternative approach to
incorporate clumping by assuming the wind is composed of dense spherical
shells. Using this approach in the radiative transfer code CMFGEN we produce
synthetic spectra for AzV83, an O7Iaf+ supergiant located in the Small
Magellanic Cloud. The spectrum of AzV83 is rich in both photospheric and wind
features, making it an ideal candidate with which to investigate the physical
characteristics of stellar winds. Synthetic spectra are compared to the star's
observed spectrum to better characterize the influence of clumped winds on
spectral features, and to better understand the limitations of the
volume-filling factor approach. The approach using spherical shells yields
similar wind parameters to those obtained using the volume-filling factor
approach although a slightly higher mass-loss rate is required to fit
H$\alpha$. As expected, the interclump medium in the model with shells allows
the high ionisation resonance transitions of N V and O VI to be fitted using
$L_{\rm X-ray}/L_{\rm Bol} \approx 10^{-7}$ which is typically observed for O
stars, and which is a factor of ten lower than needed with the volume-filling

our field-dependent IR reflectivity measurements. Additionally, we identify a
weak field-dependent shoulder near one of the CEF doublets. This indicates that
this level is split even in zero-field, which we associate with a vibronic
bound state. Modeling of the observed splitting shows that the phonon resides
at slightly lower energy compared to the CEF level that it couples to, which is
in contrast with previously published inelastic neutron measurements. The
magnetic field dependence of the vibronic state shows a gradual decoupling of
the phonon with the CEF level as it shifts. This approach should work in

general markets, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, we design an algorithm that
achieves a $O(\log^{1+\varepsilon}(T))$ regret to the agent-optimal stable
matching, with unknown time horizon $T$, improving upon the $O(\log^{2}(T))$
regret achieved in (Liu et al. 2020b). Second, we provide the optimal
$\Theta(\log(T))$ agent-optimal regret for markets satisfying uniqueness
consistency -- markets where leaving participants don't alter the original
stable matching. Previously, $\Theta(\log(T))$ regret was achievable
(Sankararaman et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2020b) in the much restricted serial
dictatorship setting, when all arms have the same preference over the agents.
We propose a phase-based algorithm, wherein each phase, besides deleting the
globally communicated dominated arms the agents locally delete arms with which
they collide often. This local deletion is pivotal in breaking deadlocks
arising from rank heterogeneity of agents across arms. We further demonstrate
the superiority of our algorithm over existing works through simulations.

and test distributions often suffer from poor generalization when faced with
unknown variations, such as a novel ethnicity or unpredictable individual
make-ups during test time. In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-domain
metric learning loss, which we dub Cross-Domain Triplet (CDT) loss, to improve
face recognition in unseen domains. The CDT loss encourages learning
semantically meaningful features by enforcing compact feature clusters of
identities from one domain, where the compactness is measured by underlying
similarity metrics that belong to another training domain with different
statistics. Intuitively, it discriminatively correlates explicit metrics
derived from one domain, with triplet samples from another domain in a unified
loss function to be minimized within a network, which leads to better alignment
of the training domains. The network parameters are further enforced to learn
generalized features under domain shift, in a model-agnostic learning pipeline.
Unlike the recent work of Meta Face Recognition, our method does not require
careful hard-pair sample mining and filtering strategy during training.
Extensive experiments on various face recognition benchmarks show the
superiority of our method in handling variations, compared to baseline and the

random string and generate a longer one, where the security of the protocol
does not rely on knowing the inner workings of the devices used to run it. In
order to do so, the protocol tests that the devices violate a Bell inequality
and one then needs to bound the amount of extractable randomness in terms of
the observed violation. The entropy accumulation theorem lower bounds the
extractable randomness of a protocol with many rounds in terms of the
single-round von Neumann entropy of any strategy achieving the observed score.
Tight bounds on the von Neumann entropy are known for the one-sided randomness
(i.e., where the randomness from only one party is used) when using the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game. Here we investigate the possible
improvement that could be gained using the two-sided randomness. We generate
upper bounds on this randomness by attempting to find the optimal eavesdropping
strategy, providing analytic formulae in two cases. We additionally compute
lower bounds that outperform previous ones and can be made arbitrarily tight
(at the expense of more computation time). These bounds get close to our upper
bounds, and hence we conjecture that our upper bounds are tight. We also
consider a modified protocol in which the input randomness is recycled. This
modified protocol shows the possibility of rate gains of several orders of
magnitude based on recent experimental parameters, making device-independent
randomness expansion significantly more practical. It also enables the locality
loophole to be closed while expanding randomness in a way that typical
spot-checking protocols do not.

quantized vortex arrays. At first sight, however, these effects for photons
seem vetoed: they do not interact with each other and they are immune to

guaranteed to perform at least as well as the randomized one. In particular,
for estimating any $L$ low-weight Pauli observables, a deterministic
measurement on only of order $\log(L)$ copies of a quantum state suffices. In
some cases, for example when some of the Pauli observables have a high weight,
the derandomized procedure is substantially better than the randomized one.

bandstructure within both ab initio and model Hamiltonian approaches. We show
that contrary to common assumption, the exciton bandstructure contains
non-analytical discontinuities -- a feature which is impossible to obtain from
the electronic bandstructure alone. These discontinuities are purely quantum

that the degree of these discontinuities depends on materials' symmetry and

MeV/nucleon impacts along the forward edge primarily from hydrogen and helium
nuclei. The accumulation of implanted slowly diffusing gas atoms in solids
drives damage through the meso-scale processes of bubble formation, blistering,
and exfoliation. This results in macroscopic changes to material properties
and, in the cases of blistering and exfoliation, material erosion via blister
rupture and delamination. Relativistic hydrogen and helium at constant velocity
will stop in the material at a similar depth, as predicted by Bethe-Bloch
stopping and subsequent simulations of the implantation distribution, leading
to a mixed hydrogen and helium system similar to that observed in fusion
plasma-facing components (PFC's). However, the difference in location of
near-surface gas atoms with respect to the direction of exposure means that
previously developed empirical models of blistering cannot be used to predict
bubble formation or blistering onset. In this work, we present a model of the
local gas concentration threshold for material blistering from exposure to the

sensing: fluorescence nanoscopy and optoplasmonic sensing. As the test system,
oligonucleotides with and without fluorescent labels are transiently hybridized
to complementary docking strands attached to gold nanorods. Comparing the
measured single-molecule kinetics helps to examine the influence of fluorescent
labels as well as factors arising from different sensing geometries. Our
results demonstrate that DNA dissociation is not significantly altered by the
fluorescent label, while DNA association is affected by geometric factors in
the two techniques. These findings open the door to exploiting plasmonic
sensing and fluorescence nanoscopy in a complementary fashion, which will aid
in building more powerful sensors and uncovering the intricate effects that
influence the behavior of single molecules.

every edge of a graph $G$ at least (resp. exactly) once. This notion was first
discussed by Leonhard Euler while solving the famous Seven Bridges of
K\""{o}nigsberg problem in 1736. What if Euler had to take a bus? In a temporal
graph $(G,\lambda)$, with $\lambda: E(G)\to 2^{[\tau]}$, an edge $e\in E(G)$ is
available only at the times specified by $\lambda(e)\subseteq [\tau]$, in the
same way the connections of the public transportation network of a city or of
sightseeing tours are available only at scheduled times. In this scenario, even
though several translations of Eulerian trails and walks are possible in
temporal terms, only a very particular variation has been exploited in the
literature, specifically for infinite dynamic networks (Orlin, 1984). In this
paper, we deal with temporal walks, local trails, and trails, respectively
referring to edge traversal with no constraints, constrained to not repeating
the same edge in a single timestamp, and constrained to never repeating the
same edge throughout the entire traversal. We show that, if the edges are
always available, then deciding whether $(G,\lambda)$ has a temporal walk or
trail is polynomial, while deciding whether it has a local trail is NP-complete
even if it has lifetime~2. In contrast, in the general case, solving any of
these problems is NP-complete, even under very strict hypothesis.

with real tunes, which limit point is the incoherent zero-amplitude frequency.
In other words, notwithstanding the RF bucket nonlinearity and potential well
distortion, the Landau damping is lost. Hence, even a tiny coupled-bunch
interaction makes the beam unstable; such growth rates for all the modes are
analytically obtained for arbitrary multipolarity. In practice, however, the
finite threshold of this loss of Landau damping is set either by the
high-frequency impedance roll-off or intrabeam scattering. Above the threshold,
growth of the leading collective mode should result in persistent nonlinear

among the most significant social and political movements in US history.
Abolitionist newspapers played a crucial role in spreading information and
shaping public opinion around a range of issues relating to the abolition of
slavery. These newspapers also serve as a primary source of information about
the movement for scholars today, resulting in powerful new accounts of the
movement and its leaders. This paper supplements recent qualitative work on the
role of women in abolition's vanguard, as well as the role of the Black press,
with a quantitative text modeling approach. Using diachronic word embeddings,
we identify which newspapers tended to lead lexical semantic innovations -- the
introduction of new usages of specific words -- and which newspapers tended to
follow. We then aggregate the evidence across hundreds of changes into a
weighted network with the newspapers as nodes; directed edge weights represent
the frequency with which each newspaper led the other in the adoption of a
lexical semantic change. Analysis of this network reveals pathways of lexical
semantic influence, distinguishing leaders from followers, as well as others
who stood apart from the semantic changes that swept through this period. More
specifically, we find that two newspapers edited by women -- THE PROVINCIAL
FREEMAN and THE LILY -- led a large number of semantic changes in our corpus,
lending additional credence to the argument that a multiracial coalition of
women led the abolitionist movement in terms of both thought and action. It
also contributes additional complexity to the scholarship that has sought to
tease apart the relation of the abolitionist movement to the women's suffrage
movement, and the vexed racial politics that characterized their relation.

fusion plasmas (as well as the respective nonlinear saturation mechanisms) are
known to be sensitive with respect to various physical parameters
characterizing the background plasma and the magnetic equilibrium. Therefore,
uncertainty quantification is essential for achieving predictive numerical
simulations of plasma turbulence. However, the high computational costs of the
required gyrokinetic simulations and the large number of parameters render
standard Monte Carlo techniques intractable. To address this problem, we
propose a multi-fidelity Monte Carlo approach in which we employ data-driven
low-fidelity models that exploit the structure of the underlying problem such
as low intrinsic dimension and anisotropic coupling of the stochastic inputs.
The low-fidelity models are efficiently constructed via sensitivity-driven
dimension-adaptive sparse grid interpolation using both the full set of
uncertain inputs and subsets comprising only selected, important parameters. We
illustrate the power of this method by applying it to two plasma turbulence
problems with up to $14$ stochastic parameters, demonstrating that it is up to
four orders of magnitude more efficient than standard Monte Carlo methods
measured in single-core performance, which translates into a runtime reduction
from around eight days to one hour on 240 cores on parallel machines.

  Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning","17 pages, 23 figures",,,,"physics.acc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning models of accelerator systems (`surrogate models') are able
to provide fast, accurate predictions of accelerator physics phenomena.
However, approaches to date typically do not include measured input
diagnostics, such as the initial beam distributions, which are critical for
accurately representing the beam evolution through the system. In addition,
these inputs often vary over time, and models that can account for these
changing conditions are needed. Simulations are in some cases needed to provide
sufficient training data. These typically represent the designed machine before
construction; however, the behavior of the installed components may be quite
different due to changes over time or static differences that were not modeled.
Therefore, surrogate models that can leverage both simulation and measured data
successfully are needed. We introduce an approach based on convolutional neural
networks that uses the drive laser distribution and scalar settings as inputs
for the Linac Coherent Light Source II injector frontend. The model is able to
predict scalar beam parameters and the transverse beam distribution downstream,
taking into account the impact of time-varying non-uniformities in the initial
transverse laser distribution. We also introduce and evaluate a transfer
learning procedure for adapting the surrogate model from the simulation domain
to the measurement domain, to account for differences between the two. Applying
this approach to our test case results in a model that can predict test sample
outputs within a mean absolute percent error of 7.6%. This is a substantial
improvement over the model trained only on simulations, which has an error of
112.7% when applied to measured data. While we focus on the LCLS-II Injector
frontend, these approaches for improving ML-based online modeling of injector
systems could be easily adapted to other accelerator facilities.

MR (PCMR). Methods: A residual U-net and our U-net M were used to generate the
high resolution x-f space estimate for k-t SENSE regularisation prior. The
networks were judged on their ability to generalise to real undersampled data.
The in-vivo validation was done on 20 real-time 18x prospectively undersmapled
GASperturbed PCMR data. The ML aided k-t SENSE reconstruction results were
compared against the free-breathing Cartesian retrospectively gated sequence
and the compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction of the same data. Results: In
general, the ML aided k-t SENSE generated flow curves that were visually
sharper than those produced using CS. In two exceptional cases, U-net M
predictions exhibited blurring which propagated to the extracted velocity
curves. However, there were no statistical differences in the measured peak
velocities and stroke volumes between the tested methods. The ML aided k-t
SENSE was estimated to be ~3.6x faster in processing than CS. Conclusion: The
ML aided k-t SENSE reconstruction enables artefact suppression on a par with CS
with no significant differences in quantitative measures. The timing results
suggest the on-line implementation could deliver a substantial increase in

further address another well-known challenge in rare event prediction, namely,
the class-imbalance issue. The SWAN-SF is an appropriate dataset for this, with
a 60:1 imbalance ratio for GOES M- and X-class flares and a 800:1 for X-class

challenges and present several experiments to illustrate the exact impact that
each of these remedies may have on performance. Moreover, we acknowledge that
some basic data manipulation tasks such as data normalization and cross
validation may also impact the performance -- we discuss these problems as
well. In this framework we also review the primary advantages and disadvantages
of using true skill statistic and Heidke skill score, as two widely used

we show and advocate for the benefits of time series vs. point-in-time

precise X-ray position and characteristic size agree with the published PSZ2
values, but yield a significant reduction in the scatter (by a factor of two)
in the $M_{500}^{\rm SZ}$-$M_{500}^{\rm X}$ relation. The slope is
$0.93\pm0.03$, and the median ratio, $M_{500}^{\rm SZ}/M_{500}^{\rm X}=
0.91\pm0.01$, is within the expectations from known X-ray calibration
systematics. The $Y_{\rm SZ}/Y_{\rm X}$ ratio is $0.88\pm0.02$, in good
agreement with predictions from cluster structure, and implying a low level of
clumpiness. In agreement with the findings of the Planck Collaboration, the
slope of the $Y_{\rm SZ}$-$D_{\rm A}^{-2} Y_{X}$ flux relation is significantly
less than unity ($0.89\pm0.01$). Using extensive simulations, we show that this
result is not due to selection effects, intrinsic scatter, or covariance
between quantities. We demonstrate analytically that changing the $Y_{\rm
SZ}$-$Y_{X}$ relation from apparent flux to intrinsic properties results in a
best-fit slope that is closer to unity and increases the dispersion about the

the best fit parameters of the $M_{500}^{\rm SZ}$-$M_{500}^{\rm X}$ relation
will be sample-dependent.

SAA theoretically and numerically. We analyze the bias of the new problems and
identify sufficient conditions for ensuring less biased estimation of the
optimal value of the true problem. At the same time, the error of the new
estimator remains controlled. We show that those conditions are satisfied for
many popular statistical problems such as regression models, classification
problems, and optimization problems with Average (Conditional) Value-at-Risk.
We have observed that smoothing the least-squares objective in a regression
problem by a normal kernel leads to a ridge regression. Our numerical
experience shows that the new estimators frequently exhibit also smaller

identified three distinct phases with increasing iodine coverage which we
tentatively associate with three phases previously reported in LEED experiments
(sqrt(3)x sqrt(3)R30, ""triangular"", ""hexagonal""). We used Fourier space and
real space analysis to fully characterize each phase. While Fourier analysis
most easily connects our measurements to previous LEED studies, the real space
inspection reveals local variations in the superstructures of the ""hexagonal""

stabilized by one or two adatoms sitting at the center of a rosette-like iodine
reconstruction. The most stunning discovery is that variation in the adatom
separation of the ""triangular"" phase reconstruct the Ag (111) surface lattice.

emerged as one of the most promising near term strategies for studying strongly
correlated quantum many-body systems. In particular, systems of interacting
photons, realizable in solid-state cavity and circuit QED frameworks, for
example, hold tremendous promise for the study of nonequilibrium many-body
phenomena due to the capability to locally create and destroy photons. These
systems are typically modeled using a Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard (JCH)
Hamiltonian, named due to similarities with the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model. Here,
we present a non-perturbative procedure for transforming the JC Hamiltonian
into a dressed operator representation that, in its most general form, admits
an infinite sum of bosonic $k$-body terms where $k$ is bound only by the number
of excitations in the system. We closely examine this result in both the
dispersive and resonant coupling regimes, finding rapid convergence in the
former and contributions from $k\gg1$ in the latter. Through extension to a
two-site JCH system, we demonstrate that this approach facilitates close
inspection of the analogy between the JCH and BH models and its breakdown for
resonant light-matter coupling. Finally, we use this framework to survey the
many-body character of a two-site JCH for general system parameters,
identifying four unique quantum phases and the parameter regimes in which they
are realized, thus highlighting phenomena realizable with finite JCH-based
quantum simulators beyond the BH model. More broadly, this work is intended to
serve as a clear mathematical exposition of bosonic many-body interactions
underlying JC-type systems, often postulated through analogy to Kerr-like
nonlinear susceptibilities or by matching coefficients to obtain the

$H=\frac{1}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2+\frac{1}{2}\phi^2(i\phi)^\varepsilon$ in

this earlier paper $E$ and $G_p(x_1,x_2,...,x_p)$ were expressed as

$\mu_0$ is a scaling factor having dimensions of mass. Expressions are given

(ii) General Convex and Non-Smooth objectives with access to a Noisy
Subgradient oracle. The crux of these algorithms is a polynomial complexity
source coding scheme that embeds a vector into a random subspace before
quantizing it. These embeddings are such that with high probability, their
projection along any of the canonical directions of the transform space is
small. As a consequence, quantizing these embeddings followed by an inverse
transform to the original space yields a source coding method with optimal
covering efficiency while utilizing just $R$-bits per dimension. Our algorithms
guarantee optimality for arbitrary values of the bit-budget $R$, which includes
both the sub-linear budget regime ($R < 1$), as well as the high-budget regime
($R \geq 1$), while requiring $O\left(n^2\right)$ multiplications, where $n$ is
the dimension. We also propose an efficient relaxation of this coding scheme
using Hadamard subspaces that requires a near-linear time, i.e., $O\left(n \log
n\right)$ additions.Furthermore, we show that the utility of our proposed
embeddings can be extended to significantly improve the performance of gradient
sparsification schemes. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical claims.

of the model architecture is often conflated with simultaneous changes to

strategies may matter more than architectural changes, and further, that the
resulting ResNets match recent state-of-the-art models. We show that the best
performing scaling strategy depends on the training regime and offer two new
scaling strategies: (1) scale model depth in regimes where overfitting can
occur (width scaling is preferable otherwise); (2) increase image resolution
more slowly than previously recommended (Tan & Le, 2019). Using improved
training and scaling strategies, we design a family of ResNet architectures,
ResNet-RS, which are 1.7x - 2.7x faster than EfficientNets on TPUs, while
achieving similar accuracies on ImageNet. In a large-scale semi-supervised
learning setup, ResNet-RS achieves 86.2% top-1 ImageNet accuracy, while being
4.7x faster than EfficientNet NoisyStudent. The training techniques improve
transfer performance on a suite of downstream tasks (rivaling state-of-the-art
self-supervised algorithms) and extend to video classification on Kinetics-400.
We recommend practitioners use these simple revised ResNets as baselines for
future research.

possible distortion of the panels, resulting in higher structural performance

individuals (e.g., a group of friends, a team, a corporation, etc.). Many of
these systems, however, either assume that (i) user preferences can be elicited
(or inferred) and then aggregated into group preferences or (ii) group
preferences are partially observed/elicited. We focus on making recommendations
for a new group of users whose preferences are unknown, but we are given the
decisions/choices of other groups. By formulating this problem as group
recommendation from group implicit feedback, we focus on two of its practical
instances: group decision prediction and reverse social choice. Given a set of
groups and their observed decisions, group decision prediction intends to
predict the decision of a new group of users, whereas reverse social choice
aims to infer the preferences of those users involved in observed group
decisions. These two problems are of interest to not only group recommendation,
but also to personal privacy when the users intend to conceal their personal
preferences but have participated in group decisions. To tackle these two
problems, we propose and study DeepGroup -- a deep learning approach for group
recommendation with group implicit data. We empirically assess the predictive
power of DeepGroup on various real-world datasets, group conditions (e.g.,
homophily or heterophily), and group decision (or voting) rules. Our extensive
experiments not only demonstrate the efficacy of DeepGroup, but also shed light
on the privacy-leakage concerns of some decision making processes.

that would trigger misclassification of DNNs but may be imperceptible to human
perception. Adversarial defense has been an important way to improve the
robustness of DNNs. Existing attack methods often construct adversarial
examples relying on some metrics like the $\ell_p$ distance to perturb samples.
However, these metrics can be insufficient to conduct adversarial attacks due
to their limited perturbations. In this paper, we propose a new internal
Wasserstein distance (IWD) to capture the semantic similarity of two samples,
and thus it helps to obtain larger perturbations than currently used metrics
such as the $\ell_p$ distance. We then apply the internal Wasserstein distance
to perform adversarial attack and defense. In particular, we develop a novel
attack method relying on IWD to calculate the similarities between an image and
its adversarial examples. In this way, we can generate diverse and semantically
similar adversarial examples that are more difficult to defend by existing
defense methods. Moreover, we devise a new defense method relying on IWD to
learn robust models against unseen adversarial examples. We provide both
thorough theoretical and empirical evidence to support our methods.

that the SNR expands into an hourglass-shape cavity and thus forms bipolar

naturally explained if the progenitor binary system had formed a dense CSM

throughout training? We approximate model training as a two stage process:
early on in training when the attention weights are uniform, the model learns
to translate individual input word `i` to `o` if they co-occur frequently.
Later, the model learns to attend to `i` while the correct output is $o$
because it knows `i` translates to `o`. To formalize, we define a model
property, Knowledge to Translate Individual Words (KTIW) (e.g. knowing that `i`
translates to `o`), and claim that it drives the learning of the attention.
This claim is supported by the fact that before the attention mechanism is
learned, KTIW can be learned from word co-occurrence statistics, but not the
other way around. Particularly, we can construct a training distribution that
makes KTIW hard to learn, the learning of the attention fails, and the model
cannot even learn the simple task of copying the input words to the output. Our
approximation explains why models sometimes attend to salient words, and
inspires a toy example where a multi-head attention model can overcome the
above hard training distribution by improving learning dynamics rather than
expressiveness. We end by discussing the limitation of our approximation
framework and suggest future directions.

of sight. The tangential column densities are then inverted to obtain the
atmospheric number density. The data from 219 occultation scans at low

analyzed to generate a single, highly-averaged (in both space and time)

measured density is about 50% smaller than the model. Such a deviation is
consistent with the recent measurement with the SABER aboard the TIMED

network, Alignment & Tracking & Pose Network (ATPN) for face alignment, face
tracking and head pose estimation. Specifically, to achieve better performance
with fewer layers for face alignment, we introduce a shortcut connection
between shallow-layer and deep-layer features. We find the shallow-layer
features are highly correspond to facial boundaries that can provide the
structural information of face and it is crucial for face alignment. Moreover,
we generate a cheap heatmap based on the face alignment result and fuse it with
features to improve the performance of the other two tasks. Based on the
heatmap, the network can utilize both geometric information of landmarks and
appearance information for head pose estimation. The heatmap also provides
attention clues for face tracking. The face tracking task also saves us the
face detection procedure for each frame, which also significantly boost the
real-time capability for video-based tasks. We experimentally validate ATPN on
four benchmark datasets, WFLW, 300VW, WIDER Face and 300W-LP. The experimental
results demonstrate that it achieves better performance with much less
parameters and lower computational complexity compared to other light models.

cycle of a structure, engineers are expected to accommodate for natural hazards
as well as operational load levels. Active control systems are an efficient
solution for structural response control when a structure is subjected to
unexpected extreme loads. However, development of these systems through
traditional means is limited by their model dependent nature. Recent
advancements in adaptive learning methods, in particular, reinforcement
learning (RL), for real-time decision making problems, along with rapid growth
in high-performance computational resources, help structural engineers to
transform the classic model-based active control problem to a purely
data-driven one. In this paper, we present a novel RL-based approach for
designing active controllers by introducing RL-Controller, a flexible and
scalable simulation environment. The RL-Controller includes attributes and
functionalities that are defined to model active structural control mechanisms
in detail. We show that the proposed framework is easily trainable for a five
story benchmark building with 65% reductions on average in inter story drifts
(ISD) when subjected to strong ground motions. In a comparative study with LQG
active control method, we demonstrate that the proposed model-free algorithm
learns more optimal actuator forcing strategies that yield higher performance,
e.g., 25% more ISD reductions on average with respect to LQG, without using
prior information about the mechanical properties of the system.

electrode spin-polarization, magnetization angle, and voltage, one is able to
switch between Poisson behavior, bunching and anti-bunching of electron

spin-valve is modeled by a single spin-degenerate molecular orbital with local
electronic repulsion coupled to two ferromagnetic leads with magnetization

systematic error for periodized ensembles compared to taking snapshots of
ensembles, we conduct computational experiments for microstructures with
circular, spherical and cylindrical inclusions and monitor the systematic
errors in the effective thermal conductivity for snapshots of ensembles
compared to working with microstructures sampled from periodized ensembles. We
observe that the standard deviation of the apparent properties computed on
microstructures sampled from the periodized ensembles decays at the scaling
expected from the central limit theorem. In contrast, the standard deviation
for the snapshot ensembles shows an inferior decay rate at high filler content.
The latter effect is caused by additional long-range correlations that
necessarily appear in particle-reinforced composites at high, industrially

noted that user powers have to be optimized to strike a balance between noise

based on the observation that adversarial examples are significantly less

large networks, we propose a novel defense framework, named attack as defense
(A2D), to detect adversarial examples by effectively evaluating an example's
robustness. A2D uses the cost of attacking an input for robustness evaluation
and identifies those less robust examples as adversarial since less robust
examples are easier to attack. Extensive experiment results on MNIST, CIFAR10
and ImageNet show that A2D is more effective than recent promising approaches.
We also evaluate our defence against potential adaptive attacks and show that

maintaining a desired performance across spatial and temporal domains. In this
paper, a graph-based framework, called SMART, is proposed to model and keep
track of the spatial and temporal statistics of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)
communication latency across a large geographical area. SMART first formulates
the spatio-temporal performance of a vehicular network as a graph in which each
vertex corresponds to a subregion consisting of a set of neighboring location
points with similar statistical features of V2I latency and each edge
represents the spatio-correlation between latency statistics of two connected
vertices. Motivated by the observation that the complete temporal and spatial
latency performance of a vehicular network can be reconstructed from a limited
number of vertices and edge relations, we develop a graph reconstruction-based
approach using a graph convolutional network integrated with a deep Q-networks
algorithm in order to capture the spatial and temporal statistic of feature map
pf latency performance for a large-scale vehicular network. Extensive
simulations have been conducted based on a five-month latency measurement study
on a commercial LTE network. Our results show that the proposed method can
significantly improve both the accuracy and efficiency for modeling and
reconstructing the latency performance of large vehicular networks.

deliberately constructed to misclassify victim models. As most adversarial
examples have restricted their perturbations to $L_{p}$-norm, existing defense
methods have focused on these types of perturbations and less attention has
been paid to unrestricted adversarial examples; which can create more realistic
attacks, able to deceive models without affecting human predictions. To address
this problem, the proposed adversarial attack generates an unrestricted
adversarial example with a limited number of parameters. The attack selects
three points on the input image and based on their locations transforms the
image into an adversarial example. By limiting the range of movement and
location of these three points and using a discriminatory network, the proposed
unrestricted adversarial example preserves the image appearance. Experimental
results show that the proposed adversarial examples obtain an average success
rate of 93.5% in terms of human evaluation on the MNIST and SVHN datasets. It
also reduces the model accuracy by an average of 73% on six datasets MNIST,
FMNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet. It should be noted that, in the
case of attacks, lower accuracy in the victim model denotes a more successful
attack. The adversarial train of the attack also improves model robustness

ensemble learning method to correct noisy labels by exploiting the local
structures of feature manifolds. Different from typical ensemble strategies
that increase the prediction diversity among sub-models via certain loss terms,
our method trains sub-models on disjoint subsets, each being a union of the
nearest-neighbors of randomly selected seed samples on the data manifold. As a
result, each sub-model can learn a coarse representation of the data manifold
along with a corresponding graph. Moreover, only a limited number of sub-models
will be affected by locally-concentrated noisy labels. The constructed graphs
are used to suggest a series of label correction candidates, and accordingly,
our method derives label correction results by voting down inconsistent
suggestions. Our experiments on real-world noisy label datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-arts.

poor compatibility with ferromagnets as sources of spin. While the broken

spin-charge interconversion, its control by electric fields is volatile.
Ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors stand as appealing materials unifying
semiconductivity, large spin-orbit coupling, and non-volatility endowed by
ferroelectricity. However, their potential for spintronics has been little
explored. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile, ferroelectric control of
spin-to-charge conversion at room temperature in epitaxial GeTe films. We show
that ferroelectric switching by electrical gating is possible in GeTe despite
its high carrier density. We reveal a spin-to-charge conversion as effective as
in Pt, but whose sign is controlled by the orientation of the ferroelectric
polarization. The comparison between theoretical and experimental data suggests
that spin Hall effect plays a major role for switchable conversion. These
results open a route towards devices combining spin-based logic and memory

fine-tuning. However, it is yet unknown which calibration method is the best
and how much performance improvement can be achieved. To address these issues,
we propose using composer information to construct labels for automatically
evaluating music similarity. Under this paradigm, we discover the optimal
combination of embedding calibration which achieves superior metrics than the
baseline methods.

$V$-module direct summand, $V$ is $C_2$-cofinite with a rigid tensor category
of modules, and $A$ has non-zero categorical dimension as a $V$-module. These

sensitive to inconsistencies in faces. We present an approach for high-quality
intuitive editing of the camera viewpoint and scene illumination in a portrait
image. This requires our method to capture and control the full reflectance
field of the person in the image. Most editing approaches rely on supervised
learning using training data captured with setups such as light and camera
stages. Such datasets are expensive to acquire, not readily available and do
not capture all the rich variations of in-the-wild portrait images. In
addition, most supervised approaches only focus on relighting, and do not allow
camera viewpoint editing. Thus, they only capture and control a subset of the
reflectance field. Recently, portrait editing has been demonstrated by
operating in the generative model space of StyleGAN. While such approaches do
not require direct supervision, there is a significant loss of quality when
compared to the supervised approaches. In this paper, we present a method which
learns from limited supervised training data. The training images only include
people in a fixed neutral expression with eyes closed, without much hair or
background variations. Each person is captured under 150 one-light-at-a-time
conditions and under 8 camera poses. Instead of training directly in the image
space, we design a supervised problem which learns transformations in the
latent space of StyleGAN. This combines the best of supervised learning and
generative adversarial modeling. We show that the StyleGAN prior allows for
generalisation to different expressions, hairstyles and backgrounds. This
produces high-quality photorealistic results for in-the-wild images and
significantly outperforms existing methods. Our approach can edit the
illumination and pose simultaneously, and runs at interactive rates.

While the combinatoric number of configurations can be huge even for mid-Z

much lower and depends strongly and non-trivially on temperature and density.
We discuss two useful methods for the estimation of the number of populated

around a concentric compound particle and investigate the deformation and
reorientation dynamics of the confining drop and its stability against breakup
in imposed linear flows. We obtain analytical expressions for the flow fields
upto O(Ca) (capillary number) and the deformed shape of the confining drop upto
O(Ca^2) using a domain perturbation technique. Further, we develop an O(Ca)
constitutive equation for the volume-averaged stress for a dilute dispersion of
compound particles. Compared to linear theory, O(Ca^2) calculations are found
to be important as they make qualitatively different predictions in some linear
flows. We find that the strong hydrodynamic interaction between the
encapsulated particle and the confining interface results in an increased
deformation of the confining drop compared to that of a simple drop, and
enhances the rheological quantities such as the effective shear viscosity,
extensional viscosity, and normal stress differences in a dilute dispersion.
These measures pertaining to particles, drops, and particles coated with a
fluid film are also derived as limiting cases of compound particles. Moreover,
linear viscoelastic behavior of a dilute dispersion of compound particles is
characterized in terms of complex modulus by subjecting the dispersion to a

from review sentences along with their corresponding opinion expressions and
sentiments, is an emerging task in fine-grained opinion mining. Since ASTE
consists of multiple subtasks, including opinion entity extraction, relation
detection, and sentiment classification, it is critical and challenging to
appropriately capture and utilize the associations among them. In this paper,
we transform ASTE task into a multi-turn machine reading comprehension (MTMRC)

non-restrictive extraction queries, restrictive extraction queries and
sentiment classification queries, to build the associations among different
subtasks. Furthermore, considering that an aspect sentiment triplet can derive
from either an aspect or an opinion expression, we design a bidirectional MRC
structure. One direction sequentially recognizes aspects, opinion expressions,
and sentiments to obtain triplets, while the other direction identifies opinion
expressions first, then aspects, and at last sentiments. By making the two
directions complement each other, our framework can identify triplets more
comprehensively. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate that BMRC achieves state-of-the-art performances.

between these different DGRs, and infer the ranking distribution of samples
from different levels in a DGR. Specifically, we develop two sub-networks to
learn the DGRs: a) Type Discrimination Network (TDN) that aims to embed DGR
into a compact code for better discriminating distortion types and learning the

provides efficiency and comprehensibility whereas robustness provides
resilience. Both topics have been studied in recent years but in isolation.
Here we present a robust model compression scheme which is independent of model
types: it can compress ensembles, neural networks and other types of models
into diverse types of small models. The main building block is the notion of
depth derived from robust statistics. Originally, depth was introduced as a
measure of the centrality of a point in a sample such that the median is the
deepest point. This concept was extended to classification functions which
makes it possible to define the depth of a hypothesis and the median
hypothesis. Algorithms have been suggested to approximate the median but they
have been limited to binary classification. In this study, we present a new
algorithm, the Multiclass Empirical Median Optimization (MEMO) algorithm that
finds a deep hypothesis in multi-class tasks, and prove its correctness. This
leads to our Compact Robust Estimated Median Belief Optimization (CREMBO)
algorithm for robust model compression. We demonstrate the success of this
algorithm empirically by compressing neural networks and random forests into
small decision trees, which are interpretable models, and show that they are
more accurate and robust than other comparable methods. In addition, our
empirical study shows that our method outperforms Knowledge Distillation on DNN

objectives of materials science. Unlike their three-dimensional counterparts,
2D materials can simultaneously demonstrate unique transport and mechanical
properties due to their dimensionality and quantum size effect. In their
fabrication and application, 2D materials are usually located on top of the
substrate or combined into heterostructures, which makes their structures and
properties strongly depend on the nature and quality of the environment. Here,
we present a novel method for studying the atomic structures of two-dimensional
materials and epitaxial thin films on arbitrary substrates. The method can
predict successful stages of epitaxial growth and the regions of stability of
each atomic configuration with experimental parameters of interest. We
demonstrate the performance of our methodology in the prediction of the atomic
structure of MoS2 on Al2O3 (0001) substrate. The method is also applied to
study the CVD growth of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride on Cu (111)
substrates. In both cases, stable monolayer and multilayer structures were
found. The stability of all the structures in terms of partial pressures of
precursors and temperature of growth is predicted within the ab initio

in demand for different minerals in recent years has led exploration geologists
to look for more efficient and innovative methods for processing different data
types at each stage of mineral exploration. As a primary step, various
features, such as lithological units, alteration types, structures, and
indicator minerals, are mapped to aid decision-making in targeting ore
deposits. Different types of remote sensing datasets, such as satellite and
airborne data, make it possible to overcome common problems associated with
mapping geological features. The rapid increase in the volume of remote sensing
data obtained from different platforms has encouraged scientists to develop
advanced, innovative, and robust data processing methodologies. Machine
learning methods can help process a wide range of remote sensing datasets and
determine the relationship between components such as the reflectance continuum
and features of interest. These methods are robust in processing spectral and
ground truth measurements against noise and uncertainties. In recent years,
many studies have been carried out by supplementing geological surveys with
remote sensing datasets, which is now prominent in geoscience research. This
paper provides a comprehensive review of the implementation and adaptation of
some popular and recently established machine learning methods for processing
different types of remote sensing data and investigates their applications for
detecting various ore deposit types. We demonstrate the high capability of
combining remote sensing data and machine learning methods for mapping
different geological features that are critical for providing potential maps.
Moreover, we find there is scope for advanced methods to process the new
generation of remote sensing data for creating improved mineral prospectivity
maps.

little can be concluded from the trial if the reference fails to be
efficacious. To overcome this, we investigate novel single-stage, adaptive test
strategies where non-inferiority is tested only if the reference shows
sufficient efficacy and otherwise $\delta$-superiority of the experimental

$\delta$-superiority indirectly shows non-inferiority. We optimize the sample

that under specific constraints on the sample sizes, this procedure controls

differs from the multipath routing techniques in many ways, e.g. M-BGP is only
implemented at border routers of Autonomous Systems (ASes); and while it shares
traffic to different IP addresses in a destination prefix via different border

In general, the operator $T$ and the powers $\alpha(k)$ are not known

infected individuals transmit the infection to the susceptible members of the
community through direct contact interactions. In the meantime, the
susceptibles gather information from the adjacent sites which may lead to
taking precautions. The SIR model is used for the diffusion of infection while
the Bass equation models the information diffusion. The sociological
classification of the individuals indicates that a small percentage of the
population take action immediately after being informed, while the majority
expect to see some real advantage of taking action. The individuals are assumed
to take two different precautions. The precursory measures are getting
vaccinated or trying to avoid direct contact with the neighbors. A weighted
average of states of the neighbors leads to the choice of action. The fully
connected and Scale-free Networks are employed as the underlying network of
interactions. The comparison between the simple contagion diffusion and the
diffusion of infection in a responsive society showed that a very limited
precaution makes a considerable difference in the speed and the size of the
spread of illness. Particularly highly connected hubs nodes play an essential
role in the reduction of the spread of disease.

averaging technique to the nonlinear rotating shallow water equations on the

consists of averaging the nonlinearity over phase shifts in the exponential of
the linear wave operator. Phase averaging aims to capture the slow dynamics in
a solution that is smoother in time (in transformed variables) so that larger
timesteps may be taken. We overcome the two key technical challenges that stand
in the way of studying the phase averaging and advancing its implementation: 1)
we have developed a stable matrix exponential specific to finite elements and
2) we have developed a parallel finite averaging proceedure. Following Peddle
et al (2019), we consider finite width phase averaging windows, since the
equations have a finite timescale separation. In our numerical implementation,
the averaging integral is replaced by a Riemann sum, where each term can be
evaluated in parallel. This creates an opportunity for parallelism in the
timestepping method, which we use here to compute our solutions. Here, we focus
on the stability and accuracy of the numerical solution. We confirm there is an
optimal averaging window, in agreement with theory. Critically, we observe that
the combined time discretisation and averaging error is much smaller than the
time discretisation error in a semi-implicit method applied to the same spatial
discretisation. An evaluation of the parallel aspects will follow in later

black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and in the presence of
such a dense environment ($\sim 10^{14}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$), they will form a new
kind of stellar population denoted as Accretion-Modified Stars (AMSs). This
hypothesis is supported by recent LIGO/Virgo detection of the mergers of very
high-mass stellar binary black holes (BHs). We show that the TZOs will be
trapped by the SMBH-disk within a typical AGN lifetime. In the context of
SMBH-disks, the rates of Bondi accretion onto BHs are $\sim 10^{9}L_{\rm
Edd}/c^{2}$, where $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$ is the
speed of light. Outflows developed from the hyper-Eddington accretion strongly
impact the Bondi sphere and induce episodic accretion. We show that the
hyper-Eddington accretion will be halted after an accretion interval of $t_{\rm
a}\sim 10^{5}m_{1}\,$s, where $m_{1}=m_{\bullet}/10\sunm$ is the BH mass. The
kinetic energy of the outflows accumulated during $t_{\rm a}$ is equivalent to
10 supernovae driving an explosion of the Bondi sphere and developing blast
waves. We demonstrate that a synchrotron flare from relativistic electrons
accelerated by the blast waves peaks in the soft X-ray band ($\sim 0.1\,$keV),
significantly contributing to the radio, optical, UV, and soft X-ray emission
of typical radio-quiet quasars. External inverse Compton scattering of the
electrons peaks around $40\,$GeV and is detectable through {\it Fermi}-LAT. The
flare, decaying with $t^{-6/5}$ with a few months, will appear as a slowly
varying transient. The flares, occurring at a rate of a few per year in
radio-quiet quasars, provide a new mechanism for explaining AGN variability.

under which the adoption of the spreading information blocks or suppresses the
epidemic spread. A two-layer network is the base of the model. The first layer
describes the direct contact interactions, while the second layer is the
information propagation layer. Both layers consist of the same nodes. The
society consists of five different categories of individuals: susceptibles,
infective, recovered, vaccinated and precautioned. Initially, only one infected
individual starts transmitting the infection. Direct contact interactions
spread the infection to the susceptibles. The information spreads through the
second layer. The SIR model is employed for the infection spread, while the
Bass equation models the adoption of information. The control parameters of the
competition between the spread of information and spread of disease are the
topology and the density of connectivity. The topology of the information layer
is a scale-free network with increasing density of edges. In the contact layer,
regular and scale-free networks with the same average degree per node are used
interchangeably. The observation is that increasing complexity of the contact
network reduces the role of individual awareness. If the contact layer consists
of networks with limited range connections, or the edges sparser than the
information network, spread of information plays a significant role in
controlling the epidemics.

second-order nonlinear material with an ultrashort coherent laser pulse
imprints the fluctuations of a terahertz field onto the resulting near-infrared
electrooptic signal. We describe how the statistics of this time-domain signal
can be calculated theoretically, incorporating from the onset the quantum
nature of the electric fields involved in the underlying interactions. To this
end, a microscopic quantum theory of the electro-optic process is developed
using an ensemble of non-interacting three-level systems as a model for the
nonlinear material. We find that the response of the nonlinear medium can be
separated into a classical part sampling the terahertz field and quantum
contributions independent of the state of the probed terahertz field. The
quantum response is caused by interactions between the three-level systems
mediated by the terahertz vacuum fluctuations. It arises due to cascading
processes and contributions described by quantum susceptibilities solely
accessible via quantum light. We show that the quantum contributions can be
substantial and might even dominate the total response. We also determine the
conditions under which the classical response serves as a good approximation of
the electro-optic process and demonstrate how the statistics of the sampled
terahertz field can be reconstructed from the statistics of the electro-optic
signal. In a complementary regime, electro-optic sampling can serve as a
spectroscopic tool to study the pure quantum susceptibilities of materials.

and a late-time accelerating epoch, and a nonsingular bouncing solution, the
latter being an asymptotic fixed point of the compactified phase space. The
infinity of the compactified phase space is interpreted as a region in which
the non-ideal behaviors of the previously mentioned cosmic fluids are
suppressed. Physical constraints on the adopted dimensionless variables are
derived by demanding the theory to be free from ghost and tachyonic
instabilities, and a novel cosmological interpretation of such variables is
proposed through a cosmographic analysis. The different effects of the equation
of state parameters on the number of equilibrium solutions and on their
stability nature are clarified. Some generic properties of these models, which
are not sensitive to the particular fluid considered, are identified, while
differences are critically examined by showing that the Redlich-Kwong scenario
admits a second radiation-dominated epoch and a Big Rip Singularity.

applications. It is a challenging problem as one needs to consider both
intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series correlations
simultaneously. Recently, there have been multiple works trying to capture both
correlations, but most, if not all of them only capture temporal correlations
in the time domain and resort to pre-defined priors as inter-series
relationships.
  In this paper, we propose Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) to
further improve the accuracy of multivariate time-series forecasting. StemGNN
captures inter-series correlations and temporal dependencies \textit{jointly}
in the \textit{spectral domain}. It combines Graph Fourier Transform (GFT)
which models inter-series correlations and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
which models temporal dependencies in an end-to-end framework. After passing
through GFT and DFT, the spectral representations hold clear patterns and can
be predicted effectively by convolution and sequential learning modules.
Moreover, StemGNN learns inter-series correlations automatically from the data
without using pre-defined priors. We conduct extensive experiments on ten
real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of StemGNN. Code is

whether these relationships could emerge from the assembly of large random

Lotka-Volterra model by introducing an area parameter that determines the
species richness of the assembled communities. Our analysis demonstrates that
the two most widely reported relationship forms can emerge due to differences
in immigration rates and skewness towards weak interactions. We particularly
highlight the incidence of the semi-log SAR for low immigration rates from a
source pool, which is consistent with several previous empirical studies. The
two SAR forms might show good fits to data over a large span of areas but a
power-law overestimates species richness on smaller islands in remote

derive the Einstein frame theory. We discuss the inflationary context of
$a$-attractors in order to specify the allowed range of values for the free

Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in the Einstein frame. Assuming a
piecewise polytropic equation of state, the lowest density part of which shall
be chosen to be the WFF1, or APR or the SLy EoS, we numerically solve the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations using a double shooting python-based

parameter $a$ characterizing the $a$-attractors. As we show, for large values
of $a$, which do not produce a viable inflationary era, the $M-R$ graphs are
nearly identical to the general relativistic result, and these two are
discriminated at large central densities values. Also, for large $a$-values,
the WFF1 equation of state is excluded, due to the GW170817 constraints. In
addition, the small $a$ cases produce larger masses and radii compared to the
general relativistic case and are compatible with the GW170817 constraints on
the radii of neutron stars. Our results indicate deep and not yet completely

559, 1994), whose shapes can be tuned distinctively: one has a variable barrier
height and the other has variable minima positions. However the two
parametrized double-well potentials reduce to the $\phi^4$ substrate, familiar
in the studies of structural phase transitions in centro-symmetric crystals or
bistable processes in biophysics. It is shown that although the parametric maps
are area preserving their routes to chaos display different characteristic
features: the first map exhibits a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations with
respect to the potential amplitude, but period-halving bifurcations with
respect to the shape deformability parameter. On the other hand the first
bifurcation of the second map always coincides with the first pitchfork
bifurcation of the $\phi^4$ map. However, an increase of the deformability
parameter shrinks the region between successive period-doubling bifurcations.
The two opposite bifurcation cascades characterizing the first map, and the
shrinkage of regions between successive bifurcation cascades which is
characteristic of the second map, suggest a non-universal character of the
Feigenbaum-number sequences associate with the two discrete parametric

more parameters to encode the orientation information, which are often highly
redundant and inefficient. Moreover, as ordinary CNNs do not explicitly model
the orientation variation, large amounts of rotation augmented data is needed
to train an accurate object detector. In this paper, we propose a

incorporate rotation-equivariant networks into the detector to extract
rotation-equivariant features, which can accurately predict the orientation and

demonstrate that these drawbacks both lead to less separable clusters in the

Based on these observations, we develop a simple baseline model for deep
multi-view clustering. Our baseline model avoids representation alignment
altogether, while performing similar to, or better than, the current state of

initiative. Therefore, the quality of the sensory traffic data is of paramount
importance. However, like any sensory data, urban traffic data are prone to
imperfections leading to missing measurements. In this paper, we focus on
inter-region traffic data completion. We model the inter-region traffic as a
spatiotemporal tensor that suffers from missing measurements. To recover the
missing data, we propose an enhanced CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) completion approach
that considers the urban and temporal aspects of the traffic. To derive the
urban characteristics, we divide the area of study into regions. Then, for each
region, we compute urban feature vectors inspired from biodiversity which are
used to compute the urban similarity matrix. To mine the temporal aspect, we
first conduct an entropy analysis to determine the most regular time-series.
Then, we conduct a joint Fourier and correlation analysis to compute its
periodicity and construct the temporal matrix. Both urban and temporal matrices
are fed into a modified CP-completion objective function. To solve this
objective, we propose an alternating least square approach that operates on the
vectorized version of the inputs. We conduct comprehensive comparative study
with two evaluation scenarios. In the first one, we simulate random missing
values. In the second scenario, we simulate missing values at a given area and
time duration. Our results demonstrate that our approach provides effective
recovering performance reaching 26% improvement compared to state-of-art CP
approaches and 35% compared to state-of-art generative model-based approaches.

transmit antennas are divided into groups to adopt TI-SM scheme in large-scale

(ICI) avoidance. This scheme is attractive due to both the high data rate and
good performance improvement that can be achieved. The bit error rate (BER)
performance of the TI-PSM scheme is evaluated and compared to that of the
conventional schemes. Simulation results demonstrated that a significant
improvement is achieved by the TI-PSM scheme as compared to the TI-SM and PSM
schemes for the same achieved rate. It is also shown that TI-SM and TI-PSM
schemes provide higher performance drop with channel estimation errors (CEEs)

  Machine Learning",,,,,"cs.CY cs.DB cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to make decisions in our
society. ML models, however, can be unfair to certain demographic groups (e.g.,
African Americans or females) according to various fairness metrics. Existing
techniques for producing fair ML models either are limited to the type of
fairness constraints they can handle (e.g., preprocessing) or require
nontrivial modifications to downstream ML training algorithms (e.g.,
in-processing).
  We propose a declarative system OmniFair for supporting group fairness in ML.
OmniFair features a declarative interface for users to specify desired group
fairness constraints and supports all commonly used group fairness notions,
including statistical parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity. OmniFair
is also model-agnostic in the sense that it does not require modifications to a
chosen ML algorithm. OmniFair also supports enforcing multiple user declared
fairness constraints simultaneously while most previous techniques cannot. The
algorithms in OmniFair maximize model accuracy while meeting the specified
fairness constraints, and their efficiency is optimized based on the
theoretically provable monotonicity property regarding the trade-off between
accuracy and fairness that is unique to our system.
  We conduct experiments on commonly used datasets that exhibit bias against
minority groups in the fairness literature. We show that OmniFair is more
versatile than existing algorithmic fairness approaches in terms of both
supported fairness constraints and downstream ML models. OmniFair reduces the
accuracy loss by up to $94.8\%$ compared with the second best method. OmniFair
also achieves similar running time to preprocessing methods, and is up to
$270\times$ faster than in-processing methods.

highly influential, it has come under increasing criticism following the
financial crisis of 2007/8. The quantum approach, in contrast, is inherently
probabilistic and dynamic. Decision-makers are described, not by a utility
function, but by a propensity function which specifies the probability of
transacting. We show how a number of cognitive phenomena such as preference
reversal and the disjunction effect can be modelled by using a simple quantum

propensity function can be quantized to incorporate effects such as
interference and entanglement that characterise human decision-making.

sample-level loss $G(S_t;M)$ at each learning step $t$, where $S_t$ is a subset
of $S$ (a.k.a. the mini-batch). Popular choices of $G$ include cross-entropy

behind this paradigm is that the mean value of the sample-level loss $G$, if

regime prior to the onset of synchronization. A properly trained machine will
possess the power to predict the synchronization transition in that, with a

models understand financial jargon or have labelled datasets concerning stock
price change. To overcome this challenge, we introduced FinALBERT, an ALBERT
based model trained to handle financial domain text classification tasks by
labelling Stocktwits text data based on stock price change. We collected
Stocktwits data for over ten years for 25 different companies, including the
major five FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). These datasets
were labelled with three labelling techniques based on stock price changes. Our
proposed model FinALBERT is fine-tuned with these labels to achieve optimal
results. We experimented with the labelled dataset by training it on
traditional machine learning, BERT, and FinBERT models, which helped us
understand how these labels behaved with different model architectures. Our
labelling method competitive advantage is that it can help analyse the
historical data effectively, and the mathematical function can be easily
customised to predict stock movement.

  in Video Games","Journal paper",,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  There has been a large body of research focused on the representation of
gender in video games. Disproportionately, there has been very little research
in respect to the representation of disability. This research was aimed at
examining the representation of disabled characters through a method of content
analysis of trailers combined with a survey of video gamers. The overall
results showed that disabled characters were under-represented in videogames
trailers, and respondents to the survey viewed disabled characters as the least
represented group. Both methods of research concluded that the representation
of disabled characters was low. Additionally, the characters represented were
predominantly secondary, non-playable characters not primary. However, the
research found that the defined character type was a mixture of protagonists
and antagonists, bucking the standard view of disabled characters in video
games.

  trials for COVID-19 using an epidemic simulation model",,,,,"q-bio.PE stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Clinical trials of a vaccine during an epidemic face particular challenges,
such as the pressure to identify an effective vaccine quickly to control the
epidemic, and the effect that time-space-varying infection incidence has on the
power of a trial. We illustrate how the operating characteristics of different
trial design elements may be evaluated using a network epidemic and trial
simulation model, based on COVID-19 and individually randomised two-arm trials
with a binary outcome. We show that ""ring"" recruitment strategies, prioritising
participants at high risk of infection, can result in substantial improvement
in terms of power, if sufficiently many contacts of observed cases are at high
risk. In addition, we introduce a novel method to make more efficient use of
the data from the earliest cases of infection observed in the trial, whose
infection may have been too early to be vaccine-preventable. Finally, we
compare several methods of response-adaptive randomisation, discussing their
advantages and disadvantages in this two-arm context and identifying particular
adaptation strategies that preserve power and estimation properties, while
slightly reducing the number of infections, given an effective vaccine.

(e.g., public health, education, economy, transportation, and the environment).
This novel pandemic and citywide implemented lockdown measures are affecting
virus transmission, people's travel patterns, and air quality. Many studies
have been conducted to predict the COVID-19 diffusion, assess the impacts of
the pandemic on human mobility and air quality, and assess the impacts of
lockdown measures on viral spread with a range of Machine Learning (ML)
techniques. This review study aims to analyze results from past research to
understand the interactions among the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures,
human mobility, and air quality. The critical review of prior studies indicates
that urban form, people's socioeconomic and physical conditions, social
cohesion, and social distancing measures significantly affect human mobility
and COVID-19 transmission. during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are
inclined to use private transportation for necessary travel purposes to
mitigate coronavirus-related health problems. This review study also noticed
that COVID-19 related lockdown measures significantly improve air quality by
reducing the concentration of air pollutants, which in turn improves the
COVID-19 situation by reducing respiratory-related sickness and deaths of
people. It is argued that ML is a powerful, effective, and robust analytic
paradigm to handle complex and wicked problems such as a global pandemic. This
study also discusses policy implications, which will be helpful for
policymakers to take prompt actions to moderate the severity of the pandemic
and improve urban environments by adopting data-driven analytic methods.

  using Minimal Simulator Runs","8 pages, 8 figures, Pre-Print. This work has been submitted to the
  IEEE for possible publication",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a truck filled with boxes of varying size and unknown mass and an
industrial robot with end-effectors that can unload multiple boxes from any
reachable location. In this work, we investigate how would the robot with the
help of a simulator, learn to maximize the number of boxes unloaded by each
action. Most high-fidelity robotic simulators like ours are time-consuming.
Therefore, we investigate the above learning problem with a focus on minimizing
the number of simulation runs required. The optimal decision-making problem
under this setting can be formulated as a multi-class classification problem.
However, to obtain the outcome of any action requires us to run the
time-consuming simulator, thereby restricting the amount of training data that
can be collected. Thus, we need a data-efficient approach to learn the
classifier and generalize it with a minimal amount of data. A high-fidelity
physics-based simulator is common in general for complex manipulation tasks
involving multi-body interactions. To this end, we train an optimal decision
tree as the classifier, and for each branch of the decision tree, we reason
about the confidence in the decision using a Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) framework to determine whether more simulator data will help reach a
certain confidence level. This provides us with a mechanism to evaluate when
simulation can be avoided for certain decisions, and when simulation will
improve the decision making. For the truck unloading problem, our experiments
show that a significant reduction in simulator runs can be achieved using the
proposed method as compared to naively running the simulator to collect data to
train equally performing decision trees.
