to friction using Lyapunov-based arguments. As the described system presents a
stick-slip phenomenon, the mass may then periodically sticks to the ground. The
objective consists of developing numerically tractable conditions ensuring the
global asymptotic stability of the unique equilibrium point. The proposed
approach merges two intermediate results: The first one relies on the
characterization of an attractor around the origin, to which converges the
closed-loop trajectories. The second result assesses the regional asymptotic
stability of the equilibrium point by estimating its basin of attraction. The
main result relies on conditions allowing to ensure that the attractor issued
from the first result is included in the basin of attraction of the origin
computed from the second result. An illustrative example draws the interest of
the approach.

distinct perspectives: either with knowledge-driven methods or more recently
with data-driven ones. On the one hand, we can explicitly implement
domain-knowledge or physical priors such as anticipating that vehicles will
follow the middle of the roads. While this perspective leads to feasible
outputs, it has limited performance due to the difficulty to hand-craft complex
interactions in urban environments. On the other hand, recent works use
data-driven approaches which can learn complex interactions from the data
leading to superior performance. However, generalization, \textit{i.e.}, having
accurate predictions on unseen data, is an issue leading to unrealistic
outputs. In this paper, we propose to learn a ""Realistic Residual Block"" (RRB),
which effectively connects these two perspectives. Our RRB takes any
off-the-shelf knowledge-driven model and finds the required residuals to add to
the knowledge-aware trajectory. Our proposed method outputs realistic
predictions by confining the residual range and taking into account its
uncertainty. We also constrain our output with Model Predictive Control (MPC)
to satisfy kinematic constraints. Using a publicly available dataset, we show
that our method outperforms previous works in terms of accuracy and
generalization to new scenes. We will release our code and data split here:

the amount of contaminated water or the number of inhabitants affected before

averaged over a set of contamination events, with contaminant injected at a
different location. Given a SP, propagation is simulated through a hydraulic
software model of the network to obtain spatio-temporal concentrations and the
average MDT. Searching for an optimal SP is NP-hard: even for mid-size
networks, efficient search methods are required, among which evolutionary
approaches are often used. A bi-objective formalization is proposed: minimizing
the average MDT and its standard deviation, that is the risk to detect some
contamination event too late than the average MDT. We propose a data structure
(sort of spatio-temporal heatmap) collecting simulation outcomes for every SP

in England were collected by Public Health England's Severe Acute Respiratory
Infections surveillance system and linked to death information. We applied
parametric multi-state mixture models, accounting for censored outcomes and
regressing risks and times between events on month of admission, geography, and
baseline characteristics.
  Findings: 20,785 adults were admitted with COVID-19 in 2020. Between March
and June/July/August estimated HFR reduced from 31.9% (95% confidence interval
30.3-33.5%) to 10.9% (9.4-12.7%), then rose steadily from 21.6% (18.4-25.5%) in
September to 25.7% (23.0-29.2%) in December, with steeper increases among older
patients, those with multi-morbidity and outside London/South of England. ICU
admission risk reduced from 13.9% (12.8-15.2%) in March to 6.2% (5.3-7.1%) in

  Interpretation: Initial improvements in patient outcomes, corresponding to
developments in clinical practice, were not sustained throughout 2020, with HFR
in December approaching the levels seen at the start of the pandemic, whilst
median hospital stays have lengthened. The role of increased transmission, new
variants, case-mix and hospital pressures in increasing COVID-19 severity

  Conference: VTC2021-Spring",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The problem of achieving ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC)
in multi-terminal networks has gained traction in the recent past owing to new
wireless applications in vehicular networks. In the context of multi-hop
networks, which is a classic example for multi-party communication, recent
studies have shown that automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) based decode-and-forward
(DF) strategies are suitable for URLLC since the idea of distributing a given
number of ARQs across the nodes provides fine control on the features of
reliability and latency. Inspired by these developments, in this work, we
propose a cooperative ARQ sharing strategy for URLLC in multi-hop networks. At
the heart of the proposed scheme lies the idea that every node is given the
knowledge of the number of ARQs allotted to its preceding node in addition to
the ARQs allotted to itself. As a result, each node only needs to count the
number of unsuccessful attempts of its preceding node, and then borrow the
unused ARQs, thereby improving the reliability feature with no compromise in
the latency constraint. Using packet-drop-probability (PDP) as the reliability

and Isomap have been extensively used. Recently, a neural network alternative
called autoencoder has been proposed and is often preferred for its higher
flexibility. This work aims to show that PCA is still a relevant technique for
dimensionality reduction in the context of classification. To this purpose, we
evaluated the performance of PCA compared to Isomap, a deep autoencoder, and a
variational autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three commonly used
image datasets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. The four different
dimensionality reduction techniques were separately employed on each dataset to
project data into a low-dimensional space. Then a k-NN classifier was trained
on each projection with a cross-validated random search over the number of
neighbours. Interestingly, our experiments revealed that k-NN achieved
comparable accuracy on PCA and both autoencoders' projections provided a big
enough dimension. However, PCA computation time was two orders of magnitude
faster than its neural network counterparts.

the same desired behavior at any of those scales, would greatly expand the
environments in which the robots could operate. However it is currently not
known whether such robots exist, and, if they do, how to design them. Since
self similar structures in nature often exhibit self similar behavior at
different scales, we hypothesize that there may exist robot designs that have
the same property. Here we demonstrate that this is indeed the case for some,
but not all, modular soft robots: there are robot designs that exhibit a
desired behavior at a small size scale, and if copies of that robot are
attached together to realize the same design at higher scales, those larger
robots exhibit similar behavior. We show how to find such designs in simulation
using an evolutionary algorithm. Further, when fractal attachment is not
assumed and attachment geometries must thus be evolved along with the design of
the base robot unit, scale invariant behavior is not achieved, demonstrating
that structural self similarity, when combined with appropriate designs, is a
useful path to realizing scale invariant robot behavior. We validate our
findings by demonstrating successful transferal of self similar structure and
behavior to pneumatically-controlled soft robots. Finally, we show that biobots
can spontaneously exhibit self similar attachment geometries, thereby
suggesting that self similar behavior via self similar structure may be
realizable across a wide range of robot platforms in future.

into two categories: model-based social constraints and learning-based

model-based approaches require constraint and parameter tuning to adapt to

Iterative Dimension Informed Program Synthesis (IDIPS) to address these

parameter optimization, predicate repair, and iterative human demonstration to

technique that can accommodate previously unseen social scenarios or
preferences by growing existing policies. We present experimental results
showing that IDIPS: 1) synthesizes effective policies that model user
preference, 2) can adapt existing policies to changing preferences, 3) can
extend policies to handle novel social scenarios such as locked doors, and 4)
generates policies that can be transferred from simulation to real-world robots

distinctions); (2) capture information on spatial distributions, such as
textures; (3) are cohesive and separable in latent space; and (4) are
rotationally invariant, (i.e., insensitive to the orientation of an image).
Results obtained when these evaluation protocols are applied to RICC outputs
suggest that the resultant novel cloud clusters capture meaningful aspects of
cloud physics, are appropriately spatially coherent, and are invariant to
orientations of input images. Our results support the possibility of using an
unsupervised data-driven approach for automated clustering and pattern

We then apply LipschitzNorm to GAT and Graph Transformers and show that their
performance is substantially improved in the deep setting (10 to 30 layers).
More specifically, we show that a deep GAT model with LipschitzNorm achieves

Recently, we studied thermal reverberation of a standard Novikov-Thorne

analytic prescription for the time lags as function of wavelength. In this
work, we use this analytic function to fit the time-lags spectra of seven
Seyferts, that have been intensively monitored, in many wave-bands, in the last
few years. We find that thermal reverberation can explain the observed
UV/optical time lags in all these sources. Contrary to previous claims, the
magnitude of the observed UV/optical time-lags is exactly as expected in the
case of a standard accretion disc in the lamp-post geometry, given the black
hole mass and the accretion rate estimates for the objects we study. We derive
estimates of the disc accretion rates and corona height for a non-spinning and
a maximally spinning black hole scenarios. We also find that the modelling of
the continuum optical/UV time-lags can be used to estimate the black hole spin,
when combined with additional information. We also find that the model
under-predicts the observed X-ray to UV time-lags, but this difference is
probably due to the broad X-ray auto-correlation function of these sources.

side of the shared resource, then, it is not possible to create perfect quantum
coherence remotely. Here, we present a method for the creation of quantum
coherence at a remote location via the use of entangled state and indefinite
causal order. We show this specifically for the superposition of two completely
depolarizing channels, two partially depolarizing channels and one completely
depolarizing channel along with a unitary operator. We find that when the
indefinite causal order of channels act on one-half of the entangled pair, then
the shared state looses entanglement, but can retain non-zero quantum discord.
This finding may have some interesting applications on its own where discord
can be consumed as a resource. Our results suggest that the indefinite causal
order along with a tiny amount of quantum discord can act as a resource in
creating non-zero quantum coherence in the absence of entanglement.

with $m \geq 2$ assets when the expected logarithmic growth (ELG) rate of
wealth is used as the performance metric. With the aid of the notion called
dominant asset, it is known that the optimal ELG level is achieved by investing
all available funds on that asset. However, such an ""all-in"" strategy is
arguably too risky to implement in practice. Motivated by this issue, we study
the case where the portfolio weights are chosen in a rather ad-hoc manner and a
buy-and-hold strategy is subsequently used. Then we show that, if the
underlying portfolio contains a dominant asset, buy and hold on that specific
asset is asymptotically log-optimal with a sublinear rate of convergence. This
result also extends to the scenario where a trader either does not have a
probabilistic model for the returns or does not trust a model obtained from
historical data. To be more specific, we show that if a market contains a
dominant asset, buy and hold a market portfolio involving nonzero weights for
each asset is asymptotically log-optimal. Additionally, this paper also
includes a conjecture regarding the property called high-frequency maximality.
That is, in the absence of transaction costs, high-frequency rebalancing is
unbeatable in the ELG sense. Support for the conjecture, involving a lemma for
a weak version of the conjecture, is provided. This conjecture, if true,
enables us to improve the log-optimality result obtained previously. Finally, a
result that indicates a way regarding an issue about when should one to
rebalance their portfolio if needed, is also provided. Examples, some involving

that businesses and other organizations take steps to reduce their exposure to

is the maximal share size relative to the secret size; and the
$\kappa$-complexity of a structure is the best lower bound provided by the
entropy method. A structure is $\kappa$-ideal if it has $\kappa$-complexity 1.
Motivated by the abundance of open problems in this area, the main results can
be summarized as follows. First, a new characterization of $\kappa$-ideal
multipartite access structures is given which offers a straightforward and
simple approach to specify ideal bipartite and tripartite structures. Second,
$\kappa$-complexity is determined for a range of bipartite access structures,

the rich properties of the endless library of naturally occurring molecules.
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) manifesting quantum strong confinement, possess
atomic like characteristics with s and p electronic levels, which popularized
the notion of CQDs as artificial atoms. Continuing this analogy, when two atoms
are close enough to form a molecule so that their orbitals start overlapping,
the orbitals' energies start to split into bonding and anti-bonding states made
out of hybridized orbitals. The same concept is also applicable for two fused
core-shell nanocrystals in close proximity. Their band-edge states, which
dictate the emitted photon energy, start to hybridize changing their electronic
and optical properties. Thus, an exciting direction of artificial molecules
emerges leading to a multitude of possibilities for creating a library of new
hybrid nanostructures with novel optoelectronic properties with relevance
towards diverse applications including quantum technologies. In a model fused
core-shell homodimer molecule, the hybridization energy is strongly correlated
with the extent of structural continuity, the delocalization of the exciton
wavefunction, and the barrier thickness as calculated numerically. The
hybridization impacts the emitted photon statistics manifesting a faster
radiative decay rate, photon bunching effect, and modified Auger recombination
pathway compared to the monomer artificial atoms. Future perspectives for the
nanocrystals chemistry paradigm are highlighted.

Clifford gates transversally it suffices to provide one additional non-Clifford
gate, such as the T-gate, to achieve universality. Common methods to implement
fault-tolerant T-gates like magic state distillation generate a significant
hardware overhead that will likely prevent their practical usage in the
near-term future. Recently methods have been developed to mitigate the effect
of noise in shallow quantum circuits that are not protected by error
correction. Error mitigation methods require no additional hardware resources
but suffer from a bad asymptotic scaling and apply only to a restricted class
of quantum algorithms. In this work, we combine both approaches and show how to
implement encoded Clifford+T circuits where Clifford gates are protected from
noise by error correction while errors introduced by noisy encoded T-gates are
mitigated using the quasi-probability method. As a result, Clifford+T circuits
with a number of T-gates inversely proportional to the physical noise rate can
be implemented on small error-corrected devices without magic state
distillation. We argue that such circuits can be out of reach for
state-of-the-art classical simulation algorithms.

Transparent checkpointing of Maya provides critically-needed fault tolerance,
since Maya is prone to crash when artists use some of its bleeding-edge

surveys the three main research tasks in embodied AI -- visual exploration,
visual navigation and embodied question answering (QA), covering the

mass-term deformations given by the effective (two open)-(one closed) couplings

closed string deformation. We show that this condition is always realized when
the worldsheet BCFT enjoys a global ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal symmetry and
the deforming closed string belongs to the chiral ring in both the holomorphic
and anti-holomorphic sector. In this case it is possible to explicitly evaluate
the mass deformation by localizing the SFT Feynman diagrams to the boundary of
world-sheet moduli space, reducing the amplitude to a simple open string
two-point function. As a non-trivial check of our construction we couple a
constant Kalb-Ramond closed string state to the OSFT on the
$\text{D}3$--$\text{D}(-1)$ system and we show that half of the bosonic

simultaneously. To account for this, we develop a model describing SHG in WGRs
with non-zero frequency detunings at both the pump and second-harmonic
frequencies. Our model predicts strong distortions of the line shape of pump
and second-harmonic resonances for similar linewidths at both frequencies; for
much larger linewidths at the second-harmonic frequency, this behavior is
absent. Furthermore, it describes the SHG efficiency as a function of detuning.
Experimentally, one can change the WGR eigenfrequencies, and thus the relative
detuning between pump and second-harmonic waves by a number of means, for
example electro-optically and thermally. Using a lithium niobate WGR, we show
an excellent quantitative agreement for the SHG efficiency between our
experimental results and the model. Also, we show the predicted distortions of
the pump and second-harmonic resonances to be absent in the lithium niobate
WGR, but present in a cadmium silicon phosphide WGR, as expected from the
linewidths of the resonances involved.

the edge reduces the overall communication latency of applications as workloads
can be processed closer to where data is generated on user devices rather than
sending them to geographically distant clouds. Specialised hardware
accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) available in the
cloud-edge network can enhance the performance of computationally intensive

approach required to facilitate this is virtualization of GPUs. This paper
therefore sets out to investigate the potential of GPU accelerator
virtualization to improve the performance of deep learning workloads in a
cloud-edge environment. The AVEC accelerator virtualization framework is
proposed that incurs minimum overheads and requires no source-code modification
of the workload. AVEC intercepts local calls to a GPU on a device and forwards
them to an edge resource seamlessly. The feasibility of AVEC is demonstrated on
a real-world application, namely OpenPose using the Caffe deep learning
library. It is observed that on a lab-based experimental test-bed AVEC delivers
up to 7.48x speedup despite communication overheads incurred due to data

improving AI algorithms to addressing the needs of the esports players such as

AI to be able to effectively address such needs in esports, AI agents require a

that end, in this position paper, we argue for human-in-the-loop approaches for
the discovery and computational embedding of the theory of mind within
behavioral models of esports players. We discuss that such approaches can be
enabled by player-centric investigations on situated cognition that will expand
our understanding of the cognitive and other unobservable factors that

heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces possible, while more and more
sophisticated handling of exchange and correlations within first principles
methods including density functional theory (DFT) supplemented with Hubbard U
corrections and hybrid functionals, and beyond DFT techniques like dynamical
mean field theory (DMFT) have made understanding of such correlated oxides and
oxide interfaces easier. The emergence of the high mobility two dimensional
electron gas with fascinating properties like giant photoconductance, large
negative magnetoresistance, superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and the
mysterious coexistence of the latter two have indeed caught the attention of
condensed matter community at large. Similarly strain tuning of oxides have
generated considerable interest particularly after the recent discovery of
piezoelectric methods of strain generation. Theoretical understanding and
prediction of the possible exotic phases emerging in such complex oxides both
under strain and in heterostructures will eventually lead to better design of
device applications in this new emerging field of oxide electronics, along with
possible discovery of exotic physics in condensed matter systems which may be
of wider significance! In this review we briefly look at theoretical studies of
novel phenomena in oxides under strain and oxide heterostructures, and try to
understand the role of exchange and particularly correlation in giving rise to
such exotic electronic states.

evaluate (or learn) policies in scenarios where the data are collected from a
distribution that substantially differs from that of the target policy to be
evaluated. Recent theoretical advances have shown that such sample-efficient
offline RL is indeed possible provided certain strong representational
conditions hold, else there are lower bounds exhibiting exponential error
amplification (in the problem horizon) unless the data collection distribution
has only a mild distribution shift relative to the target policy. This work
studies these issues from an empirical perspective to gauge how stable offline
RL methods are. In particular, our methodology explores these ideas when using
features from pre-trained neural networks, in the hope that these
representations are powerful enough to permit sample efficient offline RL.
Through extensive experiments on a range of tasks, we see that substantial
error amplification does occur even when using such pre-trained representations
(trained on the same task itself); we find offline RL is stable only under
extremely mild distribution shift. The implications of these results, both from
a theoretical and an empirical perspective, are that successful offline RL
(where we seek to go beyond the low distribution shift regime) requires
substantially stronger conditions beyond those which suffice for successful
supervised learning.

modern wireless communication systems, due to the proliferation of wireless
devices that interfere with each other. To cancel interference, digital
beamforming algorithms adaptively adjust the weight vector of the antenna
array, and in turn its radiation pattern, to minimize interference while
maximizing the desired signal power. While these algorithms are effective in
ideal scenarios, they are sensitive to signal corruptions. In this work, we
consider the case when the transmitter and receiver in a communication system
cannot be synchronized, resulting in a carrier frequency offset that corrupts
the signal. We present novel beamforming algorithms that are robust to signal
corruptions arising from this time-variant carrier frequency offset. In
particular, we bring in the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's) and
propose two atomic-norm-minimization (ANM)-based methods in both 1D and 2D
frameworks to design a weight vector that can be used to cancel interference
when there exist unknown time-varying frequency drift in the pilot and
interferer signals. Both algorithms do not assume a pilot signal is known.
Noting that solving ANM optimization problems via semi-definite programs can be
a computational burden, we also present a novel fast algorithm to approximately
solve our 1D ANM optimization problem. Finally, we confirm the benefits of our
proposed algorithms and show the advantages over existing approaches with a
series of experiments.

countermeasures is to disable or restrict JavaScript features deemed essential
for carrying out attacks. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, in this
work we seek to identify those JavaScript features which are essential for
carrying out a cache-based attack. We develop a sequence of attacks with
progressively decreasing dependency on JavaScript features, culminating in the
first browser-based side-channel attack which is constructed entirely from
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and HTML, and works even when script execution is
completely blocked. We then show that avoiding JavaScript features makes our
techniques architecturally agnostic, resulting in microarchitectural website
fingerprinting attacks that work across hardware platforms including Intel
Core, AMD Ryzen, Samsung Exynos, and Apple M1 architectures. As a final
contribution, we evaluate our techniques in hardened browser environments
including the Tor browser, Deter-Fox (Cao el al., CCS 2017), and Chrome Zero
(Schwartz et al., NDSS 2018). We confirm that none of these approaches
completely defend against our attacks. We further argue that the protections of
Chrome Zero need to be more comprehensively applied, and that the performance
and user experience of Chrome Zero will be severely degraded if this approach
is taken.

ALMA observations at 1.4 mm and 0.2'' (750au) angular resolution of
the Main core in the high-mass star forming region G31.41+0.31 have revealed a
puzzling scenario: on the one hand, the continuum emission looks very
homogeneous and the core appears to undergo solid-body rotation, suggesting a
monolithic core stabilized by the magnetic field; on the other hand, rotation
and infall speed up toward the core center, where two massive embedded
free-free continuum sources have been detected, pointing to an unstable core
having undergone fragmentation. Aims. To establish whether the Main core is
indeed monolithic or its homogeneous appearance is due to a combination of
large dust opacity and low angular resolution, we carried out millimeter
observations at higher angular resolution and different wavelengths. Methods.
We carried out ALMA observations at 1.4 mm and 3.5 mm that achieved angular
resolutions of 0.1''(375 au) and 0.075'' (280 au), respectively. VLA
observations at 7 mm and 1.3 cm at even higher angular resolution, 0.05'' (190
au) and 0.07'' (260 au), respectively, were also carried out to better study
the nature of the free-free continuum sources detected in the core. Results.
The millimeter continuum emission of the Main core has been clearly resolved
into at least four sources, A, B, C, and D, within 1'', indicating that the
core is not monolithic. The deconvolved radii of the dust emission of the
sources, estimated at 3.5 mm, are 400-500au, their masses range from 15 to 26
Msun, and their number densities are several 1E9 cm-3. Sources A and B, located
closer to the center of the core and separated by 750 au, are clearly
associated with two free-free continuum sources, likely thermal radio jets, and
are the brightest in the core. The spectral energy distribution of these two
sources and their masses and sizes are similar and suggest a common origin.

fine-grained information regarding each request is gathered by tracing both the

years. In this paper, we consider the $(\alpha,\beta)$-Thresholded Network
Dynamics ($(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics), where $\alpha\leq \beta$, in which only
structural dynamics (dynamics of the network) are allowed, guided by local
thresholding rules executed in each node. In particular, in each discrete round
$t$, each pair of nodes $u$ and $v$ that are allowed to communicate by the
scheduler, computes a value $\mathcal{E}(u,v)$ (the potential of the pair) as a
function of the local structure of the network at round $t$ around the two
nodes. If $\mathcal{E}(u,v) < \alpha$ then the link (if it exists) between $u$
and $v$ is removed; if $\alpha \leq \mathcal{E}(u,v) < \beta$ then an existing
link among $u$ and $v$ is maintained; if $\beta \leq \mathcal{E}(u,v)$ then a
link between $u$ and $v$ is established if not already present.
  The microscopic structure of $(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics appears to be simple,
so that we are able to rigorously argue about it, but still flexible, so that
we are able to design meaningful microscopic local rules that give rise to
interesting macroscopic behaviors. Our goals are the following: a) to
investigate the properties of the $(\alpha,\beta)$-Thresholded Network Dynamics
and b) to show that $(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics is expressive enough to solve
complex problems on networks.
  Our contribution in these directions is twofold. We rigorously exhibit the
claim about the expressiveness of $(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics, both by designing
a simple protocol that provably computes the $k$-core of the network as well as
by showing that $(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics is in fact Turing-Complete. Second
and most important, we construct general tools for proving stabilization that
work for a subclass of $(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics and prove speed of convergence
in a restricted setting.

machine learning. Each input or output is not an image or a sequence, but a
set: an unordered collection of multiple objects, each object described by a
feature vector. Their unordered nature makes them suitable for modeling a wide
variety of data, ranging from objects in images to point clouds to graphs. Deep
learning has recently shown great success on other types of structured data, so
we aim to build the necessary structures for sets into deep neural networks.
  The first focus of this thesis is the learning of better set representations
(sets as input). Existing approaches have bottlenecks that prevent them from
properly modeling relations between objects within the set. To address this
issue, we develop a variety of techniques for different scenarios and show that
alleviating the bottleneck leads to consistent improvements across many
experiments.
  The second focus of this thesis is the prediction of sets (sets as output).
Current approaches do not take the unordered nature of sets into account
properly. We determine that this results in a problem that causes discontinuity
issues with many set prediction tasks and prevents them from learning some
extremely simple datasets. To avoid this problem, we develop two models that
properly take the structure of sets into account. Various experiments show that
our set prediction techniques can significantly benefit over existing
approaches.

essential and challenging tasks to provide highly immersive virtual reality
(VR) experiences. It requires not only sophisticated deep neural network (DNN)
based codec avatar decoders to ensure high visual quality and precise motion
expression, but also efficient hardware accelerators to guarantee smooth
real-time rendering using lightweight edge devices, like untethered VR
headsets. Existing hardware accelerators, however, fail to deliver sufficient
performance and efficiency targeting such decoders which consist of
multi-branch DNNs and require demanding compute and memory resources. To
address these problems, we propose an automation framework, called F-CAD
(Facebook Codec avatar Accelerator Design), to explore and deliver optimized
hardware accelerators for codec avatar decoding. Novel technologies include 1)
a new accelerator architecture to efficiently handle multi-branch DNNs; 2) a
multi-branch dynamic design space to enable fine-grained architecture
configurations; and 3) an efficient architecture search for picking the
optimized hardware design based on both application-specific demands and
hardware resource constraints. To the best of our knowledge, F-CAD is the first
automation tool that supports the whole design flow of hardware acceleration of
codec avatar decoders, allowing joint optimization on decoder designs in
popular machine learning frameworks and corresponding customized accelerator
design with cycle-accurate evaluation. Results show that the accelerators
generated by F-CAD can deliver up to 122.1 frames per second (FPS) and 91.6%
hardware efficiency when running the latest codec avatar decoder. Compared to
the state-of-the-art designs, F-CAD achieves 4.0X and 2.8X higher throughput,
62.5% and 21.2% higher efficiency than DNNBuilder and HybridDNN by targeting

dissipation has motivated the development of thermoelectric concepts that
directly convert heat into electricity. The main challenge in practical
applications for thermoelectrics is the high cost from both materials and
manufacturing. Recently, breakthrough progresses in ionic thermoelectrics open
up new possibilities to charge energy storage devices when submitted to a
temperature gradient. The charging voltage is internally from the ionic Seebeck
effect of the electrolyte between two electrodes. Hence electrolytes with high
thermoelectric figure of merit are classified as ionic thermoelectric
materials. Most ionic thermoelectric materials are composed of abundant
elements, and they can generate hundreds of times larger thermal voltage than
that of electronic materials. This emerging thermoelectric category brings new
hope to fabricate low cost and large area heat-to-energy conversion devices,
and triggers a renewed interest for ionic thermodiffusion. In this review, we
summarize the state of the art in the new field of ionic thermoelectrics, from
the driving force of the ionic thermodiffusion to material and application
developments. We present a general map of ionic thermoelectric materials,
discuss the unique characters of each type of the reported electrolytes, and

orbital ordered state appears at lower temperatures. It is argued that the
origin of these orbital orders is related to the $T_h$ point group symmetry. As
for the fcc-fulleride model, the time-reversal broken orbital ordered state is

NP-hard problems when expressed in a QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization) or an Ising form. This is done by mapping a problem onto the
physical qubits and couplers of the quantum chip, from which a solution is read
after a process called quantum annealing. However, this process is subject to
multiple sources of biases, including poor calibration, leakage between
adjacent qubits, control biases, etc., which might negatively influence the
quality of the annealing results. In this work, we aim at mitigating the effect
of such biases for solving constrained optimization problems, by offering a
two-step method, and apply it to Graph Partitioning. In the first step, we
measure and reduce any biases that result from implementing the constraints of
the problem. In the second, we add the objective function to the resulting
bias-corrected implementation of the constraints, and send the problem to the
quantum annealer. We apply this concept to Graph Partitioning, an important
NP-hard problem, which asks to find a partition of the vertices of a graph that
is balanced (the constraint) and minimizes the cut size (the objective). We
first quantify the bias of the implementation of the constraint on the quantum
annealer, that is, we require, in an unbiased implementation, that any two
vertices have the same likelihood of being assigned to the same or to different
parts of the partition. We then propose an iterative method to correct any such
biases. We demonstrate that, after adding the objective, solving the resulting
bias-corrected Ising problem on the quantum annealer results in a higher
solution accuracy.

years. Here we introduce an approach that integrates atomistic molecular

The generated structural ensemble is then reweighted through the maximum
entropy principle so as to match reference SAXS experimental data at multiple

used at this reweighting stage. We apply this framework to the

the molecular hot core G34-MM1 at two different spatial scales. The dust

better angular resolution than previous observations, two perpendicular
molecular outflows arising from MM1-A. We suggest that subcores SC1 and SC2,
embedded in MM1-A, harbour the sources responsible of the main and the
secondary molecular outflow, respectively. Finally, from the radio continuum
emission at 334 GHz, we marginally detected another dust condensation, named
MM1-E, from which a young, massive, and energetic molecular outflow arises. The

admit a unique sharp type traveling wave for the degenerate case $m(p-1)>1$,
the so-called slow-diffusion case. This sharp traveling wave associated with
the minimal wave speed $c^*(m,p,r)$ is monotonically increasing, where the
minimal wave speed satisfies $c^*(m,p,r)<c^*(m,p,0)$ for any time delay $r>0$.
The sharp front is $C^1$-smooth for $\frac{1}{p-1}<m< \frac{p}{p-1}$, and
piecewise smooth for $m\ge \frac{p}{p-1}$. Our results indicate that time delay
slows down the minimal traveling wave speed for the doubly nonlinear degenerate

light-matter coupling and quantum geometry of Bloch wave functions, with a
particular focus on flat-band and moir\'e materials, in which the quenching of
the electronic kinetic energy could allow one to reach the limit of strong
light-matter coupling more easily than in highly dispersive systems. We show
that, despite the fact that flat bands have vanishing band velocities and
curvatures, light couples to them via geometric contributions. Specifically,
the intra-band quantum metric allows diamagnetic coupling inside a flat band;
the inter-band Berry connection governs dipole matrix elements between flat and
dispersive bands. We illustrate these effects in two representative model
systems: (i) a sawtooth quantum chain with a single flat band, and (ii) a
tight-binding model for twisted bilayer graphene. For (i) we highlight the
importance of quantum geometry by demonstrating a nonvanishing diamagnetic
light-matter coupling inside the flat band. For (ii) we explore the twist-angle
dependence of various light-matter coupling matrix elements. Furthermore, at
the magic angle corresponding to almost flat bands, we show a
Floquet-topological gap opening under irradiation with circularly polarized
light despite the nearly vanishing Fermi velocity. We discuss how these

that material in internal mean-motion resonances with a massive, coplanar

that it moves under gravity alone. If Fomalhaut b orbits close to the disc
midplane then its orbit crosses the disc, and the two are apsidally aligned.
This alignment may hint at an ongoing dynamical interaction. Using the
observationally allowed orbits, we then model the interaction between a massive
Fomalhaut b and debris. Whilst most debris is unstable in such an extreme
configuration, we identify several resonant populations that remain stable for
the stellar lifetime, despite crossing the orbit of Fomalhaut b. This debris

nonlinear vehicle model was approximated in a purely data-driven manner by a
linear predictor of higher order, namely the Koopman operator. The vehicle
system typically features a lot of nonlinearities such as rigid-body dynamics,
coordinate system transformations and most importantly the tire. These
nonlinearities are approximated in a predefined subset of the state-space by
the linear Koopman operator and used for a linear Model Predictive Control

dynamics evolve linearly. The result is a nonlinear MPC designed by linear
methodologies. It is demonstrated that the Koopman-based controller is able to
recover from a very unusual state of the vehicle where all the aforementioned
nonlinearities are dominant. The controller is compared with a controller based
on a classic local linearization and shortcomings of this approach are
discussed.

IP infringement risks. Given a target deep model, if the attacker knows its
full information, it can be easily stolen by fine-tuning. Even if only its
output is accessible, a surrogate model can be trained through student-teacher
learning by generating many input-output training pairs. Therefore, deep model
IP protection is important and necessary. However, it is still seriously
under-researched. In this work, we propose a new model watermarking framework
for protecting deep networks trained for low-level computer vision or image

the target model, which embeds a unified and invisible watermark into its
outputs. When the attacker trains one surrogate model by using the input-output
pairs of the barrier target model, the hidden watermark will be learned and
extracted afterwards. To enable watermarks from binary bits to high-resolution

training the target model and watermark embedding, the extra barrier can even
be absorbed into the target model. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework, which can resist attacks

vaccine rollout is state capacity. Here, we utilize two measures that quantify
different aspects of the state capacity: i) the external capacity (measured
through the soft power and the economic power of the country) and ii) the
internal capacity (measured via the country's government effectiveness) and
investigate their relationship with the coronavirus vaccination outcome in the
initial period (up to 30th January 2021). By using data on 189 countries and a

with the hypothesis that state capacity determines the observed heterogeneity

variability in 3D atmospheres induces changes in spectral-line parameters, some
of which are correlated. An adequate calibration could identify proxies for the

Recovery of spatially resolved line profiles with fitted widths and depths is
shown for various noise levels. Signals during exoplanet transit are simulated.

dust grains promotes fragmentation at small scales and the formation of
low-mass stars with $M_{*} \sim 0.01$--$0.1~M_{\odot}$ when $Z/Z_{\odot}

these cases, star formation begins after the turbulent motion decays and a
single massive cloud core monolithically collapses to form a central massive
stellar system. The circumstellar disk preferentially feeds the mass to the
central massive stars, making the mass distribution top-heavy. When
$Z/Z_{\odot}=0.1$, collisions of the turbulent flows promote the onset of the
star formation and a highly filamentary structure develops owing to efficient
fine-structure line cooling. In this case, the mass supply to the massive stars
is limited by the local gas reservoir and the mass is shared among the stars,
leading to a Chabrier-like IMF. We conclude that cooling at the scales of the

quantum chaos, and reveals correlations between real and imaginary parts of the
complex eigenvalues up to arbitrary energy (and time) scale. Specifically, we
provide the exact solution of DSFF for the GinUE and for a Poissonian random
spectrum (Poisson) as minimal models of dissipative quantum chaotic and
integrable systems respectively. For dissipative quantum chaotic systems, we
show that DSFF exhibits an exact rotational symmetry in its complex time
argument $\tau$. Analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) behaviour for GUE,
DSFF for GinUE shows a ``dip-ramp-plateau'' behavior in $|\tau|$: DSFF
initially decreases, increases at intermediate time scales, and saturates after
a generalized Heisenberg time which scales as the inverse mean level spacing.
Remarkably, for large matrix size, the ``ramp'' of DSFF for GinUE increases
quadratically in $|\tau|$, in contrast to the linear ramp in SFF for Hermitian
ensembles. For dissipative quantum integrable systems, we show that DSFF takes
a constant value except for a region in complex time whose size and behavior
depends on the eigenvalue density. Numerically, we verify the above claims and
show that DSFF for real and quaternion real Ginibre ensembles coincides with
the GinUE behaviour except for a region in complex time plane of measure zero
in the limit of large matrix size. As a physical example, we consider the
quantum kicked top model with dissipation, and show that it falls under the
Ginibre universality class and Poisson as the `kick' is switched on or off.
Lastly, we study spectral statistics of ensembles of random classical

calculation of the infinite tadpole of the (would-be) pseudoscalar neutral
scalar. We construct a simple toy model with the same flaws, where the
unrenormalizable infinity is easier to calculate. We then turn our attention to
the same tadpole in the real 2HDM. We spearhead this effort focusing on
diagrams involving solely bare quantities. This involves hundreds of Feynman
three-loop diagrams that could feed the CP violation from the quark into the
scalar sector, and is only possible with state of the art automatic computation
tools. Remarkably, some intermediate results agree when using three independent
derivations, including the peculiar cancellation of the leading pole divergence
due to a subtle interplay between masses and the Jarlskog invariant, which we
calculate analytically. The calculation is not complete however, since the full
two-loop renormalization of the real 2HDM is not yet available in the
literature. Still, we argue convincingly that there is an irremovable infinity.

  2021","10.3847/1538-4357/abeb6d",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamical friction is typically regarded a secular process, in which the
subject ('perturber') evolves very slowly (secular approximation), and has been
introduced to the host over a long time (adiabatic approximation). These
assumptions imply that dynamical friction arises from the LBK torque with
non-zero contribution only from pure resonance orbits. However, dynamical
friction is only of astrophysical interest if its timescale is shorter than the
age of the Universe. In this paper we therefore relax the adiabatic and secular
approximations. We first derive a generalized LBK torque, which reduces to the
LBK torque in the adiabatic limit, and show that it gives rise to transient
oscillations due to non-resonant orbits that slowly damp out, giving way to the
LBK torque. This is analogous to how a forced, damped oscillator undergoes
transients before settling to a steady state, except that here the damping is
due to phase mixing rather than dissipation. Next, we present a self-consistent
treatment, that properly accounts for time-dependence of the perturber
potential and circular frequency (memory effect), which we use to examine
orbital decay in a cored galaxy. We find that the memory effect results in a
phase of accelerated, super-Chandrasekhar friction before the perturber stalls
at a critical radius, $R_{\mathrm{crit}}$, in the core (core-stalling). Inside
of $R_{\mathrm{crit}}$ the torque flips sign, giving rise to dynamical
buoyancy, which counteracts friction and causes the perturber to stall. This
phenomenology is consistent with $N$-body simulations, but has thus far eluded
proper explanation.

stage for baryogenesis similar to the electroweak baryogenesis in the Standard
Model. A concrete realization utilizes the breaking of $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_X
\rightarrow U(1)_Y$. New chiral fermions charged under the extended gauge
symmetry have nonzero lepton numbers, which makes the $B-L$ symmetry anomalous.
The new lepton sector contains a large flavor-dependent CP violation, similar
to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa phase, without inducing sizable electric
dipole moments of the Standard Model particles. A bubble wall dynamics
associated with the first-order phase transition and $SU(2)_R$ sphaleron
processes generate a lepton asymmetry, which is transferred into a baryon
asymmetry via the ordinary electroweak sphaleron process. Unlike the Standard
Model electroweak baryogenesis, the new phase transition can be of the strong
first order and the new CP violation is not significantly suppressed by Yukawa
couplings, so that the observed asymmetry can be produced. The model can be
probed by collider searches for new particles and the observation of
gravitational waves. One of the new leptons becomes a dark matter candidate.
The model can be also embedded into a left-right symmetric theory to solve the
strong CP problem.

such an observation is only 0.00087. We also found a significant overabundance
of prolate rotators that are hosting multiple stellar shells. The visible tidal

Fermi surface state with the conventional Luttinger volume $1-p$ of electrons
for $p>p_c$, and a first order transition to a 'small' Fermi surface state with
a non-Luttinger volume $p$ of holes for $p<p_c$. As required by extended
Luttinger theorems, the small Fermi surface state also has fractionalized
spinon excitations. The model has electrons with strong local interactions in a
single band; after a canonical transformation, the interactions are transferred
to a coupling to two layers of ancilla qubits, as proposed by Zhang and Sachdev
(Phys. Rev. Research ${\bf 2}$, 023172 (2020)). Solvability is achieved by
employing random exchange interactions within the ancilla layers, and taking
the large $M$ limit with SU($M$) spin symmetry, as in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
models. The local electron spectral function of the small Fermi surface phase
displays a particle-hole asymmetric pseudogap, and maps onto the spectral
function of a lightly doped Kondo insulator of a Kondo-Heisenberg lattice
model. We discuss connections to the physics of the hole-doped cuprates: the
asymmetric pseudogap observed in STM, and the sudden change from incoherent to
coherent anti-nodal spectra observed recently in photoemission. A holographic

attractive interaction favors a $p+ip$ pairing symmetry. By analyzing its
topological properties, we identify such a chiral pairing state as a
higher-order topological superconductor, which depending on the existence of a
four-fold roto-inversion symmetry $\mathsf{R}_{4z}$, is either intrinsic
(meaning that the corresponding hinge states can only be removed by closing the
bulk gap, rather than modifying the surface states) or extrinsic. We achieve
this understanding via various methods recently developed for higher-order
topology, including Wannier representability, Wannier spectrum, and defect
classification approaches. For the $\mathsf{R}_{4z}$ symmetric case, we provide
a complete classification of the higher-order topological superconductors. We
show that such second-order topological superconductors exhibit chiral hinge
modes that are robust in the absence of interaction effects but can be
eliminated at the cost of introducing surface topological order.

multiplexing platform working with orbital angular momentum modes. In our
scheme, we maintain the practicability provided by the time-bin scheme, while
the quantum states are transmitted through a few-mode fiber in a configuration
that does not introduce post-selection losses. We experimentally demonstrate
our proposal by successfully transmitting phase-encoded single-photon states
for quantum cryptography over 500 m of few-mode fiber, showing the feasibility
of our scheme.

purpose of this paper is to illustrate the difference between fractional
Brownian motion (fBm) on the one hand and Gaussian Markov processes where H is
different to 1/2 on the other. The difference lies in the increments, which are
stationary and correlated in one case and nonstationary and uncorrelated in the
other. The two- and one-point densities of fBm are constructed explicitly. The
two-point density does not scale. The one-point density for a semi-infinite
time interval is identical to that for a scaling Gaussian Markov process with H
different to 1/2 over a finite time interval. We conclude that both Hurst
exponents and one-point densities are inadequate for deducing the underlying
dynamics from empirical data. We apply these conclusions in the end to make a
focused statement about nonlinear diffusion.

develop a framework for rotational (i.e. spin) quantum reference frames, with

give an explicit model for such frames as systems composed of three spin
coherent states of angular momentum $j$ and introduce the transformations
between them by upgrading the Euler angles occurring in classical
$\textrm{SO}(3)$ spin transformations to quantum mechanical operators acting on
the states of the reference frames. To ensure that an arbitrary rotation can be
applied on the spin we take the limit of infinitely large $j$, in which case
the angle operator possesses a continuous spectrum. We prove that rotationally
invariant Hamiltonians (such as that of the Heisenberg model) are invariant

the first development of the quantum reference frame formalism for a

discover each other. There are many different ND protocols, both in the
scientific literature and also those employed in practice. All ND protocols
involve devices sending beacons, and also listening for them. Protocols differ
in terms of how the beacon transmissions and reception windows are scheduled,
and the device sleeps in between consecutive transmissions and reception
windows in order to save energy. A successful discovery constitutes a sending
device's beacon overlapping with a receiving device's reception window. The
goal of all ND protocols is to minimize the discovery latency. In spite of the
ubiquity of ND protocols and active research on this topic for over two
decades, the basic question ""Given an energy budget, what is the minimum
guaranteed ND latency?"", however, still remains unanswered. Given the different
kinds of protocols that exist, there has also been no standard way of comparing
them and their performance. This paper, for the first time, answers the
question on the best-achievable ND latency for a given energy budget. We derive
discovery latencies for different scenarios, e.g., when both devices have the
same energy budgets, and both devices have different energy budgets. We also
show that some existing protocols can be parametrized such that they perform
optimally. The fact that the parametrizations of some other protocols were
optimal was not known before, and can now be established using our technique.
Our results are restricted to the case when a few devices discover each other
at a time, as is the case in most real-life scenarios. When many devices need
to discover each other simultaneously, packet collisions play a dominant role
in the discovery latency and how to analyze such scenarios need further study.

Quantum theory allows for a violation of these inequalities, which is famously

violation is, in general, an undecidable problem. Consequently, no algorithm
can be used to derive quantum analogs of Bell inequalities, which would
characterize the set of probability distributions allowed by quantum theory.
Here we present a family of inequalities, which approximate the set of quantum
correlations in Bell scenarios where the number of settings or outcomes can be
arbitrary. We derive these inequalities from the principle of Information
Causality, and thus, we do not assume the formalism of quantum mechanics.
Moreover, we identify a subspace in the correlation space for which the derived
inequalities give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the principle of

of Information Causality is strictly stronger than the principle of Macroscopic
Locality.

processes that influence formation. By characterizing the entire structure of
pearls (~3 mm) in cross-section at high resolution, we show nacre has
medium-range mesoscale periodicity. Self-correcting growth mechanisms actively
remedy disorder and topological defects of the tablets and act as a
countervailing process to long-range disorder. Nacre has a correlation length
of roughly 16 tablets (~5.5 um) despite persistent fluctuations and topological
defects. For longer distances (> 25 tablets, ~8.5 um), the frequency spectrum
of nacre tablets follows f^(-1.5) behavior suggesting growth is coupled to
external stochastic processes-a universality found across disparate natural
phenomena which now includes pearls.

global model of an environment from local observations of it; this is a
foundational capability for mobile robots, supporting such core functions as
planning, navigation, and control. This article reviews recent progress in
SLAM, focusing on advances in the expressive capacity of the environmental
models used in SLAM systems (representation) and the performance of the
algorithms used to estimate these models from data (inference). A prominent
theme of recent SLAM research is the pursuit of environmental representations
(including learned representations) that go beyond the classical attributes of
geometry and appearance to model properties such as hierarchical organization,
affordance, dynamics, and semantics; these advances equip autonomous agents
with a more comprehensive understanding of the world, enabling more versatile
and intelligent operation. A second major theme is a revitalized interest in
the mathematical properties of the SLAM estimation problem itself (including
its computational and information-theoretic performance limits); this work has
led to the development of novel classes of certifiable and robust inference
methods that dramatically improve the reliability of SLAM systems in real-world
operation. We survey these advances with an emphasis on their ramifications for
achieving robust, long-duration autonomy, and conclude with a discussion of
open challenges and a perspective on future research directions.

very different signal-to-noise ratios, it is necessary to consider coding
schemes that can be used in a multi-user environment but with different noise
immunity levels. Traditional detection systems based on the correlation
function and coding sequences have significant limitations in satisfying both
objectives, since the cross-correlation between coded signals corresponding
with different users is linked to the use of the same coded sequences length.
The research topic of binary sequences that have null cross-correlation and
different length has not been studied in depth, but it has potential
applications in multi-user environments. In this work an algorithm to generate
binary sequences completely uncorrelated with certain sets of complementary
sequences is presented. The proposed algorithm is based on nested Barker
sequences, and it is compared with a previous proposal based on an iterative
algorithm. This approach allows to generate more diversity of sequences of
different length than the iterative approach, which it makes useful for
applications based on binary sequences detection and expand the horizon of many

as the merging of two black holes at a distance of 1.3 billion light-years from
Earth, and the very small, such as the identification of individual viral
particles from a complex mixture. This dissertation is devoted to studying the
physical mechanisms that govern a tiny, yet highly versatile sensor: the
biological nanopore. Biological nanopores are protein molecules that form
nanometer-sized apertures in lipid membranes. When an individual molecule
passes through this aperture (i.e., ""translocates""), the temporary disturbance
of the ionic current caused by its passage reveals valuable information on its
identity and properties. Despite this seemingly straightforward sensing
principle, the complexity of the interactions between the nanopore and the
translocating molecule implies that it is often very challenging to
unambiguously link the changes in the ionic current with the precise physical
phenomena that cause them. It is here that the computational methods employed
in this dissertation have the potential to shine, as they are capable of
modeling nearly all aspects of the sensing process with near atomistic
precision.

with probabilistic adversarial training and regularization to synthesize a
student neural network controller with improved control robustness (measured by
a safe control rate metric with respect to adversarial attacks or measurement

computation time for verification). Experiments on three non-linear systems

needed to identify the number and direction of beams. The mobility of users
motivates the need for an online clustering scheme to maintain up-to-date beams
towards those clusters. Furthermore, mobility of users leads to varying
patterns of clusters (i.e., users move from the coverage of one beam to
another), causing dynamic traffic load per beam. As such, efficient radio
resource allocation and beam management is needed to address the dynamicity
that arises from mobility of users and their traffic. In this paper, we
consider the coexistence of Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC)
and enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) users in 5G mmWave networks and propose a
Quality-of-Service (QoS) aware clustering and resource allocation scheme.
Specifically, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
(DBSCAN) is used for online clustering of users and the selection of the number
of beams. In addition, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) scheme is used for resource block allocation. The performance of
the proposed scheme is compared to a baseline that uses K-means and
priority-based proportional fairness for clustering and resource allocation,
respectively. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms
the baseline algorithm in terms of latency, reliability, and rate of URLLC
users as well as rate of eMBB users.

rather than the exact distance. This models many situations of practical
importance, including NNS based on human similarity judgements, physical
measurements, or fast, randomized approximations to exact distances. A naive
approach to NNSU could employ any standard NNS algorithm and repeatedly query
and average results from the stochastic oracle (to reduce noise) whenever it
needs a pairwise distance. The problem is that a sufficient number of repeated
queries is unknown in advance; e.g., a point maybe distant from all but one
other point (crude distance estimates suffice) or it may be close to a large
number of other points (accurate estimates are necessary). This paper shows how
ideas from cover trees and multi-armed bandits can be leveraged to develop an
NNSU algorithm that has optimal dependence on the dataset size and the
(unknown)geometry of the dataset.

as machine learning, finance, insurance, energy, etc. When measuring very
extreme risk, the commonly used CVaR estimation method of sample averaging does
not work well due to limited data above the value-at-risk (VaR), the quantile
corresponding to the CVaR level. To mitigate this problem, the CVaR can be
estimated by extrapolating above a lower threshold than the VaR using a
generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), which is often referred to as the
peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach. This method often requires a very high
threshold to fit well, leading to high variance in estimation, and can induce
significant bias if the threshold is chosen too low. In this paper, we derive a
new expression for the GPD approximation error of the CVaR, a bias term induced
by the choice of threshold, as well as a bias correction method for the
estimated GPD parameters. This leads to the derivation of a new estimator for
the CVaR that we prove to be asymptotically unbiased. In a practical setting,
we show through experiments that our estimator provides a significant
performance improvement compared with competing CVaR estimators in finite
samples. As a consequence of our bias correction method, it is also shown that
a much lower threshold can be selected without introducing significant bias.
This allows a larger portion of data to be be used in CVaR estimation compared
with the typical POT approach, leading to more stable estimates. As secondary
results, a new estimator for a second-order parameter of heavy-tailed
distributions is derived, as well as a confidence interval for the CVaR which
enables quantifying the level of variability in our estimator.

increased inter-beam inter-cell interference, i.e. interference among beams

intensive research has been focused on finding suitable magnetic systems that

magnetization can be controlled through ultra-short single laser pulses. We
report here atomistic spin simulations of all-optical switching in multilayered
structures alternating n monolayers of Tb and m monolayers of Co. By using a
two temperature model, we numerically calculate the thermal variation of the
magnetization of each sublattice as well as the magnetization dynamics of
[Tbn/Com] multilayers upon incidence of a single laser pulse. In particular,
the condition to observe thermally-induced magnetization switching is
investigated upon varying systematically both the composition of the sample
(n,m) and the laser fluence. The samples with one monolayer of Tb as [Tb1/Co2]
and [Tb1/Co3] are showing thermally induced magnetization switching above a
fluence threshold. The reversal mechanism is mediated by the residual
magnetization of the Tb lattice while the Co is fully demagnetized in agreement
with the models developed for ferrimagnetic alloys. The switching is however
not fully deterministic but the error rate can be tuned by the damping
parameter. Increasing the number of monolayers the switching becomes completely
stochastic. The intermixing at the Tb/Co interfaces appears to be a promising
way to reduce the stochasticity. These results predict for the first time the
possibility of TIMS in [Tb/Co] multilayers and suggest the occurrence of
sub-picosecond magnetization reversal using single laser pulses.

shell located on a rotating null horizon is derived, when different interior
and exterior geometries are joined there. Although the induced metric on the
surface must be the same approached from either side, the first derivatives of
the metric need not be. Such discontinuities lead to a Dirac
$\delta$-distribution in the Einstein tensor localized on the horizon. For a
general stationary axisymmetric geometry the surface stress tensor can be
expressed in terms of two geometric invariants that characterize the surface,
namely the discontinuities $[\kappa]$ and $[\cal J]$ of the surface gravity
$\kappa$ and angular momentum density $\cal J$. The Komar energy and angular
momentum are given in coordinates adapted to the Killing symmetries, and the
surface contributions to each determined in terms of $[\kappa]$ and $[\cal J]$.
Guided by these, a simple modification of the original Israel junction
conditions is verified directly from the Einstein tensor density to give the
correct finite result for the surface stress, when the normal $\boldsymbol n$
to the surface is allowed to tend continuously to a null vector. The relation
to Israel's original junction conditions, which fail on null surfaces, is
given. The modified junction conditions are suitable to the matching of a

hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE), particularly
with regards to how it differs from that in dark matter only (DMO) simulations.
We find that, in general, DMO simulations produce halo mass functions (HMF)
that are shifted to higher halo masses than their hydrodynamic counterparts,
due to the lack of baryonic physics. However, the exact nature of this mass
shift is a complex function of mass, halo definition, redshift, and
larger-scale environment, and it also depends on the specifics of the baryonic
physics implemented in the simulation. We present fitting formulae for the
corrections one would need to apply to each DMO halo catalogue in order to
reproduce the HMF found in its hydrodynamic counterpart. We provide these
formulae for all three simulations, for five different halo definitions at
redshifts 0, 1, and 2. Additionally, we explore the dependence on environment
of this HMF discrepancy, and find that, in most cases, halos in low density
environments are slightly more impacted by baryonic physics than halos in high
density environments. We thus also provide environment-dependent mass
correction formulae that can reproduce the conditional, as well as global, HMF.
We show that our mass corrections also repair the large-scale clustering of
halos, though the environment-dependent corrections are required to achieve an
accuracy better than 2%. Finally, we examine the impact of baryonic physics on
the halo mass - concentration relation, and find that its slope in hydrodynamic
simulations is consistent with that in DMO simulations. Ultimately, we
recommend that any future work relying on DMO halo catalogues incorporate our
mass corrections to test the robustness of their results to baryonic effects.

of view. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm - called Disentangling
Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (DisentanGAIL) - with the purpose of
bypassing such constraints. Our algorithm enables autonomous agents to learn
directly from high dimensional observations of an expert performing a task, by
making use of adversarial learning with a latent representation inside the
discriminator network. Such latent representation is regularized through mutual
information constraints to incentivize learning only features that encode
information about the completion levels of the task being demonstrated. This
allows to obtain a shared feature space to successfully perform imitation while
disregarding the differences between the expert's and the agent's domains.
Empirically, our algorithm is able to efficiently imitate in a diverse range of
control problems including balancing, manipulation and locomotive tasks, while
being robust to various domain differences in terms of both environment

the Global spectrum between ~10-110 MHz because of the ubiquity of neutral

required to detect this weak, isotropic emission of hydrogen amidst the bright
foreground Galactic radiation. We describe how two antennas will permit

the scene through a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point cloud and use 2D-3D
matches between a query image and the 3D points for camera pose estimation. As
recently shown, image details can be accurately recovered from SfM point clouds
by translating renderings of the sparse point clouds to images. To address the
resulting potential privacy risks for user-generated content, it was recently
proposed to lift point clouds to line clouds by replacing 3D points by randomly
oriented 3D lines passing through these points. The resulting representation is
unintelligible to humans and effectively prevents point cloud-to-image
translation. This paper shows that a significant amount of information about
the 3D scene geometry is preserved in these line clouds, allowing us to

transverse conductivity assumes a universal value in the quasi-static ($\omega
\rightarrow 0$) limit for wavevectors $q$ in the regime $l_{\rm mfp}^{-1} \ll q
\ll p_{\rm F}$, where $l_{\rm mfp}$ is the mean free path and $p_{\rm F}$ is
the Fermi momentum. This value is $(e^2/h) \mathcal{R}_{\rm FS}/q$ in two
dimensions (2D), where $\mathcal{R}_{\rm FS}$ measures the local radius of
curvature of the Fermi surface in momentum space. Even more surprisingly, we
find that U(1) spin liquids with a spinon Fermi surface have the same universal
transverse conductivity. This means such spin liquids behave effectively as
metals in this regime, even though they appear insulating in standard transport
experiments. Moreover, we show that transverse current fluctuations result in a
universal low-frequency magnetic noise that can be directly probed by a spin
qubit, such as a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, placed at a distance $z$
above of the 2D metal or spin liquid. Specifically the magnetic noise is given
by $C\omega \mathcal{P}_{\rm FS}/z$, where $\mathcal{P}_{\rm FS}$ is the
perimeter of the Fermi surface in momentum space and $C$ is a combination of
fundamental constants of nature. Therefore these observables are controlled
purely by the geometry of the Fermi surface and are independent of kinematic
details of the quasi-particles, such as their effective mass and interactions.
This behavior can be used as a new technique to measure the size of the Fermi
surface of metals and as a smoking gun probe to pinpoint the presence of the
elusive spinon Fermi surface in two-dimensional systems. We estimate that this
universal regime is within reach of current nitrogen-vacancy center
spectroscopic techniques for several spinon Fermi surface candidate materials.

that is controlled by a linear feedback force. Specifically, we are interested
in sampling the possibly multimodal invariant probability distribution of a
Langevin system at small noise (or low temperature), for which the dynamics can
easily get trapped inside metastable subsets of the phase space. We follow
[Chen et al., J. Math. Phys. 56, 113302, 2015] and consider a Langevin equation
that is simulated at a high temperature, with the control playing the role of a
friction that balances the additional noise so as to restore the original
invariant measure at a lower temperature. We discuss different limits as the
temperature ratio goes to infinity and prove convergence to a limit dynamics.
It turns out that, depending on whether the lower (""target"") or the higher
(""simulation"") temperature is fixed, the controlled dynamics converges either
to the overdamped Langevin equation or to a deterministic gradient flow. This
implies that (a) the ergodic limit and the large temperature separation limit
do not commute in general, and that (b) it is not possible to accelerate the
speed of convergence to the ergodic limit by making the temperature separation
larger and larger. We discuss the implications of these observation from the
perspective of stochastic optimisation algorithms and enhanced sampling schemes
in molecular dynamics.

physiological function rather than structural disturbances by measuring
cerebral perfusion or glucose consumption. However, this imaging technique
relies on injection of radioactive tracers and is expensive. On the contrary,
Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI is a non-invasive, non-radioactive, and
relatively cheap imaging technique for brain hemodynamic measurements, which
allows quantification to some extent. In this paper we propose a convolutional
neural network (CNN) based model for translating ASL to PET images, which could
benefit patients as well as the healthcare system in terms of expenses and
adverse side effects. However, acquiring a sufficient number of paired ASL-PET
scans for training a CNN is prohibitive for many reasons. To tackle this
problem, we present a new semi-supervised multitask CNN which is trained on
both paired data, i.e. ASL and PET scans, and unpaired data, i.e. only ASL
scans, which alleviates the problem of training a network on limited paired
data. Moreover, we present a new residual-based-attention guided mechanism to
improve the contextual features during the training process. Also, we show that
incorporating T1-weighted scans as an input, due to its high resolution and
availability of anatomical information, improves the results. We performed a
two-stage evaluation based on quantitative image metrics by conducting a 7-fold
cross validation followed by a double-blind observer study. The proposed
network achieved structural similarity index measure (SSIM), mean squared error

four clumps arose from four source bodies in a co-orbital configuration. We
find that there are no solutions with four masses that produce the observed
spacings. We therefore consider whether an unseen fifth co-orbital object could
account for the discrepancies in the angular separations and approach a stable
stationary configuration. We find a range of solutions for five co-orbital
objects where their mass ratios depend on the assumed location of the fifth
mass. Numerical simulations of five co-orbitals are highly sensitive to initial
conditions, especially for the range of masses we would expect the D68 clumps

cross-entropy were used as the cost function. Our primary goal was to verify,
whether such design would result in a descent general purpose classifier, with
performance comparable to off the shelf classical methods. As the preliminary
results were promising, we investigated the hypothesis that the performance of
$d$-step classifier can be attributed to a fact that in previous $d-1$ steps it
transforms the feature space by grouping observations belonging to a given

hypothesis we calculated three clustering scores for the transformed feature

toy model for interactions between non-massive fermions intermediated by a
self-interacting real scalar field. This model has at stakes two symmetries at
the classical level that, as we know, might be spontaneously or dynamically
broken with mass generation for the particles. The auxiliary field method is
considered and it produces coupled renormalized gap equations. The effective
action is then written with quantum contributions by {the} external background

the physical gaps, investigate its properties, and discuss the connection
between the auxiliary fields not only to define composite states but also to
compute the effective action.

there is now ample evidence that it can lead to biased, unsafe, and prejudiced

especially as it reaches critical applications in social, industrial, and
medical domains. However, the non-convexity of most modern statistical problems
is only exacerbated by the introduction of constraints. Whereas good
unconstrained solutions can often be learned using empirical risk minimization,
even obtaining a model that satisfies statistical constraints can be
challenging. All the more so, a good one. In this paper, we overcome this issue
by learning in the empirical dual domain, where constrained statistical
learning problems become unconstrained and deterministic. We analyze the
generalization properties of this approach by bounding the empirical duality
gap -- i.e., the difference between our approximate, tractable solution and the
solution of the original (non-convex) statistical problem -- and provide a
practical constrained learning algorithm. These results establish a constrained
counterpart to classical learning theory, enabling the explicit use of
constraints in learning. We illustrate this theory and algorithm in
rate-constrained learning applications arising in fairness and adversarial
robustness.

n-grams (sn-grams). Sn-grams are a type of non-linear n-grams which have been
playing a critical role in many NLP tasks. Introducing sn-grams to comparing
document semantics thus is an appealing application, and few studies have
reported progress at this. However, when proceeding on this application, we
found three major issues of sn-grams: lack of significance, being sensitive to
word orders and failing on capture indirect syntactic relations. To address
these issues, we propose a new variant of sn-grams named generalized phrases
(GPs). Then based on GPs we propose a topological approach, named DSCoH, to
compute document semantic similarities. DSCoH has been extensively tested on
the document semantics comparison and the document clustering tasks. The
experimental results show that DSCoH can outperform state-of-the-art

datasets such as ImageNet. How accurate and robust are they to distribution
shifts arising from natural and synthetic variations in datasets? Prior
research on this problem has primarily focused on ImageNet variations (e.g.,
ImageNetV2, ImageNet-A). To avoid potential inherited biases in these studies,
we take a different approach. Specifically, we reanalyze the ObjectNet dataset
recently proposed by Barbu et al. containing objects in daily life situations.
They showed a dramatic performance drop of the state of the art object
recognition models on this dataset. Due to the importance and implications of
their results regarding the generalization ability of deep models, we take a
second look at their analysis. We find that applying deep models to the
isolated objects, rather than the entire scene as is done in the original
paper, results in around 20-30% performance improvement. Relative to the
numbers reported in Barbu et al., around 10-15% of the performance loss is
recovered, without any test time data augmentation. Despite this gain, however,
we conclude that deep models still suffer drastically on the ObjectNet dataset.
We also investigate the robustness of models against synthetic image
perturbations such as geometric transformations (e.g., scale, rotation,
translation), natural image distortions (e.g., impulse noise, blur) as well as
adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM and PGD-5). Our results indicate that limiting
the object area as much as possible (i.e., from the entire image to the

field, the magnitude of antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling, and the
thicknesses of ferromagnetic layers. Furthermore, the coupling between acoustic

the past decades; from manufacturing manually operated vehicles to
manufacturing vehicles with a high level of automation. With the recent
developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), automotive companies now employ
blackbox AI models to enable vehicles to perceive their environments and make
driving decisions with little or no input from a human. With the hope to deploy
autonomous vehicles (AV) on a commercial scale, the acceptance of AV by society
becomes paramount and may largely depend on their degree of transparency,
trustworthiness, and compliance with regulations. The assessment of the
compliance of AVs to these acceptance requirements can be facilitated through
the provision of explanations for AVs' behaviour. Explainability is therefore
seen as an important requirement for AVs. AVs should be able to explain what
they have 'seen', done, and might do in environments in which they operate.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing body of work
around explainable autonomous driving. First, we open with a motivation for
explanations by highlighting and emphasising the importance of transparency,
accountability, and trust in AVs; and examining existing regulations and
standards related to AVs. Second, we identify and categorise the different
stakeholders involved in the development, use, and regulation of AVs and elicit
their explanation requirements for AV. Third, we provide a rigorous review of
previous work on explanations for the different AV operations (i.e.,
perception, localisation, planning, control, and system management). Finally,
we identify pertinent challenges and provide recommendations, such as a
conceptual framework for AV explainability. This survey aims to provide the
fundamental knowledge required of researchers who are interested in
explainability in AVs.

beyond-silicon solid-state electronics and vacuum micro-nano-electronics.
Despite rapid progress in CNT field-effect transistor related solid-state
electronics, the development of CNT-based vacuum nanoelectronic devices is
substantially blocked by the longstanding challenges in demanding high-current
field-emission (FE) electron sources at low operating voltage. In addition to
CNTs' properties, FE characteristics are also affected by substrate morphology
and interface state. This work demonstrates high-current FE characteristics at
relatively low operating voltage by using CNT films grown directly on
commercially available 2.5D substrates with matched feature size and improved
interface contact. Simulation results indicate that the commercially available
2.5D substrate including nickel foam (NiF) and carbon cloth (CC) with
appropriate feature size would dramatically help to enhance emission current at
a relatively lower voltage. Modified fabrication process results in improved
contact between CNTs and the underlying 2.5D substrates. Twenty times higher
emission current density with halved lower turn-on electric field achieved by
CNTs grown directly on randomly picked NiF shows the potential of 2.5D
substrate with good contact in improving FE characteristics. Finally, a high
emission current (6 mA) with approximately 75 percent decrease in turn-on
electric field was realized by matching the feature size of 2.5D substrate with
that of CNTs, bringing us significantly closer to reliable high-current and
low-voltage FE electron sources for practical applications.

information stored, processed and exchanged between neighboring agents is
subject to deterministic uniform quantization) and relies on event-driven
updates (e.g., to reduce energy consumption, communication bandwidth, network
congestion, and/or processor usage). The main idea of the proposed algorithm is
that each node (i) models its initial state as two quantized fractions which
have numerators equal to the node's initial state and denominators equal to
one, and (ii) transmits one fraction randomly while it keeps the other stored.
Then, every time it receives one or more fractions, it averages their
numerators with the numerator of the fraction it stored, and then transmits
them to randomly selected out-neighbors. We characterize the properties of the
proposed distributed algorithm and show that its execution, on any static and
strongly connected digraph, allows each agent to reach in finite time a fixed

We address the issue of population privacy violations in this paper, and
propose a solution for the two main challenges. In this setting, the data owner
is required to release a valid context for the queried record, i.e. a context
in which the record is an outlier. Hence, the first major challenge is that the
privacy technique must preserve the validity of the context for each record. We
propose techniques to protect the privacy of individuals through a relaxed
notion of differential privacy to satisfy this requirement. The second major
challenge is applying the proposed techniques efficiently, as they impose
intensive computation to the base algorithm. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a graph structure to map the contexts to, and introduce differentially
private graph search algorithms as efficient solutions for the computation
problem caused by differential privacy techniques.

performance under no-fault conditions and also allow very fast fault recovery
to minimize downtime. In this paper, we present IterPro, a light-weight
compiler-assisted resilience technique to quickly and accurately recover
processes from transient-error-induced crashes. IterPro repairs the corrupted
process states on-the-fly upon occurrences of errors, enabling applications to
continue their executions instead of being terminated. IterPro also exploits
side effects introduced by induction variable based code optimization
techniques to improve its recovery capability. To this end, two new code
transformation passes are introduced to expose the side effects for resilience
purposes. We evaluated IterPro with 4 scientific workloads as well as the NPB
benchmarks suite. During their normal execution, IterPro incurs almost zero
runtime overhead and a small, fixed 27MB memory overhead. Meanwhile, IterPro
can recover on an average 83.55% of crash-causing errors within dozens of
milliseconds with negligible downtime. With such an effective recovery
mechanism, IterPro could tremendously mitigate the overheads and resource

problem, where the evolution of demand in response to posted prices is governed
by a stochastic variant of the popular Bass model with parameters $\alpha,
\beta$ that are linked to the so-called ""innovation"" and ""imitation"" effects.
Unlike the more commonly used i.i.d. and contextual demand models, in this
model the posted price not only affects the demand and the revenue in the
current round but also the future evolution of demand, and hence the fraction
of potential market size $m$ that can be ultimately captured. In this paper, we
consider the more challenging incomplete information problem where dynamic
pricing is applied in conjunction with learning the unknown parameters, with
the objective of optimizing the cumulative revenues over a given selling
horizon of length $T$. Equivalently, the goal is to minimize the regret which
measures the revenue loss of the algorithm relative to the optimal expected
revenue achievable under the stochastic Bass model with market size $m$ and
time horizon $T$. Our main contribution is the development of an algorithm that
satisfies a high probability regret guarantee of order $\tilde O(m^{2/3})$;
where the market size $m$ is known a priori. Moreover, we show that no
algorithm can incur smaller order of loss by deriving a matching lower bound.
Unlike most regret analysis results, in the present problem the market size $m$
is the fundamental driver of the complexity; our lower bound in fact, indicates
that for any fixed $\alpha, \beta$, most non-trivial instances of the problem
have constant $T$ and large $m$. We believe that this insight sets the problem
of dynamic pricing under the Bass model apart from the typical i.i.d. setting
and multi-armed bandit based models for dynamic pricing, which typically focus
only on the asymptotics with respect to time horizon $T$.

compare VR sickness, presence, workload to complete a search task, and
information loss of these three VR sickness mitigation methods in a racing game

the generalized Cayley metric is not easily computable in general. Therefore
the block permutation metric was introduced by Yang et al. [22] as the
generalized Cayley metric and the block permutation metric have the same
magnitude. However, the block permutation metric lacks the symmetry property
which restricts more advanced algebraic tools to be involved. In this paper, by
introducing a novel metric closely related to the block permutation metric, we
build a bridge between some advanced algebraic methods and codes in the block
permutation metric. More specifically, based on some techniques from algebraic
function fields originated in [19], we give an algebraic-geometric construction
of codes in the novel metric with reasonably good parameters. By observing a
trivial relation between the novel metric and block permutation metric, we then
produce non-systematic codes in block permutation metric that improve all known
results given in [21, 22]. More importantly, based on our non-systematic codes,
we provide an explicit and systematic construction of codes in block
permutation metric which improves the systematic result shown in [22]. In the
end, we demonstrate that our codes in the novel metric itself have reasonably
good parameters by showing that our construction beats the corresponding

influence of a thin wetting film trailing behind the displaced fluid, which
dynamically affects the pressure drop at the fluid-fluid interface by
introducing a nonlinear dependence on the interfacial velocity. In this
framework, two cases of interest are analyzed: The injection-driven flow
(expanding evolution), and the lifting plate flow (shrinking evolution). In
particular, we investigate the possibility of controlling the development of
fingering instabilities in these two different Hele-Shaw setups when wetting
effects are taken into account. By employing linear stability theory, we find
the proper time-dependent injection rate $Q(t)$ and the time-dependent lifting
speed ${\dot b}(t)$ required to control the number of emerging fingers during
the expanding and shrinking evolution, respectively. Our results indicate that
the consideration of wetting leads to an increase in the magnitude of $Q(t)$
[and ${\dot b}(t)$] in comparison to the non-wetting strategy. Moreover, a
spectrally accurate boundary integral approach is utilized to examine the
validity and effectiveness of the controlling protocols at the fully nonlinear
regime of the dynamics and confirms that the proposed injection and lifting
schemes are feasible strategies to prescribe the morphologies of the resulting
patterns in the presence of the wetting film.

backbone) of the percolation cluster, we have proposed and implemented a
modification of the well-known wall follower algorithm -- one type of maze
solving algorithm. The advantage of the modified algorithm is its
identification of the whole backbone without visiting all the edges. The
complexity of the algorithm depends significantly on the structure of the graph
and varies from $O\left(\sqrt{N_\text{V}}\right)$ to $\Theta(N_\text{V})$. The
algorithm has been applied to backbone identification in networks with
different number densities of conducting sticks. We have found that (i) for
number densities of sticks above the percolation threshold, the strength of the
percolation cluster quickly approaches unity as the number density of the
sticks increases; (ii) simultaneously, the percolation cluster becomes
identical to its backbone plus simplest dead ends, i.e., edges that are

vital insights into the radio afterglow properties of Advanced LIGO- and
Virgo-detected gravitational wave events, which will in turn inform follow-up
strategies to search for counterparts within their large positional
uncertainties. The ATCA was on target within 12.6 hr post-burst, when the
source had risen above the horizon. While no radio afterglow was detected
during the 8.3 hr observation, we obtained force-fitted flux densities of $7
\pm 12$ and $15 \pm 11~\mu$Jy at 5.5 and 9 GHz, respectively. Afterglow
modelling of GRB 181123B showed that the addition of the ATCA force-fitted
radio flux densities to the Swift X-ray Telescope detections provided more
stringent constraints on the fraction of thermal energy in the electrons
(log$\epsilon_e = -0.75^{+0.39}_{-0.40}$ rather than log$\epsilon_e =
-1.13^{+0.82}_{-1.2}$ derived without the inclusion of the ATCA values), which
is consistent with the range of typical $\epsilon_e$ derived from GRB afterglow
modelling. This allowed us to predict that the forward shock may have peaked in
the radio band $\sim10$ days post-burst, producing detectable radio emission
$\gtrsim3-4$ days post-burst. Overall, we demonstrate the potential for
extremely rapid radio follow-up of transients and the importance of triggered
radio observations for constraining GRB blast wave properties, regardless of
whether there is a detection, via the inclusion of force-fitted radio flux
densities in afterglow modelling efforts.

A key obstacle for accurate image registration lies in image appearance
variations such as the variations in texture, intensities, and noise. These
variations are readily apparent in medical images, especially in brain images
where registration is frequently used. Recently, deep learning-based
registration methods (DLRs), using deep neural networks, have shown
computational efficiency that is several orders of magnitude faster than
traditional optimization-based registration methods (ORs). DLRs rely on a
globally optimized network that is trained with a set of training samples to
achieve faster registration. DLRs tend, however, to disregard the
target-pair-specific optimization inherent in ORs and thus have degraded
adaptability to variations in testing samples. This limitation is severe for
registering medical images with large appearance variations, especially since
few existing DLRs explicitly take into account appearance variations. In this
study, we propose an Appearance Adjustment Network (AAN) to enhance the
adaptability of DLRs to appearance variations. Our AAN, when integrated into a
DLR, provides appearance transformations to reduce the appearance variations
during registration. In addition, we propose an anatomy-constrained loss
function through which our AAN generates anatomy-preserving transformations.
Our AAN has been purposely designed to be readily inserted into a wide range of

reconstruction. While achieving state-of-the-art performance, they are trained
and deployed specifically for one anatomy with limited generalization ability
to another anatomy. Rather than building multiple models, a universal model
that reconstructs images across different anatomies is highly desirable for
efficient deployment and better generalization. Simply mixing images from
multiple anatomies for training a single network does not lead to an ideal
universal model due to the statistical shift among datasets of various
anatomies, the need to retrain from scratch on all datasets with the addition
of a new dataset, and the difficulty in dealing with imbalanced sampling when
the new dataset is further of a smaller size. In this paper, for the first
time, we propose a framework to learn a universal deep neural network for
undersampled MRI reconstruction. Specifically, anatomy-specific instance
normalization is proposed to compensate for statistical shift and allow easy
generalization to new datasets. Moreover, the universal model is trained by
distilling knowledge from available independent models to further exploit
representations across anatomies. Experimental results show the proposed
universal model can reconstruct both brain and knee images with high image
quality. Also, it is easy to adapt the trained model to new datasets of smaller
size, i.e., abdomen, cardiac and prostate, with little effort and superior
performance.

supercurrent Ic can be modulated by an electrical gate which tunes the carrier
type and density of the TI film. Ic can reach a minimum when the TI is near the
charge neutrality regime with the Fermi energy lying close to the Dirac point
of the surface state. In the p-type regime the Josephson current can be well
described by a short ballistic junction model. In the n-type regime the
junction is ballistic at 0.7 K < T < 3.8 K while for T < 0.7 K the diffusive
bulk modes emerge and contribute a larger Ic than the ballistic model. We
attribute the lack of diffusive bulk modes in the p-type regime to the
formation of p-n junctions. Our work provides new clues for search of Majorana

a nearly edge-on $\approx 60\,\mathrm{day}$ orbit around the red giant star
V723 Monoceros as a black hole candidate in the mass gap. This scenario was
shown to explain most of the data presented by Jayasinghe et al. (2021), except
for periodic radial velocity (RV) residuals from the circular Keplerian model.
Here we show that the RV residuals are explained by orbital phase-dependent
distortion of the absorption line profile associated with changing visible
fractions of the approaching and receding sides of the red giant star, whose
surface is tidally deformed by and rotating synchronously with the dark
companion. Our RV model constrains the companion mass $M_\bullet =
2.95\pm0.17\,M_\odot$ and orbital inclination
$i=82.9^{+7.0}_{-3.3}\,\mathrm{deg}$ (medians and 68.3% highest density
intervals of the marginal posteriors) adopting the radius of the red giant
$24.0\pm0.9\,R_\odot$ as constrained from its SED and distance. The analysis
provides independent support for the companion mass from ellipsoidal variations
and the limits on the companion's luminosity from the absence of eclipses both
derived by Jayasinghe et al. (2021). We also show that a common scheme to
evaluate the tidal RV signal as the flux-weighted mean of the surface velocity
field can significantly underestimate its amplitude for RVs measured with a
cross-correlation technique, and present a modified prescription that directly
models the distorted line profile and its effects on the measured RVs. The
formulation will be useful for estimating the component masses and inclinations
in other similar binaries.

medical image analysis and has been considered a replacement for conventional
radiomics that relies on handcrafted features. In this study, we aimed to
explore the capability of DLR for the prediction of 5-year Progression-Free
Survival (PFS) in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) using pretreatment PET/CT.
Methods: A total of 257 patients (170/87 in internal/external cohorts) with
advanced NPC (TNM stage III or IVa) were enrolled. We developed an end-to-end
multi-modality DLR model, in which a 3D convolutional neural network was
optimized to extract deep features from pretreatment PET/CT images and predict
the probability of 5-year PFS. TNM stage, as a high-level clinical feature,
could be integrated into our DLR model to further improve the prognostic
performance. To compare conventional radiomics and DLR, 1456 handcrafted
features were extracted, and optimal conventional radiomics methods were
selected from 54 cross-combinations of 6 feature selection methods and 9
classification methods. In addition, risk group stratification was performed
with clinical signature, conventional radiomics signature, and DLR signature.
Results: Our multi-modality DLR model using both PET and CT achieved higher
prognostic performance than the optimal conventional radiomics method.
Furthermore, the multi-modality DLR model outperformed single-modality DLR
models using only PET or only CT. For risk group stratification, the
conventional radiomics signature and DLR signature enabled significant
differences between the high- and low-risk patient groups in both internal and
external cohorts, while the clinical signature failed in the external cohort.
Conclusion: Our study identified potential prognostic tools for survival
prediction in advanced NPC, suggesting that DLR could provide complementary
values to the current TNM staging.

different types of medical images. In this paper, we propose an image-based
medical adversarial attack method to consistently produce adversarial
perturbations on medical images. The objective function of our method consists
of a loss deviation term and a loss stabilization term. The loss deviation term
increases the divergence between the CNN prediction of an adversarial example
and its ground truth label. Meanwhile, the loss stabilization term ensures
similar CNN predictions of this example and its smoothed input. From the
perspective of the whole iterations for perturbation generation, the proposed
loss stabilization term exhaustively searches the perturbation space to smooth
the single spot for local optimum escape. We further analyze the KL-divergence
of the proposed loss function and find that the loss stabilization term makes
the perturbations updated towards a fixed objective spot while deviating from
the ground truth. This stabilization ensures the proposed medical attack
effective for different types of medical images while producing perturbations
in small variance. Experiments on several medical image analysis benchmarks
including the recent COVID-19 dataset show the stability of the proposed
method.

typical quality requirements classes? What modelling concepts do we rely on or
which levels of abstraction do we need to consider? In fact, how to integrate
such concepts into approaches for a more traditional RE still needs profound
investigations. In this research preview paper, we report on ongoing efforts to
establish an artefact-based RE approach for the development of datacentric

general validity of the transfer matrix analysis, and clarify the symmetry
properties of the Lyapunov exponents, scattering ($S$) matrix and two-terminal
conductance in these NH models. The unitarity of the $S$ matrix is violated in
NH systems, where the two-terminal conductance can take arbitrarily large
values. Nonetheless, we show that the transposition symmetry of a Hamiltonian
leads to the symmetric nature of the $S$ matrix as well as the reciprocal
symmetries of the Lyapunov exponents and conductance in certain ways in these
NH models. Finite size scaling data are fitted by polynomial functions, from
which we determine the critical exponent $\nu$ at different single-particle
energies and system parameters of the NH models. We conclude that the critical
exponents of the NH class AI$^{\dagger}$ and the NH class A are $\nu=1.19 \pm
0.01$ and $\nu=1.00 \pm 0.04$, respectively. In the NH models, a distribution
of the two-terminal conductance is not Gaussian. Instead, it contains small
fractions of huge conductance values, which come from rare-event states with
huge transmissions amplified by on-site NH disorders. Nonetheless, a geometric
mean of the conductance enables the finite-size scaling analysis. We show that
the critical exponents obtained from the conductance analysis are consistent
with those from the localization length in these three NH models.

by controlling for the number of model parameters (and hence model capacity),
we show that the additional benefit in accuracy is indeed due to the higher
input resolution. Preliminary empirical investigation over MNIST, Fashion
MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed
approach.

When a single polariton exists in a trapped-ion chain, the polariton hops
between the ion sites. On the other hand, when there are single polaritons at
each ion site, the hopping of the polaritons is suppressed because of the
polariton-polariton interaction induced by the nonlinearity of the
anti-Jaynes-Cummings interaction, thereby realizing the blockade of polariton

labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Existing self-training
based UDA approaches assign pseudo labels for target data and treat them as
ground truth labels to fully leverage unlabeled target data for model
adaptation. However, the generated pseudo labels from the model optimized on
the source domain inevitably contain noise due to the domain gap. To tackle
this issue, we advance a MetaCorrection framework, where a Domain-aware
Meta-learning strategy is devised to benefit Loss Correction (DMLC) for UDA
semantic segmentation. In particular, we model the noise distribution of pseudo
labels in target domain by introducing a noise transition matrix (NTM) and
construct meta data set with domain-invariant source data to guide the
estimation of NTM. Through the risk minimization on the meta data set, the
optimized NTM thus can correct the noisy issues in pseudo labels and enhance
the generalization ability of the model on the target data. Considering the
capacity gap between shallow and deep features, we further employ the proposed
DMLC strategy to provide matched and compatible supervision signals for
different level features, thereby ensuring deep adaptation. Extensive
experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our method against existing

quantified through $A_{\rm g}$, the dimensionless prefactor of the universal

the brain into cortical areas and subcortical nuclei, links structure with
connectivity and function, and provides a microstructural reference for human
brain atlases. Mapping boundaries between areas requires to scan histological
sections at microscopic resolution. While recent high-throughput scanners allow
to scan a complete human brain in the order of a year, it is practically
impossible to delineate regions at the same pace using the established gold
standard method. Researchers have recently addressed cytoarchitectonic mapping
of cortical regions with deep neural networks, relying on image patches from
individual 2D sections for classification. However, the 3D context, which is
needed to disambiguate complex or obliquely cut brain regions, is not taken
into account. In this work, we combine 2D histology with 3D topology by
reformulating the mapping task as a node classification problem on an
approximate 3D midsurface mesh through the isocortex. We extract deep features

cytoarchitecture, and assign them to the corresponding nodes on the 3D mesh to
construct a large attributed graph. By solving the brain mapping problem on

common in skeletal motions, in contrast to the common belief that adversarial
samples only exist off-manifold. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison,
we show that BASAR can deliver successful attacks across models, data, and

performance, this also increases model complexity and memory footprint, making
a dual-stage classifier difficult to implement in a wearable device with
limited resources. In this paper, we present sensor fusion of accelerometer and
EMG signals using a hyperdimensional computing model to emulate dual-stage
classification in a memory-efficient way. We demonstrate two methods of
encoding accelerometer features to act as keys for retrieval of

to locate temporal regions in real-world untrimmed videos where actions occur
and recognize their classes. It is widely acknowledged that video context is a
critical cue for video understanding, and exploiting the context has become an
important strategy to boost localization performance. However, previous
state-of-the-art methods focus more on exploring semantic context which
captures the feature similarity among frames or proposals, and neglect
positional context which is vital for temporal localization. In this paper, we
propose a temporal-position-sensitive context modeling approach to incorporate
both positional and semantic information for more precise action localization.
Specifically, we first augment feature representations with directed temporal
positional encoding, and then conduct attention-based information propagation,
in both frame-level and proposal-level. Consequently, the generated feature

pairwise relationships in a deterministic manner. However, we argue that visual

Ambiguity, Hyponymy Ambiguity, and Multi-view Ambiguity. The ambiguity
naturally leads to the issue of \emph{implicit multi-label}, motivating the
need for diverse predictions. In this work, we propose a novel plug-and-play
Probabilistic Uncertainty Modeling (PUM) module. It models each union region as
a Gaussian distribution, whose variance measures the uncertainty of the
corresponding visual content. Compared to the conventional deterministic
methods, such uncertainty modeling brings stochasticity of feature
representation, which naturally enables diverse predictions. As a byproduct,
PUM also manages to cover more fine-grained relationships and thus alleviates
the issue of bias towards frequent relationships. Extensive experiments on the
large-scale Visual Genome benchmark show that combining PUM with newly proposed
ResCAGCN can achieve state-of-the-art performances, especially under the mean
recall metric. Furthermore, we prove the universal effectiveness of PUM by
plugging it into some existing models and provide insightful analysis of its
ability to generate diverse yet plausible visual relationships.

the conformal structure on smooth surfaces, which includes tangential circle
packing, Thurston's circle packing, inversive distance circle packing and
vertex scaling as special cases and generalizes them to a very general context.
Glickenstein conjectured the rigidity of discrete conformal structures on
polyhedral surfaces, which includes Luo's conjecture on the rigidity of vertex
scaling and Bowers-Stephenson's conjecture on the rigidity of inversive
distance circle packings on polyhedral surfaces as special cases. In this
paper, we prove Glickenstein's conjecture using a variational principle.
  We further study the deformation of discrete conformal structures on
polyhedral surfaces by combinatorial curvature flows. It is proved that the
combinatorial Ricci flow for discrete conformal structures, which is a
generalization of Chow-Luo's combinatorial Ricci flow for circle packings and
Luo's combinatorial Yamabe flow for vertex scaling, could be extended to exist
for all time and the extended combinatorial Ricci flow converges exponentially
fast for any initial data if the discrete conformal structure with prescribed
combinatorial curvature exists. This confirms another conjecture of
Glickenstein on the convergence of the combinatorial Ricci flow and provides an
effective algorithm for finding discrete conformal structures with prescribed
combinatorial curvatures.
  The relationship of discrete conformal structures on polyhedral surfaces and
3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry is also discussed. As a result, we obtain
some new convexities of the co-volume functions for some generalized

allow us to determine the orbital parameters associated with the binary black
hole (BBH) central engine. In contrast, the radio jet of OJ 287 has been
covered with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations for only
about $30$ years and these observations reveal that the position angle (PA) of
the jet exhibits temporal variations at both millimetre and centimetre
wavelengths. Here we associate the observed PA variations in OJ 287 with the
precession of its radio jet. In our model, the evolution of the jet direction
can be associated either with the primary black hole (BH) spin evolution or
with the precession of the angular momentum direction of the inner region of
the accretion disc. Our Bayesian analysis shows that the BBH central engine

the observed temporal variations in the radio jet of OJ 287 at frequencies of

paper I by Lapi & Danese (2020) to derive the (conditional) halo progenitor
mass function and the related large-scale bias. Specifically, we present a
stochastic differential equation that describes fluctuations in the mass growth
of progenitor halos of given descendant mass and redshift, as driven by a
multiplicative Gaussian white noise involving the power spectrum and the
spherical collapse threshold of density perturbations. We demonstrate that, as
cosmic time passes, the noise yields an average drift of the progenitors toward
larger masses, that quantitatively renders the expectation from the standard
extended Press & Schechter (EPS) theory. We solve the Fokker-Planck equation
associated to the stochastic dynamics, and obtain as an exact, stationary
solution the EPS progenitor mass function. Then we introduce a modification of
the stochastic equation in terms of a mass-dependent collapse threshold
modulating the noise, and solve analytically the associated Fokker-Planck
equation for the progenitor mass function. The latter is found to be in
excellent agreement with the outcomes of $N-$body simulations; even more
remarkably, this is achieved with the same shape of the collapse threshold used
in paper I to reproduce the halo mass function. Finally, we exploit the above
results to compute the large-scale halo bias, and find it in pleasing agreement
with the $N-$body outcomes. All in all, the present paper illustrates that the
stochastic theory of hierarchical clustering introduced in paper I can describe
effectively not only halos' abundance, but also their progenitor distribution
and their correlation with the large-scale environment across cosmic times.

Griffiths' seminal 1984 paper, the first physicist to have proposed a

a variety of areas, like natural language processing and computer vision. To
this end, employing deep learning techniques to thwart Android malware attacks
has recently garnered considerable research attention. Yet, no systematic
literature review focusing on deep learning approaches for Android Malware
defenses exists. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review to
search and analyze how deep learning approaches have been applied in the
context of malware defenses in the Android environment. As a result, a total of
132 studies covering the period 2014-2021 were identified. Our investigation
reveals that, while the majority of these sources mainly consider DL-based on
Android malware detection, 53 primary studies (40.1 percent) design defense

remote sensing (RS) images are acquired. To find useful information from these
images, cross-modal RS image-voice retrieval provides a new insight. This paper
aims to study the task of RS image-voice retrieval so as to search effective
information from massive amounts of RS data. Existing methods for RS
image-voice retrieval rely primarily on the pairwise relationship to narrow the
heterogeneous semantic gap between images and voices. However, apart from the
pairwise relationship included in the datasets, the intra-modality and
non-paired inter-modality relationships should also be taken into account
simultaneously, since the semantic consistency among non-paired representations
plays an important role in the RS image-voice retrieval task. Inspired by this,
a semantics-consistent representation learning (SCRL) method is proposed for RS
image-voice retrieval. The main novelty is that the proposed method takes the
pairwise, intra-modality, and non-paired inter-modality relationships into
account simultaneously, thereby improving the semantic consistency of the
learned representations for the RS image-voice retrieval. The proposed SCRL
method consists of two main steps: 1) semantics encoding and 2)
semantics-consistent representation learning. Firstly, an image encoding
network is adopted to extract high-level image features with a transfer
learning strategy, and a voice encoding network with dilated convolution is
devised to obtain high-level voice features. Secondly, a consistent
representation space is conducted by modeling the three kinds of relationships
to narrow the heterogeneous semantic gap and learn semantics-consistent
representations across two modalities. Extensive experimental results on three
challenging RS image-voice datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

learning. However, they do not fully take advantage of the low-level contrast
features while generating the visual attention map. In this paper, a novel VAP
method is proposed to generate visual attention map via bio-inspired
representation learning. The bio-inspired representation learning combines both
low-level contrast and high-level semantic features simultaneously, which are
developed by the fact that human eye is sensitive to the patches with high
contrast and objects with high semantics. The proposed method is composed of
three main steps: 1) feature extraction, 2) bio-inspired representation
learning and 3) visual attention map generation. Firstly, the high-level
semantic feature is extracted from the refined VGG16, while the low-level
contrast feature is extracted by the proposed contrast feature extraction block
in a deep network. Secondly, during bio-inspired representation learning, both
the extracted low-level contrast and high-level semantic features are combined
by the designed densely connected block, which is proposed to concatenate
various features scale by scale. Finally, the weighted-fusion layer is
exploited to generate the ultimate visual attention map based on the obtained
representations after bio-inspired representation learning. Extensive
experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

optimized crystal structures reveals that the Y$_2$C$_2$ blocks are compressed
uniaxially upon the halogen substitution from Cl, Br to I, contrary to the
monotonic expansion of the lattice vectors. With a nonempirical method based on
the density functional theory for superconductors within the conventional
phonon mechanism, we successfully reproduce the halogen dependence of $T_{\rm

Y$_2$I$_2$C$_2$, which imply possible departure from the conventional pairing
picture. Utilizing the Wannier representation of the electron-phonon coupling,
we show that the halogen electronic orbitals and ionic vibrations scarcely
contribute to the superconducting pairing. The halogen dependence of this
system is hence an indirect effect of the halogen ions through the uniaxial
compressive force on the superconducting Y$_2$C$_2$ blocks. We thus establish a
quantitatively reliable picture of the superconducting physics of this system,
extracting a unique effect of the atomic substitution which is potentially
applicable to other superconductors.

Multi-Type Tree (MTT) block partitioning structure that supports Binary-Tree

This new approach leads to five possible splits at each block depth and thereby
improves the coding efficiency of VVC over that of the preceding High
Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, which only supports Quad-Tree (QT)
partitioning with a single split per block depth. However, MTT also has brought
a considerable impact on encoder computational complexity. In this paper, a
two-stage learning-based technique is proposed to tackle the complexity
overhead of MTT in VVC intra encoders. In our scheme, the input block is first
processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict its spatial
features through a vector of probabilities describing the partition at each 4x4
edge. Subsequently, a Decision Tree (DT) model leverages this vector of spatial
features to predict the most likely splits at each block. Finally, based on
this prediction, only the N most likely splits are processed by the
Rate-Distortion (RD) process of the encoder. In order to train our CNN and DT
models on a wide range of image contents, we also propose a public VVC frame
partitioning dataset based on existing image dataset encoded with the VVC
reference software encoder. Our proposal relying on the top-3 configuration
reaches 46.6% complexity reduction for a negligible bitrate increase of 0.86%.
A top-2 configuration enables a higher complexity reduction of 69.8% for 2.57%

call active testing. While approaches like active learning reduce the number of
labels needed for model training, existing literature largely ignores the cost
of labeling test data, typically unrealistically assuming large test sets for
model evaluation. This creates a disconnect to real applications, where test
labels are important and just as expensive, e.g. for optimizing
hyperparameters. Active testing addresses this by carefully selecting the test
points to label, ensuring model evaluation is sample-efficient. To this end, we
derive theoretically-grounded and intuitive acquisition strategies that are
specifically tailored to the goals of active testing, noting these are distinct
to those of active learning. As actively selecting labels introduces a bias; we
further show how to remove this bias while reducing the variance of the
estimator at the same time. Active testing is easy to implement and can be
applied to any supervised machine learning method. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on models including WideResNets and Gaussian processes on
datasets including Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-100.

system which may serve as a blueprint for the design of synthetic MC systems.
However, the physical modeling of synaptic MC is complicated by the possible
saturation of the molecular receiver caused by the competition of
neurotransmitters (NTs) for postsynaptic receptors. Receiver saturation renders
the system behavior nonlinear in the number of released NTs and is commonly
neglected in existing analytical models. Furthermore, due to the ligands'
competition for receptors (and vice versa), the individual binding events at
the molecular receiver are in general statistically dependent and the binomial
model for the statistics of the received signal does not apply. In this work,
we propose a novel deterministic model for receptor saturation in terms of a
state-space description based on an eigenfunction expansion of Fick's diffusion
equation. The presented solution is numerically stable and computationally
efficient. Employing the proposed deterministic model, we show that saturation
at the molecular receiver reduces the peak-value of the expected received
signal and accelerates the clearance of NTs as compared to the case when
receptor occupancy is neglected. We further derive a statistical model for the
received signal in terms of the hypergeometric distribution which accounts for
the competition of NTs for receptors and the competition of receptors for NTs.
The proposed statistical model reveals how the signal statistics are shaped by
the number of released NTs, the number of receptors, and the binding kinetics
of the receptors, respectively, in the presence of competition. We show that
the impact of these parameters on the signal variance depends on the relative
numbers of NTs and receptors. The accuracy of the proposed deterministic and
statistical models is verified by particle-based computer simulations.

design understandable and verifiable behaviors for swarms of robots. The
framework is based on the automatic extraction of two distinct models: 1) a
neural network model trained to estimate the relationship between the robots'
sensor readings and the global performance of the swarm, and 2) a probabilistic
state transition model that explicitly models the local state transitions
(i.e., transitions in observations from the perspective of a single robot in
the swarm) given a policy. The models can be trained from a data set of
simulated runs featuring random policies. The first model is used to
automatically extract a set of local states that are expected to maximize the
global performance. These local states are referred to as desired local states.
The second model is used to optimize a stochastic policy so as to increase the
probability that the robots in the swarm observe one of the desired local
states. Following these steps, the framework proposed in this paper can
efficiently lead to effective controllers. This is tested on four case studies,
featuring aggregation and foraging tasks. Importantly, thanks to the models,
the framework allows us to understand and inspect a swarm's behavior. To this
end, we propose verification checks to identify some potential issues that may
prevent the swarm from achieving the desired global objective. In addition, we
explore how the framework can be used in combination with a ""standard""
evolutionary robotics strategy (i.e., where performance is measured via

that the methodology here presented, based on the MHD evolution of the equation

  through Functional Electrical Stimulation",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human movement disorders or paralysis lead to the loss of control of muscle
activation and thus motor control. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is
an established and safe technique for contracting muscles by stimulating the
skin above a muscle to induce its contraction. However, an open challenge
remains on how to restore motor abilities to human limbs through FES, as the
problem of controlling the stimulation is unclear. We are taking a robotics
perspective on this problem, by developing robot learning algorithms that
control the ultimate humanoid robot, the human body, through electrical muscle
stimulation. Human muscles are not trivial to control as actuators due to their
force production being non-stationary as a result of fatigue and other internal
state changes, in contrast to robot actuators which are well-understood and
stationary over broad operation ranges. We present our Deep Reinforcement
Learning approach to the control of human muscles with FES, using a recurrent
neural network for dynamic state representation, to overcome the unobserved
elements of the behaviour of human muscles under external stimulation. We
demonstrate our technique both in neuromuscular simulations but also
experimentally on a human. Our results show that our controller can learn to
manipulate human muscles, applying appropriate levels of stimulation to achieve
the given tasks while compensating for advancing muscle fatigue which arises
throughout the tasks. Additionally, our technique can learn quickly enough to
be implemented in real-world human-in-the-loop settings.

decode EEG and have become the benchmark for motor imagery EEG
Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) decoding. However, it is still challenging to
train CNNs on multiple subjects' EEG without decreasing individual performance.
This is known as the negative transfer problem, i.e. learning from dissimilar
distributions causes CNNs to misrepresent each of them instead of learning a
richer representation. As a result, CNNs cannot directly use multiple subjects'
EEG to enhance model performance directly. To address this problem, we extend
deep transfer learning techniques to the EEG multi-subject training case. We
propose a multi-branch deep transfer network, the Separate-Common-Separate
Network (SCSN) based on splitting the network's feature extractors for
individual subjects. We also explore the possibility of applying Maximum-mean
discrepancy (MMD) to the SCSN (SCSN-MMD) to better align distributions of
features from individual feature extractors. The proposed network is evaluated
on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset (BCICIV2a dataset) and our online recorded

(81.8%, 54.8%) outperformed the benchmark CNN (73.4%, 48.8%) on both datasets

larger multi-subject datasets to train an EEG decoder without being influenced

been designed for specific attacks or broken by others, need knowledge about
the attacks, are not consistent, increase model parameters overhead, are
time-consuming, or have latency in inference time. To trade off these factors,
we revisit the model's uncertainty and confidences and propose a novel
unsupervised ensemble AE detection mechanism that 1) uses the uncertainty
method called SelectiveNet, 2) processes model layers outputs, i.e.feature

Selective and Feature based Adversarial Detection (SFAD). Experimental results

potential of caustic magnesia to be used as a binder in such systems due to its
high reactivity, it is still a challenge to control the hydration reaction rate
of this oxide and the negative effects derived from the expansive feature of
Mg(OH)2 formation. Thus, this work evaluated the incorporation of different

castables, aiming to control the brucite precipitation during the curing and
drying steps of the prepared samples, resulting in crack-free refractories. The
designed compositions were characterized via flowability, setting behavior,
X-ray diffraction, cold flexural strength, porosity, permeability and
thermogravimetric measurements. According to the results, instead of Mg(OH)2,
hydrotalcite-like phases [Mg6Al2(OH)16(OH)2.4.5H2O and Mg6Al2(OH)16(CO3).4H2O]
were the main hydrated phases identified in the AHL-containing compositions.
The addition of 1.0 wt.% of aluminum hydroxyl lactate to the designed castable

Exponential Utility function, the dimension of the problem can be reduced, but
one has to deal with high absolute values in the objective function. In this
paper, we propose two changes of variables that reduce the impact of the

vehicle Re-identification (ReID), since the visual appearance of vehicles
changes significantly under different viewpoints. To this end, most existing

viewpoints annotations, which however, is difficult to deploy in real
applications due to the expensive labelling cost and the continous viewpoint
variation that makes it hard to define discrete viewpoint labels. In this
study, we present a pluggable Weakly-supervised Cross-View Learning (WCVL)

hardest positive counterparts in feature domain, we can learn the consistent
feature representation via minimizing the cross-view feature distance based on
vehicle IDs only without using any viewpoint annotation. More importantly, the
proposed method can be seamlessly plugged into most existing vehicle ReID
baselines for cross-view learning without re-training the baselines. To

spirals has become a common outcome of high spatial resolution imaging of
protoplanetary disks, both in the near-infrared scattered light and in the
thermal millimetre continuum emission. The most frequent interpretation of
their origin is the presence of planetary-mass companions perturbing the gas
and dust distribution in the disk (perturbers), but so far the only bona-fide
detection has been the two giant planets around PDS 70. Here, we collect a
sample of 15 protoplanetary disks showing substructures in SPHERE scattered
light images and present a homogeneous derivation of planet detection limits in
these systems. We also estimate the mass of these perturbers through a Hill
radius prescription and a comparison to ALMA data. Assuming that one single
planet carves each substructure in scattered light, we find that more massive
perturbers are needed to create gaps within cavities than rings, and that we
might be close to a detection in the cavities of RX J1604, RX J1615, Sz Cha, HD
135344B and HD 34282. We reach typical mass limits in these cavities of 3-10
Mjup. For planets in the gaps between rings, we find that the detection limits
of SPHERE are about an order of magnitude away in mass, and that the gaps of
PDS 66 and HD 97048 seem to be the most promising structures for planet
searches. The proposed presence of massive planets causing spiral features in
HD 135344B and HD 36112 are also within SPHERE's reach assuming hot-start
models.These results suggest that current detection limits are able to detect
hot-start planets in cavities, under the assumption that they are formed by a
single perturber located at the centre of the cavity. More realistic planet
mass constraints would help to clarify whether this is actually the case, which
might point to perturbers not being the only way of creating substructures.

cheap gradient descent per iteration while preserving the same order of

detected, without establishing if its origin is thermal (from a gas with very
high temperature) or non-thermal. In this paper we study how thermal and
non-thermal contributions to the SZ effect in the cavities are related; in
fact, Coulomb interactions with the thermal gas modify the spectrum of low
energy non-thermal electrons, which dominate the non-thermal SZ effect; as a
consequence, the intensity of the non-thermal SZ effect is stronger for lower
density of the thermal gas inside the cavity. We calculate the non-thermal SZ
effect in the cavities as a function of the thermal density, and compare the SZ
effects produced by thermal and non-thermal components, and with the one from
the external Intra Cluster Medium (ICM), searching for the best frequency range
where it is possible to disentangle the different contributions. We find that
for temperatures inside the cavities higher than $\sim1500$ keV the non-thermal
SZ effect is expected to dominate on the thermal one, particularly at high
frequencies ($\nu>500$ GHz), where it can also be a non-negligible fraction of
the SZ effect from the external ICM. We also discuss the possible sources of
astrophysical bias (as kinetic SZ effect and foreground emission from Galactic
dust) and possible ways to address them, as well as necessary improvements in
the modeling of the properties of cavities and the ICM.

formation evaluation obtained by well-log interpretation while drilling. A
reliable, computationally efficient, and robust workflow to interpret well logs
and capture uncertainties in real-time is necessary for this application. An
iterative ensemble-based method, namely the approximate Levenberg Marquardt
form of the Ensemble Randomized Maximum Likelihood (LM-EnRML) is integrated in
our formation evaluation workflow. We estimate model parameters, resistivity
and density in addition to boundary locations, and related uncertainties by
reducing the statistical misfit between the measurements from the well logging
tools and the theoretical measurements from the forward tool simulators. The
results of analyzing several synthetic cases with several types of logs
verified that the proposed method can give good estimate of model parameters.
  By comparing the CPU time, we conclude that the proposed method has at least
about 10--125 times lower computational time compare to a common statistical
method, such as Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo. In addition, the
ensemble-based method can run in parallel on multiple CPUs. Testing the method
on a case inspired from a real field also yielded accurate formation
evaluation. Thus, the proposed ensemble-based method has been proven robust and
computationally efficient to estimate petrophysical formation properties, layer
boundaries and their uncertainties, indicating that it is suitable for
geosteering.

data-centric applications, this data is streaming; new items arrive
continuously, and the data grows with time. With paradigms such as Internet of
Things and Edge Computing, such applications become more natural and more
practical. In this work, we assume a streaming model where the data is modeled
as a hypergraph, which is generated at the edge. This data then partitioned and
sent to remote nodes via an algorithm running on a memory-restricted device
such as a single board computer. Such a partitioning is usually performed by
taking a connectivity metric into account to minimize the communication cost of
later analyses that will be performed in a distributed fashion. Although there
are many offline tools that can partition static hypergraphs excellently,
algorithms for the streaming settings are rare. We analyze a well-known
algorithm from the literature and significantly improve its running time by
altering its inner data structure. For instance, on a medium-scale hypergraph,
the new algorithm reduces the runtime from 17800 seconds to 10 seconds. We then
propose sketch- and hash-based algorithms, as well as ones that can leverage
extra memory to store a small portion of the data to enable the refinement of
partitioning when possible. We experimentally analyze the performance of these

uses on a high-end server and four different single-board computer

interaction (HOI) detection. HOIs are so diverse in spatial distribution in an
image that existing CNN-based methods face the following three major drawbacks;
they cannot leverage image-wide features due to CNN's locality, they rely on a
manually defined location-of-interest for the feature aggregation, which
sometimes does not cover contextually important regions, and they cannot help
but mix up the features for multiple HOI instances if they are located closely.
To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a transformer-based feature extractor,
in which an attention mechanism and query-based detection play key roles. The
attention mechanism is effective in aggregating contextually important
information image-wide, while the queries, which we design in such a way that
each query captures at most one human-object pair, can avoid mixing up the
features from multiple instances. This transformer-based feature extractor
produces so effective embeddings that the subsequent detection heads may be
fairly simple and intuitive. The extensive analysis reveals that the proposed
method successfully extracts contextually important features, and thus
outperforms existing methods by large margins (5.37 mAP on HICO-DET, and 5.7
mAP on V-COCO). The source codes are available at

to grasp a pre-assigned goal object in clutter and needs some pre-grasp actions
such as pushes to enable stable grasps. However, in this task, the robot gets
positive rewards from environment only when successfully grasping the goal
object. Besides, joint pushing and grasping elongates the action sequence,
compounding the problem of reward delay. Thus, sample inefficiency remains a
main challenge in this task. In this paper, a goal-conditioned hierarchical
reinforcement learning formulation with high sample efficiency is proposed to
learn a push-grasping policy for grasping a specific object in clutter. In our
work, sample efficiency is improved by two means. First, we use a
goal-conditioned mechanism by goal relabeling to enrich the replay buffer.
Second, the pushing and grasping policies are respectively regarded as a
generator and a discriminator and the pushing policy is trained with
supervision of the grasping discriminator, thus densifying pushing rewards. To
deal with the problem of distribution mismatch caused by different training
settings of two policies, an alternating training stage is added to learn
pushing and grasping in turn. A series of experiments carried out in simulation
and real world indicate that our method can quickly learn effective pushing and
grasping policies and outperforms existing methods in task completion rate and
goal grasp success rate by less times of motion. Furthermore, we validate that
our system can also adapt to goal-agnostic conditions with better performance.
Note that our system can be transferred to the real world without any

world are determined to replace the current institution-centered health systems
with new patient-centered ones. In these new systems, all the health
information of a patient is integrated into a unique global vision. However,
some questions are still unanswered. Specifically, who should store and
maintain the information of a given patient and how should this information be
made available for other systems. To address this situation, this work proposes
a new solution towards making the Personal Health Trajectory of patients
available for both, the patients themselves and health institutions. By using
the concept of blockchains' federation and web services access to the global
vision of a person health can be granted to existing and new solutions. To
demonstrate the viability of the proposal, an implementation is provided
alongside the obtained results in a potential scenario.

unparalleled performance at the cost of large computational complexity. In this
work, we propose an Efficient Multi-stage Video Denoising algorithm, called
EMVD, to drastically reduce the complexity while maintaining or even improving
the performance. First, a fusion stage reduces the noise through a recursive
combination of all past frames in the video. Then, a denoising stage removes
the noise in the fused frame. Finally, a refinement stage restores the missing
high frequency in the denoised frame. All stages operate on a transform-domain
representation obtained by learnable and invertible linear operators which
simultaneously increase accuracy and decrease complexity of the model. A single
loss on the final output is sufficient for successful convergence, hence making
EMVD easy to train. Experiments on real raw data demonstrate that EMVD
outperforms the state of the art when complexity is constrained, and even
remains competitive against methods whose complexities are several orders of
magnitude higher. Further, the low complexity and memory requirements of EMVD
enable real-time video denoising on commercial SoC in mobile devices.

(EoS) of Neutron Star with multimessenger data. As an universal function
approximator, the Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) with one hidden layer and
a sigmoidal activation function can approximately fit any continuous function.
Thus we are able to implement the nonparametric FFNN representation of the
EoSs. This new representation is validated by its capabilities of fitting the
theoretical EoSs and recovering the injected parameters. Then we adopt this
nonparametric method to analyze the real data, including mass-tidal
deformability measurement from the Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger
Gravitational Wave (GW) event GW170817 and mass-radius measurement of PSR
J0030+0451 by {\it NICER}. We take the publicly available samples to construct
the likelihood and use the nested sampling to obtain the posteriors of the
parameters of FFNN according to the Bayesian theorem, which in turn can be
translated to the posteriors of EoS parameters. Combining all these data, for a
canonical 1.4 $M_\odot$ neutron star, we get the radius
$R_{1.4}=11.83^{+1.25}_{-1.08}$ km and the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4} =
323^{+334}_{-165}$ (90\% confidence interval).Furthermore, we find that in the
high density region ($\geq 3\rho_{\rm sat}$), the 90\% lower limits of the
$c_{\rm s}^2/c^2$ ($c_{\rm s}$ is the sound speed and $c$ is the velocity of
light in the vacuum) are above $1/3$, which means that the so-called conformal
limit (i.e., $c_{\rm s}^2/c^2<1/3$) is not always valid in the neutron stars.

magnetic susceptibility in the framework of linear response time-dependent
density functional theory. The dynamic susceptibility allows one to obtain the
magnon dispersion as well as magnon lifetimes for a particular material, which
strongly facilitates the interpretation of inelastic neutron scattering
experiments as well as other spectroscopic techniques. We apply the method to
Fe, Ni, and Co and perform a thorough convergence analysis with respect the
basis set size, $k$-point sampling, spectral smearing and unoccupied bands. In
particular, it is shown that while the gap error (acoustic magnon energy at
$\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{0}$) is highly challenging to converge, the spin-wave
stiffness and the dispersion relation itself are much less sensitive to
convergence parameters. Our final results agrees well with experimentally
extracted magnon dispersion relations except for Ni, where it is well-known
that the exchange splitting energy is poorly represented in the local density
approximation. We also find good agreement with previous first principles
calculations and explain how differences in the calculated dispersion relations
can arise from subtle differences in computational approaches.

the reorientation of the magnetization is driven by the temperature induced

an increasing attention for their relevant technological applications in fields
ranging from biology, medicine, ecology, energy to industry. Most of the
performances of micro-nanostructured devices rely on both the design and the
intrinsic properties of the constituent materials that are processed at such
dimensional scale. For this reason, spatial precision, resolution and
reproducibility are crucial factors in the micro-fabrication procedure. 3D
direct laser lithography (DLL), based on multiphoton absorption, allows to
realize outstanding three-dimensional structures with nanoscale features. This
technique has recently emerged as a powerful tool for fabricating 3D
micro-patterned surfaces for optics, photonics, as well as for bioinspired cell
culture scaffold. We propose a method for a two-step fabrication of
micro/nanostructured multicomponent systems to be employed as transductors, by
means of the integration of 3D DLL and shadowing effects in metal deposition. A
z-axis accelerometer is the proof-of-concept for the validation of the proposed
transductor. The former is composed of a cantilever patterned with conductive
paths which act as a strain gauge. Mechanical stimulation deforms the
cantilever and, accordingly, varies its conductive properties. The fabrication
of the conductive components is performed using the vacuum evaporation of gold,
a traditional microfabrication technique, and exploiting the shadowing effect
due to peculiar microstructures on the cantilever.

component functor from the category FI of finite sets with injections to the

combinatorial model for these functors and use this model to prove that
Sym([n])-orbits of components of X_n, for all n, correspond bijectively to

and the evolving detector concepts for the experimental program at the
Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The EIC will be a powerful new high-luminosity
facility in the United States with the capability to collide high-energy
electron beams with high-energy proton and ion beams, providing access to those
regions in the nucleon and nuclei where their structure is dominated by gluons.
Moreover, polarized beams in the EIC will give unprecedented access to the
spatial and spin structure of the proton, neutron, and light ions. The studies
leading to this document were commissioned and organized by the EIC User Group
with the objective of advancing the state and detail of the physics program and
developing detector concepts that meet the emerging requirements in preparation
for the realization of the EIC. The effort aims to provide the basis for
further development of concepts for experimental equipment best suited for the
science needs, including the importance of two complementary detectors and
interaction regions.
  This report consists of three volumes. Volume I is an executive summary of
our findings and developed concepts. In Volume II we describe studies of a wide
range of physics measurements and the emerging requirements on detector
acceptance and performance. Volume III discusses general-purpose detector
concepts and the underlying technologies to meet the physics requirements.
These considerations will form the basis for a world-class experimental program
that aims to increase our understanding of the fundamental structure of all
visible matter

refers to transferring weather conditions of the image from one category to
another. It is important for photographic style transfer. Although lots of
approaches have been proposed in traditional image translation tasks, few of
them can handle the multi-category weather translation task, since weather
conditions have rich categories and highly complex semantic structures. To
address this problem, we develop a multi-domain weather translation approach
based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), denoted as Weather GAN, which
can achieve the transferring of weather conditions among sunny, cloudy, foggy,
rainy and snowy. Specifically, the weather conditions in the image are
determined by various weather-cues, such as cloud, blue sky, wet ground, etc.
Therefore, it is essential for weather translation to focus the main attention
on weather-cues. To this end, the generator of Weather GAN is composed of an
initial translation module, an attention module and a weather-cue segmentation
module. The initial translation module performs global translation during
generation procedure. The weather-cue segmentation module identifies the
structure and exact distribution of weather-cues. The attention module learns
to focus on the interesting areas of the image while keeping other areas
unaltered. The final generated result is synthesized by these three parts. This
approach suppresses the distortion and deformation caused by weather
translation. our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts has been shown by a
large number of experiments and evaluations.

paper is to use this combination in an efficient fashion to obtain mean and

shown how to formulate both chance-constraints and a probabilistic objective

verify the ability of the new approach to accurately approximate the

that it formed with a substantial H2 ice component in the starless core of a
giant molecular cloud. While interstellar solid hydrogen has yet to be
detected, this constituent would explain a number of the ISO's properties. We
consider the relevant processes required to build decameter-sized, solid
hydrogen bodies and assess the plausibility of growth in various size regimes.
Via an energy balance argument, we find that the most severe barrier to
formation is the extremely low temperature required for the favorability of
molecular hydrogen ice. However, if deposition occurs, we find that the
turbulence within starless cores is conducive for growth into kilometer-sized
bodies on sufficiently short timescales. Then, we analyze mass loss in the
interstellar medium and determine the necessary size for a hydrogen object to
survive a journey to the Solar System as a function of ISO age. Finally, we
discuss the implications if the H2 explanation is correct, and we assess the
future prospects of ISO science. If hydrogen ice ISOs do exist, our

different components, we combine the calculation of the overall free energy of
the glass with a calculation of the chemical potential difference of the two
components. We find that the standard method to compute chemical potential
differences by thermodynamic integration yields not only a wide scatter in the
chemical potential values but, more seriously, the average of the thermodynamic
integration results is well above the extrapolated value for the supercooled
liquid. However, we find that if we compute the difference of the chemical
potential of the components with the the non-equilibrium free energy expression
proposed by Jarzynski, we obtain a good match with the extrapolated value of
the supercooled liquid. The extension of the Jarzynski method that we propose
opens a potentially powerful route to compute free-energy related equilibrium
properties of glasses. We find that the solubility estimate of amorphous
materials obtained from direct coexistence simulations is only in fair
agreement with the solubility prediction based on the chemical potential
calculations of a hypothetical ""well-equilibrated glass"". In direct coexistence
simulations, we find that, in qualitative agreement with experiments, the

proclaims a set of frequent activities to assure the health of the software
product. Researchers and practitioners mention several benefits related to CI.
However, no systematic study surveys state of the art regarding such benefits
or cons. Objective: This study aims to identify and interpret empirical
evidence regarding how CI impacts software development. Method: Through a
Systematic Literature Review, we search for studies in six digital libraries.
Starting from 479 studies, we select 101 empirical studies that evaluate CI for
any software development activity (e.g., testing). We thoroughly read and
extract information regarding (i) CI environment, (ii) findings related to
effects of CI, and (iii) the employed methodology. We apply a thematic
synthesis to group and summarize the findings. Results: Existing research has
explored the positive effects of CI, such as better cooperation, or negative
effects, such as adding technical and process challenges. From our thematic
synthesis, we identify six themes: development activities, software process,
quality assurance, integration patterns, issues & defects, and build patterns.
Conclusions: Empirical research in CI has been increasing over recent years. We
found that much of the existing research reveals that CI brings positive
effects to the software development phenomena. However, CI may also bring
technical challenges to software development teams. Despite the overall
positive outlook regarding CI, we still find room for improvements in the
existing empirical research that evaluates the effects of CI.

  for the generation of dual-color X-rays",,,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose an innovative method to shift the transversal position of the
focal point of an optical cavity keeping it actively stabilized. Our cavity is
a 4 mirrors bow-tie cavity and the spatial shift of the resonant mode is
obtained by properly rotating the two curved mirrors by piezo actuators. This
method allows us to move the transversal position of the cavity focal point of
$135 \mu m$ in a time of $50 ms$, keeping the resonance condition of the cavity
by means of the Pound-Drever-Hall technique. We propose to use this technique
for the generation of 2-color X-rays via Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS). This
technique exploits the large average power stored in the high finesse cavity by
shifting the laser beam with respect to the electron beam trajectory, hence
controlling the spatial superposition of the electron and photon beams in the
interaction region. Arranging two cavities assembled one on top of the other,
with different collision angle with the electron beam, allows the generation of
X-ray bursts of different energies just by swiftly moving the two cavities,
switching the two focal points onto the electron beam trajectory, thus
activating in sequence two different ICS spectral lines.

three samples of a triplet (anchor, positive, and negative), we introduce a
fourth term - a partial - to define a differential margin based partialorder

the overlap zone between the positives and the negatives, thereby resulting in
broader embedding coverage. Our proposals consistently outperform the

training segmentation models. These proposal generators, however, are generic
and not specifically designed for box-supervised semantic segmentation, thereby
leaving some leeway for improving segmentation performance. In this paper, we
aim at seeking for a more accurate learning-based class-agnostic pseudo mask
generator tailored to box-supervised semantic segmentation. To this end, we
resort to a pixel-level annotated auxiliary dataset where the class labels are
non-overlapped with those of the box-annotated dataset. For learning pseudo
mask generator from the auxiliary dataset, we present a bi-level optimization
formulation. In particular, the lower subproblem is used to learn
box-supervised semantic segmentation, while the upper subproblem is used to
learn an optimal class-agnostic pseudo mask generator. The learned pseudo
segmentation mask generator can then be deployed to the box-annotated dataset
for improving weakly supervised semantic segmentation. Experiments on PASCAL
VOC 2012 dataset show that the learned pseudo mask generator is effective in
boosting segmentation performance, and our method can further close the

of stellar evolution theory, but the anisotropy of the transport due to the
stable stratification and the rotation of these regions is poorly understood.
The assumption of shellular rotation, which is a cornerstone of the so-called
rotational mixing, relies on an efficient horizontal transport. However, this
transport is included in many stellar evolution codes through phenomenological
models that have never been tested.
  Aims. We investigate the impact of horizontal shear on the anisotropy of
turbulent transport.
  Methods. We used a relaxation approximation (also known as {\tau}
approximation) to describe the anisotropising effect of stratification,
rotation, and shear on a background turbulent flow by computing velocity
correlations.
  Results. We obtain new theoretical scalings for velocity correlations that
include the effect of horizontal shear. These scalings show an enhancement of
turbulent motions, which would lead to a more efficient transport of chemicals
and angular momentum, in better agreement with helio- and asteroseismic
observations of rotation in the whole Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Moreover, we
propose a new choice for the non-linear time used in the relaxation
approximation, which characterises the source of the turbulence.
  Conclusions. For the first time, we describe the effect of stratification,
rotation, and vertical and horizontal shear on the anisotropy of turbulent
transport in stellar radiative zones. The new prescriptions need to be
implemented in stellar evolution calculations. To do so, it may be necessary to
implement non-diffusive transport.

instructed to repeat the last words of all sentences from that talker, until

is implemented with an adjustable overlap time that causes an overlap between
the call sign ""Kerstin"" and the target words to be repeated. Thus, the two
tasks of detecting ""Kerstin"" and repeating target words are to be processed at

Results for these overlap times show significant differences with median target

replace the gradient of the objective function with some noisy gradient
estimator that can be computed from a small number of function evaluations.
This estimator is constructed randomly, and its expectation matches the
gradient of a smooth approximation of the objective function whose quality
improves as the underlying smoothing parameter $\delta$ is reduced. Gradient
estimators requiring a smaller number of function evaluations are preferable
from a computational point of view. While estimators based on a single function
evaluation can be obtained by a clever use of the divergence theorem from
vector calculus, their variance explodes as $\delta$ tends to $0$. Estimators
based on multiple function evaluations, on the other hand, suffer from
numerical cancellation when $\delta$ tends to $0$. To combat both effects
simultaneously, we extend the objective function to the complex domain and
construct a gradient estimator that evaluates the objective at a complex point
whose coordinates have small imaginary parts of the order $\delta$. As this
estimator requires only one function evaluation, it is immune to cancellation.
In addition, its variance remains bounded as $\delta$ tends to $0$. We prove
that zeroth-order algorithms that use our estimator offer the same theoretical
convergence guarantees as the state-of-the-art methods. Numerical experiments

skip examinations, to compare the difficulty levels of these examinations. We
call the resultant data 'selectively omitted examination data' Examples of this
type of examination are university entrance examinations, certification
examinations, and the outcome of students' job-hunting activities. We can learn
the number of students accepted for each examination and organization but not
the examinees' identity. No research has focused on this type of data. When we
know the difficulty level of these examinations, we can obtain a new index to
assess organization ability, how many students pass, and the difficulty of the
examinations. This index would reflect the outcomes of their education
corresponding to perspectives on examinations. Therefore, we propose a novel
method, Peak Shift Estimation, to estimate the difficulty level of an
examination based on selectively omitted examination data. First, we apply Peak
Shift Estimation to the simulation data and demonstrate that Peak Shift
Estimation estimates the rank order of the difficulty level of university
entrance examinations very robustly. Peak Shift Estimation is also suitable for
estimating a multi-level scale for universities, that is, A, B, C, and D rank
university entrance examinations. We apply Peak Shift Estimation to real data
of the Tokyo metropolitan area and demonstrate that the rank correlation
coefficient between difficulty level ranking and true ranking is 0.844 and that
the difference between 80 percent of universities is within 25 ranks. The
accuracy of Peak Shift Estimation is thus low and must be improved; however,

opposite directions based on Hermitian physics. The non-Hermitian skin effect
causes the localization of a large number of modes of a system at its edges.
Here we propose a system based on exciton-polariton elliptical micropillars
hosting both the effects. The polarization splitting of the elliptical
micropillars gives rise to the topological spin-Hall effect in a one
dimensional lattice. When a circularly polarized external incoherent laser is
used to imbalance effective decay rates of the different spin polarizations,
the system transits to a non-Hermitian regime showing the skin effect. These
effects have implications for robust polariton transport as well as the
deterministic formation of multiply charged vortices and persistent currents.

Particularly interesting questions pertain to the nature and extent of

alloys to unconventional superconductors, and how this microstructure affects
macroscopic properties. Here we use neutron and X-ray diffuse scattering to
uncover universal structural fluctuations in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and
Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$, two cuprate superconductors with distinct point
disorder effects and optimal superconducting transition temperatures. The
fluctuations are present in wide doping and temperature ranges, including
compositions that maintain high average structural symmetry, and they exhibit
unusual, yet simple scaling behavior. The scaling regime is robust and
universal, similar to the well-known critical fluctuations close to
second-order phase transitions, but with a distinctly different physical
origin. We relate this behavior to pre-transitional phenomena in a broad class
of systems with structural and magnetic transitions, and propose an explanation
based on rare structural fluctuations caused by intrinsic nanoscale
inhomogeneity. We also uncover parallels with superconducting fluctuations,
which indicates that the underlying inhomogeneity plays an important role in
cuprate physics.

significance of contrastive learning, which leads to suboptimal performance. In
this paper, we present a novel Doubly Contrastive Deep Clustering (DCDC)
framework, which constructs contrastive loss over both sample and class views
to obtain more discriminative features and competitive results. Specifically,
for the sample view, we set the class distribution of the original sample and
its augmented version as positive sample pairs and set one of the other
augmented samples as negative sample pairs. After that, we can adopt the
sample-wise contrastive loss to pull positive sample pairs together and push
negative sample pairs apart. Similarly, for the class view, we build the
positive and negative pairs from the sample distribution of the class. In this
way, two contrastive losses successfully constrain the clustering results of
mini-batch samples in both sample and class level. Extensive experimental
results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
model against state-of-the-art methods. Particularly in the challenging dataset

for assigning experimentally measured frequencies to the corresponding type of
molecular motions is computationally challenging at sufficiently high levels of
quantum chemical theory. Here, a practical and affordable way to calculate
coupled-cluster quality anharmonic frequencies using second order vibrational
perturbation theory (VPT2) from machine-learned models is presented. The
approach, referred to as ""NN + VPT2"", uses a high-dimensional neural network
(PhysNet) to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) at different levels of
theory from which harmonic and VPT2 frequencies can be efficiently determined.
The NN + VPT2 approach is applied to eight small to medium sized molecules
(H$_2$CO, trans-HONO, HCOOH, CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$NO$_2$, CH$_3$COOH and
CH$_3$CONH$_2$) and frequencies are reported from NN-learned models at the
MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 levels of
theory. For the largest molecules and at the highest levels of theory, transfer
learning (TL) is used to determine the necessary full-dimensional,
near-equilibrium PESs. Overall, NN + VPT2 yields anharmonic frequencies to
within 20 cm$^{-1}$ of experimentally determined frequencies for close to 90 %
of the modes for the highest quality PES available and to within 10 cm$^{-1}$
for more than 60 % of the modes. For the MP2 PESs only around 60 % of the NN +
VPT2 frequencies were within 20~cm$^{-1}$ of the experiment, with outliers up
to 150 cm$^{-1}$ compared with experiment. It is also demonstrated that the
approach allows to provide correct assignments for strongly interacting modes
such as the OH bending and the OH torsional modes in formic acid monomer and
the CO-stretch and OH-bend mode in acetic acid.

angular power spectrum at each receiver location are used to study spatial
autocorrelation properties of various channel parameters such as shadow fading,
delay spread, and angular spread along the track. Compared to the correlation
distances reported in the 3GPP TR 38.901 for frequencies below 100 GHz, the
measured correlation distance of shadow fading at 142 GHz (3.8 m) is much
shorter than the 10-13 m as specified in 3GPP; the measured correlation
distances of delay spread and angular spread at 142 GHz (both 12 m) are

relaxation. The QCQP based classical optimization was recently introduced as
the classical step in quantum assisted eigensolver (QAE), a NISQ algorithm for
the Hamiltonian ground state problem. Thus, our work provides a conceptual
unification between the NISQ algorithms for the Hamiltonian ground state
problem and the Hamiltonian simulation. We recover differential equation-based
NISQ algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation such as quantum assisted simulator
(QAS) and variational quantum simulator (VQS) as particular cases of our

Suzuki-Trotter expansion on basic single- and two-qubit quantum gates using

the Trotter error and the adiabatic condition are less restrictive even for
modest values of Trotter time steps. We reach an optimum fidelity $>99\%$ on

in particular regarding the star and planet formation process. In this context,
discs subject to an idealized cooling process, characterized by a cooling
timescale $\beta$ expressed in unit of orbital timescale, have been extensively
studied. We take advantage of the Riemann solver and the 3D Godunov scheme
implemented in the code Ramses to perform high resolution simulations,
complementing previous studies that have used smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) or 2D grid codes. We observe that the critical value of $\beta$ for which
the disc fragments is consistent with most previous results, and is not well
converged with resolution. By studying the probability density function of the
fluctuations of the column density ($\Sigma$-PDF), we argue that there is no
strict separation between the fragmented and the unfragmented regimes but
rather a smooth transition with the probability of apparition of fragments
steadily diminishing as the cooling becames less effective. We find that the
high column density part of the $\Sigma$-PDF follows a simple power law whose
slope turns out to be proportional to $\beta$ and we propose an explanation
based on the balance between cooling and heating through gravitational stress.
Our explanation suggests that a more efficient cooling requires more heating
implying a larger fraction of dense material which, in the absence of
characteristic scales, results in a shallower scale-free power law. We propose
that the gravitational cascade proceeds in two steps, first the formation of a
dense filamentary spiral pattern through a sequence of quasi-static equilibrium
triggered by the viscous transport of angular momentum, and second the collapse
alongside these filaments that eventually results in the formation of bounded
fragments.

is defined between the Helmholtz free energy and the equilibrium site

independent from the size of the system under investigation and can be
constructed over exact data for small systems. These 'exact' functionals are
numerically defined by neural networks. We also define additional neural
networks for finite-temperature thermodynamical quantities, such as the entropy
and heat capacity. These can be either a functional of the ground-state site

in Polynesia. Radioactive fallout impacted downwind atolls and islands leading
to the external and internal exposure of the local populations to ionizing
radiation. By law, individuals who were exposed to radiation in the context of
these tests can file compensation claims with the French government if they
develop certain radiogenic cancers. A claimant who meets the basic eligibility
criteria (place, time, and type of disease) automatically benefits from the
presumption of a causal link between radiation exposure and the development of
their illness, unless the exposure is deemed too low. Since 2017, an effective
dose threshold of 1 mSv per year has been used in the claims adjudication
process. Decisions as to whether claimants have met this 1 mSv threshold in a
given year are often made on the basis of data from government dose
reconstruction studies carried out in 2005 and 2006. Using new information
available from recently declassified documents on the radiological impact of
French atmospheric nuclear tests in Polynesia, as well as atmospheric transport
modeling of radioactive fallout, this article shows that maximum doses to the
public for key atmospheric tests may have been underestimated by factors of 2
to 10 and estimates that the total population exposed above the compensation
threshold of 1 mSv/yr could be greater than ~110,000. This latter result
corresponds to about 90% of the entire population of French Polynesia at the
time of the atmospheric tests. Integrating these updated dose estimates into
the claim adjudication process would enlarge the pool of eligible claimants by
a factor of 10. Also discussed are the legal and policy implications of these

The computational cost of the method is discussed, along with an analysis of
compression techniques capable of significantly reducing computational cost for
partially loaded systems. Several numerical examples demonstrate the
capabilities of the technique along with its validation against conventional
methods of modeling time-varying electromagnetic systems, such as finite
difference time domain and transient circuit co-simulation.

scaleups, need to be creative at how they approach performance appraisals.
  In this talk, we introduce automated review dashboards to support a seamless

The proposed dashboards leverage structure from existing growth frameworks
while automating the aggregation of relevant qualitative and quantitative
performance metrics.
  We reflect on our experience using the dashboards at Robusta, a medium-sized

provide timely feedback to 56 engineers with a base for continuous visibility.
We explore the design of the dashboards, the customizable metrics and the

patterns, from individual species to communities of species, is critical for
mitigating effects of global change. A central goal for conservation planning
and monitoring is the ability to accurately predict the occurrence of species
communities and how these communities change over space and time. This in turn
leads to a challenging and long-standing problem in the field of computer
science - how to perform ac-curate multi-label classification with hundreds of
labels? The key challenge of this problem is its exponential-sized output space
with regards to the number of labels to be predicted.Therefore, it is essential
to facilitate the learning process by exploiting correlations (or dependency)
among labels. Previous methods mostly focus on modelling the correlation on
label pairs; however, complex relations between real-world objects often go
beyond second order. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel framework for
multi-label classification, High-order Tie-in Variational Autoencoder
(HOT-VAE), which per-forms adaptive high-order label correlation learning. We
experimentally verify that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art
approaches on a bird distribution dataset on both conventional F1 scores and a
variety of ecological metrics. To show our method is general, we also perform
empirical analysis on seven other public real-world datasets in several
application domains, and Hot-VAE exhibits superior performance to previous
methods.

Nowadays a data center usually equips with a cluster of heterogeneous computing
servers which are different in the hardware/software configuration. From both
the cost saving and environmental friendliness, the data centers could benefit
a lot from optimizing the job scheduling problems in the heterogeneous
environment. Thus the problem has attracted more and more attention from both
the industry and academy. In this paper, we propose a task-duplication based

dependencies between jobs using a reinforcement learning framework and a
specially designed graph neural network (GNN) to select the most promising task
to be executed. Then the task is assigned to a specific executor with the
consideration of duplicating all its precedent tasks according to an
expert-designed rules. We have conducted extensive experiments over standard

that \lachesisquad can achieve at most 26.7\% reduction of makespan and 35.2\%
improvement of speedup ratio over seven strong baseline algorithms, including
the state-of-the-art heuristics methods and a variety of deep reinforcement

Second, we categorise extracted ""no-deal"" effects using a Structural Topic

partisan user factions. We hence type topics using estimated covariate effects

the ""no-deal"" Brexit debate is shown to have an assortative argumentation

  Methods: Cardiac MR image reconstruction is modeled as general compressed

manifold is designed to characterize the temporal correlation of dynamic
signals. Iterative procedures can be obtained by solving the optimization model
on the manifold, including gradient calculation, projection of the gradient to
tangent space, and retraction of the tangent space to the manifold. The
iterative procedures on the manifold are unrolled to a neural network, dubbed

highly-integrated portable ECT device is developed, which takes advantage of an
advanced field programmable gate array (Zynq-7020 system on chip) and provides
fast data acquisition and in-phase/quadrature demodulation. Secondly, a
dataset, termed as MDDECT, is constructed using the ECT device by human
operators and made openly available. It contains 48,000 scans from 18 defects
of different depths and lift-offs. Thirdly, the depth evaluation problem is
formulated as a time series classification problem, and various
state-of-the-art 1-d residual convolutional neural networks are trained and
evaluated on the MDDECT dataset. A 38-layer 1-d ResNeXt achieves an accuracy of
93.58% in discriminating the surface defects in a stainless steel sheet. The
depths of the defects vary from 0.3 mm to 2.0 mm in a resolution of 0.1 mm. In
addition, results show that the trained ResNeXt1D-38 model is immune to
lift-off signals.

  problems",,,"10.1016/j.patrec.2021.02.014",,"cs.DM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Error-tolerant graph matching gathers an important family of problems. These
problems aim at finding correspondences between two graphs while integrating an
error model. In the Graph Edit Distance (GED) problem, the insertion/deletion
of edges/nodes from one graph to another is explicitly expressed by the error
model. At the opposite, the problem commonly referred to as ""graph matching""
does not explicitly express such operations. For decades, these two problems
have split the research community in two separated parts. It resulted in the
design of different solvers for the two problems. In this paper, we propose a
unification of both problems thanks to a single model. We give the proof that
the two problems are equivalent under a reformulation of the error models. This
unification makes possible the use on both problems of existing solving methods
from the two communities.

charge is always directed away from, or points towards, the instantaneous
present position of the charge and not away from, or towards, the retarded
position at which the observer sees it (due to the finite speed of light). This
fact is a well-established consequence of, among others, the application of the
Li\'enard-Wiechert potentials, and its significance for fundamental physics is
probably not fully appreciated. Here we show how and why this property has
non-negligible consequences for what we take for granted about the relativity
of simultaneity and faster-than-light communication. In particular, if we
consider two opposite electric charges whose distance shrinks to zero at a
constant velocity (shrinking electric dipole), then the cancellation of the
total field seems to be instantaneous everywhere in space and in every inertial
reference frame. A simple variant of the shrinking electric dipole setup
appears to allow a sort of faster-than-light communication of information. Our
results provide simple theoretical support to the conclusions of recent
experiments on the propagation speed of Coulomb and magnetic fields. It would
also be interesting to explore any possible connection between our findings and
quantum non-locality.

that will always give rise to the structure of Hilbert space of quantum
mechanics, in any finite outcome space, is presented and the guidelines to how
to extend this work to infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces are given. Moreover,
this new formulation which will be called as extended operational probabilistic
theories, applies not only to quantum systems, but also equally well to
classical systems, without violating Bell's theorem, and at the same time
solves the measurement problem. A new answer to the question of why our
universe is quantum mechanical rather than classical will be presented.
Besides, this extended probability theory shows that it is non determinacy, or
to be more precise, the non deterministic description of the universe, that
makes the laws of physics the way they are. In addition, this paper shows that
there is still a possibility that there might be a deterministic level from
which our universe emerges, which if understood correctly, may open the door
wide to applications in areas such as quantum computing. In addition, this
paper explains the deep reason why complex Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics
are needed.
