areas, ranging from market operation to people's daily lives. In economics, the
term matching theory is coined for pairing two agents in a specific market to
reach a stable or optimal state. In computer science, all branches of matching
problems have emerged, such as the question-answer matching in information
retrieval, user-item matching in a recommender system, and entity-relation
matching in the knowledge graph. A preference list is the core element during a
matching process, which can either be obtained directly from the agents or
generated indirectly by prediction. Based on the preference list access,
matching problems are divided into two categories, i.e., explicit matching and
implicit matching. In this paper, we first introduce the matching theory's
basic models and algorithms in explicit matching. The existing methods for
coping with various matching problems in implicit matching are reviewed, such
as retrieval matching, user-item matching, entity-relation matching, and image
matching. Furthermore, we look into representative applications in these areas,
including marriage and labor markets in explicit matching and several
similarity-based matching problems in implicit matching. Finally, this survey
paper concludes with a discussion of open issues and promising future
directions in the field of matching.

GES, GIES, and MMHC algorithms. In 2010, Studen\'y, Hemmecke and Lindner
introduced the characteristic imset polytope, $\operatorname{CIM}_p$, whose
vertices correspond to Markov equivalence classes, as a way of transforming
causal discovery into a linear optimization problem. We show that the moves of
the aforementioned algorithms are included within classes of edges of
$\operatorname{CIM}_p$ and that restrictions placed on the skeleton of the
candidate DAGs correspond to faces of $\operatorname{CIM}_p$. Thus, we observe
that GES, GIES, and MMHC all have geometric realizations as greedy edge-walks
along $\operatorname{CIM}_p$. Furthermore, the identified edges of
$\operatorname{CIM}_p$ strictly generalize the moves of these algorithms.
Exploiting this generalization, we introduce a greedy simplex-type algorithm

that outperforms current competitors among hybrid and constraint-based

experimental and theoretical works exploring nanoscale heat transport in

including effective parameters, such as a size-dependent thermal conductivity.
However, recent experiments have qualitatively shown new behavior that cannot
be modeled in this way. Here, we combine advanced experiment and theory to show
that the cooling of 1D- and 2D-confined nanoscale hot spots on silicon can be
described using a general hydrodynamic heat transport model, contrary to
previous understanding of heat flow in bulk silicon. We use a comprehensive set
of extreme ultraviolet scatterometry measurements of non-diffusive transport
from transiently heated nanolines and nanodots to validate and generalize our
ab initio model, that does not need any geometry-dependent fitting parameters.
This allows us to uncover the existence of two distinct timescales and heat
transport mechanisms: an interface resistance regime that dominates on short
time scales, and a hydrodynamic-like phonon transport regime that dominates on
longer timescales. Moreover, our model can predict the full thermomechanical
response on nanometer length scales and picosecond time scales for arbitrary
geometries, providing an advanced practical tool for thermal management of
nanoscale technologies. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the
transport timescales, valid for a subset of geometries, supplying a route for
optimizing heat dissipation.

enhancing turbulence and mixing in the interior ocean when they break. Inviscid
linear theory is generally used to predict the generation rate of lee waves,

linear model with viscosity, diffusivity, and an upper boundary is used to
demonstrate the potential importance of the surface in reflecting lee wave

growing rapidly in the last decades, due to new technologies and dedicated
survey telescopes. Besides dealing with poly-structured and complex data,
sparse data has become a field of growing scientific interest. A specific field
of Astroinformatics research is the estimation of redshifts of extra-galactic
sources by using sparse photometric observations. Many techniques have been
developed to produce those estimates with increasing precision. In recent
years, models have been favored which instead of providing a point estimate
only, are able to generate probabilistic density functions (PDFs) in order to
characterize and quantify the uncertainties of their estimates.
  Crucial to the development of those models is a proper, mathematically
principled way to evaluate and characterize their performances, based on
scoring functions as well as on tools for assessing calibration. Still, in
literature inappropriate methods are being used to express the quality of the
estimates that are often not sufficient and can potentially generate misleading
interpretations. In this work we summarize how to correctly evaluate errors and
forecast quality when dealing with PDFs. We describe the use of the
log-likelihood, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the
probability integral transform (PIT) to characterize the calibration as well as
the sharpness of predicted PDFs. We present what we achieved when using proper
scoring rules to train deep neural networks as well as to evaluate the model
estimates and how this work led from well calibrated redshift estimates to
improvements in probabilistic weather forecasting. The presented work is an
example of interdisciplinarity in data-science and illustrates how methods can
help to bridge gaps between different fields of application.

Given that specific annotated imaging modalities may not be accessible nor
complete. Our proposed solution is based on the cross-modality synthesis of
medical images to reduce the costly annotation burden by radiologists and
bridge the domain gap in radiological images. We present a novel approach for
image-to-image translation in medical images, capable of supervised or
unsupervised (unpaired image data) setups. Built upon adversarial training, we
propose a learnable self-attentive spatial normalization of the deep
convolutional generator network's intermediate activations. Unlike previous
attention-based image-to-image translation approaches, which are either
domain-specific or require distortion of the source domain's structures, we
unearth the importance of the auxiliary semantic information to handle the
geometric changes and preserve anatomical structures during image translation.
We achieve superior results for cross-modality segmentation between unpaired

and black holes (BHs) in the low and high-end mass gap regimes pose a puzzle to
standard stellar and binary evolution theory. Mass-gap mergers may originate
from successive mergers in hierarchical systems such as quadruples. Here, we
consider repeated mergers of NSs and BHs in stellar 2+2 quadruple systems, in
which secular evolution can accelerate the merger of one of the inner binaries.
Subsequently, the merger remnant may interact with the companion binary,
yielding a second-generation merger. We model the initial stellar and binary
evolution of the inner binaries as isolated systems. In the case of successful
compact object formation, we subsequently follow the secular dynamical
evolution of the quadruple system. When a merger occurs, we take into account
merger recoil, and model subsequent evolution using direct N-body integration.
With different assumptions on the initial properties, we find that the majority
of first-generation mergers are not much affected by secular evolution, with
their observational properties mostly consistent with isolated binaries. A
small subset shows imprints of secular evolution through residual eccentricity
in the LIGO band, and retrograde spin-orbit orientations. Second-generation
mergers are ~10^7 times less common than first-generation mergers, and can be
strongly affected by scattering (i.e., three-body interactions) induced by the
first-generation merger. In particular, scattering can account for mergers
within the low-end mass gap, although not the high-end mass gap. Also, in a few
cases, scattering could explain highly eccentric LIGO sources and negative
effective spin parameters.

vital step towards safe deployment of such tools is to ensure that the models
not only produce accurate predictions but also do not generalize to data
regimes where the training data provide no meaningful evidence. Existing
approaches for ensuring the distribution of model predictions to be similar to
that of the true distribution rely on explicit uncertainty estimators that are
inherently hard to calibrate. In this paper, we propose to train a loss
estimator alongside the predictive model, using a contrastive training
objective, to directly estimate the prediction uncertainties. Interestingly, we
find that, in addition to producing well-calibrated uncertainties, this
approach improves the generalization behavior of the predictor. Using a
dermatology use-case, we show the impact of loss estimators on model
generalization, in terms of both its fidelity on in-distribution data and its
ability to detect out of distribution samples or new classes unseen during

the faster differential rotation in the deeper layer. In this study, we perform

virus-induced degeneration can play a role in the signal power and spiking rate
and the probability of releasing neurotransmitters and compromising the
propagation and processing of information between the neurons. We also propose
a transfer function that models these attenuation effects that degenerates the
action potential, where this model has the potential to be used as a framework
for the analysis of virus-induced neurodegeneration that can pave the way to
improved understanding of virus-induced demyelination.

execute the computed motion only if a collision-free and torque-limited way to
continue the trajectory is known. In practice, the motion computed for the
current time interval is extended by a braking trajectory and simulated using a
physics engine. If the simulated trajectory complies with all safety
constraints, the computed motion is carried out. Otherwise, the braking
trajectory calculated in the previous time interval serves as an alternative
safe behavior. Given a task-specific reward function, the neural network is
trained using reinforcement learning. The design of the action space used for
reinforcement learning ensures that all computed trajectories comply with
kinematic joint limits. For our evaluation, simulated humanoid robots and
industrial robots are trained to reach as many randomly placed target points as

Hence design of effective organic thermoelectric materials requires
understanding the Lorenz number. Here, analytical modeling and kinetic Monte

length scales on the correlation of electrical and thermal conductivity in
organic semiconductor thermoelectrics. We show that a Lorenz factor up to a

$m$-sparse $d$-dimensional signal $x$ is to be recovered from $n$ linear
measurements with a given algorithm. Suppose that the measurements are such
that the algorithm does not guarantee perfect support recovery and that true
features may be missed. Can they efficiently be retrieved? This paper addresses
this question through a simple error-correction module referred to as LiRE.
LiRE takes as input an estimate $s_{in}$ of the true support $s^*$, and outputs
a refined support estimate $s_{out}$. In the noiseless measurement setup,
sufficient conditions are established under which LiRE is guaranteed to recover
the entire support, that is $s_{out}$ contains $s^*$. These conditions imply,
for instance, that in the high-dimensional regime LiRE can correct a sublinear
in $m$ number of errors made by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The
computational complexity of LiRE is $O(mnd)$. Experimental results with random
Gaussian design matrices show that LiRE substantially reduces the number of
measurements needed for perfect support recovery via Compressive Sampling
Matching Pursuit, Basis Pursuit (BP), and OMP. Interestingly, adding LiRE to
OMP yields a support recovery procedure that is more accurate and significantly
faster than BP. This observation carries over in the noisy measurement setup.
Finally, as a standalone support recovery algorithm with a random
initialization, experiments show that LiRE's reconstruction performance lies
between OMP and BP. These results suggest that LiRE may be used generically, on
top of any suboptimal baseline support recovery algorithm, to improve support
recovery or to operate with a smaller number of measurements, at the cost of a
relatively small computational overhead. Alternatively, LiRE may be used as a
standalone support recovery algorithm that is competitive with respect to OMP.

deformation: twist, bend, splay, and a fourth mode related to saddle-splay.
Each mode is coupled to a specific type of molecular order: chirality,
polarization perpendicular and parallel to the director, and octupolar order.
When the liquid crystal develops one type of spontaneous order, the ideal local
structure becomes nonuniform, with the corresponding director deformation. In
general, the ideal local structure is frustrated; it cannot fill space. As a
result, the liquid crystal must form a complex global phase, which may have a
combination of deformation modes, and may have a periodic array of defects.
Thus, the concept of an ideal local structure under geometric frustration
provides a unified framework to understand the wide variety of modulated

signal-to-noise ratios in the range 4.6-12.3 sigma. We derive a column density
of 8.7e13 cm-2 for CH2CCH, which translates to a fractional abundance relative
to H2 of 8.7e-9. This radical has a similar abundance to methyl acetylene, with
an abundance ratio CH2CCH/CH3CCH close to one. The propargyl radical is thus
one of the most abundant radicals detected in TMC-1, and it is probably the
most abundant organic radical with a certain chemical complexity ever found in
a cold dark cloud. We constructed a gas-phase chemical model and find
calculated abundances that agree with, or fall two orders of magnitude below,
the observed value depending on the poorly constrained low-temperature
reactivity of CH2CCH with neutral atoms. According to the chemical model, the
propargyl radical is essentially formed by the C + C2H4 reaction and by the
dissociative recombination of C3Hn+ ions with n = 4-6. The propargyl radical is
believed to control the synthesis of the first aromatic ring in combustion
processes, and it probably plays a key role in the synthesis of large organic
molecules and cyclization processes to benzene in cold dark clouds.

closed-loop system degrades over time due to the change of plant
characteristics. Thus, there is a strong need for redesigning a controller
without going through the system modeling process, which is often difficult for
closed-loop systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the promising
approaches that enable model-free redesign of optimal controllers for nonlinear
dynamical systems based only on the measurement of the closed-loop system.
However, the learning process of RL usually requires a considerable number of
trial-and-error experiments using the poorly controlled system that may
accumulate wear on the plant. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
model-free two-step design approach that improves the transient learning
performance of RL in an optimal regulator redesign problem for unknown
nonlinear systems. Specifically, we first design a linear control law that
attains some degree of control performance in a model-free manner, and then,
train the nonlinear optimal control law with online RL by using the designed
linear control law in parallel. We introduce an offline RL algorithm for the
design of the linear control law and theoretically guarantee its convergence to
the LQR controller under mild assumptions. Numerical simulations show that the

in astrochemistry as it regulates the abundance of the hydroxyl radical and
serves to open the chemistry of oxygen in diverse astronomical environments.
However, the existence of a high activation barrier in the reaction with ground
state oxygen atoms limits its efficiency in cold gas. In this study we
calculate the dependence of the reaction rate coefficient on the rotational and
vibrational state of H$_2$ and evaluate the impact on the abundance of OH in
interstellar regions strongly irradiated by far-UV photons, where H2 can be
efficiently pumped to excited vibrational states. We use a recently calculated
potential energy surface and carry out time-independent quantum mechanical
scattering calculations to compute rate coefficients for the reaction O(3P) +
H2(v,j) -> OH + H, with H2 in vibrational states v = 0-7 and rotational states
j = 0-10. We find that the reaction becomes significantly faster with
increasing vibrational quantum number of H2, although even for high vibrational
states of H2 (v = 4-5) for which the reaction is barrierless, the rate
coefficient does not strictly attain the collision limit and still maintains a
positive dependence with temperature. We implemented the calculated
state-specific rate coefficients in the Meudon PDR code to model the Orion Bar
PDR and evaluate the impact on the abundance of the OH radical. We find the
fractional abundance of OH is enhanced by up to one order of magnitude in
regions of the cloud corresponding to Av = 1.3-2.3, compared to the use of a
thermal rate coefficient for O + H2, although the impact on the column density
of OH is modest, of about 60 %. The calculated rate coefficients will be useful
to model and interpret JWST observations of OH in strongly UV-illuminated
environments.

1) an analog to meteoritic insoluble organic matter and 2) a powdered Allende

predicting the pose and orientation of the agents in the scene. This represents
a particularly useful problem, for instance in autonomous driving, but it does
not cover a spectrum of applications in control and simulation that require
information on vehicle dynamics features other than pose and orientation. Also,
multi-step dynamic simulation of complex multibody models does not seem to be a
viable solution for real-time long-term prediction, due to the high
computational time required. To bridge this gap, we present a deep-learning
framework to model and predict the evolution of the coupled driver-vehicle
system dynamics jointly on a complex road geometry. It consists of two
components. The first, a neural network predictor, is based on Long Short-Term
Memory autoencoders and fuses the information on the road geometry and the past
driver-vehicle system dynamics to produce context-aware predictions. The
second, a Bayesian optimiser, is proposed to tune some significant
hyperparameters of the network. These govern the network complexity, as well as
the features importance. The result is a self-tunable framework with real-time
applicability, which allows the user to specify the features of interest. The
approach has been validated with a case study centered on motion cueing
algorithms, using a dataset collected during test sessions of a
non-professional driver on a dynamic driving simulator. A 3D track with complex
geometry has been employed as driving environment to render the prediction task
challenging. Finally, the robustness of the neural network to changes in the
driver and track was investigated to set guidelines for future works.

difference (DGD) discretizations for hyperbolic conservation laws on

entropy-stable summation-by-parts (SBP) discretizations. In particular, the
paper shows how DGD discretizations -- both linear and nonlinear -- can be
constructed by defining the SBP trial and test functions in terms of
interpolated DGD degrees of freedom. In the case of entropy-stable
discretizations, the entropy variables rather than the conservative variables
must be interpolated to the SBP nodes. A fully-discrete entropy-stable scheme
is obtained by adopting the relaxation Runge-Kutta version of the midpoint
method. In addition, DGD matrix operators for the first derivative are shown to
be dense-norm SBP operators. Numerical results are presented to verify the
accuracy and entropy-stability of the DGD discretization in the context of the
Euler equations. The results suggest that DGD and SBP solution errors are
similar for the same number of degrees of freedom. Finally, an investigation of
the DGD spectra shows that spectral radius is relatively insensitive to
discretization order; however, the high-order methods do suffer from the linear
instability reported for other entropy-stable discretizations.

yield, in general, to difficult and non-convex optimization tasks. A number of
standard methods are used to tackle such problems: variational approaches focus
on parameterizing a subclass of solutions within the feasible set; in contrast,
relaxation techniques have been proposed to approximate it from outside, thus
complementing the variational approach by providing ultimate bounds to the
global optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel approach combining
the power of relaxation techniques with deep reinforcement learning in order to
find the best possible bounds within a limited computational budget. We
illustrate the viability of the method in the context of finding the ground

algorithms such as breadth-first search or Monte-Carlo, and we characterize the
effect of transfer learning. We find the latter may be indicative of phase

dependence of the long-lived states map onto a near-direct band gap ($E{_g}$)
density of states with an Urbach tail below $E{_g}$. As temperature increases,
the long-lived decay times increase $<E{_g}$, due to the increased phonon
interaction of the unintentional defect states, and by phonon stabilization of
the hot carriers $>E{_g}$. Additionally, Auger (and/or trap-assisted Auger)
scattering above the onset of the plateau may also contribute to longer
hot-carrier lifetimes. Meanwhile, the initial decay component shows strong
dependence on excitation energy and temperature, reflecting the complicated
initial transfer of energy between valence-band and defect states, indicating
methods to further prolong hot carriers for technological applications.

brain structure and function caused by aging or neurological diseases.
Analyzing this data via machine learning generally requires a large number of
ground-truth labels, which are often missing or expensive to obtain. Reducing
the need for labels, we propose a self-supervised strategy for representation
learning named Longitudinal Neighborhood Embedding (LNE). Motivated by concepts
in contrastive learning, LNE explicitly models the similarity between
trajectory vectors across different subjects. We do so by building a graph in
each training iteration defining neighborhoods in the latent space so that the
progression direction of a subject follows the direction of its neighbors. This
results in a smooth trajectory field that captures the global morphological
change of the brain while maintaining the local continuity. We apply LNE to
longitudinal T1w MRIs of two neuroimaging studies: a dataset composed of 274
healthy subjects, and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI,
N=632). The visualization of the smooth trajectory vector field and superior
performance on downstream tasks demonstrate the strength of the proposed method
over existing self-supervised methods in extracting information associated with
normal aging and in revealing the impact of neurodegenerative disorders. The

investigated the post-impact evolution of the X-ray emitting gas in SNR 1987A.
The hot plasma is represented by two non-equilibrium ionization components with
temperature of $\sim0.6$ keV and $\sim2.5$ keV. The low-temperature plasma has
a density $\sim2400$ cm$^{-3}$, which is likely dominated by the lower density
gas inside the equatorial ring (ER). The high-temperature plasma with a density
$\sim550$ cm$^{-3}$ could be dominated by the H II region and the high-latitude
material beyond the ring. In the last few years, the emission measure of the
low-temperature plasma has been decreasing, indicating that the blast wave has
left the main ER. But the blast wave is still propagating into the
high-latitude gas, resulting in the steadily increase of the high-temperature
emission measure. In the meantime, the average abundances of N, O, Ne, and Mg
are found to be declining, which may reflect the different chemical
compositions between two plasma components. We also detected the Fe K lines in
most of the observations, showing increasing flux and centroid energy. We

Continuous Anisotropic Model for Inclined Surfaces, a cost model compatible

This model acknowledges how the orientation of the robot with respect to any

terramechanic effects such as the slippage. Moreover, the proposed model can be
tuned to define a trade-off between energy minimization and Roll angle
reduction. The results from two simulation tests demonstrate how, to find the
optimal path in scenarios containing slopes, in certain situations the use of
this model can be more advantageous than relying on isotropic cost functions.
Finally, the outcome of a field experiment involving a skid-steering robot that

splashback and accretion shock in the outskirts of galaxy clusters while misses
a key ingredient of structure formation - processes associated with mergers. To
fill this gap, we perform simulations of merging self-similar clusters and
investigate their DM and gas evolution in an idealized cosmological context.
Our simulations show that the cluster rapidly contracts during the major merger
and the splashback radius $r_{\rm sp}$ decreases, approaching the virial radius
$r_{\rm vir}$. While $r_{\rm sp}$ correlates with a smooth mass accretion rate
(MAR) parameter $\Gamma_{\rm s}$ in the self-similar model, our simulations
show a similar trend with the total MAR $\Gamma_{\rm vir}$ (includes both
mergers and $\Gamma_{\rm s}$). The scatter of the $\Gamma_{\rm vir}-r_{\rm
sp}/r_{\rm vir}$ relation indicates a generally low $\Gamma_{\rm s}\sim1$ in
clusters in cosmological simulations. In contrast to the DM, the hot gaseous
atmospheres significantly expand by the merger-accelerated (MA-) shocks formed
when the runaway merger shocks overtake the outer accretion shock. After a
major merger, the MA-shock radius is larger than $r_{\rm sp}$ by a factor of up
to $\sim1.7$ for $\Gamma_{\rm s}\lesssim1$ and is $\sim r_{\rm sp}$ for
$\Gamma_{\rm s}\gtrsim3$. This implies that (1) mergers could easily generate
the MA-shock-splashback offset measured in cosmological simulations, and (2)
the smooth MAR is small in regions away from filaments where MA-shocks reside.
We further discuss various shocks and contact discontinuities formed at
different epochs of the merger, the ram pressure stripping in cluster
outskirts, and the dependence of member galaxies' splashback feature on their
orbital parameters.

integrated in a drift-diffusion solver. Surprisingly, the functional based on

mobility model has been calibrated using kinetic Monte Carlo calculations and
shows good agreement with the Monte Carlo calculations over the experimentally

aNN/$\alpha$ (mean inter-site distance / localization radius) of ~3 below which
hopping to non-nearest neighbors becomes important around room temperature and
the eGDM cannot be used for parameter extraction. Typical (Gaussian) disorder

sustained treatment strategies from observational data. An often cited
limitation of the parametric g-formula is the g-null paradox: a phenomenon in
which model misspecification in the parametric g-formula is guaranteed under
the conditions that motivate its use (i.e., when identifiability conditions
hold and measured time-varying confounders are affected by past treatment).
Many users of the parametric g-formula know they must acknowledge the g-null
paradox as a limitation when reporting results but still require clarity on its
meaning and implications. Here we revisit the g-null paradox to clarify its
role in causal inference studies. In doing so, we present analytic examples and
a simulation-based illustration of the bias of parametric g-formula estimates
under the conditions associated with this paradox. Our results highlight the
importance of avoiding overly parsimonious models for the components of the
g-formula when using this method.

complex fluid flows. One such algorithm, known as adaptive neural fuzzy
inference system (ANFIS), can generate data-driven predictions for flow fields
but has not been applied to natural geophysical flows in large-scale rivers.
Herein, we demonstrate the potential of ANFIS to produce three-dimensional (3D)
realizations of the instantaneous flood flow field in several large-scale,
virtual meandering rivers. The 3D dynamics of flood flow in large-scale rivers
were obtained using large-eddy simulation (LES). The LES results, i.e., the 3D
velocity components, were employed to train the learnable coefficients of an
ANFIS. The trained ANFIS, along with a few time-steps of LES results (precursor
data) were then used to produce 3D realizations of flood flow fields in
large-scale rivers with geometries other than the one the ANFIS was trained
with. We also used the trained ANFIS to generate 3D realizations of river flow
at a discharge other than that the ANFIS was trained with. The flow field
results obtained from ANFIS were validated using separate LES runs to assess
the accuracy of the 3D instantaneous realizations of the machine learning
algorithm. An error analysis was conducted to quantify the discrepancies among
the ANFIS and LES results for various flood flow predictions in large-scale

active-colloid experiments, numerical simulations and analytical work, we
explain how flocking liquids heal their spontaneous flows initially plagued by
collections of topological defects to achieve long-ranged polar order even in
two dimensions. We demonstrate that the self-similar ordering of flocking
matter is ruled by a living network of domain walls linking all $\pm 1$

orientational structure echoes the formation of extended density patterns in
the shape of interconnected bow ties. We establish that this double structure
emerges from the interplay between self-advection and density gradients
dressing each $-1$ topological charges with four orientation walls. We then
explain how active Magnus forces link all topological charges with extended
domain walls, while elastic interactions drive their attraction along the
resulting filamentous network of polarization singularities. Taken together our
experimental, numerical and analytical results illuminate the suppression of
all flow singularities, and the emergence of pristine unidirectional order in
flocking matter.

process of mass assembly that results in the formation of a low-mass star. This
parameter has been largely studied in Classical TTauri stars in star-forming
regions with ages of 1-10Myr. However, little is known about the accretion
properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) in younger regions and early stages
of star formation, such as in the Class0/I phases. We present new NIR spectra
of 17 ClassI/Flat and 35 ClassII sources located in the young (<1Myr) NGC1333
cluster, acquired with the KMOS instrument at the VLT. Our goal is to study
whether the mass accretion rate evolves with age, as suggested by the widely
adopted viscous evolution model, by comparing the properties of the NGC1333
members with samples of older regions. We measured the stellar parameters and
accretion rates of our sample, finding a correlation between accretion and
stellar luminosity, and between mass accretion rate and stellar mass. Both
correlations are compatible within the errors with the older Lupus star-forming
region, while only the latter is consistent with results from ChamaeleonI. The
ClassI sample shows larger accretion luminosities with respect to the ClassII
stars of the same cloud. However, the derived accretion rates are not
sufficiently high to build up the inferred stellar masses, assuming steady
accretion during the ClassI lifetime. This suggests that the sources are not in
their main accretion phase and that most of their mass has already been
accumulated during a previous stage and/or that the accretion is an episodic
phenomenon. We show that some of the targets originally classified as Class I
through Spitzer photometry are in fact evolved or low accreting objects. This
evidence can have implications for the estimated protostellar phase lifetimes.
Further observations are needed to determine if this is a general result.

running time is up to polylogarithmic factors equal to that of solving maximum
flow in a sparse graph with $O(\vert V \vert)$ vertices and polynomial integral

high precision any convex function defined on the submodular base polytope,

the cut function of a certain graph that we construct. We solve this

  A key challenge is to enforce that a learned controller must be stabilizing.
This paper proposes a Lyapunov regularized RL approach for optimal frequency

we show that coinductive equivalences can be extended to a modal setting, and
we do so by generalising Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity to coeffectful

program relations based on the novel notion of a comonadic lax extension, on
top of which we define a modal extension of Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity
(which we dub modal applicative bisimilarity). We prove such a relation to be a

modal and coeffectful behaviours. But this is not the end of the story: we also
establish a correspondence between modal program relations and program

revealing that modal program equivalences and program distances are just two

an X-ray to UV brightness ratio of $\alpha_{\rm OX} = -1.36 \pm 0.11$. We

fit of the structure is uncertain, we find that it has a luminosity of

potentially represent the most distant quasar jet yet seen in X-rays. We find
no evidence for excess X-ray emission where the previously-reported radio jets
are seen (which have an overall linear extent of $0.^{\prime\prime}28$), and a
bright X-ray point source located along the jet axis to the SE is revealed by

From five 3D models spanning T=3964-6726K (approx. spectral types K8V-F3V),
synthetic spectra at hyper-high resolution (R>1,000,000) were analyzed.
Selected FeI and FeII lines at various positions across stellar disks were
searched for patterns between different lines in the same star and for similar
lines between different stars. Such patterns are identified for representative
photospheric lines of different strengths, excitation potential, and ionization
level, encoding the hydrodynamic 3D structure. Line profiles and bisectors are
shown for various stars at different positions across stellar disks. Absolute
convective wavelength shifts are obtained as differences to 1D models, where
such shifts do not occur. Observable relationships for line properties are
retrieved from realistically complex synthetic spectra. Such patterns may also
test very detailed 3D modeling, including non-LTE effects. While present
results are obtained at hyper-high spectral resolution, the subsequent Paper V
examines their practical observability at realistically lower resolutions, and

NaCaBi can also be indicated by $\bar{6}$ symmetry. More surprisingly, the

and correctly capturing and explaining the detailed features in the

numerical models. In order to keep up with the quantity and quality of
observational datasets, improved prescriptions for galactic chemical evolution
need to be incorporated into the simulations. Here we present a new, flexible,
time resolved chemical enrichment model for cosmological simulations. Our model
allows to easily change a number of stellar physics parameters such as the
shape of the initial mass function (IMF), stellar lifetimes, chemical yields or
SN Ia delay times. We implement our model into the Gasoline2 code and perform a
series of cosmological simulations varying a number of key parameters, foremost
evaluating different stellar yield sets for massive stars from the literature.
We find that total metallicity, total iron abundance and gas phase oxygen
abundance are robust predictions from different yield sets and in agreement
with observational relations. On the other hand, individual element abundances,
especially $\alpha$-elements show significant differences across different
yield sets and none of our models can simultaneously match constraints on the
dwarf and MW mass scale. This offers a unique way of observationally
constraining model parameters. For MW mass galaxies we find for most yield
tables tested in this work a bimodality in the $[\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane

galaxies experience an early period of bursty star formation that transitions
to a late-time steady phase of near-constant star formation. Stars formed
during the late-time steady phase have more circular orbits and thin-disc-like
morphology at $z=0$, whilst stars born during the bursty phase have more radial
orbits and thick-disc structure. The median age of thick-disc stars at $z=0$
correlates strongly with this transition time. We also find that galaxies with
an earlier transition from bursty to steady star formation have a higher
thin-disc fractions at $z=0$. Three of our systems have minor mergers with
LMC-size satellites during the thin-disc phase. These mergers trigger short
starbursts but do not destroy the thin disc nor alter broad trends between the
star formation transition time and thin/thick disc properties. If our
simulations are representative of the Universe, then stellar archaeological
studies of the Milky Way (or M31) provide a window into past star-formation
modes in the Galaxy. Current age estimates of the Galactic thick disc would

high-resolution (particle mass of $1\ {\rm M_\odot}$) hydrodynamical
simulations coupled with a time-dependent H$_2$ chemistry network. The results
are then post-processed with an accurate chemistry network to model the
associated C$^+$/C/CO abundances, based on the time-dependent non-steady-state
(``non-equilibrium'') H$_2$ abundances. We find that the time-averaged star
formation rate and the ISM structure are insensitive to metallicity. The column
densities relevant for molecular shielding appear correlated with the volume
densities in gravitationally unstable gas. As metallicity decreases, H$_2$
progressively deviates from steady state (``equilibrium'') and shows shallow
abundance profiles until they sharply truncate at the photodissociation fronts.
In contrast, the CO profile is sharp and controlled by photodissociation as CO
quickly reaches steady state. We construct effective one-dimensional cloud
models that successfully capture the time-averaged chemical distributions in
simulations. At low metallicities, the steady-state model significantly
overestimates the abundance of H$_2$ in the diffuse medium. The overestimated
H$_2$, however, has little impact on CO. Consequently, the mass fraction of
CO-dark H$_2$ gas is significantly lower than what a fully steady-state model
predicts. The mass ratios of H$_2$/C$^+$ and H$_2$/C both show a weaker
dependence on $Z^{\prime}$ than H$_2$/CO, which potentially indicates that
C$^+$ and C could be alternative tracers for H$_2$ at low $Z^{\prime}$ in terms
of mass budget. Our chemistry code for post-processing is publicly available.

higher fragmentation rate and carbon loss compared to regular PAHs. The
fragmentation of PAHs with alkylated sidegroups forms species with peripheral
pentagonal cycles, which can be more stable than the bare PAH cations. This
stability is quantified and the most stable species, for which there is an
effective competition of the fragmentation with isomerization and radiative
cooling are identified. This work supports a scenario in which the evaporation
of nanograins with a mixed aliphatic and aromatic composition followed by VUV
photoprocessing results in both the production of the carriers of the 3.4um AIB

future gravitational waveform models. These are the precession amplitude
$\langle\theta_L\rangle$, the precession frequency $\langle \Omega_L\rangle$,
the nutation amplitude $\Delta\theta_L$, the nutation frequency $\omega$, and
the precession-frequency variation $\Delta\Omega_L$. We investigate the
evolution of these five parameters during the inspiral and explore their
statistical properties for sources with isotropic spins. In particular, we find

spectral and eigenstate dualities are locally defined near the transition and
can, in many cases, be explicitly constructed by considering relatively small
commensurate approximants. The construction relies on auxiliary 2D Fermi
surfaces obtained as functions of the phase-twisting boundary conditions and of
the phase-shifting real-space structure. We show that, around the critical
point of the limiting quasiperiodic system, the auxiliary Fermi surface of a
high-enough-order approximant converges to a universal form. This allows us to
devise a highly-accurate method to obtain mobility edges and duality
transformations for generic 1D quasiperiodic systems through their commensurate
approximants. To illustrate the power of this approach, we consider several
previously studied systems, including generalized Aubry-Andr\'e models and
coupled Moir\'e chains. Our findings bring a new perspective to examine
quasiperiodicity-induced extended-to-localized transitions in 1D, provide a
working criterion for the appearance of mobility edges, and an explicit way to
understand the properties of eigenstates close to and at the transition.

head-mounted display VR. In traditional 360-degree VR experiences,
translational movement in the real world is not reflected in the virtual world,

evaluated whether a new Artificial Intelligence (AI) software designed to

reduce oculomotor or disorientation measures of sickness. No changes have been

its data private. In this paradigm, only model updates, such as model weights

FL, where each party has the entire feature set and labels in the training data
set. However, many real scenarios follow a vertically-partitioned FL setup,
where a complete feature set is formed only when all the datasets from the
parties are combined, and the labels are only available to a single party.
Privacy-preserving vertical FL is challenging because complete sets of labels
and features are not owned by one entity. Existing approaches for vertical FL
require multiple peer-to-peer communications among parties, leading to lengthy
training times, and are restricted to (approximated) linear models and just two

the daily formation of an extremely elongated cloud extending as far as 1800 km
westward from Arsia Mons. It takes place in the Solar Longitude (Ls) range of
~220-320, around the Southern solstice. We study this Arsia Mons Elongated
Cloud (AMEC) using images from different orbiters, including ESA Mars Express,
NASA MAVEN, Viking 2, MRO, and ISRO Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM). We study the
AMEC in detail in Martian Year (MY) 34 in terms of Local Time and Ls and find
that it exhibits a very rapid daily cycle: the cloud growth starts before
sunrise on the western slope of the volcano, followed by a westward expansion
that lasts 2.5 hours with a velocity of around 170 m/s in the mesosphere (~45
km over the areoid). The cloud formation then ceases, it detaches from its
formation point, and continues moving westward until it evaporates before the
afternoon, when most sun-synchronous orbiters observe. Moreover we
comparatively study observations from different years (i.e. MYs 29-34) in
search of interannual variations and find that in MY33 the cloud exhibits lower
activity, whilst in MY34 the beginning of its formation was delayed compared to
other years, most likely due to the Global Dust Storm. This phenomenon takes
place in a season known for the general lack of clouds on Mars. In this paper
we focus on observations, and a theoretical interpretation will be the subject
of a separate paper.

lobulation, and calcification of lung nodules is critical in cancer management.
The characterisation of these attributes is often subjective, which may lead to
high inter- and intra-observer variability. Furthermore, lung nodules are often
heterogeneous in the cross-sectional image slices of a 3D volume. Current
state-of-the-art methods that score multiple attributes rely on deep
learning-based multi-task learning (MTL) schemes. These methods, however,
extract shared visual features across attributes and then examine each
attribute without explicitly leveraging their inherent intercorrelations.
Furthermore, current methods either treat each slice with equal importance
without considering their relevance or heterogeneity, which limits performance.
In this study, we address these challenges with a new convolutional neural
network (CNN)-based MTL model that incorporates multiple attention-based
learning modules to simultaneously score 9 visual attributes of lung nodules in
computed tomography (CT) image volumes. Our model processes entire nodule
volumes of arbitrary depth and uses a slice attention module to filter out
irrelevant slices. We also introduce cross-attribute and attribute
specialisation attention modules that learn an optimal amalgamation of
meaningful representations to leverage relationships between attributes. We
demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods at
scoring attributes using the well-known public LIDC-IDRI dataset of pulmonary
nodules from over 1,000 patients. Our model also performs competitively when
repurposed for benign-malignant classification. Our attention modules also
provide easy-to-interpret weights that offer insights into the predictions of

single, temporally discrete decisions within the framework of expected utility
theory (EUT) and behavioral theories such as prospect theory. In this work, we
study prosumer decision making in a more natural, ongoing market situation in
which a prosumer has to decide every day whether to sell any surplus energy
units generated by the solar panels on her roof or hold (store) the energy
units in anticipation of a future sale at a better price. Within this context,
we propose a new behavioral model that extends EUT to take into account the
notion of a bounded temporal horizon over which various decision parameters are
considered. Specifically, we introduce the notion of a bounded time window (the
number of upcoming days over which a prosumer evaluates the probability that
each possible price will be the highest) that prosumers implicitly impose on
their decision making in arriving at hold or sell decisions. The new behavioral
model assumes that humans make decisions that will affect their lives within a
bounded time window regardless of how far into the future their units may be
sold. Modeling the utility of the prosumer using parameters such as the offered
price on a day, the number of energy units the prosumer has available for sale
on a day, and the probabilities of the forecast prices, we fit both traditional
EUT and the proposed behavioral model with bounded time windows to data
collected from 57 homeowners over 68 days in a simulated energy market. Each
prosumer generated surplus units of solar power and had the opportunity to sell
those units to the local utility at the price set that day by the utility or
hold the units for sale in the future. For most participants, a bounded horizon
in the range of 4-5 days provided a much better fit to their responses than was
found for the traditional (unbounded) EUT model

an inexplicable equilibrium between the bulk and horizon temperatures. In this

R_h=ct universe, which has thus far been highly successful in resolving many
other problems or inconsistencies in LCDM. We find that S_bulk is constant in
this model, eliminating the so-called initial entropy problem simply and
elegantly. The GSL may still be relevant, however, principally in selecting the
arrow of time, given that S_h ~ t^2 in this model.

which are of the form $y^2=x^3+A(T)x+B(T)$, with non-constant $j$-invariant. We
define the $r$\textsuperscript{th} moment of an elliptic curve to be
$A_{r,E}(p) := \frac1{p} \sum_{t \bmod p} a_t(p)^r$, where $a_t(p)$ is $p$
minus the number of solutions to $y^2 = x^3 + A(t)x + B(t) \bmod p$. Rosen and
Silverman showed biases in the first moment equal the rank of the Mordell-Weil
group of rational solutions. Michel proved that $pA_{2,E}(p)=p^2+O(p^{3/2})$.
Based on several special families where computations can be done in closed
form, Miller in his thesis conjectured that the largest lower-order term in the
second moment that does not average to $0$ is on average negative. He further
showed that such a negative bias has implications in the distribution of zeros
of the elliptic curve $L$-function near the central point. To date, evidence
for this conjecture is limited to special families. In this paper, we explore
the first and second moments of some one- and two-parameter families of
elliptic curves, looking to see if the biases persist and exploring the
consequence these have on fundamental properties of elliptic curves. We observe
that in all of the one- and two-parameter families where we can compute in
closed form that the first term that does not average to zero in the
second-moment expansion of the Dirichlet coefficients has a negative average.
In addition to studying some additional families where the calculations can be
done in closed form, we also systematically investigate families of various
rank. These are the first general tests of the conjecture; while we cannot in
general obtain closed form solutions, we discuss computations which support or
contradict the conjecture. We then generalize to higher moments, and see
evidence that the bias continues in the even moments.

deviations from the process generating the normal data are often small or
intentionally hidden. Novelties can be detected by modeling normal sequences
and measuring the deviations of a new sequence from the model predictions.
However, in many applications data is generated by several distinct processes
so that models trained on all the data tend to over-generalize and novelties
remain undetected. We propose to approach this challenge through decomposition:
by clustering the data we break down the problem, obtaining simpler modeling
task in each cluster which can be modeled more accurately. However, this comes
at a trade-off, since the amount of training data per cluster is reduced. This
is a particular problem for discrete sequences where state-of-the-art models
are data-hungry. The success of this approach thus depends on the quality of
the clustering, i.e., whether the individual learning problems are sufficiently
simpler than the joint problem. While clustering discrete sequences
automatically is a challenging and domain-specific task, it is often easy for
human domain experts, given the right tools. In this paper, we adapt a
state-of-the-art visual analytics tool for discrete sequence clustering to
obtain informed clusters from domain experts and use LSTMs to model each
cluster individually. Our extensive empirical evaluation indicates that this
informed clustering outperforms automatic ones and that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art novelty detection methods for discrete sequences
in three real-world application scenarios. In particular, decomposition

the set classifier returns more than one label. We validated SCRIB on several

provides one of our most accessible views of protoplanetary discs. If set by
radiative equilibrium with the central star, the temperature of dust in the
disc plateaus at around $10-20$K in the outer regions. However sufficiently
nearby massive stars can heat the outer disc to substantially higher
temperatures. In this paper we study the radiative equilibrium temperature of
discs in the presence of massive external sources and gauge the effect that it
has on millimetre dust mass estimates. Since millimetre grains are not
entrained in any wind we focus on geometrically simple 2D-axisymmetric disc
models using radiative transfer calculations with both the host star and an
external source. Recent surveys have searched for evidence of massive stars
influencing disc evolution using disc properties as a function of projected
separation. In assuming a disc temperature of $20$K for a disc a distance $D$
from a strong radiation source, disc masses are overestimated by a factor that
scales with $D^{-1/2}$ interior to the separation that external heating becomes
important. This could significantly alter dust mass estimates of discs in close
proximity to $\theta^1$C in the Orion Nebular Cluster. We also make an initial
assessment of the effect upon snow lines. Within a parsec of an O star like
$\theta^1$C a CO snow line no longer exists, though the water snow line is
virtually unaffected except for very close separations of $\leq0.01\,$pc.

this method the voters give (weak) ordinal preference ballots which are used to
define the weighted majority graph (WMG) of direct comparisons between pairs of
candidates. The choice of the winner comes from indirect comparisons in the
graph, and more specifically from considering directed paths instead of direct
comparisons between candidates.
  When the input is the WMG, to our knowledge, the fastest algorithm for
computing all winners in the Schulze method uses a folklore reduction to the
All-Pairs Bottleneck Paths problem and runs in $O(m^{2.69})$ time, where $m$ is
the number of candidates. It is an interesting open question whether this can
be improved. Our first result is a combinatorial algorithm with a nearly
quadratic running time for computing all winners. This running time is
essentially optimal. If the input to the Schulze winners problem is not the WMG
but the preference profile, then constructing the WMG is a bottleneck that
increases the running time significantly; in the special case when there are
$m$ candidates and $n=O(m)$ voters, the running time is $O(m^{2.69})$, or
$O(m^{2.5})$ if there is a nearly-linear time algorithm for multiplying dense
square matrices. To address this bottleneck, we prove a formal equivalence
between the well-studied Dominance Product problem and the problem of computing
the WMG. We prove a similar connection between the so called Dominating Pairs
problem and the problem of finding a winner in the Schulze method.
  Our paper is the first to bring fine-grained complexity into the field of
computational social choice. Using it we can identify voting protocols that are
unlikely to be practical for large numbers of candidates and/or voters, as
their complexity is likely, say at least cubic.

reproduce specific mineral configurations. To do so, assemblies of cells,
products of a modified Voronoi tessellation, are joined in mechanically-stable
layerings using a bonding law. The cells' shape distribution allows us to set a
level of inherent anisotropy to the material. Using a diametral point loading,
and systematically changing the loading orientation with respect to the cells'
configuration, we characterize the failure strength of increasingly anisotropic
structures. This approach ends up reproducing experimental observations and
lets us quantify the statistical variability of strength, the consumption of
the fragmentation energy, and the induced anisotropies linked to the cell's
geometry and force transmission in the samples. Based on a fine description of
geometrical and mechanical properties at the onset of failure, we develop a
micromechanical breakdown of the crushing strength variability using an
analytical decomposition of the stress tensor and the geometrical and force
anisotropies. We can conclude that the origins of failure strength in
anisotropic layered media rely on compensations of geometrical and mechanical
anisotropies, as well as an increasing average radial force between minerals

  Smoothness",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As the medical usage of computed tomography (CT) continues to grow, the
radiation dose should remain at a low level to reduce the health risks.
Therefore, there is an increasing need for algorithms that can reconstruct
high-quality images from low-dose scans. In this regard, most of the recent
studies have focused on iterative reconstruction algorithms, and little
attention has been paid to restoration of the projection measurements, i.e.,
the sinogram. In this paper, we propose a novel sinogram interpolation
algorithm. The proposed algorithm exploits the self-similarity and smoothness
of the sinogram. Sinogram self-similarity is modeled in terms of the similarity
of small blocks extracted from stacked projections. The smoothness is modeled
via second-order total variation. Experiments with simulated and real CT data
show that sinogram interpolation with the proposed algorithm leads to a
substantial improvement in the quality of the reconstructed image, especially
on low-dose scans. The proposed method can result in a significant reduction in
the number of projection measurements. This will reduce the radiation dose and
also the amount of data that need to be stored or transmitted, if the
reconstruction is to be performed in a remote site.

tackle this problem, we present the implementation on a modular Python code of

rigorously describes the full thermodyamics of crystals accounting for nuclear

evaluation of the Born-Oppenheimer energy, as well as its derivatives with
respect to ionic positions (forces) and cell parameters (stress tensor) in
supercells, which can be provided, for instance, by first principles
density-functional-theory codes. The method performs crystal geometry
relaxation on the quantum free energy landscape, optimizing the free energy
with respect to all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure. It can be used
to determine the phase diagram of any crystal at finite temperature. It enables
the calculation of phase boundaries for both first-order and second-order phase
transitions from the Hessian of the free energy. Finally, the code can also
compute the anharmonic phonon spectra, including the phonon linewidths, as well
as phonon spectral functions. We review the theoretical framework of the
stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation and its dynamical extension,
making particular emphasis on the physical interpretation of the variables
present in the theory that can enlighten the comparison with any other

relative cost and benefits of information in producing work in cyclic operation
of thermodynamic engines (by Sandberg etal. 2014). Specifically, we study the
general case of overdamped particles in a time-varying potential (control
action) in feedback that utilizes continuous measurements (nonlinear filtering)
of a thermodynamic ensemble, to produce suitable adaptations of the second law
of thermodynamics that involve information.

63\% with autonomous activation using the behaviour selection policy. In real

consider the locomotion of an untethered robot, in the granular medium,
comprised of multiple flexible flagella that rotate about an axis by a motor.
Drag from the grains causes the flagella to deform and the deformed shape
generates a net forward propulsion. This external drag force depends on the
shape of the flagella, while the change in flagellar shape is the result of the
competition between the external loading and elastic forces. We introduce a
numerical tool that couples discrete differential geometry based simulation of
elastic rods - our model for flagella - and a resistive force theory based
model for the drag. In parallel with simulations, we conduct experiments to
quantify the propulsive speed of this class of robots. We find reasonable
quantitative agreement between experiments and simulations. Owing to a
rod-based kinematic representation of the robot, the simulation runs faster
than real-time, and, therefore, we can use it as a design tool for this class
of soft robots. We find that there is an optimal rotational speed at which
maximum efficiency is achieved. Moreover, both experiments and simulations show
that increasing the number of flagella decreases the speed of the robot. We
also gain insight into the mechanics of granular medium - while resistive force
theory can successfully describe the propulsion at low number of flagella, it
fails when more flagella are added to the robot.

both developers and users, but particular aspects of testing in game
development can lead to difficulties in effectively catching these missed bugs.
It has become common practice for developers to apply updates to games in order
to fix missed bugs. These updates are often accompanied by notes that describe
the changes to the game included in the update. However, some bugs reappear
even after an update attempts to fix them. In this paper, we develop a taxonomy
for bug types in games that is based on prior work. We examine 12,122 bug fixes
from 723 updates for 30 popular games on the Steam platform. We label the bug
fixes included in these updates to identify the frequency of these different
bug types, the rate at which bug types recur over multiple updates, and which
bug types are treated as more severe. Additionally, we survey game developers
regarding their experience with different bug types and what aspects of game
development they most strongly associate with bug appearance. We find that
Information bugs appear the most frequently in updates, while Crash bugs recur
the most frequently and are often treated as more severe than other bug types.
Finally, we find that challenges in testing, code quality, and bug reproduction
have a close association with bug persistence. These findings should help
developers identify which aspects of game development could benefit from
greater attention in order to prevent bugs. Researchers can use our results in
devising tools and methods to better identify and address certain bug types.

proportion of the tested hypotheses concern non-null effects and the individual
effects are only moderately large, so that they generally do not stand out
individually, for example in a Bonferroni analysis. Such rare/weak models have
been studied in quite a few settings, for example in some cases studies focused
on underlying Gaussian means model for the hypotheses being tested; in some
others, Poisson. It seems not to have been noticed before that such seemingly
different models have asymptotically the following common structure:
Summarizing the evidence each test provides by the negative logarithm of its
P-value, previous rare/weak model settings are asymptotically equivalent to
detection where most negative log P-values have a standard exponential
distribution but a small fraction of the P-values might have an alternative
distribution which is moderately larger; we do not know which individual tests
those might be, or even if there are any such. Moreover, the alternative
distribution is noncentral chisquared on one degree of freedom. We characterize
the asymptotic performance of global tests combining these P-values in terms of
the chisquared mixture parameters: the scaling parameters controlling
heteroscedasticity, the non-centrality parameter describing the effect size
whenever it exists, and the parameter controlling the rarity of the non-null
effects. Specifically, in a phase space involving the last two parameters, we
derive a region where all tests are asymptotically powerless. Outside of this
region, the Berk-Jones and the Higher Criticism tests have maximal power.
Inference techniques based on the minimal P-value, false-discovery rate
controlling, and Fisher's test have sub-optimal asymptotic phase diagrams. We
provide various examples for multiple testing problems of the said common
structure.

mass and spin determined by the properties of its parent black holes. Using the

a half observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Virgo, we calculate the population
properties of the leftover remnant black holes. By integrating their rate of
formation over the age of the universe, we estimate the number density of
remnant black holes today. Using simple prescriptions for the cosmic star
formation rate and black hole inspiral delay times, we determine the number
density of this leftover black hole population to be $660_{-240}^{+440}
\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$, corresponding to $\sim 60,000$ black hole remnants per
Milky-Way-equivalent galaxy. The mass spectrum of these remnants starts at
$\sim 10 M_\odot$ and can be approximated by a decreasing exponential with
characteristic length $\sim 15 M_\odot$, the final spin distribution is sharply
peaked at $\chi_f\sim0.7$, and the kick velocities range from tens to thousands
of km/s. These kick velocities suggest that globular clusters and nuclear star
clusters may retain up to $3_{-2}^{+3}\%$ and $46_{-15}^{+17}\%$ of their
remnant black holes, respectively, while young star clusters would only retain
a few tenths of a percent. The estimates in this work assume that none of the
remnants participate in subsequent hierarchical mergers. If hierarchical
mergers occur, the overall number density would drop accordingly and the
remnant mass distribution shape would evolve over time. This population of
leftover black holes is an inescapable result from gravitational-wave
observations of binary black-hole mergers.

semi-batch SCVP system allowing a sequence of feeding operations during the

weights as well as polydispersity index of hyperbranched polymers can be
explicitly given, which are determined by predetermined feeding details and
conversions in each polymerization step. These analytical results are further
confirmed by the corresponding Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore the present GF

estimate high-resolution subsurface models from seismograms, is a powerful
imaging technique in exploration geophysics. In recent years, the computational
cost of FWI has grown exponentially due to the increasing size and resolution
of seismic data. Moreover, it is a non-convex problem and can encounter local
minima due to the limited accuracy of the initial velocity models or the
absence of low frequencies in the measurements. To overcome these computational
issues, we develop a multiscale data-driven FWI method based on fully

a real-time style transform method to create a large set of synthetic
subsurface velocity models from natural images. We then develop two
convolutional neural networks with encoder-decoder structure to reconstruct the
low- and high-frequency components of the subsurface velocity models,
separately. To validate the performance of our data-driven inversion method and
the effectiveness of the synthesized training set, we compare it with
conventional physics-based waveform inversion approaches using both synthetic

fully trained, it can significantly reduce the computation time, and yield more
accurate subsurface velocity models in comparison with conventional FWI.

determining the extent of lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis. Motivated
by this, we introduce Fibrosis-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design
tailored for the prediction of pulmonary fibrosis progression from chest CT

determine a strong architectural design for CT lung analysis, upon which we
build a customized network design tailored for predicting forced vital capacity

clinical metadata. Finally, we leverage an explainability-driven performance
validation strategy to study the decision-making behaviour of Fibrosis-Net as
to verify that predictions are based on relevant visual indicators in CT

a significantly higher modified Laplace Log Likelihood score than the winning

for $\alpha\in [0, 1].$ The $A_\alpha$-spectrum of a graph $G$ consists of all
the eigenvalues (including the multiplicities) of $A_\alpha(G).$ A graph $G$ is
said to be determined by the generalized $A_{\alpha}$-spectrum (or,
DGA$_\alpha$S for short) if whenever $H$ is a graph such that $H$ and $G$ share
the same $A_{\alpha}$-spectrum and so do their complements, then $H$ is

segment camouflaged objects hiding in their surroundings. Existing COD models
are built upon binary ground truth to segment the camouflaged objects without
illustrating the level of camouflage. In this paper, we revisit this task and
argue that explicitly modeling the conspicuousness of camouflaged objects
against their particular backgrounds can not only lead to a better
understanding about camouflage and evolution of animals, but also provide
guidance to design more sophisticated camouflage techniques. Furthermore, we
observe that it is some specific parts of the camouflaged objects that make
them detectable by predators. With the above understanding about camouflaged
objects, we present the first ranking based COD network (Rank-Net) to
simultaneously localize, segment and rank camouflaged objects. The localization
model is proposed to find the discriminative regions that make the camouflaged

different camouflaged objects. Moreover, we contribute a large COD testing set

are best suited for last-mile delivery, i.e., the delivery from the package
distribution centers (PDCs) to the customers. Since a typical delivery system
consists of multiple PDCs, each having random and time-varying demands, the
dynamic drone-to-PDC allocation would be of great importance in meeting the
demand in an efficient manner. In this paper, we study the dynamic UAV
assignment problem for a drone delivery system with the goal of providing
measurable Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. We adopt a queueing theoretic
approach to model the customer-service nature of the problem. Furthermore, we
take a deep reinforcement learning approach to obtain a dynamic policy for the
re-allocation of the UAVs. This policy guarantees a probabilistic upper-bound
on the queue length of the packages waiting in each PDC, which is beneficial
from both the service provider's and the customers' viewpoints. We evaluate the

blockchain-based IoT access control schemes have been the most popular ones,
they suffer from several significant limitations, such as high monetary cost
and low throughput of processing access requests. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a novel IoT access control scheme by combining
the fee-less IOTA technology and the Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based
Encryption (CP-ABE) technology. To control the access to a resource, a token,
which records access permissions to this resource, is encrypted by the CP-ABE
technology and uploaded to the IOTA Tangle (i.e., the underlying database of
IOTA). Any user can fetch the encrypted token from the Tangle, while only those
who can decrypt this token are authorized to access the resource. In this way,
the proposed scheme enables not only distributed, fee-less and scalable access
control thanks to the IOTA but also fine-grained attribute-based access control
thanks to the CP-ABE. We show the feasibility of our scheme by implementing a
proof-of-concept prototype system and evaluate its performance in terms of

known for decades. However, we still have an incomplete theoretical and
experimental understanding of how these particles and their dynamics give rise
to the quantum bound state of the proton and its physical properties, such as
for example its spin. The two up and the single down quarks that comprise the
proton in the simplest picture account only for a few percent of the proton
mass, the bulk of which is in the form of quark kinetic and potential energy
and gluon energy from the strong force. An essential feature of this force, as
described by quantum chromodynamics, is its ability to create matter-antimatter
quark pairs inside the proton that exist only for a very short time. Their
fleeting existence makes the antimatter quarks within protons difficult to
study, but their existence is discernible in reactions where a
matter-antimatter quark pair annihilates. In this picture of quark-antiquark
creation by the strong force, the probability distributions as a function of
momentum for the presence of up and down antimatter quarks should be nearly
identical, since their masses are quite similar and small compared to the mass
of the proton. In the present manuscript, we show evidence from muon pair
production measurements that these distributions are significantly different,
with more abundant down antimatter quarks than up antimatter quarks over a wide
range of momentum. These results revive interest in several proposed mechanisms
as the origin of this antimatter asymmetry in the proton that had been
disfavored by the previous results and point to the future measurements that
can distinguish between these mechanisms.

operation is a well-known method for morphological feature extraction. As the
morphological operation is performed well in hand-crafted image segmentation
techniques, it is also promising to design an approach to approximate
morphological operation in the convolutional networks. However, using the
traditional convolutional neural network as a black-box is usually hard to
specify the morphological operation action. Here, we introduced a 3D
morphological operation residual block to extract morphological features in
end-to-end deep learning models for semantic segmentation. This study proposed
a novel network block architecture that embedded the morphological operation as
an infinitely strong prior in the convolutional neural network. Several 3D deep
learning models with the proposed morphological operation block were built and
compared in different medical imaging segmentation tasks. Experimental results
showed the proposed network achieved a relatively higher performance in the
segmentation tasks comparing with the conventional approach. In conclusion, the
novel network block could be easily embedded in traditional networks and
efficiently reinforce the deep learning models for medical imaging

a unified framework of constructing sketching methods in kernel ridge

rescaled sub-sampling matrices with independent columns. Our framework
incorporates two commonly used sketching methods, sub-sampling sketches (known
as the Nystr\""om method) and sub-Gaussian sketches, as special cases with m=1

error analysis of sketching approximation and show that our accumulation scheme
improves the low accuracy of sub-sampling sketches when certain incoherence
characteristic is high, and accelerates the more accurate but computationally
heavier sub-Gaussian sketches. By optimally choosing the number m of
accumulations, we show that a best trade-off between computational efficiency
and statistical accuracy can be achieved. In practice, the sketching method can
be as efficiently implemented as the sub-sampling sketches, as only minor extra
matrix additions are needed. Our empirical evaluations also demonstrate that
the proposed method may attain the accuracy close to sub-Gaussian sketches,

the task-specific parameters act as local adapters for each task, and help in
efficiently obtaining task-specific feature maps. Moreover, we propose an
element-wise addition of residual bias in the transformed feature space, which
further helps stabilize GAN training in such settings. Our approach also
leverages task similarity information based on the Fisher information matrix.
Leveraging this knowledge from previous tasks significantly improves the model
performance. In addition, the similarity measure also helps reduce the
parameter growth in continual adaptation and helps to learn a compact model. In
contrast to the recent approaches for continually-learned GANs, the proposed

be changed to a particular target label if hidden backdoors are activated. So
far, backdoor research has mostly been conducted towards classification tasks.
In this paper, we reveal that this threat could also happen in semantic

to maliciously manipulate the segmentation models from the image-level, we
propose a novel attack paradigm, the \emph{fine-grained attack}, where we treat

image-level to achieve more sophisticated manipulation. In the annotation of
poisoned samples generated by the fine-grained attack, only pixels of specific
objects will be labeled with the attacker-specified target class while others
are still with their ground-truth ones. Experiments show that the proposed
methods can successfully attack semantic segmentation models by poisoning only

practical usages. Based on this processing, we found that different image
regions have different restoration difficulties and can be processed by
networks with different capacities. Intuitively, smooth areas are easier to
super-solve than complex textures. To utilize this property, we can adopt
appropriate SR networks to process different sub-images after the
decomposition. On this basis, we propose a new solution pipeline -- ClassSR
that combines classification and SR in a unified framework. In particular, it
first uses a Class-Module to classify the sub-images into different classes
according to restoration difficulties, then applies an SR-Module to perform SR
for different classes. The Class-Module is a conventional classification
network, while the SR-Module is a network container that consists of the
to-be-accelerated SR network and its simplified versions. We further introduce
a new classification method with two losses -- Class-Loss and Average-Loss to
produce the classification results. After joint training, a majority of
sub-images will pass through smaller networks, thus the computational cost can
be significantly reduced. Experiments show that our ClassSR can help most

while effectively keeping the comoving distance to the last scattering surface

four covariate adjustment methods. We show that under mild conditions, the
resulting covariate-adjusted factorial effect estimators are consistent,
jointly asymptotically normal, and generally more efficient than the unadjusted
estimator. In addition, we propose Neyman-type conservative estimators for the
asymptotic covariances to facilitate valid inferences. Simulation studies and a

crucial challenges: transmit antenna selection (TAS), artificial noise (AN)

As the size of signal constellation tends to medium-scale or large-scale, the
complexity of traditional maximum likelihood detector becomes prohibitive. To
reduce this complexity, a low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detector is
proposed. To further enhance the secrecy rate (SR) performance, a
deep-neural-network (DNN) PA strategy is proposed. Simulation results show that

systematically investigated the impact of nuclear size to demonstrate that it
is indeed a decisive factor in chromatin mobility. To this end, we established
a method to quantify chromatin motion inside the nucleus, while excluding the
contribution of the movement of the nucleus itself, which allowed us to extract
the intrinsic mean-squared displacement (iMSD) of individual chromosomal loci
in moving nuclei from the correlated motion of two loci. We show that a simple

clustering accuracy in such situations. To cope with deficiency, in this paper,
we propose to consider a hypergraph model to facilitate having a variable

so, an optimization problem is defined based on a set of regularization terms

a feature extractor that extracts features from an image, a policy branch that

mechanism into them. The attention mechanism applies a mask processing to the
feature maps of each branch using mask-attention that expresses the judgment
reason for the policy and state value with a heat map. We visualized
mask-attention maps for games on the Atari 2600 and found we could easily
analyze the reasons behind an agent's decision-making in various game tasks.

overall accurate and robust MAV tracking while ensuring the object being

It remedies the domain gap with enhanced transferable features by using

kinematics, which exploits temporal continuity to transfer motion directions
with smaller gap rather than position values, relieving the adaptation burden.
Moreover, we propose a KV-Relation-ATT to transfer the co-occurrence signals of
kinematics and vision. Such features attended by correlation similarity are
more informative for enhancing domain-invariance of the model. Two feature

which is analogous to the result in the polyhedral convex case considered in
arXiv:1507.00228. In practice, however, one can only compute approximate
solutions in the (bounded or self-bounded) convex case, which solve the problem
up to a given error tolerance. We will show that for approximate solutions a
similar connection can be proven, but the tolerance level needs to be adjusted.
That is, an approximate solution of the convex projection solves the
multi-objective problem only with an increased error. Similarly, an approximate
solution of the multi-objective problem solves the convex projection with an
increased error. In both cases the tolerance is increased proportionally to a
multiplier. These multipliers are deduced and shown to be sharp. These results
allow to compute approximate solutions to a convex projection problem by
computing approximate solutions to the corresponding multi-objective convex

task. Addressing this task is necessary to the automatic recommendation of
appropriate articles to readers with different comprehension abilities, and it
further benefits education systems, web information systems, and digital
libraries. Current methods for assessing readability employ empirical measures
or statistical learning techniques that are limited by their ability to
characterize complex patterns such as article structures and semantic meanings
of sentences. In this paper, we propose a new and comprehensive framework which
uses a hierarchical self-attention model to analyze document readability. In
this model, measurements of sentence-level difficulty are captured along with
the semantic meanings of each sentence. Additionally, the sentence-level
features are incorporated to characterize the overall readability of an article
with consideration of article structures. We evaluate our proposed approach on
three widely-used benchmark datasets against several strong baseline
approaches. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on estimating the readability for various web
articles and literature.

systems. This paper deals with a two-person zero-sum game for semi-Markov
processes. We focus on the expected discounted payoff criterion with
state-action-dependent discount factors. The state and action spaces are both
Polish spaces, and the payoff function is $\omega$-bounded. We first construct
a fairly general model of semi-Markov games under a given semi-Markov kernel
and a pair of strategies. Next, based on the standard regularity condition and
the continuity-compactness condition for semi-Markov games, we derive a ""drift
condition"" on the semi-Markov kernel and suppose that the discount factors have
a positive lower bound, under which the existence of the value function and a
pair of optimal stationary strategies of our semi-Markov game are proved by
using the Shapley equation. Moreover, when the state and action spaces are both
finite, a value iteration-type algorithm for computing the value function and
$\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium of the game is developed. The convergence of the
algorithm is also proved. Finally, we conduct numerical examples to demonstrate
our main results.

the proper development of the fetus. Current fetal heart monitoring techniques

the fetal ECG from the mother's ECG during pregnancy. This approach has the
advantage of being a reliable and non-invasive technique. For this aim, we
propose in this paper a wavelet/multi-wavelet method allowing to extract
perfectly the feta ECG parameters from the abdominal mother ECG. The method is
essentially due to the exploitation of Clifford wavelets as recent variants in
the field. We prove that these wavelets are more efficient and performing
against classical ones. The experimental results are therefore due to two basic
classes of wavelets and multi-wavelets. A first-class is the classical Haar
Schauder, and a second one is due to Clifford valued wavelets and
multi-wavelets. These results showed that wavelets/multiwavelets are already
good bases for the FECG processing, provided that Clifford ones are the best.

the data and parameters, and the form of this model and the inference and
prediction mechanisms are specified via de Finetti's representation. In
general, such a formulation is not robust to model mis-specification of its
component parts. An alternative approach is to draw inference based on loss
functions, where the quantity of interest is defined as a minimizer of some
expected loss, and to construct posterior distributions based on the loss-based
formulation; this strategy underpins the construction of the Gibbs posterior.
We develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach; specifically, we generalize the
Bayesian bootstrap, and specify a Dirichlet process model for the distribution
of the observables. We implement this using direct prior-to-posterior
calculations, but also using predictive sampling. We also study the assessment
of posterior validity for non-standard Bayesian calculations, and provide an
efficient way to calibrate the scaling parameter in the Gibbs posterior so that
it can achieve the desired coverage rate. We show that the developed
non-standard Bayesian updating procedures yield valid posterior distributions
in terms of consistency and asymptotic normality under model mis-specification.
Simulation studies show that the proposed methods can recover the true value of
the parameter efficiently and achieve frequentist coverage even when the sample
size is small. Finally, we apply our methods to evaluate the causal impact of
speed cameras on traffic collisions in England.

be used to demonstrate that the vertical square function operator $$ Sf(x) :=

there are extreme cases where OMA achieves a slightly greater throughput than

frequency dependent rheological parameters of a linear viscoelastic fluid over
five decades of frequency in a single shot, hitherto not achieved using active

embedded in a fluid medium with a combination of a square wave - which is by
definition a superposition of odd sinusoidal harmonics - and a linear
superposition of multiple sinusoids at a wideband frequency range, with
complete control over the amplitude, frequency and relative phase of the
modulating signals. For the latter, we selectively excite the particle by
larger amplitudes at high frequencies where the particle response is low,
thereby enabling wideband active microrheology with large signal-to-noise. This
mitigates the principal issue associated with conventional active microrheology
- which is low bandwidth - and also renders our method better in terms of
signal to noise, and faster compared to passive microrheology. We determine the
complex viscoelastic parameters of the fluid by extracting the phase response
(relative to input excitation) of the probe from the experimentally recorded
time series data of the probe displacement, and employing well-known
theoretical correlations thereafter. We test the efficacy of our method by
studying a linear viscoelastic media (polyacrylamide-water solution) at
different concentrations, and find good agreement of the measured fluid

derivations and numerical calculations on toy-model potentials, we show that
two different estimators built upon PIMD correlation functions fully
characterize the phonon spectra and the anharmonicity strength. The first
estimator is associated with force-force quantum correlators and gives access
to the fundamental frequencies and thermodynamic properties of the quantum

correlators and probes the lowest-energy phonon excitations with high accuracy.
We also prove that the use of generalized eigenvalue equations, in place of the
standard normal mode equations, leads to a significant speed-up in the PIMD
phonon calculations, both in terms of faster convergence rate and smaller
time-step bias. Within this framework, using ab initio PIMD simulations, we
compute phonon dispersions of diamond and of the high-pressure I41/amd phase of

training ML models using bad data, research and industrial practice suggest
incorporating a data validation process and tool in ML system development
process.
  Aim: The study investigates the adoption of a data validation process and
tool in industrial ML projects. The data validation process demands significant
engineering resources for tool development and maintenance. Thus, it is
important to identify the best practices for their adoption especially by
development teams that are in the early phases of deploying ML-enabled software
systems.
  Method: Action research was conducted at a large-software intensive
organization in telecommunications, specifically within the analytics R\&D
organization for an ML use case of classifying faults from returned hardware
telecommunication devices.
  Results: Based on the evaluation results and learning from our action
research, we identified three best practices, three benefits, and two barriers
to adopting the data validation process and tool in ML projects. We also
propose a data validation framework (DVF) for systematizing the adoption of a
data validation process.
  Conclusions: The results show that adopting a data validation process and
tool in ML projects is an effective approach of testing ML-enabled software
systems. It requires having an overview of the level of data (feature, dataset,

scaled in $N^{-1/2}.$ This particular scaling implies that the limit of the
empirical measures of the system is random, describing the conditional

$\mu(J)$-rheology have become increasingly popular for closures of two-phase
flow modeling. However, these frameworks have been derived for monodisperse
particles. We aim to extend these considerations to sediment transport modeling
by using a more realistic sediment composition. We investigate the rheological
behavior of sheared sediment beds composed of polydisperse spherical particles
in a laminar Couette-type shear flow. The sediment beds consist of particles
with a diameter size ratio of up to ten, which corresponds to grains ranging
from fine to coarse sand. The data was generated using fully coupled, grain
resolved direct numerical simulations using a combined lattice Boltzmann -
discrete element method. These highly-resolved data yield detailed
depth-resolved profiles of the relevant physical quantities that determine the
rheology, i.e., the local shear rate of the fluid, particle volume fraction,
total shear, and granular pressure. A comparison against experimental data
shows excellent agreement for the monodisperse case. We improve upon the
parameterization of the $\mu(J)$-rheology by expressing its empirically derived
parameters as a function of the maximum particle volume fraction. Furthermore,
we extend these considerations by exploring the creeping regime for viscous
numbers much lower than used by previous studies to calibrate these
correlations. Considering the low viscous numbers of our data, we found that
the friction coefficient governing the quasi-static state in the creeping
regime tends to a finite value for vanishing shear, which decreases the
critical friction coefficient by a factor of three for all cases investigated.

self-adaptive systems. Machine learning has been used for a variety of reasons,
ranging from learning a model of the environment of a system during operation
to filtering large sets of possible configurations before analysing them. While
a body of work on the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems exists,
there is currently no systematic overview of this area. Such overview is
important for researchers to understand the state of the art and direct future
research efforts. This paper reports the results of a systematic literature
review that aims at providing such an overview. We focus on self-adaptive
systems that are based on a traditional Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute feedback
loop (MAPE). The research questions are centred on the problems that motivate
the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems, the key engineering
aspects of learning in self-adaptation, and open challenges. The search
resulted in 6709 papers, of which 109 were retained for data collection.
Analysis of the collected data shows that machine learning is mostly used for
updating adaptation rules and policies to improve system qualities, and
managing resources to better balance qualities and resources. These problems
are primarily solved using supervised and interactive learning with
classification, regression and reinforcement learning as the dominant methods.
Surprisingly, unsupervised learning that naturally fits automation is only
applied in a small number of studies. Key open challenges in this area include
the performance of learning, managing the effects of learning, and dealing with
more complex types of goals. From the insights derived from this systematic
literature review we outline an initial design process for applying machine
learning in self-adaptive systems that are based on MAPE feedback loops.

assumption that the gauge coupling smoothly evolves during a quasi-de Sitter
phase and then flattens out in the radiation epoch by always remaining
perturbative. In the plane defined by the strength of the anomalous
interactions and by the rate of evolution of the gauge coupling the actual
weight of the pseudoscalar interactions turns out to be always rather modest if
major deviations from the homogeneity are to be avoided during the inflationary

absence of anomalous contributions, an approximate duality symmetry constrains
the late-time form of the hypermagnetic power spectra. Since the hypermagnetic
gyrotropy associated with the modes reentering prior to the phase transition
must be released into fermions later on, the portions of the parameter space
where the obtained baryon asymmetry is close to the observed value are the most
relevant for the present ends. For the same range of parameters the magnetic

$\bar{B}^0\to D^{+}K^-$ and $\bar{B}_{s}^0\to D_{s}^{+}\pi^-$, both of which

even reach 4-5$\sigma$. Here we exploit possible new-physics effects in these
class-I non-leptonic $B$-meson decays within the framework of QCD
factorization. Firstly, we perform a model-independent analysis of the effects
from twenty linearly independent four-quark operators that can contribute,
either directly or through operator mixing, to the quark-level $b\to c\bar{u}
d(s)$ transitions. It is found that, under the combined constraints from the
current experimental data, the deviations observed could be well explained at
the $1\sigma$ level by the new-physics four-quark operators with
$\gamma^{\mu}(1-\gamma_5)\otimes\gamma_{\mu} (1-\gamma_5)$ structure, and also
at the $2\sigma$ level by the operators with $(1+\gamma_5)\otimes(1-\gamma_5)$
and $(1+\gamma_5)\otimes(1+\gamma_5)$ structures. However, the new-physics
four-quark operators with other Dirac structures fail to provide a consistent
interpretation, even at the $2\sigma$ level. Then, as two specific examples of
model-dependent considerations, we discuss the case where the new-physics
four-quark operators are generated by either a colorless charged gauge boson or
a colorless charged scalar, with their masses fixed both at the $1$~TeV.
Constraints on the effective coefficients describing the couplings of these
mediators to the relevant quarks are obtained by fitting to the current

magnetostriction measurements were performed in both pulsed and steady high
magnetic fields to investigate the magnetocaloric properties of Heusler alloys
Ni50-xCoxMn31.5Ga18.5 (x = 9 and 9.7). From direct MCE measurements for
Ni41Co9Mn31.5Ga18.5 up to 56 T, a steep temperature drop was observed for
magnetic-field-induced martensitic transformation (MFIMT), designated as
inverse MCE. Remarkably, this inverse MCE is apparent not only with MFIMT, but
also in the magnetic-field-induced austenite phase. Specific heat measurements
under steady high magnetic fields revealed that the magnetic field variation of
the electronic entropy plays a dominant role in the unconventional
magnetocaloric properties of these materials. First-principles based
calculations performed for Ni41Co9Mn31.5Ga18.5 and Ni45Co5Mn36.7In13.3 revealed
that the magnetic-field-induced austenite phase of Ni41Co9Mn31.5Ga18.5 is more
unstable than that of Ni45Co5Mn36.7In13.3 and that it is sensitive to slight
tetragonal distortion. We conclude that the inverse MCE in the
magnetic-field-induced austenite phase is realized by marked change in the
electronic entropy through tetragonal distortion induced by the externally
applied magnetic field.

the transition density, chosen to be equal to the saturation density
$\rho_t\sim \rho_0$. We examine numerically the combined effect of the stiff
causal equation of state and of the sound speed on the maximum mass of static
neutron stars, in the context of Jordan frame of $f(R)$ gravity. This yields
the most extreme upper bound for neutron star masses in the context of extended
gravity. As we will evince for the case of $R^2$ model, the upper causal mass
limit lies within, but not deeply in, the mass-gap region, and is marginally
the same with the general relativistic causal maximum mass, indicating that the
$\sim 3M_{\odot}$ general relativistic limit is respected. In view of the
modified gravity perspective for the secondary component of the GW190814 event,
we also discuss the strange star possibility. Using several well established
facts for neutron star physics and the Occam's razor approach, although the
strange star is exciting, for the moment, it remains a possibility for
describing the secondary component of GW190814. We underpin the fact that the
secondary component of the compact binary GW190814 is probably a neutron star,
a black hole or even a rapidly rotating neutron star, but not a strange star.
We also discuss, in general, the potential role of the extended gravity
description for the binary merging.

combined pre-/post-capillary PH (Cpc-PH), diagnosed by an increase in pulmonary
vascular resistance and associated with a dramatic increase in mortality. We
hypothesize that altered mechanical forces and subsequent vasoactive signaling
in the pulmonary capillary bed drive the transition from Ipc-PH to Cpc-PH.
However, even in a healthy pulmonary circulation, the mechanical forces in the
smallest vessels (the arterioles, venules, and capillary bed) have not been
quantitatively defined. This study is the first to examine this question via a
computational fluid dynamics model of the human pulmonary arteries, veins,
arterioles, and venules. Using this model we predict temporal and spatial
dynamics of cyclic stretch and wall shear stress. In the large vessels,
numerical simulations show that shear stress increases coincides with larger
flow and pressure. In the microvasculature, we found that as vessel radius
decreases, shear stress increases and flow decreases. In arterioles, this
corresponds with lower pressures; however, the venules and smaller veins have
higher pressure than larger veins. Our model provides predictions for pressure,
flow, shear stress, and cyclic stretch that provides a way to analyze and
investigate hypotheses related to disease progression in the pulmonary

them vulnerable to potential attacks. In this paper, we present a vulnerability

assess implementations of the PRNGs in an automated manner without the source
code requirement. Through reverse engineering, \sysname identifies the apps
using SMS OTP and triggers each app's login functionality to retrieve OTP

nature (or ratios between them) must belong to very small intervals in order
for life to exist, has been debated by scientists for several decades. Several
criticisms have emerged concerning probabilistic measurement of life-permitting
intervals. Herein, a Bayesian statistical approach is used to assign an upper
bound for the probability of tuning, which is invariant with respect to change
of physical units, and under certain assumptions it is small whenever the
life-permitting interval is small on a relative scale. The computation of the
upper bound of the tuning probability is achieved by first assuming that the
prior is chosen by the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt). The unknown
parameters of this MaxEnt distribution are then handled in such a way that the
weak anthropic principle is not violated. The MaxEnt assumption is ""maximally
noncommittal with regard to missing information."" This approach is sufficiently
general to be applied to constants of current cosmological models, or to other
constants possibly under different models. Application of the MaxEnt model
reveals, for example, that the ratio of the universal gravitational constant to
the square of the Hubble constant is finely tuned in some cases, whereas the
amplitude of primordial fluctuations is not.

{S}afety-{A}ware {Int}elligent {ACC} system (SAINT-ACC) that is designed to
achieve simultaneous optimization of traffic efficiency, driving safety, and
driving comfort through dynamic adaptation of the inter-vehicle gap based on
deep reinforcement learning (RL). A novel dual RL agent-based approach is
developed to seek and adapt the optimal balance between traffic efficiency and
driving safety/comfort by effectively controlling the driving safety model
parameters and inter-vehicle gap based on macroscopic and microscopic traffic
information collected from dynamically changing and complex traffic
environments. Results obtained through over 12,000 simulation runs with varying
traffic scenarios and penetration rates demonstrate that SAINT-ACC
significantly enhances traffic flow, driving safety and comfort compared with a
state-of-the-art approach.

the scarcity of bandwidth in an MEC enabled IoT network, our objective is to
optimize bandwidth allocation for a group of NB-IoT devices in a way that the
group can work collaboratively to maximize their overall utility. To this end,
we design an optimal distributed algorithm and use simulations to demonstrate
its efficacy to effectively manage various IoT data streams in a fully
distributed framework.

way of unifying the classical formulas for the forces of the Coulomb's law of
electrostatic interaction ($F_C$) and the Newton's law of universal gravitation
$(F_G)$. In this approach, these two forces are of the same nature and are
ascribed to the interaction between two membranes that oscillate according to
different curvature functions with the same spatial period $\xi\pi/k$ where
$\xi$ is a dimensionless parameter and $k$ a wave number. Both curvature
functions are solutions of the classical wave equation with wavelength given by
the de Broglie relation. This new formula still keeps itself as the inverse
square law, and it is like $F_C$ when the dimensionless parameter $\xi =274$
and like $F_G$ when $\xi = 1.14198$x$10^{45}$. It was found that the values of
the parameter $\xi$ quantize the formula from which $F_C$ and $F_G$ are
obtained as particular cases.
