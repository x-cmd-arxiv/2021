  Differentiable Architecture Search",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The integration of behavioral phenomena into mechanistic models of cognitive
function is a fundamental staple of cognitive science. Yet, researchers are
beginning to accumulate increasing amounts of data without having the temporal
or monetary resources to integrate these data into scientific theories. We seek
to overcome these limitations by incorporating existing machine learning
techniques into an open-source pipeline for the automated construction of
quantitative models. This pipeline leverages the use of neural architecture
search to automate the discovery of interpretable model architectures, and
automatic differentiation to automate the fitting of model parameters to data.
We evaluate the utility of these methods based on their ability to recover
quantitative models of human information processing from synthetic data. We
find that these methods are capable of recovering basic quantitative motifs
from models of psychophysics, learning and decision making. We also highlight
weaknesses of this framework and discuss future directions for their
mitigation.

Logspace such that it gives nonzero weights to all the cycles in $G$. This
class of graphs subsumes almost all classes of graphs for which such a weight
function is known to be constructed in Logspace. As a consequence, we obtain
that for the class of $H$-minor free graphs where $H$ is a single crossing
graph, reachability can be solved in UL, and bipartite maximum matching can be
solved in SPL, which are small subclasses of the parallel complexity class NC.
In the restrictive case of bipartite graphs, our maximum matching result
improves upon the recent result of Eppstein and Vazirani, where they show an NC
bound for constructing perfect matching in general single crossing minor free

the neural networks favoring simple linear behaviors in-between training
samples. Performing mixup for transfer learning with pre-trained models however
is not that simple, a high capacity pre-trained model with a large
fully-connected (FC) layer could easily overfit to the target dataset even with
samples-to-labels mixed up. In this work, we propose SMILE - Self-Distilled
Mixup for EffIcient Transfer LEarning. With mixed images as inputs, SMILE
regularizes the outputs of CNN feature extractors to learn from the mixed
feature vectors of inputs (sample-to-feature mixup), in addition to the mixed
labels. Specifically, SMILE incorporates a mean teacher, inherited from the
pre-trained model, to provide the feature vectors of input samples in a
self-distilling fashion, and mixes up the feature vectors accordingly via a
novel triplet regularizer. The triple regularizer balances the mixup effects in
both feature and label spaces while bounding the linearity in-between samples
for pre-training tasks. Extensive experiments have been done to verify the
performance improvement made by SMILE, in comparisons with a wide spectrum of
transfer learning algorithms, including fine-tuning, L2-SP, DELTA, and RIFLE,
even with mixup strategies combined. Ablation studies show that the vanilla
sample-to-label mixup strategies could marginally increase the linearity
in-between training samples but lack of generalizability, while SMILE
significantly improve the mixup effects in both label and feature spaces with
both training and testing datasets. The empirical observations backup our
design intuition and purposes.

pretraining provides a grounding that can improve text processing accuracy. We
propose possible strategies in this respect. A first type of strategy, referred
to as {\it transferred grounding} consists in applying multimodal models to
text-only tasks using a placeholder to replace image input. The second one,
which we call {\it associative grounding}, harnesses image retrieval to match
texts with related images during both pretraining and text-only downstream

domain-matched interfaces with the lowest mismatch. Subsequently, surface
matching is conducted by Bayesian optimization to find the optimal interfacial
distance and in-plane registry between the substrate and film. For the
objective function, a geometric score function is proposed, based on the
overlap and empty space between atomic spheres at the interface. The score
function reproduces the results of density functional theory (DFT) at a
fraction of the computational cost. The optimized interfaces are pre-ranked
using a score function based on the similarity of the atomic environment at the
interface to the bulk environment. Final ranking of the top candidate
structures is performed with DFT. Ogre streamlines DFT calculations of
interface energies and electronic properties by automating the construction of

answer is still desired for many applications, however. Hence, looking for a
GCD of so-called approximate polynomials where this term explicitly denotes
small uncertainties in the coefficients has received significant attention in
the field of hybrid symbolic-numeric computation. In this paper we give an
algorithm, based on one of Victor Ya. Pan, to find an approximate GCD for a
pair of approximate polynomials given in a Lagrange basis. More precisely, we
suppose that these polynomials are given by their approximate values at
distinct known points. We first find each of their roots by using a Lagrange
basis companion matrix for each polynomial, cluster the roots of each
polynomial to identify multiple roots, and then ""marry"" the two polynomials to
find their GCD. At no point do we change to the monomial basis, thus preserving
the good conditioning properties of the original Lagrange basis. We discuss
advantages and drawbacks of this method. The computational cost is dominated by
the rootfinding step; unless special-purpose eigenvalue algorithms are used,
the cost is cubic in the degrees of the polynomials. In principle, this cost
could be reduced but we do not do so here.

using an equation that projects LiDAR points onto an image, and a method of
fusion between LiDAR and vision tracked data. Thus, the newly proposed method
was effective through the results of detecting closest in-path vehicle (CIPV)

autonomous emergency braking (AEB) test protocol using the result of fusion,
AEB performance is improved through improved cognitive performance than when

  Aims. We aim to search for the 12.2 GHz methanol emission in 6.7 GHz methanol
masers that might have gone undetected in previous surveys of northern sky
HMYSOs, mainly due to their variability. Contemporaneous observations of both
transitions are used to refine the flux density ratio and examine the physical
parameters.
  Methods. We observed a sample of 153 sites of 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission
in the 12.2 GHz methanol line with the Torun 32 m radio telescope, using the
newly built X-band receiver.
  Results. The 12.2 GHz methanol maser emission was detected in 36 HMYSOs, with
4 of them detected for the first time. The 6.7 GHz to 12.2 GHz flux density
ratio for spectral features of the contemporaneously observed sources has a
median value of 5.1, which is in agreement with earlier reports. The ratio
differs significantly among the sources and for the periodic source
G107.298+5.639 specifically, the ratio is weakly recurrent from cycle to cycle,
but it generally reaches a minimum around the flare peak. This is consistent
with the stochastic maser process, where small variations in the physical
parameters along the maser path can significantly affect the ratio. A
comparison of our data with historical results (from about ten years ago)
implies significant (> 50%) variability for about 47% and 14% at 12.2 GHz and
6.7 GHz, respectively. This difference can be explained via the standard model
of methanol masers.

renormalization of 4-point functions containing insertions of stress-energy
tensors (4T), in conformal field theories in four spacetime dimensions with the
goal of identifying the structure of the anomaly action. We focus on a
separation of the correlator into its transverse/traceless and longitudinal
components, applied to the trace and conservation Ward identities (WI) in
momentum space. These are sufficient to identify, from their hierarchical
structure, the anomaly contribution, without the need to proceed with a
complete determination of all of its independent form factors. Renormalization
induces sequential bilinear graviton-scalar mixings on single, double and
multiple trace terms, corresponding to $R\square^{-1}$ interactions of the
scalar curvature, with intermediate virtual massless exchanges. These
dilaton-like terms couple to the conformal anomaly, as for the chiral anomalous
WIs. We show that at 4T level a new traceless component appears after
renormalization. We comment on future extensions of this result to more general
backgrounds, with possible applications to non local cosmologies.

approaches. The Pfaffian states are prime examples of topological ($p$-wave)

quasiparticles. Here we focus on conditions for their realization and
competition among them at half-integer filling factors. Using the Dirac
composite fermion description, in the presence of a mass term, we study the
influence of Landau level mixing in selecting a particular Pfaffian state.
While Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian are selected when Landau level mixing is not
strong, and can be taken into account perturbatively, the PH Pfaffian state
requires non-perturbative inclusion of at least two Landau levels. Our
findings, for small Landau level mixing, are in accordance with numerical
investigations in the literature, and call for a non-perturbative approach in
the search for PH Pfaffian correlations. We demonstrated that a method based on
the Chern-Simons field-theoretical approach can be used to generate
characteristic interaction pseudo-potentials for Pfaffian paired states.

Differences with the predictions of the simplest model, usually found in the

quantum properties, as highlighted by a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect

external control of the band topology. Here we demonstrate a
magnetic-field-induced switching of band topology in $\alpha{\mathrm{-EuP}}_3$,
a magnetic semimetal with a layered crystal structure derived from black
phosphorus. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the single
mirror plane of the monoclinic structure, a giant AHE signal abruptly emerges
at a certain threshold magnetization value, giving rise to a prominently large
anomalous Hall angle of $\left|\Theta_{\mathrm{AHE}}\right| \sim 20^{\circ}$.
When the magnetic field is applied along the inter-layer direction, which
breaks the mirror symmetry, the system shows a pronounced negative longitudinal
magnetoresistance. On the basis of electronic structure calculations and
symmetry considerations, these anomalous magneto-transport properties can be
considered as manifestations of two distinct topological phases: topological
nodal-line and Weyl semimetals, respectively. Notably, the nodal-line structure
is composed of bands with the same spin character and spans a wide energy range
around the Fermi level. These topological phases are stabilized via the
exchange coupling between localized Eu-4$f$ moments and mobile carriers
conducting through the phosphorus layers. Our findings provide a realistic

multiplicatively scaled down by the pacing multiplier. This naturally gives
rise to a game in which each bidder strategically selects a multiplier. The

$C_{z_i} = P_{\mathcal{Q}} M_{z_i}|_{\mathcal{Q}}$, $i=1, \ldots, n$. Then

invariant subspaces with factorizations of inner functions. All results work

transmission, in quantum networks (QN) is a key and timely challenge for
developing efficient quantum communication. Traditional comprehension based on
classical percolation assumes a necessary condition for successful entanglement
transmission between any two infinitely distant nodes: they must be connected
by at least a path of perfectly entangled states (singlets). Here, we relax
this condition by explicitly showing that one can focus not on optimally
converting singlets but on establishing concurrence -- a key measure of
bipartite entanglement. We thereby introduce a new statistical theory,
concurrence percolation theory (ConPT), remotely analogous to classical
percolation but fundamentally different, built by generalizing bond percolation
in terms of ""sponge-crossing"" paths instead of clusters. Inspired by resistance
network analysis, we determine the path connectivity by series/parallel rules
and approximate higher-order rules via star-mesh transforms. Interestingly, we
find that the entanglement transmission threshold predicted by ConPT is lower
than the known classical-percolation-based results and is readily achievable on
any series-parallel networks such as the Bethe lattice. ConPT promotes our
understanding of how well quantum communication can be further systematically
improved versus classical statistical predictions under the limitation of QN
locality -- a ""quantum advantage"" that is more general and efficient than
expected. ConPT also shows a percolation-like universal critical behavior
derived by finite-size analysis on the Bethe lattice and regular
two-dimensional lattices, offering new perspectives for a theory of criticality
in entanglement statistics.

however limited, as classical computers are often insufficient to handle the
intricate interplay of the Pauli principle with strong interactions. Quantum
simulators based on ultracold fermionic atoms instead directly realize
paradigmatic Fermi systems, albeit in ""analog"" fashion, without coherent
control of individual fermions. Digital qubit-based quantum computation of
fermion models, on the other hand, faces significant challenges in implementing
fermionic anti-symmetrization, calling for an architecture that natively
employs fermions as the fundamental unit. Here we demonstrate a robust quantum
register composed of hundreds of fermionic atom pairs trapped in an optical
lattice. With each fermion pair forming a spin-singlet, the qubit is realized
as a set of near-degenerate, symmetry-protected two-particle wavefunctions
describing common and relative motion. Degeneracy is lifted by the atomic
recoil energy, only dependent on mass and lattice wavelength, thereby rendering
two-fermion motional qubits insensitive against noise of the confining
potential. We observe quantum coherence beyond ten seconds. Universal control
is provided by modulating interactions between the atoms. Via state-dependent,
coherent conversion of free atom pairs into tightly bound molecules, we tune
the speed of motional entanglement over three orders of magnitude, yielding
$10^4$ Ramsey oscillations within the coherence time. For site-resolved
motional state readout, fermion pairs are coherently split into a double well,
creating entangled Bell pairs. The methods presented here open the door towards
fully programmable quantum simulation and digital quantum computation based on

unforgeability for both classical and quantum constructions allowing us for the
first time to present a complete quantum cryptanalysis framework for

orthogonal to previously queried messages are considered to be forgeries. In
particular, we present a non-trivial attack if any overlap between the forged
message and previously queried ones is allowed. We further show that
deterministic constructions can only achieve the weaker notion of
unforgeability, that is selective unforgeability, against such restricted
adversaries, but that selective unforgeability breaks if general quantum
adversaries (capable of general superposition attacks) are considered. On the

tops of reconnecting magnetic flux tubes toward the lower atmosphere. Over the
course of the electrons' transport, a co-spatial counter-streaming return
current is induced, thereby balancing the current density. In response to the
return current electric field, a fraction of the ambient electrons will be
accelerated into the runaway regime. However, models describing the accelerated
electron beam/return-current system have generally failed to take these
suprathermal runaway electrons into account self-consistently. We develop a
model in which an accelerated electron beam drives a steady-state, sub-Dreicer
co-spatial return-current electric field, which locally balances the direct
beam current and freely accelerates a fraction of background (return-current)
electrons. The model is self-consistent, i.e., the electric field induced by
the co-evolution of the direct beam and the runaway current is considered. We
find that (1) the return current electric field can return a significant number
of suprathermal electrons to the acceleration region, where they can be further
accelerated to higher energies, runaway electrons can be a few tens of percent
of the return current flux returning to the nonthermal beam's acceleration
region, (2) the energy gain of the suprathermal electrons can be up to

defined average distance between any two nodes is proportional to the logarithm
of the number of nodes, $N$. In this paper, we present a novel derivation of
the small-world property for Gilbert-Erd\""os-Renyi random networks. We employ a
mean field approximation that permits the analytic derivation of the
distribution of shortest paths that exhibits logarithmic scaling away from the
phase transition, inferable via a suitably interpreted order parameter. We
begin by framing the problem in generality with a formal generating functional
for undirected weighted random graphs with arbitrary disorder, recovering the
result that the free energy associated with an ensemble of Gilbert graphs
corresponds to a system of non-interacting fermions identified with the edge
states. We then present a mean field solution for this model and extend it to
more general realizations of network randomness. For a two family class of
stochastic block models that we refer to as dimorphic networks, which allow for
links within the different families to be drawn from two independent discrete
probability distributions, we find the mean field approximation maps onto a
spin chain combinatorial problem and again yields useful approximate analytic
expressions for mean path lengths. Dimorophic networks exhibit a richer phase
structure, where distinct small world regimes separate in analogy to the
spinodal decomposition of a fluid. We find that is it possible to induce small
world behavior in sub-networks that by themselves would not be in the
small-world regime.

experimentally identifying the truly effective design is difficult in

systematically studying weighting strategies of various pair-wise loss

the weighting mechanisms by decomposing the pair-wise functions, and study
positive and negative weights separately using direct weight assignment. This
allows us to study various weighting functions deeply and systematically via
weight curves, and identify a number of meaningful, comprehensive and
insightful facts, which come up with our key observation on memory-based DML:
it is critical to mine hard negatives and discard easy negatives which are less
informative and redundant, but weighting on positive pairs is not helpful. This
results in an efficient but surprisingly simple rule to design the weighting
scheme, making it significantly different from existing mini-batch based
methods which design various sophisticated loss functions to weight pairs
carefully. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three large-scale
visual retrieval benchmarks, and demonstrate the superiority of memory-based
DML over recent mini-batch based approaches, by using a simple contrastive loss

consideration, such as blur, they are still not effective enough to cover the
diverse degradations of real images. To address this issue, this paper proposes
to design a more complex but practical degradation model that consists of
randomly shuffled blur, downsampling and noise degradations. Specifically, the
blur is approximated by two convolutions with isotropic and anisotropic
Gaussian kernels; the downsampling is randomly chosen from nearest, bilinear
and bicubic interpolations; the noise is synthesized by adding Gaussian noise
with different noise levels, adopting JPEG compression with different quality
factors, and generating processed camera sensor noise via reverse-forward
camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline model and RAW image noise model.
To verify the effectiveness of the new degradation model, we have trained a
deep blind ESRGAN super-resolver and then applied it to super-resolve both
synthetic and real images with diverse degradations. The experimental results
demonstrate that the new degradation model can help to significantly improve
the practicability of deep super-resolvers, thus providing a powerful

entries, and the corresponding Gaussian matrix with independent entries above
the diagonal. Jiang and Li (2015) and Bubeck et al. (2016) showed that these
two matrix ensembles converge in total variation whenever $d/n^3\to \infty$,
and Bubeck et al. (2016) showed this to be sharp. In this paper we aim to
identify the precise threshold for $d$ in terms of $n$ for subsets of Wishart
matrices to converge in total variation to independent Gaussians. It turns out
that the combinatorial structure of the revealed entries, viewed as the
adjacency matrix of a graph $G$, characterizes the distance from fully
independent. Specifically, we show that the threshold for $d$ depends on the
number of various small subgraphs in $G$. So, even when the number of revealed
entries is fixed, the threshold can vary wildly depending on their
configuration. Convergence of masked Wishart to independent Gaussians thus
inherently involves an interplay between both probabilistic and combinatorial
phenomena. Our results determine the sharp threshold for a large family of $G$,

graphs on $n$ vertices behave? This quantity is a random variable, so one can
ask (i) for upper and lower bounds on its typical values, and (ii) for bounds
on how much it varies: what is the width (e.g., standard deviation) of its
distribution?
  On (i) there has been considerable progress over the last 45 years; on (ii),
which is our focus here, remarkably little. One would like both upper and lower
bounds on the width of the distribution, and ideally a description of the
(appropriately scaled) limiting distribution. There is a well known upper bound
of Shamir and Spencer of order $\sqrt{n}$, improved slightly by Alon to
$\sqrt{n}/\log n$, but no non-trivial lower bound was known until 2019, when
the first author proved that the width is at least $n^{1/4-o(1)}$ for
infinitely many $n$, answering a longstanding question of Bollob\'as.
  In this paper we have two main aims: first, we shall prove a much stronger
lower bound on the width. We shall show unconditionally that, for some values
of $n$, the width is at least $n^{1/2-o(1)}$, matching the upper bounds up to
the error term. Moreover, conditional on a recently announced sharper explicit
estimate for the chromatic number, we improve the lower bound to order
$\sqrt{n} \log \log n /\log^3 n$, within a logarithmic factor of the upper
bound.
  Secondly, we will describe a number of conjectures as to what the true
behaviour of the variation in $\chi(G_{n,1/2})$ is, and why. The first form of
this conjecture arises from recent work of Bollob\'as, Heckel, Morris,
Panagiotou, Riordan and Smith. We will also give much more detailed
conjectures, suggesting that the true width, for the worst case $n$, matches
our lower bound up to a constant factor. These conjectures also predict a
Gaussian limiting distribution.

alternative methods, such as unsupervised SR are being explored. To address the
need for non-reference image quality improvement, we designed a novel zero-shot
super-resolution (ZSSR) approach that relies only on the endomicroscopy data to
be processed in a self-supervised manner without the need for ground-truth HR
images. We tailored the proposed pipeline to the idiosyncrasies of
endomicroscopy by introducing both: a physically-motivated Voronoi downscaling
kernel accounting for the endomicroscope's irregular fibre-based sampling
pattern, and realistic noise patterns. We also took advantage of video
sequences to exploit a sequence of images for self-supervised zero-shot image
quality improvement. We run ablation studies to assess our contribution in
regards to the downscaling kernel and noise simulation. We validate our
methodology on both synthetic and original data. Synthetic experiments were
assessed with reference-based IQA, while our results for original images were
evaluated in a user study conducted with both expert and non-expert observers.
The results demonstrated superior performance in image quality of ZSSR
reconstructions in comparison to the baseline method. The ZSSR is also
competitive when compared to supervised single-image SR, especially being the
preferred reconstruction technique by experts.

and in selected modified gravity (MG) structure formation scenarios. As a
test-bed, we employ two popular beyond-GR models: $f(R)$ gravity and the normal
branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) braneworld. We study a range of
simulated halo and galaxy populations and reveal a noticeable MG signal in the
monopole and quadrupole moments of the redshift-space 2PCF, and in the
so-called clustering wedges. However, once expressed in terms of the linear
distortion parameter, $\beta$, the statistical significance of these signals
largely diminishes due to a strong degeneracy between MG-enhanced clustering
and modified tracer bias. To circumvent this, we consider statistics less
dependent on the bias: relative clustering ratios. We generalize the monopole
ratio proposed in earlier work to multipole moments and clustering wedges, and
introduce a new estimator of the $\beta$ parameter. The clustering ratios we
extract foster noticeable differences between MG and GR models, reaching a

on-site disorder term for the basic excitations of the system, and as an
interaction between excitations. The two contributions are of the same order,
and as they compete (one towards localization, the other against it), one does
never enter a truly strong disorder, weak interaction limit, where many-body
localization occurs. Such a mechanism is further clarified in the case of
XY-type constrained models: there, a term which would represent a bona-fide
local quenched disorder term acting on the excitations of the clean model must
be written as a series of non-local terms in the unconstrained variables. Our
observations provide a simple picture to interpret the role of quenched
disorder that could be immediately extended to other constrained models or

classification tasks, with softmax cross-entropy (CE) loss emerging as the
de-facto objective function. The CE loss encourages features of a class to have
a higher projection score on the true class-vector compared to the negative
classes. However, this is a relative constraint and does not explicitly force
different class features to be well-separated. Motivated by the observation
that ground-truth class representations in CE loss are orthogonal (one-hot
encoded vectors), we develop a novel loss function termed `Orthogonal
Projection Loss' (OPL) which imposes orthogonality in the feature space. OPL
augments the properties of CE loss and directly enforces inter-class separation
alongside intra-class clustering in the feature space through orthogonality
constraints on the mini-batch level. As compared to other alternatives of CE,
OPL offers unique advantages e.g., no additional learnable parameters, does not
require careful negative mining and is not sensitive to the batch size. Given
the plug-and-play nature of OPL, we evaluate it on a diverse range of tasks
including image recognition (CIFAR-100), large-scale classification (ImageNet),
domain generalization (PACS) and few-shot learning (miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
tiered-ImageNet and Meta-dataset) and demonstrate its effectiveness across the
board. Furthermore, OPL offers better robustness against practical nuisances
such as adversarial attacks and label noise. Code is available at:

transition. We therefore study the EWPT in the Standard Model Effective Field
Theory (SMEFT) including dimension-six operators. A first-order EWPT has
previously been shown to be possible in the SMEFT. Phenomenology studies have
focused on scenarios with a tree-level barrier between minima, which requires a
negative Higgs quartic coupling and a new physics scale low enough to raise
questions about the validity of the EFT approach. In this work we stress that a
first-order EWPT is also possible when the barrier between minima is generated
radiatively, the quartic coupling is positive, the scale of new physics is
higher, and there is good agreement with experimental bounds. Our calculation
is done in a consistent, gauge-invariant way, and we carefully analyze the
scaling of parameters necessary to generate a barrier in the potential. We
perform a global fit in the relevant parameter space and explicitly find the

autonomous systems, but is challenging due to the complex agent interaction and
the uncertainty in each agent's future behavior. Forecasting multi-agent
trajectories requires modeling two key dimensions: (1) time dimension, where we
model the influence of past agent states over future states; (2) social
dimension, where we model how the state of each agent affects others. Most
prior methods model these two dimensions separately, e.g., first using a
temporal model to summarize features over time for each agent independently and
then modeling the interaction of the summarized features with a social model.
This approach is suboptimal since independent feature encoding over either the
time or social dimension can result in a loss of information. Instead, we would
prefer a method that allows an agent's state at one time to directly affect
another agent's state at a future time. To this end, we propose a new
Transformer, AgentFormer, that jointly models the time and social dimensions.
The model leverages a sequence representation of multi-agent trajectories by
flattening trajectory features across time and agents. Since standard attention
operations disregard the agent identity of each element in the sequence,
AgentFormer uses a novel agent-aware attention mechanism that preserves agent
identities by attending to elements of the same agent differently than elements
of other agents. Based on AgentFormer, we propose a stochastic multi-agent
trajectory prediction model that can attend to features of any agent at any
previous timestep when inferring an agent's future position. The latent intent
of all agents is also jointly modeled, allowing the stochasticity in one
agent's behavior to affect other agents. Our method substantially improves the
state of the art on well-established pedestrian and autonomous driving
datasets.

FPS, which is over 3000 times faster than conventional NeRFs. We do so without
sacrificing quality while preserving the ability of NeRFs to perform
free-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependent

PlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities,
we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions.
Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical
harmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as an input
to the neural network. Furthermore, we show that PlenOctrees can be directly
optimized to further minimize the reconstruction loss, which leads to equal or
better quality compared to competing methods. Moreover, this octree
optimization step can be used to reduce the training time, as we no longer need

around the house that can be used as tools to assist with transporting objects
efficiently. To complete the task, an embodied agent must plan a sequence of

realistic physical constraints. We build this benchmark challenge using the
ThreeDWorld simulation: a virtual 3D environment where all objects respond to

Experimental results suggest that: 1) a pure RL model struggles on this

still far from solving this task. We anticipate that this benchmark will
empower researchers to develop more intelligent physics-driven robots for the

in estimation, and they also focused on parametric estimation of bridge
functions. Instead, we provide a new identification strategy that avoids the

based on minimax learning formulations. These estimators accommodate general
function classes such as Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and neural networks.
We study finite-sample convergence results both for estimating bridge functions

adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the
two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the
high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these
differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is
computed with \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme
brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to
non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection.
This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales
and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These
qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision
tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and
dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP
on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its
performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7

naturally support pluralistic completion. Recently, transformers demonstrate
their power in modeling the long-term relationship and generating diverse
results, but their computation complexity is quadratic to input length, thus
hampering the application in processing high-resolution images. This paper
brings the best of both worlds to pluralistic image completion: appearance
prior reconstruction with transformer and texture replenishment with CNN. The
former transformer recovers pluralistic coherent structures together with some
coarse textures, while the latter CNN enhances the local texture details of
coarse priors guided by the high-resolution masked images. The proposed method
vastly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of three aspects: 1) large

methods; 2) better diversity and higher fidelity for pluralistic completion; 3)
exceptional generalization ability on large masks and generic dataset, like

tens of thousands of binary neutron stars (BNSs) out to cosmological distances
($z>2$), beyond the peak of the star formation rate (SFR), or ""cosmic noon."" At
these distances, it will be challenging to measure the sources' redshifts by
observing electromagnetic (EM) counterparts or statistically marginalizing over
a galaxy catalog. In the absence of an EM counterpart or galaxy catalog, Ding

be used to infer parameters in a $w$CDM cosmology. We argue that in the BNS
case, the redshift distribution will be measured by independent observations of
short gamma ray bursts (GRBs), kilonovae, and known BNS host galaxies. We show
that, in addition to measuring the background cosmology, this method can
constrain the effects of dark energy on modified GW propagation. We consider
the simple case in which the BNS rate is \textit{a priori} known to follow the

$H_0$ and $\Omega_M$, this method may enable a 5\% measurement of the dark
energy equation of state parameter. Fixing the background cosmology and probing
modified GW propagation, the running of the Planck mass parameter $c_M$ may be

quantum thermodynamics. In conventional thermodynamics, a system of interest
and an environment exchange quantities -- energy, particles, electric charge,
etc. -- that are globally conserved and are represented by Hermitian operators.
These operators were implicitly assumed to commute with each other, until a few
years ago. Freeing the operators to fail to commute has enabled many
theoretical discoveries -- about reference frames, entropy production,
resource-theory models, etc. Little work has bridged these results from
abstract theory to experimental reality. This paper provides a methodology for
building this bridge systematically: We present a prescription for constructing
Hamiltonians that conserve noncommuting quantities globally while transporting
the quantities locally. The Hamiltonians can couple arbitrarily many subsystems
together and can be integrable or nonintegrable. Our Hamiltonians may be
realized physically with superconducting qudits, with ultracold atoms, and with
trapped ions.

(IMBH) in a nuclear star cluster hosting a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and
both a spherical and a flattened disk-like distribution of stellar-mass
objects. We use a direct N-body (phiGPU) and an orbit-averaged (N-ring)
numerical integrator to simulate the orbital evolution of stars and the IMBH.
We find that the IMBH's orbit gradually aligns with the stellar disk if their
mutual initial inclination is less than 90 degree. If it is larger than 90
degree, i.e. counterrotating, the IMBH does not align. Initially, the rate of
orbital reorientation increases linearly with the ratio of the mass of the IMBH
over the SMBH mass and it is orders of magnitude faster than ordinary (i.e.
Chandrasekhar) dynamical friction, particularly for high SMBH masses. The
semimajor axes of the IMBH and the stars are approximately conserved. This
suggests that the alignment is predominantly driven by orbit-averaged
gravitational torques of the stars, a process which may be called resonant
dynamical friction. The stellar disk is warped by the IMBH, and ultimately
increases its thickness. This process may offer a test for the viability of
IMBH candidates in the Galactic Center. Resonant dynamical friction is not
limited to IMBHs; any object much more massive than disk particles may
ultimately align with the disk. This may have implications for the formation
and evolution of black hole disks in dense stellar systems and gravitational
wave source populations for LIGO, VIRGO, KAGRA, and LISA.

dimensional lattice. Due to their non-Abelian nature, besides the position
degree of freedom (DOF), these anyons also have a nonlocal internal DOF, which
can be characterized by a fusion tree. We first consider a pure-reaction
dynamics associated with the internal DOF, which is of intrinsically quantum
origin, with either an ""all-$\tau$"" or ""completely random"" initial fusion tree.
These two fusion trees are unstable and likely stable steady states for the
internal DOF, respectively. We obtain the decay rate of the anyon number for
these two cases exactly. Still using these two initial fusion trees, we study
the full reaction-diffusion dynamics, and find an interesting interplay between
classical and quantum behaviors: These two fusion trees are still respectively
unstable and likely stable steady states of the internal DOF, while the
dynamics of the position DOF can be mapped to a hybrid classical
$A+A\rightarrow 0$ and $A+A\rightarrow A$ reaction-diffuson dynamics, with the
relative reaction rates of these two classical dynamics determined by the state
of the nonlocal internal DOF. In particular, the anyon density at late times
are given by $\rho(t)=\frac{c}{\sqrt{8\pi}}(Dt)^{-\Delta}$, where $D$ is a
non-universal diffusion constant, $\Delta=1/2$ is superuniversal, and $c$ is
universal and can be obtained exactly in terms of the fusion tree structure.
Specifically, $c=\frac{2\varphi}{\varphi+1}$ and
$c=\frac{2(4\varphi+3)}{5(\varphi+1)}$ for the all-$\tau$ and completely random
configuration respectively, where $\varphi=\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$ is the golden
ratio. We also study the two-point correlation functions.

helium shell are a potential explosion mechanism for a Type Ia supernova (SNe
Ia). It comprises a shell detonation and subsequent core detonation. The focus
of our study is on the effect of the progenitor metallicity on the
nucleosynthetic yields. For this, we compute and analyse a set of eleven
different models with varying core and shell masses at four different
metallicities each. This results in a total of 44 models at metallicities
between 0.01$Z_\odot$ and 3$Z_\odot$. Our models show a strong impact of the
metallicity in the high density regime. The presence of $^{22}$Ne causes a
neutron-excess which shifts the production from $^{56}$Ni to stable isotopes
such as $^{54}$Fe and $^{58}$Ni in the $\alpha$-rich freeze-out regime. The
isotopes of the metallicity implementation further serve as seed nuclei for
additional reactions in the shell detonation. Most significantly, the
production of $^{55}$Mn increases with metallicity confirming the results of
previous work. A comparison of elemental ratios relative to iron shows a
relatively good match to solar values for some models. Super-solar values are
reached for Mn at 3$Z_\odot$ and solar values in some models at $Z_\odot$. This
indicates that the required contribution of SNe Ia originating from
Chandrasekhar mass WDs can be lower than estimated in orevious work to reach
solar values of [Mn/Fe] at [Fe/H]$=0$. Our galactic chemical evolution models
suggest that SNe Ia from sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, along with
core-collapse supernovae, could account for more than 80% of the solar Mn
abundance. Using metallicity-dependent SN Ia yields helps to reproduce the
upward trend of [Mn/Fe] as a function of metallicity for the solar
neighborhood. These chemical evolution predictions, however, depend on the
massive star yields adopted in the calculations.

usage and can also result in a high probability of jamming. Different from
existing works, in this paper, a novel anti-jamming strategy is proposed based
on the idea of deceiving the jammer into attacking a victim channel while
maintaining the communications of legitimate users in safe channels. Since the
jammer's channel information is not known to the users, an optimal channel
selection scheme and a sub optimal power allocation are proposed using
reinforcement learning (RL). The performance of the proposed anti-jamming
technique is evaluated by deriving the statistical lower bound of the total
received power (TRP). Analytical results show that, for a given access point,
over 50 % of the highest achievable TRP, i.e. in the absence of jammers, is
achieved for the case of a single user and three frequency channels. Moreover,
this value increases with the number of users and available channels. The
obtained results are compared with two existing RL based anti-jamming
techniques, and random channel allocation strategy without any jamming attacks.
Simulation results show that the proposed anti-jamming method outperforms the
compared RL based anti-jamming methods and random search method, and yields
near optimal achievable TRP.

new tasks effectively rather than master a single task. Meta-learning is
appealing for process control applications because the perturbations to a

Additionally, the dynamics and control objectives are similar across many
different processes, so it is feasible to create a generalizable controller
through meta-learning capable of quickly adapting to different systems. In this
work, we construct a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based controller and
meta-train the controller using a latent context variable through a separate
embedding neural network. We test our meta-algorithm on its ability to adapt to

to obtain a flux-calibrated spectrum that is compared with non-LTE spectral
energy distributions (SED) and line profiles for the proposed models. The
Hubble data, together with the Gaia EDR3 parallax, provide tight constraints on
the properties and stellar luminosities of the system. In the case of the
Be+Bstr model we adopt the published flux ratio for the Be and Bstr stars,
re-determine the T$_{eff}$ of the Bstr using the silicon ionization balance,
and infer Teff for the Be star from the fit to the SED. We derive stellar
parameters consistent with previous results, but with greater precision enabled
by the Hubble SED. While the Be+Bstr model is a better fit to the HeI lines and
cores of the Balmer lines in the optical, the B+BH model provides a better fit
to the Si iv resonance lines in the UV. The analysis also implies that the Bstr
star has roughly twice solar silicon abundance, difficult to reconcile with a
stripped star origin. The Be star on the other hand has a rather low
luminosity, and a spectroscopic mass inconsistent with its possible dynamical
mass. The fit to the UV can be significantly improved by reducing the T$_{eff}$
and radius of the Be star, though at the expense of leading to a different mass
ratio. In the B+BH model, the single B-type spectrum is a good match to the UV
spectrum. Adopting a mass ratio of 5.1$\pm$0.1 (Liu et al. 2020) implies a BH
mass of $\sim$21$^{+9}_{-8}M_{\odot}$.

extensively. Sorting plays an important role in the area of databases, as many
queries can be served much faster if the relations are first sorted. One of the
most popular sorting algorithm in databases is merge sort.
  In modern data-centers, data is stored in storage servers, while processing
takes place in compute servers. Hence, in order to compute queries on the data,
it must travel through the network from the storage servers to the compute
servers. This creates a potential for utilizing programmable switches to
perform partial sorting in order to accelerate the sorting process at the
server side. This is possible because, as mentioned above, data packets pass
through the switch in any case on their way to the server. Alas, programmable
switches offer a very restricted and non-intuitive programming model, which is
why realizing this is not-trivial.
  We devised a novel partial sorting algorithm that fits the programming model
and restrictions of programmable switches and can expedite merge sort at the
server. We also utilize built-in parallelism in the switch to divide the data
into sequential ranges. Thus, the server needs to sort each range separately
and then concatenate them to one sorted stream. This way, the server needs to
sort smaller sections and each of these sections is already partially sorted.
Hence, the server does less work, and the access pattern becomes more
virtual-memory friendly.
  We evaluated the performance improvements obtained when utilizing our partial
sorting algorithm over several data stream compositions with various switch
configurations. Our study exhibits an improvement of 20%-75% in the sorting
run-time when using our approach compared to plain sorting on the original
stream.

Networks} (HFKNs). The focus of this paper is the specification and prototyping
of a general distributed system architecture that supports the creation of
HFKNs by teams of robots and humans. The information collected ranges from
low-level sensor data to high-level semantic knowledge, the latter represented
in part as RDF Graphs. The framework includes a synchronization protocol and
associated algorithms that allow for the automatic distribution and sharing of
data and knowledge between agents. This is done through the distributed
synchronization of RDF Graphs shared between agents. High-level semantic
queries specified in SPARQL can be used by robots and humans alike to acquire
both knowledge and data content from team members. The system is empirically
validated and complexity results of the proposed algorithms are provided.
Additionally, a field robotics case study is described, where a 3D mapping
mission has been executed using several UAVs in a collaborative emergency
rescue scenario while using the full HFKN Framework.

acquire human-interpretable generative factors, like what an ICA (from the
linear domain) does, we propose Full Encoder, a novel unified autoencoder
framework as a correspondence to PCA in the non-linear domain. The idea is to
train an autoencoder with one latent variable first, then involve more latent
variables progressively to refine the reconstruction results. The Full Encoder
is also a latent variable predictive model that the latent variables acquired
are stable and robust, as they always learn the same representation regardless
of the network initial states. Full Encoder can be used to determine the
degrees of freedom in a simple non-linear system and can be useful for data
compression or anomaly detection. Full Encoder can also be combined with the
beta-VAE framework to sort out the importance of the generative factors,
providing more insights for non-linear system analysis. These qualities will
make FE useful for analyzing real-life industrial non-linear systems. To
validate, we created a toy dataset with a custom-made non-linear system to test
it and compare its properties to those of VAE and beta-VAE's.

the superconductor was not yet reported. The peculiar vacuum of the BCS
condensate opens the way to annihilate or generate two electrons from the bulk

quantum cosmology (LQC) is to provide an accurate depiction of the real world,
it must allow for quantum states of spacetime geometry which are semi-classical
in two respects: they must be sharply peaked around a single, classical
geometry, and they must have small quantum fluctuations. It is generally
assumed that Gaussian states exhibit both of these properties. After all, they
do in ordinary quantum mechanics. In this paper, we derive exact closed-form
expressions for the fluctuations of Gaussian states in LQC and their lower
bound given by the Robertson-Schr\""odinger inequality. We demonstrate that,
contrary to ordinary quantum mechanics, fluctuations for Gaussian states in
spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic LQC diverge as the state variance
increases (as well as in related cosmological models with the same kinematic
Hilbert space and canonical observables). However, when the holonomy length is
made to scale with a volume regularization parameter, these fluctuations may be
arbitrarily suppressed by taking the fiducial volume to be large, providing
analytic control over their divergence. Finally, we show that, despite this,
Gaussian states in LQC generally do not minimize uncertainty. Moreover, it is
conjectured that no such minimal-uncertainty states exist. Throughout this
work, it becomes clear how important the often-assumed condition of holonomy
length volume-scaling is; we show that when this condition is violated, the
resulting theory exhibits operator closure pathologies and other exotic
algebraic features.

twist-angle-dependent electronic structure leads to a host of unique
properties, such as superconductivity, correlated insulating states, and
magnetism. The flat bands that emerge at low twist angles in TBG result in
sharp features in the electronic density of states (DOS), affecting transport.
Here we show that they lead to superior and tuneable thermoelectric (TE)
performance. Combining an iterative Boltzmann transport equation solver and
electronic structure from an exact continuum model, we calculate thermoelectric
transport properties of TBG at different twist angles, carrier densities, and
temperatures. Our simulations show the room-temperature TE power factor (PF) in
TBG reaches 40 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$, significantly higher than single-layer
graphene (SLG) and among the highest reported to date. The peak PF is observed
near the magic angle, at a twist angle of $\approx$1.3$^\circ$, and near
complete band filling. We elucidate that its dependence is driven by the band
gap between lowest and second subband, which improves Seebeck but decreases
with twist angle, and Fermi velocity, which dictates conductivity and rises
with twist angle. We observed a further increase in the PF of TBG with
decreasing temperature. The strong TE performance, along with the ability to
fine-tune transport using twist angle, makes TBG an interesting candidate for
future research and applications in energy conversion and thermal sensing and
management.

adequate benchmark for UDA (https://qliu24.github.io/udapart). In UDA-Part, we
label parts on 3D CAD models which enables us to generate a large set of
annotated synthetic images. We also annotate parts on a number of real images
to provide a real test set. Secondly, to advance the adaptation of part models
trained from the synthetic data to the real images, we introduce a new UDA
algorithm that leverages the object's spatial structure to guide the adaptation
process. Our experimental results on two real test datasets confirm the
superiority of our approach over existing works, and demonstrate the promise of
learning part segmentation for general objects from synthetic data. We believe
our dataset provides a rich testbed to study UDA for part segmentation and will

well as their promise to improve solutions to data-driven decision problems,
has resulted in popularity of using ML techniques in software systems. However,
end-to-end development of ML-enabled systems, as well as their seamless
deployment and operations, remain a challenge. One reason is that development
and deployment of ML-enabled systems involves three distinct workflows,
perspectives, and roles, which include data science, software engineering, and
operations. These three distinct perspectives, when misaligned due to incorrect
assumptions, cause ML mismatches which can result in failed systems. We
conducted an interview and survey study where we collected and validated common
types of mismatches that occur in end-to-end development of ML-enabled systems.
Our analysis shows that how each role prioritizes the importance of relevant
mismatches varies, potentially contributing to these mismatched assumptions. In
addition, the mismatch categories we identified can be specified as machine
readable descriptors contributing to improved ML-enabled system development. In
this paper, we report our findings and their implications for improving

and paramilitary groups called \textit{mil\'icias} control some regions of the
city where the government is not present, specially in the slums. Due to the
characteristics of such two distinct groups, it was observed that the evolution
of COVID-19 is different in those two regions, in comparison with the regions
controlled by the government. In order to understand qualitatively those
observations, we divided the city in three regions controlled by the
government, by the drug gangs and by the \textit{mil\'icias}, respectively, and
we consider a SIRD-like epidemic model where the three regions are coupled.
Considering different levels of exposure, the model is capable to reproduce
qualitatively the distinct evolution of the COVID-19 disease in the three

exploiting the property of Discriminative Semantic Transitive Consistency --
ensuring that the data points are correctly classified even after being

we also enforce the traditional distance minimizing constraint which makes the
projections of the corresponding data points from both the modalities to come

central to quantum information. In the last two decades, two different
approaches with independent starting points and motivations have come together
for this purpose. One was to develop the unitary time evolution of two or more
qubits for studying quantum correlations, exploiting the relevant Lie algebras
and especially sub-algebras of the Hamiltonians involved, and arriving at
connections to finite projective geometries and combinatorial designs.
Independently, geometers studying projective ring lines and associated finite

the Lie algebraic and group representation perspective of quantum physics and
the geometric algebraic one, along with connections to complex quaternions.
Together, all this may be seen as further development of Felix Klein's Erlangen

the continuous SU(4) Lie group for two-qubits can be placed in one-to-one
correspondence with finite projective geometries, combinatorial Steiner
designs, and finite quaternionic groups. The very different perspectives may
provide further insight into problems in quantum information. Extensions are
considered for multiple qubits and higher spin or higher dimensional qudits.

However, for over-parameterized models -- where the number of fit parameters is
large enough to perfectly fit the training data -- this picture becomes
uninformative. Here, we present an alternative geometric interpretation of
regression that applies to both under- and over-parameterized models. Unlike
the classical picture which takes place in the space of training labels, our
new picture resides in the space of input features. This new feature-based
perspective provides a natural geometric interpretation of the double-descent
phenomenon in the context of bias and variance, explaining why it can occur
even in the absence of label noise. Furthermore, we show that adversarial
perturbations -- small perturbations to the input features that result in large
changes in label values -- are a generic feature of biased models, arising from
the underlying geometry. We demonstrate these ideas by analyzing three minimal
models for over-parameterized linear least squares regression: without basis
functions (input features equal model features) and with linear or nonlinear
basis functions (two-layer neural networks with linear or nonlinear activation
functions, respectively).

detect the transverse BAO signal ${\theta}_{BAO} = 19.8^{\deg} {\pm}

angular BAO signature. Supported by a large set of log-normal simulations, our
error analyses include statistical and systematic contributions. In addition,
considering the sound horizon scale calculated by the Planck Collaboration,

measurement of the angular diameter distance $D_{A}(0.11) = 258.31 {\pm} 13.71

with other BAO angular scale data reported in the literature, we perform
statistical analyses for the cosmological parameters of some Lambda cold dark
matter (${\Lambda}$CDM) type models.

pipeline STEREO based on active wrapper induction and unsupervised aspect
extraction. We applied our pipeline to the over 100,000 documents in the
CORD-19 dataset. It required only 0.25% of the corpus (about 500 documents) to
learn statistics extraction rules that cover 95% of the sentences in CORD-19.
The statistic extraction has nearly 100% precision on APA-conform and 95%
precision on non-APA writing styles. In total, we were able to extract 113k
reported statistics, of which only <1% is APA conform. We could extract in 46%
the correct conditions from APA-conform reports (30% for non-APA). The best
model for topic extraction achieves a precision of 75% on statistics reported
in APA style (73% for non-APA conform). We conclude that STEREO is a good
foundation for automatic statistic extraction and future developments for

However, observing V requires detailed and expensive labels. We propose graph

domain where only normal labels W are available. Focusing on the problem of
predicting chemical compound graphs from 2D images the fully mediating layer is
represented using the planar embedding of the chemical graph structure we are

mechanism of the underlying process. However if the assumptions are correct it
should allow the machine learning model to be more interpretable, generalize
better and be more data efficient at training time. The empirical results show
that, using only 4000 data points, we obtain up to 4x improvement of
performance after domain adaptation to target domain compared to pretrained

evaporating and condensing lithium surfaces. By evaporating lithium near or at
the divertor plate and condensing it closer to the main chamber, a lithium
vapor density gradient can be created. This density gradient ties energy losses
to poloidal distance between the target and the detachment point. The radiation
zone is then prevented from reaching the X-point as the lithium ionization rate
decreases when the detachment front moves away from the divertor target. Here
we present Scrape Off Layer Plasma Simulator (SOLPS) simulations of a lithium
vapor box divertor using an NSTX-U equilibrium and PFC geometry. The parameters
for the core boundary conditions, gas puff intensity, and heat and particle
transport coefficients are chosen to match experimental values. Acceptable
agreement with experimental Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) widths is found, indicating
a reasonable choice of transport coefficients. In predictive simulations,
lithium is added via evaporation at the target. Predictions for peak heat
fluxes and upstream impurity concentration are given for a variety of
evaporation rates. Target electron temperature is predicted to be able to be
reduced to recombination levels (below 1 eV) for lithium evaporation rates of
$1\cdot10^{23}$ Li/s, indicating detachment. Peak heat flux at the lower outer
target could be reduced by as much as a factor of six while maintaining
upstream lithium fractions below 2%. The prevention of lithium from reaching
the midplane is shown to be due to an increase in frictional forces acting on
the lithium from a deuterium gas puff. Lithium is also shown to be redeposited
close to the evaporator which is favorable for initial tests and future

simultaneously classify objects into known classes and to identify possible new
object types using a set of continuous attributes. This application is
motivated by the needs of identifying and possibly detecting new types of a
particular kind of stars known as variable stars. We first suitably transform
the physical attributes of the stars onto the simplex to achieve scale
invariance while maintaining their dependence structure. This allows us to
compare data collected by different sky surveys which can have different
scales. The model hence combines a mixture of Dirichlet mixtures to represent
the known classes with the semi-supervised classification strategy of Vatanen
et al. (2012) for outlier detection. In line with previous work on
semiparametric model-based clustering, the single Dirichlet distributions can
be seen as providing the baseline pattern of the data. These are then combined
to effectively model the complex distributions of the attributes for the
different classes. The model is estimated using a hierarchical two-step
procedure which combines a suitably adapted version of the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with Bayes' rule. We validate our model
on a reliable sample of periodic variable stars available in the literature

saturate the usable bandwidth, and new dimensions of data transfer will be

that if the number of vehicles is less than a certain critical threshold,
vehicles can occupy the limited space in many different configurations, i.e.,
different platoons of different sizes, and they converge to a uniform maximum
speed while attenuating errors in the relative spacing upstream a platoon. If
the number of vehicles exceeds the threshold, vehicles converge to a unique
symmetric configuration and the equilibrium speed decreases as the number of

have experienced explosive growth in transaction volume, leading to frequent
surges in demand for limited block space and causing transaction fees to
fluctuate by orders of magnitude. Existing systems sell space using first-price
auctions; however, users find it difficult to estimate how much they need to
bid in order to get their transactions accepted onto the chain. If they bid too
low, their transactions can have long confirmation times. If they bid too high,
they pay larger fees than necessary.
  In light of these issues, new transaction fee mechanisms have been proposed,
most notably EIP-1559, aiming to provide better usability. EIP-1559 is a
history-dependent mechanism that relies on block utilization to adjust a base
fee. We propose an alternative design -- a {\em dynamic posted-price mechanism}
-- which uses not only block utilization but also observable bids from past
blocks to compute a posted price for subsequent blocks. We show its potential
to reduce price volatility by providing examples for which the prices of
EIP-1559 are unstable while the prices of the proposed mechanism are stable.
More generally, whenever the demand for the blockchain stabilizes, we ask if
our mechanism is able to converge to a stable state. Our main result provides
sufficient conditions in a probabilistic setting for which the proposed
mechanism is approximately welfare optimal and the prices are stable. Our main
technical contribution towards establishing stability is an iterative algorithm
that, given oracle access to a Lipschitz continuous and strictly concave
function $f$, converges to a fixed point of $f$.

convolution, a novel framework that breaks down the 6D convolution into two
separable convolutional operators alternatively performed in the 3D Euclidean

compromising the performance. Second, we introduce an attention layer to
effectively harness the expressiveness of the equivariant features. While
jointly trained with the network, the attention layer implicitly derives the
intrinsic local frame in the feature space and generates attention vectors that
can be integrated into different alignment tasks. We evaluate our approach

the stiffness of these regions and the contact geometry, which affects the
stress distribution within the bulk region. We demonstrate that, contrary to

elastic deformation of the surrounding bulk is significant and, in some case,
may be dominant. We also show that the activation volume and the

abundances. A comprehensive list of CVs which includes those that have been
examined for these abundances is given. Three possible sources of these
non-solar abundances on the secondary are accretion during the red giant common
envelope phase, an Evolved Main Sequence secondary and nova-processed material.
Use of the secondary's cross-section just on the escaping nova material to
change the abundances of its convective region has been the killing objection
for considering nova-processed material. The key element, ignored in other
studies, is that a thermonuclear runaway on a white dwarf causes a strong
propagating shock wave which not only ejects material, but also produces a
large amount of non-ejected material which forms a common envelope. This
nova-produced common envelope contains a large amount of non-solar material. We
demonstrate that the secondary has the capacity and time to re-accrete enough
of this material to acquire a significant non-solar convective region. This
same envelope interacting with the binary will produce a Frictional Angular
Momentum Loss which can be the Consequential Angular Momentum Loss needed for
the average CV white dwarf mass, WD mass accretion rates, the period minimum,
the orbital period distribution, and the space density of CVs problems. This
interaction will decrease the orbital period which can cause the recently
observed sudden period decreases across nova eruptions. A simple, rapid
evolutionary model of the secondary that includes the swept-up nova-produced
material and the increasing convective region is developed and applied to
individual CVs.

is used in practice to accelerate Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that
sample the Gibbs distribution by adding nonreversible transitions or
non-gradient drift terms. The breaking of detailed balance also accelerates the
convergence of empirical estimators to their ergodic expectation in the
long-time limit. Here, we give a physical interpretation of this second form of
acceleration in terms of currents associated with the fluctuations of empirical
estimators using the level 2.5 of large deviations, which characterises the
likelihood of density and current fluctuations in Markov processes. Focusing on
diffusion processes, we show that there is accelerated convergence because
estimator fluctuations arise in general with current fluctuations, leading to
an added large deviation cost compared to the reversible case, which shows no
current. We study the current fluctuation most likely to arise in conjunction
with a given estimator fluctuation and provide bounds on the acceleration,

systematic bias in estimation, so specific corrections are needed. A relevant
target in Survival Analysis is the hazard rate function, which represents the
instantaneous probability for the event of interest. In this work we introduce
a flexible estimation approach for the hazard rate under double truncation.
Specifically, a kernel smoother is considered, in both a fully nonparametric
setting and a semiparametric setting in which the incidence process fits a
given parametric model. Properties of the kernel smoothers are investigated
both theoretically and through simulations. In particular, an asymptotic
expression of the mean integrated squared error is derived, leading to a
data-driven bandwidth for the estimators. The relevance of the semiparametric
approach is emphasized, in that it is generally more accurate and, importantly,
it avoids the potential issues of nonexistence or nonuniqueness of the fully
nonparametric estimator. Applications to the age of diagnosis of Acute Coronary

legislations with the real-world practices adapted by CSPs. We found that three
of the regulations (GDPR, COPPA, and CCPA) analyzed defined mobile location
data as private information, and two (T-Mobile US, Boost Mobile) of the five
CSPs that were analyzed did not comply with the COPPA regulation. Our results
are crucial in view of the threat these violations represent, especially when
it comes to children's data. As such proper security and privacy auditing is
necessary to curtail such violations. We conclude by providing actionable
recommendations to address concerns and provide privacy-preserving monitoring
of the COVID-19 spread through the contact tracing applications.

multi-agent systems where the agents' dynamics are modeled by Gaussian
Processes (GPs). Two fundamental problems are considered: the optimal design of
experiment for concurrent learning of the agents' GP models, and the
distributed coordination given the learned models. Using a Distributed Model
Predictive Control (DMPC) approach, the two problems are formulated as
distributed optimization problems, where each agent's sub-problem includes both
local and shared objectives and constraints. To solve the resulting complex and
non-convex DMPC problems efficiently, we develop an algorithm called
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers with Convexification (ADMM-C) that
combines a distributed ADMM algorithm and a Sequential Convexification method.
The computational efficiency of our proposed method comes from the facts that
the computation for solving the DMPC problem is distributed to all agents and
that efficient convex optimization solvers are used at the agents for solving
the convexified sub-problems. We also prove that, under some technical
assumptions, the ADMM-C algorithm converges to a stationary point of the
penalized optimization problem. The effectiveness of our approach is
demonstrated in numerical simulations of a multi-vehicle formation control
example.

a byproduct, we generalize to this setting several classical results for

$\text{Ext}^1$-universal object $V$ such that $\text{Ext}_{\mathcal{A}}^1(V,-)$
vanishes on all (existing) coproducts of copies of $V$. For many choices of

$T\in\mathcal{T}$ is the epimorphic image of some object in

complete cotorsion pairs in $\mathcal{A}$ (resp., $\mathcal{B}$).
  In a final section, we apply the results when

these tasks, only image-level labels, which are much cheaper to acquire, are

distribution of the novel objects and localizes them via
expectation-maximization steps. As a probabilistic model, we employ von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution which captures the semantic information better
than Gaussian distribution when applied to the pre-trained embedding space.
When the novel objects are localized, we utilize them to learn a linear
appearance model to detect novel classes in new images. Our extensive
experiments show that the proposed method, despite being simple, outperforms
strong baselines in few-shot COL and WSOD, as well as large-scale WSOD tasks.

which manifests either due to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data or adversarial

often trained and used in parallel to the controller DNN, increasing the
resource burden and latency. We hypothesize that a single network that can
perform controller predictions and anomaly detection is necessary to reduce the
resource requirements. Deep-Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks provide a
rejection class alongside the class predictions, which can be utilized for
detecting anomalies at runtime. However, the use of RBF activation functions
limits the applicability of these networks to only classification tasks. In
this paper, we show how the deep-RBF network can be used for detecting
anomalies in CPS regression tasks such as continuous steering predictions.
Further, we design deep-RBF networks using popular DNNs such as NVIDIA DAVE-II,

adversarial attacks such as a physical attack and data poison attack. Finally,
we evaluate these attacks and the trained deep-RBF networks using a hardware

finding evidence for the putative binary SMBHs (such as dual radio cores), and
testing the competing physical models. We detect exactly half of the target
sample from our VLBA imaging, after implementing a 5 detection limit. While we
do not resolve double radio sources in any of the targets, we obtain limits on
the instantaneous projected separations of a radio-emitting binary for all of
the detected sources under the assumption that a binary still exists within our
VLBA angular resolution limits. We also assess the likelihood that a
radio-emitting companion SMBH exists outside of our angular resolution limits,
but its radio luminosity is too weak to produce a detectable signal in the VLBA
data. Additionally, we compare the precise sky positions afforded by these data

abstractions to developers. However, due to the abstraction, there may be many
challenges for developers to understand and debug the data processing code. To
uncover the challenges in using big data frameworks, we first conduct an
empirical study on 1,000 Apache Spark-related questions on Stack Overflow. We
find that most of the challenges are related to data transformation and API
usage. To solve these challenges, we design an approach, which assists
developers with understanding and debugging data processing in Spark. Our
approach leverages statistical sampling to minimize performance overhead, and
provides intermediate information and hint messages for each data processing
step of a chained method pipeline. The preliminary evaluation of our approach
shows that it has low performance overhead and we receive good feedback from

standards often assume arbitrary values and are thought to evolve neutrally.
But neutral evolution cannot explain why some traits come and go in cycles of
popularity while others become entrenched. Here we study frequency-dependent
selection (FDS)--where a trait's tendency to be copied depends on its current
frequency regardless of the trait value itself. We develop a maximum-likelihood
method to infer the precise form of FDS from time series of trait abundance,
and we apply the method to data on baby names and pet dog breeds over the last
century. We find that the most common names tend to decline by 2%-6% per yr on
average; whereas rare names--1 in 10,000 births--tend to increase by 1%-3% per
yr. This specific form of negative FDS explains patterns of diversity and
replicates across the United States, France, Norway and the Netherlands,
despite cultural, linguistic and demographic variation. We infer a fixed
fitness offset between male and female names that implies different rates of
innovation. We also find a strong selective advantage for biblical names in
every frequency class, which explains their predominance among the most common
names. In purebred dog registrations we infer a form of negative FDS that is
consistent with a preference for novelty, in which each year's newest breeds
outgrow the previous by about 1%/yr, which also recapitulates boom-bust cycles
in dog fanciers. Finally, we define the concept of effective
frequency-dependent selection, which enables a meaningful interpretation of
inferred FDS even for complex mechanisms of evolution. Our analysis generalizes
neutral evolution to incorporate pressures of conformity and anti-conformity as
fundamental forces in social evolution, and our inference procedure provides a
quantitative account of how these forces operate within and across cultures.

measure to recover the voltage stability of the electric power grid under

amount of load which can be unnecessary and harmful to customers. Recently,
deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been regarded and adopted as a promising
approach that can significantly reduce the amount of load shedding. However,
like most existing machine learning (ML)-based control techniques, RL control
usually cannot guarantee the safety of the systems under control. In this
paper, we introduce a novel safe RL method for emergency load shedding of power
systems, that can enhance the safe voltage recovery of the electric power grid
after experiencing faults. Unlike the standard RL method, the safe RL method
has a reward function consisting of a Barrier function that goes to minus
infinity when the system state goes to the safety bounds. Consequently, the
optimal control policy, that maximizes the reward function, can render the
power system to avoid the safety bounds. This method is general and can be
applied to other safety-critical control problems. Numerical simulations on the
39-bus IEEE benchmark is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed safe RL emergency control, as well as its adaptive capability to
faults not seen in the training.

(EHQCD), proposed in Ref.[1], is investigated in the present work. EHQCD models
are characterized by two parameters, the conformal dimension of the relevant
operator that deforms the CFT and the associated coupling. We find that black
hole solutions appear at temperatures higher than some temperature $T_{min}$
and can be categorized in two classes: large and small black holes. A large
black hole is thermally stable and it is therefore interpreted as the gravity
dual of a non-conformal plasma. A small black hole, on the other hand, is
thermally unstable. We show that thermodynamic quantities such as the entropy
density $s$, specific heat $C_V$, and speed of sound $c_s$ are sensitive to the
model parameters. We investigate perturbations of the black hole solutions and
calculate the viscosity coefficients of the corresponding dual non-conformal
plasma. For the shear viscosity, we confirm that the ratio $\eta/s$ is given by
the universal result $1/4\pi$. For the bulk viscosity, the ratio $\zeta/s$
varies with the temperature, displaying a rapid growth close to $T_{min}$, and
it is sensitive to the model parameters. We compare our results for the
thermodynamic quantities with the lattice $SU(N_C)$ results and find that they
are compatible as long as the coupling is fixed appropriately as a function of

in several sites. This phenomenon is often referred to as ""quarantine fatigue"".
Mathematical models have been used for more than a century to study the
dynamics of diseases spread. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large
number of models have been developed to investigate different aspects of the
pandemic. The aim of the present work has been to design and explore a
mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 spread with quarantine fatigue. A
deterministic model represented by a system of differential equations, based on
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) dynamics, was developed. The model was
explored by means of computational simulations. The results obtained show that,
in some scenarios, after a first prevalence peak, fatigue can cause a second
peak. Thus, the dynamic behavior of the model suggests that fatigue may have
contributed to the production of the second peak of infected people observed in
different parts of the world between 2020 and early 2021. The explorations
performed also showed that the model is sensitive to infection rate and other
parameters related to propagation dynamics. The developed model is relatively
simple and has important limitations for performing accurate predictions in the
real world. However, our study highlights the importance of considering
quarantine fatigue in the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well
as of possible future pandemics caused by other pathogens.

Fast Parameters Tuning in Weighted Nearest Neighbors. The first approach uses
classical parameters tuning that compares the most recent subsequence with
every possible subsequence from the past of the same length. The second
approach reduces the neighbors' search set, which leads to significantly
reduced grid size and hence a lower computational time. To tune the models'
parameters, both methods implement an approach inspired by cross-validation for
weighted nearest neighbors. We evaluate the forecasting performance and

phonon transport in polycrystalline Si0.8Ge0.2 containing prismatic pores
perpendicular to the transport current. The models are free of tuning

a combination of pores and grain boundaries suppresses phonon conductivity to a
magnitude comparable with the electronic thermal conductivity. In this regime,
ZT can be further enhanced by reducing carrier concentration to the electrical

Although increases in ZT are modest, the optimal carrier concentration is
significantly lowered, meaning semiconductors need not be so strongly

uncertainty. Moreover, the total cost could be dramatically lowered through
active fidelity switching, while remaining robust to changes in data
distribution. We propose a multi-fidelity approach that makes cost-sensitive

The PSR model considers the viscous heating and compressibility effects on the

variable and incorporating absolute enthalpy as the control variable for the
look-up table. It is firstly validated by using a priori analysis of the
viscous heating and compressibility effects. Then an auto-igniting hydrogen
flame stabilized in supersonic vitiated co-flowing jet is simulated with
LES-PSR method. The results show that the shock wave structure, overall flame
characteristics, flame-shock interaction and lift-off height are accurately
captured. Good agreements of the velocity and mixture fraction statistics with
the experimental data are observed. The results also show that the LES-PSR
model can predict the mean temperature and mole fractions of major species
quite well in both flame induction and stabilization zones. However, there are
some under-predictions of temperature RMS by about 100-150 K, which may be due
to the chemical non-equilibrium in the H2/O2-enriched combustion product of the
co-flowing jet. The scatter plots of two probe locations respectively from
induction and flame zones show that the respective flame structures in mixture
fraction space are captured well. However, the flucturations of the temperature
and species mole fractions are under-predicted in the flame zone. The
shock-induced auto-igniting spots are captured by the PSR model. These spots
are highly unsteady and play an important role in flame stabilization. It is
also shown that the intense reactions are initiated at mixture fractions around
the stoichiometry or fuel-lean values, corresponding to local elevated pressure
(1.5-2.0 atm) due to shock compression.

to describe the evolutions of flame propagation speed, flame temperature,
droplet evaporation onset and completion locations in ignition and propagation
of spherical flames. The influences of liquid droplet mass loading, heat
exchange coefficient (or evaporation rate) and Lewis number on spherical spray
flame ignition are studied. Two flame regimes are considered, i.e.,
heterogeneous and homogeneous flames, based on the mixture condition near the
flame front. The results indicate that the spray flame trajectories are
considerably affected by the ignition energy addition. The critical condition
for successful ignition for the fuel-rich mixture is coincidence of inner and
outer flame balls from igniting kernel and propagating flame. The flame balls
always exist in homogeneous mixtures, indicating that ignition failure and
critical successful events occur only in purely gaseous mixture. The fuel
droplets have limited effects on minimum ignition energy, which however
increases monotonically with the Lewis number. Moreover, flame kernel
originates from heterogeneous mixtures due to the initially dispersed droplets
near the spark. The evaporative heat loss in the burned and unburned zones of
homogeneous and heterogeneous spray flames is also evaluated, and the results
show that for the failed flame kernels, evaporative heat loss behind and before
the flame front first increases and then decreases. The evaporative heat loss
before the flame front generally increases, although non-monotonicity exists,
when the flame is successfully ignited and propagate outwardly. For
heterogeneous flames, the ratio of the heat loss from the burned zone to the
total one decreases as the flame expands.

Earth, isoprene is rapidly destroyed by oxygen-containing radicals, but its
production is ubiquitous to a diverse array of evolutionarily distant
organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals-few, if any at all, volatile

sinks of isoprene may exist, the destruction of isoprene in an anoxic

isoprene might accumulate in anoxic environments, we model the photochemistry

exoplanet anoxic atmospheres with a variety of atmosphere compositions under
different host star UV fluxes. Limited by an assumed 10 ppm instrument noise
floor, habitable atmosphere characterization using JWST is only achievable with

accuracy, modern approaches have neither a treatment of human-like reasoning on

the PrAE learner uses the representation to abduce the hidden rules. An answer

entire system is trained end-to-end in an analysis-by-synthesis manner without

exploiting advantages of three different doctrines of thought, which yields the

via latent factors subsumes the concept of social force commonly used in
physics-based approaches and implicitly encodes the distance as a cost, similar
to the way a planning-based method models the environment. (ii) By decomposing
the learning phases into two stages, a ""student"" can learn contextual cues from

communication between nodes relative to the amount of computation performed
locally in order to balance convergence accuracy and total application cost. In
this work, we generalize the convergence properties of a variant of NEAR-DGD

convergence to minimizers of a custom Lyapunov function. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the gap between those minimizers and the second order

sociologists, GT is often challenging for a majority of SE researchers to
understand and apply. Additionally, SE researchers attempting ad hoc
adaptations of traditional GT guidelines for modern socio-technical (ST)
contexts often struggle in the absence of clear and relevant guidelines to do
so, resulting in poor quality studies. To overcome these research community
challenges and leverage modern research opportunities, this paper presents
Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) designed to ease application and achieve
quality outcomes. It defines what exactly is meant by an ST research context
and presents the STGT guidelines that expand GT's philosophical foundations,
provide increased clarity and flexibility in its methodological steps and

frequent reporting of a variety of interim, preliminary, and mature outcomes,
and introduce nuanced evaluation guidelines for different outcomes. It is hoped
that the SE research community and related ST disciplines such as computer
science, data science, artificial intelligence, information systems, human

increasingly other disciplines being transformed by rapid digitalisation and

laws can be derived from the underpinning spacetime translation symmetry
according to the Noether procedure. However, the canonical Energy-Momentum
Tensors (EMTs) are neither symmetric nor gauge-symmetric (gauge invariant). The
Belinfante-Rosenfeld (BR) method is a well-known procedure to symmetrize the
EMTs, which also renders them gauge symmetric for first-order field theories.
High-order electromagnetic field theories appear in the study of gyrokinetic
systems for magnetized plasmas and the Podolsky system for the radiation
reaction of classical charged particles. For these high-order field theories,
gauge-symmetric EMTs are not necessarily symmetric and vice versa. In the
present study, we develop a new gauge-symmetrization method for EMTs in
high-order electromagnetic field theories. The Noether procedure is carried out
using the Faraday tensor F, instead of the 4-potential A, to derive a canonical
EMT T_N. We show that the gauge-dependent part of T_N can be removed using the
displacement-potential tensor \mathcal{F}=\mathcal{D}*A/4\pi, where \mathcal{D}
is the anti-symmetric electric displacement tensor. This method
gauge-symmetrize the EMT without necessarily making it symmetric, which is
adequate for applications not involving general relativity. For first-order
electromagnetic field theories, such as the standard Maxwell system,
\mathcal{F} reduces to the familiar BR super-potential \mathcal{S}, and the
method developed can be used as a simpler procedure to calculate \mathcal{S}
without employing the angular momentum tensor in 4D spacetime. When the
electromagnetic system is coupled to classical charged particles, the
gauge-symmetrization method for EMTs is shown to be effective as well.

small set of images with pixel-level annotations (strong supervisions) and a
large set of images with only image-level annotations (weak supervisions). Most
existing approaches aim to generate accurate pixel-level labels from weak
supervisions. However, we observe that those generated labels still inevitably
contain noisy labels. Motivated by this observation, we present a novel
perspective and formulate this task as a problem of learning with pixel-level
label noise. Existing noisy label methods, nevertheless, mainly aim at
image-level tasks, which can not capture the relationship between neighboring
labels in one image. Therefore, we propose a graph based label noise detection
and correction framework to deal with pixel-level noisy labels. In particular,
for the generated pixel-level noisy labels from weak supervisions by Class
Activation Map (CAM), we train a clean segmentation model with strong
supervisions to detect the clean labels from these noisy labels according to
the cross-entropy loss. Then, we adopt a superpixel-based graph to represent
the relations of spatial adjacency and semantic similarity between pixels in
one image. Finally we correct the noisy labels using a Graph Attention Network
(GAT) supervised by detected clean labels. We comprehensively conduct
experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context and MS-COCO datasets. The
experimental results show that our proposed semi supervised method achieves the
state-of-the-art performances and even outperforms the fully-supervised models

stages: the outer problem of minimizing the mismatch between network
observation and prediction over the network parameters, and the inner problem
of predicting the system state for given values of the parameters. The standard
solution of the combined problem is iterative: (a) set the parameters, e.g. to
priors on the power line characteristics, (b) map input observation to
prediction of the output, (c) compute the mismatch between predicted and
observed output, (d) make a gradient descent step in the space of parameters to
minimize the mismatch, and loop back to (a). We show how modern Machine
Learning (ML), and specifically training guided by automatic differentiation,
allows to resolve the iterative loop more efficiently. Moreover, we extend the
scheme to the case of incomplete observations, where Phasor Measurement Units

the generators (PV buses), while loads (PQ buses) report (via SCADA controls)
only active and reactive powers. Considering it from the implementation

significant changes to electricity systems around the world. Examples of DERs
include solar panels, small natural gas-fueled generators, combined heat and
power plants, etc. Due to the small supply capacities of these DERs, it is
impractical for them to participate directly in the wholesale electricity
market. We study in this paper an efficient aggregation model where a
profit-maximizing aggregator procures electricity from DERs, and sells them in
the wholesale market. The interaction between the aggregator and the DER owners
is modeled as a Stackelberg game: the aggregator adopts two-part pricing by
announcing a participation fee and a per-unit price of procurement for each DER
owner, and the DER owner responds by choosing her payoff-maximizing energy
supplies. We show that our proposed model preserves full market efficiency,
i.e., the social welfare achieved by the aggregation model is the same as that
when DERs participate directly in the wholesale market. We also note that
two-part pricing is critical for market efficiency, and illustrate via an
example that with one-part pricing, there will be an efficiency loss from DER
aggregation, due to the profit-seeking behavior of the aggregator.

between different labeled CT scans with semantically similar features. Here, we
use Adaptive Structural Instance Normalization (AdaSIN) to enhance de-biasing
generation quality and guarantee structural consistency. Following, a

communication overhead during model uploading. To fully exploit the advantages
of hierarchical FL, an accurate convergence analysis with respect to the key
system parameters is needed. Unfortunately, existing analysis is loose and does
not consider model quantization. In this paper, we derive a tighter convergence
bound for hierarchical FL with quantization. The convergence result leads to
practical guidelines for important design problems such as the client-edge
aggregation and edge-client association strategies. Based on the obtained
analytical results, we optimize the two aggregation intervals and show that the
client-edge aggregation interval should slowly decay while the edge-cloud
aggregation interval needs to adapt to the ratio of the client-edge and
edge-cloud propagation delay. Simulation results shall verify the design
guidelines and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation
strategy.

uncertainties of range hypotheses in the former stages. Specifically, in our
DDR-Net, we first build an initial depth map at the coarsest resolution of an

leverages the probability distribution information of the initial depth to
estimate the depth range hypotheses dynamically for the following stages.
Moreover, we develop a novel loss strategy, which utilizes learned dynamic
depth ranges to generate refined depth maps, to keep the ground truth value of
each pixel covered in the range hypotheses of the next stage. Extensive
experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance over
other state-of-the-art methods on the DTU benchmark and obtains comparable

for the linear convective instability of the plane incompressible mixing layer
within the inviscid framework. We find that, as the critical condition for the
onset of absolute instability is approached, the integrated pressure-transport
term becomes increasingly more prominent as compared to the integrated
production term and it dominates the energy budget completely at the critical
condition. This implies that, near the threshold of absolute instability, the
growth of disturbances is almost entirely due to the pressure transport
mechanism (rather than the production mechanism), which is a striking result.
The part of the pressure-transport term that represents the work done by the
fluctuating pressure forces is seen to be primarily responsible for the
observed shift in the energy balance. These results can help us better
understand the physical processes causing absolute instability in a mixing
layer. In particular, the redistribution of disturbance energy in streamwise
direction by fluctuating pressure, which is ""non-local"" in character for
incompressible flows, seems to play a key role in this respect.

data indicate that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is not located at the
apparent stellar nucleus of the galaxy, but at a projected distance of $1.75$
$\pm$ $0.22$ arcsec ($139 \pm 17$ pc). This is probably caused by the high
interstellar extinction in the surroundings of the AGN, which corresponds to
the true nucleus of the galaxy, as also proposed by previous studies. The
morphology and classification of the optical line-emitting regions indicate two
ionization cones, around an axis with a position angle of $PA_{cones}$ =
-50{\deg} $\pm$ 7{\deg}, with emission-line spectra characteristic of Seyfert
galaxies. The stellar and gas kinematics are consistent with a stellar and gas
rotating disc around the nucleus, with a velocity amplitude of 125 km s$^{-1}$.
Two probable outflows from the AGN were detected along the region of the two
ionization cones. The AGN position does not coincide with the brightest
line-emitting region at the centre of NGC 1448. That may be a consequence of
the high obscuration from the AGN towards the observer (the AGN is actually
Compton thick), mostly caused by a nearly edge-on torus. An additional
hypothesis is that the AGN reduced its luminosity, during the last 440 yr, to
nearly half of the value in the past. In this case, the brightest line-emitting
region corresponds to a ""light echo"" or a ""fossil"" of the AGN in the past.

two types of fine-grained atomic operations (feature filtering and neighbor

neighbor aggregation captures structural information and calculates neighbors'

multiple message-passing mechanisms and optimal message-passing depth. The

between the object and supporting item to get an estimated stable pose. We then
run a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to refine the predicted stable

from its initial pose to stable hanging pose. To this end, we train a neural
network based collision estimator that takes as input partial point clouds of
the object and supporting item. We generate a new and challenging, large-scale,

the key aspects of space weather research. One of the commonly used models is,
due to its simplicity and calculation speed, the analytical drag-based model
(DBM) for heliospheric propagation of CMEs. DBM relies on the observational
fact that slow CMEs accelerate whereas fast CMEs decelerate, and is based on
the concept of MHD drag, which acts to adjust the CME speed to the ambient
solar wind. Although physically DBM is applicable only to the CME magnetic
structure, it is often used as a proxy for the shock arrival. In recent years,
the DBM equation has been used in many studies to describe the propagation of
CMEs and shocks with different geometries and assumptions. Here we give an
overview of the five DBM versions currently available and their respective
tools, developed at Hvar Observatory and frequently used by researchers and
forecasters. These include: 1) basic 1D DBM, a 1D model describing the
propagation of a single point (i.e. the apex of the CME) or concentric arc
(where all points propagate identically); 2) advanced 2D self-similar cone DBM,

are forced to maximally exploit the discrimination of heterogeneous acoustic
information in each audio clip with target events, which results in a robust
paired representations that can well discriminate the target events and
background/domain variations separately. Moreover, to better learn the
transient characteristics of target events, a frame-wise classifier is designed
to perform the final classification. In addition, a two-stage training with the

  Estimation","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. Open sourced",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the great progress in 3D human pose estimation from videos, it is
still an open problem to take full advantage of a redundant 2D pose sequence to
learn representative representations for generating one 3D pose. To this end,
we propose an improved Transformer-based architecture, called Strided
Transformer, which simply and effectively lifts a long sequence of 2D joint
locations to a single 3D pose. Specifically, a Vanilla Transformer Encoder
(VTE) is adopted to model long-range dependencies of 2D pose sequences. To
reduce the redundancy of the sequence, fully-connected layers in the
feed-forward network of VTE are replaced with strided convolutions to
progressively shrink the sequence length and aggregate information from local
contexts. The modified VTE is termed as Strided Transformer Encoder (STE),
which is built upon the outputs of VTE. STE not only effectively aggregates
long-range information to a single-vector representation in a hierarchical
global and local fashion, but also significantly reduces the computation cost.
Furthermore, a full-to-single supervision scheme is designed at both full
sequence and single target frame scales applied to the outputs of VTE and STE,
respectively. This scheme imposes extra temporal smoothness constraints in
conjunction with the single target frame supervision and hence helps produce
smoother and more accurate 3D poses. The proposed Strided Transformer is
evaluated on two challenging benchmark datasets, Human3.6M and HumanEva-I, and
achieves state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters. Code and models are
available at \url{https://github.com/Vegetebird/StridedTransformer-Pose3D}.

ethaline, by using dielectric spectroscopy on a broad range of frequency
(MHz-Hz) and for temperatures ranging from 128 to 283 K. The fraction of water
in the DES was varied systematically to cover different regimes, starting from
pure DES and its water-in-DES mixtures to the diluted electrolyte solutions.
Depending on these parameters, different physical states were examined,
including low viscosity liquid, supercooled viscous liquid, amorphous solid and
freeze-concentrated solution. The ionic conductivity and the reorientational
relaxation both exhibited characteristic features of glassy dynamics that could
be quantified from the deviation from Arrhenius temperature dependence and
non-exponential decay of the relaxation function. A transition occurred between
the water-in-DES regime, (< 40 wt %),where the dipolar relaxation and ionic
conductivity remained inversely proportional to each other, and the
DES-in-water regime, (> 40 wt %), where a clear rotation-translation decoupling
was observed. This suggests that for low water content, on the timescale
covered by this study (~10-6 s to 1 s), the rotational and transport properties
of ethaline aqueous solutions obey classical hydrodynamic scaling despite these
systems being presumably spatially microheterogeneous. A fractional scaling is
observed in the DES-in-water regime, due to the formation of a maximally

process regression is proposed. The selection of the most relevant variables
for a problem at hand often results in an increased interpretability and in
many cases is an essential step in terms of model regularization. In detail,
the proposed method relies on so-called nearest neighbor Gaussian processes,
that can be considered as highly scalable approximations of classical Gaussian
processes. To perform a variable selection the mean and the covariance function
of the process are conditioned on a random set $\mathcal{A}$. This set holds
the indices of variables that contribute to the model. While the specification
of a priori beliefs regarding $\mathcal{A}$ allows to control the number of
selected variables, so-called reference priors are assigned to the remaining
model parameters. The application of the reference priors ensures that the
process covariance matrix is (numerically) robust. For the model inference a
Metropolis within Gibbs algorithm is proposed. Based on simulated data, an
approximation problem from computer experiments and two real-world datasets,
the performance of the new approach is evaluated.

directly from data are known to suffer a drastic drop in accuracy in new
environments. Although supervised approaches with ground truth disparity maps
often work well, collecting them in each deployment environment is cumbersome
and costly. For this reason, many unsupervised domain adaptation methods based
on image-to-image translation have been proposed, but these methods do not
preserve the geometric structure of a stereo image pair because the
image-to-image translation is applied to each view separately. To address this
problem, in this paper, we propose an attention mechanism that aggregates
features in the left and right views, called Stereoscopic Cross Attention
(SCA). Incorporating SCA to an image-to-image translation network makes it
possible to preserve the geometric structure of a stereo image pair in the
process of the image-to-image translation. We empirically demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised domain adaptation based on the
image-to-image translation with SCA.

non-spherical. We choose six observed exoplanetary systems where the semi-major

systems. In four systems the star engulfs the planet on the RGB, and in two
systems on the AGB, and the systems enter a common envelope evolution (CEE). In
two systems where the exoplanet masses are Mp~10MJ, where MJ is Jupiter mass,
the planet spins-up the envelope to about 10% of the break-up velocity. Such
envelopes are likely to have significant non-spherical mass loss geometry. In
the other four systems where Mp~MJ the planet spins-up the envelope to values
of ~1-2% of break-up velocity. Magnetic activity in the envelope that
influences dust formation might lead to a small departure from spherical mass
loss even in these cases. In the two cases of CEE on the AGB the planet
deposits energy to the envelope that amounts to >10% of the envelope binding

realistic human image generation with only a small number of appearance inputs.
Despite recent advances in single person motion transfer, prior methods often
require a large number of training images and take long training time. One
promising direction is to perform few-shot human motion transfer, which only
needs a few of source images for appearance transfer. However, it is
particularly challenging to obtain satisfactory transfer results. In this
paper, we address this issue by rendering a human texture map to a surface
geometry (represented as a UV map), which is personalized to the source person.
Our geometry generator combines the shape information from source images, and
the pose information from 2D keypoints to synthesize the personalized UV map. A
texture generator then generates the texture map conditioned on the texture of
source images to fill out invisible parts. Furthermore, we may fine-tune the
texture map on the manifold of the texture generator from a few source images
at the test time, which improves the quality of the texture map without
over-fitting or artifacts. Extensive experiments show the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our

Pd--Au nanoalloys have been proposed as materials for hydrogen sensing. For
sensing, it is important that absorption/desorption isotherms are reproducible
and stable over time. A few studies have pointed to the influence of short and
long range chemical order on these isotherms, but many aspects of the impact of
chemical order have remained unexplored. Here, we use alloy cluster expansions
to describe the thermodynamics of hydrogen in Pd--Au in a wide concentration
range. We investigate how different chemical orderings, corresponding to
annealing at different temperatures as well as different external pressures of
hydrogen, impact the behavior of the material with focus on its hydrogen
absorption/desorption isotherms. In particular, we find that a long-range
ordered L1$_2$ phase is expected to form if the \ce{H2} pressure is
sufficiently high. Furthermore, we construct the phase diagram at temperatures
from \unit[250]{K} to \unit[500]{K}, showing that if full equilibrium is
reached in the presence of hydrogen, phase separation can often be expected to
occur, in stark contrast to the phase diagram in para-equilibrium. Our results
explain the experimental observation that absorption/desorption isotherms in
Pd--Au are often stable over time, but also reveal pitfalls for when this may

Nevertheless, due to the data scarcity, the mean-based prototypes are usually
biased. In this paper, we attempt to diminish the prototype bias by regarding
it as a prototype optimization problem. To this end, we propose a novel
meta-learning based prototype optimization framework to rectify prototypes,
\emph{i.e.}, introducing a meta-optimizer to optimize prototypes. Although the
existing meta-optimizers can also be adapted to our framework, they all

estimation is also biased on sparse data. To address the issue, we regard the
gradient and its flow as meta-knowledge and then propose a novel Neural
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-based meta-optimizer to polish prototypes,

prototypes as initial prototypes, and then model the process of prototype
optimization as continuous-time dynamics specified by a Neural ODE. A gradient

continuous gradient flow for prototype dynamics. Finally, the optimal

backpropagation amounts to the sequential approach (single shooting) to optimal
control, where the states variables have been eliminated. It is well known that
single shooting may lead to ill conditioning, and for this reason the
simultaneous approach (multiple shooting) is typically preferred. Motivated by
this hypothesis, an augmented Lagrangian algorithm is developed that only
requires an approximate solution to the Lagrangian subproblems up to a
user-defined accuracy. By applying this framework to the training of neural
networks, it is shown that the inner Lagrangian subproblems are amenable to be
solved using Gauss-Newton iterations. To fully exploit the structure of neural

employing an approach based on forward dynamic programming. Finally, the

this paper, we refine this approach: First, we show that the delay operator is
input-feedforward passive and second, we compute its gain exactly. Based on
these findings, we derive improved stability conditions both in case of full

only a finite-length and potentially noisy state-input trajectory of the
unknown system. In two examples, we illustrate the reduced conservativeness of

magnetization by persistent currents to cancel out the magnetic field error.
The screens are aligned with the main field components, such that only the
undesired field components are compensated. The screens are passive,
self-regulating, and do not require any external source of energy. Measurements
in liquid nitrogen at 77 Kelvin show for dipole-field configurations a
significant reduction of the magnetic-field error up to a factor of four. The
residual error is explained via numerical simulations, accounting for the

agreement with experimental results. Simulations show that if screens are
increased in width and thickness, and operated at 4.5 Kelvin, field errors may
be eliminated almost entirely for the typical excitation cycles of accelerator

different problems (e.g., storage, transmission, and privacy issues). In this
work, we deal with the source data-free unsupervised domain adaptation problem,

The virtual domain acts as a bridge between the source and target domains. On
one hand, we generate virtual domain samples based on an approximated Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) in the feature space with the pre-trained source model,
such that the virtual domain maintains a similar distribution with the source
domain without accessing to the original source data. On the other hand, we
also design an effective distribution alignment method to reduce the
distribution divergence between the virtual domain and the target domain by
gradually improving the compactness of the target domain distribution through
model learning. In this way, we successfully achieve the goal of distribution
alignment between the source and target domains by training deep networks
without accessing to the source domain data. We conduct extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets for both 2D image-based and 3D point cloud-based
cross-domain object recognition tasks, where the proposed method referred to

a time interval comparable to the oscillation periods of the detected field

identified and numerically modelled using a radial-symmetric flow formulation
for a fracture that comprises a non-linear constitutive relation for the
contact mechanics governing reversible fracture surface interaction. These two
groups represent radial-symmetric and plane-axisymmetric flow regimes from a
conventional pressure-diffusion perspective. A comprehensive parameter study
into the sensitivity of the applied hydro-mechanical model to changes in
characteristic fracture parameters revealed an interrelation between fracture
length and normal fracture stiffness that yield a match between field
observations and numerical results. Fracture stiffness values increase with
corresponding fracture length. Decomposition of the acting normal stresses into
a stresses associated with the deformation state of the global fracture
geometry and the contact stresses indicates that geometrically induced stresses
contribute the more the lower the total effective normal stress and the shorter
the fracture. Separating the contributions of the local contact mechanics and
the overall fracture geometry to fracture normal stiffness indicates that the
latter, the geometrical stiffness, constitutes a lower bound for total
stiffness; its relevance increases with decreasing fracture length, too. Our
study demonstrates that non-linear hydro-mechanical coupling can lead to vastly
different hydraulic responses and thus provides an alternative to conventional
pressure-diffusion analysis that requires changes in flow regime to cover the
full range of observations.

allow for potential dependent censoring by a terminal event such as death.
Joint frailty models for recurrent events and death with an additional
dependence parameter have been studied for cases in which individuals are
observed from the start of the event processes. However, the samples are often
selected at a later time, which results in delayed entry. Thus, only
individuals who have not yet experienced the terminal event will be included in
the study. We propose a method for estimating the joint frailty model from such
left-truncated data. The frailty distribution among the selected survivors
differs from the frailty distribution in the underlying population if the
recurrence process and the terminal event are associated. The correctly
adjusted marginal likelihood can be expressed as a ratio of two integrals over
the frailty distribution, which may be approximated using Gaussian quadrature.
The baseline rates are specified as piecewise constant functions, and the
covariates are assumed to have multiplicative effects on the event rates. We
assess the performance of the estimation procedure in a simulation study, and
apply the method to estimate age-specific rates of recurrent urinary tract
infections and mortality in an older population.

a few) of the normal outbursts during the supercycle. In 2019 a mean period of
positive superhumps was found to be 0.05829 d during the superoutbursts. Late
superhumps with a mean period of 0.057915 d which lasted about ~20 d after the
end of superoutburst and were replaced by an orbital period of 0.057026 d or
its orbital-negative superhump beat period were detected. An absence of eclipse
in the orbital light curve and its moderate amplitude are consistent with the
orbital inclination of about 40 degr found from spectroscopy. The blue peaks of
the V-Ic and B-Rc of superhumps during the superoutburst coincided with minima
of the light curves, while B-Rc of the late superhumps coincided with a rising
branch of the light curves. We found that a low mass ratio q=0.08 could explain
most of the peculiarities of this dwarf nova. The mass-transfer rate should be
accordingly higher than what is expected from gravitational radiation only,
this assumes the object is in a post-nova state and underwent a nova eruption
relatively recently -- hundreds of years ago. This object would provide
probably the first observational evidence that a nova eruption can occur even
in CVs near the period minimum.

the heat of formation in the gas phase, its most fundamental thermochemical

them. It emerges that the connected triple excitations contribution is the
third most important one, about an order of magnitude less important than the

but 1-2 orders of magnitude more important than the remainder. For the 200
total atomization energies of small molecules in the W4-17 benchmark, we have
investigated the basis set convergence of the connected triple excitations
contribution (T). Achieving basis set convergence for the valence triple
excitations energy is much easier than for the valence singles and doubles
correlation energy. Using reference data obtained from spdfghi and spdfghik
basis sets, we show that extrapolation from quintuple-zeta and sextuple-zeta
yields values within about 0.004 kcal/mol RMS. Convergence to within about 0.01
kcal/mol is achievable with quadruple- and quintuple-zeta basis sets, and to
within about 0.05 kcal/mol with triple- and quadruple-zeta basis sets. It
appears that radial flexibility in the basis set is more important here than
adding angular momenta L: apparently, replacing nZaPa basis sets with
truncations of 7ZaPa at L=n gains about one angular momentum for small values

performant strategies are combined to create more performant strategies.
Mutations allow the algorithm to efficiently scan the space of possible

  Super-Resolution","14 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we present D2C-SR, a novel framework for the task of
real-world image super-resolution. As an ill-posed problem, the key challenge
in super-resolution related tasks is there can be multiple predictions for a
given low-resolution input. Most classical deep learning based approaches
ignored the fundamental fact and lack explicit modeling of the underlying
high-frequency distribution which leads to blurred results. Recently, some
methods of GAN-based or learning super-resolution space can generate simulated
textures but do not promise the accuracy of the textures which have low
quantitative performance. Rethinking both, we learn the distribution of
underlying high-frequency details in a discrete form and propose a two-stage
pipeline: divergence stage to convergence stage. At divergence stage, we
propose a tree-based structure deep network as our divergence backbone.
Divergence loss is proposed to encourage the generated results from the
tree-based network to diverge into possible high-frequency representations,
which is our way of discretely modeling the underlying high-frequency
distribution. At convergence stage, we assign spatial weights to fuse these
divergent predictions to obtain the final output with more accurate details.
Our approach provides a convenient end-to-end manner to inference. We conduct
evaluations on several real-world benchmarks, including a new proposed
D2CRealSR dataset with x8 scaling factor. Our experiments demonstrate that
D2C-SR achieves better accuracy and visual improvements against
state-of-the-art methods, with a significantly less parameters number and our
D2C structure can also be applied as a generalized structure to some other
methods to obtain improvement. Our codes and dataset are available at

analyzing the polarization of the probe photoluminescence pulse in the

probe pulse generated photoluminescence is strongly affected by the interaction
of hole spins with spins of Mn atoms polarized by the pump pulse. The latter
leads to decrease of circular polarization degree as compared with single pulse
excitation ($\delta P$ effect). The amplitude of $\delta P$-effect is most
strongly affected by the concentration of resident electrons in the quantum
well which is believed to be due the specific compliance with selection rules
for optical transition with the participation of unpolarized resident

analysis. To date, various strategies ranging from model-based approaches to
data-driven schemes, have been devised for efficient and accurate clustering.
One important class of clustering methods that is of a particular interest is
the class of exemplar-based approaches. This interest primarily stems from the
amount of compressed information encoded in these exemplars that effectively
reflect the major characteristics of the respective clusters. Affinity
propagation (AP) has proven to be a powerful exemplar-based approach that
refines the set of optimal exemplars by iterative pairwise message updates.
However, a critical limitation is its inability to capitalize on known
networked relations between data points often available for various scientific
datasets. To mitigate this shortcoming, we propose geometric-AP, a novel
clustering algorithm that effectively extends AP to take advantage of the
network topology. Geometric-AP obeys network constraints and uses max-sum
belief propagation to leverage the available network topology for generating
smooth clusters over the network. Extensive performance assessment reveals a
significant enhancement in the quality of the clustering results when compared
to benchmark clustering schemes. Especially, we demonstrate that geometric-AP
performs extremely well even in cases where the original AP fails drastically.

in many industrial applications, notably in the modelling of wind farms. While
the non-equilibrium high Reynolds number scalings present in the wake of

terms of wake interactions. We propose an experimental setup that tests the
presence of non-equilibrium turbulence using the streamwise variation of
velocity fluctuations between two bluff bodies facing a laminar flow. We have
studied two different sets of plates (one with regular and another with
irregular peripheries) with hot-wire anemometry in a wind tunnel. By acquiring
streamwise profiles for different plate separations and identifying the wake
interaction length for each separation it is possible to show that the
interaction between them is consistent with non-equilibrium scalings. This work
also generalises previous studies concerned with the interaction of plane wakes
to include axisymmetric wakes. We find that a simple mathematical expression
for the wake interaction length based on non-equilibrium turbulence scalings
can be used to collapse the streamwise developments of the second, third and
fourth moments of the streamwise fluctuating velocity.

approximations based on quadratic cross spectrum estimators: (i) a variant of
the simulation-based likelihood (SimBaL) techniques used in the Planck legacy
papers to produce a low multipole EE likelihood; (ii) a semi-analytical
likelihood approximation (momento) based on the principle of maximum entropy;
(iii) a density-estimation `likelihood-free' scheme (DELFI). Approaches (ii)
and (iii) can be generalised to produce low multipole joint
temperature-polarisation (TTTEEE) likelihoods. We present extensive tests of
these methods on simulations with realistic correlated noise. We then analyse
the Planck data and confirm the robustness of our method and likelihoods on
multiple inter- and intra-frequency detector set combinations of SRoll2 maps.
The three likelihood techniques give consistent results and support a low value
of the optical depth to reoinization, tau, from the HFI. Our best estimate of
tau comes from combining the low multipole SRoll2 momento (TTTEEE) likelihood
with the CamSpec high multipole likelihood and is tau = 0.0627+0.0050-0.0058.
This is consistent with the SRoll2 team's determination of tau, though slightly
higher by 0.5 sigma, mainly because of our joint treatment of temperature and

to guess the average of guesses multiplied by p. Convergence of plays to Nash
equilibrium has often been justified by agents' learning. However,
interrogations remain on the origin of reasoning types and equilibrium behavior
when learning takes place in unstable environments. When successive values of p
can take values above and below 1, bounded rational agents may learn about
their environment through simplified representations of the game, reasoning
with analogies and constructing expectations about the behavior of other
players. We introduce an evolutionary process of learning to investigate the
dynamics of learning and the resulting optimal strategies in unstable
p-guessing games environments with analogy partitions. As a validation of the
approach, we first show that our genetic algorithm behaves consistently with
previous results in persistent environments, converging to the Nash
equilibrium. We characterize strategic behavior in mixed regimes with unstable
values of p. Varying the number of iterations given to the genetic algorithm to
learn about the game replicates the behavior of agents with different levels of
reasoning of the level k approach. This evolutionary process hence proposes a
learning foundation for endogenizing existence and transitions between levels
of reasoning in cognitive hierarchy models.

space, where the system's energy saturates and the single-particle

of interactions, in the context of a periodically kicked Bose gas, it has been
argued that dynamical localization persists. Focusing on the Tonks (strongly
interacting) regime, we show that the many-body dynamically localized phase is
effectively thermal, a clear deviation from the breaking of ergodicity observed
in standard many-body localized systems. We relate the effective temperature to
the driving parameters, and thus quantitatively describe the loss of coherence
at large distances in this phase. Contrary to the non-interacting case, the
momentum distribution decays as a power-law at large momenta, characterized by
an effectively thermal Tan's contact. This is a rare example where driving and
many-body (dynamical) localization lead to an effectively ergodic state.

the presence of strong laser fields with a semiclassical (SC) method. In this
model, two nuclei with a given incident kinetic energy that closely approach
each other are simulated by tracing the classical Newtonian trajectories in the
combined Coulomb repulsive potentials and laser fields. At the nearest position
or classical turning point, quantum tunneling through the Coulomb barrier
emerges, and its penetrability is estimated with the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
formula. Nuclear fusion occurs after the tunneling, and the total fusion cross
section takes the Gamow form. We find that the tunneling penetrability can be
enhanced dramatically because the nuclei can closely approach each other due to
the quiver motion of the charged nuclei driven by the intense laser fields. We
then calculate the DT fusion section for a wide range of laser parameters
according to various incident nuclei kinetic energies and obtain the phase
diagrams for the enhanced DT fusion. We compare our SC results with the quantum
results of the Kramers-Henneberger approximation and the Volkov state

science and biology. Although experimental imperfections affect the
sensitivity, repetitions of the measurements decrease the estimation
uncertainty by a square root of the total number of the measurements if there
are only statistical errors. However, it is difficult to precisely characterize
the coherence time of the system because it fluctuates in time in realistic
conditions, which induces systematic errors. In this case, due to residual bias
of the measured values, estimation uncertainty cannot be lowered than a finite
value even in the limit of the infinite number of measurements. On the basis of
the fact that the decoherence dynamics in the so-called Zeno regime are not
significant compared to other regimes, we propose a novel but very simple
protocol to use measurements in the Zeno regime for reducing systematic errors.
Our scheme allows the estimation uncertainty $\delta ^2 \omega$ to scale as
$L^{1/4}$ where $L$ denotes the number of the measurements even when we cannot
precisely characterize the coherence time.

solutions to challenging domains such as robotics. Model-based RL shows the
prospect of being more sample-efficient than model-free methods in terms of

unseen situations. In the more recent past, model-based methods have shown
superior results compared to model-free methods in some challenging domains
with non-linear state transitions. At the same time, it has become apparent
that RL is not market-ready yet and that many real-world applications are going
to require model-based approaches, because model-free methods are too
sample-inefficient and show poor performance in early stages of training. The
latter is particularly important in industry, e.g. in production systems that
directly impact a company's revenue. This demonstrates the necessity for a

points are closed, but as time progresses points can become either frozen or
open. Points become open at their activation times provided they have not
become frozen before. Open points connect the parts of the tree below and above
it and one says that a point percolates if the tree above it is infinite. We
consider a version of frozen percolation on the MBBT in which at times of the

$\theta \to 1$, in which points freeze as soon as they percolate, has been
studied before by R\'ath, Swart, and Terpai. We extend their results by showing
that there exists a $0<\theta^\ast<1$ such that the model is endogenous for
$\theta \leq\theta^\ast$ but not for $\theta>\theta^\ast$. This means that for

insertion loss of the passband reach 0.51 and 0.99 , by alcohol drainage. It
can also reflect electromagnetic waves at 2.45 GHz and absorb them from 4.5 GHz
to 10.5 GHz with a strong absorptivity over 90% by alcohol injection,
exhibiting the reconfigurable electromagnetic characteristic of switching
between transmission state and absorption state. Furthermore, the proposed
absorber shows its good transmission/absorption performance under different
polarizations and obtains absorptivity over 90% when alcohol injection in an
oblique incidence of 50{\deg}. Finally, the prototype window has been
fabricated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed structure, which
indicates that the proposal presents significant implications for smart stealth

treated by both theory and experiment. When the squeezing force F is constant
and surface tension is neglected, the theory predicts ultimate growth of the
radius a~ t^{1/8}, in excellent agreement with our experiment. Surface tension
at the drop boundary is included in the analysis, although negligibly small in
the squeezing experiments. The circular evolution is found to be stable under
small perturbations. If the force is reversed (F < 0), so that the plates are
pulled or levered apart, the boundary of the drop is subject to a fingering
instability. The effect of a trapped air bubble at the centre of the drop is
then considered. The annular evolution of the drop under constant squeezing is
still found to follow a `one-eighth' power law, but this is unstable, the
instability originating at the boundary of the air bubble. If the plates are
drawn apart, the evolution is still subject to the fingering instability driven
from the outer boundary of the annulus. This instability is realised
experimentally by levering the plates apart at one corner: fingering develops
at the outer boundary and spreads rapidly to the interior as the levering is
slowly increased. At a later stage, small cavitation bubbles appear in the very
low pressure region far from the point of leverage. This exotic behaviour is
discussed in the light of the foregoing theoretical analysis.

finite-horizon covariance steering problem for discrete-time Gaussian linear
systems (DTGLS) which can reduce the latter stochastic optimal control problem
to a tractable optimization problem. The covariance steering problem seeks for
a feedback control policy that will steer the state covariance of a DTGLS to a
desired positive definite matrix in finite time. We consider two different
formulations of the covariance steering problem, one with hard terminal LMI
constraints (hard-constrained covariance steering) and another one with soft
terminal constraints in the form of a terminal cost which corresponds to the
squared Wasserstein distance between the actual terminal state (Gaussian)
distribution and the desired one (soft-constrained covariance steering). We
propose a solution approach that relies on the affine disturbance feedback
parametrization for both problem formulations. We show that this particular
parametrization allows us to reduce the hard-constrained covariance steering

a frame assembly.
  The quality of these sources, which depends upon the entire $^{207}$Bi

SuperNEMO's energy response. In this paper, we present a novel method for
precisely measuring the exact geometry of the deposition of $^{207}$Bi droplets

new avenue of research for weather forecasting. Here, we take the novel
approach of using a neural network to predict full probability density
functions at each point in space and time rather than a single output value,
thus producing a probabilistic weather forecast. This enables the calculation
of both uncertainty and skill metrics for the neural network predictions, and
overcomes the common difficulty of inferring uncertainty from these
predictions.
  This approach is data-driven and the neural network is trained on the
WeatherBench dataset (processed ERA5 data) to forecast geopotential and
temperature 3 and 5 days ahead. Data exploration leads to the identification of
the most important input variables, which are also found to agree with physical
reasoning, thereby validating our approach. In order to increase computational
efficiency further, each neural network is trained on a small subset of these
variables. The outputs are then combined through a stacked neural network, the
first time such a technique has been applied to weather data. Our approach is
found to be more accurate than some numerical weather prediction models and as
accurate as more complex alternative neural networks, with the added benefit of
providing key probabilistic information necessary for making informed weather
forecasts.

traditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be
lightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student
model consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its

this finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised

the denoising capability of a multimodal student.

machining, as it has a close relationship with machining time and surface

high chord errors and round-off errors, and generate continuous velocity,
acceleration, and jerk profile of parametric interpolation, a novel and
complete S-shape based feedrate scheduling algorithm is presented in this
paper. The algorithm consists of three modules: bidirectional scanning module,
velocity scheduling module and round-off error elimination module. The
bidirectional scanning module with the limitations of chord error, normal
acceleration/jerk and command feedrate aims to guarantee the continuity of the
feed rate at the junctions between successive NURBS sub-curves. After the NURBS
sub-curves have been classified into two cases, the velocity scheduling module
firstly calculates the actual maximum federate, and then generates the feed
rate profiles of all NURBS sub-curves according to our velocity scheduling
function. Later, the round-off error elimination module is proposed to make the
total interpolating time become an integer multiple of the interpolation
period, which leads to the elimination of round-off errors. Finally, benchmarks
are conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed method compared with
some other methods.

applications to benchmarking to privacy preservation. Generating the links
between relations, subject to cardinality constraints (CCs) and integrity
constraints (ICs) is an important aspect of this problem. Given instances of
two relations, where one has a foreign key dependence on the other and is
missing its foreign key ($FK$) values, and two types of constraints: (1) CCs
that apply to the join view and (2) ICs that apply to the table with missing
$FK$ values, our goal is to impute the missing $FK$ values such that the
constraints are satisfied. We provide a novel framework for the problem based
on declarative CCs and ICs. We further show that the problem is NP-hard and
propose a novel two-phase solution that guarantees the satisfaction of the ICs.
Phase I yields an intermediate solution accounting for the CCs alone, and
relies on a hybrid approach based on CC types. For one type, the problem is
modeled as an Integer Linear Program. For the others, we describe an efficient
and accurate solution. We then combine the two solutions. Phase II augments
this solution by incorporating the ICs and uses a coloring of the conflict
hypergraph to infer the values of the $FK$ column. Our extensive experimental
study shows that our solution scales well when the data and number of
constraints increases. We further show that our solution maintains low error

can be sampled by means of loop-erased random walks stopped at a random
exponential time of parameter $q>0$. The related random blocks tend to cluster
nodes visited by the random walk on time scale $1/q$. This random partitioning
is induced by a measure of rooted spanning forest of the graph, which
generalizes the classical uniform spanning tree measure and which can be
obtained as a zero-limit of FK-percolation with an external cemetery state.
Some general properties of this rooted forest measure and related determinantal
observables, along with a number of applications in data analysis have been
recently explored. We are here mainly interested in the structure the emergent
partitioning, referred to as loop-erased partitioning, as the scale parameter
$q$ varies.
  We first present two general results shedding light on subtle monoticity
properties in $q$ of these rooted forest and loop-erased partitioning measures.
The first theorem characterizes monotone events in $q$ by deriving a Russo-like
formula. Our second general result concerns two-point correlations defined by
the probability that two vertices do not belong to the same block of the
partitioning. It states that, on undirected graphs, these correlation functions
are increasing in $q$. We then explore other types of results aiming at
understanding the emerging asymptotic clusters on simple growing graph models,
as $q$ scales with the graph size. Some first results in this direction have
been investigated in the recent [arXiv:1906.03858] on dense geometries. Here we
look at very sparse graphs. We offer a detailed analysis of the resulting
partitioning on line segments and we look at trees and other tree-like

presence of magnetic field. This model introduces a temperature and magnetic
field-dependent degeneracy factor of partons, which is tuned by fitting the
entropy density of lattice quantum chromodynamics data. At a finite magnetic
field, ${\hat q}$ for quark jets splits into parallel and perpendicular
components whose magnetic field dependence comes from two sources: the
field-dependent degeneracy factor and the phase space part guided from the
shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. Due to the electrically neutral
nature of gluons, the estimation of $\hat{q}$ for gluon jets is affected only
by the field-dependent degeneracy factor. In presence of a finite magnetic
field, we find a significant enhancement in ${\hat q}$ for both quark and gluon
initiated jets at low temperature, which gradually decreases towards high
temperature. We compare the obtained results with the earlier calculations
based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, and a qualitatively similar trend is
observed. The change in $\hat{q}$ in presence of magnetic field is, however,
quantitatively different for quark and gluon jets. This is an interesting
observation which can be explored experimentally to verify the effect of

electromagnetic energy at confined modal volumes. Here, we theoretically
investigate how moving electrons can be used as a probe of hybrid
exciton-plasmon polaritons of gold-WSe2 multilayers within the context of
electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and cathodoluminescence (CL)
spectroscopy. Interestingly, and in contrast to WSe2 slab waveguides where
quasi-propagating photonic modes interact with only exciton A, in gold-WSe2
multilayer, exciton A and exciton B can both strongly interact with surface
plasmon polaritons. Hence, we observe CL emission suppression at excitonic or

plasmons in the form of nonradiating guided waves. Our work provides a
systematic study for deeper understanding of the effect of the configuration

approach is to represent data items as objects in the Hamming space where
operations can be done efficiently and effectively. Object similarity can then
be computed by learning binary representations (hash codes) of the objects and
computing their Hamming distance. While this is highly efficient, each bit
dimension is equally weighted, which means that potentially discriminative
information of the data is lost. A more expressive alternative is to use
real-valued vector representations and compute their inner product; this allows
varying the weight of each dimension but is many magnitudes slower. To fix
this, we derive a new way of measuring the dissimilarity between two objects in
the Hamming space with binary weighting of each dimension (i.e., disabling
bits): we consider a field-agnostic dissimilarity that projects the vector of
one object onto the vector of the other. When working in the Hamming space,
this results in a novel projected Hamming dissimilarity, which by choice of
projection, effectively allows a binary importance weighting of the hash code
of one object through the hash code of the other. We propose a variational
hashing model for learning hash codes optimized for this projected Hamming
dissimilarity, and experimentally evaluate it in collaborative filtering
experiments. The resultant hash codes lead to effectiveness gains of up to +7%
in NDCG and +14% in MRR compared to state-of-the-art hashing-based
collaborative filtering baselines, while requiring no additional storage and no
computational overhead compared to using the Hamming distance.

described by Cauchy continuum models with a Newtonian viscous rheology
dependent on the grain size. Such a continuum lacks the rotational degrees of
freedom needed to describe grain rotation. Here we provide a more general
continuum description of diffusion creep that includes grain rotation, and
identifies the deformation of the material with that of a micropolar (Cosserat)
fluid. We derive expressions for the micropolar constitutive tensors by a
homogenisation of the physics describing a discrete collection of rigid grains,
demanding an equivalent dissipation between the discrete and continuum
descriptions. General constitutive laws are derived for both Coble
(grain-boundary diffusion) and Nabarro-Herring (volume diffusion) creep.
Detailed calculations are performed for a two-dimensional tiling of irregular
hexagonal grains, which illustrates a potential coupling between the rotational
and translational degrees of freedom. If only the plating out or removal of
material at grain boundaries is considered, the constitutive laws are
degenerate: modes of deformation that involve pure tangential motion at the
grain boundaries are not resisted. This degeneracy can be removed by including
the resistance to grain-boundary sliding, or by imposing additional constraints
on the deformation.

and allows both efficient and effective similarity search in large-scale

hash codes that improve similarity search effectiveness, while assuming a
brute-force linear scan strategy for searching over all the hash codes, even
though much faster alternatives exist. One such alternative is multi-index
hashing, an approach that constructs a smaller candidate set to search over,
which depending on the distribution of the hash codes can lead to sub-linear
search time. In this work, we propose Multi-Index Semantic Hashing (MISH), an
unsupervised hashing model that learns hash codes that are both effective and
highly efficient by being optimized for multi-index hashing. We derive novel
training objectives, which enable to learn hash codes that reduce the candidate
sets produced by multi-index hashing, while being end-to-end trainable. In
fact, our proposed training objectives are model agnostic, i.e., not tied to
how the hash codes are generated specifically in MISH, and are straight-forward
to include in existing and future semantic hashing models. We experimentally
compare MISH to state-of-the-art semantic hashing baselines in the task of
document similarity search. We find that even though multi-index hashing also
improves the efficiency of the baselines compared to a linear scan, they are
still upwards of 33% slower than MISH, while MISH is still able to obtain

selects more plausible image reconstruction results among multiple hypotheses
without any training or supervision. Experimental results have in fact, shown
the advantage of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art

  (IEEE TNNLS)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Existing online knowledge distillation approaches either adopt the student
with the best performance or construct an ensemble model for better holistic
performance. However, the former strategy ignores other students' information,
while the latter increases the computational complexity during deployment. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for online knowledge distillation, termed
FFSD, which comprises two key components: Feature Fusion and Self-Distillation,
towards solving the above problems in a unified framework. Different from
previous works, where all students are treated equally, the proposed FFSD
splits them into a leader student and a common student set. Then, the feature
fusion module converts the concatenation of feature maps from all common
students into a fused feature map. The fused representation is used to assist
the learning of the leader student. To enable the leader student to absorb more
diverse information, we design an enhancement strategy to increase the
diversity among students. Besides, a self-distillation module is adopted to
convert the feature map of deeper layers into a shallower one. Then, the
shallower layers are encouraged to mimic the transformed feature maps of the
deeper layers, which helps the students to generalize better. After training,
we simply adopt the leader student, which achieves superior performance, over
the common students, without increasing the storage or inference cost.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of
our FFSD over existing works. The code is available at

from a complicated teacher network to a compact student network and maintaining
the strong performance. Different from image classification, object detectors

semantic information rely on are tangled. In this paper, we point out that the
information of features derived from regions excluding objects are also
essential for distilling the student detector, which is usually ignored in
existing approaches. In addition, we elucidate that features from different
regions should be assigned with different importance during distillation. To
this end, we present a novel distillation algorithm via decoupled features
(DeFeat) for learning a better student detector. Specifically, two levels of
decoupled features will be processed for embedding useful information into the
student, i.e., decoupled features from neck and decoupled proposals from
classification head. Extensive experiments on various detectors with different
backbones show that the proposed DeFeat is able to surpass the state-of-the-art

clusters that are, in turn, part of a space-spanning percolated network. In
practice, the microstructure of colloidal gels, which dictates their mechanical
properties, strongly depends on the particle concentration and on the nature of
their interactions. Yet another critical control parameter is the shear history
experienced by the sample, which controls the size and density of the cluster
population, via particle aggregation, cluster breakup, and restructuring. Here
we investigate the impact of shear history on acid-induced gels of boehmite, an
aluminum oxide. We show that following a primary gelation, these gels display a
dual response depending on the shear rate $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}$ used to
rejuvenate their microstructure. We identify a critical shear rate
$\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$, above which boehmite gels display a gel-like viscoelastic
spectrum upon flow cessation, similar to that obtained following the primary
gelation. However, upon flow cessation after shear rejuvenation below
$\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$, boehmite gels display a glassy-like viscoelastic spectrum
together with enhanced elastic properties. Moreover, the nonlinear rheological
properties of boehmite gels also differ on both sides of $\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$:
weak gels obtained after rejuvenation at $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}>\dot\gamma_{\rm
c}$ show a yield strain that is constant, independent of $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}$,
whereas strong gels obtained with $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}<\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$
display a yield strain that significantly increases with $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}$.
Our results can be interpreted in light of previous literature on shear-induced
anisotropy, while we rationalize the critical shear rate in terms of a
dimensionless quantity, the Mason number, comparing the strength of the shear
flow to the interparticle bond force.

this purpose, our study focuses on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)

an advantage in adapting the distribution of entangling gates to the problem's

leads to the formation of a localized exciton state, which mimics the spatial
distribution of the electromagnetic field of the resonator. The localized
exciton state is in turn coupled to an environment of residual exciton states.
We quantify the influence of the environment and find that it is most
pronounced for small lateral confinement length scales of the electromagnetic
field in the resonator, and that environmental effects can be neglected if this
length scale is sufficiently large. The microscopic theory provides a
physically appealing derivation of the coupled oscillator models widely used to
model experiments on these types of systems, in which all observable quantities
are directly derived from the material parameters and the properties of the

recovers the results of semiclassical electromagnetic calculations and

can efficiently run on edge devices, but existing training methods for these

energy budget. For example, quantisation-aware training (QAT) method involves
two copies of model parameters, which is usually beyond the capacity of on-chip
memory in edge devices. Data movement between off-chip and on-chip memory is
energy demanding as well. The resource requirements are trivial for powerful

Resource Constrained Training (RCT). RCT only keeps a quantised model
throughout the training, so that the memory requirements for model parameters
in training is reduced. It adjusts per-layer bitwidth dynamically in order to
save energy when a model can learn effectively with lower precision. We carry
out experiments with representative models and tasks in image application and
natural language processing. Experiments show that RCT saves more than 86\%

model parameters, with limited accuracy loss. Comparing with QAT-based method,
RCT saves about half of energy on moving model parameters.

proposed a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework with an alignment module

termination of agent search in RL is important and affects the practical
deployment. In this study, we enhance our previous RL framework with a newly

searching, saving at most 67% inference time, thus boosting the accuracy and

benchmarks. Nonetheless, such simulations are of great interest. This work aims
to provide a numerical study, checking whether its solution indeed converges

parameters, this work conducts a sensitivity analysis and also assesses its
applicability to more complex scenarios, as such issues remain open in the
literature. In order to do that, a simple model that can be easily adapted for
mixed formulations and complex geometries was proposed. It was found out that
when considering unidimensional models the choices regarding the interpolation
of the sorption isotherms are not essential to the numerical stability of the
system. Besides that, the permeability and thermal conductivity of the material
are the most important parameters that affect the simulation results of
pressure, temperature and evaporable water content profiles. Finally, the 2D
mesoscale simulation of concrete with polymeric fibers (based on the mixed

computationally expensive and adding new speakers to the dataset requires the

phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we look at TTS
modeling from a continual learning perspective, where the goal is to add new
speakers without forgetting previous speakers. Therefore, we first propose an
experimental setup and show that serial fine-tuning for new speakers can cause
the forgetting of the earlier speakers. Then we exploit two well-known
techniques for continual learning, namely experience replay and weight
regularization. We reveal how one can mitigate the effect of degradation in
speech synthesis diversity in sequential training of new speakers using these

the results in extreme setups where we have access to very small buffers.

obtain the model parameters (layer weights and biases). A well-thought
initialization of these model parameters can often avoid that the nonlinear
optimization algorithm converges to a poorly performing local minimum of the

approach for nonlinear state-space models represented as a recurrent artificial

starting from a linear approximation of the nonlinear system, while others are

still defies detailed physical understanding. It is particularly evident in
cataclysmic variables (CVs). Attempting to define boundary conditions for
models, the strength of the flickering is measured in several thousand light
curves of more than 100 CVs. The flickering amplitude is parameterized by the
FWHM of a Gaussian fit to the magnitude distribution of data points in a light
curve. This quantity requires several corrections before a comparison between
different sources can be made. While no correlations of the flickering strength
with simple parameters such as component masses, orbital inclination or period
were detected, a dependence on the absolute magnitude of the primary component
and on the CV subtype is found. In particular, flickering in VY Scl tpye
novalike variables is systematically stronger than in UX UMa type novalikes.
The broadband spectrum of the flickering light source can be fit by simple
models but shows excess in the $U$ band. When the data permitted to investigate
the flickering strength as a function of orbital phase in eclipsing CVs, such a
dependence was found, but it is different for different systems. Surprisingly,
there are also indications for variations of the flickering strength with the
superhump phase in novalike variables with permanent superhumps. In dwarf
novae, the flickering amplitude is high during quiescence, drops quickly at an
intermediate magnitude when the system enters into (or returns from) an
outburst and, on average, remains constant above a given brightness threshold.

Open Access has led to many journals converting, or 'flipping', from a closed

model can influence the decision of authors to submit their papers to a
journal, and increased article accessibility may influence citation behaviour.
In this paper we aimed to understand how flipping a journal to an OA model
influences the journal's future publication volumes and citation impact. We
analysed two independent sets of journals that had flipped to an OA model, one
from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and one from the Open Access
Directory (OAD), and compared their development with two respective control
groups of similar journals. For bibliometric analyses, journals were matched to
the Scopus database. We assessed changes in the number of articles published
over time, as well as two citation metrics at the journal and article level:
the normalised impact factor (IF) and the average relative citations (ARC),
respectively. Our results show that overall, journals that flipped to an OA
model increased their publication output compared to journals that remained
closed. Mean normalised IF and ARC also generally increased following the flip
to an OA model, at a greater rate than was observed in the control groups.
However, the changes appear to vary largely by scientific discipline. Overall,
these results indicate that flipping to an OA publishing model can bring
positive changes to a journal.

investigated by temperature and magnetic-field dependent specific heat,
susceptibility and neutron diffraction experiments on single crystals.
Considering only the two nearest-neighbour magnetic interactions, the system
forms a $J_1$, $J_2$ magnetic chain but more extended interactions are
sizeable. Two different magnetic phases exhibiting long-range incommensurate
order evolve at $T_{\text{N}1}\approx 22.2 \text{ K}$ and $T_{\text{N}2}\approx
19 \text{ K}$. First, a spin-density wave develops with moments lying in the
$ac$ plane. In its multiferroic phase below $T_{\text{N}2}$, LiFe(WO$_4$)$_2$
exhibits a spiral arrangement with an additional spin-component along $b$.
Therefore, the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism fully explains the
multiferroic behavior in this material. A partially unbalanced multiferroic
domain distribution was observed even in the absence of an applied electric
field. For both phases only a slight temperature dependence of the
incommensurability was observed and there is no commensurate phase emerging at
low temperature or at finite magnetic fields up to $6\text{ T}$.
LiFe(WO$_4$)$_2$ thus exhibits a simple phase diagram with the typical sequence
of transitions for a type-II multiferroic material.

[Ir/Fe/Co/Pt] multilayer hosting N\'eel skyrmions at room temperature.
Experiments reveal two distinct resonances of the skyrmion phase during
in-plane ac excitation, with frequencies between 6-12 GHz. Complementary
micromagnetic simulations indicate that the net magnetic dipole moment rotates
counterclockwise (CCW) during both resonances. The magnon probability
distribution for the lower-frequency resonance is localised within isolated
skyrmions, unlike the higher-frequency mode which principally originates from
areas between skyrmions. However, the properties of both modes depend
sensitively on the out-of-plane dipolar coupling, which is controlled via the
ferromagnetic layer spacing in our heterostructures. The gyrations of stable
isolated skyrmions reported in this room temperature study encourage the
development of new material platforms and applications based on skyrmion
resonances. Moreover, our material architecture enables the resonance spectra
to be tuned, thus extending the functionality of such applications over a
broadband frequency range.

of these colloidal clusters as a function of the number of their constituent
building blocks for system sizes up to several thousand particles. We find that
minima in the free energy landscape, arising from the presence of filled,

analogues, colloidal clusters in spherical confinement can flexibly accommodate
excess colloids by ordering icosahedrally in the cluster center while changing
the structure near the cluster surface. In-between these magic number regions,
the building blocks cannot arrange into filled shells. Instead, we observe that
defects accumulate in a single wedge and therefore only affect a few
tetrahedral grains of the cluster. We predict the existence of this wedge by
simulation and confirm its presence in experiment using electron tomography.
The introduction of the wedge minimizes the free energy penalty by confining
defects to small regions within the cluster. In addition, the remaining ordered

modes that are characterized by the current-driven hydromagnetic waves that
they allow, namely a magneto-deflagration and magneto-detonation respectively.
These modes can be chosen by changing the time propellant is allowed to diffuse
into the thruster based on the desired performance. Using time-of-flight
emission diagnostics to characterize near-field flow velocities, we find that a
relatively dramatic transition occurs between modes, with exhaust velocities
ranging from 10 km/s to 55 km/s in deflagration and detonation regimes,
respectively. Simulations of the processed mass bit offers a first glimpse into
possible thruster performance confirming a broad range and tradeoff between
specific impulse (2600 - 5600 sec) and thrust (up to 31 mN) when operating in a
burst mode.

The (iterative) solving of the network and the (repeated) storage of the
unknown tensors requires a computing power growing polynomially with the size
of basis of the one-body Hilbert space one is working with. Thanks to current
computer capabilities, ab initio calculations of nuclei up to mass $A\sim100$
delivering a few percent accuracy are routinely feasible today. However, the
runtime and memory costs become quickly prohibitive as one attempts (possibly
at the same time) (i) to reach out to heavier nuclei, (ii) to employ
symmetry-breaking reference states to access open-shell nuclei and (iii) to aim
for yet a greater accuracy. The challenge is particularly exacerbated for
non-perturbative methods involving the repeated storage of (high-rank) tensors
obtained via iterative solutions of non-linear equations. The present work
addresses the formal and numerical implementations of so-called importance
truncation (IT) techniques within the frame of one particular non-perturbative
expansion method, i.e., Gorkov Self-Consistent Green's Function (GSCGF) theory,
with the goal to eventually overcome above-mentioned limitations. By a priori
truncating irrelevant tensor entries, IT techniques are shown to reduce the
storage to less than 1% of its original cost in realistic GSCGF calculations
performed at the ADC(2) level while maintaining a 1% accuracy on the
correlation energy. The future steps will be to extend the present development
to the next, e.g., ADC(3), truncation level and to SCGF calculations applicable

simple randomized signature-free binary consensus algorithm (denoted here MMR)
that copes with the net effect of asynchrony Byzantine behaviors. Assuming
message scheduling is fair and independent from random numbers MMR is optimal
in several respects: it deals with up to t Byzantine processes where t < n/3
and n is the number of processes, O(n\^2) messages and O(1) expected time. The
present article presents a non-trivial extension of MMR to an even more
fault-prone context, namely, in addition to Byzantine processes, it considers
also that the system can experience transient failures. To this end it
considers self-stabilization techniques to cope with communication failures and
arbitrary transient faults (such faults represent any violation of the
assumptions according to which the system was designed to operate).
  The proposed algorithm is the first loosely-self-stabilizing Byzantine
fault-tolerant binary consensus algorithm suited to asynchronous
message-passing systems. This is achieved via an instructive transformation of
MMR to a self-stabilizing solution that can violate safety requirements with
probability Pr= O(1/(2\^M)), where M is a predefined constant that can be set
to any positive integer at the cost of 3 M n + log M bits of local memory. In
addition to making MMR resilient to transient faults, the obtained
self-stabilizing algorithm preserves its properties of optimal resilience and
termination, (i.e., t < n/3, and O(1) expected time). Furthermore, it only
requires a bounded amount of memory.

of individual time series are relatively short and single-source transfer

multi-source deep transfer learning for financial time series. We propose two
multi-source transfer learning methods namely Weighted Average Ensemble for

While the normal and shear forces and moment are readily found from equilibrium
considerations, in order to determine the bulk stresses we must exploit details
of the traction ratio and the direct strain within the contact, both of which
are readily extracted from simulations. These contact loads enable the
formulation of an equivalent half-plane problem for the contact, which can be
used to determine much more precise estimates of the slip-zone sizes than are
obtainable from direct use of frictional finite element analysis, as aggregated

thereby laying the foundation for understanding the physical nature of
information. Szilard's information engine still serves as a canonical example
after almost a hundred years, despite recent significant growth of the area.
The role the demon plays can be reduced to mapping observable data to a
meta-stable memory, which is utilized to extract work. While Szilard showed
that the map can be implemented mechanistically, it was chosen a priori. The
choice of how to construct a meaningful memory constitutes the demon's
intelligence. Recently, it was shown that this can be automated as well. To
that end, generalized, partially observable information engines were
introduced, providing a basis for understanding the physical nature of
information processing. Partial observability is ubiquitous in real world
systems which have limited sensor types and information acquisition bandwidths.
Generalized information engines can run work extraction at a different
temperature, T' > T, from the memory forming process. This enables the combined
treatment of heat engines and information engines. We study the physical
characteristics of intelligent observers by introducing a canonical model that
displays physical richness, despite its simplicity. A minor change to Szilard's
engine - inserting the divider at an angle - results in a family of partially
observable Szilard engines. Their analysis shows how the demon's intelligence
can be automated. For each angle, and for each value of T'/T, an optimal memory
can be found, enabling the engine to run with minimal dissipation. Those
optimal memories are probabilistic maps, computed algorithmically. We discuss
how they can be implemented with a simple physical system, characterize their
performance, and compare their quality to that of naive, deterministic
quantizations of the observable.

domain to an unlabeled target domain by reducing the cross-domain distribution
discrepancy. Most prior DA approaches leverage complicated and powerful deep
neural networks to improve the adaptation capacity and have shown remarkable
success. However, they may have a lack of applicability to real-world
situations such as real-time interaction, where low target inference latency is
an essential requirement under limited computational budget. In this paper, we
tackle the problem by proposing a dynamic domain adaptation (DDA) framework,
which can simultaneously achieve efficient target inference in low-resource
scenarios and inherit the favorable cross-domain generalization brought by DA.
In contrast to static models, as a simple yet generic method, DDA can integrate
various domain confusion constraints into any typical adaptive network, where
multiple intermediate classifiers can be equipped to infer ""easier"" and
""harder"" target data dynamically. Moreover, we present two novel strategies to
further boost the adaptation performance of multiple prediction exits: 1) a
confidence score learning strategy to derive accurate target pseudo labels by
fully exploring the prediction consistency of different classifiers; 2) a
class-balanced self-training strategy to explicitly adapt multi-stage
classifiers from source to target without losing prediction diversity.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks are conducted to verify that DDA
can consistently improve the adaptation performance and accelerate target
inference under domain shift and limited resources scenarios

equilibrium are frequently used to validate models and their parametrizations.
Good agreement with experiment during discharge is easily attained with a
pseudo-two-dimensional model such as the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model. The
relaxation portion, however, is typically not well-reproduced, with the
relaxation in experiments occurring much more slowly than in models. In this
study, using a model that includes a size distribution of the active material
particles, we give a physical explanation for the slow relaxation phenomenon.
This model, the Many-Particle-DFN (MP-DFN), is compared against discharge and
relaxation data from the literature, and optimal fits of the size distribution
parameters (mean and variance), as well as solid-state diffusivities, are found
using numerical optimization. The voltage after relaxation is captured by
careful choice of the current cut-off time, allowing a single set of physical
parameters to be used for all C-rates, in contrast to previous studies. We find
that the MP-DFN can accurately reproduce the slow relaxation, across a range of
C-rates, whereas the DFN cannot. Size distributions allow for greater internal
heterogeneities, giving a natural origin of slower relaxation timescales that
may be relevant in other, as yet explained, battery behavior.

submicroscopic consideration of particles and their motion in the framework of
the theory of physical space in the form of a tessellattice developed by Michel
Bounias and the author. The periodical change of the particle's charged state
to its monopole state can easily be introduced in the conventional Maxwell
equations and the magnetic monopole automatically shows up in the structure of
Maxwell's equations. The monopole is also presented in any quark system as a
quark obeys dynamics that are also characterized by the appropriate de Broglie
wavelength and hence the electric charge changes periodically to the magnetic
monopole. A (anti)neutrino emerges as the typical electron's monopole. When the
charged particle becomes the monopole, it also loses its mass (the mass passes
to the particle's inerton cloud) and thus the neutrino is a massless particle,
