emotion recognition (SER), they are severely restricted due to the paucity of
labeled data for training. Recently, segment-based approaches for SER have been
evolving, which train backbone networks on shorter segments instead of whole
utterances, and thus naturally augments training examples without additional
resources. However, one core challenge remains for segment-based approaches:
most emotional corpora do not provide ground-truth labels at the segment level.
To supervisely train a segment-based emotion model on such datasets, the most
common way assigns each segment the corresponding utterance's emotion label.
However, this practice typically introduces noisy (incorrect) labels as
emotional information is not uniformly distributed across the whole utterance.
On the other hand, DNNs have been shown to easily over-fit a dataset when being
trained with noisy labels. To this end, this work proposes a simple and
effective deep self-learning (DSL) framework, which comprises a procedure to
progressively correct segment-level labels in an iterative learning manner. The
DSL method produces dynamically-generated and soft emotion labels, leading to
significant performance improvements. Experiments on three well-known emotional
corpora demonstrate noticeable gains using the proposed method.

potential flow equation, which is a simplification of the Euler System.
  In the work of M. Feldman and G. Chen, the existence theory of shock
reflection problems with the potential flow equation was established, when the
wedge is symmetric w.r.t. the direction of the upstream flow. As a natural
extension, we study non-symmetric cases, i.e. when the direction of the
upstream flow forms a nonzero angle with the symmetry axis of the wedge.
  The main idea of investigating the existence of solutions to non-symmetric
problems is to study the symmetry of the solution. Then difficulties arise such
as free boundaries and degenerate ellipticity, especially when ellipticity
degenerates on the free boundary. We developed an integral method to overcome
these difficulties.
  Some estimates near the corner of wedge is also established, as an extension
of G.Lieberman's work.
  We proved that in non-symmetric cases, the ideal Lipschitz solution to the
potential flow equation, which we call regular solution, does not exist. This
suggests that the potential flow solutions to the non-symmetric shock
reflection problem, should have some singularity which is not encountered in
symmetric case.

method for the study of multistability in a turbulent flow without stochastic

flow, as well as their probability and rate of occurrence are systematically
computed using \emph{Adaptive Multilevel Splitting} (AMS). The AMS computations
are performed in a system of size $L_x\times L_z=24\times 18$ at Reynolds
number $R=370$ with an acceleration by a factor $\mathcal{O}(10)$ with respect
to DNS and in a system of size $L_x\times L_z=36\times 27$ at Reynolds number
$R=377$ with an acceleration by a factor $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. The AMS results
are validated with a comparison to DNS in the system of size $L_x\times
L_z=24\times 18$. Visualisations in both systems indicate that turbulence
collapses because the self sustaining process of turbulence fails locally. The
streamwise vortices decay first in streamwise elongated holes, leaving
streamwise invariant streamwise velocity tubes that experience viscous decay.
These holes then extend in the spanwise direction. The examination of more than
a thousand of trajectories in the $(E_{c,x}=\int u_x^2/2\,{\rm

the system of size $L_x\times L_z=24\times 18$ confirms the faster decay of
streamwise vortices and shows concentration of trajectory. This hints at an
instanton phenomenology in the large size limit. The computation of turning
point states, beyond which laminarisation is certain, confirms the hole
formation scenario and shows that it is more pronounced in larger systems.
Finally, the examination of non reactive trajectories, where a hole opens then
closes, indicates that hole opening and closing are distinct processes. Both
the vortices and the streaks reform concomitantly when the laminar holes close.

greenhouse gases, O$_3$, N$_2$O and CH$_4$, are also suppressed, but much less
so. For CF$_4$ and SF$_6$, the suppression is less than an order of magnitude
because the concentrations of these gases is very low. For current
concentrations, the per-molecule forcings are two to four orders of magnitude
greater for O$_3$, N$_2$O, CH$_4$, CF$_4$ and SF$_6$ than those of H$_2$O or

increases the forcings by a few per cent. A concentration increase of either
CF$_4$ or SF$_6$ by a factor of 100 yields a forcing nearly an order of
magnitude smaller than that obtained by doubling CO$_2$. Important insight was
obtained using a harmonic oscillator model to estimate the power radiated per

local net of von Neumann algebras. There are few methods of showing directly
strong locality of a quantum field. Among them, linear energy bounds are the
most widely used, yet a chiral conformal field of conformal weight $d>2$ cannot
admit linear energy bounds. In this paper we give a new direct method to prove
strong locality in two-dimensional conformal field theory. We prove that if a
chiral conformal field satisfies an energy bound of degree $d-1$, then it also
satisfies a certain local version of the energy bound, and this in turn implies
strong locality. A central role in our proof is played by diffeomorphism
symmetry. As a concrete application, we show that the vertex operator algebra
given by a unitary vacuum representation of the $\mathcal{W}_3$-algebra is
strongly local. For central charge $c > 2$, this yields a new conformal net. We
further prove that these nets do not satisfy strong additivity, and hence are
not completely rational.

ad-invariant metric. We prove that uniqueness of the metric on a complex Lie

Eventown theorem states that if $\ell=2$ then $|\mathcal{F}|\leq 2^{\lfloor

construction, i.e. splitting the ground set into disjoint pairs and taking
their arbitrary unions. Similarly, splitting the ground set into disjoint sets
of size $\ell$ gives a family with pairwise intersections divisible by $\ell$
and size $2^{\lfloor n/\ell\rfloor}$. Yet, as was shown by Frankl and Odlyzko,
these families are far from maximal. For infinitely many $\ell$, they
constructed families $\mathcal{F}$ as above of size $2^{\Omega(n\log

show that $|\mathcal{F}|\leq 2^{\lfloor n/\ell\rfloor}$. In 1983 Frankl and

resolve this old conjecture in a strong form, showing that $|\mathcal{F}|\leq

error term is not needed if (and only if) $\ell \, | \, n$, and $n$ is
sufficiently large. Moreover the only extremal configurations have `atomic'

general relativity to be performed on strong, dynamical gravitational fields.
These tests require accurate waveform models of the gravitational-wave signal,
otherwise waveform errors can erroneously suggest evidence for new physics.
Existing waveforms are generally thought to be accurate enough for current
observations, and each of the events observed to date appears to be
individually consistent with general relativity. In the near future, with
larger gravitational-wave catalogs, it will be possible to perform more
stringent tests of gravity by analyzing large numbers of events together.
However, there is a danger that waveform errors can accumulate among events:
even if the waveform model is accurate enough for each individual event, it can
still yield erroneous evidence for new physics when applied to a large catalog.
This paper presents a simple linearised analysis, in the style of a Fisher
matrix calculation, that reveals the conditions under which the apparent
evidence for new physics due to waveform errors grows as the catalog size
increases. We estimate that, in the worst-case scenario, evidence for a
deviation from general relativity might appear in some tests using a catalog
containing as few as 10-30 events above a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. This is
close to the size of current catalogs and highlights the need for caution when
performing these sorts of experiments.

To investigate the contact mechanics involved in RF and FF, we then measure the

fingerpad during sliding at a constant velocity under three different normal

supported by our mechanical measurements; the relative change in friction, the

two random forest approaches were compared with a state-of-the-art deep

generalize to multiple tasks due to the vast discrepancies among pixel
intensities, image appearances, and object shapes in different medical tasks.
To automate medical data augmentation, we propose a regularized adversarial
training framework via two min-max objectives and three differentiable
augmentation models covering affine transformation, deformation, and appearance
changes. Our method is more automatic and efficient than previous automatic
augmentation methods, which still rely on pre-defined operations with
human-specified ranges and costly bi-level optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach, with less training overhead, achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art auto-augmentation methods on both tasks of 2D

boundary and an upper boundary with a fixed heat flux. The quantity $\langle wT

transport, and also to $\frac12$ plus the mean temperature difference between
the top and bottom boundaries. An analytical application of the background

$\langle w T \rangle \leq \tfrac{1}{2}\big(\tfrac{1}{2}+ \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}

may lead to noticeable misalignment between the estimated meshes and image

Feedback (PyMAF) loop to leverage a feature pyramid and rectify the predicted
parameters explicitly based on the mesh-image alignment status in our deep
regressor. In PyMAF, given the currently predicted parameters, mesh-aligned
evidences will be extracted from finer-resolution features accordingly and fed
back for parameter rectification. To reduce noise and enhance the reliability
of these evidences, an auxiliary pixel-wise supervision is imposed on the
feature encoder, which provides mesh-image correspondence guidance for our
network to preserve the most related information in spatial features. The
efficacy of our approach is validated on several benchmarks, including
Human3.6M, 3DPW, LSP, and COCO, where experimental results show that our
approach consistently improves the mesh-image alignment of the reconstruction.

BSM physics in vector boson scattering (VBS). For Wilson coefficients which are
large enough to produce presently observable effects, the validity range of the
EFT represents only a fraction of the energy range covered by the LHC, however.
In order to shed light on possible extrapolations into the high energy region,
a class of UV-complete toy models, with extra SU(2) multiplets of scalars or of
fermions with vector-like weak couplings, is considered. By calculating the
Wilson coefficients up to energy-dimension eight, and full one-loop
contributions to VBS due to the heavy multiplets, the EFT approach, with and
without unitarization at high energy, is compared to the perturbative
prediction. For high multiplicities, e.g. nonets of fermions, the toy models
predict sizable effects in transversely polarized VBS, but only outside the
validity range of the EFT. At lower energies, dimension-eight operators are
needed for an adequate description of the models, providing another example
that dimension-eight can be more important than dimension-six operators. A
simplified VBFNLO implementation is used to estimate sensitivity of VBS to such
BSM effects at the LHC. Unitarization captures qualitative features of the toy
models at high energy but significantly underestimates signal cross sections in
the threshold region of the new particles.

applications. To obtain a human-explainable data intelligence model for
decision making, in this study, we investigate explainable fuzzy-theoretic
utility mining on multi-sequences. Meanwhile, a more normative formulation of
the problem of fuzzy utility mining on sequences is formulated. By exploring
fuzzy set theory for utility mining, we propose a novel method termed pattern
growth fuzzy utility mining (PGFUM) for mining fuzzy high-utility sequences
with linguistic meaning. In the case of sequence data, PGFUM reflects the fuzzy
quantity and utility regions of sequences. To improve the efficiency and
feasibility of PGFUM, we develop two compressed data structures with
explainable fuzziness. Furthermore, one existing and two new upper bounds on
the explainable fuzzy utility of candidates are adopted in three proposed
pruning strategies to substantially reduce the search space and thus expedite
the mining process. Finally, the proposed PGFUM algorithm is compared with
PFUS, which is the only currently available method for the same task, through
extensive experimental evaluation. It is demonstrated that PGFUM achieves not
only human-explainable mining results that contain the original nature of
revealable intelligibility, but also high efficiency in terms of runtime and
memory cost.

systems is still not fully understood theoretically. Mode-coupling theory (MCT)
has shown to be effective in describing some of the non-trivial features of
glass formation, but it cannot explain the full glassy phenomenology due to the
strong approximations on which it is based. Generalized mode-coupling theory
(GMCT) is a hierarchical extension of the theory, which is able to outclass MCT
by carefully describing the dynamics of higher order correlations in its
generalized framework. Unfortunately, the theory has so far only been developed
for single component systems and as a result works poorly for highly
polydisperse materials. In this paper, we solve this problem by developing GMCT
for multi-component systems. We use it to predict the glassy dynamics of the
binary Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones mixture, as well as its purely repulsive
Weeks-Chandler-Andersen analogue. Our results show that each additional level
of the GMCT hierarchy gradually improves the predictive power of GMCT beyond
its previous limit. This implies that our theory is able to harvest more
information from the static correlations, thus being able to better understand
the role of attraction in supercooled liquids from a first-principles
perspective.

movement. Experiments show that under the effect of a chemical stimulus, the
movement of bacteria is a combination of a transport with a constant velocity,
\emph{""run""}, and a random change in the direction of the movement,
\emph{""tumble""}. This so-called \emph{velocity jump process} can be described
by a kinetic-transport equation. We focus on the situation for bacteria called
\emph{E. Coli} where the tumbling rate depends on a chemical stimulus but the
post tumbling velocities do not.
  In this paper, we show that the linear run and tumble equation converges to a
unique steady state solution with an exponential rate in a weighted total
variation distance in dimension $d\geq 1$. We provide a constructive and
quantitative proof by using Harris's Theorem from ergodic theory of Markov
processes. The result is an improvement of a recent paper by Mischler and Weng
\cite{MW17}, since we are able to remove the radial symmetry assumption on the
chemoattractant concentration. We also consider a \emph{weakly non-linear} run
and tumble equation by coupling it with a nonlocal equation on the
chemoattractant concentration. We construct a unique stationary solution for
the weakly non-linear equation and show the exponential convergence towards it.
The novelty of our paper consist in our generalisation of the spectral gap
result to dimension $d\geq 1$ under relaxed assumptions and the methods we used
in the linear setting; and, all the results in the non-linear setting.

requires only sparse depth information in one of the images, which is often the
only available depth source in visual-inertial odometry or Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) pipelines. In an optional subsequent step, the
framework further refines feature locations and the relative pose using
individual feature alignment and bundle adjustment for pose and structure
re-alignment. The resulting sparse point correspondences with subpixel-accuracy
and refined relative pose can be used for depth map generation, or the image
alignment module can be embedded in an odometry or mapping framework.

145 ms per image pair with a resolution of 752 x 480 pixels each, and vastly
outperforms the classical, sparse 6DoF-ICLK algorithm, making it the ideal

used $3.6\times10^9$ simulations of planetary transits around spotted stars
using the transit-starspot model \prism. The simulations cover a range of
starspot filling factors using one of three distributions: uniform,
polar-biased, and mid-latitude. After construction of the stellar disc and
starspots, we checked the transit cord for starspots and examined the change in
flux of each starspot to determine whether or not a starspot anomaly would be
detected. The results were then compared to predicted planetary detections for
TESS. The results show that for the case of a uniform starspot distribution,
$64\pm9$ M dwarf and $23\pm4$ K dwarf transit light curves observed by TESS
will contain a starspot anomaly. This reduces to $37\pm6$ M dwarf and $12\pm2$
K dwarf light curves for a polar-biased distribution and $47\pm7$ M dwarf and
$21\pm4$ K dwarf light curves for a mid-latitude distribution. Currently there
are only 17 M dwarf and 10 K dwarf confirmed planetary systems from TESS, none
of which are confirmed as showing starspot anomalies. All three starspot
distributions can explain the current trend. However, with such a small sample,
a firm conclusion can not be made at present. In the coming years when more
TESS M and K dwarf exoplanetary systems have been detected and characterised,
it will be possible to determine the dominant starspot distribution.

present and planned experiments. There are at least two well studied mechanisms
of the low-scale leptogenesis: baryogenesis via oscillations and resonant

this identification in somewhat more detail by showing explicitly that the
Connes--van Suijlekom isomorphism is a unital complete order isomorphism of

examined, yielding two special results of note: (i) that every positive linear

the positivity of block Toeplitz matrices, which are viewed herein as elements

trainable subnetworks, or winning tickets, which can be trained in isolation to
achieve similar or even better performance compared to the full models. Despite
many efforts being made, the most effective method to identify such winning
tickets is still Iterative Magnitude-based Pruning (IMP), which is
computationally expensive and has to be run thoroughly for every different
network. A natural question that comes in is: can we ""transform"" the winning
ticket found in one network to another with a different architecture, yielding
a winning ticket for the latter at the beginning, without re-doing the
expensive IMP? Answering this question is not only practically relevant for
efficient ""once-for-all"" winning ticket finding, but also theoretically
appealing for uncovering inherently scalable sparse patterns in networks. We
conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and propose a variety
of strategies to tweak the winning tickets found from different networks of the
same model family (e.g., ResNets). Based on these results, we articulate the
Elastic Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (E-LTH): by mindfully replicating (or
dropping) and re-ordering layers for one network, its corresponding winning
ticket could be stretched (or squeezed) into a subnetwork for another deeper
(or shallower) network from the same family, whose performance is nearly the
same competitive as the latter's winning ticket directly found by IMP. We have
also extensively compared E-LTH with pruning-at-initialization and dynamic
sparse training methods, as well as discussed the generalizability of E-LTH to
different model families, layer types, and across datasets. Code is available

our approach is capable of modeling complex appearance distributions in the

which serves as another powerful cue for the final segmentation, obtained by a
CNN decoder. We further exploit the end-to-end learning capabilities of our
approach to learn the output space of the GP learner, ensuring a richer

the true target dynamics can cause trained policies to fail to generalize and
adapt appropriately when deployed in the real-world. The MRAC-RL framework
generates online policies by utilizing an inner-loop adaptive controller
together with a simulation-trained outer-loop RL policy. This structure allows
MRAC-RL to adapt and operate effectively in a target environment, even when
parametric uncertainties exists. We propose a set of novel MRAC algorithms,
apply them to a class of nonlinear systems, derive the associated control laws,
provide stability guarantees for the resulting closed-loop system, and show

Our study starts from a model-independent effective field-theory approach and
then considers both a simplified model and a UV-complete extension of the
Standard Model featuring a vector leptoquark $U_1$ as the main mediator of the
anomalies. We show that the new LHCb data corroborate the emerging pattern of a
new, predominantly left-handed, semileptonic current-current interaction with a
flavor structure respecting a (minimally) broken $U(2)^5$ flavor symmetry. New
aspects of our analysis include a combined analysis of the semileptonic
operators involving tau leptons, including in particular the important
constraint from $B_s$--$\bar B_s$ mixing, a systematic study of the effects of
right-handed leptoquark couplings and of deviations from minimal
flavor-symmetry breaking, a detailed analysis of various rare $B$-decay modes
which would provide smoking-gun signatures of this non-standard framework (LFV
decays, di-tau modes, and $B\to K^{(*)}\nu\bar\nu$), and finally an updated
analysis of collider bounds on the leptoquark mass and couplings.

Multiple setups have been proposed, and researchers apply new model

there still exist non-negligible gaps between machines' performance and human

conduct a series of diagnostic experiments to unveil agents' focus during

heavily rely on direction tokens and poorly understand the object tokens.
Transformer-based agents acquire a better cross-modal understanding of objects

further incorporates a semantic parser to parse questions into semantic

quantum spin liquids in the $S=1/2$ hyper-hyperkagome magnet using the complex

symmetry group analysis, we identify only two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids and a
$U(1)$ spin liquid that are compatible with the hyper-hyperkagome structure.
The $U(1)$ spin liquid has a spinon Fermi surface. For the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin
liquids, one has a small excitation gap, while the other is gapless and
proximate to the $U(1)$ spin liquid. We show that the gapped and gapless spin

$\sim1000\times$ in the $\sim500$ Myr between $z\sim10$ and $z\sim6$, with
indications of a steeper evolution between $z\sim10$ and $z\sim8$, similar to
the previously-reported trend of the star-formation rate density. Strikingly,
abundance matching to the Bolshoi-Planck simulation indicates halo mass
densities evolving at approximately the same rate as the SMD between $z\sim10$

photometric, structural, and dynamical properties. In this work, we address
their structural complexity by studying with deep imaging a sample of nine
dwarf ETGs from the Virgo galaxy cluster, characterized by having faint disk
features, such as bars and spiral arms, which lie mostly hidden within the
bright diffuse light of the galaxies. We present a new, robust method that aims
to identify and extract the disk substructure embedded in these dwarf ETGs. The
method consists in an iterative procedure that gradually separates a galaxy
image into two components; the bright, dominant diffuse component, and the much
fainter, underlying disk component. By applying it to the dwarf ETG sample, we
quantify their disk substructure and find that its relative contribution to the
total galaxy light ranges between 2.2 to 6.4% within two effective radii. We
test the reliability of the method, and prove that it is accurate in recovering
the disk substructure we introduce in mock galaxy images, even at low
disk-to-total light fractions of a few percent. As a potential application of
the method, we perform a Fourier analysis on the extracted disk substructures
and measure the orientation, length, and strength of the bars, and the pitch
angle and strength of the spiral arms. We also briefly discuss a scenario based
on the numerical simulations presented in our companion paper, Brought to Light

in such dwarf systems.

gravity theories and black hole physics and to serve as probes of the stellar
formation history and evolution and the interstellar medium in the complex
central region of the Milky Way. The community has surveyed the innermost
region of the galaxy for decades without detecting a population of pulsars,
which is puzzling. A strong scattering of the pulsed signals in this particular
direction has been argued to be a potential reason for the non-detections.
Scattering has a strong inverse dependence on observing frequency, therefore an
effective way to alleviate its effect is to use higher frequencies in a survey
for pulsars in the Galactic centre, in particular, close to the supermassive
black hole Sagittarius A*. We present the first pulsar survey at short
millimetre wavelengths, using several frequency bands between 84 and 156 GHz
(3.57-1.92 mm), targeted to the Galactic centre. The observations were made
with the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique (IRAM) 30m Telescope in 28
epochs between 2016 December and 2018 May. This survey is the first that is
essentially unaffected by scattering and therefore unbiased in population
coverage, including fast-spinning pulsars that might be out of reach of
lower-frequency Galactic centre surveys. We discovered no new pulsars and
relate this result mainly to the decreased flux density of pulsars at high
frequencies, combined with our current sensitivity. However, we demonstrate
that surveys at these extremely high radio frequencies are capable of
discovering new pulsars, analyse their sensitivity limits with respect to a
simulated Galactic centre pulsar population, and discuss the main challenges
and possible improvements for similar surveys in the future.

triggering generates features in our model disks that bear a striking
resemblance to the observed features. However, we find the disks must be highly
rotationally supported (V$_{\rm{peak}}/\sigma_0 \sim 3$), much higher than
typically observed. We propose that some early-type dwarfs may contain a few
percent of their mass in a cold, thin disk which is buried in the light of a
hot, diffuse disk, and only revealed when they undergo tidal triggering. The
red optical colors of our sample do not indicate any recent significant star
formation, and our simulations show that very plunging pericenter passages
(r$_{\rm{peri}}<0.25$r$_{\rm{vir}}$) are required for tidal triggering. Thus,
many cluster early-type dwarfs with less plunging orbits may host a yet
undetected cold stellar disk component. We discuss possible origin scenarios

significantly more thin disk dominated than in our cluster sample.

eventually form. Neutrinos also modify the composition of the ejected material,
impacting the outcome of nucleosynthesis in merger outflows and the properties
of the optical/infrared transients that they power (kilonovae). So far, merger
simulations have largely relied on approximate treatments of the neutrinos

large, offline datasets for both evaluating and selecting complex policies for
decision making. The ability to learn offline is particularly important in many
real-world domains, such as in healthcare, recommender systems, or robotics,
where online data collection is an expensive and potentially dangerous process.
Being able to accurately evaluate and select high-performing policies without
requiring online interaction could yield significant benefits in safety, time,
and cost for these applications. While many OPE methods have been proposed in
recent years, comparing results between papers is difficult because currently
there is a lack of a comprehensive and unified benchmark, and measuring
algorithmic progress has been challenging due to the lack of difficult
evaluation tasks. In order to address this gap, we present a collection of
policies that in conjunction with existing offline datasets can be used for
benchmarking off-policy evaluation. Our tasks include a range of challenging
high-dimensional continuous control problems, with wide selections of datasets
and policies for performing policy selection. The goal of our benchmark is to
provide a standardized measure of progress that is motivated from a set of
principles designed to challenge and test the limits of existing OPE methods.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves with a wide range of frequencies in the threads
of solar prominences. It is believed that the waves are driven at the
photosphere and propagate along the magnetic field lines up to prominences
suspended in the corona. The dissipation of MHD wave energy in the partially
ionized prominence plasma is a heating mechanism whose relevance needs to be
explored. Here we consider a simple 1D model for a non-uniform thin thread and
investigate the heating associated with dissipation of Alfven waves. The model
assumes an ad hoc density profile and a uniform pressure, while the temperature
and ionization degree are self-consistently computed considering either LTE or
non-LTE approximations for the hydrogen ionization. A broadband driver for
Alfven waves is placed at one end of the magnetic field line, representing
photospheric excitation. The Alfvenic perturbations along the thread are
obtained by solving the linearized MHD equations for a partially ionized plasma
in the single-fluid approximation.We find that wave heating in the partially
ionized part of the thread is significant enough to compensate for energy
losses due to radiative cooling. A greater amount of heating is found in the
LTE case because the ionization degree for core prominence temperatures is
lower than that in the non-LTE approximation. This results in a greater level
of dissipation due to ambipolar diffusion in the LTE case. Conversely, in the
hot coronal part of the model, the plasma is fully ionized and wave heating is
negligible. The results of this simple model suggest that MHD wave heating can
be relevant for the energy balance in prominences. Further studies based on
more elaborate models are required.

$0.75^{+0.65}_{-0.45}$ proper Mpc (68% confidence) at $z = 5.1$ and 6.0,

measurements, suggesting that bias from the proximity effect is minor at this
redshift. At $z = 6.0$, however, we find that neglecting the proximity effect
biases the result high by a factor of two or more. Our measurement at $z = 6.0$
falls well below extrapolations from lower redshifts, indicating rapid
evolution in $\lambda_{\rm mfp}$ over $5 < z < 6$. This evolution disfavors
models in which reionization ended early enough that the IGM had time to fully
relax hydrodynamically by $z = 6$, but is qualitatively consistent with models
wherein reionization completed at $z = 6$ or even significantly later. Our mean
free path results are most consistent with late reionization models wherein the

protection of targeted nodes. Both players trade their
$\mathcal{H}_2$-performance objectives for the costs of their actions. The
standard backward induction method is modified to determine a cost-based

is demonstrated that reliable and robust defense is feasible unless the

continue further once it reaches more than four language editions. We also find
that the size of language editions is associated with the speed of propagation.

database management system (DBMS) that has a wide range of applications for
managing an enormous collection of multisource, heterogeneous, complex, or

a practical and impeccable DBMS can interact with users through information
selection, that is, querying with their targets. Previous querying algorithms,
such as frequent itemset querying and sequential pattern querying (SPQ) have
focused on the measurement of frequency, which does not involve the concept of
utility, which is helpful for users to discover more informative patterns. To
apply the querying technology for wider applications, we incorporate utility
into target-oriented SPQ and formulate the task of targeted utility-oriented
sequence querying. To address the proposed problem, we develop a novel
algorithm, namely targeted high-utility sequence querying (TUSQ), based on two
novel upper bounds suffix remain utility and terminated descendants utility as
well as a vertical Last Instance Table structure. For further efficiency, TUSQ
relies on a projection technology utilizing a compact data structure called the
targeted chain. An extensive experimental study conducted on several real and

Gadolinium), a process no longer thought to be safe. Although a number of

adversarial knowledge distillation (KD) technique, whereby a pre-trained
teacher segmentation network, with access to all MRI sequences, teaches a
student network, via hierarchical adversarial training, to better overcome the
large domain shift presented when crucial images are absent during inference.
In particular, we apply HAD-Net to the challenging task of enhancing tumour
segmentation when access to post-contrast imaging is not available. The
proposed network is trained and tested on the BraTS 2019 brain tumour
segmentation challenge dataset, where it achieves performance improvements in
the ranges of 16% - 26% over (a) recent modality-agnostic segmentation methods

improvements in tumour core (TC) Dice scores. Finally, the network outperforms

computing the transport strategy in a centralized fashion requires significant

algorithm that can be applied to large scale problems. To this end, we develop
a fully distributed algorithm for fair and dynamic optimal transport with
provable convergence using alternating method of multipliers. In the designed
algorithm, each corresponding pair of resource supplier and receiver compute
their own solutions and update the transport schemes through negotiation
iteratively which do not require a central planner. The distributed algorithm
can yield a fair and efficient resource allocation mechanism over a network. We
corroborate the obtained results through case studies.

conditions and how deformed relativistic kinematics, encoded in a momentum
space metric on flat spacetime, can be lifted to curved spacetimes in terms of
a self-consistent cotangent bundle geometry, which leads to purely geometric,
geodesic motion of freely falling point particles. We comment how this
construction is connected to, and offers a new perspective on, non-commutative
spacetimes. From geometric consistency conditions we find that momentum space
metrics can be consistently lifted to curved spacetimes if they either lead to
a dispersion relation which is homogeneous in the momenta, or, if they satisfy
a specific symmetry constraint. The latter is relevant for the momentum space
metrics encoding the most studied deformed relativistic kinematics. For these,
the constraint can only be satisfied in a momentum space basis in which the
momentum space metric is invariant under linear local Lorentz transformations.

learn feedback policies with certified closed-loop robustness, wherein the
Lipschitz constraint serves as a mechanism to tune the generalization
performance and robustness to adversarial disturbances. Our analysis exploits
the Lipschitz property to obtain closed-loop guarantees on generalization and
robustness of the learned policies. In particular, we derive a finite sample
bound on the policy learning error and establish robust closed-loop stability
under the learned control policy. We also derive bounds on the closed-loop
regret with respect to the expert policy and the deterioration of closed-loop
performance under bounded (adversarial) disturbances to the state measurements.
Numerical results validate our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of
our robust feedback policy learning framework. Finally, our results suggest the
existence of a potential tradeoff between nominal closed-loop performance and
adversarial robustness, and that improvements in nominal closed-loop
performance can only be made at the expense of robustness to adversarial
perturbations.

standing one. Generally one finds that a first order phase transition from
baryons to quarks softens the equation of state so much that the star would
collapse into a black hole. We consider a crossover equation of state, similar
to the crossover that is found in lattice QCD studies at finite temperature and
zero or small baryon chemical potentials. We find that with reasonable
parameters it may be possible to support neutron stars up to about 2.2 solar
masses. In that case 1 to 10% of the pressure would be contributed by quark
matter in the central core of the highest mass stars.

their hemispheres, likely caused by differing reflectivity off their surfaces.
Additional sub-types show no rotational variability suggesting a uniform

is a promising step towards the categorization of floofy objects, further
observations with more strictly defined limits on background light,

Efficient n-type doping of Ga2O3 has been achieved, but p-type doping faces
fundamental obstacles due to compensation, deep acceptor levels, and the
polaron transport mechanism of free holes. However, aside from achieving p-type
conductivity, plenty of opportunity exists to engineer the position of the
Fermi level for improved design of Ga2O3 based devices. We use first-principles
defect theory and defect equilibrium calculations to simulate a 3-step
growth-annealing-quench synthesis protocol for hydrogen assisted Mg doping in
beta-Ga2O3, taking into account the gas phase equilibrium between H2, O2 and
H2O, which determines the H chemical potential. We predict Ga2O3 doping-type
conversion to a net p-type regime after growth under reducing conditions in the
presence of H2 followed by O-rich annealing, which is a similar process to the
Mg acceptor activation by H removal in GaN. For equilibrium annealing there is
an optimal temperature that maximizes the Ga2O3 net acceptor density for a
given Mg doping level, which is further increased in the non-equilibrium
annealing scenario without re-equilibration. After quenching to operating
temperature, the Ga2O3 Fermi level drops below mid-gap down to about +1.5 eV
above the valence band maximum, creating a significant number of uncompensated
neutral MgGa0 acceptors. The Fermi level reduction down to +1.5 eV and
suppression of free electron density in this doping type converted (NA > ND)
Ga2O3 material is of significance and impact for the design of Ga2O3 power

the facets of the convex hull of these points. The algorithm relies on an
oracle which solves single-objective weighted-sum problems and we show that the
required number of oracle calls is polynomial in the number of facets of the
convex hull of the non-dominated extreme points in the case of multiobjective
mixed-integer programming (MOMILP). Thus, for MOMILP problems for which the
weighted-sum problem is solvable in polynomial time, the facets can be computed
with incremental-polynomial delay. From a practical perspective, the algorithm
starts from a valid lower bound set for the non-dominated extreme points and
iteratively improves it. Therefore it can be used in multi-objective
branch-and-bound algorithms and still provide a valid bound set at any stage,

optimal solutions, which makes the algorithm also attractive from the primal
side in a multi-objective branch-and-bound context. Finally, the oracle can
also be called with any relaxation of the primal problem, and the obtained

efficient for optimizing numerically costly functions. However, BO is not often
compared to widely different alternatives, and is mostly tested on narrow sets
of problems (multimodal, low-dimensional functions), which makes it difficult
to assess where (or if) they actually achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Moreover, several aspects in the design of these algorithms vary across
implementations without a clear recommendation emerging from current practices,
and many of these design choices are not substantiated by authoritative test
campaigns. This article reports a large investigation about the effects on the
performance of (Gaussian process based) BO of common and less common design
choices. The experiments are carried out with the established COCO (COmparing
Continuous Optimizers) software. It is found that a small initial budget, a
quadratic trend, high-quality optimization of the acquisition criterion bring
consistent progress. Using the GP mean as an occasional acquisition contributes
to a negligible additional improvement. Warping degrades performance. The
Mat\'ern 5/2 kernel is a good default but it may be surpassed by the
exponential kernel on irregular functions. Overall, the best EGO variants are
competitive or improve over state-of-the-art algorithms in dimensions less or
equal to 5 for multimodal functions. The code developed for this study makes
the new version (v2.1.1) of the R package DiceOptim available on CRAN. The
structure of the experiments by function groups allows to define priorities for
future research on Bayesian optimization.

requires a scalable verifier tailored to point cloud models that handles a wide

and introduce 3DCertify, the first verifier able to certify the robustness of
point cloud models. 3DCertify is based on two key insights: (i) a generic
relaxation based on first-order Taylor approximations, applicable to any
differentiable transformation, and (ii) a precise relaxation for global feature
pooling, which is more complex than pointwise activations (e.g., ReLU or
sigmoid) but commonly employed in point cloud models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of 3DCertify by performing an extensive evaluation on a wide
range of 3D transformations (e.g., rotation, twisting) for both classification

rotations by $\pm$60{\deg} for 95.7% of point clouds, and our max pool
relaxation increases certification by up to 15.6%.

resolutions in or-der to appropriately depict the increasing share of
intermittent renewable energy sources, storage technologies, and the growing
interconnectivity across energy sectors. This study evaluates methods for
maintaining the computational viability of these models by ana-lyzing different
temporal aggregation techniques that reduce the number of time steps in their
in-put time series. Two commonly-employed approaches are the representation of
time series by a subset of single (typical) time steps, or by groups of
consecutive time steps (typical periods). We test these techniques for two
different energy system models that are implemented using the Frame-work for
Integrated Energy System Assessment (FINE) by benchmarking the optimization
results based on aggregation to those of the fully resolved models and
investigating whether the optimal aggregation method can, a priori, be
determined based on the clustering indicators. The results reveal that typical
time steps consistenly outperform typical days with respect to cluster-ing
indicators, but do not lead to more accurate optimization results when applied
to a model that takes numerous storage technologies into account. Although both
aggregation techniques are ca-pable of coupling the aggregated time steps,
typical days offer more options to depict storage oper-ations, whereas typical
time steps are more effective for models that neglect time-linking
con-straints. In summary, the adequate choice of aggregation methods strongly
depends on the mathematical structure of the considered energy system
optimization model, and a priori decisions of a sufficient temporal aggregation
are only possible with good knowledge of this mathematical structure.

compute steps from linear systems involving a shifted Hessian in the spirit of
the Levenberg-Marquardt and trust-region methods. The standard approach
consists in performing an iterative search for the shift akin to solving the
secular equation in trust-region methods. Such search requires computing the
Cholesky factorization of a tentative shifted Hessian at each iteration, which
limits the size of problems that can be reasonably considered. We propose a
scalable implementation of ARC named ARCqK in which we solve a set of shifted
systems concurrently by way of an appropriate modification of the Lanczos
formulation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method. At each iteration of ARCqK
to solve a problem with n variables, a range of m << n shift parameters is
selected. The computational overhead in CG beyond the Lanczos process is
thirteen scalar operations to update five vectors of length m and two n-vector
updates for each value of the shift. The CG variant only requires one
Hessian-vector product and one dot product per iteration, independently of the
number of shift parameters. Solves corresponding to inadequate shift parameters
are interrupted early. All shifted systems are solved inexactly. Such modest
cost makes our implementation scalable and appropriate for large-scale
problems. We provide a new analysis of the inexact ARC method including its
worst case evaluation complexity, global and asymptotic convergence. We
describe our implementation and provide preliminary numerical observations that
confirm that for problems of size at least 100, our implementation of ARCqK is

through the dielectric occurs during controlled breakdown has not yet been

rotations are antiparallel. Similar reverse dynamics include the rotations of
Venus and Uranus, journal machinery bearings, tissue production reactors, and
chiral active particles. Due to dissipation, RRs are possible only as a
transient. Here the transient or flip time $t_\textrm{f}$ depends on the

microscopy images is important for drug discovery. Drug development efforts
typically analyse thousands of cell images to screen for potential treatments.
Early works focus on creating hand-engineered features from these images or
learn such features with deep neural networks in a fully or weakly-supervised
framework. Both require prior knowledge or labelled datasets. Therefore,
subsequent works propose unsupervised approaches based on generative models to
learn these representations. Recently, representations learned with
self-supervised contrastive loss-based methods have yielded state-of-the-art
results on various imaging tasks compared to earlier unsupervised approaches.
In this work, we leverage a contrastive learning framework to learn appropriate
representations from single-cell fluorescent microscopy images for the task of
Mechanism-of-Action classification. The proposed work is evaluated on the
annotated BBBC021 dataset, and we obtain state-of-the-art results in NSC, NCSB

in NCSB accuracy and 11% in NSC-NSCB drop over the previously best unsupervised
method. Moreover, the performance of our unsupervised approach ties with the
best supervised approach. Additionally, we observe that our framework performs
well even without post-processing, unlike earlier methods. With this, we
conclude that one can learn robust cell representations with contrastive

needed local cues, decoupled from the high-level semantics and naturally shared
over multiple classes. On the other hand, contrastive learning maximizes the
agreement between variants of the same shape with different missing portions,
thus producing a representation which captures the global appearance of the
shape. The combined embedding inherits category-agnostic properties from the
chosen pretext tasks. Differently from existing approaches, this allows to
better generalize the completion properties to new categories unseen at
training time. Moreover, while decoding the obtained joint representation, we
better blend the reconstructed missing part with the partial shape by paying
attention to its known surrounding region and reconstructing this frame as
auxiliary objective. Our extensive experiments and detailed ablation on the

boundary complexion transitions. However, understanding of the complexity of
such phenomena in polycrystalline materials is limited, as most studies focus
on bicrystal geometries. In this work, we investigate interfacial segregation
and subsequent complexion transitions in polycrystalline Cu-Zr alloys using
hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations. No significant change in the
grain size or structure is observed upon Zr dopant addition to a pure Cu
polycrystal at moderate temperature, where grain boundary segregation is the
dominant behavior. Segregation within the boundary network is inhomogeneous,
with some boundaries having local concentrations that are an order of magnitude
larger than the global value and others having almost no segregation, and
changes to physical parameters such as boundary free volume and energy are
found to correlate with dopant concentration. Further, another alloy sample is
investigated at a higher temperature to probe the occurrence of widespread
transitions in interfacial structure, where a significant fraction of the
originally ordered boundaries transition to amorphous complexions,
demonstrating the coexistence of multiple complexion types, each with their own
distribution of boundary chemical composition. Overall, this work highlights
that interfacial segregation and complexion structure can be diverse in a
polycrystalline network. The findings shown here complement existing
computational and experimental studies of individual interfaces and help pave
the way for unraveling the complexity of interfacial structure in realistic

  The visibility of deposits can fundamentally change the strategic structure

are costly to make. Thus, deposits can be used as a costly signal for a high
valuation. This is the source of multiple inefficiencies: To engage in costly
signalling, a bidder who bids first and has a high valuation will generally
over-deposit in equilibrium, i.e.~deposit more than he will bid. If high
valuations are likely there can, moreover, be entry deterrence through high
deposits: a bidder who bids first can deter subsequent bidders from entering
the auction. Pooling can happen in equilibrium, where bidders of different
valuations deposit the same amount. The auction fails to allocate the item to

Formally, we define and study problem of bunkers location, routing and spectrum

we address two criteria - network resilience (measured by the average lost flow
per potential attack) and spectrum usage. For that problem we propose integer

In the case study we analyze benefits and costs of the proposed protection
scheme. Moreover, we also analyze vulnerabilities of three realistic network
topologies to EMP attacks and identify their critical nodes. The investigation
proves high efficiency of the proposed approaches and shows that they allow to
save up to 90% of traffic lost in the case of no protection against these types

an acceptable statistical power (although lower using cross-validation). A
large separation between training and test accuracies using CV was observed,
especially in one-condition designs. This implies a low generalization ability

enhancement to the solar radiative output, certain spectral lines and continua
will, in theory, exhibit flare-induced dimmings. Observations of transitions of
orthohelium He I $\lambda\lambda 10830${\AA} and the He I D3 lines have shown
evidence of such dimming, usually followed by enhanced emission. It has been
suggested that non-thermal collisional ionisation of helium by an electron
beam, followed by recombinations to orthohelium, is responsible for
overpopulating the those levels, leading to stronger absorption. However it has
not been possible observationally to preclude the possibility of overpopulating
orthohelium via enhanced photoionisation of He I by EUV irradiance from the
flaring corona followed by recombinations. Here we present radiation
hydrodynamics simulations of non-thermal electron beam-driven flares where (1)
both non-thermal collisional ionisation of Helium and coronal irradiance are
included, and (2) only coronal irradiance is included. A grid of simulations
covering a range of total energies deposited by the electron beam, and a range
of non-thermal electron beam low-energy cutoff values, were simulated. In order
to obtain flare-induced dimming of the He I 10830{\AA} line it was necessary
for non-thermal collisional ionisations to be present. The effect was more
prominent in flares with larger low-energy cutoff values and longer lived in
weaker flares and flares with a more gradual energy deposition timescale. These
results demonstrate the usefulness of orthohelium line emission as a diagnostic

systematically missing covariates, this work presents a data-driven
spatio-temporal regression based clustering of threshold excesses. It is shown
that in a presence of systematically missing covariates the behavior of
threshold excesses becomes nonstationary and nonhomogenous. The presented
approach describes this complex behavior by a set of local stationary
Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) models, where the parameters are
expressed as regression models, and a latent spatio-temporal switching process.
The spatio-temporal switching process is resolved by the nonparametric Finite
Element Methodology for time series analysis with Bounded Variation of the
model parameters (FEM-BV). The presented FEM-BV-GPD approach goes beyond strong
a priori assumptions made in standard latent class models like Mixture Models
and Hidden Markov Models. In addition, it provides a pragmatic description of
the underlying dependency structure. The performance of the framework is
demonstrated on historical precipitation data for Switzerland and compared with
the results obtained by the standard methods on the same data.

tasks at unprecedented scale. Here, the central problems faced by a system
operator are to decide (i) how to divide available resources amongst the agents
assigned to tasks and (ii) how to coordinate the behavior of the agents to
optimize the efficiency of the resulting collective behavior. The focus of this
paper is on problem (i), where we seek to characterize the impact of the
division of resources on the best-case efficiency of the resulting collective
behavior. Specifically, we focus on a team Colonel Blotto game where there are
two sub-colonels competing against a common adversary in a two battlefield
environment. Here, each sub-colonel is assigned a given resource budget and is
required to allocate these resources independent of the other sub-colonel.
However, their success is dependent on the allocation strategy of both
sub-colonels. The central focus of this manuscript is on how to divide a common
pool of resources among the two sub-colonels to optimize the resulting
best-case efficiency guarantees. Intuitively, one would imagine that the more
balanced the division of resources, the worse the performance, as such
divisions restrict the sub-colonels' ability to employ joint randomized
strategies that tend to be necessary for optimizing performance guarantees.
However, the main result of this paper demonstrates that this intuition is
actually incorrect. A more balanced division of resources can offer better
performance guarantees than a more centralized division. Hence, this paper
demonstrates that the resource division problem is highly non-trivial in such
enmeshed environments and worthy of significant future research efforts.

availability of large and varied datasets, the benefit to causal inference has
been limited given the strong assumptions needed to ensure identifiability of
causal effects; these are often not satisfied in real-world datasets. For
example, many large observational datasets (e.g., case-control studies in
epidemiology, click-through data in recommender systems) suffer from selection
bias on the outcome, which makes the average treatment effect (ATE)
unidentifiable. We propose a general algorithm to estimate causal effects from
\emph{multiple} data sources, where the ATE may be identifiable only in some
datasets but not others. The key idea is to construct control variates using
the datasets in which the ATE is not identifiable. We show theoretically that
this reduces the variance of the ATE estimate. We apply this framework to
inference from observational data under outcome selection bias, assuming access
to an auxiliary small dataset from which we can obtain a consistent estimate of
the ATE. We construct a control variate by taking the difference of the odds
ratio estimates from the two datasets. Across simulations and two case studies
with real data, we show that this control variate can significantly reduce the

around depth edges, where light paths from both an object and its background
are integrated over the aperture. This light mixes at a sensor pixel to produce
erroneous depth estimates, which can adversely affect downstream 3D vision
tasks. Mask-ToF starts at the source of these FPs, learning a microlens-level
occlusion mask which effectively creates a custom-shaped sub-aperture for each
sensor pixel. This modulates the selection of foreground and background light
mixtures on a per-pixel basis and thereby encodes scene geometric information
directly into the ToF measurements. We develop a differentiable ToF simulator
to jointly train a convolutional neural network to decode this information and
produce high-fidelity, low-FP depth reconstructions. We test the effectiveness
of Mask-ToF on a simulated light field dataset and validate the method with an
experimental prototype. To this end, we manufacture the learned amplitude mask
and design an optical relay system to virtually place it on a high-resolution
ToF sensor. We find that Mask-ToF generalizes well to real data without

random forests continue remain a go-to model of choice for applied
statisticians and data scientists. Despite their widespread use, however, until
recently, little was known about their inner-workings and about which aspects
of the procedure were driving their success. Very recently, two competing
hypotheses have emerged -- one based on interpolation and the other based on
regularization. This work argues in favor of the latter by utilizing the
regularization framework to reexamine the decades-old question of whether
individual trees in an ensemble ought to be pruned. Despite the fact that
default constructions of random forests use near full depth trees in most
popular software packages, here we provide strong evidence that tree depth
should be seen as a natural form of regularization across the entire procedure.
In particular, our work suggests that random forests with shallow trees are
advantageous when the signal-to-noise ratio in the data is low. In building up
this argument, we also critique the newly popular notion of ""double descent"" in
random forests by drawing parallels to U-statistics and arguing that the
noticeable jumps in random forest accuracy are the result of simple averaging

convoluted relationship has implications for early literacy software,

this issue is to use manipulables (blocks) that are directly tied to phonemes.
However, creating phoneme-based blocks leads to two design challenges: (a) how
to represent phonemes visually in a child-accessible way and (b) how to account
for context-dependent spelling. In the present work, we approached these
challenges by developing a set of animated, onomatopoeia-based mnemonic
characters, one per phoneme, that can take the shape of different graphemes.We
applied the characters to a construction-based literacy app to simplify
independent word-building for literacy beginners. We tested the app during a
13-week-long period with 4- to 5-year-olds in kindergarten classrooms. Children
showed visible interest in the characters and properly grasped the principles
of their functioning. However, the blocks were not sufficient to scaffold
independent word building, leading children to rely on other scaffolding
mechanisms. To test the characters' efficiency as mnemonics, we evaluated their
effect on the speed and accuracy of finding phonemes on a keyboard. The results
suggest that there were both children who benefitted from the characters in
this task and those who performed better without them. The factors that
differentiated these two categories are currently unclear. To help further
research on phonetic mnemonics in literacy learning software, we are making the
characters available to the research community.

electricity restoration is the use of locally available energy resources to
restore the system to form isolated microgrids. In this paper, we present a

The master DGs in the formed microgrids are coordinated to work together
through droop control. Several constraints, including incentive-based demand

operation constraints, were formulated and linearized to realize a
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) restoration model. To improve
compactness and to ensure that the model is neither under-sized nor over-sized,
a pre-processing graph analysis approach was introduced which helps to
characterize the least number of restoration steps needed to optimally restore
the microgrid. Studies were performed on a modified IEEE 123 node test feeder
to evaluate the effects of demand response, non-dispatchable DGs, and choice of

media with piece-wise and smooth inhomogeneities is studied with the goal to
clarify the question of renormalizability of diverging electromagnetic
stress-energy tensor. First, the stress tensor is computed with the Lifshitz
approach to London forces in the non-retarded limit, which after the
substraction of the leading free space ultraviolet divergencies still retains
the divergencies associated with the presence of sharp boundaries between
piece-wise inhomogeneities. We call these contributions finite because they
become renormalized after a sharp interface is replaced with a dielectric
permittivity changing according to a smooth function of spatial coordinates. In
addition, such a smoothed out interface exhibits new subleading ultraviolet
divergencies that appear due to its internal structure. To systematically deal
with the polarization of inhomogeneous media, the Hadamard expansion is applied
to single out both finite and subleading contributions and to unequivocally
demonstrate incomplete renormalizability of the Lifshitz theory.
  The above approach also allows us to reveal the nature of surface tension,
which proves to be purely quantum mechanical. The deduced theory of surface
tension and its calculations for real dielectric media are favorably compared
to the available experimental data. While the sharp interface limit recovers
the classical boundary conditions for the electric field and uncovers the
origin of the apparent local divergencies of the renormalized stresses in the
sharp interface formulation previously pointed out in the literature, the
problem of surface tension proves to be of a distinguished limit type because
the sharp interface formulation loses the information about the internal
structure of an interface and hence cannot explain the origin of surface
tension.

makes the distinction between red and asymptotic giants difficult. We perform a
thorough seismic analysis to address the physical conditions inside these stars

2.000 evolved giants in a model described by the asymptotic pressure-mode
pattern of red giants, which includes the signature of the helium
second-ionisation zone. We extracted the mode properties up to the degree l = 3
and investigated their dependence on stellar mass, metallicity, and
evolutionary status. We identify a clear difference in the signature of the
helium second-ionisation zone between red and asymptotic giants. We also detect
a clear shortage of the energy of l = 1 modes after the core-He-burning phase.
Furthermore, we note that the mode damping observed on the asymptotic giant
branch is similar to that observed on the red giant branch. We highlight that
the signature of the helium second-ionisation zone varies with stellar

branch stars from asymptotic giants. Here, our investigation of stellar

of the asymmetry, including radial width, aspect ratio, contrast, and
contribution to the total flux, were found to be similar to the asymmetries
around intermediate mass stars ($\sim$2~$M_{\sun}$) such as MWC~758 and IRS~48.
This implies that the asymmetry in the ZZ~Tau~IRS disk shares a similar origin

is coupled to a conserved mass density in order to accommodate non-solenoidal
flows near the smectic-isotropic boundary arising from density contrast between
the two phases. The model aims to describe morphological transitions in smectic
thin films under heat treatment, in which arrays of focal conic defects lead to
conical pyramids and concentric rings through curvature dependent evaporation
of smectic layers. The model leads to an extended thermodynamic relation at a
curved surface that includes its Gaussian curvature, non-classical stresses at
the boundary and flows arising from density gradients. The temporal evolution
given by the model conserves the overall mass of the liquid crystal while still
allowing for the modulated smectic structure to grow or shrink. A numerical
solution of the governing equations reveals that pyramidal domains are sculpted
at the center of focal conics upon a temperature increase, which display
tangential flows at their surface. Other cases investigated include the
possible coalescence of two cylindrical stacks of smectic layers, formation of

emotions over a timescale of $\tau\sim14$ yr. Previous progress on this topic
has been challenging based on the sheer volume of the relevant discography, and
that uniquely identifying a song that optimally describes a hypothetical
emotional state represents a multi-dimensional and complex task. To quantify
the emotional state of a song, we separate the criteria into the level of
optimism ($H$) and the strength of commitment to a relationship ($R$), based on
lyrics and chordal tones. We apply these criteria to a set of 149 pieces
spanning almost the entire repertoire. We find an overall trend toward positive
emotions in stronger relationships, with a best-fit linear relationship of
$R=0.642^{+0.086}_{-0.053}H-1.74^{+0.39}_{-0.29}$. We find no significant
trends in mean happiness ($H$) within individual albums over time. The mean
relationship score ($R$) shows trends which we speculate may be due to age and
the global pandemic. We provide tentative indications that partners with blue
eyes and/or bad reputations may lead to overall less positive emotions, while
those with green or indigo-colored eyes may produce more positive emotions and
stronger relationships. However, we stress that these trends are based on small
sample sizes, and more data are necessary to validate them. Finally, we present
the taylorswift python package which can be used to optimize song selection

leading either to the formation of an oxide film or to the dissolution of the
host material. Commonly, the first step in corrosion involves an oxygen atom
from the dissociated water that reacts with the surface atoms and breaks near
surface bonds. In contrast, hydrogen on the surface often functions as a
passivating species. Here, we discovered that the roles of O and H are reversed
in the early corrosion stages on a Si terminated SiC surface. O forms stable
species on the surface, and chemical attack occurs by H that breaks the Si-C
bonds. This so-called hydrogen scission reaction is enabled by a newly
discovered metastable bridging hydroxyl group that can form during water
dissociation. The Si atom that is displaced from the surface during water
attack subsequently forms H2SiO3, which is a known precursor to the formation
of silica and silicic acid. This study suggests that the roles of H and O in
oxidation need to be reconsidered.

multi-breather molecules, and molecular complexes originating from the binding

magnitude larger than that of their stationary soliton counterparts and is a
signature of long-range interactions. Numerical simulations of the laser model

to further push the boundaries in image generation. Specifically, we propose a
novel dual contrastive loss and show that, with this loss, discriminator learns
more generalized and distinguishable representations to incentivize generation.
In addition, we revisit attention and extensively experiment with different
attention blocks in the generator. We find attention to be still an important
module for successful image generation even though it was not used in the
recent state-of-the-art models. Lastly, we study different attention
architectures in the discriminator, and propose a reference attention

the underlying physical process, the intensity fluctuation correlation theory
is developed to describe the superbunching effect in the temporal and spatial
domain, which agrees with experimental results well. Such experimental results
are conducive to the study of superbunching effect which plays an important
role in improving the performance in related applications, such as the contrast
of ghost imaging.

are not required to possess a notion of range, many natural examples do. These
include commonly occurring constellations related to concrete categories (since
they model surjective morphisms), and also others arising from quite different
sources, including from well-studied classes of semigroups. We show how
constellations with a well-behaved range operation are nothing but ordered
categories with restrictions. We characterise abstractly those categories that
are canonical extensions of constellations with range, as so-called
IS-categories. Such categories contain distinguished subcategories of
insertions (which are monomorphisms) and surjections (in general different to
the epimorphisms) such that each morphism admits a unique factorisation into a
surjection followed by an insertion. Most familiar concrete categories are
IS-categories, and we show how some of the well-known properties of these
categories arise from the fact that they are IS-categories. For appropriate
choices of morphisms in each, the category of IS-categories is shown to be
equivalent to the category of constellations with range.

through limited bandwidth channels in a perceptually optimal way, it is
important to consider perceptual trade-offs of compression and space-time
downsampling protocols. In this direction, we have studied and developed new
models of natural video statistics (NVS), which are useful because high-quality
videos contain statistical regularities that are disturbed by distortions.
Specifically, we model the statistics of divisively normalized difference
between neighboring frames that are relatively displaced. In an extensive
empirical study, we found that those paths of space-time displaced frame
differences that provide maximal regularity against our NVS model generally
align best with motion trajectories. Motivated by this, we build a new video
quality prediction engine that extracts NVS features from displaced frame
differences, and combines them in a learned regressor that can accurately
predict perceptual quality. As a stringent test of the new model, we apply it
to the difficult problem of predicting the quality of videos subjected not only
to compression, but also to downsampling in space and/or time. We show that the
new quality model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction performance
compared on the new ETRI-LIVE Space-Time Subsampled Video Quality (STSVQ)
database, which is dedicated to this problem. Downsampling protocols are of
high interest to the streaming video industry, given rapid increases in frame
resolutions and frame rates.

quantum machine learning (QML) models implemented on noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) machines can achieve quantum advantages. Recently, Huang et al.
[Nat Commun 12, 2631] partially answered this question by the lens of quantum
kernel learning. Namely, they exhibited that quantum kernels can learn specific
datasets with lower generalization error over the optimal classical kernel
methods. However, most of their results are established on the ideal setting
and ignore the caveats of near-term quantum machines. To this end, a crucial
open question is: does the power of quantum kernels still hold under the NISQ
setting? In this study, we fill this knowledge gap by exploiting the power of
quantum kernels when the quantum system noise and sample error are considered.
Concretely, we first prove that the advantage of quantum kernels is vanished
for large size of datasets, few number of measurements, and large system noise.
With the aim of preserving the superiority of quantum kernels in the NISQ era,
we further devise an effective method via indefinite kernel learning. Numerical
simulations accord with our theoretical results. Our work provides theoretical
guidance of exploring advanced quantum kernels to attain quantum advantages on
NISQ devices.

public an automated methodology to facilitate the development of reviews in the
area. By critically analyzing 650 works, we describe the primary uses of
attention in convolutional, recurrent networks and generative models,
identifying common subgroups of uses and applications. Furthermore, we describe
the impact of attention in different application domains and their impact on

intense magnetic reconnection on the dayside magnetopause, which is represented
by the flux transfer event ""shower"", is reviewed on how they depend on
magnetosheath plasma beta and magnetic shear angle across the magnetopause,
following by how they contribute to the flux circulation and
magnetosphere-surface-exosphere coupling. In the next, the progress of
Mercury's magnetosphere under extreme solar events, including the core
induction and the reconnection erosion on the dayside magnetosphere, the
responses of the nightside magnetosphere, are reviewed. Then, the dawn-dusk
properties of the plasma sheet, including the features of the ions, the
structure of the current sheet, and the dynamics of magnetic reconnection, are
summarized. The last topic reviews the particle energization in Mercury's
magnetosphere, which includes the energization of the Kelvin-Helmholtz waves on
the magnetopause boundaries, reconnection-generated magnetic structures, and
the cross-tail electric field. In each chapter, the last section discusses the
open questions related with each topic, which can be considered by the

high-density fluid, have several promising applications. We show, via extensive
direct numerical simulations (DNSs), in both two and three dimensions (2D and
3D), that the spatiotemporal evolution of antibubbles can be described
naturally by the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations for a

breakup of an antibubble via the time evolution of the Cahn-Hilliard scalar
order parameter field $\phi$, which varies continuously across interfaces, so
we do not have to enforce complicated boundary conditions at the moving
antibubble interfaces. To ensure that our results are robust, we supplement our

Traditional methods detect and match interest points between a query image and

dense coordinates from RGB images. However, most of them require re-training or

scenes due to limited network capacity. We present a new method for scene
agnostic camera localization using dense scene matching (DSM), where a cost
volume is constructed between a query image and a scene. The cost volume and
the corresponding coordinates are processed by a CNN to predict dense
coordinates. Camera poses can then be solved by PnP algorithms. In addition,
our method can be extended to temporal domain, which leads to extra performance
boost during testing time. Our scene-agnostic approach achieves comparable
accuracy as the existing scene-specific approaches, such as KFNet, on the

quantum f-divergence of Petz is one generalization of the quantum relative

temperature-dependent unit cell volume could be described well using the Debye

consistent with the heat capacity data. The diverging trend of the NMR
spin-lattice relaxation rates ($^{31}1/T_1$ and $^{23}1/T_1$) imply the onset
of a magnetic long-range-ordering at very low temperatures supporting the

the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rates show the dominant contributions from
uniform ($q=0$) and staggered ($q = \pm \pi/a$) spin fluctuations in the high

spin-lattice. We have also demonstrated that $^{31}1/T_1$ in high temperatures
varies linearly with $1/\sqrt{H}$ reflecting the effect of spin diffusion on
the dynamic susceptibility. Further, the inter-chain frustration also
substantially impede the magnetic ordering rendering the spin-lattice a perfect

satisfied with a lower habitual level and is more reluctant to change the
habitual level after retirement, we assume that both the level and the
sensitivity of the habitual consumption decline at the time of retirement. We
establish the concise form of the habitual evolutions, and obtain the optimal
retirement time and consumption policy based on martingale and duality methods.
The optimal consumption experiences a sharp decline at retirement, but the
excess consumption raises because of the reduced sensitivity of the habitual
level. This result contributes to explain the ""retirement consumption puzzle"".
Particularly, the optimal retirement and consumption policies are balanced
between the wealth effect and the habitual effect. Larger wealth increases
consumption, and larger growth inertia (sensitivity) of the habitual level
decreases consumption and brings forward the retirement time.

phenomenology. Here we investigate a disordered XXZ spin chain in contact with
a bath which, alone, would drive the system towards a highly delocalized and
coherent Dicke state. We show that there exist regimes for which the natural
orbitals of the single-particle density matrix of the steady state are all
localized in the presence of strong disorders, either for weak interaction or
strong interaction. We show that the averaged steady-state occupation in the
eigenbasis of the open system Hamiltonian could follow an exponential decay for
intermediate disorder strength in the presence of weak interactions, while it
is more evenly spread for strong disorder or for stronger interactions. Last,
we show that strong dissipation increases the coherence of the steady states,
thus reducing the signatures of localization. We capture such signatures of
localization also with a concatenated inverse participation ratio which
simultaneously takes into account how localized are the eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian, and how close is the steady state to an incoherent mixture of
different energy eigenstates.

Our overall approach improves the quality of synthetic RIRs by compensating
low-frequency wave effects, similar to those in real RIRs. We evaluate the
performance of improved synthetic RIRs on a far-field speech dataset augmented
by convolving the LibriSpeech clean speech dataset [1] with RIRs and adding

real applications, the observation model involved are often complicated and
unknown, which leads to the serious performance drop of many advanced HIF

they generally require a large number of image pairs for model training, which
are difficult to obtain in realistic scenarios. Towards these issues, we
proposed a self-regression learning method that alternatively reconstructs
hyperspectral image (HSI) and estimate the observation model. In particular, we
adopt an invertible neural network (INN) for restoring the HSI, and two
fully-connected network (FCN) for estimating the observation model. Moreover,
\emph{SoftMax} nonlinearity is applied to the FCN for satisfying the
non-negative, sparsity and equality constraints. Besides, we proposed a local

euphemisms--ordinary-sounding words with a secret meaning--to conceal what they
are discussing. Nowadays, one common use of euphemisms is to evade content
moderation policies enforced by social media platforms. Existing tools for
enforcing policy automatically rely on keyword searches for words on a ""ban
list"", but these are notoriously imprecise: even when limited to swearwords,
they can still cause embarrassing false positives. When a commonly used
ordinary word acquires a euphemistic meaning, adding it to a keyword-based ban
list is hopeless: consider ""pot"" (storage container or marijuana?) or ""heater""
(household appliance or firearm?) The current generation of social media
companies instead hire staff to check posts manually, but this is expensive,
inhumane, and not much more effective. It is usually apparent to a human
moderator that a word is being used euphemistically, but they may not know what
the secret meaning is, and therefore whether the message violates policy. Also,
when a euphemism is banned, the group that used it need only invent another
one, leaving moderators one step behind.
  This paper will demonstrate unsupervised algorithms that, by analyzing words
in their sentence-level context, can both detect words being used
euphemistically, and identify the secret meaning of each word. Compared to the
existing state of the art, which uses context-free word embeddings, our
algorithm for detecting euphemisms achieves 30-400% higher detection accuracies
of unlabeled euphemisms in a text corpus. Our algorithm for revealing
euphemistic meanings of words is the first of its kind, as far as we are aware.
In the arms race between content moderators and policy evaders, our algorithms
may help shift the balance in the direction of the moderators.

by a constant and linear to the radius for the $s$-wave and $p$-wave wave
functions, respectively. We find, however, the deviation from such a simple
approximation is evident for heavy nuclei with large $Z$ by numerically solving
the Dirac equation. In our proposed formulas, the neutrino wave function is
treated exactly as a plane wave, while the electron wave function is obtained
by iteratively solving the integral equation, thus we can control the

decay phases of the flares in the 0.1-100 keV band ranged 1-11 $\times$
10$^{38}$ erg, which are at the upper end of the observed stellar flare. The
released energies during whole duration time ranged 2-13 $\times$ 10$^{38}$ erg
in the same band. We carried out X-ray follow-up observations for one of the 11
flares with Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) on 2017 July 18
and found that the flare cooled quasi-statically. On the basis of a
quasi-static cooling model, the flare loop length is derived to be 4 $\times$
10$^{12}$ cm (or 60 R$_{\odot}$). The electron density is derived to be 1
$\times$ 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, which is consistent with the typical value of
solar and stellar flares (10$^{10-13}$ cm$^{-3}$). The ratio of the cooling
timescales between radiative cooling ($\tau_{\rm rad}$) and conductive cooling
($\tau_{\rm cond}$) is estimated to be $\tau_{\rm rad}$ $\sim$ 0.1$\tau_{\rm
cond}$ from the temperature; thus radiative cooling was dominant in this flare.

However, the unexpectedly small size of the observed carrier pocket leaves open

the wavevector of any underlying order and the location of the carriers in

AGNs in dwarf galaxies might accelerate the evolution of galaxies by
accelerating the consumption of the gas, resulting in an overall quenching of
the dwarf galaxies, and the AGNs also become weak due to the lack of gas. The
median values of mass-weighted mean stellar age of both samples within 2 $Re$

the possible development of interfacial instabilities that can occur in porous

plume patterns that can develop during the CO$_2$ injection. The numerical
scheme utilises a boundary element method in which the normal velocity at the
interface of the two fluids is directly computed through the evaluation of a
hypersingular integral. The boundary integral equation is solved using a
Neumann convergent series with cubic B-Spline boundary discretisation,
exhibiting 6th order spatial convergence. The convergent series allows the long
term non-linear dynamics of growing viscous fingers to be explored accurately

differences in fingering patterns compared to those predicted by previous high
mobility ratio models. Most significantly, classical finger shielding between
competing fingers is inhibited. Secondary fingers can possess significant

methods for the wave equation in three spatial dimensions. The employed trial
spaces stem from simplex meshes of the lateral boundary of the space-time
cylinder. This approach conforms genuinely to the distinguished structure of
the solution operators of the wave equation, so-called retarded potentials.
Since the numerical evaluation of the arising integrals is intricate, the bulk
of this work is constituted by ideas about quadrature techniques for retarded
layer potentials and associated energetic bilinear forms. Finally, we glimpse
at algorithmic aspects regarding the efficient implementation of retarded
potentials in the space-time setting. The proposed methods are verified by
means of numerical experiments, which illustrate their capacity.

Bose-Fermi mixture, with a tunable Bose-Fermi pairing interaction $-U_{\rm

repulsive Bose-Bose interaction $U_{\rm BB}\ge 0$. Including strong
hetero-pairing fluctuations associated with the former interaction within the
self-consistent $T$-matrix approximation, as well as the latter within the
mean-field level, we calculate the compressibility matrix, to assess the
stability of this system against density fluctuations. In the weak- and the
intermediate-coupling regime with respect $-U_{\rm BF}$, we show that an
effective attractive interaction between bosons mediated by density
fluctuations in the Fermi component makes the system unstable below a certain
temperature $T_{\rm clp}$ (leading to density collapse). When $U_{\rm BB}=0$,
$T_{\rm clp}$ is always higher than the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)
temperature $T_{\rm c}$. When $U_{\rm BB}>0$, the density collapse is
suppressed, and the BEC transition becomes possible. It is also suppressed by
the formation of tightly bound Bose-Fermi molecules when the hetero-pairing
interaction $-U_{\rm BF}$ is strong; however, since the system may be viewed as
a molecular Fermi gas in this case, the BEC transition does not also occur.
Since quantum gases involving Bose atoms are known to be sensitive to
inter-particle correlations, our results would be useful for the study of
many-body properties of a Bose-Fermi mixture in a stable manner, without facing
the unwanted density collapse.

network is an effective way to promote the performance of the student. Despite
the different types, the guided knowledge used to distill is always kept
unchanged for different teacher and student pairs in previous knowledge
distillation methods. However, we find that teacher and student models with
different networks or trained from different initialization could have distinct
feature representations among different channels. (e.g. the high activated
channel for different categories). We name this incongruous representation of
channels as teacher-student knowledge discrepancy in the distillation process.
Ignoring the knowledge discrepancy problem of teacher and student models will
make the learning of student from teacher more difficult. To solve this
problem, in this paper, we propose a novel student-dependent distillation
method, knowledge consistent distillation, which makes teacher's knowledge more
consistent with the student and provides the best suitable knowledge to
different student networks for distillation. Extensive experiments on different
datasets (CIFAR100, ImageNet, COCO) and tasks (image classification, object
detection) reveal the widely existing knowledge discrepancy problem between
teachers and students and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
Our method is very flexible that can be easily combined with other
state-of-the-art approaches.

the question of patch validation is still open. Most of the present-day
approaches follow the so-called Generate-and-Validate approach, where first a
candidate solution is being generated and after validated against an oracle.
The latter, however, might not give a reliable result, because of the
imperfections in such oracles; one of which is usually the test suite. Although
(re-) running the test suite is right under one's nose, in real life
applications the problem of over- and underfitting often occurs, resulting in
inadequate patches. Efforts that have been made to tackle with this problem
include patch filtering, test suite expansion, careful patch producing and many
more. Most approaches to date use post-filtering relying either on test
execution traces or make use of some similarity concept measured on the
generated patches. Our goal is to investigate the nature of these
similarity-based approaches. To do so, we trained a Doc2Vec model on an
open-source JavaScript project and generated 465 patches for 10 bugs in it.
These plausible patches alongside with the developer fix are then ranked based
on their similarity to the original program. We analyzed these similarity lists
and found that plain document embeddings may lead to misclassification - it
fails to capture nuanced code semantics. Nevertheless, in some cases it also
provided useful information, thus helping to better understand the area of
Automated Program Repair.

sufficient surgical training and review, 50\% of these complications could be
prevented. To improve surgical performance, existing research uses various deep

recurrent neural networks (RNN) to automate surgical tool and workflow
detection. However, there is room to improve accuracy; real-time analysis is
also minimal due to the complexity of CNN. In this research, a novel DL
architecture is proposed to integrate visual simultaneous localization and
mapping (vSLAM) into Mask R-CNN. This architecture, vSLAM-CNN (vCNN), for the
first time, integrates the best of both worlds, inclusive of (1) vSLAM for
object detection, by focusing on geometric information for region proposals,
and (2) CNN for object recognition, by focusing on semantic information for
image classification, combining them into one joint end-to-end training
process. This method, using spatio-temporal information in addition to visual
features, is evaluated on M2CAI 2016 challenge datasets, achieving the
state-of-the-art results with 96.8 mAP for tool detection and 97.5 mean Jaccard
score for workflow detection, surpassing all previous works, and reaching a 50
FPS performance, 10x faster than the region-based CNN. A region proposal module

placing bounding boxes and lessening the annotation requirement. Furthermore, a
Microsoft HoloLens 2 application is developed to provide an augmented reality

included in the distribution of a target normal class or an anomaly class.
Conventional generative adversarial network (GAN)-based methods utilize an
entire image including foreground and background as an input. However, in these
methods, a useless region unrelated to the normal class (e.g., unrelated
background) is learned as normal class distribution, thereby leading to false
detection. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a novel two-stage
network consisting of an attention network and an anomaly detection GAN
(ADGAN). The attention network generates an attention map that can indicate the
region representing the normal class distribution. To generate an accurate
attention map, we propose the attention loss and the adversarial anomaly loss
based on synthetic anomaly samples generated from hard augmentation. By
applying the attention map to an image feature map, ADGAN learns the normal
class distribution from which the useless region is removed, and it is possible
to greatly reduce the problem difficulty of the anomaly detection task.
Additionally, the estimated attention map can be used for anomaly segmentation
because it can distinguish between normal and anomaly regions. As a result, the
proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection and anomaly
segmentation methods for widely used datasets.

approach to find a low-rank approximation for a given tensor. In the tensor
model, an $\ell_1$ regularized optimization problem was formulated with an
appropriate choice of the regularization parameter. The choice of the
regularization parameter is important in the approximation accuracy. However,
the emergence of the large amount of data poses onerous computational burden
for computing the regularization parameter via classical approaches such as the
weighted generalized cross validation (WGCV), the unbiased predictive risk
estimator, and the discrepancy principle. In order to improve the efficiency of
choosing the regularization parameter and leverage the accuracy of the CP
tensor, we propose a new algorithm for tensor completion by embedding the
flexible hybrid method into the framework of the CP tensor. The main benefits
of this method include incorporating regularization automatically and
efficiently, improved reconstruction and algorithmic robustness. Numerical
examples from image reconstruction and model order reduction demonstrate the

for lab-controlled FER. Real-world occlusions, variant head poses and other
issues definitely increase the difficulty of FER on account of these
information-deficient regions and complex backgrounds. Different from previous
pure CNNs based methods, we argue that it is feasible and practical to
translate facial images into sequences of visual words and perform expression
recognition from a global perspective. Therefore, we propose the Visual
Transformers with Feature Fusion (VTFF) to tackle FER in the wild by two main
steps. First, we propose the attentional selective fusion (ASF) for leveraging
two kinds of feature maps generated by two-branch CNNs. The ASF captures
discriminative information by fusing multiple features with the global-local
attention. The fused feature maps are then flattened and projected into
sequences of visual words. Second, inspired by the success of Transformers in
natural language processing, we propose to model relationships between these
visual words with the global self-attention. The proposed method is evaluated
on three public in-the-wild facial expression datasets (RAF-DB, FERPlus and

method shows superior performance over other methods, setting new state of the

augmentation techniques consist of masking blocks of frequency channels and
masking blocks of time frames, which improve generalization by enabling a model

the entire parts. Apart from using zeros for masking, we also examine two
approaches for masking based on the use of other samples within the minibatch,

vector mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{+\pm}$ in charmonium decays. In the quark model
scenario, the two axial vector nonets are connected with each other by the
Gell-Mann-Okubo mass relation through the mixing between two $K_1$ states (i.e.
$K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$) with configurations of $^3P_1$ and $^1P_1$. The
mixing angles between $f_1$ and $f_1'$ (i.e. $f_1(1285)$ and $f_1(1420)$), and
between $h_1$ and $h_1'$ (i.e. $h_1(1170)$ and $h_1(1415)$) can be reliably
constrained. We then introduce the intermediate $K^*\bar{K}+c.c.$ meson loop
transitions in the description of the productions and decays of these axial
vector mesons. The presence of the nearby $S$-wave $K^*\bar{K}+c.c.$ to which
these axial vector mesons have strong coupling strengths, turns out to be
crucial for understanding many puzzling questions related to their productions
and decays. This is because that the $S$-wave $K^*\bar{K}+c.c.$ rescatterings
by the kaon exchange satisfy the triangle singularity (TS) condition in some of
these cases and the TS mechanism can introduce special interference effects in
the exclusive decays of these light axial vector mesons.

variance of the data. The PC1 time series of aa cycles 10-23 has only one peak
in its power spectrum at the period 10.95 years, which is the average solar
cycle period for the interval SC10-SC23. The PC2 time series of the same cycles
has a clear peak at period 21.90 (Hale cycle) and a smaller peak at 3/4 of that

cycles 10-23, and compare mutual behavior of the PC2 components of aa-index and
SSN PCA analyses. We note that they are in the same phase in all other cycles
than Solar Cycles 15 and 20. The aa cycle 20 also differs from other even aa
cycles in its shape, especially in anomalously high peaks during its descending
phase. Even though there is a coherence in the PC2 time series phases of
aa-index and sunspot number, this effect is too small to cause all of the
difference of the shape of even and odd aa cycles. We estimate that 30% of the
shape of the PC2 component of aa-index is due to sunspot number and the rest to
other recurrent events in Sun/solar-wind. The first maximum of aa-data (typical
to odd cycles), during sunspot maximum, has been shown to be related to coronal
mass ejections (CME), while the second maximum (typical to even cycles) in the
declining phase of cycle, is probably related to high-speed streams (HSS). The
last events increase the activity level such that the minimum between even-odd
cycle-pair is always higher than the minimum between succeeding odd-even cycle
pair.

correlating the two measurement techniques, new insight into slip band

accumulation of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) is provided.
Multiple discrete slip bands are typically active within single grains,
resulting in significant slip band interactions. Crossing slip bands were found
to generate accumulations of GNDs. Regions where slip bands block other slip
bands were associated with the highest GND densities, in excess of three time
the densities of crossing slip bands. Representative crystal plasticity
modelling investigations have demonstrated that discrete slip blocking events
are responsible for locally elevated GND density. This behaviour is
rationalised in terms of lattice curvature associated with the differing levels
of constraint provided by the crossing or blocking-type behaviours. Ferrite
grains are also found to contribute to the generation of GNDs. Together, these
two effects provide significant work hardening mechanisms, likely to be key to
the development of future iron-base hard facing alloys.

Laplace-Beltrami operators associated with arbitrary Riemannian metrics. The
Cwikel-type estimates of our previous paper are extended to pseudodifferential

applications of these estimates. First, we get $L_p$-versions of the usual

\psidos\ with $L_p$-position operators. Next, we get $L_p$-versions of the

differences between these data. To address this problem, this paper proposes a
novel feature descriptor named the Histogram of Orientated Phase Congruency
(HOPC), which is based on the structural properties of images. Furthermore, a
similarity metric named HOPCncc is defined, which uses the normalized
correlation coefficient (NCC) of the HOPC descriptors for multimodal
registration. In the definition of the proposed similarity metric, we first
extend the phase congruency model to generate its orientation representation,
and use the extended model to build HOPCncc. Then a fast template matching
scheme for this metric is designed to detect the control points between images.
The proposed HOPCncc aims to capture the structural similarity between images,
and has been tested with a variety of optical, LiDAR, SAR and map data. The
results show that HOPCncc is robust against complex non-linear radiometric
differences and outperforms the state-of-the-art similarities metrics (i.e.,
NCC and mutual information) in matching performance. Moreover, a robust
registration method is also proposed in this paper based on HOPCncc, which is
evaluated using six pairs of multimodal remote sensing images. The experimental

degrees of freedom. Efficient and reliable estimation or maximization of RSMI
is, however, numerically challenging. A recent breakthrough in theoretical

following pipeline: (a) pretraining a neural network on a large-scale dataset
(e.g., ImageNet) and (b) finetuning the network weights on a smaller,
task-specific dataset. Such a pipeline assumes the sole weight adaptation is
able to transfer the network capability from one domain to another domain,
based on a strong assumption that a fixed architecture is appropriate for all
domains. However, each domain with a distinct recognition target may need
different levels/paths of feature hierarchy, where some neurons may become
redundant, and some others are re-activated to form new network structures. In
this work, we prove that dynamically adapting network architectures tailored
for each domain task along with weight finetuning benefits in both efficiency
and effectiveness, compared to the existing image recognition pipeline that
only tunes the weights regardless of the architecture. Our method can be easily
generalized to an unsupervised paradigm by replacing supernet training with
self-supervised learning in the source domain tasks and performing linear
evaluation in the downstream tasks. This further improves the search efficiency
of our method. Moreover, we also provide principled and empirical analysis to
explain why our approach works by investigating the ineffectiveness of existing
neural architecture search. We find that preserving the joint distribution of
the network architecture and weights is of importance. This analysis not only
benefits image recognition but also provides insights for crafting neural
networks. Experiments on five representative image recognition tasks such as
person re-identification, age estimation, gender recognition, image

their general-purposeness, i.e., the fact that they can be applied

specific prior knowledge. On the other hand, it has been shown that
incorporating a priori knowledge, such as expert knowledge or empirical
findings, can significantly improve the performance of an EA. However,
integrating knowledge in EAs poses numerous challenges. It is often the case
that the features of the search space are unknown, hence any knowledge
associated with the search space properties can be hardly used. In addition, a
priori knowledge is typically problem-specific and hard to generalize. In this
paper, we propose a framework, called Knowledge Integrated Evolutionary
Algorithm (KIEA), which facilitates the integration of existing knowledge into
EAs. Notably, the KIEA framework is EA-agnostic (i.e., it works with any
evolutionary algorithm), problem-independent (i.e., it is not dedicated to a
specific type of problems), expandable (i.e., its knowledge base can grow over
time). Furthermore, the framework integrates knowledge while the EA is running,
thus optimizing the use of the needed computational power. In the preliminary
experiments shown here, we observe that the KIEA framework produces in the
worst case an 80% improvement on the converge time, w.r.t. the corresponding

of the JUNO reactor neutrino experiment. Its purpose is to validate the
radiopurity of the scintillator to assure that all components of the JUNO
scintillator system work to specifications and only neutrino-grade scintillator
is filled into the JUNO Central Detector. The aspired sensitivity level of
$10^{-16}$ g/g of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th requires a large ($\sim$20 m$^3$)
detection volume and ultralow background levels. The present paper reports on
the design and major components of the OSIRIS detector, the detector simulation
as well as the measuring strategies foreseen and the sensitivity levels to U/Th
that can be reached in this setup.

$f$-divergences, and it considers some of their applications to coding
problems. This work also provides tight bounds on the R\'{e}nyi entropy of a
function of a discrete random variable with a finite number of possible values,
where the considered function is not one-to-one, and their derivation is based
on majorization and the Schur-concavity of the R\'{e}nyi entropy. One
application of the $f$-divergence inequalities refers to the performance
analysis of list decoding with either fixed or variable list sizes; some
earlier bounds on the list decoding error probability are reproduced in a
unified way, and new bounds are obtained and exemplified numerically. Another
application is related to a study of the quality of approximating a probability
mass function, which is induced by the leaves of a Tunstall tree, by an
equiprobable distribution. The compression rates of finite-length Tunstall
codes are further analyzed for asserting their closeness to the Shannon entropy
of a memoryless and stationary discrete source. In view of the tight bounds for
the R\'{e}nyi entropy and the work by Campbell, non-asymptotic bounds are
derived for lossless data compression of discrete memoryless sources.

quantum physics, in particular the topological phases. The valley Hall and
anomalous Hall effects are two representative topological phenomena. Here we
show that they can be unified in a strained honeycomb lattice, where the
hopping strengths between neighboring sites are designed by mimicking those
between the Fock states in a three-mode Jaynes-Cummings model. Such a strain
induces an effective magnetic field which results in quantized Landau levels.
The eigenstates in the zeroth Landau level can be represented by the
eigenstates of a large pseudo-spin. We find that the valley Hall current and
the chiral edge current in the Haldane model correspond to the spin precession
around different axes. Our study sheds light on connection between seemingly
unrelated topological phases in condensed matter physics.

pose a challenge for this issue. This paper proposes a novel approach to
characterize the features of OHLC data in a dataset and then performs dimension

principal component analysis. We refer to it as the pseudo-PCA method.
Specifically, we first propose a new way to represent the OHLC data, which will
free the inherent constraints and provide convenience for further analysis.
Moreover, there is a one-to-one match between the original OHLC data and its
feature-based representations, which means that the analysis of the
feature-based data can be reversed to the original OHLC data. Next, we develop
the pseudo-PCA procedure for OHLC data, which can effectively identify
important information and perform dimension reduction. Finally, the
effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed method are investigated

  Generative Adversarial Networks",,,"10.1109/LGRS.2021.3129285",,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Considering the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for
image-to-image translation, researchers have attempted to translate remote
sensing images (RSIs) to maps (rs2map) through GAN for cartography. However,
these studies involved limited scales, which hinders multi-scale map creation.
By extending their method, multi-scale RSIs can be trivially translated to
multi-scale maps (multi-scale rs2map translation) through scale-wise rs2map
models trained for certain scales (parallel strategy). However, this strategy
has two theoretical limitations. First, inconsistency between various spatial
resolutions of multi-scale RSIs and object generalization on multi-scale maps
(RS-m inconsistency) increasingly complicate the extraction of geographical
information from RSIs for rs2map models with decreasing scale. Second, as
rs2map translation is cross-domain, generators incur high computation costs to
transform the RSI pixel distribution to that on maps. Thus, we designed a
series strategy of generators for multi-scale rs2map translation to address
these limitations. In this strategy, high-resolution RSIs are inputted to an
rs2map model to output large-scale maps, which are translated to multi-scale
maps through series multi-scale map translation models. The series strategy
avoids RS-m inconsistency as inputs are high-resolution large-scale RSIs, and
reduces the distribution gap in multi-scale map generation through similar
pixel distributions among multi-scale maps. Our experimental results showed
better quality multi-scale map generation with the series strategy, as shown by
average increases of 11.69%, 53.78%, 55.42%, and 72.34% in the structural
similarity index, edge structural similarity index, intersection over union

cooperation with the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler

Machine Learning applications. We are convinced that our approach can serve as
the foundation for the certification of applications that use Machine Learning

aspects of secure software development, functional requirements, data quality,
data protection, and ethics. Inspired by existing work, we introduce four

Maxwell's demon) opens a challenging question if there exists a formulation of
the second law of thermodynamics based only on pure information ideas. Here,
such a formulation is suggested for unitary processes by introducing
information as a full-valuable physical quantity defining an (objective)
microscopic information entropy as 'information about microstate'. We show that
various forms of entropy (Boltzmann, Shannon, Clausius) are in fact only a
special cases of information entropy whose general form is found out. An
observer plays here the role of a special (information) reference frame (IRF)
towards which the entropy is defined. Some paradoxes or misunderstandings
connected with the concept of entropy or the content of the second law arise by
describing a situation without specifying a concrete IRF. Typically, the
Boltzmann statistical approach cannot be symmetrically used towards the past as
towards the future in one IRF. The information second law is full usable at
meso- or microscopic scales: the information form of the generalized second law
is found out too.

curvature makes the growth much more challenging compared with growths on
thin-films, particularly on NWs with small diameters ({\O} <100 nm). Moreover,
the {110} sidewall facets of self-catalyzed NWs favor two-dimensional growth
(2D), with the realization of three-dimensional (3D) Stranski-Krastanow growth
becoming extremely challenging. Here, we demonstrate thermally-driven formation
of Ge dots on the {110} sidewalls facets of thin self-catalyzed NWs without
using any surfactant or surface treatment. The 2D-3D transition of the
pseudomorphic Ge layer grown on GaAs NWs is driven by energy minimization under
high-temperature annealing. This method opens a new avenue to integrate QDs on
NWs without any restriction on NW diameter or elastic strain, which can allow
the formation of QDs in a wider range of materials systems where the growth of

have thermally activated electrical conductivity is crucial in order to achieve
high performance at low temperatures. In this work, we show directly that the
modulation of the potential barrier at the grain boundaries in perovskite
SrTiO3 changes the low-temperature dependency of the bulk material's electrical
conductivity. By sintering samples in a reducing environment of increasing
strength, we produced La0.08Sr0.9TiO3 (LSTO) ceramics that gradually change
their electrical conductivity behavior from thermally activated to
single-crystal-like, with only minor variations in the Seebeck coefficient.
Imaging of the surface potential by Kelvin probe force microscopy found lower
potential barriers at the grain boundaries in the LSTO samples that had been
processed in the more reducing environments. A theoretical model using the band
offset at the grain boundary to represent the potential barrier agreed well
with the measured grain boundary potential dependency of conductivity. The
present work showed an order of magnitude enhancement in electrical
conductivity (from 85 to 1287 S cm-1) and power factor (from 143 to 1745 {\mu}W
m-1 K-2) at 330 K by this modulation of charge transport at grain boundaries.
This significant reduction in the impact of grain boundaries on charge
transport in SrTiO3 provides an opportunity to achieve the ultimate 'phonon
glass electron crystal' by appropriate experimental design and processing.

several steps to exclude them from continuing routing operations. Thus, in the
DFA-RPL method, it first builds a cluster and selects the most appropriate node
as a cluster head in DODAG, then, due to the vulnerability of the RPL protocol
to Flooding attacks, it uses an ant colony algorithm (ACO) using five steps to
detect attacks. Use Flooding to prevent malicious activity on the IoT network.
In other words, if it detects a node as malicious, it puts that node on the

integrate high-quality III-V semiconductors onto Si platform, which is highly
promising to build lasers for Si photonics. However, the lasing from
vertically-standing NWs on silicon is much more difficult to achieve compared
with NWs broken off from substrates, causing significant challenges in the
integration. Here, the challenge of achieving vertically-standing NW lasers is
systematically analyzed. The poor optical reflectivity at the NW/Si interface
results severe optical field leakage to the substrate, and the commonly used
SiO2 or Si2N3 dielectric mask at the interface can only improve it to ~10%,
which is the major obstacle for achieving low-threshold lasing. A NW super
lattice distributed Bragg reflector is therefore proposed, which is able to
greatly improve the reflectivity to >97%. This study provides a highly-feasible
method to greatly improve the performance of vertically-standing NW lasers,
which can boost the rapid development of Si photonics.

electron-phonon interaction (EPI). Our results reveal that spin fluctuations
alone, when coupling only hole-like with electron-like energy bands, can
account for a critical temperature $T_c$ up to $\sim7.5\,\mathrm{K}$ with an
$s_{\pm}$-wave superconducting gap symmetry, which is a comparatively low $T_c$
with respect to the experimental value $T_c^{\mathrm{exp}}=30\,\mathrm{K}$.
Other combinations of interaction kernels (spin, charge, electron-phonon) lead
to a suppression of $T_c$ due to phase frustration of the superconducting gap.
We qualitatively argue that the missing ingredient to explain the gap magnitude
and $T_c$ in this material is the first-order correction to the EPI vertex. In
the noninteracting state this correction adopts a form supporting the $s_{\pm}$
gap symmetry, in contrast to EPI within Migdal's approximation, i.e., EPI
without vertex correction, and therefore it enhances tendencies arising from
spin fluctuations.

The main goal of IceCube is the detection of astrophysical neutrinos and the
identification of their sources. High-energy muon neutrinos are observed via
the secondary muons produced in charge current interactions with nuclei in the
ice. Currently, the best performing muon track directional reconstruction is
based on a maximum likelihood method using the arrival time distribution of
Cherenkov photons registered by the experiment's photomultipliers. A known
systematic shortcoming of the prevailing method is to assume a continuous
energy loss along the muon track. However at energies $>1$ TeV the light yield
from muons is dominated by stochastic showers. This paper discusses a
generalized ansatz where the expected arrival time distribution is parametrized
by a stochastic muon energy loss pattern. This more realistic parametrization
of the loss profile leads to an improvement of the muon angular resolution of
up to $20\%$ for through-going tracks and up to a factor 2 for starting tracks
over existing algorithms. Additionally, the procedure to estimate the
directional reconstruction uncertainty has been improved to be more robust
against numerical errors.

Subspace-and-Attention-guided Restoration Network (SARNet) that fuses
multi-spectral features of a THz image for effective restoration. To this end,
SARNet uses multi-scale branches to extract spatio-spectral features of
amplitude and phase which are then fused via shared subspace projection and
attention guidance. Here, we experimentally construct ultra-fast THz
time-domain spectroscopy system covering a broad frequency range from 0.1 THz

$^{173}$Yb Fermi atoms with an orbital Feshbach resonance (OFR). To describe
the BCS-BEC crossover region, we include superfluid fluctuations caused by
inter-band and intra-band pairing interactions associated with OFR, by
extending the strong-coupling theory developed by Nozi\`eres and Schmitt-Rink
to the two-band case below the superfluid phase transition temperature;
however, effects of an experimentally inaccessible deep bound state are
removed, to model a real $^{173}$Yb Fermi gas near OFR. We show that the
condensate fraction in the upper closed channel gradually becomes smaller than
that in the lower open channel, as one moves from the strong- to the
weak-coupling regime, because the OFR-pairing mechanism tunes the interaction
strengths by adjusting the energy difference between the two bands. However,
even when the closed-channel band is much higher in energy than the
open-channel band in the weak-coupling regime, the magnitude of the superfluid
order parameter in the closed channel is found to be still comparable to that
in the open channel. As the reason for this, we point out a pair-tunneling
effect by the OFR-induced inter-band interaction. Besides these superfluid
quantities, we also examine collective modes, such as the Goldstone mode,
Schmid (Higgs) mode, as well as Leggett mode, to clarify how they appear in the
spectral weights of pair-correlation functions in each band. Since the
realization of a multi-band superfluid Fermi gas is a crucial issue in cold
Fermi gas physics, our results would contribute to the basic understanding of
this type of Fermi superfluid in the BCS-BEC crossover region.

Recent works have focused on exploiting past embeddings to increase the number

via augmentation, while the strong focus on seen classes still remains. This
can be undesirable for DML, where training and test data exhibit entirely
different classes. In this work, we present a novel training strategy for DML

exploitation of virtual classes not only utilizes augmented information for
training but also alleviates a strong focus on seen classes for better
generalization. Moreover, we embed the idea of curriculum learning by slowly
adding virtual classes for a gradual increase in learning difficulty, which
improves the learning stability as well as the final performance. MemVir can be
easily applied to many existing loss functions without any modification.
Extensive experimental results on famous benchmarks demonstrate the superiority
of MemVir over state-of-the-art competitors. Code of MemVir is publicly

particular solution of the PDE as well. However the main problem is to find
this compatible ODE. Our generalization is that we look for an ordinary
differential equation that is compatible not with the nonlinear partial
differential equation itself, but with its linearization. Such a generalized
invariant manifold is effectively sought. Moreover, it allows one to construct
such important attributes of integrability theory as Lax pairs and recursion
operators for integrable nonlinear equations. In this paper, we show that they
provide a way to construct particular solutions to the equation as well.

hard, discrete problems. While algorithms exist to solve these problems, they
are problem-specific, and a general framework for surface maps is still in

surface maps. Since neural networks can be composed on one another and are
differentiable, we show it is easy to use them to define surfaces via atlases,
compose them for surface-to-surface mappings, and optimize differentiable
objectives relating to them, such as any notion of distortion, in a trivial
manner. In our experiments, we represent surfaces by generating a neural map
that approximates a UV parameterization of a 3D model. Then, we compose this

geometries do not yet exist, which has limited the understanding and mitigation
of these adverse surfactant effects. To address this issue, we derive a model
for laminar, three-dimensional flow over SHS gratings as a function of geometry
and soluble surfactant properties, which together encompass 10 dimensionless
groups. We establish that the grating length $g$ is the key geometric parameter
and predict that the ratio between actual and surfactant-free slip increases
with $g^2$. Guided by our model, we perform synergistic numerical simulations
and microfluidic experiments, finding good agreement with the theory as we vary
surfactant type and SHS geometry. Our model also enables the estimation, based
on velocity measurements, of a priori unknown properties of surfactants
inherently present in microfluidic systems. For SHSs, we show that surfactant
effects can be predicted by a single parameter, representing the ratio between
the grating length and the interface length scale beyond which the flow
mobilizes the air-water interface. This mobilization length is more sensitive
to the surfactant chemistry than to its concentration, such that even
trace-level contaminants may significantly increase drag if they are highly
surface active. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of

continuously in the low energy range because of the flatter conduction band

in larger redshift of the imaginary part of the dielectric function, loss

distinct states of the molecule conductance, suggesting the coexistence of both
the trans and cis azobenzene isomers on the surface. The cis isomer population

is reversed under blue light irradiation. The experiments are confronted to
first-principle calculations performed on the molecular junctions with the
Non-Equilibrium Green's Function formalism combined with Density Functional
Theory (NEGF/DFT). The theoretical results consider two different molecular
orientations for each isomer. Whereas the orientation does not affect the
conductance of the trans isomer, it significantly modulates the conductance of
the cis isomer and the resulting conductance ON/OFF ratio of the molecular
junction. This helps identifying the molecular orientation at the origin of the
observed current differences between the trans and cis forms. The ON state is
associated to the trans isomer irrespective of its orientation in the junction,
while the OFF state is identified as a cis isomer with its azobenzene moiety
folded upward with respect to the bithiophene core. The experimental and
calculated ON/OFF conductance ratios have a similar order of magnitude. This
conductance ratio seems reasonable to make these Co-AzBT molecular junctions a
good test-bed to further explore the relationship between the spin-polarized
charge transport, the molecule conformation and the molecule-Co spinterface.

event records are created separately from a conceptual model (CM). Techniques
are then used to discover missing processes and conformance with the CM, as
well as for checks and enhancements. By contrast, in this paper we focus on
modeling events as part of a tight multilevel CM that includes a static

build or enrich the CM. The motivation for such a unified system is our thesis
that process mining is an essential component of a CM with built-in mining
capabilities to perform self-process mining and attain completeness.
Accordingly, our proposed conceptual model facilitates collecting data
generated about itself. The resultant framework emphasizes an integrated
representation of systems to include process-mining functionalities. Case
studies that start with event logs are recast to evolve around a model-first

the relative phase of the tunnel couplings between the dot and the Majorana

orbitals, it is in general not experimentally feasible to tune all couplings
individually. This paper shows that such configurations could make it difficult
to avoid a destructive multi-orbital interference effect that substantially
reduces the read-out visibility. We analyze this effect using a Lindblad
quantum master equation. This exposes how the experimentally relevant system
parameters enhance or suppress the visibility when strong charging energy,
measurement dissipation and, most importantly, multi-orbital interference is
accounted for. In particular, we find that an intermediate-time readout could
mitigate some of the interference-related visibility reductions affecting the

steepening found towards the centre of the source. For the first time, a
turnover in the radio spectrum of the two main hotspots of Cygnus A has been
directly observed. By combining our LOFAR imaging with data from the Very Large
Array at higher frequencies, we show that the very rapid turnover in the
hotspot spectra cannot be explained by a low-energy cut-off in the electron
energy distribution, as has been previously suggested. Thermal (free-free)
absorption or synchrotron self absorption models are able to describe the
low-frequency spectral shape of the hotspots, however, as with previous

resonances arising from the hybridization between localized surface plasmons

corresponding LSPs, SLRs exhibit much higher quality factor. In fact, as the
quality factor depends on the constituting resonances and their hybridization,
how one can parametrize it in an analytic form is an important issue. We have
studied the SLRs arising from 2D Au monopartite nanoparticle arrays by angle-

governing the quality factor. We then extend the CMT approach to study
bipartite arrays where nanoparticle dimer is employed and find the coupling
between two LSPs plays a major role in further boosting the quality factor.
Specifically, the coupling takes part in controlling the detuning factor as
well as determining whether the coupled bright or dark mode is hybridized with
the RAs. The dark mode hybridization can strongly enhance the quality factor
which is otherwise not possible in the monopartite counterparts.

a critical mass, above which the gravitational influence of the centrally

caustic of the halo. In the point-mass parameter space we identify the

metamorphoses occur. The number of transitions as a function of position of the

$S$ be an abstract numeration system. When the numeration language $L$ is
prefix-closed and regular, a sequence is said to be $S$-regular if the module
generated by its $S$-kernel is finitely generated.
  In this paper, we give a new characterization of such sequences in terms of
the underlying numeration tree $T(L)$ whose nodes are words of $L$. We may
decorate these nodes by the sequence of interest following a breadth-first
enumeration. For a prefix-closed regular language $L$, we prove that a sequence
is $S$-regular if and only if the tree $T(L)$ decorated by the sequence is
linear, i.e., the decoration of a node depends linearly on the decorations of a
fixed number of ancestors.
  Next, we introduce and study regular sequences in a rational base numeration
system, whose numeration language is known to be highly non-regular. We
motivate and comment our definition that a sequence is $\frac{p}{q}$-regular if
the underlying numeration tree decorated by the sequence is linear. We give the
first few properties of such sequences, we provide a few examples of them, and
we propose a method for guessing $\frac{p}{q}$-regularity. Then we discuss the
relationship between $\frac{p}{q}$-automatic sequences and
$\frac{p}{q}$-regular sequences. We finally present a graph directed linear

mostly on the study of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), providing an
(incomplete) record to supernova activity over the last ~100,000 yr. Here we
report on an investigation of the spatial distribution of Galactic SNRs. Given
the limited number of SNRs it is common to assume a functional form for the
Galactocentric distribution of SNRs. However, several functional forms have
been used in the past, without much justification for the radial distribution.
For example, one often used functional form implies that no supernova activity
is present in the Galactic Centre region. However, the presence of a magnetar
and a SNR near the Galactic Centre suggest that a spatial distribution with
zero SNRs at the Galactic Centre is not realistic. In light of these concerns
we reevaluate the Galactic SNR distribution. We provide a brief outline of the
main detection biases in finding SNRs and we investigate whether or not the use
of the most common functional form is justified and how it compares to other
models for the SNR distribution. We do this by analysing the longitudinal
distribution of SNRs. We find that a simple exponential distribution is the
most consistent and simplest model for describing the radial SNR distribution
in the Galaxy and draw comparisons with the massive star formation and
metallicity distributions.

Introduction of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) for EVCS can cope with
both drawbacks by reducing the load on the grid and generating clean
electricity. This paper develops a methodology based on a weighted
multicriteria process to design the most suitable configuration for HRES in
EVCS. This methodology determines the local renewable resources and the EVCS
electricity demand. Then, taking into account environmental, economic and
technical aspects, it deduces the most adequate HRES design for the EVCS.
Besides, an experimental stage to validate the design deduced from the
multicriteria process is included. Therefore, the final design for the HRES in
EVCS is supported not only by a complete numerical evaluation, but also by an
experimental verification of the demand being fully covered. Methodology
application to Valencia (Spain) proves that an off-grid HRES with solar PV,
wind resources and batteries support would be the most suitable configuration
for the system. This solution was also experimentally verified.

SALT2 light curve fits to the gri ZTF photometry, we show that for these

SALT2 colour $c = 0.57 \pm$ 0.04, while the stretch values $x_1$ of the two SNe
are similar, suggesting that the fainter SN is attenuated by dust in the
interstellar medium of the host galaxy. We use these measurements to infer the
SALT2 colour standardization parameter, $\beta$ = 3.5 $\pm$ 0.3, independent of
the underlying cosmology and Malmquist bias. Assuming the colour excess is
entirely due to dust, the result differs by $2\sigma$ from the average
Milky-Way total-to-selective extinction ratio, but is in good agreement with
the colour-brightness corrections empirically derived from the most recent SN
Ia Hubble-Lemaitre diagram fits. Thus we suggest that SN ""siblings"", which will
increasingly be discovered in the coming years, can be used to probe the
validity of the colour and lightcurve shape corrections using in SN Ia
cosmology while avoiding important systematic effects in their inference from
global multi-parameter fits to inhomogeneous data-sets, and also help constrain

state-of-the-art instruments at ground- and space-based telescopes, and we
particularly benefited from the spectro-polarimetric data acquired with the
Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer, the Crisp Imaging

previous studies in the literature, we computed maps of four quantities which
were representative of the physical properties of solar plasma in each
observation, and estimated the pseudo-Lyapunov exponents from the residuals
between the values of the quantities computed at any point in the map and the
mean of values over the whole map. In contrast to previous results reported in
the literature, we found that the computed exponents hold negative values,
which are typical of a dissipative regime, for all the quantities derived from
our observations. The values of the estimated exponents increase with the
spatial resolution of the data and are almost unaffected by small
concentrations of magnetic field. Finally, we showed that similar results were
also achieved by estimating the exponents from residuals between the values at

complexity. The proposed solution also allows to increase the network's energy

us to gain new insights into their photoluminescence dynamics, revealing the

where the network structural information and inherent properties are maximumly
preserved. Random walk based network embedding methods such as DeepWalk and
node2vec have shown outstanding performance in the aspect of preserving the
network topological structure. However, these approaches either predict the
distribution of a node's neighbors in both direction together, which makes them
unable to capture any asymmetric relationship in a network; or preserve
asymmetric relationship in only one direction and hence lose the one in another
direction. To address these limitations, we propose bidirectional group random
walk based network embedding method (BiGRW), which treats the distributions of
a node's neighbors in the forward and backward direction in random walks as two
different asymmetric network structural information. The basic idea of BiGRW is
to learn a representation for each node that is useful to predict its
distribution of neighbors in the forward and backward direction separately.
Apart from that, a novel random walk sampling strategy is proposed with a
parameter {\alpha} to flexibly control the trade-off between breadth-first
sampling (BFS) and depth-first sampling (DFS). To learn representations from
node attributes, we design an attributed version of BiGRW (BiGRW-AT).
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art plain and
attributed network embedding methods on tasks of node classification and
clustering.

analyzing convergence properties of this algorithm under general graphs. We
first show that there generally exists a graph sequence such that the algorithm
is not convergent when the network switches freely within finitely many general

sufficient condition, i.e., the intersection of optimal solution sets to all
local optimization problems is not empty. Furthermore, we surprisingly find
that the algorithm is convergent for any periodically switching general graph
sequence, and the converged solution minimizes a weighted sum of local cost
functions, where the weights depend on the Perron vectors of some product
matrices of the underlying periodically switching graphs. Finally, we consider
a slightly broader class of quasi-periodically switching graph sequences, and
show that the algorithm is convergent for any quasi-periodic graph sequence if

present a unified framework to calculate the approximate delay distributions of

Container technology is a new cloud technology that boosts the booting of

of the schedulers associated with container technology are focused on load
balancing for increasing container performance. The traffic over networks plays
a significant role in the performance of containers. Container deployment
considering only load balancing may not be the best scheduling strategy due to
the dependency between the applications that might be deployed in different

observations of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the Seyfert 1.5 Galaxy ESO
362-G18. The broadband ($0.3\mbox{--}79$ keV) spectrum shows the presence of a
power-law continuum with a soft excess below $2$ keV, iron K$\alpha$ emission
($\sim 6.4$ keV), and a Compton hump (peaking at $\sim 20$ keV). We find that
the soft excess can be modeled by two different possible scenarios: a warm
($kT_\mathrm{e}\sim0.2$ keV) and optically thick ($\tau\sim34$) Comptonizing
corona; or with relativistically-blurred reflection off a high-density
($\log{[n_\mathrm{e}/\mathrm{cm}^{-3}]}>18.3$) inner disk. These two models
cannot be easily distinguished solely from their fit statistics. However, the
low temperature ($kT_\mathrm{e}\sim20$ keV) and the thick optical depth
($\tau\sim5$) of the hot corona required by the warm corona scenario are
uncommon for AGNs. We also fit a 'hybrid' model, which includes both disk
reflection and a warm corona. Unsurprisingly, as this is the most complex of
the models considered, this provides the best fit, and more reasonable coronal
parameters. In this case, the majority of the soft excess flux arises in the
warm corona component. However, based on recent simulations of warm coronae, it
is not clear whether such a structure can really exist at the low accretion
rates relevant for ESO 362-G18 ($\dot{m}\sim0.015$). This may therefore argue
in favor of a scenario in which the soft excess is instead dominated by the
relativistic reflection. Based on this model, we find that the data would
require a compact hot corona ($h\sim3\,R_\mathrm{Horizon}$) around a highly
spinning ($a_\star>0.927$) black hole.

historical 13-color medium-narrow-band photometric data, gathered with quite

bright spectrophotometric standards well spread in the celestial sphere, the

the literature, that can be used to establish a standard RGB photometric

empirical RGB curves and those determined with the new standard photometric

Irwin's crack closure integral, widely used for the computation of the Energy
Release Rate, also relies upon this assumption. However, there are practical
situations where the load acting on the crack boundaries is singular. This is
the case, for instance, in hydraulic fracturing, where the fluid inside the
crack exerts singular tangential tractions at its front. Another example of
unbounded tractions is the case of a rigid line inclusion (anticrack) embedded
into an elastic body. In such situations, the classical Irwin's crack closure
integral fails to provide the correct value of the Energy Release Rate. In this
paper, we address the effects occurring when square-root singular tractions act
at the boundary of a line defect in an elastic solid and provide a
generalisation of Irwin's crack closure integral. The latter yields the correct
Energy Release Rate and allows broad applications, including, among others,
hydraulic fracturing, soft materials containing stiff inclusions, rigid
inclusions, shear bands and cracks characterized by the Gurtin-Murdoch surface
stress elasticity. We present the results in the most general form, where six
Stress Intensity Factors are present: three of them are classical SIFs
corresponding to the modes I-II-III and computed under the assumption of
homogeneous boundary conditions at the defect surfaces, while the other three
SIFs are associated with singular admissible tractions (those that lead to a
finite ERR value). It is demonstrated that this approach resolves an ambiguity
in using the same SIF's terminology in the cases of open cracks and rigid

of debate. The physical origin of their infrared (IR) excess could be either a
shell of ionized gas, or a dust envelope, or both. This study aims at
constraining the geometry and the IR excess of the environment of the
long-period Cepheid $\ell$ Car (P=35.5 days) at mid-IR wavelengths to
understand its physical nature. We first use photometric observations in
various bands and Spitzer Space Telescope spectroscopy to constrain the IR
excess of $\ell$ Car. Then, we analyze the VLTI/MATISSE measurements at a
specific phase of observation, in order to determine the flux contribution, the
size and shape of the environment of the star in the L band. We finally test
the hypothesis of a shell of ionized gas in order to model the IR excess. We
report the first detection in the L band of a centro-symmetric extended
emission around l Car, of about 1.7$R_\star$ in FWHM, producing an excess of
about 7.0\% in this band. In the N band, there is no clear evidence for dust
emission from VLTI/MATISSE correlated flux and Spitzer data. On the other side,
the modeled shell of ionized gas implies a more compact CSE
($1.13\pm0.02\,R_\star$) and fainter (IR excess of 1\% in the L band). We
provide new evidences for a compact CSE of $\ell$ Car and we demonstrate the
capabilities of VLTI/MATISSE for determining common properties of CSEs. While
the compact CSE of $\ell$ Car is probably of gaseous nature, the tested model
of a shell of ionized gas is not able to simultaneously reproduce the IR excess
and the interferometric observations. Further Galactic Cepheids observations
with VLTI/MATISSE are necessary for determining the properties of CSEs, which
may also depend on both the pulsation period and the evolutionary state of the
stars.

i.e., lossless image compression, we formulate the joint optimization problem
of compressing both the lossy image and the original residual in terms of
variational auto-encoders and solve it with end-to-end training. To achieve
scalable compression with the error bound larger than zero, we derive the
probability model of the quantized residual by quantizing the learned

networks. We further correct the bias of the derived probability model caused
by the context mismatch between training and inference. Finally, the quantized
residual is encoded according to the bias-corrected probability model and is
concatenated with the bitstream of the compressed lossy image. Experimental
results demonstrate that our near-lossless codec achieves the state-of-the-art
performance for lossless and near-lossless image compression, and achieves
competitive PSNR while much smaller $\ell_\infty$ error compared with lossy

have shown promising results. However, due to the limited field-of-view of the
pinhole camera, the performance quickly degrades when large camera movements
are adopted. In this paper, we make the first attempt to generate novel views
from a single indoor panorama and take the large camera translations into
consideration. To tackle this challenging problem, we first use Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract the deep features and estimate the depth map
from the source-view image. Then, we leverage the room layout prior, a strong
structural constraint of the indoor scene, to guide the generation of target
views. More concretely, we estimate the room layout in the source view and
transform it into the target viewpoint as guidance. Meanwhile, we also
constrain the room layout of the generated target-view images to enforce
geometric consistency. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we further
build a large-scale photo-realistic dataset containing both small and large
camera translations. The experimental results on our challenging dataset
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The project

ordered by their aversion to inequality. Given a spectrum and a set $P$ of
attribute weights, a multivariate Gini dominance ordering, being uniform in
weights, is defined. If the endowment vectors are comonotonic, the dominance is
determined by their marginal distributions; if not, the dependence structure of
the endowment distribution has to be taken into account. For this, a set-valued
representative endowment is introduced that characterizes the welfare of a
$d$-dimensioned distribution. It consists of all points above the lower border
of a convex compact in $\R^d$, while the set ordering of representative
endowments corresponds to uniform Gini dominance. An application is given to
the welfare of 28 European countries. Properties of $P$-uniform Gini dominance

of Fe(Se,Te) is longer than the typical thickness of the film ($\sim$100 nm),
we combined the coplanar waveguide resonator and cavity perturbation techniques
to evaluate both the real and imaginary parts of $\sigma$. Films with a nematic

depth and quasiparticle scattering time when compared with those without

structure. Conversely, the proportionality between superfluid density,
$n_\textrm{s}$ ($\propto\lambda^{-2}$), and $T_\textrm{c}$ was observed
irrespective of the presence or absence of nematic order. This result indicates
that the amount of superfluid has a stronger impact on the $T_\textrm{c}$ of
Fe(Se,Te) than the presence or absence of nematic order. Combining these

propose that the change of the Fermi surface associated with nematicity is the

to find $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint paths connecting $s_i$ to $t_i$. The
problem was shown to have an $f(k)n^3$ algorithm by Robertson and Seymour. In
modern terminology, this means that Disjoint Paths is fixed parameter tractable
(FPT), parameterized by the number of vertex pairs. This algorithm is the
cornerstone of the entire graph minor theory, and a vital ingredient in the
$g(k)n^3$ algorithm for Minor Testing (given two undirected graphs, $G$ and $H$
on $n$ and $k$ vertices, respectively, the objective is to check whether $G$
contains $H$ as a minor). All we know about $f$ and $g$ is that these are
computable functions. Thus, a challenging open problem in graph algorithms is
to devise an algorithm for Disjoint Paths where $f$ is single exponential. That
is, $f$ is of the form $2^{{\sf poly}(k)}$. The algorithm of Robertson and
Seymour relies on topology and essentially reduces the problem to
surface-embedded graphs. Thus, the first major obstacle that has to be overcome
in order to get an algorithm with a single exponential running time for
Disjoint Paths and {\sf Minor Testing} on general graphs is to solve Disjoint
Paths in single exponential time on surface-embedded graphs and in particular
on planar graphs. Even when the inputs to Disjoint Paths are restricted to
planar graphs, a case called the Planar Disjoint Paths problem, the best known
algorithm has running time $2^{2^{O(k)}}n^2$. In this paper, we make the first

the network parameters. The parameters are tuned with an iterative quantum
optimisation structure using adaptively selected Hamiltonians. The quantum
mechanism of this framework exploits hidden structure in the QNN optimisation
problem and hence is expected to provide beyond-Grover speed up, mitigating the
barren plateau issue.

To cope with the rapidly fluctuating channel quality, we divide the timeline
into successive time slots according to the channel's coherence time. Robust
computing and offloading decisions are made for each time slot after taking the
channel estimation errors into account. Considering a certain time slot, we
first analytically characterize both the locally computed source data and the

Typically, current approaches employ statistics derived from byte-level

However, modern content types use compression techniques which alter data
distribution pushing it closer to the uniform distribution. The result is that
current approaches exhibit unreliable encryption detection performance when
compressed data appears in the dataset. Furthermore, proposed approaches are
typically evaluated over few data types and fragment sizes, making it hard to
assess their practical applicability. This paper compares existing statistical
tests on a large, standardized dataset and shows that current approaches
consistently fail to distinguish encrypted and compressed data on both small
and large fragment sizes. We address these shortcomings and design EnCoD, a
learning-based classifier which can reliably distinguish compressed and
encrypted data. We evaluate EnCoD on a dataset of 16 different file types and
fragment sizes ranging from 512B to 8KB. Our results highlight that EnCoD
outperforms current approaches by a wide margin, with accuracy ranging from ~82
for 512B fragments up to ~92 for 8KB data fragments. Moreover, EnCoD can
pinpoint the exact format of a given data fragment, rather than performing only
binary classification like previous approaches.

alpha mattes for non-professional users. Some recent deep learning-based
matting networks rely on large-scale composite datasets for training to improve
performance, resulting in the occasional appearance of obvious artifacts when

infers the most informative regions of an image for drawing scribbles to

spreads these scribbles (i.e., the category labels) to the rest of the image

formulating the Hamiltonian picture in the Jordan frame, using the 3-metric

appears linearly only in the scalar constraint. Then, we construct the basic
formalism to characterize the dynamics of a generic inhomogeneous cosmological
model and specialize it in order to describe behaviors of the Bianchi
Universes, both on a classical and a quantum regime. As a fundamental issue, we
demonstrate that, when the potential term of the additional scalar mode is
negligible near enough to the initial singularity, the Bianchi IX cosmology is
no longer affected by the chaotic behavior, typical in vacuum of the standard
Einsteinian dynamics. In fact, the presence of stable Kasner stability region
and its actractive character are properly characterized. Finally, we
investigate the canonical quantization of the Bianchi I model, using as time
variable the non-minimally coupled scalar field and showing that the existence
of a conserved current is outlined for the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt
equation. The behavior of a localized wave-packet for the isotropic Universe is

circuit design or variational optimization is NP-HARD. At the other extreme are
low depth VQA, such as QAOA, with tractable circuit construction and

strongly anisotropic and sensitively depend on the orientation of the line

a line defect running along different directions by using the stationary phase
approximation. Specifically, when the line defect is perpendicular to the
linear dispersion direction, the decay index is -5/4 whereas it becomes -1/4 if
the system is gapped, both of which are different from the decay index -3/2 in
isotropic Dirac systems. In contrast, when the line defect is perpendicular to
the parabolic dispersion direction, the decay index is always -1/2 regardless
of whether the system is gapped or not, which is the same as that in a
conventional semimetal. In general, when the defect runs along an arbitrary
direction, the decay index sensitively depends on the incident energy for a
certain orientation of the line defect. It varies from -5/4 to -1/2 due to the
absence of strict stationary phase point. Our results indicate that the decay

of a yield stress such that YSFs are solid below the yield stress, whereas they
flow like liquids above it. Under an applied shear rate $\dot\gamma$, the
solid-to-liquid transition is associated with a complex spatiotemporal
scenario. Still, the general phenomenology reported in the literature boils
down to a simple sequence that can be divided into a short-time response
characterized by the so-called ""stress overshoot"", followed by stress
relaxation towards a steady state. Such relaxation can be either long-lasting,
which usually involves the growth of a shear band that can be only transient or
that may persist at steady-state, or abrupt, in which case the solid-to-liquid
transition resembles the failure of a brittle material, involving avalanches.
Here we use a continuum model based on a spatially-resolved fluidity approach
to rationalize the complete scenario associated with the shear-induced yielding
of YSFs. Our model provides a scaling for the coordinates of the stress maximum
as a function of $\dot\gamma$, which shows excellent agreement with
experimental and numerical data extracted from the literature. Moreover, our
approach shows that such a scaling is intimately linked to the growth dynamics
of a fluidized boundary layer in the vicinity of the moving boundary. Yet, such
scaling is independent of the fate of that layer, and of the long-term behavior
of the YSF. Finally, when including the presence of ""long-range"" correlations,
we show that our model displays a ductile to brittle transition, i.e., the
stress overshoot reduces into a sharp stress drop associated with avalanches,
which impacts the scaling of the stress maximum with $\dot\gamma$. Our work
offers a unified picture of shear-induced yielding in YSFs, whose complex
spatiotemporal dynamics are deeply connected to non-local effects.

particular, the usual Yukawa Lagrangian responsible for providing masses to the
heavy `mirror' fermions is not gauge invariant. This is because it contains an
SO(5) quintuplet of right-handed fermions that transforms non-linearly under
SU(5), hence involving in general all SO(5) generators when a gauge
transformation is performed and not only those associated to its gauge
subgroup. Part of the solution to this problem consists of completing the
right-handed fermion quintuplet with T-odd `mirror partners' and a gauge
singlet, what has been previously suggested for other purposes. Furthermore, we
find that the singlet must be T-even, the global symmetry group must be
enlarged, an additional non-linear sigma field should be introduced to
parametrize the spontaneous symmetry breaking and new extra fermionic degrees
of freedom are required to give a mass to all fermions in an economic way while
preserving gauge invariance. Finally, we derive the Coleman-Weinberg potential

of integral transforms on the space of weighted, square-integrable functions on

Based on this series representation we construct a system of linear equations
whose solution is an approximation of the Fourier transform of $f$ at
equidistant points. Sampling theory and Fourier inversion allow us to compute
an estimate of $f$ from its $\alpha$-sine transform. The same approach can be
extended to a similar $\alpha$-cosine transform on $\mathbb{R}_+$ for
$\alpha>-1$, and the two-dimensional spherical $\alpha$-sine and cosine
transforms for $\alpha>-1$, $\alpha\neq 0,2,4,\dots$. In an extensive numerical

successful demonstrations can fail to capture task aspects key to robust skill
replication. Here, we propose a learning from demonstration (LfD) approach that
enables learning of robust task definitions without the need for near-optimal

Moreover, we make use of negative demonstrations -- demonstrations of what not

reduce the number of demonstrations needed, and highlight crucial task elements
improving robot performance. In a proof-of-concept example of cart-pole

accepted and used approaches for generating interpretable and physically

input, the arterial input function (AIF), it is still controversial how and
where it should be chosen even though the method is very sensitive to this

model [1] is analysed. As the spacetime is only approximately diffeomorphism
invariant up to powers of $\hbar$, it is not straight forwardly possible to
find global conformally compactified coordinates and to construct the Penrose
diagram. Therefore, radial in- and outgoing light rays are studied to extract
the causal features and sketch a causal diagram. It was found that the eternal
metric [2], which is the vacuum solution of the collapse model, has a causal
horizon. However, in the collapsing case light rays travel through matter to
causally connect the regions in- and outside the horizon -- the causal horizon
is not present in the collapsing scenario. It is worked out that this is
related to the shock wave and spacetime discontinuity, which allows matter
travelling super-luminal along a space-like trajectory from the vacuum point of
view, but remaining time-like from the matter perspective. The final causal
diagram is a compact patch of a Reissner-Nordstr\""om causal diagram. Further,
possibilities of a continuous matter collapse with only time-like evolution are
studied. It was found that the time-reversed vacuum metric is also a solution
of the dynamical equations and a once continuously differentiable matching of
the vacuum spacetime across the minimal radius is possible. This allows an
everywhere continuous and time-like collapse process at the cost of an infinite
extended causal diagram. This solution is part of an infinitely extended
eternal black hole solution with a bounce, whose global extension is

  Mechanics",,"10.1017/jfm.2021.486",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The collision rate of particles suspended in turbulent flow is critical to
particle agglomeration and droplet coalescence. The collision kernel can be
evaluated by the radial distribution function (RDF) and radial relative
velocity (RV) between particles at small separations $r$. Previously, the
smallest $r$ was limited to roughly the Kolmogorov length $\eta$ due to
particle position uncertainty and image overlap. We report a new approach to
measure RDF and RV near contact ($r/a\: \approx$ 2.07, $a$ particle radius)
overcoming these limitations. Three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry
using four-pulse Shake-the-Box algorithm recorded short particle tracks with
the interpolated midpoints registered as particle positions to avoid image
overlap. This strategy further allows removal of mismatched tracks using their
characteristic false RV. We measured RDF and RV in a one-meter-diameter
isotropic turbulence chamber with Taylor Reynolds number $Re_\lambda=324$ with
particles of 12-16 $\mu$m radius and Stokes number $\approx$ 0.7. While at
large $r$ the measured RV agrees with the literature, when $r<20\eta$ the first
moment of negative RV is 10 times higher than direct numerical simulations of
non-interacting particles. Likewise, when $r>\eta$, RDF scales as $r^{-0.39}$
reflecting RDF scaling for polydisperse particles in the literature , but when
$r\lessapprox\eta$ RDF scales as $r^{-6}$, yielding 1000 times higher
near-contact RDF than simulations. Such extreme clustering and relative
velocity enhancement can be attributed to particle-particle interactions.
Uncertainty analysis substantiates the observed trends. This first-ever
simultaneous RDF and RV measurement at small separations provides a clear
glimpse into the clustering and relative velocities of particles in turbulence
near-contact.

can be used for autonomous vehicles to determine drivable areas on roads.
Usually, road curbs are detected on-line using vehicle-mounted sensors, such as
video cameras and 3-D Lidars. However, on-line detection using video cameras
may suffer from challenging illumination conditions, and Lidar-based approaches
may be difficult to detect far-away road curbs due to the sparsity issue of

off-road areas are usually different in aerial images, so we propose a novel
solution to detect road curbs off-line using aerial images. The input to our
method is an aerial image, and the output is directly a graph (i.e., vertices
and edges) representing road curbs. To this end, we formulate the problem as an
imitation learning problem, and design a novel network and an innovative

a denial-of-service scenario where fast gradient-sign method (FGSM) or weak
projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks are used to degrade the model's word

attack forces the system to recognize a specific phrase. We find that the
attack transferability across the investigated ASR systems is limited. To
defend the model, we use two preprocessing defenses: randomized smoothing and
WaveGAN-based vocoder, and find that they significantly improve the model's
adversarial robustness. We show that a WaveGAN vocoder can be a useful
countermeasure to adversarial attacks on ASR systems - even when it is jointly
attacked with the ASR, the target phrases' word error rate is high.

effects in chromium, in contrast to its neighbours in the periodic table, are
weak, leading to the quasiparticle mass enhancement factor ${m^*/m \approx
1.2}$. Our results for local spin-spin correlation functions and distribution
of weigths of atomic configurations indicate that the local magnetic moments
are not formed. Similarly to previous results of DFT at ambient pressure, the
non-uniform magnetic susceptibility as a function of momentum possesses close
to the wave vector ${{\mathbf Q}_{\rm H}=(0,0,2\pi/a)}$ ($a$ is the lattice
constant) sharp maxima, corresponding to Kohn anomalies. We find that these
maxima are preserved by the interaction and are not destroyed by pressure. Our
calculations qualitatively capture a decrease of the N\'eel temperature with
pressure and a breakdown of itinerant antiferomagnetism at pressure of $\sim$9
GPa in agreement with experimental data, although the N\'eel temperature is
significantly overestimated because of the mean-field nature of DMFT.

neural networks for the evaluation of the reduced-order approximation. In
particular, we use KPOD in place of the more classical POD, on a set of
high-fidelity solutions of the problem at hand to extract a reduced basis. This
method provides a more accurate approximation of the snapshots' set featuring a
lower dimension, while maintaining the same efficiency as POD. A neural network
(NN) is then used to find the coefficients of the reduced basis by following a
supervised learning paradigm and shown to be effective in learning the map
between the time/parameter values and the projection of the high-fidelity
snapshots onto the reduced space. In this NN, both the number of hidden layers
and the number of neurons vary according to the intrinsic dimension of the
differential problem at hand and the size of the reduced space. This adaptively
built NN attains good performances in both the learning and the testing phases.
Our approach is then tested on two benchmark problems, a one-dimensional wave
equation and a two-dimensional nonlinear lid-driven cavity problem. We finally
compare the proposed KPOD-NN technique with a POD-NN strategy, showing that
KPOD allows a reduction of the number of modes that must be retained to reach a
given accuracy in the reduced basis approximation. For this reason, the NN
built to find the coefficients of the KPOD expansion is smaller, easier and
less computationally demanding to train than the one used in the POD-NN
strategy.

fully-convolutional network, which estimates the corners of objects directly.
The whole method is end-to-end, does not need any postprocessing steps such as
cosine window and bounding box smoothing, thus largely simplifying existing
tracking pipelines. The proposed tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance
on five challenging short-term and long-term benchmarks, while running at
real-time speed, being 6x faster than Siam R-CNN. Code and models are

of its potentially exponential scaling in the number of electron
configurations. Variational calculation of the two-electron reduced density
matrix (2-RDM) without the many-electron wave function exploits the pairwise
nature of the electronic Coulomb interaction to compute a lower bound on the
ground-state energy with polynomial computational scaling. Recently, a
dual-cone formulation of the variational 2-RDM calculation was shown to
generate the ground-state energy, albeit not the 2-RDM, at a substantially
reduced computational cost, especially for higher $N$-representability
conditions such as the T2 constraint. Here we generalize the dual-cone
variational 2-RDM method to compute not only the ground-state energy but also
the 2-RDM. The central result is that we can compute the 2-RDM from a
generalization of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Specifically, we prove that in
the Lagrangian formulation of the dual-cone optimization the 2-RDM is the
Lagrange multiplier. We apply the method to computing the energies and
properties of strongly correlated electrons -- including atomic charges,
electron densities, dipole moments, and orbital occupations -- in an
illustrative hydrogen chain and the nitrogen-fixation catalyst FeMoco. The dual
variational computation of the 2-RDM with T2 or higher $N$-representability
conditions provides a polynomially scaling approach to strongly correlated
molecules and materials with significant applications in atomic and molecular
and condensed-matter chemistry and physics.

that Einstein's gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensor, including its
superpotential, is fixed, through Noether's theorem, by the boundary terms in
the action. That is, the freedom to add an arbitrary superpotential to the
gravitational pseudo-tensor corresponds to the freedom to add boundary terms to
the action without changing the equations of motion. This freedom is fixed in
the same way for both problems. I also review two proposals for energy and
momentum in GR, of which one is a quasi-local alternative to the local
expressions, and the other builds on Einstein's local pseudo-tensor approach. I
discuss the recent philosophical literature on the conservation of energy and
momentum in general relativity, and I assess and compare the two proposals in
the light of this literature: especially, in light of questions about
diffeomorphism invariance and background-independence.

technological advances, namely 5G communications, Internet of Things,
artificial intelligence and edge computing. Central to this is the wide
deployment of smart sensing devices and accordingly the large amount of
harvested information to be processed for timely decision making. Robust
network access is, hence, essential for offloading the collected data before a
set deadline, beyond which the data loses its value. In environments where
direct communication can be impaired by, for instance, blockages such as in
urban cities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be considered as an
alternative for providing and enhancing connectivity, particularly when IoT
devices (IoTD) are constrained with their resources. Also, to conserve energy,
IoTDs are assumed to alternate between their active and passive modes. This
paper, therefore, considers a time-constrained data gathering problem from a
network of sensing devices and with assistance from a UAV. A Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surface (RIS) is deployed to further improve both the connectivity
and energy efficiency of the UAV, particularly when multiple devices are served
concurrently and experience different channel impairments. This integrated
problem brings challenges related to the configuration of the phase shift
elements of the RIS, the scheduling of IoTDs transmissions as well as the
trajectory of the UAV. First, the problem is formulated with the objective of
maximizing the total number of served devices each during its activation
period. Owing to its complexity and the incomplete knowledge about the
environment, we leverage deep reinforcement learning in our solution; the UAV
trajectory planning is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, and Proximal
Policy Optimization is invoked to solve it. Next, the RIS configuration is then
handled via Block Coordinate Descent.

quarks are obtained in the QTM at leading order. We demonstrate gauge
invariance of the results by comparing both covariant and light cone gauges,
with the former including an explicit Wilson line contribution. A key finding
is that in covariant gauges the Wilson line can carry a significant amount of
the light cone momentum. With coupling strength $\alpha_s = 0.5$ and dressed
quark mass $M_q = 0.4\,$GeV, we find quark and gluon momentum fractions of
$\left<x\right>_q = 0.81$ and $\left<x\right>_g = 0.19$, where the Wilson line
contribution to the quark momentum fraction is $-0.18$. We use the on-shell
renormalization scheme and find that at one-loop this Wilson line contribution
does not depend on the covariant gauge but does vanish in light cone gauge as
expected. This result demonstrates that it is crucial to account for Wilson
line contributions when calculating quantum correlation functions in covariant

technique to investigate the electronic band structure of crystalline solids.
To completely characterize the electronic structure of topological materials,
one needs to go beyond band structure mapping and access information about the
momentum-resolved Bloch wavefunction, namely orbitals, Berry curvature, and
topological invariants. However, because phase information is lost in the
process of measuring photoemission intensities, retrieving the complex-valued
Bloch wavefunction from photoemission data has yet remained elusive. We
introduce a novel measurement methodology and associated observable in extreme
ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, based on continuous
modulation of the ionizing radiation polarization axis. Tracking the energy-
and momentum-resolved amplitude and phase of the photoemission intensity
modulation upon polarization axis rotation allows us to retrieve the circular
dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions (CDAD) without using circular
photons, providing direct insights into the phase of photoemission matrix
elements. In case of two relevant bands, it is possible to reconstruct the
orbital pseudospin (and thus the Bloch wavefunction) with moderate theory
input, as demonstrated for the prototypical layered semiconducting transition
metal dichalcogenide 2H-WSe$_2$. This novel measurement methodology in ARPES,
which is articulated around the manipulation of the photoionization transition
dipole matrix element, in combination with a simple tight-binding theory, is
general and adds a new dimension to obtaining insights into the orbital
pseudospin, Berry curvature, and Bloch wavefunctions of many relevant
crystalline solids.

unseen during training. Such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting
easy-to-learn, or statistically dominant, features while disregarding other
potentially informative features. For example, indistinguishable differences in
the sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the
performance of the network significantly. All neural networks intended for
clinical practice need to be robust to variation in data caused by differences
in imaging equipment, sample preparation and patient populations.
  To address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling
as an implicit bias mitigation method. Spectral decoupling encourages the
neural network to learn more features by simply regularising the networks'
unnormalised prediction scores with an L2 penalty, thus having no added
computational costs.
  We show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets
with strong spurious correlations and increases networks' robustness for data
distribution shifts. To validate our findings, we train networks with and
without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer tissue slides and
COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Networks trained with spectral decoupling
achieve up to 9.5 percent point higher performance on external datasets.
  Our results show that spectral decoupling helps with generalisation issues
associated with neural networks, and can be used to complement or replace
computationally expensive explicit bias mitigation methods, such as stain
normalization in histological images. We recommend using spectral decoupling as
an implicit bias mitigation method in any neural network intended for clinical

However, the convergence speed of the SPGD algorithm will slow down as the

convolutional neural network is introduced to quickly calculate the initial
piston aberration in a single step. In addition, the irrationality of the
commonly used Mean Square Error (MSE) evaluation function in existing

compensation, which means that the system directly enters the co-phase state.
We also demonstrate the robustness and scalability by adding additional

and [CI] (93 %) luminosity. The region shows very extended [NII] emission
(spatially correlated with the 24 and 70 um dust emission). The observed FIR
luminosities imply G_0~10^3. The extended [CI] emission arises from a pervasive
component of neutral gas with n_H~10^3 cm-3. The high ionization rates,
produced by enhanced cosmic-ray (CR) fluxes, drive the gas heating to Tk~40-60
K. The mid-J CO emission arises from a similarly extended but more pressurized
gas component (P_th~10^7 K cm-3). Specific regions of enhanced SiO emission and
high CO-to-FIR intensity ratios (>10^-3) show mid-J CO emission compatible with
shock models. A major difference compared to more quiescent star-forming clouds
in the disk of our Galaxy is the extended nature of the SiO and N2H+ emission
in Sgr B2. This can be explained by the presence of cloud-scale shocks, induced
by cloud-cloud collisions and stellar feedback, and the much higher CR
ionization rate (>10^-15 s-1) leading to overabundant H3+ and N2H+. Hence, Sgr
B2 hosts a more extreme environment than star-forming regions in the disk of
the Galaxy. As a usual template for extragalactic comparisons, Sgr B2 shows
more similarities to ultra luminous infrared galaxies such as Arp 220,
including a ""deficit"" in the [CI]/FIR and [NII]/FIR intensity ratios, than to
pure starburst galaxies such as M82. However, it is the extended cloud
environment, rather than the cores, that serves as a useful template when
telescopes do not resolve such extended regions in galaxies.

of automatically identifying the k most interesting aggregate queries that can
be evaluated on an RDF graph, given an integer k and a user-specified

warehouses in that (i) in an RDF graph we are not given but we must identify
the facts, dimensions, and measures of candidate aggregates; (ii) the classical
approach to efficiently evaluating multiple aggregates breaks in the face of
multi-valued dimensions in RDF data. In this work, we propose an extensible
end-to-end framework that enables the identification and evaluation of
interesting aggregates based on a new RDF-compatible one-pass algorithm for
efficiently evaluating a lattice of aggregates and a novel early-stop technique
(with probabilistic guarantees) that can prune uninteresting aggregates.
Experiments using both real and synthetic graphs demonstrate the ability of our
framework to find interesting aggregates in a large search space, the
efficiency of our algorithms (with up to 2.9x speedup over a similar pipeline
based on existing algorithms), and scalability as the data size and complexity
grow.

change and a photonic nanojet is generated which will engineer the far-field

distribution in the far-field can be engineered by photonic nanojet. As an
example, we examine prolate, sphere, and ablate geometries. An interesting

car park with $n$ spots. In order, each driver goes to their chosen spot and
parks there if possible, and otherwise takes the next available spot if it
exists. If all drivers park successfully, the sequence of choices is called a
parking function. Classical parking functions correspond to the case $m=n$; we
study here combinatorial and probabilistic aspects of this generalized case.
  We construct a family of bijections between parking functions $\text{PF}(m,
n)$ with $m$ cars and $n$ spots and spanning forests $\mathscr{F}(n+1, n+1-m)$
with $n+1$ vertices and $n+1-m$ distinct trees having specified roots. This
leads to a bijective correspondence between $\text{PF}(m, n)$ and monomial
terms in the associated Tutte polynomial of a disjoint union of $n-m+1$
complete graphs. We present an identity between the ""inversion enumerator"" of
spanning forests with fixed roots and the ""displacement enumerator"" of parking
functions. The displacement is then related to the number of graphs on $n+1$
labeled vertices with a fixed number of edges, where the graph has $n+1-m$
disjoint rooted components with specified roots.
  We investigate various probabilistic properties of a uniform parking
function, giving a formula for the law of a single coordinate. As a side result
we obtain a recurrence relation for the displacement enumerator. Adapting known
results on random linear probes, we further deduce the covariance between two
coordinates when $m=n$.

geometry processing. Of particular interest is the study of the Laplacian
spectrum as a compact, isometry and permutation-invariant representation of a
shape. Some recent works show how the intrinsic geometry of a full shape can be
recovered from its spectrum, but there are approaches that consider the more
challenging problem of recovering the geometry from the spectral information of
partial shapes. In this paper, we propose a possible way to fill this gap. We
introduce a learning-based method to estimate the Laplacian spectrum of the
union of partial non-rigid 3D shapes, without actually computing the 3D
geometry of the union or any correspondence between those partial shapes. We do
so by operating purely in the spectral domain and by defining the union
operation between short sequences of eigenvalues. We show that the approximated
union spectrum can be used as-is to reconstruct the complete geometry [MRC*19],
perform region localization on a template [RTO*19] and retrieve shapes from a
database, generalizing ShapeDNA [RWP06] to work with partialities. Working with
eigenvalues allows us to deal with unknown correspondence, different sampling,
and different discretizations (point clouds and meshes alike), making this
operation especially robust and general. Our approach is data-driven and can
generalize to isometric and non-isometric deformations of the surface, as long
as these stay within the same semantic class (e.g., human bodies or horses), as
well as to partiality artifacts not seen at training time.

each added data set in turn. More specifically, we sequentially integrate five
different data sets, which have not all been combined in earlier bioinformatic
methods for predicting drug responses. Empirical experiments show that DIVERSE
clearly outperformed five other methods including three state-of-the-art

which is closer to the setting of real use cases and more challenging than
simpler in-matrix prediction. Additionally, case studies for discovering new
drugs further confirmed the performance advantage of DIVERSE.

however, characterization of these aerosols is challenging due to their dynamic
nature. Here we present a method that directly measures the volatility of
particulate matter (PM) using computational microscopy and deep learning. This
method was applied to aerosols generated by electronic cigarettes (e-cigs),
which vaporize a liquid mixture (e-liquid) that mainly consists of propylene
glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and flavoring compounds. E-cig
generated aerosols were recorded by a field-portable computational microscope,
using an impaction-based air sampler. A lensless digital holographic microscope
inside this mobile device continuously records the inline holograms of the
collected particles. A deep learning-based algorithm is used to automatically
reconstruct the microscopic images of e-cig generated particles from their
holograms, and rapidly quantify their volatility. To evaluate the effects of
e-liquid composition on aerosol dynamics, we measured the volatility of the
particles generated by flavorless, nicotine-free e-liquids with various PG/VG
volumetric ratios, revealing a negative correlation between the particles'
volatility and the volumetric ratio of VG in the e-liquid. For a given PG/VG
composition, the addition of nicotine dominated the evaporation dynamics of the
e-cig aerosol and the aforementioned negative correlation was no longer
observed. We also revealed that flavoring additives in e-liquids significantly
decrease the volatility of e-cig aerosol. The presented holographic volatility
measurement technique and the associated mobile device might provide new
insights on the volatility of e-cig generated particles and can be applied to
characterize various volatile PM.

interpolation of noisy data should lead to poor generalization. A related
heuristic is that fitting parameters should be fewer than measurements (Occam's
Razor). Surprisingly, contemporary machine learning (ML) approaches, cf. deep
nets (DNNs), generalize well despite interpolating noisy data. This may be
understood via Statistically Consistent Interpolation (SCI), i.e. data
interpolation techniques that generalize optimally for big data. In this
article we elucidate SCI using the weighted interpolating nearest neighbors
(wiNN) algorithm, which adds singular weight functions to kNN (k-nearest
neighbors). This shows that data interpolation can be a valid ML strategy for
big data. SCI clarifies the relation between two ways of modeling natural
phenomena: the rationalist approach (strong priors) of theoretical physics with
few parameters and the empiricist (weak priors) approach of modern ML with more
parameters than data. SCI shows that the purely empirical approach can
successfully predict. However data interpolation does not provide theoretical
insights, and the training data requirements may be prohibitive. Complex animal
brains are between these extremes, with many parameters, but modest training
data, and with prior structure encoded in species-specific mesoscale circuitry.
Thus, modern ML provides a distinct epistemological approach different both
from physical theories and animal brains.

that in addition to the tetrad or metric, they employ a flat connection as

geometric formulation using a tetrad or metric as fundamental field variable,
one has different choices to introduce the conditions of vanishing curvature,

equations is obtained, independently of the choice of the geometric formulation

The models assert that documents are distributions over latent topics and
latent topics are distributions over words. A nested document collection is
where documents are nested inside a higher order structure such as stories in a
book, articles in a journal, or web pages in a web site. In a single collection
of documents, topics are global, or shared across all documents. For web pages
nested in web sites, topic frequencies likely vary between web sites. Within a
web site, topic frequencies almost certainly vary between web pages. A
hierarchical prior for topic frequencies models this hierarchical structure and
specifies a global topic distribution. Web site topic distributions vary around
the global topic distribution and web page topic distributions vary around the
web site topic distribution. In a nested collection of web pages, some topics
are likely unique to a single web site. Local topics in a nested collection of
web pages are topics unique to one web site. For US local health department web
sites, brief inspection of the text shows local geographic and news topics
specific to each department that are not present in others. Topic models that
ignore the nesting may identify local topics, but do not label topics as local
nor do they explicitly identify the web site owner of the local topic. For web
pages nested inside web sites, local topic models explicitly label local topics
and identifies the owning web site. This identification can be used to adjust
inferences about global topics. In the US public health web site data, topic
coverage is defined at the web site level after removing local topic words from
pages. Hierarchical local topic models can be used to identify local topics,
adjust inferences about if web sites cover particular health topics, and study
how well health topics are covered.

implementing a two-stage algorithm that learns time-based topics with respect
to a scale of document positions and introduces the concept of Topic Scaling
which ranks learned topics within the same document scale. The first stage
ranks documents using Wordfish, a Poisson-based document scaling method, to
estimate document positions that serve, in the second stage, as a dependent
variable to learn relevant topics via a supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
This novelty brings two innovations in text mining as it explains document
positions, whose scale is a latent variable, and ranks the inferred topics on
the document scale to match their occurrences within the corpus and track their
evolution. Tested on the U.S. State Of The Union two-party addresses, this
inductive approach reveals that each party dominates one end of the learned
scale with interchangeable transitions that follow the parties' term of office.
Besides a demonstrated high accuracy in predicting in-sample documents'
positions from topic scores, this method reveals further hidden topics that
differentiate similar documents by increasing the number of learned topics to
unfold potential nested hierarchical topic structures. Compared to other
popular topic models, Topic Scaling learns topics with respect to document
similarities without specifying a time frequency to learn topic evolution, thus
capturing broader topic patterns than dynamic topic models and yielding more
interpretable outputs than a plain latent Dirichlet allocation.

systems designed with deep learning. The shifts can be caused by sensor
characteristic variations and/or discrepancies between the design-phase model
and the actual model of the sensed physical process. To address these issues,
existing transfer learning techniques require substantial target-domain data
and thus incur high post-deployment overhead. This paper proposes to exploit
the first principle governing the domain shift to reduce the demand on
target-domain data. Specifically, our proposed approach called PhyAug uses the
first principle fitted with few labeled or unlabeled source/target-domain data
pairs to transform the existing source-domain training data into augmented data
for updating the deep neural networks. In two case studies of keyword spotting
and DeepSpeech2-based automatic speech recognition, with 5-second unlabeled
data collected from the target microphones, PhyAug recovers the recognition
accuracy losses due to microphone characteristic variations by 37% to 72%. In a
case study of seismic source localization with TDoA fngerprints, by exploiting
the frst principle of signal propagation in uneven media, PhyAug only requires
3% to 8% of labeled TDoA measurements required by the vanilla fingerprinting
approach in achieving the same localization accuracy.

The best performance of NILM algorithms is achieved with high-quality
evaluation data. However, many existing real-world data sets come with a low
sampling quality, and often with gaps, lacking data for some recording periods.
As a result, in such data, NILM algorithms can hardly recognize devices and
estimate their power consumption properly. An important step towards improving
the performance of these energy disaggregation methods is to improve the
quality of the data sets. In this paper, we carry out experiments using several
methods to increase the sampling rate of low sampling rate data. Our results
show that augmentation of low-frequency data can support the considered NILM
algorithms in estimating appliances' consumption with a higher F-score
measurement.

Transformers can achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art results on
many image classification tasks. This puts transformers in the unique position
of being a promising alternative to traditional convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). While CNNs have been carefully studied with respect to adversarial
attacks, the same cannot be said of Vision Transformers. In this paper, we
study the robustness of Vision Transformers to adversarial examples. Our
analyses of transformer security is divided into three parts. First, we test
the transformer under standard white-box and black-box attacks. Second, we
study the transferability of adversarial examples between CNNs and
transformers. We show that adversarial examples do not readily transfer between
CNNs and transformers. Based on this finding, we analyze the security of a
simple ensemble defense of CNNs and transformers. By creating a new attack, the
self-attention blended gradient attack, we show that such an ensemble is not
secure under a white-box adversary. However, under a black-box adversary, we
show that an ensemble can achieve unprecedented robustness without sacrificing
clean accuracy. Our analysis for this work is done using six types of white-box
attacks and two types of black-box attacks. Our study encompasses multiple
Vision Transformers, Big Transfer Models and CNN architectures trained on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.

  Equivalence and Mutual Information","15 pages",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Point cloud analysis is still a challenging task due to the disorder and
sparsity of samplings of their geometric structures from 3D sensors. In this
paper, we introduce the homotopy equivalence relation (HER) to make the neural
networks learn the data distribution from a high-dimension manifold. A shuffle
operation is adopted to construct HER for its randomness and zero-parameter. In
addition, inspired by prior works, we propose a local mutual information
regularizer (LMIR) to cut off the trivial path that leads to a classification
error from HER. LMIR utilizes mutual information to measure the distance
between the original feature and HER transformed feature and learns common
features in a contrastive learning scheme. Thus, we combine HER and LMIR to
give our model the ability to learn non-Euclidean features from a
high-dimension manifold. This is named the non-Euclidean feature learner.
Furthermore, we propose a new heuristics and efficiency point sampling
algorithm named ClusterFPS to obtain approximate uniform sampling but at faster
speed. ClusterFPS uses a cluster algorithm to divide a point cloud into several
clusters and deploy the farthest point sampling algorithm on each cluster in
parallel. By combining the above methods, we propose a novel point cloud
analysis neural network called PointShuffleNet (PSN), which shows great promise
in point cloud classification and segmentation. Extensive experiments show that
our PSN achieves state-of-the-art results on ModelNet40, ShapeNet and S3DIS
with high efficiency. Theoretically, we provide mathematical analysis toward
understanding of what the data distribution HER has developed and why LMIR can
drop the trivial path by maximizing mutual information implicitly.

by a value on a fixed opinion interval. We propose an alternative modeling
method wherein interpretation is only provided to the relative positions of
opinions vis-\`a-vis each other. This method is then considered in a similar
setting as the discrete-time Altafini model (an extension of the well-known
DeGroot model), but with more general influence weights. Even in a linear
framework, the model can describe, in the long run, polarization, dynamics with
a periodic pattern, and (modulus) consensus formation. In addition, in our
alternative approach key characteristics of the opinion dynamic can be derived
from real-valued square matrices of influence weights, which immediately allows
one to transfer matrix theory insights to the field of opinion formation
dynamics under more relaxed conditions than in the DeGroot or discrete-time
Altafini models. A few specific themes are covered: (i) We demonstrate how
stable patterns in relative opinion dynamics are identified which are hidden
when opinions are considered in an absolute opinion framework. (ii) For the
two-agent case, we provide an exhaustive closed-form description of the
relative opinion model's dynamic in the long run. (iii) We explore group
dynamics analytically, in particular providing a non-trivial condition under
which a subgroup's asymptotic behavior carries over to the entire population.
