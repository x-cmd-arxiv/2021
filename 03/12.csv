learning algorithms, requiring thousands of question-answer pairs as training
examples or natural language processing pipelines that need module fine-tuning.
In this paper, we present a novel QA approach, dubbed TeBaQA. Our approach
learns to answer questions based on graph isomorphisms from basic graph
patterns of SPARQL queries. Learning basic graph patterns is efficient due to
the small number of possible patterns. This novel paradigm reduces the amount
of training data necessary to achieve state-of-the-art performance. TeBaQA also
speeds up the domain adaption process by transforming the QA system development
task into a much smaller and easier data compilation task. In our evaluation,
TeBaQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on QALD-8 and delivers comparable
results on QALD-9 and LC-QuAD v1. Additionally, we performed a fine-grained
evaluation on complex queries that deal with aggregation and superlative
questions as well as an ablation study, highlighting future research
challenges.

with archival data including Spitzer and Herschel continuum maps for further
analysis. Filamentary sub-structures labeled as F1 to F6 were extracted in
L1251, with F1 being associated with L1251-A hosting L1251-1. The peak
positions of dense gas traced by HCO$^+$ are misaligned relative to those of
the dust clumps. Episodic outflows are common in this region. The twisted
morphology of F1 and velocity distribution along L1251-A may originate from
stellar feedback. SCCC in L1251-1 may have been caused by outflow activities
originated from the infrared source IRS1. The signposts of ongoing SCCC and the
broadened line widths of C$_3$S and C$_4$H in L1251-1 as well as the

L1251-1 (IRS1) together with the previously identified SCCC source IRS3

external changes in their execution environment, captured as contexts. The COP
paradigm posits a technique for the development of self-adaptive systems,
capturing their main characteristics with specialized programming language
constructs. COP adaptations are specified as independent modules composed in
and out of the base system as contexts are activated and deactivated in
response to sensed circumstances from the surrounding environment. However, the
definition of adaptations, their contexts and associated specialized behavior,
need to be specified at design time. In complex CPS this is intractable due to
new unpredicted operating conditions. We propose Auto-COP, a new technique to
enable generation of adaptations at run time. Auto-COP uses RL options to build
action sequences, based on the previous instances of the system execution.
Options are explored in interaction with the environment, and the most suitable
options for each context are used to generate adaptations exploiting COP. To
validate Auto-COP, we present two case studies exhibiting different system
characteristics and application domains: a driving assistant and a robot
delivery system. We present examples of Auto-COP code generated at run time, to
illustrate the types of circumstances (contexts) requiring adaptation, and the
corresponding generated adaptations for each context. We confirm that the
generated adaptations exhibit correct system behavior measured by
domain-specific performance metrics, while reducing the number of required
execution/actuation steps by a factor of two showing that the adaptations are
regularly selected by the running system as adaptive behavior is more
appropriate than the execution of primitive actions.

Health Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on how to reduce the spread
of the virus and one of the most important measures is social distancing.
Maintaining a minimum of one meter distance from other people is strongly
suggested to reduce the risk of infection. This has created a strong interest
in monitoring the social distances either as a safety measure or to study how
the measures have affected human behavior and country-wise differences in this.
The need for automatic social distance estimation algorithms is evident, but
there is no suitable test benchmark for such algorithms. Collecting images with
measured ground-truth pair-wise distances between all the people using
different camera settings is cumbersome. Furthermore, performance evaluation
for social distance estimation algorithms is not straightforward and there is
no widely accepted evaluation protocol. In this paper, we provide a dataset of
varying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera
positionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation
protocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation
algorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation.
Our method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation. It
can be applied on any single image as long as focal length and sensor size
information are known. The results on our benchmark are encouraging with 92%
human detection rate and only 28.9% average error in distance estimation among
the detected people.

WPA2/WPA3 solutions take user interaction and a strong passphrase for granted.
However, the often weak passphrases are subject to guessing attacks. Notably,
there has been a significant rise of cyberattacks on Wi-Fi home or small office

Physical Layer Security and extracts credentials from common random physical

superior compared to previous proposals: First, it employs phase information
(rather than amplitude or signal strength) to generate the passphrase so that
it is robust, scaleable, and impossible to guess. Our analysis showed that
ComPass generated passphrases have 3 times more entropy than human generated
passphrases (113-bits vs. 34-bits). Second, ComPass selects parameters such
that two devices bind only within a certain proximity (less than 3m), hence
providing practically useful in-build PLS-based authentiation. ComPass is

this problem, the embedding should be stable in the sense that it should not
change on the existing tuples due to the embedding of newly inserted tuples (as
database applications might already rely on existing embeddings); at the same
time, the embedding of all tuples, old and new, should retain high quality.
This task is challenging since inter-dependencies among the embeddings of
different entities are inherent in state-of-the-art embedding techniques for
structured data. We study two approaches to solving the problem. The first is
an adaptation of Node2Vec to dynamic databases. The second is the FoRWaRD
algorithm (Foreign Key Random Walk Embeddings for Relational Databases) that
draws from embedding techniques for general graphs and knowledge graphs, and is
inherently utilizing the schema and its key and foreign-key constraints. We

of cost and accuracy, corrections (e.g., DFT+U) that improve it are often
needed to tackle correlated transition-metal chemistry. In principle, the
functional form of DFT+U, consisting of a set of localized atomic orbitals (AO)
and a quadratic energy penalty for deviation from integer occupations of those
AOs, enables the recovery of the exact conditions of piecewise linearity and
the derivative discontinuity. Nevertheless, for practical transition-metal
complexes, where both atomic states and ligand orbitals participate in bonding,
standard DFT+U can fail to eliminate delocalization error (DE). Here, we show
that by introducing an alternative valence-state (i.e., molecular orbital or
MO) basis to the DFT+U approach, we recover exact conditions in cases where
standard DFT+U corrections have no error-reducing effect. This MO-based DFT+U
also eliminates DE where standard AO-based DFT+U is already successful. We
demonstrate the transferability of our approach on a range of ligand field
strengths (i.e., from H_2O to CO), electron configurations (i.e., from Sc to Fe
to Zn), and spin states (i.e., low-spin and high-spin) in representative

transition whereby a material in an initially solid-like state then yields
plastically. Major unresolved questions concern whether any material will yield
smoothly and gradually (ductile behaviour) or fail abruptly and
catastrophically (brittle behaviour); the roles of sample annealing, disorder
and shear band formation in the onset of yielding and failure; and, most
importantly from a practical viewpoint, whether any impending catastrophic
failure can be anticipated before it happens. We address these questions by
studying the yielding of slowly sheared athermal amorphous materials, within a
minimal mesoscopic lattice elastoplastic model. Our contributions are fourfold.
First, we elucidate whether yielding will be ductile or brittle, for any given
level of sample annealing. Second, we show that yielding comprises two distinct
stages: a pre-failure stage, in which small levels of strain heterogeneity
slowly accumulate, followed by a catastrophic brittle failure event, in which a
crack quickly propagates across the sample via a cooperating line of plastic
events. Third, we provide an expression for the slowly growing level of strain
heterogeneity in the pre-failure stage, expressed in terms of the macroscopic
stress-strain curve and the sample size, and in excellent agreement with our
simulation results. Fourth, we elucidate the basic mechanism via which a crack
then nucleates and provide an approximate expression for the probability
distribution of shear strains at which failure occurs, as determined by the
disorder inherent in the sample, expressed in terms of a single annealing
parameter, and the system size.

solve optimization problems over uncertain data, right where the data resides.
Prior work in stochastic programming uses Monte Carlo methods where the
original stochastic optimization problem is approximated by a large
deterministic optimization problem that incorporates many scenarios, i.e.,
sample realizations of the uncertain data values. For large database tables,
however, a huge number of scenarios is required, leading to poor performance

dynamic wireless communication channels are characterized by rapidly changing
channel statistics. In this paper we present the first fully mobile multi-node
vehicular wireless channel sounding system, which is capable of simultaneously
capturing multiple channel frequency responses, ensuring that measurement
conditions are identical for all observed links. We use it to analyze road
scenarios with multiple vehicles and a large obstructing double-decker bus. The
empirical measurement data is used to parametrize a model for the large
obstructing vehicle within a geometry-based stochastic channel model. We
compare the time-variant channel statistics obtained from our channel model
with the ones from the measurement campaign. By means of a channel emulator we
obtain the packet error rates of commercial modems for the measured and the
simulated wireless communication channels and compare them, in order to
validate the model at the link level. We find that the path loss, the root mean
square (RMS) delay spread, and the RMS Doppler spread deviate by less than
$3.6\,\mathrm{dB}$, $78\,\mathrm{ns}$, and $52\,\mathrm{Hz}$, respectively, for
$80\%$ of the total simulation duration. The PER obtained from measured data is
within the maximum and minimum bounds of our model for $86\%$ of the simulation

robotic applications, most of the methods only partially solve the problem by
focusing solely on known object categories. However, for robots interacting in
dynamic and cluttered environments, this is not realistic and severely limits
the range of potential applications. Therefore, we propose a novel object
instance segmentation approach that does not require any semantic or geometric
information of the objects beforehand. In contrast to existing works, we do not
explicitly use depth data as input, but rely on the insight that slight
viewpoint changes, which for example are provided by stereo image pairs, are
often sufficient to determine object boundaries and thus to segment objects.
Focusing on the versatility of stereo sensors, we employ a transformer-based
architecture that maps directly from the pair of input images to the object
instances. This has the major advantage that instead of a noisy, and
potentially incomplete depth map as an input, on which the segmentation is
computed, we use the original image pair to infer the object instances and a
dense depth map. In experiments in several different application domains, we
show that our Instance Stereo Transformer (INSTR) algorithm outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods that are based on depth maps. Training code and
pretrained models will be made available.

'edge geometry' of a regular N-gon, but they are all based on piecewise
isometries acting on the extended edges of N to form a 'singularity' set W.
This singularity set is also known as the 'web' because it is connected and
consists of rays or line segments, with possible accumulation points in the
limit. We will use three such maps here, all of which appear to share the same
local geometry of W. These mappings are the outer-billiards map Tau, the
digital-filter map Df and the 'dual-center' map Dc. In 'Outer-billiards,
digital filters and kicked Hamiltonians' (arXiv:1206.5223) we show that the Df
and Dc maps are equivalent to a 'shear and rotation' in a toral space and in
the complex plane respectively, and in 'First Families of Regular Polygons and
their Mutations' (arXiv:1612.09295) we show that the web for Tau can also be
reduced to a shear and rotation. This equivalence of maps supports the premise
that this web geometry is inherent in the N-gon. Here we describe the edge
geometry up to N = 25 and in Part 2 this will be extended to N = 50. In all
cases this geometry defines an invariant region local to N. Typically this
region contains multiple S[k] 'tiles' from the First Family of N, but our
emphasis is on the S[1] and S[2] tiles adjacent to N. Since the web evolves in
a multi-step fashion, it is possible to make predictions about the
'next-generation' tiles which will survive in the early web of S[1] and S[2].
The Edge Conjecture defines just 8 classes of N-gons based on this edge
geometry so there is an 'Eightfold Way' for regular polygons.

time-averaged (annealed) conductance in the insulating regime and find three
distinct insulating phases, separated by two transitions. The first occurs
between a non-resonating insulator and an intermittent metal. The average
conductance is always dominated by rare temporal fluctuations. However, in the
intermittent metal, they are so strong that the system becomes metallic for an
exponentially small fraction of the time. A second transition occurs within
that phase. At stronger disorder, there is a single optimal path providing the
dominant contribution to the conductance at all times, but closer to
delocalization, a transition to a phase with fluctuating paths occurs. This
last phase displays the quantum analogon of configurational chaos in glassy
systems in that thermal fluctuations induce significant changes of the dominant
decay channels. While in the insulator the annealed conductance is strictly
bigger than the conductance with typical, frozen disorder, we show that the
threshold to delocalization is insensitive to whether or not thermal
fluctuations are admitted. This rules out a potential bistability, at fixed
disorder, of a localized phase with suppressed internal fluctuations and a
delocalized, internally fluctuating phase.

study the geometry of the limiting configuration as $\mu\longrightarrow+\infty$
on a planar domain for any number of species. If $k$ is even we show that some
limiting configurations are strictly connected to the solution of a Dirichlet
problem for the Laplace equation.

effective. To ensure this, medical device manufacturers must comply to the new
regulatory requirements brought by the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the
In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR). In general, the new
regulations increase regulatory requirements and oversight, especially for
medical software, and this is also true for requirements related to
cybersecurity, which are now explicitly addressed in the legislation. The
significant legislation changes currently underway, combined with increased
cybersecurity requirements, create unique challenges for manufacturers to
comply with the regulatory framework. In this paper, we review the new
cybersecurity requirements in the light of currently available guidance
documents, and pinpoint four core concepts around which cybersecurity
compliance can be built. We argue that these core concepts form a foundations
for cybersecurity compliance in the European Union regulatory framework.

analysis of different $B$-decay channels measured by the LHCb experiment. The
results are described by a linear function of the meson transverse momentum, or
with a function inspired by Tsallis statistics. Precise measurements of the
branching fractions of the $B^0_s \to J/\psi \phi$ and $B^0_s \to D^-_s \pi^+$

respect to previous world averages. Numerous $B^0_s$ decay branching fractions,
measured at the LHCb experiment, are also updated using the new values of
$f_s/f_d$ and branching fractions of normalisation channels. These results
reduce a major source of systematic uncertainty in several searches for new
physics performed through measurements of $B^0_s$ branching fractions.

pulsar PSR B0950+08, was fitted, a decade ago, with a power law with index $1
\pm 0.01$. This was interpreted as an {\em appreciable deviation} from the,
commonly observed index of $5/3$, expected for Kolmogorov turbulence. In this
paper it is suggested that the observations are consistent with a Kolmogorov
turbulence and that the {\em apparent} deviation is due to a turbulent region
with an effective depth which is {\em comparable} to the observed lateral
scales on the plane of the sky, spanned by the pulsar beam. Alternatively, the
fitted index of $1$ is consistent with an underlying compressive turbulence and
an even {\it smaller} depth. In the first interpretation the depth is $(5.5 \pm
1.8) \times 10^8 cm$. In the second one, the depth is $\lesssim 4\times 10^7 cm
$. These estimates lend support for the existence of extremely thin, ionized
scattering screens in the local interstellar cloud, that have been proposed a
decade ago.

interactions in compactifications of type IIB string theory, and we show that
black hole superradiance excludes some regions of Calabi-Yau moduli space.
Regardless of the cosmological model, a theory with an axion whose mass falls
in a superradiant band can be probed by the measured properties of
astrophysical black holes, unless the axion self-interaction is large enough to
disrupt formation of a condensate. We study a large ensemble of
compactifications on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces, with $1 \leq h^{1,1} \leq 491$
closed string axions, and determine whether the superradiance conditions on the
masses and self-interactions are fulfilled. The axion mass spectrum is largely
determined by the K\""ahler parameters, for mild assumptions about the
contributing instantons, and takes a nearly-universal form when $h^{1,1} \gg
1$. When the K\""ahler moduli are taken at the tip of the stretched K\""ahler
cone, the fraction of geometries excluded initially grows with $h^{1,1}$, to a
maximum of $\approx 0.5$ at $h^{1,1} \approx 160$, and then falls for larger
$h^{1,1}$. Further inside the K\""ahler cone, the superradiance constraints are
far weaker, but for $h^{1,1} \gg 100$ the decay constants are so small that
these geometries may be in tension with astrophysical bounds, depending on the
realization of the Standard Model.

triangular and honeycomb obstacle arrays at zero temperature. The skyrmion Hall
angle $\theta_{sk}$, that is the angle between the applied external drive and
the direction of the skyrmion motion, increases in quantized steps or
continuously as a function of the applied drive. For the obstacle arrays
studied in this work, the skyrmion exhibits two main directional locking
effects, where the skyrmion motion locks with $\theta_{sk}=-30^\circ$ and
$-60^\circ$. We show that these directions are privileged due to the obstacle
landscape symmetry, where there are channels that the skyrmion may move with
less or no obstacle collisions. Besides that, the skyrmion Hall angles can be
modified by changing the obstacle density in the sample, where some dynamic
phases may appear, vanish or be stimulated. This interesting behavior can be

that we can address this discrepancy explicitly by learning to synthesize
realistic street views from satellite inputs. Following this observation, we
propose a novel multi-task architecture in which image synthesis and retrieval

of our knowledge, ours is the first approach that creates realistic street

freshly accelerated CRs originating from the enclosed star forming region
Cygnus OB2. Hitherto it was not known that such regions could accelerate
particles to these energies. The measured flux is likely originated by hadronic
interactions. The spectral shape and the emission profile of the Cocoon changes
from GeV to TeV energies, which reveals the transport of cosmic particles and
historical activity in the superbubble.

years after its introduction. It provides a well motivated origin for the
scalar inflaton, the ""scaleron"" with a mass of $O(10^{13})$ GeV, emerging as a
graviton degree of freedom from $R^2$ corrections to Einstein-Hilbert gravity.
However the coupling of such a heavy state to the BEH (""Higgs"") scalar is
problematic as its quantum loop corrections can induce an unacceptably large
contribution to the radiatively induced BEH scalar mass. The calculation of
these corrections is normally done by Weyl transforming to the Einstein frame,
yet at the quantum level Weyl transformations are fraught with ambiguities.
However the recent realization that there exist ""gravitational contact
interactions"" largely sidesteps these ambiguities. Such contact terms are
necessarily present, coming from t-channel graviton exchange interactions, and
they show that the theory defined in the ""Jordan Frame"" is identical to the
theory in the Einstein frame, with additional Planck-scale suppressed
interactions that take on the form of a Weyl transformation. This avoids
ambiguous nonlinear field redefinitions, and reliable loop calculations are
possible leading to a consistent low energy theory in an expansion in $1/M^2$.
Taking account of the contact terms we study the radiative corrections to the
BEH mass in the mixed Higgs/$R^2$ model with explicit scale breaking, and in an
extension of the model in which exact scale symmetry is spontaneously broken.

by exploiting electrooptic effects. The phase-shifted Bragg grating filters
have a footprint smaller than 1 {\mu}m x 1mm and operate at telecom

transmission bandwidths as narrow as 14.4 pm ($Q = 1.1$ x $10^5$) and 8.8 pm
($Q = 1.76$ x $10^5$) in critically coupled structures and multi-wavelength
Fabry-Perot configurations, respectively, in full agreement with theoretical

lithium niobate, in combination with the tight light confinement of
nanophotonic wires and the ultranarrow spectral resonances of optimized grating
structures, we demonstrate a tunability of 25.1pm/V and a record modulation of

plasma reactor in which cyclic organosilicon dust formation is observed.
Metallic (silver) atoms were injected in the plasma during the dust nucleation
phase to study their incorporation in the dust. The experiments show formation
of silver nanoparticles (~15 nm) under conditions in which organosilicon dust
of size 200 nm or less is grown. The presence of AgSiO bonds, revealed by
infrared spectroscopy, suggests the presence of junctions between the metallic
nanoparticles and the organosilicon dust. Even after annealing we could not
conclude on the formation of silver silicates, emphasizing that most of silver
is included in the metallic nanoparticles. The molecular analysis performed by
laser mass spectrometry exhibits a complex chemistry leading to a variety of
molecules including large hydrocarbons and organometallic species. The
reactivity of silver atoms/ions with acetylene was also studied in a laser
vaporization source. Key organometallic species, AgnC2Hm (n=1-3; m=0-2), were
identified and their structures and energetic data computed using density
functional theory. This allows us to propose that molecular Ag-C seeds promote
the formation of Ag clusters but also catalyze hydrocarbon growth. Throughout
the article, we show how the developed methodology can be used to characterize
the incorporation of metal atoms both in the molecular and dust phases. The
reported methodology is a demonstration laying down the ground for future

bands and for the long neck problem. In the case of bands over manifolds of
non-vanishing $\hat{\mathrm{A}}$-genus, we establish a rigidity result stating
that any band attaining the predicted upper bound is isometric to a particular
warped product over some spin manifold admitting a parallel spinor.
Furthermore, we establish scalar- and mean curvature extremality results for
certain log-concave warped products. The latter includes annuli in all
simply-connected space forms. On a technical level, our proofs are based on new
spectral estimates for the Dirac operator augmented by a Lipschitz potential
together with local boundary conditions.

reprocessing of rapidly-changing X-ray emission from a more compact region near

lags between X-ray and optical/UV emission due to differences in light travel
time. Observationally however, such lag features have been difficult to detect
due to gaps in the lightcurves introduced through factors such as source
visibility or limited telescope time. In this work, Gaussian process regression
is employed to interpolate the gaps in the Swift X-ray and UV lightcurves of
the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 335. In a simulation study of five
commonly-employed analytic Gaussian process kernels, we conclude that the
Matern 1/2 and rational quadratic kernels yield the most well-specified models
for the X-ray and UVW2 bands of Mrk 335. In analysing the structure functions
of the Gaussian process lightcurves, we obtain a broken power law with a break
point at 125 days in the UVW2 band. In the X-ray band, the structure function
of the Gaussian process lightcurve is consistent with a power law in the case
of the rational quadratic kernel whilst a broken power law with a breakpoint at
66 days is obtained from the Matern 1/2 kernel. The subsequent
cross-correlation analysis is consistent with previous studies and furthermore,
shows tentative evidence for a broad X-ray-UV lag feature of up to 30 days in
the lag-frequency spectrum where the significance of the lag depends on the
choice of Gaussian process kernel.

Cayley tree with stochastic resetting. In the case of a homogeneous tree with a
closed terminal node and no resetting, it is known that the system undergoes a
classical localization-delocalization (LD) transition at a critical mean
velocity $v_c= -(D/L)\ln (z-1)$ where $D$ is the diffusivity, $L$ is the branch
length and $z$ is the coordination number of the tree. If $v <v_c$ then the
steady state concentration at the terminal node is non-zero (drift-dominated
localized state), whereas it is zero when $v >v_c $ (diffusion-dominated
delocalized state). This is equivalent to the transition between recurrent and
transient transport on the tree, with the mean first passage time (MFPT) to be
absorbed by an open terminal node switching from a finite value to infinity.
Here we show how the LD transition provides a basic framework for understanding
analogous phase transitions in optimal resetting rates. First, we establish the
existence of an optimal resetting rate $r^{**}(z)$ that maximizes the
steady-state solution at a closed terminal node. In addition, we show that
there is a phase transition at a critical velocity $v_c^{**}(z)$ such that
$r^{**}>0$ for $v>v_c^{**}$ and $r^{**}=0$ for $v<v_c^{**}$. We then identify a
critical velocity $v^*(z)$ for a phase transition in a second optimal resetting
rate $r^*$ that minimizes the MFPT to be absorbed by an open terminal node.
Previous results for the semi-infinite line are recovered on setting $z=2$. The
critical velocity of the LD transition provides an upper bound for the other
critical velocities such that $v_c^*(z)<v_c^{**}(z)<v_c(z)$ for all finite $z$.
Only $v_c(z)$ has a simple universal dependence on the coordination number $z$.
We end by considering the combined effects of quenched disorder and stochastic
resetting.

widely used in the neuroimaging community to uncover multivariate associations
between two data modalities (e.g., brain imaging and behaviour). However, these
methods have inherent limitations: (1) statistical inferences about the
associations are often not robust; (2) the associations within each data
modality are not modelled; (3) missing values need to be imputed or removed.
Group Factor Analysis (GFA) is a hierarchical model that addresses the first
two limitations by providing Bayesian inference and modelling modality-specific
associations. Here, we propose an extension of GFA that handles missing data,
and highlight that GFA can be used as a predictive model. We applied GFA to
synthetic and real data consisting of brain connectivity and non-imaging
measures from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). In synthetic data, GFA
uncovered the underlying shared and specific factors and predicted correctly
the non-observed data modalities in complete and incomplete data sets. In the
HCP data, we identified four relevant shared factors, capturing associations
between mood, alcohol and drug use, cognition, demographics and
psychopathological measures and the default mode, frontoparietal control,
dorsal and ventral networks and insula, as well as two factors describing
associations within brain connectivity. In addition, GFA predicted a set of
non-imaging measures from brain connectivity. These findings were consistent in
complete and incomplete data sets, and replicated previous findings in the
literature. GFA is a promising tool that can be used to uncover associations
between and within multiple data modalities in benchmark datasets (such as,
HCP), and easily extended to more complex models to solve more challenging
tasks.

significant events are rare and limited to a single positive reward per

cooperate with, while a large number of partners are simply not interested in
cooperating, regardless of what the agent has to offer. We address this problem
in a continuous state and action space with two different kinds of search
methods: a gradient policy search method and a direct policy search method
using an evolution strategy. We show that when significant events are rare,
gradient information is also scarce, making it difficult for policy gradient
search methods to find an optimal policy, with or without a deep neural
architecture. On the other hand, we show that direct policy search methods are
invariant to the rarity of significant events, which is yet another
confirmation of the unique role evolutionary algorithms has to play as a
reinforcement learning method.

$k$ with $k = \log \log N + O(\sqrt{\log \log N})$ (that is, any ""popular""

exhibit a rich variety of behavior in their entanglement scaling with subsystem
size -- from logarithmic to extensive to \emph{fractal}. We show how these
outcomes in non-unitary circuits (that are ""spacetime-dual"" to unitary
circuits) relate to the growth of entanglement in time in the corresponding
unitary circuits, and how they differ, through an exact mapping to a problem of
unitary evolution with boundary decoherence, in which information gets
""radiated away"" from one edge of the system. In spacetime-duals of chaotic
unitary circuits, this mapping allows us to uncover a non-thermal volume-law
entangled phase with a logarithmic correction to the entropy distinct from
other known examples. Most notably, we also find novel steady state phases with
\emph{fractal} entanglement scaling, $S(\ell) \sim \ell^{\alpha}$ with tunable
$0 < \alpha < 1$ for subsystems of size $\ell$ in one dimension. These
fractally entangled states add a qualitatively new entry to the families of
many-body quantum states that have been studied as energy eigenstates or
dynamical steady states, whose entropy almost always displays either area-law,
volume-law or logarithmic scaling. We also present an experimental protocol for
preparing these novel steady states with only a very limited amount of
postselection via a type of ""teleportation"" between spacelike and timelike

representations that capture essential features of the inputs. However, these
representations are poorly understood in theory and practice. In the context of
supervised learning an important question is whether these representations
capture features informative for classification, while filtering out
non-informative noisy ones. We explore a formalization of this question by
considering a generative process where each class is associated with a
high-dimensional manifold and different classes define different manifolds.
Under this model, each input is produced using two latent vectors: (i) a
""manifold identifier"" $\gamma$ and; (ii)~a ""transformation parameter"" $\theta$
that shifts examples along the surface of a manifold. E.g., $\gamma$ might
represent a canonical image of a dog, and $\theta$ might stand for variations
in pose, background or lighting. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence
that neural representations can be viewed as LSH-like functions that map each
input to an embedding that is a function of solely the informative $\gamma$ and
invariant to $\theta$, effectively recovering the manifold identifier $\gamma$.
An important consequence of this behavior is one-shot learning to unseen

Example scaling strategies may include increasing model width, depth,

accuracy and flops (floating point operations). Yet, as we demonstrate, various
scaling strategies affect model parameters, activations, and consequently
actual runtime quite differently. In our experiments we show the surprising
result that numerous scaling strategies yield networks with similar accuracy
but with widely varying properties. This leads us to propose a simple fast
compound scaling strategy that encourages primarily scaling model width, while
scaling depth and resolution to a lesser extent. Unlike currently popular
scaling strategies, which result in about $O(s)$ increase in model activation
w.r.t. scaling flops by a factor of $s$, the proposed fast compound scaling
results in close to $O(\sqrt{s})$ increase in activations, while achieving
excellent accuracy. This leads to comparable speedups on modern memory-limited

far-reaching consequences for the Majorana physics, but is intrinsically
difficult to probe experimentally in a hybrid structure, providing a
quantitative theoretical description of disorder effects becomes essential. To
accomplish this task, we develop a microscopic theory that (i) provides a
quantitative characterization of the effective potential generated by a charge
impurity embedded inside a semiconductor wire proximity-coupled to a
superconductor layer by solving self-consistently the associated
three-dimensional Schr\""odinger-Poisson problem, (ii) describes the low-energy

spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman splitting, and disorder arising from multiple

approach, and (iii) links the microscopic results to experimentally observable
features by generating tunneling differential conductance maps as function of

that charge impurities lead to serious complications regarding the realization

singlet-doublet fermion DM, there is a spin dependent scattering process next
to the spin independent one, which significantly boosts the event rate and thus
makes indirect detection competitive with respect to the direct detection
limits imposed by PICO-60. Due to a correlation between both scattering
processes, the limits on the spin independent cross section set by XENON1T

dispersion ratio of $v_\phi/\sigma_r \simeq 5$ for the total gas. It forms as a
result of a period of intense accretion of co-planar, co-rotating gas via cold
cosmic-web streams. This thin disc survives for $\sim 5$ orbital periods, after
which it is disrupted by mergers and counter-rotating streams, longer but
consistent with our estimate that a galaxy of this mass

sensitive to the tracer used to perform the kinematic analysis. While it is
$v_\phi/\sigma_r \simeq 3.5$ for atomic HI gas, it is $v_\phi/\sigma_r \simeq

to cold, dense clouds that reside near the disc mid-plane, while the atomic gas

mechanisms is a theoretical proposal that has not been validated yet with
proper statistical measurements and it remains unclear whether it occurs

lower in more massive halos. Hot outflows have $2-5\times$ higher specific

indeed, in dwarfs, the mass, momentum, and metal outflow rates increase with
radius whereas energy is roughly conserved, indicating swept up halo gas.

theories. Regularized boundary states are dual to end of the world branes in an
AdS black hole via the AdS/BCFT. Thus they can be regarded as microstates of a
single sided black hole. Owing to the open-closed duality, such an overlap
between two different regularized boundary states is exponentially suppressed
as $\langle \psi_{a} | \psi_{b} \rangle \sim e^{-O(h^{(min)}_{ab})}$, where
$h^{(min)}_{ab}$ is the lowest energy of open strings which connect two
different boundaries $a$ and $b$. Our gravity dual analysis leads to
$h^{(min)}_{ab} = c/24$ for a pure AdS$_3$ gravity. This shows that a
holographic boundary state is a random vector among all left-right symmetric
states, whose number is given by a square root of the number of all black hole
microstates. We also perform a similar computation in higher dimensions, and
find that $h^{( min)}_{ab}$ depends on the tensions of the branes. In our
analysis of holographic boundary states, the off diagonal elements of the inner
products can be computed directly from on-shell gravity actions, as opposed to
earlier calculations of inner products of microstates in two dimensional
gravity.

the particles accelerated by an AGN jet. Our work is motivated by the need for
local powerful ultrahigh energy cosmic ray (UHECR) sources and evidence for
variability in AGN and radio galaxies. Our main results are: i) UHECR and
nonthermal radiative luminosities track the jet power but with a response set
by the escape and cooling times, respectively; ii) jet variability produces
structure in the electron, synchrotron and UHECR spectra that deviates from
that produced for a constant jet power - in particular, spectral hardening
features may be signatures of variability; iii) the cutoff in the integrated CR
spectrum is stretched out due to the variation in jet power (and, consequently,
maximum CR energy). The resulting spectrum is the convolution of the jet power
distribution and the source term. We derive an approximate form for a
log-normal distribution of powers; iv) we introduce the idea of $\sim 10$ GeV
'proxy electrons' that are cooling at the same rate that UHECRs of rigidity 10
EV are escaping from the source, and determine the corresponding photon
frequencies that probe escaping UHECRs. Our results demonstrate the link

information on the physics of fast SMBH growth in the early universe. We
present the results of follow-up observations of the $z=6.515$ radio-quiet QSO
PSO167-13, which is interacting with a close companion galaxy. The PSO167-13
system has been recently proposed to host the first heavily obscured X-ray
source at high redshift. We observed PSO167-13 with Chandra/ACIS-S (177 ks),
and obtained new spectroscopic observations (7.2 h) with Magellan/FIRE. No
significant X-ray emission is detected from the PSO167-13 system, suggesting
that the obscured X-ray source previously tentatively detected was either due
to a strong background fluctuation or is highly variable. The upper limit (90%
confidence level) on the X-ray emission of PSO167-13
($L_{2-10\,\mathrm{keV}}<8.3\times10^{43}\,\mathrm{erg s^{-1}}$) is the lowest
available for a $z>6$ QSO. The ratio between the X-ray and UV luminosity of
$\alpha_{ox}<-1.95$ makes PSO167-13 a strong outlier from the
$\alpha_{ox}-L_{UV}$ and $L_X-L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ relations. In particular, its
X-ray emission is $>6$ times weaker than the expectation based on its UV
luminosity. The new Magellan/FIRE spectrum of PSO167-13 is strongly affected by
the unfavorable sky conditions, but the tentatively detected C IV and Mg II
emission lines appear strongly blueshifted. The most plausible explanations for
the X-ray weakness of PSO167-13 are intrinsic weakness or small-scale
absorption by Compton-thick material. The possible strong blueshift of its
emission lines hints at the presence of nuclear winds, which could be related
to its X-ray weakness.

of human image generation such as global appearance sampling, pose transfer,
parts and garment transfer, and parts sampling jointly in a unified framework.
As our model encodes part-based latent appearance vectors in a normalized
pose-independent space and warps them to different poses, it preserves body and
clothing appearance under varying posture. Experiments show that our flexible

pose-conditioned image generation, pose transfer and part sampling in terms of

different ways that news can create value for the reader, building from
theories and empirical research in journalism and user engagement. Using
theories and empirical research from communication on the uses and

consists of information the user needs to know, and 2) serendipity, which are
the articles offering unexpected surprises. The diversity of the articles
according to the defined strata and the order of the articles within the list

Recently, higher dimensional qudits - in particular, qutrits - have gained

non-trivial step towards the simplification of qutrit quantum circuits. We then
give further unexpected areas in which these rewrite strategies provide

the event arguments. To remedy this limitation, we introduce a general approach
to learning a representation of the event names along with their arguments

most neural networks and is task-agnostic. The benefit is quantified by
conducting an ablation study on three groups of arguments: call-related,
process-related, and time-related. Experiments were conducted on a novel web

tasks. Such tasks may be used to detect anomalies, pre-train neural networks to
improve their performance, and extract a contextual representation of the

  Models","Accepted by NAACL 2021",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent studies indicate that NLU models are prone to rely on shortcut
features for prediction, without achieving true language understanding. As a
result, these models fail to generalize to real-world out-of-distribution data.
In this work, we show that the words in the NLU training set can be modeled as
a long-tailed distribution. There are two findings: 1) NLU models have strong
preference for features located at the head of the long-tailed distribution,
and 2) Shortcut features are picked up during very early few iterations of the
model training. These two observations are further employed to formulate a
measurement which can quantify the shortcut degree of each training sample.
Based on this shortcut measurement, we propose a shortcut mitigation framework
LTGR, to suppress the model from making overconfident predictions for samples
with large shortcut degree. Experimental results on three NLU benchmarks
demonstrate that our long-tailed distribution explanation accurately reflects
the shortcut learning behavior of NLU models. Experimental analysis further
indicates that LTGR can improve the generalization accuracy on OOD data, while
preserving the accuracy on in-distribution data.

fundamental tradeoff between the two sources of error involved: approximation
and estimation. While the former needs the NN class to be rich and expressive,
the latter relies on controlling complexity. This paper explores this tradeoff
by means of non-asymptotic error bounds, focusing on three popular choices of
SDs -- Kullback-Leibler divergence, chi-squared divergence, and squared

value that an anaphor eventually conveys is co-specified by the value of its
antecedent. Interestingly, when occurring in a given syntactic position,
different anaphors may have different sets of admissible antecedents. Such
differences are the basis for the categorization of anaphoric expressions
according to their anaphoric capacity, being important to determine what are
the sets of admissible antecedents and how to represent and process this
anaphoric capacity for each type of anaphor.
  From an empirical perspective, these constraints stem from what appears as
quite cogent generalisations and exhibit a universal character, given their
cross linguistic validity. From a conceptual point of view, in turn, the
relations among binding constraints involve non-trivial cross symmetry, which
lends them a modular nature and provides further strength to the plausibility
of their universal character. This kind of anaphoric binding constraints
appears thus as a most significant subset of natural language knowledge,
usually referred to as binding theory.
  This paper provides an integrated overview of these constraints holding on
the pairing of nominal anaphors with their admissible antecedents that are
based on grammatical relations and structure. Along with the increasing
interest on neuro-symbolic approaches to natural language, this paper seeks to
contribute to revive the interest on this most intriguing research topic.

asymptotics, where the isometry group coming from the sphere factor is broken
down to SO($q$). Depending on the values of $p$ and $q$, these are solutions to
a certain Supergravity theory with a particular gauge field. We have considered
the values $(p,q) = (5,5)$ and $(p,q) = (4,7)$, corresponding to type IIB
supergravity in ten dimensions and eleven-dimensional supergravity
respectively. These theories presumably contain an infinite spectrum of
families of lumpy black holes, labeled by a harmonic number $\ell$, whose
endpoints in solution space merge with another type of black holes with
different horizon topology. We have numerically constructed the first four
families of lumpy solutions, corresponding to $\ell = 1, 2^+, 2^-$ and $3$. We
show that the geometry of the horizon near the merger is well-described by a
cone over a triple product of spheres, thus extending Kol's local model to the
present asymptotics. Interestingly, the presence of non-trivial fluxes in the
internal sphere implies that the cone is no longer Ricci flat. This conical
manifold accounts for the geometry and the behavior of the physical quantities
of the solutions sufficiently close to the critical point. Additionally, we
show that the vacuum expectation values of the dual scalar operators approach
their critical values with a power law whose exponents are dictated by the
local cone geometry in the bulk.

predictions for stochastic gravitational wave signals at future detectors and
such predictions are used to delineate portions of the model parameter space
that can be constrained. The question is: how precise are such predictions?
Uncertainties enter in the calculation of the macroscopic thermal parameters
and the dynamics of the phase transition itself. We calculate such
uncertainties with increasing levels of sophistication in treating the phase
transition dynamics. Currently, the highest level of diligence corresponds to
careful treatments of the source lifetime; mean bubble separation; going beyond
the bag model approximation in solving the hydrodynamics equations and
explicitly calculating the fraction of energy in the fluid from these equations
rather than using a fit; and including fits for the energy lost to vorticity
modes and reheating effects. The lowest level of diligence incorporates none of
these effects. We compute the percolation and nucleation temperatures, the mean
bubble separation, the fluid velocity, and ultimately the gravitational wave
spectrum corresponding to the level of highest diligence for three explicit
examples: SMEFT, a dark sector Higgs model, and the real singlet-extended
Standard Model (xSM). In each model, we contrast different levels of diligence
in the calculation and find that the difference in the final predicted signal
can be several orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that calculating the
gravitational wave spectrum for particle physics models and deducing precise
constraints on the parameter space of such models continues to remain very much
a work in progress and warrants care.

game changing advantage in defending systems against malware. However, HMDs
suffer from adversarial attacks, can be effectively reverse-engineered and
subsequently be evaded, allowing malware to hide from detection. We address
this issue by proposing a novel HMDs (Stochastic-HMDs) through approximate
computing, which makes HMDs' inference computation-stochastic, thereby making
HMDs resilient against adversarial evasion attacks. Specifically, we propose to
leverage voltage overscaling to induce stochastic computation in the HMDs
model. We show that such a technique makes HMDs more resilient to both
black-box adversarial attack scenarios, i.e., reverse-engineering and
transferability. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stochastic-HMDs
offer effective defense against adversarial attacks along with by-product power
savings, without requiring any changes to the hardware/software nor to the
HMDs' model, i.e., no retraining or fine tuning is needed. Moreover, based on
recent results in probably approximately correct (PAC) learnability theory, we
show that Stochastic-HMDs are provably more difficult to reverse engineer.

partially aligned along the direction of the interstellar magnetic field.
Numerous alignment theories have been proposed, all of which examine the grain
rotational dynamics. In 1999, Lazarian & Draine introduced the important
concept of thermal flipping, in which internal relaxation processes induce the
grain body to flip while its angular momentum remains fixed. Through detailed
numerical simulations, we study the role of thermal flipping on the grain
dynamics during periods of relatively slow rotation, known as `crossovers', for
the special case of a spheroidal grain with a non-uniform mass distribution.
Lazarian & Draine proposed that rapid flipping during a crossover would lead to
`thermal trapping', in which a systematic torque, fixed relative to the grain
body, would time average to zero, delaying spin-up to larger rotational speeds.
We find that the time-averaged systematic torque is not zero during the
crossover and that thermal trapping is not prevalent. As an application, we
examine whether the classic Davis-Greenstein alignment mechanism is viable, for
grains residing in the cold neutral medium and lacking superparamagnetic
inclusions. We find that Davis-Greenstein alignment is not hindered by thermal
trapping, but argue that it is, nevertheless, too inefficient to yield the
alignment of large grains responsible for optical and infrared starlight
polarization. Davis-Greenstein alignment of small grains could potentially
contribute to the observed ultraviolet polarization. The theoretical and
computational tools developed here can also be applied to analyses of alignment
via radiative torques and rotational disruption of grains.

scientific and industrial communities aim at making the impact of drones even
more disruptive by empowering collaborative autonomous behaviors -- also known

3D mapping missions, unmanned aerial vehicles typically collect the aerial

in a centralized manner. However, such approaches do not leverage computational

emergency response application through the exploitation of a swarm-powered ad
hoc cloud. Producing the relevant 3D maps in a timely manner, even when the

heuristic based on decomposition and a variable neighborhood search heuristic
to minimize the completion time of the 3D reconstruction process necessary in

chaotic, asynchronous fluctuations. In previous work, we showed that when
endowed with an additional low-rank connectivity consisting of the outer
product of orthogonal vectors, these networks generate large-scale coherent
fluctuations. Although a striking phenomenon, that result depended on a
fine-tuned choice of low-rank structure. Here we extend that work by
generalizing the theory of excitation-inhibition balance to networks with
arbitrary low-rank structure and show that low-dimensional variability emerges
intrinsically through what we call incomplete recurrent alignment. We say that
a low-rank connectivity structure exhibits incomplete alignment if its
row-space is not contained in its column-space. In the setting of incomplete
alignment, recurrent connectivity can be decomposed into a subspace-recurrent
component and an effective-feedforward component. We show that
high-dimensional, microscopic fluctuations are propagated via the
effective-feedforward component to a low-dimensional subspace where they are
dynamically balanced by macroscopic fluctuations. We present biologically
plausible examples from excitation-inhibition networks and networks with
heterogeneous degree distributions. Finally, we define the alignment matrix as
the overlap between left and right-singular vectors of the structured
connectivity, and show that the singular values of the alignment matrix
determine the amplitude of macroscopic variability, while its singular vectors
determine the structure. Our work shows how macroscopic fluctuations can emerge
generically in strongly-coupled networks with low-rank structure. Furthermore,
by generalizing excitation-inhibition balance to arbitrary low-rank structure
our work may find relevance in any setting with strongly interacting units,

We now treat the Sun as an extended body with a gravitational field that can be

the propagation of monochromatic EM waves in this extended solar gravitational

the caustics formed in an image plane in the SGL's strong interference region.
We investigate the EM field in several important regions, namely i) the area in
the inner part of the caustic and close to the optical axis, ii) the region
outside the caustic, and iii) the region in the immediate vicinity of the
caustic, especially around its cusps and folds. We show that in the first two
regions the physical behavior of the EM field may be understood using the
method of stationary phase. However, in the immediate vicinity of the caustic
the method of stationary phase is inadequate and a wave-optical treatment is
necessary. Relying on the angular eikonal method, we develop a new approach to
describe the EM field accurately in all regions, including the immediate
vicinity of the caustics and especially near the cusps and folds. The method
allows us to investigate the EM field in this important region, which is

and exposing the critical role of local politics in crisis response. In the
United States, there has been a strong partisan divide between the Democratic

polarization of individual behaviors and divergent policy adoption across
regions. As shown in this case, as well as in most major social issues,
strongly polarized narrative frameworks facilitate such narratives. To
understand polarization and other social chasms, it is critical to dissect
these diverging narratives. Here, taking the Democratic and Republican
political social media posts about the pandemic as a case study, we demonstrate
that a combination of computational methods can provide useful insights into
the different contexts, framing, and characters and relationships that
construct their narrative frameworks which individual posts source from.
Leveraging a dataset of tweets from elite politicians in the U.S., we found
that the Democrats' narrative tends to be more concerned with the pandemic as
well as financial and social support, while the Republicans discuss more about
other political entities such as China. We then perform an automatic framing
analysis to characterize the ways in which they frame their narratives, where
we found that the Democrats emphasize the government's role in responding to
the pandemic, and the Republicans emphasize the roles of individuals and
support for small businesses. Finally, we present a semantic role analysis that
uncovers the important characters and relationships in their narratives as well
as how they facilitate a membership categorization process. Our findings
concretely expose the gaps in the ""elusive consensus"" between the two parties.

homogeneous air turbulence. The regimes are relevant to the airborne transport
of dust and droplets: the Taylor-microscale Reynolds number is Re = 289 - 462,
the Kolmogorov-scale Stokes number is St = 1.2 - 13, and the Kolmogorov
acceleration is comparable to the gravitational acceleration (i.e., the Froude
number Fr = O(1)). We use high-speed laser imaging to track the particles and
simultaneously characterize the air velocity field, resolving all relevant
spatio-temporal scales. The role of the flow sampled by the particles is
spotlighted. In the present range of parameters, the particle settling velocity
is enhanced proportionally to the velocity scale of the turbulence. Both
gravity and inertia reduce the velocity fluctuations of the particles compared
to the fluid; while they have competing effect on the particle acceleration,
through the crossing trajectories and inertial filtering mechanisms,
respectively. The preferential sampling of high-strain/low-vorticity regions is
measurable, but its impact on the global statistics is moderate. The inertial
particles have large relative velocity at small separations, which increases
their pair dispersion; however, gravity offsets this effect by causing them to
experience fluid velocities that decorrelate faster in time compared to
tracers. Based on the observations, we derive an analytical model to predict
the particle velocity and acceleration variances for arbitrary St, Fr, and Re.
This agrees well with the present observations and previous simulations and
captures the respective effects of inertia and gravity, both of which play
crucial roles in the transport.

Learning. First, in the semi-heterogeneous setting, when the marginal
distributions of the feature vectors on client machines are identical, we
develop the federated functional gradient boosting (FFGB) method that provably
converges to the global minimum. Subsequently, we extend our results to the
fully-heterogeneous setting (where marginal distributions of feature vectors
may differ) by designing an efficient variant of FFGB called FFGB.C, with
provable convergence to a neighborhood of the global minimum within a radius
that depends on the total variation distances between the client feature
distributions. For the special case of square loss, but still in the fully
heterogeneous setting, we design the FFGB.L method that also enjoys provable
convergence to a neighborhood of the global minimum but within a radius
depending on the much tighter Wasserstein-1 distances. For both FFGB.C and
FFGB.L, the radii of convergence shrink to zero as the feature distributions
become more homogeneous. Finally, we conduct proof-of-concept experiments to
demonstrate the benefits of our approach against natural baselines.

explicitly by studying gravitational solutions with non-zero cosmological

density filling all space in the gauge theory that has been observed in
previous works is a consequence of this curvature term. As an example of a
solution with a curved background, we study the Lifshitz black hole with two
different matter couplings. The curvature of the background, i.e., the Lifshitz
spacetime, again yields a constant charge density; however, unlike the previous
examples, it is canceled by the contribution from the matter fields. For one of
the matter couplings, there remains no additional non-localized source term,

two-way communication channels between individual robots and remote human
operators for supervision and tasking. Existing open-source solutions to this
problem degrade in performance in challenging real-world situations such as
intermittent and low-bandwidth connectivity, do not provide security control
options, and can be computationally expensive on hardware-constrained mobile
robot platforms. In this paper, we present Robofleet, a lightweight open-source
system which provides inter-robot communication, remote monitoring, and remote
tasking for a fleet of ROS-enabled service-mobile robots that is designed with
the practical goals of resilience to network variance and security control in
mind.
  Robofleet supports multi-user, multi-robot communication via a central
server. This architecture deduplicates network traffic between robots,
significantly reducing overall network load when compared with native ROS
communication. This server also functions as a single entrypoint into the
system, enabling security control and user authentication. Individual robots
run the lightweight Robofleet client, which is responsible for exchanging
messages with the Robofleet server. It automatically adapts to adverse network
conditions through backpressure monitoring as well as topic-level priority
control, ensuring that safety-critical messages are successfully transmitted.
Finally, the system includes a web-based visualization tool that can be run on
any internet-connected, browser-enabled device to monitor and control the
fleet.
  We compare Robofleet to existing methods of robotic communication, and
demonstrate that it provides superior resilience to network variance while
maintaining performance that exceeds that of widely-used systems.

algorithms of significant practical importance. In this work, we propose a
highly effective use of the surface-GKP code, i.e., the surface code consisting
of bosonic GKP qubits instead of bare two-dimensional qubits. In our proposal,
we use error-corrected two-qubit gates between GKP qubits and introduce a
maximum likelihood decoding strategy for correcting shift errors in the
two-GKP-qubit gates. Our proposed decoding reduces the total CNOT failure rate
of the GKP qubits, e.g., from $0.87\%$ to $0.36\%$ at a GKP squeezing of
$12$dB, compared to the case where the simple closest-integer decoding is used.
Then, by concatenating the GKP code with the surface code, we find that the
threshold GKP squeezing is given by $9.9$dB under the the assumption that
finite-squeezing of the GKP states is the dominant noise source. More
importantly, we show that a low logical failure rate $p_{L} < 10^{-7}$ can be
achieved with moderate hardware requirements, e.g., $291$ modes and $97$ qubits
at a GKP squeezing of $12$dB as opposed to $1457$ bare qubits for the standard
rotated surface code at an equivalent noise level (i.e., $p=0.36\%$). Such a
low failure rate of our surface-GKP code is possible through the use of
space-time correlated edges in the matching graphs of the surface code decoder.
Further, all edge weights in the matching graphs are computed dynamically based
on analog information from the GKP error correction using the full history of
all syndrome measurement rounds. We also show that a highly-squeezed GKP state
of GKP squeezing $\gtrsim 12$dB can be experimentally realized by using a
dissipative stabilization method, namely, the Big-small-Big method, with fairly
conservative experimental parameters. Lastly, we introduce a three-level
ancilla scheme to mitigate ancilla decay errors during a GKP state preparation.

measurements of HI 21cm emission with $HST$ and ground-based optical and
near-infrared images allows multiple distance measurements for 19 galaxies and
single measurements for the remaining 5. Separation of the nucleus from its
host galaxy via surface brightness decomposition yields galaxy-only
luminosities, thus allowing measurements of the distance moduli free of
contamination from the AGN. For 14 AGN hosts, these are the first reported
distances independent of redshift, and hence independent of peculiar
velocities. For the remaining galaxies, we show good agreement between our
distances and those previously reported from surface brightness fluctuations
(SBF) and Cepheids. We also determine the total galaxy mass enclosed within the
estimated HI radius, which when compared to the baryonic content allows for
constraints on the dark matter masses. We find a typical mass fraction of
$M_{\textrm{DM}}$/$M_{\textrm{DYN}}$ = 62\%, and find significant correlations
between $M_{\textrm{BH}}$ $-$ $M_{\textrm{DYN}}$ and $M_{\textrm{BH}}$ $-$

rate limitations in underwater acoustic (UWA) channels. Because of transmission
at the same time and on the same frequency band, the signal from the local
transmitter creates self-interference (SI) that contaminates the signal from
the remote transmitter. At the local receiver, channel state information for
both the SI and remote channels is required to remove the SI and equalize the
SI-free signal, respectively. However, because of the rapid time-variations of
the UWA environment, real-time tracking of the channels is necessary. In this
paper, we propose a receiver for UWA-FD communication in which the variations
of the SI and remote channels are jointly tracked by using a recursive least
squares (RLS) algorithm fed by feedback from the previously detected data
symbols. Because of the joint channel estimation, SI cancellation is more
successful compared to UWA-FD receivers with separate channel estimators. In
addition, due to providing a real-time channel tracking without the need for
frequent training sequences, the bandwidth efficiency is preserved in the
proposed receiver.

key aspects of test suites, such as their coverage of production code, is

distribution of unit tests in Open Source Software (OSS) systems through the
visualization of data obtained from both dynamic and static analysis. Our
long-term aim is to support developers in their understanding of test
distribution and the relationship of tests to production code. We first obtain
dynamic coupling information from five selected OSS systems and we then map the
test and production code results. The mapping is shown in graphs that depict
both the dependencies between classes and static test information. We analyze
these graphs using Centrality metrics derived from graph theory and SNA. Our
findings suggest that, for these five systems at least, unit test and dynamic
coupling information 'do not match', in that unit tests do not appear to be
distributed in line with the systems' dynamic coupling. We contend that, by
mapping dynamic coupling data onto unit test information, and through the use
of software metrics and visualization, we can locate central system classes and
identify to which classes unit testing effort has (or has not) been dedicated.

First, we build a hybrid mental state parser that extracts information from
both the dialogue and event observations and maintains a graphical
representation of the agent's mind; Meanwhile, the transformer-based value
model learns human preferences from the human value dataset, ValueNet.
Empirical results show that the proposed model attains state-of-the-art
performance on the dialogue/action/emotion prediction task in the fantasy
text-adventure game dataset, LIGHT. We also show example cases to demonstrate:
(i) how the proposed mental state parser can assist the agent's decision by
grounding on the context like locations and objects, and (ii) how the value

evolution in temporal graphs from the perspective of learning equivariant

cast into two distinct frameworks: (a) The most popular approach, which we
denote as time-and-graph, where equivariant graph (e.g., GNN) and sequence
(e.g., RNN) representations are intertwined to represent the temporal evolution
of node attributes in the graph; and (b) an approach that we denote as
time-then-graph, where the sequences describing the node and edge dynamics are
represented first, then fed as node and edge attributes into a static
equivariant graph representation that comes after. Interestingly, we show that
time-then-graph representations have an expressivity advantage over
time-and-graph representations when both use component GNNs that are not
most-expressive (e.g., 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman GNNs). Moreover, while our goal is
not necessarily to obtain state-of-the-art results, our experiments show that

by choosing the pairs from multiple face detectors during the training, and
generalize to a wide range of face detectors during the testing. On WiderFace,
we achieve the highest AP on the single-scale, and our AP is competitive with
the previous multi-scale methods while being significantly faster. On 8K

interleaves the studies of multiple topics, which increases long-term retention

this learning methodology is beneficial for improving the performance of
machine learning models as well. We propose a novel machine learning framework

collaboratively learn a data encoder in an interleaving fashion: the encoder is
trained by model 1 for a while, then passed to model 2 for further training,
then model 3, and so on; after trained by all models, the encoder returns back
to model 1 and is trained again, then moving to model 2, 3, etc. This process
repeats for multiple rounds. Our framework is based on multi-level optimization
consisting of multiple inter-connected learning stages. An efficient
gradient-based algorithm is developed to solve the multi-level optimization
problem. We apply interleaving learning to search neural architectures for
image classification on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The effectiveness of
our method is strongly demonstrated by the experimental results.

be estimated from $n$ independent samples of the (noisy) observations $y =

\mathrm{noise}$. The max-linear model vastly generalizes the conventional
linear model, and it can approximate any convex function to an arbitrary
accuracy when the number of linear models $k$ is large enough. However, the
inherent nonlinearity of the max-linear model renders the estimation of the
regression parameters computationally challenging. Particularly, no estimator
based on convex programming is known in the literature. We formulate and
analyze a scalable convex program as the estimator for the max-linear
regression problem. Under the standard Gaussian observation setting, we present
a non-asymptotic performance guarantee showing that the convex program recovers
the parameters with high probability. When the $k$ linear components are
equally likely to achieve the maximum, our result shows that a sufficient
number of observations scales as $k^{2}p$ up to a logarithmic factor. This
significantly improves on the analogous prior result based on alternating
minimization (Ghosh et al., 2019). Finally, through a set of Monte Carlo
simulations, we illustrate that our theoretical result is consistent with
empirical behavior, and the convex estimator for max-linear regression is as
competitive as the alternating minimization algorithm in practice.

monomer number of subcomponent $m$ is asymptotic to a value $\nu$
(approximately 0.588 in good solvents) with a correction of $m^{-0.47}$, which

quantitative agreement with the simulation result that the effective exponent

also changes significantly with T_eff. Horizontal transport-induced quenching
is very effective in our simulated exo-Neptune atmospheres, acting to
homogenize the vertical profiles of species abundances with longitude at
stratospheric pressures where infrared observations are sensitive. Our models
have important implications for planetary emission observations as a function
of orbital phase with the Ariel mission. Cooler solar-composition exo-Neptunes
with T_eff = 500-700 K are predicted to have small variations in infrared
emission spectra with orbital phase, making them less robust phase-curve
targets for Ariel. Hot solar-composition exo-Neptunes with T_eff > 1300 K
exhibit strong variations in infrared emission with orbital phase but are
arguably less interesting from an atmospheric chemistry standpoint, with
spectral signatures being dominated by a small number of species whose
abundances are expected to be constant with longitude and consistent with
thermochemical equilibrium. Solar-composition exo-Neptunes with T_eff =
900-1100 K reside in an interesting intermediate regime, with infrared phase
curve variations being affected by both temperature and composition variations.
This interesting intermediate regime shifts to smaller temperatures as

way. When the agent executes its motion, how does one verify the claim? The
problem arises in a range of contexts including in validating safety claims

the conception and the (physical) design and logistics of scientific
experiments. Given a set of feasible sensors to select from, we ask how to
choose sensors optimally in order to ensure that the agent's execution does
indeed fit its pre-disclosed itinerary. Our treatment is distinguished from
prior work in sensor selection by two aspects: the form the itinerary takes (a
regular language of transitions) and that families of sensor choices can be
grouped as a single choice. Both are intimately tied together, permitting
construction of a product automaton because the same physical sensors (i.e.,
the same choice) can appear multiple times. This paper establishes the hardness
of sensor selection for itinerary validation within this treatment, and
proposes an exact algorithm based on an ILP formulation that is capable of
solving problem instances of moderate size. We demonstrate its efficacy on
small-scale case studies, including one motivated by wildlife tracking.

to spatially apart habitat(s) has recently been considered for fisheries stock
management in the natural environment. However, its mathematical optimization,
especially finding when and how much of the population should be transported,
is still a fundamental unresolved issue. We propose a new impulse control
framework to tackle this issue based on a simple but new stochastic growth
model of individual fishes. The novel growth model governing individuals' body
weights uses a Wright-Fisher model as a latent driver to reproduce plausible
growth dynamics. The optimization problem is formulated as an impulse control
problem of a cost-benefit functional constrained by a degenerate parabolic
Fokker-Planck equation of the stochastic growth dynamics. Because the growth
dynamics have an observable variable and an unobservable variable (a variable
difficult or impossible to observe), we consider both full-information and
partial-information cases. The latter is more involved but more realistic
because of not explicitly using the unobservable variable in designing the
controls. In both cases, resolving an optimization problem reduces to solving
the associated Fokker-Planck and its adjoint equations, the latter being
non-trivial. We present a derivation procedure of the adjoint equation and its
internal boundary conditions in time to efficiently derive the optimal
transporting strategy. We finally provide a demonstrative computational example
of a transporting problem of Ayu sweetfish (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis)

implemented Hamiltonians, how well can one use that hardware to sample from a
Hamiltonian outside that family? A common approach is to minor embed the
desired Hamiltonian in a native Hamiltonian. In Phys. Rev. Research 2, 023020
(2020) it was shown that minor embedding can be detrimental for classical
thermal sampling. Here, we generalize these results by considering quantum
thermal sampling in the transverse-field Ising model, i.e. sampling a
Hamiltonian with non-zero off diagonal terms. To study these systems
numerically we introduce a modification to standard cluster update quantum
Monte-Carlo (QMC) techniques, which allows us to much more efficiently obtain
thermal samples of an embedded Hamiltonian, enabling us to simulate systems of
much larger sizes and larger transverse-field strengths than would otherwise be
possible. Our numerics focus on models that can be implemented on current
quantum devices using planar two-dimensional lattices, which exhibit
finite-temperature quantum phase transitions. Our results include: i) An
estimate on the probability to sample the logical subspace directly as a
function of transverse-field, temperature, and total system size, which agrees
with QMC simulations. ii) We show that typically measured observables (diagonal
energy and magnetization) are biased by the embedding process, in the regime of
intermediate transverse field strength, meaning that the extracted values are
not the same as in the native model. iii) By considering individual embedding
realizations akin to 'realizations of disorder', we provide numerical evidence
suggesting that as the embedding size is increased, the critical point shifts
to increasingly large values of the transverse-field.

This paper presents Reptile, an explanation system for hierarchical data. Given
an anomalous aggregate query result, Reptile recommends the next drill-down
attribute,and ranks the drill-down groups based on the extent repairing the
group's statistics to its expected values resolves the anomaly. Reptile
efficiently trains a multi-level model that leverages the data's hierarchy to
estimate the expected values, and uses a factorised representation of the
feature matrix to remove redundancies due to the data's hierarchical structure.
We further extend model training to support factorised data, and develop a
suite of optimizations that leverage the data's hierarchical structure. Reptile

crystal, where the measured timescale was below the measuring limit of the
blocking measurements < 1 as. Hence, inclusion of the Coulomb fission in the
data analysis of the blocking experiments leads us to interpret that the
measured time longer than a few attoseconds (about 2-2.5 as) is nothing but
belonging to the Coulomb fission timescale and shorter than 1 as are due to the
quasifission. Consequently, this finding resolves the critical discrepancies
between the fission timescale measurements using the nuclear and blocking
techniques. This, in turn, validates the fact that the quasifission timescale
is indeed of the order of zeptoseconds in accordance with the nuclear
experiments and theories. It thus provides a radical input in understanding the
reaction mechanism for heavy element formation via fusion evaporation processes

that our personalized learning models can achieve better accuracy and faster

  Australia?",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: To prevent future outbreaks of COVID-19, Australia is pursuing a
mass-vaccination approach in which a targeted group of the population
comprising healthcare workers, aged-care residents and other individuals at
increased risk of exposure will receive a highly effective priority vaccine.
The rest of the population will instead have access to a less effective
vaccine.
  Methods: We apply a large-scale agent-based model of COVID-19 in Australia to
investigate the possible implications of this hybrid approach to
mass-vaccination. The model is calibrated to recent epidemiological and
demographic data available in Australia, and accounts for several components of
vaccine efficacy.
  Findings: Within a feasible range of vaccine efficacy values, our model
supports the assertion that complete herd immunity due to vaccination is not
likely in the Australian context. For realistic scenarios in which herd
immunity is not achieved, we simulate the effects of mass-vaccination on
epidemic growth rate, and investigate the requirements of lockdown measures
applied to curb subsequent outbreaks. In our simulations, Australia's
vaccination strategy can feasibly reduce required lockdown intensity and
initial epidemic growth rate by 43% and 52%, respectively. The severity of
epidemics, as measured by the peak number of daily new cases, decreases by up
to two orders of magnitude under plausible mass-vaccination and lockdown
strategies.
  Interpretation: The study presents a strong argument for a large-scale
vaccination campaign in Australia, which would substantially reduce both the
intensity of future outbreaks and the stringency of non-pharmaceutical
interventions required for their suppression.

  Software Repositories (MSR'21)",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction model is a classifier to predict if a
commit is defect-introducing. Recently, CC2Vec -- a deep learning approach for
Just-In-Time defect prediction -- has been proposed. However, CC2Vec requires
the whole dataset (i.e., training + testing) for model training, assuming that
all unlabelled testing datasets would be available beforehand, which does not
follow the key principles of just-in-time defect predictions. Our replication
study shows that, after excluding the testing dataset for model training, the
F-measure of CC2Vec is decreased by 38.5% for OpenStack and 45.7% for Qt,
highlighting the negative impact of excluding the testing dataset for
Just-In-Time defect prediction. In addition, CC2Vec cannot perform fine-grained
predictions at the line level (i.e., which lines are most risky for a given
commit).
  In this paper, we propose JITLine -- a Just-In-Time defect prediction
approach for predicting defect-introducing commits and identifying lines that
are associated with that defect-introducing commit (i.e., defective lines).
Through a case study of 37,524 commits from OpenStack and Qt, we find that our
JITLine approach is at least 26%-38% more accurate (F-measure), 17%-51% more
cost-effective (PCI@20%LOC), 70-100 times faster than the state-of-the-art
approaches (i.e., CC2Vec and DeepJIT) and the fine-grained predictions at the
line level by our approach are 133%-150% more accurate (Top-10 Accuracy) than
the baseline NLP approach. Therefore, our JITLine approach may help
practitioners to better prioritize defect-introducing commits and better
identify defective lines.

neutrino emission from thermal processes: pair annihilation, plasmon decay,
photoneutrino process, bremsstrahlung and recombination processes in burning
stages of selected VMS models. We use the realistic conditions of temperature,
density, electron fraction and nuclear isotropic composition of the VMS.
Results are presented for a set of progenitor stars with mass of 150, 200 and
300 M$_\odot$ Z=0.002 and 500 M$_\odot$ Z=0.006 rotating models which are
expected to explode as a pair instability supernova at the end of their life
except the 300 M$_\odot$ would end up as a black hole. It is found that for
VMS, thermal neutrino emission occurs as early as towards the end of hydrogen
burning stage due to the high initial temperature and density of these VMS. We
calculate the total neutrino emissivity, $Q_\nu$ and luminosity, $L_\nu$ using
the structure profile of each burning stages of the models and observed the
contribution of photoneutrino at early burning stages (H and He) and pair
annihilation at the advanced stages. Pair annihilation and photoneutrino
processes are the most dominant neutrino energy loss mechanisms throughout the
evolutionary track of the VMS. At the O-burning stage, the neutrino luminosity
$\sim 10^{47-48}$ erg/s depending on their initial mass and metallicity are
slightly higher than the neutrino luminosity from massive stars. This could
shed light on the possibility of using detection of neutrinos to locate the
candidates for pair instability supernova in our local universe.

technology. However, they are prone to errors caused by multi-path interference
(MPI) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Traditional methods, after
denoising, mitigate MPI by estimating a transient image that encodes depths.
Recently, data-driven methods that jointly denoise and mitigate MPI have become
state-of-the-art without using the intermediate transient representation. In
this paper, we propose to revisit the transient representation. Using
data-driven priors, we interpolate/extrapolate iToF frequencies and use them to
estimate the transient image. Given direct ToF (dToF) sensors capture transient
images, we name our method iToF2dToF. The transient representation is flexible.
It can be integrated with different rule-based depth sensing algorithms that
are robust to low SNR and can deal with ambiguous scenarios that arise in
practice (e.g., specular MPI, optical cross-talk). We demonstrate the benefits
of iToF2dToF over previous methods in real depth sensing scenarios.

  Analysis",,,,,"stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multimodal imaging has transformed neuroscience research. While it presents
unprecedented opportunities, it also imposes serious challenges. Particularly,
it is difficult to combine the merits of the interpretability attributed to a
simple association model with the flexibility achieved by a highly adaptive
nonlinear model. In this article, we propose an orthogonalized kernel debiased
machine learning approach, which is built upon the Neyman orthogonality and a
form of decomposition orthogonality, for multimodal data analysis. We target
the setting that naturally arises in almost all multimodal studies, where there
is a primary modality of interest, plus additional auxiliary modalities. We
establish the root-$N$-consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimated
primary parameter, the semi-parametric estimation efficiency, and the
asymptotic validity of the confidence band of the predicted primary modality
effect. Our proposal enjoys, to a good extent, both model interpretability and
model flexibility. It is also considerably different from the existing
statistical methods for multimodal data integration, as well as the
orthogonality-based methods for high-dimensional inferences. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our method through both simulations and an application to a
multimodal neuroimaging study of Alzheimer's disease.

structures, causing unforeseen additional project costs, e.g., lower

community smells in the granularity of community sub-groups using
socio-technical factors. However, refactoring such smells requires the effort
of developers individually. To eliminate them, supportive measures for every
developer should be constructed according to their motifs and working states.
Recent work revealed developers' personalities could influence community
smells' variation, and their sentiments could impact productivity. Thus,
sentiments could be evaluated to predict community smells' occurrence on them.
To this aim, this paper builds a developer-oriented and sentiment-aware
community smell prediction model considering 3 smells such as Organizational
Silo, Lone Wolf, and Bottleneck. Furthermore, it also predicts if a developer
quitted the community after being affected by any smell. The proposed model
achieves cross- and within-project prediction F-Measure ranging from 76% to
93%. Research also reveals 6 sentimental features having stronger predictive
power compared with activeness metrics. Imperative and indicative expressions,
politeness, and several emotions are the most powerful predictors. Finally, we
test statistically the mean and distribution of sentimental features. Based on
our findings, we suggest developers should communicate in a straightforward and

This motivates us to consider a sub-class of absolutely continuous

an estimator which achieves the minimax optimal rate adaptively, i.e., without

social issues on the web, such as online harassment and rumor spread. For such

pointing out factual inaccuracies in rumors. Though adversarial reactions are
prevalent in online conversations, inferring those adverse views (or stance)
from the text in replies is difficult and requires complex natural language
processing (NLP) models. Moreover, conventional NLP models for stance mining
need labeled data for supervised learning. Getting labeled conversations can
itself be challenging as conversations can be on any topic, and topics change

different topics by labeling both users' opinions on the topics (as in pro/con)
and users' stance while replying to others' posts (as in favor/oppose). As we
find limitations with supervised approaches, we propose a weakly-supervised

because membership inference attacks fail to distinguish a member from a nearby

attacks cannot infer membership in this strong setting, and hence inferring
attributes is infeasible. However, under a relaxed notion of attribute
inference, called approximate attribute inference, we show that it is possible
to infer attributes close to the true attributes. We verify our results on

rarely available and assessment of the correction technique must rely on
performance metrics computed with subsets of the only available (biased) data,
which may be misleading. Here we assess the extent to which an acknowledged
sample bias correction technique is likely to improve models' ability to
predict species distributions in the absence of independent data. We assessed
the variation in model predictions induced by the correction and model
stochasticity. We present an index of the effect of correction relative to
model stochasticity, the Relative Overlap Index (ROI). We tested whether the
ROI better represented the effect of correction than classic performance
metrics and absolute overlap metrics using 64 vertebrate species and 21 virtual
species with a generated sample bias. When based on absolute overlaps and
cross-validation performance metrics, we found no effect of correction, except
for cAUC. When considering its effect relative to model stochasticity, the
effect of correction depended on the site and the species. Virtual species
enabled us to verify that the correction actually improved distribution
predictions and the biological relevance of the selected variables at the sites

drive theoretically infinite quality factors and lifetimes for modern
nanophotonics, making room for a variety of emerging applications. Here we use
the peculiar properties possessed by the so-called $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
optical structures to propose the novel mechanism for the quasi-BIC
manifestation governed by the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. In particular,
we study regularities of the spontaneous $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking in
trilayer structures with the outer loss and gain layers consisting of materials
with permittivity close to zero. We reveal singular points on the curves
separating $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and broken-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry states
in the parametric space of the light frequency and the angle of incidence.
These singularities remarkably coincide with the BIC positions at the frequency
of volume plasmon excitation, where the dielectric permittivity vanishes. The
loss and gain value acts as an asymmetry parameter that disturbs conditions of
the ideal BIC inducing the quasi-BIC. Fascinating properties of these
quasi-BICs having ultrahigh quality factors and almost perfect transmission can
be utilized in sensing, nonlinear optics, and other applications.

three dimensions have been intensively studied, the three-dimensional (3D)
shapes of stable prominences before eruptions have not been measured accurately
so far. We intend to make such a measurement to constrain 3D prominence models
and to extend our knowledge of prominences. Using multiperspective observations
from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board SDO and the Extreme Ultraviolet
Imager on board STEREO, we reconstructed 3D coordinates of three stable
prominences: a quiescent, an intermediate, and a mixed type. Based on the 3D
coordinates, we measured the height, length, and inclination angle of the legs
of these prominences. To study the spatial relationship between the footpoints
of prominences and photospheric magnetic structures, we also used the Global
Oscillation Network Group H alpha images and magnetograms from the HMI on board
the SDO. In three stable prominences, we find that the axes of the prominence
legs are inclined by 68 degrees on average to the solar surface. Legs at
different locations along a prominence axis have different heights with a two-
to threefold difference. Our investigation suggests that over 96% of prominence
footpoints in a sample of 70 footpoints are located at supergranular
boundaries. The widths of two legs have similar values measured in two
orthogonal lines of sight. We also find that a prominence leg above the solar
limb showed horizontal oscillations with larger amplitudes at higher locations.
With a limited image resolution and number of cases, our measurement suggests
that the legs of prominences may have various orientations and do not always
stand vertically on the surface of the sun. Moreover, the locations of
prominence legs are closely related to supergranules.

tasks, and suffers from catastrophic forgetting. To balance plasticity and
stability of network in continual learning, in this paper, we propose a novel
network training algorithm called Adam-NSCL, which sequentially optimizes
network parameters in the null space of previous tasks. We first propose two
mathematical conditions respectively for achieving network stability and
plasticity in continual learning. Based on them, the network training for
sequential tasks can be simply achieved by projecting the candidate parameter
update into the approximate null space of all previous tasks in the network
training process, where the candidate parameter update can be generated by
Adam. The approximate null space can be derived by applying singular value
decomposition to the uncentered covariance matrix of all input features of
previous tasks for each linear layer. For efficiency, the uncentered covariance
matrix can be incrementally computed after learning each task. We also
empirically verify the rationality of the approximate null space at each linear
layer. We apply our approach to training networks for continual learning on
benchmark datasets of CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, and the results suggest that
the proposed approach outperforms or matches the state-ot-the-art continual

Environments (IDEs). Its objective is to speed up code writing by predicting
the next code token(s) the developer is likely to write. Research in this area
has substantially bolstered the predictive performance of these techniques.
However, the support to developers is still limited to the prediction of the
next few tokens to type. In this work, we take a step further in this direction
by presenting a large-scale empirical study aimed at exploring the capabilities
of state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models in supporting code completion at
different granularity levels, including single tokens, one or multiple entire
statements, up to entire code blocks (e.g., the iterated block of a for loop).
To this aim, we train and test several adapted variants of the recently
proposed RoBERTa model, and evaluate its predictions from several perspectives,
including: (i) metrics usually adopted when assessing DL generative models
(i.e., BLEU score and Levenshtein distance); (ii) the percentage of perfect
predictions (i.e., the predicted code snippets that match those written by
developers); and (iii) the ""semantic"" equivalence of the generated code as
compared to the one written by developers. The achieved results show that BERT
models represent a viable solution for code completion, with perfect
predictions ranging from ~7%, obtained when asking the model to guess entire

asks us to plan collision-free paths for a team of cooperative agents. In this
work, we show that one of the reasons why MAPF is so hard to solve is due to a
phenomenon called pairwise symmetry, which occurs when two agents have many
different paths to their target locations, all of which appear promising, but
every combination of them results in a collision. We identify several classes
of pairwise symmetries and show that each one arises commonly in practice and
can produce an exponential explosion in the space of possible collision
resolutions, leading to unacceptable runtimes for current state-of-the-art
(bounded-sub)optimal MAPF algorithms. We propose a variety of reasoning
techniques that detect the symmetries efficiently as they arise and resolve
them by using specialized constraints to eliminate all permutations of pairwise
colliding paths in a single branching step. We implement these ideas in the
context of the leading optimal MAPF algorithm CBS and show that the addition of
the symmetry reasoning techniques can have a dramatic positive effect on its
performance - we report a reduction in the number of node expansions by up to

surrounding world. Measures must be taken against attacks on sensors, which
have been a hot topic in the last few years. For that goal one must first
evaluate how sensor attacks affect the system, i.e. which part or whole of the
system will fail if some of the built-in sensors are compromised, or will keep
safe, etc. Among the relevant safety standards, ISO/PAS 21448 addresses the
safety of road vehicles taking into account the performance limitations of
sensors, but leaves security aspects out of scope. On the other hand, ISO/SAE
21434 addresses the security perspective during the development process of
vehicular systems, but not specific threats such as sensor attacks. As a result
the safety of autonomous systems under sensor attack is yet to be addressed. In
this paper we propose a framework that combines safety analysis for scenario
identification, and scenario-based simulation with sensor attack models
embedded. Given an autonomous system model, we identify hazard scenarios caused
by sensor attacks, and evaluate the performance limitations in the scenarios.
We report on a prototype simulator for autonomous vehicles with radar, cameras
and LiDAR along with attack models against the sensors. Our experiments show
that our framework can evaluate how the system safety changes as parameters of
the attacks and the sensors vary.

the water depth, $h$, and the geothermal flux, $F$. Geothermal heating is the
unique forcing mechanism as we consider a flat ice-water interface. Subglacial
lakes are fully convective when $p_i$ is larger than the critical pressure
$p_*\approx 2848$ dbar, but self organize into a lower convective bulk and an
upper stably-stratified layer when $p_i < p_*$, because of the existence at low
pressure of a density maximum at temperature $T_d$ greater than the freezing

the reaction rates of photodisintegrations and capture reactions. Since
experimental data at astrophysically relevant energies are limited, reaction
rate calculations rely on Hauser-Feshbach (HF) theory predictions. The HF
theory requires nuclear physics input such as masses, level densities,
$\gamma$-ray strength functions and proton-nucleus optical potentials (pOMP).
The scope of this work is to improve a global semi-microscopic pOMP at energies
relevant to the p-process. This is achieved by adjusting the normalization
parameters of the OMP to all available proton-capture cross sections measured
at low energies. By establishing the systematic behaviour of these parameters,
one expects to enhance the predictive power of the pOMP when expanding to mass
regions where no data exists. The HF calculations were obtained using TALYS
code. The normalization parameters for the real and imaginary central
potentials ($\lambda_V$ and $\lambda_W$) were adjusted to fit the proton data
in the energy range where the cross-section are independent of the other
nuclear inputs. Results show that the $\lambda_V$ parameter has a strong mass
dependence that can be described by a second-degree polynomial function for A
$\leq$ 100 and an exponential increase for 100 < A < 162. Though variations of
the $\lambda_W$ have a smaller effect on the calculations, a global increase by
50$\%$ improves the results for certain nuclei without affecting the rest of
the cases. The resulting adjustment functions were obtained by fitting all
suitable proton data and can be used with reasonable confidence to generate the
global semi-microscopic pOMP for nuclei in the medium to heavy mass region. For
better statistics, more low-energy (p,$\gamma$) cross section data are needed
for heavier nuclei with mass A $>$ 100.

prior modeling-based conceptual coding scheme towards extremely low bitrate
image compression, which leverages semantic-wise deep representations as a
unified prior for entropy estimation and texture synthesis. Specifically, we
employ semantic segmentation maps as structural guidance for extracting deep
semantic prior, which provides fine-grained texture distribution modeling for
better detail construction and higher flexibility in subsequent high-level
vision tasks. Moreover, a cross-channel entropy model is proposed to further
exploit the inter-channel correlation of the spatially independent semantic
prior, leading to more accurate entropy estimation for rate-constrained

while still enjoying high visual reconstruction quality and versatility towards

to remain covert, i.e., hide its presence against the networked monitor; 3) the
attacker could insert, delete, or replace compromised observable events; 4) it
performs bounded sensor attacks, i.e., the length of each string output of the
sensor attacker is upper bounded by a given constant. The solution methodology
proposed in this work is to solve the covert sensor attack synthesis problem
for networked DES by modeling it as the well studied Ramadge-Wonham supervisor

performed using the Pencil Code, a high-order finite difference code. An
overset-grid method is used to precisely simulate the flow around the cylinder.
The ratio of particles impacting the cylinder and the number of particles
inserted upstream of the cylinder is used to calculate an impaction efficiency.
It is found that both the particle conductivity and the temperature gradient
have a close to linear influence on the particle impaction efficiency for small
particles. Higher Reynolds numbers result in higher impaction efficiency for
middle-sized particles, while the impaction efficiency is smaller for smaller
particles. In general, it is found that thermophoresis only has an effect on
the small particles, while for larger particles the impaction efficiency is
controlled by inertial impaction.
  Finally, an algebraic model, developed based on fundamental principles, which
describes the effect of thermophoresis is presented. The model is found to
accurately predict the DNS results. As such, this model can be used to
understand the mechanisms behind particle deposition due to the thermophoretic
force, and, more importantly, to identify means by which the deposition rate

angular-diameter distances. In this study, under the assumption of a flat

promising complementary probes at much higher redshifts, whereas compact radio
quasars perform better than ultraviolet and X-ray quasars at the current
observational level; 2) strong degeneracy between the cosmic equation of state

features. Their diagonalizing matrices correspond to the bimaximal mixing

level, and it becomes more crucial to maintain reliable sensor networks. In
this paper, we provide how to efficiently and reliably manage the sensor
monitoring system for securing fresh data at the data center (DC). A sensor
transmits its sensing information regularly to the DC, and the freshness of the
information at the DC is characterized by the age of information (AoI) that
quantifies the timeliness of information. By considering the effect of the AoI
and the spatial distance from the sensor on the information error at the DC, we
newly define an error-tolerable sensing (ETS) coverage as the area that the
estimated information is with smaller error than the target value. We then
derive the average AoI and the AoI violation probability of the sensor
monitoring system, and finally present the {\eta}-coverage probability, which
is the probability that the ETS coverage is greater than {\eta} ratio of the
maximum sensor coverage. We also provide the optimal transmission power of the
sensor, which minimizes the average energy consumption while guaranteeing
certain level of the {\eta}-coverage probability. Numerical results validate
the theoretical analysis and show the tendency of the optimal transmission
power according to the maximum number of retransmissions. This paper can pave
the way to efficient design of the AoI-sensitive sensor networks for IoT.

Combining local computing and federated learning can train a powerful AI model
under the premise of ensuring local data privacy while making full use of

Non-independent and identical distribution (Non-IID) and imbalance of local

cluster-based clients selection method that can generate a federated virtual

heterogeneity and proved that the proposed scheme could converge to an
approximate optimal solution. Based on the clustering method, we propose an
auction-based clients selection scheme within each cluster that fully considers
the system's energy heterogeneity and gives the Nash equilibrium solution of
the proposed scheme for balance the energy consumption and improving the
convergence rate. The simulation results show that our proposed selection

  Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Absolute camera pose estimation is usually addressed by sequentially solving
two distinct subproblems: First a feature matching problem that seeks to
establish putative 2D-3D correspondences, and then a Perspective-n-Point
problem that minimizes, with respect to the camera pose, the sum of so-called
Reprojection Errors (RE). We argue that generating putative 2D-3D
correspondences 1) leads to an important loss of information that needs to be
compensated as far as possible, within RE, through the choice of a robust loss
and the tuning of its hyperparameters and 2) may lead to an RE that conveys
erroneous data to the pose estimator. In this paper, we introduce the Neural
Reprojection Error (NRE) as a substitute for RE. NRE allows to rethink the
camera pose estimation problem by merging it with the feature learning problem,
hence leveraging richer information than 2D-3D correspondences and eliminating
the need for choosing a robust loss and its hyperparameters. Thus NRE can be
used as training loss to learn image descriptors tailored for pose estimation.
We also propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method able to very efficiently
minimize a sum of NRE terms with respect to the camera pose. We experimentally
demonstrate that NRE is a good substitute for RE as it significantly improves
both the robustness and the accuracy of the camera pose estimate while being
computationally and memory highly efficient. From a broader point of view, we
believe this new way of merging deep learning and 3D geometry may be useful in
other computer vision applications.

source code from the two heterogeneous modalities of the Abstract Syntax Tree

sequence provides the global semantic information of AST, while the graph
convolution focuses on the local details. The MMTrans uses two encoders to
extract both global and local semantic information from the two modalities
respectively, and then uses a joint decoder to generate code comments. Both the
encoders and the decoder employ the multi-head attention structure of the
Transformer to enhance the ability to capture the long-range dependencies
between code tokens. We build a dataset with over 300K <method, comment> pairs
of smart contracts, and evaluate the MMTrans on it. The experimental results
demonstrate that the MMTrans outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in

representation. The Poincar\'{e} lemma is essential to handle such path
representation problem in high dimensions. We provide a sufficient condition on
the vector field such that this path representation holds in high dimensions.
Moreover, this Onsager-Machlup action functional may be considered as the
integral of a Lagrangian. Finally, by a variational principle, we investigate
the most probable transition pathways analytically and numerically.

Majoron. We only focus on a case where the Majoron $\phi$ does not exist at the
beginning of the universe and is created by neutrino inverse decay $\nu\nu\to
\phi$ after electron-positron annihilation. In this case, contributions of the
new gauge boson $Z'$ and Majoron $\phi$ to the effective number of neutrino
species $N_{\rm eff}$ can be calculated in separate periods. These contribution
are labelled $N'_{\rm eff}$ for the U(1)$_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ gauge boson and
$\Delta N_{\rm eff}^\prime$ for the Majoron. The effective number $N_{\rm eff}
= N'_{\rm eff} + \Delta N_{\rm eff}^\prime$ is evaluated by the evolution
equations of the temperatures and the chemical potentials of light particles in
each period.
  As a result, we found that the heavier $Z'$ mass $m_{Z^\prime}$ results in
the smaller $N_{\mathrm{eff}}^\prime$ and requires the larger $\Delta
N_{\mathrm{eff}}^\prime$ to resolve the Hubble tension. Therefore, compared to
previous studies, the parameter region where the Hubble tension can be resolved
is slightly shifted toward the larger value of $m_{Z^\prime}$.

Common process
mining techniques consider the process as a whole. However, in real-life
business processes, different behaviors exist that make the overall process too
complex to interpret. Process comparison is a branch of process mining that
isolates different behaviors of the process from each other by using process
cubes. Process cubes organize event data using different dimensions. Each cell
contains a set of events that can be used as an input to apply process mining
techniques. Existing work on process cubes assume single case notions. However,
in real processes, several case notions (e.g., order, item, package, etc.) are
intertwined. Object-centric process mining is a new branch of process mining
addressing multiple case notions in a process. To make a bridge between

exoplanets using infrared transmission photometry with Spitzer/IRAC at 3.6 and
4.5um. Methods. We uniformly analyze 70 photometric light curves of 33
transiting planets using our custom pipeline, which implements pixel level
decorrelation. We use this survey to understand how infrared photometry traces
changes in atmospheric chemical properties as a function of planetary
temperature. We compare our measurements to a grid of 1D radiative-convective
equilibrium forward atmospheric models which include disequilibrium chemistry.
We explore various strengths of vertical mixing (Kzz = 0 - 10^12 cm2/s) as well
as two chemical compositions (1x and 30x solar). Results. We find that, on
average, Spitzer probes a difference of 0.5 atmospheric scale heights between
3.6 and 4.5um, which is measured at 7.5sigma level of significance. We find
that the coolest planets show a lack of methane compared to expectations, which
has also been reported by previous studies of individual objects. We show that
the sample of coolest planets rule out 1x solar composition with >3sigma
confidence while supporting low vertical mixing (Kzz = 10^8 cm2/s). On the
other hand, we find that the hot planets are best explained by models with 1x
solar metallicity and high vertical mixing (Kzz = 10^12 cm2/s). We interpret
this as the lofting of CH4 to the upper atmospheric layers. Changing the
interior temperature changes the expectation for equilibrium chemistry in deep
layers, hence the expectation of disequilibrium chemistry higher up. We also
find a significant scatter in the transmission signatures of the mid-temperate
and ultra-hot planets, likely due to increased atmospheric diversity, without
the need to invoke higher metallicities. Additionally, we compare Spitzer
transmission with emission for the same planets and find no evidence for
correlation.

automatic speech recognition (ASR) solutions to a direct device has become
crucial. Researchers and industry prefer to use end-to-end ASR systems for
on-device speech recognition tasks. This is because end-to-end systems can be
made resource-efficient while maintaining a higher quality compared to hybrid
systems. However, building end-to-end models requires a significant amount of
speech data. Another challenging task associated with speech assistants is
personalization, which mainly lies in handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
In this work, we consider building an effective end-to-end ASR system in
low-resource setups with a high OOV rate, embodied in Babel Turkish and Babel
Georgian tasks. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a method of
dynamic acoustic unit augmentation based on the BPE-dropout technique. It
non-deterministically tokenizes utterances to extend the token's contexts and
to regularize their distribution for the model's recognition of unseen words.
It also reduces the need for optimal subword vocabulary size search. The
technique provides a steady improvement in regular and personalized
(OOV-oriented) speech recognition tasks (at least 6% relative WER and 25%
relative F-score) at no additional computational cost. Owing to the use of
BPE-dropout, our monolingual Turkish Conformer established a competitive result
with 22.2% character error rate (CER) and 38.9% word error rate (WER), which is
close to the best published multilingual system.

Artificial defects can identify holes in a test suite, and thus provide
concrete suggestions for additional tests. Despite the obvious advantages of
mutation testing, it is not yet well established in practice. Until recently,
mutation testing tools and techniques simply did not scale to complex systems.
Although they now do scale, a remaining obstacle is lack of evidence that
writing tests for mutants actually improves test quality. In this paper we aim
to fill this gap: By analyzing a large dataset of almost 15 million mutants, we
investigate how these mutants influenced developers over time, and how these
mutants relate to real faults. Our analyses suggest that developers using
mutation testing write more tests, and actively improve their test suites with
high quality tests such that fewer mutants remain. By analyzing a dataset of
past fixes of real high-priority faults, our analyses further provide evidence
that mutants are indeed coupled with real faults. In other words, had mutation
testing been used for the changes introducing the faults, it would have
reported a live mutant that could have prevented the bug.

The obtained model depends explicitly on the characteristics of the grid as

obstruction to the formation of exponentially localized Wannier functions, but

same reason, FTIs do not host symmetry-protected flow of edge states between
bulk bands in cylindrical boundary conditions but are expected to have a
spectral flow between the fragile bands and other bands under certain twisted
boundary conditions. We here analyze commonly observed effects of strong
correlations, such as the Mott-insulator transition and magnetism, on a known
model hosting fragile topology. We show that in the nonmagnetic case, fragile
topology, along with the twisted boundary states, is stable with interactions
below a critical interaction strength. Above this interaction strength, a
transition to the Mott insulating phase occurs, and the twisted boundary states
disappear. Furthermore, by applying a homogeneous magnetic field, the fragile
topology is destroyed. However, we show that a magnetic field can induce a
topological phase transition which converts a fragile topological insulator to
a Chern insulator. Finally, we study ferromagnetic solutions of the fragile

missing patterns are commonly assumed to be completely random, but in medical

among other causes. This paper proposes to model medical data records with
heterogeneous data types and bursty missing data using sequential variational
autoencoders (VAEs). In particular, we propose a new methodology, the Shi-VAE,
which extends the capabilities of VAEs to sequential streams of data with
missing observations. We compare our model against state-of-the-art solutions
in an intensive care unit database (ICU) and a dataset of passive human
monitoring. Furthermore, we find that standard error metrics such as RMSE are
not conclusive enough to assess temporal models and include in our analysis the
cross-correlation between the ground truth and the imputed signal. We show that
Shi-VAE achieves the best performance in terms of using both metrics, with
lower computational complexity than the GP-VAE model, which is the
state-of-the-art method for medical records.

mass which, simultaneously, explains observed baryon asymmetry of the
Universe(BAU). In minimal extension of the standard model(SM) with two
right-handed neutrinos we work in a supersymmetric framework. At Type-I seesaw
level, the model predicts scaling in the neutrino mass matrix. In order to have
correct low energy phenomenology, we propose two possible scenarios of
scale-breaking in the neutrino mass matrix emanating from Type-I seesaw.
Scenario-1 is based on the dimension-5 Weinberg operator whereas scenario-2
implements Type-II seesaw via scalar triplet Higgs
superfields($\Delta,\bar{\Delta}$). Interestingly, the breaking patterns in
both, otherwise dynamically different scenarios, are similar which can be
attributed to the same charge assignments of superfields($\Delta,\bar{\Delta}$)
and the Higgs superfield $H_u$ under modular $A_4$ symmetry. The breaking is
found to be proportional to the Yukawa coupling of modular weight
10($Y_{1,1'}^{10}$). We, further, investigates the predictions of the model
under scenario-2 (Type-I+II) for neutrino mass, mixings and matter-antimatter
asymmetry of the Universe. The model predicts normal hierarchical neutrino
masses and provide a robust range ($0.05-0.08$)eV for sum of neutrino
masses($\sum m_{i}$). Lepton number violating $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay
amplitude($M_{ee}$) is obtained to lie in the range ($0.04-0.06$)eV. Future
$0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments such as NEXT and nEXO shall pose crucial
test for the model. Both $CP$ conserving and $CP$ violating solutions are
allowed in the model. Interesting correlations are obtained, specially, between
Yukawa couplings of modular weight 2 and complex modulus $\tau$. The model
exhibit consistent explanation of BAU for right-handed Majorana neutrino mass
scale in the range ($(1-5)\times10^{13}$)GeV.

  Transfer",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Style transfer aims to render the content of a given image in the
graphical/artistic style of another image. The fundamental concept underlying
NeuralStyle Transfer (NST) is to interpret style as a distribution in the
feature space of a Convolutional Neural Network, such that a desired style can
be achieved by matching its feature distribution. We show that most current
implementations of that concept have important theoretical and practical
limitations, as they only partially align the feature distributions. We propose
a novel approach that matches the distributions more precisely, thus
reproducing the desired style more faithfully, while still being
computationally efficient. Specifically, we adapt the dual form of Central
Moment Discrepancy (CMD), as recently proposed for domain adaptation, to
minimize the difference between the target style and the feature distribution
of the output image. The dual interpretation of this metric explicitly matches
all higher-order centralized moments and is therefore a natural extension of
existing NST methods that only take into account the first and second moments.
Our experiments confirm that the strong theoretical properties also translate
to visually better style transfer, and better disentangle style from semantic
image content.

several indications that the standard picture of activated dynamics in terms of

principally driven by entropic instead of energetic barriers. In particular, we
illustrate that activation is not controlled by the hopping of high energetic
barriers, and should more properly be interpreted as the entropic selection of
nearly barrierless but rare pathways connecting metabasins on the landscape.

lets the others choose BOPS or purchasing at the store. (2) It lets consumers
far from the physical store choose delivery from the fulfillment center and the
others choose BOPS or purchasing at the store. (3) It lets all consumers choose

interfaces between transparent conducting oxides, have received tremendous
attention in view of electronic applications. The challenge is to find a
material system that exhibits both a high charge-carrier density and mobility,
at and even above room temperature. Here, we explore the potential of
interfaces formed by two lattice-matched wide-gap oxides of emerging interest,
$\textit{i.e.}$, the polar, orthorhombic perovskite LaInO$_{3}$ and the
non-polar, cubic perovskite BaSnO$_{3}$, employing density-functional theory
and many-body theory. We demonstrate that this material combination exhibits
all the key features for reaching the goal. For periodic heterostructures, we
find that the polar discontinuity at the interface is mainly compensated by
electronic relaxation through charge transfer from the LaInO$_{3}$ to the
BaSnO$_{3}$ side. This leads to the formation of a 2DEG hosted by the
highly-dispersive Sn-$s$-derived conduction band and a 2D hole gas of O-$p$
character, strongly localized inside LaInO$_{3}$. Remarkably, structural
distortions through octahedra tilts induce a depolarization field counteracting
the polar discontinuity, and thus increasing the $critical$ (minimal)
LaInO$_{3}$ thickness, $t_c$, required for the formation of a 2DEG. These polar
distortions decrease with increasing LaInO$_{3}$ thickness, enhancing the polar
discontinuity and leading to a 2DEG density of 0.5 electron per unit-cell
surface. Interestingly, in non-periodic heterostructures, these distortions
lead to a decrease of $t_c$, thereby enhancing and delocalizing the 2DEG. We
rationalize how polar distortions, termination, and thickness can be exploited
in view of tailoring the 2DEG characteristics, and why this material is
superior to the most studied prototype LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$.

merits of osseous regeneration and local multidrug therapy so as to avoid
bacterial growth, drug resistance and the feared side effects. Herein,
hierarchical 3D multidrug scaffolds based on nanocomposite bioceramic and
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) prepared by rapid prototyping with an external coating
of gelatin-glutaraldehyde (Gel-Glu) have been fabricated. These 3D scaffolds
contain three antimicrobial agents (rifampin, levofloxacin and vancomycin),
which have been localized in different compartments of the scaffold to obtain
different release kinetics and more effective combined therapy. Levofloxacin
was loaded into the mesopores of nanocomposite bioceramic part, vancomycin was
localized into PVA biopolymer part and rifampin was loaded in the external
coating of Gel-Glu. The obtained results show an early and fast release of
rifampin followed by sustained and prolonged release of vancomycin and
levofloxacin, respectively, which are mainly governed by the progressive in
vitro degradability rate of these scaffolds. This combined therapy is able to
destroy Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria biofilms as well as inhibit
the bacteria growth; in addition, these multifunctional scaffolds exhibit
excellent bioactivity as well as good biocompatibility with complete cell
colonization of preosteoblast in the entire surface, ensuring good bone
regeneration. These findings suggest that these hierarchical 3D multidrug
scaffolds are promising candidates as platforms for local bone infection

Within this correspondence we show that in conformal quantum mechanics the
state associated to the inertial vacuum in Minkowski space-time has the
structure of a thermofield double. Such state is built from a bipartite ""vacuum
state"", the ground state of the generators of hyperbolic time evolution, which
cover only part of the time domain. When time evolution is restricted to a
finite time domain one obtains the temperature perceived by static diamond
observers in the Minkowski vacuum. When time evolution is determined by
dilations, covering only half of the time line, the temperature of the
thermofield double corresponds to the non-vanishing temperature perceived by
Milne observers whose proper time evolution is confined to the future cone
(Milne universe) of Minkowski space-time. The two pictures are related by a
conformal transformation on the real line. Our result provides a purely group
theoretical derivation of the Milne and diamond temperature and shows that the
fundamental ingredient for vacuum thermal effects is the presence of a horizon

be effective for all scenarios since they often need an ad-hoc manual selection

propose a novel multi-objective evolutionary hyper-heuristic approach, dubbed
Sentinel, to automate the generation of optimal cost reduction strategies for
every new SUT. We evaluate Sentinel by carrying out a thorough empirical study
involving 40 releases of 10 open-source real-world software systems and both
baseline and state-of-the-art strategies as a benchmark. We execute a total of
4,800 experiments, and evaluate their results with both quality indicators and
statistical significance tests, following the most recent best practice in the
literature. The results show that strategies generated by Sentinel outperform
the baseline strategies in 95% of the cases always with large effect sizes.
They also obtain statistically significantly better results than
state-of-the-art strategies in 88% of the cases, with large effect sizes for
95% of them. Also, our study reveals that the mutation strategies generated by
Sentinel for a given software version can be used without any loss in quality
for subsequently developed versions in 95% of the cases. These results show
that Sentinel is able to automatically generate mutation strategies that reduce
mutation testing cost without affecting its testing effectiveness (i.e.
mutation score), thus taking off from the tester's shoulders the burden of
manually selecting and configuring strategies for each SUT.

approximates the p-QLP with high accuracy. Fundamental in our work is the
exploitation of randomization and in contrast to the p-QLP, PbP-QLP does not
use the pivoting strategy. As such, PbP-QLP can harness modern computer
architectures, even better than competing randomized algorithms. The efficiency
and effectiveness of our proposed PbP-QLP algorithm are investigated through
various classes of synthetic and real-world data matrices.

  Segmentation","AAAI 2021, Accepted",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using image-level labels has
recently attracted much attention for reducing annotation costs. Existing WSSS
methods utilize localization maps from the classification network to generate
pseudo segmentation labels. However, since localization maps obtained from the
classifier focus only on sparse discriminative object regions, it is difficult
to generate high-quality segmentation labels. To address this issue, we
introduce discriminative region suppression (DRS) module that is a simple yet
effective method to expand object activation regions. DRS suppresses the
attention on discriminative regions and spreads it to adjacent
non-discriminative regions, generating dense localization maps. DRS requires
few or no additional parameters and can be plugged into any network.
Furthermore, we introduce an additional learning strategy to give a
self-enhancement of localization maps, named localization map refinement
learning. Benefiting from this refinement learning, localization maps are
refined and enhanced by recovering some missing parts or removing noise itself.
Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, our approach achieves mIoU 71.4% on
the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark using only image-level labels.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code
is available at https://github.com/qjadud1994/DRS.

thisissue in the simplest way, where the rule of weighted propagation of

this gap by proposing a data- and knowledge-driven probabilistic graphical

Ideological scaling for users in social networks such as Twitter is an example,
but similar settings can include diverse applications in other networks and
even media platforms or e-commerce. A growing literature of ideology scaling
methods in social networks restricts the scaling procedure to nodes that
provide interpretability of the feature space: on Twitter, it is common to
consider the sub-network of parliamentarians and their followers. This allows
to interpret inferred latent features as indices for ideology-related concepts
inspecting the position of members of parliament. While effective in inferring
meaningful features, this is generally restrained to these sub-networks,
limiting interesting applications such as country-wide measurement of
polarization and its evolution. We propose two methods to propagate ideological
features beyond these sub-networks: one based on homophily (linked users have
similar ideology), and the other on structural similarity (nodes with similar
neighborhoods have similar ideologies). In our methods, we leverage the concept
of neighborhood ideological coherence as a parameter for propagation. Using
Twitter data, we produce an ideological scaling for 370K users, and analyze the
two families of propagation methods on a population of 6.5M users. We find
that, when coherence is considered, the ideology of a user is better estimated
from those with similar neighborhoods, than from their immediate neighbors.

sound speed which make perturbations unstable. The Anton-Schmidt model with
$\gamma_{\rm G}=\frac{5}{6}$ is ruled out while the generalized logotropic
fluid seems to be the most suitable one, albeit weakly disfavored than the
$\Lambda$CDM model. We combine low- and higher-redshift domains through
experimental fits based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain procedures, taking into
account supernovae Ia catalogue, Hubble measurements and $\sigma_8$ data

  In this note, we show that the $m$-dimensional knapsack problem with a
$\Delta$-modular constraints matrix admits an FPTAS, whose complexity bound
depends on $\Delta$ linearly. More precisely, the proposed algorithm complexity
is $$O(T_{LP} \cdot (1/\varepsilon)^{m+3} \cdot (2m)^{2m + 6} \cdot \Delta),$$

generalisation of the classical FPTAS for the $1$-dimensional case.
  Strictly speaking, the considered problem can be solved by an exact
polynomial-time algorithm, when $m$ is fixed and $\Delta$ grows as a polynomial
on $n$. This fact can be observed combining previously known results. In this
paper, we give a slightly more accurate analysis to present an exact algorithm

the last bound is non-linear by $\Delta$ with respect to the given FPTAS.

embryo selection model using only time-lapse image sequences performs across
different patient ages and clinical conditions, and how it correlates with
traditional morphokinetic parameters. The model was trained and evaluated based
on a large dataset from 18 IVF centers consisting of 115,832 embryos, of which
14,644 embryos were transferred KID embryos. In an independent test set, the AI
model sorted KID embryos with an area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver
operating characteristic curve of 0.67 and all embryos with an AUC of 0.95. A
clinic hold-out test showed that the model generalized to new clinics with an
AUC range of 0.60-0.75 for KID embryos. Across different subgroups of age,
insemination method, incubation time, and transfer protocol, the AUC ranged
between 0.63 and 0.69. Furthermore, model predictions correlated positively
with blastocyst grading and negatively with direct cleavages. The fully
automated iDAScore v1.0 model was shown to perform at least as good as a

  Prediction Use-Case","7 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  6G is the next generation for the communication systems. In recent years,
machine learning algorithms have been applied widely in various fields such as
health, transportation, and the autonomous car. The predictive algorithms will
be used in 6G problems. With the rapid developments of deep learning
techniques, it is critical to take the security concern into account to apply
the algorithms. While machine learning offers significant advantages for 6G, AI
models' security is ignored. Since it has many applications in the real world,
security is a vital part of the algorithms. This paper has proposed a
mitigation method for adversarial attacks against proposed 6G machine learning
models for the millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction with adversarial
learning. The main idea behind adversarial attacks against machine learning
models is to produce faulty results by manipulating trained deep learning
models for 6G applications for mmWave beam prediction use case. We have also
presented the adversarial learning mitigation method's performance for 6G
security in millimeter-wave beam prediction application with fast gradient sign
method attack. The mean square errors of the defended model and undefended

Traditionally, conservationists have identified species by ear; however, it is
now common to deploy audio recording technology to monitor animal and ecosystem
sounds. Animals use sound for communication, mating, navigation and territorial
defence. Animal sounds provide valuable information and help conservationists
to quantify biodiversity. Acoustic monitoring has grown in popularity due to
the availability of diverse sensor types which include camera traps, portable
acoustic sensors, passive acoustic sensors, and even smartphones. Passive
acoustic sensors are easy to deploy and can be left running for long durations
to provide insights on habitat and the sounds made by animals and illegal
activity. While this technology brings enormous benefits, the amount of data
that is generated makes processing a time-consuming process for
conservationists. Consequently, there is interest among conservationists to
automatically process acoustic data to help speed up biodiversity assessments.
Processing these large data sources and extracting relevant sounds from
background noise introduces significant challenges. In this paper we outline an
approach for achieving this using state of the art in machine learning to
automatically extract features from time-series audio signals and modelling
deep learning models to classify different bird species based on the sounds

Leakage is a common complication and may occur due to too much cement being

quantum Gibbs states, which are quantum statistical equilibria with prescribed
particle, current, and energy densities at each point of space (here R d , d
$\ge$ 1). They assume that such local Gibbs states exist, and show that if the
quantum system is initially in a local Gibbs state, then the system stays, in
an appropriate asymptotic limit, in a Gibbs state with particle, current, and
energy densities now solutions to the Euler equations. Our main contribution in
this work is to prove that such local quantum Gibbs states can be constructed
from prescribed densities under mild hypotheses, in both the fermionic and
bosonic cases. The problem consists in minimizing the von Neumann entropy in
the quantum grand canonical picture under constraints of local particle,
current, and energy densities. The main mathematical difficulty is the lack of
compactness of the minimizing sequences to pass to the limit in the
constraints. The issue is solved by defining auxiliary constrained optimization
problems, and by using some monotonicity properties of equilibrium entropies.

determine the extent to which the presence of portal occlusion can affect the
mechanical properties of the liver and potentially lead to misdiagnosis of
fibrosis and hepatic cirrhosis by elastography. Portal vein occlusion was
generated by insertion and inflation of a balloon catheter in the portal vein
of four swines. The portal flow parameters peak flow (PF) and peak velocity
magnitude (PVM) and liver mechanical properties (shear modulus) were then
investigated using 4D-flow MRI and MR elastography, respectively, for
progressive obstructions of the portal vein. Experimental results indicate that
the reduction of the intrahepatic venous blood flow (PF/PVM decreases of
29.3%/8.5%, 51.0%/32.3% and 83.3%/53.6%, respectively) measured with 50%, 80%

on the elasticity of the liver to modify the diagnosis of severe fibrosis or
cirrhosis (F4 METAVIR grade), it may be sufficient to attenuate the increase in
stiffness due to moderate fibrosis (F2-F3 METAVIR grades) and consequently lead
to false-negative diagnoses with elastography in the presence of PVT.

infer its presence in some multipartite states merely from a set of its
separable marginals. Here, we show that the effect can be found also in the
context of Gaussian states of bosonic systems. Specifically, we construct
examples of multimode Gaussian states carrying genuine multipartite
entanglement which can be verified solely from separable nearest-neighbour
two-mode marginals. The key tool of our construction is a genuine multipartite
entanglement witness acting only on some two-mode reductions of the global
covariance matrix, which we find by a numerical solution of a semi-definite
programme. We also propose an experimental scheme for preparation of the
simplest three-mode state, which requires interference of three correlatively

bringing it closer to experimentally testable form, our results pave the way to
effective diagnostics methods of global properties of multipartite states

XMM-Newton observations make U Mon the first RV Tauri variable detected in
X-rays. The X-ray emission is characteristic of a hot plasma ($\sim$10 MK),
with L$_{X}=5\times10^{30}{\rm erg}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, and we consider its possible

DASCH and AAVSO data, we extend the time-series photometric baseline back to
the late 1880s and find evidence that U Mon has secular changes that appear to
recur on a timescale of $\sim$60 yr, possibly caused by a feature in the CBD.
From literature radial velocities we find that the binary companion is a
$\sim$2 M$_{\odot}$ A-type main-sequence star. The orientation of the binary's
orbit lies along our line of sight ($\omega = 95^\circ$), such that apastron
corresponds to photometric RVb minima, consistent with the post-AGB star
becoming obscured by the near side of the CBD. In addition, we find the size of
the inner-CBD hole ($\sim$4.5-9 au) to be comparable to the binary separation,
implying that one or both stars may interact with the CBD at apastron. The
obscuration of the post-AGB star implicates the companion as the likely source
of the enhanced H$\alpha$ observed at RVb minima and of the X-ray emission that
may arise from accreted material.

analysis was performed. The calculation results show the possibility to control
laser micro-machining in volume of SiO2. The obtained characteristic dimensions
of the structures correlate with the experimental results. Comparing to the
porous glass, the mesoporous TiO2 films loaded by Ag ions and nanoparticles
support localized plasmon resonances. To identify the optimum parameters of the
continuous-wave laser, a multi-physical model considering Ag nanoparticle
growth, photo-oxidation, reduction was developed. The performed simulations
show that the laser writing speed controls the Ag nanoparticles size. The
thermally activated fast growth followed by the photo-oxidation was found to be
the main reason for the writing speed-dependent size-change and temperature
rises. Writing of mesoporous TiO2 films loaded with Ag nanoparticles by a
pulsed laser is, furthermore, promising to provide additional possibilities in
the generation of two kinds of nanostructures: laser-induced periodic surface
grooves and Ag nanogratingsinside the TiO2 film. To better understand the
effects of a pulsed laser, two multi-pulses models are developed to simulate
the Ag nanoparticle growth. The obtained results provided new insights into

self-assembly into trains as well as compact chains that can elongate,
break-up, become immobilized and remobilized. We identify the crucial role that
environment morphology and swimmer directionality play on these highly dynamic

courses and degree programs do not support students in developing these
attitudes. Rather physics education filters out students who do not enter
college physics courses with these attitudes. To better understand the role of
attitudes in the lack of diversity in physics, we investigated the intersecting
relationships between racism and sexism in inequities in student attitudes
about learning and doing physics using a critical quantitative framework. The
analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine students attitudes as
measured by the Colorado learning attitudes about science survey. The data came
from the LASSO database and included 2170 students in 46 calculus-based

special cases, assuming the viscosity coefficients to be the power functions of
the density. The results are, in some relevant cases, compared with those of
Belinskii and Khalatnikov (1976) in the asymptotic limits and are seen to agree
with them in that the models start with $\rho = 0$ at the beginning and evolve
with the creation of matter by the gravitational field, finally approaching the
Friedmann universe.

  crystal: experiment vs. simulations on a noisy superconducting quantum
  processor","15 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.str-el","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Emergent metastability in non-equilibrium systems is a subject that touches
everything from the origins of life to the quantum nature of the universe. In
condensed quantum matter, a good topical example is the metastability of
topologically inhibited self-organization of electronic domains in a correlated
electronic crystal in the aftermath of a symmetry-breaking phase transition.
Understanding the dynamics of such systems is crucial for developing new
quantum technologies and exploring fundamental aspects of many-body
non-equilibrium quantum mechanics. Here, a non-equilibrium state is set up by
carrier injection in the quantum material (M), resulting in a domain structure,
whose time-evolution is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy.
Demonstrating a new approach to modelling of emergent non-equilibrium quantum
behavior, we use an array of 2008 qubits in a programmable noisy
superconducting quantum simulator (NSQS) without error correction (P), in which
mutual qubit interconnections correspond directly to the electronic
interactions on the triangular lattice of the electronic crystal material. The
success of the simulations critically depends on both the faithfulness of the
model correspondence between the two systems and careful management of the
decoherence pathways. Importantly, decoherence of both P and M is driven by
noise with a characteristic 1/{\nu} frequency spectrum. The simulations reveal
how an emergent false vacuum state arises, describing the time evolution and
temperature dependence of the observed electronic domain dynamics of M solely
on the basis of microscopic electronic interactions. The parallel experiments
demonstrate the potential of NSQSs for studying emergent non-equilibrium
dynamics in complex many-body quantum systems.

by BESIII Collaboration, $Z_{cs}(4000)^+$, $Z_{cs}(4220)^+$ and the excited
$B_s^0$ states by LHCb Collaboration, a full calculation including masses and
decay widths is emerged in the chiral quark model. For $Z_{cs}$ states, we
assign quantum numbers $I(J^P)=\frac{1}{2}(1^+)$ and quark composition
$c\bar{c}s\bar{u}$ according to the experiment. For $B_s^0$ states,
systematically investigations are performed with $I(J^P)=0(0^+), 0(1^+),
0(2^+)$ both in 2-body $b\bar{s}$ and 4-body $b\bar{s}q\bar{q}~(q=u~\rm{or}~d)$
systems. Each tetraquark calculation takes all structures including
meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and all possible color configurations into
account. Among the numerical techniques to solve the 2-body and 4-body
Schr{\""o}dinger equation, the spatial wave functions are expanded in series of
Gaussian basis functions for high precision, which is the way Gaussian
expansion method so called. Our results indicate that the low-lying states of
4-quark system are all higher than the corresponding thresholds either for
$c\bar{c}s\bar{u}$ or for $b\bar{s}q\bar{q}$ systems. With the help of the real
scaling method, we found two resonance states with masses of 4023 MeV and 4042
MeV for $c\bar{c}s\bar{u}$ system. The state $c\bar{c}s\bar{u}(4042)$ has a
consistent mass and decay width with the recent observed state
$Z_{cs}(3985)^-$. For $b\bar{s}q\bar{q}$ system with $J=0$, some resonance
states are also found. The newly observed excited $B_s^0$ states can be
accommodated in the chiral quark model as $2S$ or $1D$ states, and the mixing
with four-quark states are also needed to be considered.

  Imagery, Point Clouds, and Meshes for Multi-Modal Semantics",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The automatic semantic segmentation of the huge amount of acquired remote
sensing data has become an important task in the last decade. Images and Point
Clouds (PCs) are fundamental data representations, particularly in urban
mapping applications. Textured 3D meshes integrate both data representations
geometrically by wiring the PC and texturing the surface elements with
available imagery. We present a mesh-centered holistic geometry-driven
methodology that explicitly integrates entities of imagery, PC and mesh. Due to
its integrative character, we choose the mesh as the core representation that
also helps to solve the visibility problem for points in imagery. Utilizing the
proposed multi-modal fusion as the backbone and considering the established
entity relationships, we enable the sharing of information across the
modalities imagery, PC and mesh in a two-fold manner: (i) feature transfer and
(ii) label transfer. By these means, we achieve to enrich feature vectors to
multi-modal feature vectors for each representation. Concurrently, we achieve
to label all representations consistently while reducing the manual label
effort to a single representation. Consequently, we facilitate to train machine
learning algorithms and to semantically segment any of these data
representations - both in a multi-modal and single-modal sense. The paper
presents the association mechanism and the subsequent information transfer,
which we believe are cornerstones for multi-modal scene analysis. Furthermore,
we discuss the preconditions and limitations of the presented approach in
detail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on the ISPRS 3D
semantic labeling contest (Vaihingen 3D) and a proprietary data set (Hessigheim
3D).

an LSTM-based object velocity learning module aggregates the long-term

constantly change to capture the dynamic behavior of the phenomena. Topological
persistence which provides a set of birth and death pairs for the topological
features is one instrument for analyzing such changing graph data. However,
standard persistent homology defined over a growing space cannot always capture
such a dynamic process unless shrinking with deletions is also allowed. Hence,
zigzag persistence which incorporates both insertions and deletions of
simplices is more appropriate in such a setting. Unlike standard persistence
which admits nearly linear-time algorithms for graphs, such results for the
zigzag version improving the general $O(m^\omega)$ time complexity are not
known, where $\omega< 2.37286$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. In this
paper, we propose algorithms for zigzag persistence on graphs which run in
near-linear time. Specifically, given a filtration with $m$ additions and
deletions on a graph with $n$ vertices and edges, the algorithm for
$0$-dimension runs in $O(m\log^2 n+m\log m)$ time and the algorithm for
1-dimension runs in $O(m\log^4 n)$ time. The algorithm for $0$-dimension draws
upon another algorithm designed originally for pairing critical points of Morse
functions on $2$-manifolds. The algorithm for $1$-dimension pairs a negative
edge with the earliest positive edge so that a $1$-cycle containing both edges
resides in all intermediate graphs. Both algorithms achieve the claimed time
complexity via dynamic graph data structures proposed by Holm et al. In the
end, using Alexander duality, we extend the algorithm for $0$-dimension to
compute the $(p-1)$-dimensional zigzag persistence for $\mathbb{R}^p$-embedded

via the non-linear, entangling evolution of an initially factorized spin state.
Here we show that robust (i.e. persistent) squeezing dynamics is generated by a
very large class of $S=1/2$ spin Hamiltonians with axial symmetry, in
relationship with the existence of a peculiar structure of the low-lying
Hamiltonian eigenstates - the so-called Anderson's tower of states. Such states
are fundamentally related to the appearance of spontaneous symmetry breaking in
quantum systems; and, for models with sufficiently high connectivity, they are
parametrically close to the eigenstates of a planar rotor (Dicke states), in
that they feature an anomalously large value of the total angular momentum. Our
central insight is that, starting from a coherent spin state, a generic
$U(1)$-symmetric Hamiltonian featuring the Anderson's tower of states generates
the same squeezing evolution at short times as the one governed by the
paradigmatic one-axis-twisting (or planar-rotor) model of squeezing dynamics.
The full squeezing evolution of the planar-rotor model is seemingly reproduced
for interactions decaying with distance $r$ as $r^{-\alpha}$ when $\alpha <
5d/3$ in $d$ dimensions. Our results connect quantum simulation with quantum
metrology by unveiling the squeezing power of a large variety of Hamiltonian
dynamics that are currently implemented by different quantum simulation

respect to the lengths of arcs in the fractals. In this article we first give a
construction method for mixed labyrinth fractals with the property that all

certain family of patterns can provide a mixed labyrinth fractal of any box

we show how the results can be extended to a more general setting.

derive two coupled wave kinetic equations, each describing the evolution of the

that there exist an irreversible transfer of energy that leads to an

main nonlinear transfer mechanism is based on four-wave resonant interactions,
the diatomic one is ruled by a three wave resonant process (two acoustical and
one optical wave): thermalization happens on shorter time scale for the

if the ratio between the heavy and light masses is less than 3. Numerical

problem governing equations, such as Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a
part of the neural network. PINNs have emerged as a new essential tool to solve
various challenging problems, including computing linear systems arising from
PDEs, a task for which several traditional methods exist. In this work, we
focus first on evaluating the potential of PINNs as linear solvers in the case
of the Poisson equation, an omnipresent equation in scientific computing. We
characterize PINN linear solvers in terms of accuracy and performance under
different network configurations (depth, activation functions, input data set
distribution). We highlight the critical role of transfer learning. Our results
show that low-frequency components of the solution converge quickly as an
effect of the F-principle. In contrast, an accurate solution of the high
frequencies requires an exceedingly long time. To address this limitation, we
propose integrating PINNs into traditional linear solvers. We show that this
integration leads to the development of new solvers whose performance is on par
with other high-performance solvers, such as PETSc conjugate gradient linear
solvers, in terms of performance and accuracy. Overall, while the accuracy and
computational performance are still a limiting factor for the direct use of
PINN linear solvers, hybrid strategies combining old traditional linear solver
approaches with new emerging deep-learning techniques are among the most
promising methods for developing a new class of linear solvers.

Aiming at this inability of numerical computation, we propose a novel method
for boosting the mesh density in numerical computation within the 2D domain.
Based on the low mesh-density stress field in the 2D plane strain problem
computed by the finite element method, this method utilizes a deep neural
network named SuperMeshingNet to learn the non-linear mapping from low
mesh-density to high mesh-density stress field, and realizes the improvement of
numerical computation accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. We adopt residual
dense blocks to our mesh-density boost model called SuperMeshingNet for
extracting abundant local features and enhancing the prediction capacity of the
model. Experimental results show that the SuperMeshingNet proposed in this work
can effectively boost the spatial resolution of the stress field under the
multiple scaling factors: 2X, 4X, 8X. Compared to the results of the finite
element method, the predicted stress field error of SuperMeshingNet is only
0.54%, which is within the acceptable range of stress field estimation, and the
SuperMeshingNet predicts the maximum stress value also without significant
accuracy loss. We publicly share our work with full detail of implementation at

effect. A zero-gap antipodal slot line is used as the starting transmission
line, which is then coupled to the topological metasurface via a field matching
procedure. Additional modifications to the interface between the two structures
to eliminate unwanted edge coupling improves transmission further. A simulated
loss analysis isolates the effect of the transitions from the rest of the
structure, showing a loss contribution of only 2.1% per
classical-to-topological conversion. Using the transition, a quantitative
characterization of the robustness of common topologically protected devices is
presented. This design lays the foundation to integrate topologically robust
metasurface transmission lines to traditional systems, opening the door to
future uses of such structures in systems.

spreads. We study the airborne transmission risk associated with holding
in-person classes on university campuses. We utilize a model for airborne
transmission risk in an enclosed room that considers the air change rate for
the room, mask efficiency, initial infection probability of the occupants, and
also the activity level of the occupants. We introduce, and use for our
evaluations, a metric $R_0^{eff}$ that represents the ratio of new infections
that occur over a week due to classroom interactions to the number of infected
individuals at the beginning of the week. This can be seen as a surrogate for
the well-known $R_0$ reproductive number metric, but limited in scope to
classroom interactions and calculated on a weekly basis. The simulations take
into account the possibility of repeated in-classroom interactions between
students throughout the week. We presented model predictions were generated
using Fall 2019 and Fall 2020 course registration data at a large US
university, allowing us to evaluate the difference in transmission risk between
in-person and hybrid programs. We quantify the impact of parameters such as
reduced occupancy levels and mask efficacy. Our simulations indicate that
universal mask usage results in an approximately $3.6\times$ reduction in new
infections through classroom interactions. Moving 90% of the classes online
leads to about $18\times$ reduction in new cases. Reducing class occupancy to
20%, by having hybrid classes, results in an approximately $2.15-2.3\times$
further reduction in new infections.

Invariant time may be formulated as a degenerate orthogonal metric on a flat
phase space with time, position, energy and momentum degrees of freedom that is
also endowed with a symplectic metric $\omega =-d t\wedge d \varepsilon +\delta
_{i,j}d q^i\wedge d p^j$. For Einstein proper time, the degenerate orthogonal
metric is $d \tau^{o 2}=d t^2-\frac{1}{c^2}d q^2$ and, in the limit $c\to
\infty$, becomes Newtonian absolute time, $d t^2$. We show that the the
resulting symmetry group leaving $\omega$ and $d t^2$ invariant is the Jacobi
group that gives the expected transformations between noninertial states
defined by Hamilton's equations. The symmetry group for $\omega$ and $d \tau^{o
2}$ is the semidirect product of the Lorentz and an abelian group parameterized
by the time derivative of the energy-momentum tensor that characterizes
noninertial states in special relativity. This leads to the consideration of
invariant time based on a nondegenerate Born metric, $d \tau^2=d
t^2-\frac{1}{c^2}d q^2-\frac{1}{b^2}d p^2+\frac{1}{b^2c^2}d \varepsilon^2$. $b$
is a universal constant with dimensions of force that, with $c,\hbar$ define
the dimensional scales of phase space. We determine that the symmetry group for
transformations between noninertial states is essentially a noncompact unitary
group. It reduces to the noninertial symmetry group for Einstein proper time in
the $b\to \infty$ limit and to the noninertial symmetry group for Hamiltonian
mechanics in the $b,c\to \infty$ limit. The causal cones in phase space defined
by the null surfaces $d\tau^2=0$ bound the rate of change of momentum as well
as position. Furthermore, spacetime is no longer an invariant subspace of phase
space but depends on the noninertial state; there is neither an absolute rest
state nor an absolute inertial state that all observers agree on.

  Communication",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The design and development of swarms of micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) has
recently gained significant traction. Collaborative aerial swarms have
potential applications in areas as diverse as surveillance and monitoring,
inventory management, search and rescue, or in the entertainment industry.
Swarm intelligence has, by definition, a distributed nature. Yet performing
experiments in truly distributed systems is not always possible, as much of the
underlying ecosystem employed requires some sort of central control. Indeed, in
experimental proofs of concept, most research relies on more traditional
connectivity solutions and centralized approaches. External localization
solutions, such as motion capture (MOCAP) systems, visual markers, or
ultra-wideband (UWB) anchors are often used. Alternatively, intra-swarm
solutions are often limited in terms of, e.g., range or field-of-view. Research
and development has been supported by platforms such as the e-puck, the
kilobot, or the crazyflie quadrotors. We believe there is a need for
inexpensive platforms such as the Crazyflie with more advanced onboard
processing capabilities and sensors, while offering scalability and robust
communication and localization solutions. In the following, we present a
platform for research and development in aerial swarms currently under
development, where we leverage Wi-Fi mesh connectivity and the distributed ROS2
middleware together with UWB ranging and communication for situated
communication. We present a platform for building towards large-scale swarms of
autonomous MAVs leveraging the ROS2 middleware, Wi-Fi mesh connectivity, and
UWB ranging and communication. The platform is based on the Ryze Tello Drone, a
Raspberry Pi Zero W as a companion computer together with a camera module, and
a Decawave DWM1001 UWB module for ranging and basic communication.

points to a main hospital. Blood and other biological samples are collected in
different centers during morning hours. Then, the samples are transported to
the main hospital, for their analysis, by a fleet of vehicles located in
geographically distributed depots. Each sample has a limited lifetime and must
arrive to the main hospital within that time. If a sample cannot arrive to the
hospital within the lifetime, either is discarded or must be processed in
dedicated facilities called Spoke Centers.Two Mixed Integer Linear Programming
formulations and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic
algorithm have been developed for the problem. Computational experiments on
different sets of instances based on real-life data provided by the Local
Healthcare Authority of Bologna, Italy, are presented. A comparison on small
instances with the optimal solutions obtained by the formulations shows the
effectiveness of the proposed ALNS algorithm. On real-life instances, different
batching policies of the samples are evaluated. The results show that the ALNS
algorithm is able to find solutions in which all the samples are delivered on
time, while in the real case about the 40% [5] of the samples is delivered
late.

in which the mesh-density has a significant impact on the results. High mesh
density usually contributes authentic to simulation results but costs more
computing resources, leading to curtailing efficiency during the design
process. To eliminate this drawback, we propose a new data-driven mesh-density
boost model named SuperMeshingNet that strengthens the advantages of finite
element analysis (FEA) with low mesh-density as inputs to the deep learning
model, which consisting of Res-UNet architecture, to acquire high-density
stress field instantaneously, shortening computing time and cost automatically.
Moreover, the attention mechanism and the perceptual features are utilized,
enhancing the performance of SuperMeshingNet. Compared to the baseline that
applied the linear interpolation method, SuperMeshingNet achieves a prominent
reduction in the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) on test
data, which contains prior unseen cases. Based on the data set of metal
forming, the comparable experiments are proceeded to demonstrate the high
quality and superior precision of the reconstructed results generated by our
model. The well-trained model can successfully show more excellent performance
than the baseline and other methods on the multiple scaled mesh-density,
including $2\times$, $4\times$, and $8\times$. With the refined result owning
broaden scaling of mesh density and high precision, the FEA process can be
accelerated with seldom cost on computation resources. We publicly share our

oscillating dipole we show that the radiated electrical field has a
longitudinal component proportional to $ \omega \hat{P}$, where $\hat{P}$ is
the anomalous moment $\int \hat{I}(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{x} d^3x$ and $\hat{I}$ is
the space-dependent part of the anomaly $I=\partial_t \rho+\nabla \cdot

failure of local current conservation causes a ""missing field"" effect that can
