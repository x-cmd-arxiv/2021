against improving performance, scalability, and energy efficiency in modern
systems. Computer systems employ a range of techniques to reduce overheads tied
to data movement, spanning from traditional mechanisms (e.g., deep multi-level
cache hierarchies, aggressive hardware prefetchers) to emerging techniques such
as Near-Data Processing (NDP), where some computation is moved close to memory.
Our goal is to methodically identify potential sources of data movement over a
broad set of applications and to comprehensively compare traditional
compute-centric data movement mitigation techniques to more memory-centric
techniques, thereby developing a rigorous understanding of the best techniques
to mitigate each source of data movement.
  With this goal in mind, we perform the first large-scale characterization of
a wide variety of applications, across a wide range of application domains, to
identify fundamental program properties that lead to data movement to/from main
memory. We develop the first systematic methodology to classify applications
based on the sources contributing to data movement bottlenecks. From our
large-scale characterization of 77K functions across 345 applications, we
select 144 functions to form the first open-source benchmark suite (DAMOV) for
main memory data movement studies. We select a diverse range of functions that
(1) represent different types of data movement bottlenecks, and (2) come from a
wide range of application domains. Using NDP as a case study, we identify new
insights about the different data movement bottlenecks and use these insights
to determine the most suitable data movement mitigation mechanism for a
particular application. We open-source DAMOV and the complete source code for
our new characterization methodology at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/DAMOV.

close this substantial gap and contribute a qualitative study focusing on

discover root causes or improve risk communication. Our study reveals two
\facets of practitioners' mental models of machine learning security. Firstly,
practitioners often confuse machine learning security with threats and defences
that are not directly related to machine learning. Secondly, in contrast to
most academic research, our participants perceive security of machine learning
as not solely related to individual models, but rather in the context of entire
workflows that consist of multiple components. Jointly with our additional
findings, these two facets provide a foundation to substantiate mental models
for machine learning security and have implications for the integration of
adversarial machine learning into corporate workflows, \new{decreasing
practitioners' reported uncertainty}, and appropriate regulatory frameworks for

0.7%, 0.3% and 8% respectively. For HD 222076, they are reduced even more

this has led to the observation of free-electron quantum walks, attosecond

interaction with electron beams through chip-based photonics promises unique
applications in nanoscale quantum control and sensing, but has yet to enter
electron microscopy. Here, we merge integrated photonics with electron

silicon nitride microresonator driven by a continuous-wave laser. The high-Q
factor (~$10^6$) cavity enhancement and a waveguide designed for phase matching
lead to efficient electron-light scattering at unprecedentedly low,
few-microwatt optical powers. Specifically, we fully deplete the initial
electron state at a cavity-coupled power of 6 $\mu$W and create >500 photon
sidebands for only 38 mW in the bus waveguide. Moreover, we demonstrate $\mu$eV

phenomena with complex dependence structures in space and/or time. In
particular, the Gaussian random field is commonly used due to its attractive
properties and mathematical tractability. However, this assumption seems to be
restrictive when dealing with counting data. To deal with this situation, we
propose a random field with a Poisson marginal distribution by considering a
sequence of independent copies of a random field with an exponential marginal
distribution as 'inter-arrival times' in the counting renewal processes
framework. Our proposal can be viewed as a spatial generalization of the

  Unlike the classical hierarchical Poisson Log-Gaussian model, our proposal
generates a (non)-stationary random field that is mean square continuous and
with Poisson marginal distributions. For the proposed Poisson spatial random
field, analytic expressions for the covariance function and the bivariate

weighted pairwise likelihood as a method for estimating the Poisson random

in distant galaxies. [CII] line emission has been suggested to be a powerful
tracer of star-formation. We aim to understand the origin of [CII] emission and
its relation to other tracers of interstellar gas and dust. This includes a
study of the heating efficiency of interstellar gas as traced by the [CII] line
to test models of gas heating. We make use of a one-square-degree map of
velocity-resolved [CII] line emission towards the Orion Nebula complex,
including M43 and NGC 1977. The [CII] intensity is tightly correlated with PAH
emission in the IRAC $8\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ band and far-infrared emission from
warm dust. The correlation between [CII] and CO(2-1) is affected by the
detailed geometry of the region. We find particularly low [CII]-over-FIR
intensity ratios towards large columns of (warm and cold) dust, which suggest
the interpretation of the ""[CII] deficit"" in terms of a ""FIR excess"". A slight
decrease in the FIR line-over-continuum intensity ratio can be attributed to a
decreased heating efficiency of the gas. We find that, at the mapped spatial
scales, predictions of the star-formation rate from [CII] emission
underestimate the star-formation rate calculated from YSO counts in the Orion
Nebula complex by an order of magnitude. [CII] emission from the Orion Nebula
complex arises dominantly in the cloud surfaces, many viewed in edge-on
geometry. [CII] emission from extended faint cloud surfaces may contribute
significantly to the total [CII] emission on galactic scales.

defenders are informed of how the adversaries generate synonyms, which is not a
realistic scenario. In this paper, we propose a certifiably robust defense
method by randomly masking a certain proportion of the words in an input text,
in which the above unrealistic assumption is no longer necessary. The proposed
method can defend against not only word substitution-based attacks, but also
character-level perturbations. We can certify the classifications of over 50%
texts to be robust to any perturbation of 5 words on AGNEWS, and 2 words on

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contrastive learning (CL) methods effectively learn data representations
without label supervision, where the encoder contrasts each positive sample
over multiple negative samples via a one-vs-many softmax cross-entropy loss. By
leveraging large amounts of unlabeled image data, recent CL methods have
achieved promising results when pre-trained on ImageNet, a well-curated data
set with balanced image classes. However, they tend to yield worse performance
when pre-trained on images in the wild. In this paper, to further improve the
performance of CL and enhance its robustness on uncurated data sets, we propose
a doubly CL strategy that contrasts the positive (negative) samples of a query
within themselves before deciding how strongly to pull (push) them. We realize
this strategy with contrastive attraction and contrastive repulsion (CACR),
which makes the query not only exert a greater force to attract more distant
positive samples but also do so to repel closer negative samples. Theoretical
analysis reveals that CACR generalizes CL's behavior by taking into
consideration the differences between the distributions of the
positive/negative samples, which in general are sampled independently of the
query, and their true conditional distributions given the query. We demonstrate
this unique intra-positive attraction and intra-negative repulsion mechanism,
which helps remove the need to assume uniform prior distributions on both the
data and their latent representation, is particularly beneficial when data sets
are less curated. Extensive large-scale experiments on a number of standard
vision tasks show that CACR not only consistently outperforms existing CL
methods on benchmark data sets in representation learning, but also shows
better robustness when generalized to pre-training on imbalanced image data
sets.

result is that, while this fails to give a compelling inflationary scenario in
the early universe, it produces naturally a phantom-like dark energy dynamics

emergent cosmological dynamics in terms of an effective equation of state, we
show that it can generically cross the phantom divide, purely out of quantum

  Clustering","25 pages, full version",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We develop new algorithmic methods with provable guarantees for feature
selection in regard to categorical data clustering. While feature selection is
one of the most common approaches to reduce dimensionality in practice, most of
the known feature selection methods are heuristics. We study the following
mathematical model. We assume that there are some inadvertent (or undesirable)
features of the input data that unnecessarily increase the cost of clustering.
Consequently, we want to select a subset of the original features from the data
such that there is a small-cost clustering on the selected features. More
precisely, for given integers $\ell$ (the number of irrelevant features) and
$k$ (the number of clusters), budget $B$, and a set of $n$ categorical data
points (represented by $m$-dimensional vectors whose elements belong to a
finite set of values $\Sigma$), we want to select $m-\ell$ relevant features
such that the cost of any optimal $k$-clustering on these features does not
exceed $B$. Here the cost of a cluster is the sum of Hamming distances
($\ell_0$-distances) between the selected features of the elements of the
cluster and its center. The clustering cost is the total sum of the costs of
the clusters. We use the framework of parameterized complexity to identify how
the complexity of the problem depends on parameters $k$, $B$, and $|\Sigma|$.
Our main result is an algorithm that solves the Feature Selection problem in
time $f(k,B,|\Sigma|)\cdot m^{g(k,|\Sigma|)}\cdot n^2$ for some functions $f$
and $g$. In other words, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized
by $B$ when $|\Sigma|$ and $k$ are constants. Our algorithm is based on a
solution to a more general problem, Constrained Clustering with Outliers. We
also complement our algorithmic findings with complexity lower bounds.

subnanokelvin temperatures and dual-species gases at densities as low as

magneto-association schemes are inefficient due to the weak coupling between
atomic and molecular states at low-densities, thus requiring extremely long
magnetic field sweeps. To address this issue we propose a modified scheme where
atoms are quenched to unitarity before proceeding with magneto-association.
This substantially improves molecular formation, allowing for up to $80\%$
efficiency, and within time-scales much shorter than those associated to atomic
and molecular losses. We show that this scheme also applies at higher
densities, therefore proving to be of interest to ground-based experiments as
well.

novel approach to investigating the galaxy main sequence that has not been
accessible to previous studies. We measure the main sequence in small mass bins
in the SFR-M$_{\star}$ plane without assuming a functional form for the main
sequence. With a large sample of galaxies in each mass bin, we isolate
star-forming galaxies by locating the transition between the star-forming and
green valley populations in the SFR-M$_{\star}$ plane. This approach eliminates
the need for arbitrarily defined fixed cutoffs when isolating the star-forming
galaxy population, which often biases measurements of the scatter around the
star-forming galaxy main sequence. We find that the main sequence for all
galaxies becomes increasingly flat towards present day at the high-mass end,
while the star-forming galaxy main sequence does not. We attribute this
difference to the increasing fraction of the collective green valley and
quiescent galaxy population from $z=3.0$ to $z=1.5$. Additionally, we measure
the total scatter around the star-forming galaxy main sequence and find that it
is $\sim0.5-1.0$ dex with little evolution as a function of mass or redshift.

the ratio of two densities $\rho_{\rm sca}/\rho_{\pi}$, we obtain an empirical
relation $f_{\Delta \nu}$ between the asteroseismic large frequency separation

This expression for main-sequence (MS) and subgiant stars with $K$-band

best results for about 3500 red giants (RGs) by using 2MASS data and model
values for $f_{\Delta \nu}$ from Sharma et al. Another unknown scaling
parameter $f_{\nu_{\rm max}}$ comes from the relationship between the frequency
of maximum amplitude and gravity. Using different combinations of $f_{\nu_{\rm
max}}$ and the parallax offset, we find that the parallax offset is generally a
function of distance. The situation where this slope disappears is accepted as
the most reasonable solution. By a very careful comparison of asteroseismic and
non-asteroseismic parameters, we obtain very precise values for the parallax
offset and $f_{\nu_{\rm max}}$ for RGs of $-0.0463\pm0.0007$ mas and

frequencies have an important role in the determination of fundamental stellar
parameters; in the literature, the relations between the two is established by
the so-called scaling relations. % These scaling relations are in better
agreement with mass and radius of main-sequence stars with large separation

  The main purpose of the study is to determine very precisely the fundamental
parameters of evolved stars by constructing interior models using asteroseismic
parameters. We also fit the reference frequencies of models to the
observational reference frequencies caused by the He {\scriptsize II}
ionization zone.

based on conventional and modified scaling relations and evolutionary models

increase the accuracy of asteroseismic radius, mass, and age. The typical
uncertainties of mass and radius are $\sim$ 3-6 and $\sim$ 1-2 per cent,

classical light field that interacts with a quantum particle remains almost
unchanged and thus contains nearly no information about the manipulated
particles. To investigate the validity of this assumption, we develop and
theoretically analyze a simple Gedankenexperiment which involves the
interaction of a coherent state with a quantum particle in an optical cavity.
We quantify the resulting alteration of the light field by measuring the
fidelity of its initial and equilibrium states. Using Bayesian inference, we
demonstrate the information transfer through photon measurements. In addition,
we employ the concepts of quantum entropy and mutual information to quantify
the entropy transfer from the particle to the light field. In the weak coupling
limit, we validate the usually assumed negligible alteration of the light field
and entropy transfer. In the strong coupling limit, however, we observe that
the information of the initial particle state can be fully encoded in the light
field, even for large photon numbers. Nevertheless, we show that spontaneous
emission is a sufficient mechanism for removing the entropy initially stored in
the particle. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the entropy
exchange between quantum matter and classical light.

data. In this paper, we propose meta-learning kernels with random Fourier
features for few-shot learning, we call MetaKernel. Specifically, we propose
learning variational random features in a data-driven manner to obtain
task-specific kernels by leveraging the shared knowledge provided by related
tasks in a meta-learning setting. We treat the random feature basis as the
latent variable, which is estimated by variational inference. The shared
knowledge from related tasks is incorporated into a context inference of the
posterior, which we achieve via a long-short term memory module. To establish
more expressive kernels, we deploy conditional normalizing flows based on
coupling layers to achieve a richer posterior distribution over random Fourier
bases. The resultant kernels are more informative and discriminative, which
further improves the few-shot learning. To evaluate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on both few-shot image classification and regression
tasks. A thorough ablation study demonstrates that the effectiveness of each
introduced component in our method. The benchmark results on fourteen datasets
demonstrate MetaKernel consistently delivers at least comparable and often
better performance than state-of-the-art alternatives.

jointly learned by a shared learning algorithm, such as a DNN. MTL is based on
the assumption that the tasks under consideration are related; therefore it
exploits shared knowledge for improving performance on each individual task.
Tasks are generally considered to be homogeneous, i.e., to refer to the same
type of problem. Moreover, MTL is usually based on ground truth annotations
with full, or partial overlap across tasks. In this work, we deal with
heterogeneous MTL, simultaneously addressing detection, classification &
regression problems. We explore task-relatedness as a means for co-training, in
a weakly-supervised way, tasks that contain little, or even non-overlapping
annotations. Task-relatedness is introduced in MTL, either explicitly through
prior expert knowledge, or through data-driven studies. We propose a novel
distribution matching approach, in which knowledge exchange is enabled between
tasks, via matching of their predictions' distributions. Based on this
approach, we build FaceBehaviorNet, the first framework for large-scale face
analysis, by jointly learning all facial behavior tasks. We develop case
studies for: i) continuous affect estimation, action unit detection, basic
emotion recognition; ii) attribute detection, face identification.
  We illustrate that co-training via task relatedness alleviates negative
transfer. Since FaceBehaviorNet learns features that encapsulate all aspects of
facial behavior, we conduct zero-/few-shot learning to perform tasks beyond the
ones that it has been trained for, such as compound emotion recognition. By
conducting a very large experimental study, utilizing 10 databases, we
illustrate that our approach outperforms, by large margins, the
state-of-the-art in all tasks and in all databases, even in these which have

The beam--field interaction is formulated as a dynamical interaction whose
stationarity according to Hamilton's principle will naturally lead to
steady-state solutions that indicate how a cavity's resonant frequency, $Q$ and
optimal coupling coefficient will detune as a result of the beam loading. A
driven cavity Lagrangian is derived from first principles, including the
effects of cavity wall losses, input power and beam interaction. The general
formulation is applied to a typical klystron input cavity to predict the
appropriate detuning parameters required to maximize the gain (or modulation
depth) in the average Lorentz factor boost, $\langle \Delta\gamma \rangle$.
Numerical examples are presented, showing agreement with the general detuning
trends previously observed in the literature. The developed formulation carries
several advantages for beam-loaded cavity structures. It provides a
self-consistent model for the dynamical (nonlinear) beam--field interaction, a
procedure for maximizing gain under beam-loading conditions, and a useful set
of parameters to guide cavity-shape optimization during the design of
beam-loaded systems. Enhanced clarity of the physical picture underlying the
problem seems to be gained using this approach, allowing straightforward
inclusion or exclusion of different field configurations in the calculation and
expressing the final results in terms of measurable quantities. Two field
configurations are discussed for the klystron input cavity, using finite
magnetic confinement or no confinement at all. Formulating the problem in a
language that is directly accessible to the powerful techniques found in
Hamiltonian dynamics and canonical transformations may potentially carry an
additional advantage in terms of analytical computational gains, under suitable
conditions.

  Both positive and negative (algorithmic) results emerge in this setting. On
the positive side, among other results, we prove that the order of elements,
the set of orders (called spectrum), and the set of preorders (\ie the set of
elements of a given order) \wrt finitely generated subgroups are always
computable in free and free times free-abelian groups. On the negative side, we
provide examples of groups and subgroups having essentially any subset of
natural numbers as relative spectrum; in particular, non-recursive and even
non-recursively enumerable sets of natural numbers. Also, we take advantage of
Mikhailova's construction to see that the spectrum membership problem is

variation of dynamic descriptions and control laws from phase to phase for
human gait is making difficult to predict the bipedal walk states. We have
designed the cellular automata rules which will predict the next gait state of
bipedal steps based on the previous two neighbour states. We have designed
cellular automata rules for normal walk. The state prediction will help to
correctly design the bipedal walk. The normal walk depends on next two states
and has total 8 states. We have considered the current and previous states to
predict next state. So we have formulated 16 rules using cellular automata, 8
rules for each leg. The priority order maintained using the fact that if right
leg in swing phase then left leg will be in stance phase. To validate the model

happens through a narrow bus with high latency and limited bandwidth, and the
low data reuse in memory-bound workloads is insufficient to amortize the cost
of main memory access. Fundamentally addressing this data movement bottleneck
requires a paradigm where the memory system assumes an active role in computing
by integrating processing capabilities. This paradigm is known as
processing-in-memory (PIM).
  Recent research explores different forms of PIM architectures, motivated by
the emergence of new 3D-stacked memory technologies that integrate memory with

evaluate these architectures in simulation or, at best, with simplified

of the generated text, existing solutions typically learn to copy entities or
triples from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, they lack overall consideration
to select and arrange the incorporated knowledge, which tends to cause text
incoherence.
  To address the above issue, we focus on improving entity-centric coherence of
the generated reviews by leveraging the semantic structure of KGs. In this
paper, we propose a novel Coherence Enhanced Text Planning model (CETP) based
on knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve both global and local coherence for review
generation. The proposed model learns a two-level text plan for generating a
document: (1) the document plan is modeled as a sequence of sentence plans in
order, and (2) the sentence plan is modeled as an entity-based subgraph from
KG. Local coherence can be naturally enforced by KG subgraphs through
intra-sentence correlations between entities. For global coherence, we design a
hierarchical self-attentive architecture with both subgraph- and node-level
attention to enhance the correlations between subgraphs. To our knowledge, we
are the first to utilize a KG-based text planning model to enhance text
coherence for review generation. Extensive experiments on three datasets
confirm the effectiveness of our model on improving the content coherence of

interdependencies. In this new architecture, features of the template image is
processed by a self-attention module in the encoder part to learn strong
context information, which is then sent to the decoder part to compute
cross-attention with the search image features processed by another
self-attention module. In addition, we design the classification and regression
heads using the output of Transformer to localize target based on
shape-agnostic anchor. We extensively evaluate our tracker TrTr, on VOT2018,

from poor generalization performance due to the greedy exploitation of
correlations among the training data, which are not stable under distributional

generalization have been proposed by leveraging multiple training environments
to find invariant relationships. However, modern datasets are frequently
assembled by merging data from multiple sources without explicit source labels.
The resultant unobserved heterogeneity renders many invariant learning methods
inapplicable. In this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Risk Minimization (HRM)
framework to achieve joint learning of latent heterogeneity among the data and

applications, their large model size and extensive floating-point operations
render deployment on mobile computing platforms a major challenge, and, in
particular, on Internet of Things devices. One appealing solution is model
quantization that reduces the model size and uses integer operations commonly
supported by microcontrollers . To this end, a 1-bit quantized DNN model or
deep binary neural network maximizes the memory efficiency, where each
parameter in a BNN model has only 1-bit. In this paper, we propose a
reconfigurable BNN (RBNN) to further amplify the memory efficiency for
resource-constrained IoT devices. Generally, the RBNN can be reconfigured on
demand to achieve any one of M (M>1) distinct tasks with the same parameter
set, thus only a single task determines the memory requirements. In other
words, the memory utilization is improved by times M. Our extensive experiments
corroborate that up to seven commonly used tasks can co-exist (the value of M
can be larger). These tasks with a varying number of classes have no or
negligible accuracy drop-off on three binarized popular DNN architectures
including VGG, ResNet, and ReActNet. The tasks span across different domains,
e.g., computer vision and audio domains validated herein, with the prerequisite
that the model architecture can serve those cross-domain tasks. To protect the
intellectual property of an RBNN model, the reconfiguration can be controlled
by both a user key and a device-unique root key generated by the intrinsic
hardware fingerprint. By doing so, an RBNN model can only be used per paid user
per authorized device, thus benefiting both the user and the model provider.

(LGRBs) are associated with the end states of very massive stars, while short
GRBs (SGRBs) are linked to the merger of compact objects. GRB 200826A was a
peculiar event, because by definition it was a SGRB, with a rest-frame duration
of ~ 0.5 s. However, this event was energetic and soft, which is consistent
with LGRBs. The relatively low redshift (z = 0.7486) motivated a comprehensive,
multi-wavelength follow-up campaign to characterize its host, search for a
possible associated supernova (SN), and thus understand the origin of this
burst. To this aim we obtained a combination of deep near-infrared (NIR) and
optical imaging together with spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals an optical and
NIR bump in the light curve whose luminosity and evolution is in agreement with
several LGRB-SNe. Analysis of the prompt GRB shows that this event follows the
$E_{\rm p,i}-E_{\rm iso}$ relation found for LGRBs. The host galaxy is a
low-mass star-forming galaxy, typical for LGRBs, but with one of the highest
star-formation rates (SFR), especially with respect to its mass ($\log
M_\ast/M_\odot = 8.6$, SFR $\sim 4.0 \,M_\odot$/yr). We conclude that GRB
200826A is a typical collapsar event in the low tail of the duration
distribution of LGRBs. These findings support theoretical predictions that
events produced by collapsars can be as short as 0.5 s in the host frame and
further confirm that duration alone is not an efficient discriminator for the
progenitor class of a GRB.

emitted from independent sources are distributed among the agents, and the
correlations across the entire network can be derived from each agent's local
measurements on the shared composite quantum systems. To reveal the Bell
non-locality in such cases as a quantum feature, minimal knowledge of the
emitted stabilizer state is required. Here, we demonstrate that knowing the
stabilizing and logical operators indeed provides a new way of exploring Bell
non-locality in quantum networks. For the qubit distribution in quantum
networks, the associated nonlinear Bell inequalities are derived. On the other
hand, to violate these inequalities, one can design local incompatible
observables using minimal knowledge of the emitted states. The tilted nonlinear
Bell inequalities tailored for specific non-maximal entangled stabilizer states
and a way of achieving the maximal violation are also explored.

instances of small antennas. Each design instance is conditioned on a target
radiation pattern and is required to conform to specific spatial dimensions and
to include, as part of its metallic structure, a set of predetermined
locations. The solution, in the case of a single antenna, is based on a
composite neural network that combines a simulation network, a hypernetwork,
and a refinement network. In the design of the antenna array, we add an
additional design level and employ a hypernetwork within a hypernetwork. The
learning objective is based on measuring the similarity of the obtained
radiation pattern to the desired one. Our experiments demonstrate that our
approach is able to design novel antennas and antenna arrays that are compliant
with the design requirements, considerably better than the baseline methods. We
compare the solutions obtained by our method to existing designs and
demonstrate a high level of overlap. When designing the antenna array of a

sequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively,
which causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A
straightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive
(NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model
for ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly
increased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns
and correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR,
we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit
alignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output
sentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence
based on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and
extracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during
edition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to
adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for
parallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length
predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation.
Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale
ASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1)
it speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER
reduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it
outperforms the popular NAR models adopted in neural machine translation and
text edition by a large margin.

free-surface deformation by various centrifuge degrees can be systematically
examined using this apparatus. In the system, a small unit consisting of a

deformation of a rotated water surface is first measured and analyzed. The

show the significant deformation of granular pile and finally develop steep
granular slopes on the side walls. However, details of the deformation

spectroscopy (RAS), which directly depends on the complex dielectric function,

Studying the strain-induced symmetry breaking in copper, we show how uniaxial

transitions, directly observable in RAS. We corroborate our experimental
results by analysing the strain-induced changes in the electronic structure

up the possibility to gain a direct insight on the band-structure of other

massive gravity (MTMVMG) where the masslike scalar potential is coupled to a
vielbein potential, unlike in the previous literature where it is coupled to
metric, such that the number of graviton degrees of freedom in the theory is
the same as in general relativity. We then study the cosmological aspects of
this theory and show that it has eight critical points: five in the massless
sector and three in the massive sector. In contrast to the standard theory of
mass-varying massive gravity where the graviton mass asymptotically approaches
zero at late times, hence making the contribution of massive gravity to the
late-time cosmic expansion minimum, the MTMVMG can provide good descriptions
both in the massless and massive sectors. Especially, there are at least two
interesting possible scenarios for the late-time cosmology in the theory: the
dark energy is either due to the constant graviton mass which comes from the
scalar field that becomes frozen after the reheating era, or due to the
quintessence paradigm where the scalar field is dynamic. Therefore, if the
accelerating expansion of the universe in the massless sector can be explained
by standard quintessence paradigm, in the massive sector it has to be explained
by the nontrivial interplay between quintessence and massive gravity.

Transmission Electron Microscope. In practice, we will take projection images
at zone axes, because of its symmetric high-density diffractions associated
with flat Ewald sphere and minimum overlap with the neighboring molecules. By
precessing the illuminating beam around the zone axis, and introducing annular
objective aperture, we select only the kinematic Bragg diffractions which
correctly contribute to the real image reconstruction on the 2D electron
detector. The outcome should be a positive contrast, clean image with no
dynamical diffractions nor Moir\'e patterns. Importantly, the image should be
insensitive to the defocus, and the spatial resolution may not be limited by
the spherical and the chromatic aberrations of objective lens. Therefore, the
imaging of small molecules, such as, the drug structure will be
straightforward. By taking multiple projection images at the different zone
axes from many micro-crystals, or from surrounding thin edges of a large

field of data mining. Imbalanced data substantially affects the performance of
standard classification models. Data-level approaches mainly use the
oversampling methods to solve the problem, such as synthetic minority
oversampling Technique (SMOTE). However, since the methods such as SMOTE
generate instances by linear interpolation, synthetic data space may look like
a polygonal. Also, the oversampling methods generate outliers of the minority
class. In this paper, we proposed Gaussian based minority oversampling
technique (GMOTE) with a statistical perspective for imbalanced datasets. To
avoid linear interpolation and to consider outliers, this proposed method
generates instances by the Gaussian Mixture Model. Motivated by
clustering-based multivariate Gaussian outlier score (CMGOS), we propose to
adapt tail probability of instances through the Mahalanobis distance to
consider local outliers. The experiment was carried out on a representative set
of benchmark datasets. The performance of the GMOTE is compared with other
methods such as SMOTE. When the GMOTE is combined with classification and
regression tree (CART) or support vector machine (SVM), it shows better
accuracy and F1-Score. Experimental results demonstrate the robust performance.

alignment among different users. However, due to the inherent characteristics
of LEO satellite communication systems, e.g., wide beam coverage and long

location-based TA estimation for 5G integrated LEO satellite communication

difference of arrival (FDOA) measurements in the downlink timing and frequency
synchronization phase, which are made from the satellite at different time

formulated as a quadratic optimization problem whose globally optimal solution
can be obtained by a quadratic penalty algorithm. To reduce the computational
complexity, we further propose an alternative approximation method based on
iteratively performing a linearization procedure on the quadratic equality

of the data to lower frequencies. First is an extension of the autoregressive

of acoustic signals from two independent recording systems were compared by
principal component analysis. In parallel, changes in water potential, branch
diameter, loss of hydraulic conductance and electrolyte leakage were measured
to quantify drought-induced damages. Two distinct phases of acoustic emissions
were observed during dehydration: the first one associated with a rapid loss of
diameter and a significant increase in loss of xylem conductance (90%) and the
second one with a significant increase in electrolyte leakage and slower
diameter changes. This second phase corresponds to a complete loss of recovery
capacity. The acoustic signals of both phases were discriminated by the third

first acoustic phase suggests the hydraulic origin of these signals (i.e.
cavitation events). For the second phase, the signals showed much higher
variability between plants and acoustic systems suggesting that the sources of
these signals may be plural, although likely including cellular damage. A
simple algorithm was developed to discriminate hydraulic-related acoustic
signals from other sources, allowing the reconstruction of dynamic hydraulic

a domain-transition design paradigm, where three modules including pixel-level
texture complexity evaluation, DCT feature extraction, and mode-wise

extracting useful features from a decompressed JPEG image and converting them
into embedding policies for DCT elements, while considering JPEG
characteristics including inter-block and intra-block correlations
simultaneously. The environment network is designed in a gradient-oriented way
to provide stable reward values by using a wide architecture equipped with a

method that is computationally intractable for large-scale problems. The
truncated power method proposed recently provides us with another idea to solve
this problem, however, its accuracy and efficiency can be poor in practical
computations. In this work, we revisit the higher-order PageRank problem and
consider how to solve it efficiently. The contribution of this work is as
follows. First, we accelerate the truncated power method for high-order
PageRank. In the improved version, it is neither to form and store the vectors
arising from the dangling states, nor to store an auxiliary matrix. Second, we
propose a truncated power method with partial updating to further release the
overhead, in which one only needs to update some important columns of the
approximation in each iteration. On the other hand, the truncated power method
solves a modified high-order PageRank model for convenience, which is not
mathematically equivalent to the original one. Thus, the third contribution of
this work is to propose a sparse power method with partial updating for the
original higher-order PageRank problem. The convergence of all the proposed
methods are discussed. Numerical experiments on large and sparse real-world and
synthetic data sets are performed. The numerical results show the superiority
of our new algorithms over some state-of-the-art ones for large and sparse
higher-order PageRank problems.

approach does not require iterations during the sampling interval. It only
needs to perform a single one-step calculation at each interval to obtain the
evolution of the optimal trajectory, which demonstrates fast calculation and
online-tracking capability with an asymptotically vanishing error.
Specifically, the designed approach contains two terms: a prediction term
tracking the change in the optimal solution based on the time-varying nature of
system power, and a correction term pushing the solution toward the optimum
based on Newton's method. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be applied in
the absence of an accurate network model by leveraging voltage measurements to
identify the true voltage sensitivity parameters. Simulations for an

symmetric underlying action the sector of the standard model (SM) and its
mirror copy have the same SU(2)\times U(1) gauge structure and parameters; the
mirror fermion counter-partners have opposite chiralities. A theory is used
that allows one to obtain MESM in Minkowski space only if we start with an
accurate account of gravity and only at the end go to the limit of Minkowski
space. Spontaneous breaking of left-right symmetry and the ""wrong"" sign in the
mass terms of the Higgs fields potentials arise due to the initial conditions
imposed on the T-model inflation. MESM allows choosing the universal Yukawa
coupling constant $y$ in the underlying Lagrangian for all generations of
charged leptons and up-quarks. As an example, with y=10^{-3}, it is shown that
a set of additional dimensionless parameters in width range less than 0.5 is
sufficient to obtain the masses of all known charged leptons and up-quarks. In
this sense, MESM bypasses the problem of the fermion mass hierarchy. With this
choice of parameters, MESM predicts that vacuum expectation value for the
mirror Higgs field is 10^{14}GeV and masses of mirror particles are in the
range 10^{8}GeV-10^{14}GeV. There is only gravitational interaction between
particles of the SM and mirror sectors. Hence, mirror particles can constitute
dark matter. The vacuum is realized as a limiting state in the cosmological
evolution of the inflaton and classical Higgs fields, in which the energy
stored in them becomes minimal, providing the maximum possible contribution of
these fields to the entropy of the Universe. If further study of the model
reveals the existence of an effective mechanism for preheating the Universe,
this will mean that the cosmological constant problem is absent.

dynamic oxygen migrations - hydroxyl and epoxy migrations - are achieved by the
breaking/reforming of C-O bond reaction and the proton transfer reaction. It is
demonstrated that the spontaneously dynamic characteristic is attributed to the
sharply reduced energy barrier less than or comparable to thermal fluctuations.
We also observe a stable intermediate state with a dangling C-O bond, which
permits the successive migration of oxygen functional groups. However, on the
exterior surface of SWCNT, the oxygen groups are difficult to migrate
spontaneously due to the relatively high energy barriers, and the dangling C-O
bond prefers to transform into the more stable epoxy configuration. The
spontaneous oxygen migration is further confirmed by the long-distance oxygen
migration, which comprises three hydroxyl migration reactions and one C-O bond
reaction. Our work provides a new understanding of the behavior of oxygen
functional groups on interfaces and gives a potential route to design new
carbon-based dynamic materials.

insignificant (in terms of the total magnetic flux of pre-existing AR)

fabricated high-quality single crystals of Co3Sn2S2-xSex (x = 0, 0.26, & 0.86).
The Se-substitution is intended to broaden the distance between Co atoms. For
each Se-composition, magnetizations of single-crystalline Co3Sn2S2-xSex
implicate that the magnetic ground state consists of the out-of-plane
ferromagnetism and the in-plane antiferromagnetism: Being degenerate.
Meanwhile, along out-of-plane, remanent magnetizations of Co3Sn2S2-xSex have a
first-order phase transition, so Co3Sn2S2-xSex owns an excited magnetic state,
denoted as the metastable state. Consequently, we have provided semiclassical
magnetic structures of the degenerate ground state and the metastable state via
both magnetic symmetries and experimental constraints. Moreover, we have
discovered mechanisms raising degeneracy and metastability.

in a complex, dynamic and stochastic environment. But they are computationally
expensive to execute and optimize, due to lack of analytical tractability.
Simulation optimization is concerned with developing efficient sampling schemes
-- subject to a computational budget -- to solve such optimization problems. To
mitigate the computational burden, surrogates are often constructed using
simulation outputs to approximate the response surface of the simulation model.
In this tutorial, we provide an up-to-date overview of surrogate-based methods
for simulation optimization with continuous decision variables. Typical
surrogates, including linear basis function models and Gaussian processes, are
introduced. Surrogates can be used either as a local approximation or a global
approximation. Depending on the choice, one may develop algorithms that
converge to either a local optimum or a global optimum. Representative examples
are presented for each category. Recent advances in large-scale computation for
Gaussian processes are also discussed.

With a current along the c axis of Fe5Sn3, the transverse resistivity curves

related to the noncoplanar spin structure in Fe5Sn3. This spin structure
induced nonzero scalar spin chirality, which acted as fictitious magnetic

research has focused on health applications as a result of which the gut
microbiome has been implicated in the development of a broad range of diseases
such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and major depressive disorder. A
key goal of many microbiome experiments is to characterise or describe the
microbial community. High-throughput sequencing is used to generate microbiota
profiles, but data gathered via this method are extremely challenging to
analyse, as the data violate multiple strong assumptions of standard models.
Rough Set Theory (RST) has weak assumptions that are less likely to be
violated, and offers a range of attractive tools for extracting knowledge from
complex data. In this paper we present the first application of RST for
characterising microbiomes. We begin with a demonstrative benchmark microbiota
profile and extend the approach to gut microbiomes gathered from depressed
subjects to enable knowledge discovery. We find that RST is capable of
excellent characterisation of the gut microbiomes in depressed subjects and
identifying previously undescribed alterations to the microbiome-gut-brain
axis. An important aspect of the application of RST is that it provides a
possible solution to an open research question regarding the search for an
optimal normalisation approach for microbiome census data, as one does not
currently exist.

RXCJ1504.1-0248 and Abell 1664 for gas above 0.7 keV, respectively. These
cooling rates are higher than the star formation rates observed in the
clusters, and support simultaneous star formation and molecular gas mass growth
on a timescale of 3$\times 10^8$ yr or longer. At these rates, the energy of
the X-ray cooling gas is inadequate to power the observed UV/optical
line-emitting nebulae, which suggests additional strong heating. No significant
residual cooling is detected below 0.7 keV in RXCJ1504.1-0248. By
simultaneously fitting the first and second order spectra, we place an upper
limit on turbulent velocity of 300 km$\rm s^{-1}$ at 90 per cent confidence
level for the soft X-ray emitting gas in both clusters. The turbulent energy
density is considered to be less than 8.9 and 27 per cent of the thermal energy
density in RXCJ1504.1-0248 and Abell 1664, respectively. This means it is
insufficient for AGN heating to fully propagate throughout the cool core via
turbulence. We find the cool X-ray component of Abell 1664 ($\sim$0.8 keV) is
blueshifted from the systemic velocity by 750$^{+800}_{-280}$ km$\rm s^{-1}$.
This is consistent with one component of the molecular gas in the core and
suggests a similar dynamical structure for the two phases. We find that an
intrinsic absorption model allows the cooling rate to increase to $520\pm 30\,
\rm M_{\odot}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ in RXCJ1504.1-0248.

With the rapid developments of machine learning techniques, especially deep

prediction application with fast gradient sign method attack. The mean square

we reveal another such shortcut, whereby recognizers overly depend on local
image statistics. Motivated by this, we suggest an approach to regulate the
reliance on local statistics that improves text recognition performance.
  Our method, termed TextAdaIN, creates local distortions in the feature map
which prevent the network from overfitting to local statistics. It does so by
viewing each feature map as a sequence of elements and deliberately mismatching
fine-grained feature statistics between elements in a mini-batch. Despite
TextAdaIN's simplicity, extensive experiments show its effectiveness compared
to other, more complicated methods. TextAdaIN achieves state-of-the-art results
on standard handwritten text recognition benchmarks. It generalizes to multiple

demonstrate that integrating TextAdaIN improves robustness towards more

adapt to new problems. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) have emerged as a
popular modeling framework by removing the need for ML practitioners to choose
the number of layers in a recurrent model. While we can control the
computational cost by choosing the number of layers in standard architectures,
in NDEs the number of neural network evaluations for a forward pass can depend
on the number of steps of the adaptive ODE solver. But, can we force the NDE to
learn the version with the least steps while not increasing the training cost?
Current strategies to overcome slow prediction require high order automatic
differentiation, leading to significantly higher training time. We describe a
novel regularization method that uses the internal cost heuristics of adaptive
differential equation solvers combined with discrete adjoint sensitivities to
guide the training process towards learning NDEs that are easier to solve. This
approach opens up the blackbox numerical analysis behind the differential
equation solver's algorithm and directly uses its local error estimates and
stiffness heuristics as cheap and accurate cost estimates. We incorporate our
method without any change in the underlying NDE framework and show that our
method extends beyond Ordinary Differential Equations to accommodate Neural
Stochastic Differential Equations. We demonstrate how our approach can halve
the prediction time and, unlike other methods which can increase the training

agent-based model, which we set up, complemented by the hydrodynamic theory for
the system. We demonstrate that this system can phase-synchronize without any
hydrodynamic interactions. Our combined numerical and analytical studies show
that this model, when stable, displays hitherto unstudied scaling behavior: As
a consequence of the interplay between the mobility, active rotation and number
conservation, such a system can be stable over a wide range of the model
parameters characterized by a novel correspondence between the phase and
density fluctuations. In different regions of the phase space where the
phase-ordered system is stable, it shows phase ordering which is generically
either logarithmically stronger than the conventional quasi long range order
(QLRO) found in its equilibrium limit, together with ""miniscule number
fluctuations"", or logarithmically weaker than QLRO along with ""giant number
fluctuations"", showing a novel one-to-one correspondence between phase ordering
and density fluctuations in the ordered states. Intriguingly, these scaling
exponents are found to depend explicitly on the model parameters. We further
show that in other parameter regimes there are no stable, ordered phases.
Instead, two distinct types of disordered states with short range phase-order
are found, characterized by the presence or absence of stable clusters of

and transmits it to the receiver, who then attempts to guess a randomly chosen

security. Identification of infected fishes in aquaculture remains challenging
to find out at the early stage due to the dearth of necessary infrastructure.
The identification of infected fish timely is an obligatory step to thwart from
spreading disease. In this work, we want to find out the salmon fish disease in
aquaculture, as salmon aquaculture is the fastest-growing food production
system globally, accounting for 70 percent (2.5 million tons) of the market. In
the alliance of flawless image processing and machine learning mechanism, we
identify the infected fishes caused by the various pathogen. This work divides
into two portions. In the rudimentary portion, image pre-processing and
segmentation have been applied to reduce noise and exaggerate the image,
respectively. In the second portion, we extract the involved features to
classify the diseases with the help of the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithm of machine learning with a kernel function. The processed images of
the first portion have passed through this (SVM) model. Then we harmonize a
comprehensive experiment with the proposed combination of techniques on the
salmon fish image dataset used to examine the fish disease. We have conveyed
this work on a novel dataset compromising with and without image augmentation.
The results have bought a judgment of our applied SVM performs notably with
91.42 and 94.12 percent of accuracy, respectively, with and without
augmentation.

bright X-ray and optical flares. Here we present a detailed spectral study of
its second brightest X-ray flare observed during 2019-2020 using archival Swift
and NuSTAR observations along with ToO observations from AstroSat. The entire
flaring period is divided into three states, defined as low, intermediate, and
high states. The variation of hardness ratio (HR) with 0.3-10.0 keV integrated
flux suggests a \enquote{softer-when-brighter} behavior, as also previously
reported based on flux-index variations. Simultaneous high state X-ray spectra
obtained using Swift, NuSTAR and AstroSat are very steep with a power-law index
$>$2. A significant spectral change is observed in AstroSat-SXT and LAXPC
spectrum which is consistent with Swift-XRT and NuSTAR spectrum. Together,
optical-UV and X-ray spectrum during the high flux state, suggesting the
emergence of a new high BL Lacertae (HBL) component. We have modeled the
synchrotron peak with publicly available code named GAMERA for low,
intermediate, and high flux state. Our modeling suggests the need of high
magnetic field to explain the high state under the leptonic scenarios. Increase
in the magnetic field value inside the jet could be linked to the increase in
accretion rate as expected in the BH-disk impact scenario. The color-magnitude
diagram reveals a \enquote{bluer-when-brighter} spectral energy distribution
chromatism during the flaring period. Different chromatism or no chromatism at
various occasions suggests a complex origin of optical emission, which is
believed to be produced by disc impact or through synchrotron emission in the

privacy-utility trade-off is controlled by parameters $\epsilon$ and $k$,
regulating the per-update privacy budget and the number of $\epsilon$-LDP
gradient updates sent by each user respectively. To further protect the user's

anonymizing and shuffling the reports before forwarding them to the
recommender. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on
the MovieLens dataset, achieving up to Hit Ratio with K=10 (HR@10) 0.68 on 50k
users with 5k items. Even on the full dataset, we show that it is possible to
achieve reasonable utility with HR@10>0.5 without compromising user privacy.

hole picture, that once an excitation crosses the horizon, it is lost forever
from the outside world. Deeper implications of this phenomenon are speculated.

transition will not happen in case of the Gaussian--type gluon model without

which allows for speed without sacrificing generality. We show that by
formalizing a generic API on actions independent of implementation, we can
retroactively add optimized data structures to our system without changing the
pre-existing term rewriters. We showcase how this can be used to optimize term

Further, we show that such a generic API allows for complementary

simplifiers. We showcase an e-graph ruleset which minimizes the number of CPU

species and complex social phenomena. Zero-determinant (ZD) strategies in
repeated games discovered by Press and Dyson in 2012 enforce a linear payoff
relationship between a focal player and the opponent. This linear relationship
can be set arbitrarily by a ZD player. Hence, a subclass of ZD strategies can
fix the opponent's expected payoff and another subclass of the strategies can
exceed the opponent for the expected payoff. Since this discovery, theories for
ZD strategies are extended to cope with various natural situations. It is
especially important to consider the theory of ZD strategies for repeated games
with a discount factor and observation errors because it allows the theory to
be applicable in the real world. Recent studies revealed their existence of ZD
strategies even in repeated games with both factors. However, the conditions
for the existence has not been sufficiently analyzed. Here, we mathematically
analyzed the conditions in repeated games with both factors. First, we derived
the thresholds of a discount factor and observation errors which ensure the
existence of Equalizer and positively correlated ZD (pcZD) strategies, which
are well-known subclasses of ZD strategies. We found that ZD strategies exist
only when a discount factor remains high as the error rates increase. Next, we
derived the conditions for the expected payoff of the opponent enforced by
Equalizer as well as the conditions for the slope and base line payoff of
linear lines enforced by pcZD. As a result, we found that, as error rates

develop the Musielak-Orlicz-Gauss image problem aiming to characterize the
Musielak-Orlicz-Gauss image measure of convex bodies. For a convex body $K$,
its Musielak-Orlicz-Gauss image measure, denoted by $\widetilde{C}_{\Theta}(K,
\cdot)$, involves a triple $\Theta=(G, \Psi, \lambda)$ where $G$ and $\Psi$ are
two Musielak-Orlicz functions defined on $S^{n-1}\times (0, \infty)$ and
$\lambda$ is a nonzero finite Lebesgue measure on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$.
Such a measure can be produced by a variational formula of $\widetilde{V}_{G,
\lambda}(K)$ (the general dual volume of $K$ with respect to $\lambda$) under
the perturbations of $K$ by the Musielak-Orlicz addition defined via the
function $\Psi$. The Musielak-Orlicz-Gauss image problem contains many
intensively studied Minkowski type problems and the recent Gauss image problem
as its special cases. Under the condition that $G$ is decreasing on its second

good approach for low-resource languages; however, its performance will be
greatly limited when there are unseen languages in the translation pairs. In
this paper, we present a continual pre-training (CPT) framework on mBART to
effectively adapt it to unseen languages. We first construct noisy
mixed-language text from the monolingual corpus of the target language in the
translation pair to cover both the source and target languages, and then, we
continue pre-training mBART to reconstruct the original monolingual text.
Results show that our method can consistently improve the fine-tuning
performance upon the mBART baseline, as well as other strong baselines, across
all tested low-resource translation pairs containing unseen languages.
Furthermore, our approach also boosts the performance on translation pairs
where both languages are seen in the original mBART's pre-training. The code is

parameters of the spatial boundaries, algorithmic factors related to the

factors are the update methods and the size of the time step. Model parameters
cover several parameters describing the level of motivation, the strength and

solutions often use shallow machine learning models with raw positional data or
manually extracted features to achieve this. However, gait is composed of many
highly expressive characteristics that can be used to identify human subjects,
and most solutions fail to address this, disregarding the subject's privacy.
This work introduces a novel deep neural network architecture to disentangle

the subject's privacy is preserved while the affect recognition performance
outperforms traditional methods. Furthermore, we exploit Guided Grad-CAM to
provide global explanations of the model's decision across gait cycles. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our method to existing methods at recognizing

We also show that this data can easily be exploited to expose a subject's

the high configuration entropy larger than 1.5R (R is the gas constant), which

broadened phonon-assisted wide-band radiation (BPAWR). The subsequent
low-threshold self-absorption coherence modulation (SACM) was also observed in
the HEGS, modulated by changing excitation wavelengths, sample size, and doping
concentrations. The time delay of the BPAWR signal is up to 1.66 ns relative to
the zero-delay signal, while the time delay of the Raman process is typically

nodal point phonons, nodal line phonons, and nodal surface phonons have been
proposed, and a handful of candidate materials have been predicted in
solid-state materials. In this work, based on symmetry analysis and
first-principles calculations, we propose that hourglass Weyl nodal line (HWNL)
phonons and Dirac nodal line (DNL) phonons coexist in the phonon dispersion of
a single material, KCuS, with a $Pnma$-type structure. The HWNLs and DNLs are
relatively flat in frequency and well separated from other phonon bands. The
corresponding topological phonon surface states appear only in the [100] and
[001] surfaces, unlike those of typical phononic nodal-line materials. The
reason for this phenomenon is explained based on Zak phase calculations. Our
work, for the first time, proves that phononic nodal lines with different types
of degeneracies can be achieved in one single material. Thus, KCuS can be
viewed as a good platform to investigate the entanglement between HWNL phonons

promote osseointegra-tion of femoral stems. Biomaterial coatings are fabricated
mostly using atmospheric plasma spray (APS). However, the conventional plasma
spray process requires hydrox-yapatite powder with good flow, and to prepare
such free-flowing powder, agglomer-ation, such as spray drying, fusing, and
crushing is used. Therefore, it is impossible to spray nano-powder using
conventional methods. Here, we designed a suspension-feeding system to feed
nanoparticles using a liquid carrier. Suspension plasma spray (SPS)
successfully deposited homogeneous HAp/Gray Titania coating with less poros-ity
on the surface of titanium substrates. The microstructure of coatings with
differ-ent compositions was then characterized using scanning electron
microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy to identify the crystal
structure. All results con-sistently demonstrated that SPS could transform Ti2
O3 into TiO2 with mixed Magneli phases, such as Ti4 O7 and Ti3 O5, which
usually show photocatalytic activity. Interfacial strength, hardness, young
modulus, and fracture toughness were also improved with a high concentration of
TiO2. Antibacterial test for E.Coli under LED light re-vealed that SPSed
HAp/Gray Titania coating could significantly enhance antibacterial properties.
The possible underlying mechanism of enhanced antibacterial properties can be
attributed to increased Magneli phases and better bacterial adhesion caused by
hydrophilic properties due to submicron size particles. SPS can fabricate
visible light-responsive antibacterial coating, which can be used for medical
devices.

We are talking about such states in which correlation functions are not
functions of such isometry invariants as geodesic distances, while having
correct UV behaviour. The reason to consider such states is the presence of IR
secular memory effects for generic time dependent backgrounds, which are

  Covid-19 as an example",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Many research papers that propose models to predict the course of the
COVID-19 pandemic either use handcrafted statistical models or large neural
networks. Even though large neural networks are more powerful than simpler
statistical models, they are especially hard to train on small datasets. This
paper not only presents a model with grater flexibility than the other proposed
neural networks, but also presents a model that is effective on smaller
datasets. To improve performance on small data, six regularisation methods were
tested. The results show that the GRU combined with 20% Dropout achieved the
lowest RMSE scores. The main finding was that models with less access to data
relied more on the regulariser. Applying Dropout to a GRU model trained on only
28 days of data reduced the RMSE by 23%.

Riemann-Liouville time-derivative of order ? 2 (0; 1) and an arbitrary positive
self-adjoint operator A is considered. This problem is ill-posed in the sense
of Hadamard due to the lack of stability of the solution. Nevertheless, we will
show that if we consider sufficiently smooth current information, then the
solution exists and it is unique. Using this result, we study the inverse
problem of initial value identification for subdiffusion equation. The results
obtained differ significantly from the corresponding results for the classical
diffusion equation (i.e. ? = 1) and even for the subdiffusion equation with the
Caputo derivative. A list of examples of operator A is discussed, including
linear systems of fractional differential equations, differential models with
involution, fractional Sturm-Liouville operators, and many others.

To appear in GSI2021",,,,"math.DG stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In information geometry, generalized exponential families and statistical
manifolds with curvature are under active investigation in recent years. In
this paper we consider the statistical manifold induced by a logarithmic
$L^{(\alpha)}$-divergence which generalizes the Bregman divergence. It is known
that such a manifold is dually projectively flat with constant negative
sectional curvature, and is closely related to the
$\mathcal{F}^{(\alpha)}$-family, a generalized exponential family introduced by
the second author. Our main result constructs a dual foliation of the
statistical manifold, i.e., an orthogonal decomposition consisting of primal
and dual autoparallel submanifolds. This decomposition, which can be naturally
interpreted in terms of primal and dual projections with respect to the
logarithmic divergence, extends the dual foliation of a dually flat manifold
studied by Amari. As an application, we formulate a new $L^{(\alpha)}$-PCA
problem which generalizes the exponential family PCA.

  the third kind","16 pages, with calculations in Sagemath",,,,"math.AG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We consider the construction of the fundamental function and Abelian
differentials of the third kind on a plane algebraic curve over the field of
complex numbers that has no singular points. The algorithm for constructing
differentials of the third kind is described in Weierstrass's Lectures. The
article discusses its implementation in the Sage computer algebra system. The
specificity of this algorithm, as well as the very concept of the differential
of the third kind, implies the use of not only rational numbers, but also
algebraic ones, even when the equation of the curve has integer coefficients.
Sage has a built-in algebraic number field tool that allows implementing
Weierstrass's algorithm almost verbatim. The simplest example of an elliptic
curve shows that it requires too many resources, going far beyond the
capabilities of an office computer. Then the symmetrization of the method is
proposed and implemented, which solves the problem and allows significant
economy of resources. The algorithm for constructing a differential of the
third kind is used to find the value of the fundamental function according to
the duality principle. Examples explored in the Sage system are provided.

  for Use in Multi-Modal Trip Navigation","8 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CY cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The novel Corona virus pandemic is one of the biggest worldwide problems
right now. While hygiene and wearing masks make up a large portion of the
currently suggested precautions by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO), social distancing is
another and arguably the most important precaution that would protect people
since the airborne virus is easily transmitted through the air. Social
distancing while walking outside, can be more effective, if pedestrians know
locations of each other and even better if they know locations of people who
are possible carriers. With this information, they can change their routes
depending on the people walking nearby or they can stay away from areas that
contain or have recently contained crowds. This paper presents a mobile device
application that would be a very beneficial tool for social distancing during
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The application works, synced close to
real-time, in a networking fashion with all users obtaining their locations and
drawing a virtual safety bubble around them. These safety bubbles are used with
the constant velocity pedestrian model to predict possible future social
distancing violations and warn the user with sound and vibration. Moreover, it
takes into account the virus staying airborne for a certain time, hence,
creating time-decaying non-safe areas in the past trajectories of the users.
The mobile app generates collision free paths for navigating around the
undesired locations for the pedestrian mode of transportation when used as part
of a multi-modal trip planning app. Results are applicable to other modes of
transportation also. Features and the methods used for implementation are
discussed in the paper. The application is tested using previously collected
real pedestrian walking data in a realistic environment.

but other factors like gender also play a role.

computation-thus in-depth studies of patterns of sentiment analysis are
necessary. At present, rich resource data-based SA has been well developed,
while the more challenging and practical multi-source unsupervised SA (i.e. a
target domain SA by transferring from multiple source domains) is seldom
studied. The challenges behind this problem mainly locate in the lack of
supervision information, the semantic gaps among domains (i.e., domain shifts),
and the loss of knowledge. However, existing methods either lack the
distinguishable capacity of the semantic gaps among domains or lose private
knowledge. To alleviate these problems, we propose a two-stage domain
adaptation framework. In the first stage, a multi-task methodology-based
shared-private architecture is employed to explicitly model the domain common
features and the domain-specific features for the labeled source domains. In
the second stage, two elaborate mechanisms are embedded in the shared private
architecture to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains. The first
mechanism is a selective domain adaptation (SDA) method, which transfers
knowledge from the closest source domain. And the second mechanism is a
target-oriented ensemble (TOE) method, in which knowledge is transferred
through a well-designed ensemble method. Extensive experiment evaluations
verify that the performance of the proposed framework outperforms unsupervised
state-of-the-art competitors. What can be concluded from the experiments is
that transferring from very different distributed source domains may degrade
the target-domain performance, and it is crucial to choose the proper source
domains to transfer from.

that put forth algorithms to efficiently manage traffic using traffic lights.
Two such algorithms are the OAF (oldest arrival first) and ITLC (intelligent
traffic light controller) algorithms. However, many traffic light algorithms do
not consider future traffic flow and therefore cannot mitigate traffic in such
a way as to reduce future traffic in the present. This paper presents the Edge
Load Management and Optimization through Pseudoflow Prediction (ELMOPP)
algorithm, which aims to solve problems detailed in previous algorithms;
through machine learning with nested long short-term memory (NLSTM) modules and
graph theory, the algorithm attempts to predict the near future using past data
and traffic patterns to inform its real-time decisions and better mitigate
traffic by predicting future traffic flow based on past flow and using those
predictions to both maximize present traffic flow and decrease future traffic
congestion. Furthermore, while ITLC and OAF require the use of GPS
transponders; and GPS, speed sensors, and radio, respectively, ELMOPP only uses
traffic light camera footage, something that is almost always readily available
in contrast to GPS and speed sensors. ELMOPP was tested against the ITLC and
OAF traffic management algorithms using a simulation modeled after the one
presented in the ITLC paper, a single-intersection simulation, and the
collected data supports the conclusion that ELMOPP statistically significantly
outperforms both algorithms in throughput rate, a measure of how many vehicles
are able to exit inroads every second.
