applying worldly context (prior knowledge) to logical negation in compositional
distributional semantics. Given a word, our framework can create its negation
that is similar to how humans perceive negation. The framework corrects logical
negation to weight meanings closer in the entailment hierarchy more than
meanings further apart. The proposed framework is flexible to accommodate
different choices of logical negations, compositions, and worldly context
generation. In particular, we propose and motivate a new logical negation using
matrix inverse.
  We validate the sensibility of our conversational negation framework by
performing experiments, leveraging density matrices to encode graded entailment
information. We conclude that the combination of subtraction negation and
phaser in the basis of the negated word yields the highest Pearson correlation
of 0.635 with human ratings.

Theorem, the dipole response of such a multi-particle system to a spatially
homogeneous probe is indistinguishable from the response of a system of
non-interacting particles. Twisted light however can excite internal degrees of
freedom, resulting in the appearance of new peaks in the even multipole
spectrum which are not present when the probe is a plane wave. We also
demonstrate the ability of the proposed twisted light probe to capture the
transition of interacting fermions into a strongly correlated regime in a
one-dimensional harmonic trap. We report that by suitable choice of the probe's
parameters, the transition into a strongly correlated phase manifests itself as
an approach and ultimate superposition of peaks in the second order quadrupole
response. These features, observed in exact calculations for two electrons, are
reproduced in adiabatic Time Dependent Density Functional Theory simulations.

specific location of the vacua. The influence of the vacuum arrangements
(evolving from three collinear vacua to three vacua placed at the vertices of
an equilateral triangle) on the kink scattering is investigated. Two different
regimes can be distinguished: in the first one, two symmetric BPS
kinks/antikinks arise whereas in the second one a new different BPS
kink/antikink emerges, with the exception of a three-fold rotational symmetry
case, where the three topological defects are identical. The scattering between
the two symmetric kinks is thoroughly analyzed. Two different scattering
channels have been found: kink-kink reflection and kink-kink hybridization. In
the last case, the collision between the two symmetric kinks gives rise to the
third different kink. Resonance phenomena also appear allowing a vibrating kink
to split into two symmetric kinks moving away.

given the fact that speech-to-translation data is scarce. But ST encoders are
not simple instances of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Machine
Translation (MT) encoders. For example, we find that ASR encoders lack the
global context representation, which is necessary for translation, whereas MT
encoders are not designed to deal with long but locally attentive acoustic
sequences. In this work, we propose a Stacked Acoustic-and-Textual Encoding
(SATE) method for speech translation. Our encoder begins with processing the
acoustic sequence as usual, but later behaves more like an MT encoder for a
global representation of the input sequence. In this way, it is straightforward
to incorporate the pre-trained models into the system. Also, we develop an
adaptor module to alleviate the representation inconsistency between the
pre-trained ASR encoder and MT encoder, and develop a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation method to preserve the pre-training knowledge. Experimental
results on the LibriSpeech En-Fr and MuST-C En-De ST tasks show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art BLEU scores of 18.3 and 25.2. To our knowledge, we

physics that has been studied either in purely conservative systems or in the
presence of weak perturbations. In many systems noise plays an important role
in the dynamical behavior and it models their internal irregularities or their
coupling with the environment. In these situations the unpredictability is
affected by both the chaotic dynamics and the stochastic fluctuations. In the
presence of noise two trajectories with the same initial condition can evolve
in different ways and converge to a different asymptotic behavior. For this
reason, even the exact knowledge of the initial conditions does not necessarily
lead to the predictability of the final state of the system. Hence, the noise
can be considered as an important source of unpredictability that cannot be
fully understood using the conventional methods of nonlinear dynamics, such as
the exit basins and the uncertainty exponent. By adopting a probabilistic point
of view, we develop the concepts of probability basin, uncertainty basin and
noise-sensitivity exponent, that allow us to carry out both a quantitative and
qualitative analysis of the unpredictability on noisy chaotic scattering
problems.

unit equipped with a special check-cable in which is integrated an EM sensor
(NDI Aurora V3) that enables tracking and reconstruction capability was
assessed. Reconstructions of a 24 cm long catheter were performed using two
methods: continuous fixed speed check cable backward stepping and stepping
through each dwell position every 1mm. The ability of the system to
differentiate between two closely located (parallel) catheters was investigated
by connecting catheters to the afterloader and moving it from its axis with an
increment of 1mm. A robotic arm was used to move the catheter between each
reconstruction. Reconstructions were obtained with a locally weighted
scatter-plot smoothing algorithm. To quantify the reconstruction accuracy,
distances between two catheters were computed along the reconstruction track
with a 5mm step. Reconstructions of curve catheter paths were assessed through
parallel and perpendicular phantom configuration to the EM field generator.
Indexer length and lateral error were simulated and ROC analysis was made.
Using a 50cm/s check cable speed does not allow accurate reconstruction. A
slower check cable speed results in better reconstruction performance and
smaller standard deviations. The optimum operating distance from the field
generator (50-300mm) resulted in a lower absolute mean deviation from the
expected value (0.2pm0.1mm) versus being positioned on the edge of the
electromagnetic sensitive detection volume (0.6pm0.3mm). Reconstructions of
curved and circular paths with a check cable speed under 5cm/s gave a
0.8pm0.5mm error, or better. All indexer and lateral shifts of 1mm were
detected with a check cable speed of 2.5cm/s or under. A speed under 5cm/s is
recommended for straight and curved catheter reconstructions. The check cable
can also be used to detect common shift errors.

well-established method in neuroscience, to the few-shot learning instantiation
of MAML. Although some part of our analysis supports their general results that
feature reuse is predominant, we also reveal arguments against their
conclusion. The similarity-increase of layers closer to the input layers arises
from the learning task itself and not from the model. In addition, the
representations after inner gradient steps make a broader change to the

the condensate phase of the superconducting region connecting both JJs. In
addition we demonstrate high tunability of the total magnetic configuration of

such as $k$-center clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These
techniques crucially rely on accurate estimation of pairwise distance between
records. However, computing exact features of the records, and their pairwise
distances is often challenging, and sometimes not possible. We circumvent this
challenge by leveraging weak supervision in the form of a comparison oracle
that compares the relative distance between the queried points such as `Is
point u closer to v or w closer to x?'.
  However, it is possible that some queries are easier to answer than others
using a comparison oracle. We capture this by introducing two different noise
models called adversarial and probabilistic noise. In this paper, we study
various problems that include finding maximum, nearest/farthest neighbor search
under these noise models. Building upon the techniques we develop for these
comparison operations, we give robust algorithms for k-center clustering and
agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We prove that our algorithms achieve
good approximation guarantees with a high probability and analyze their query
complexity. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques

invariably discover the productive processes that can generalize to new words.
Morphological learning is made challenging by the fact that even fully
productive rules have exceptions, as in the well-known case of English past
tense verbs, which features the -ed rule against the irregular verbs. The
Tolerance Principle is a recent proposal that provides a precise threshold of
exceptions that a productive rule can withstand. Its empirical application so
far, however, requires the researcher to fully specify rules defined over a set
of words. We propose a greedy search model that automatically hypothesizes
rules and evaluates their productivity over a vocabulary. When the search for
broader productivity fails, the model recursively subdivides the vocabulary and
continues the search for productivity over narrower rules. Trained on
psychologically realistic data from child-directed input, our model displays
developmental patterns observed in child morphology acquisition, including the
notoriously complex case of German noun pluralization. It also produces
responses to nonce words that, despite receiving only a fraction of the

the latent features pooled at the tatum level. To capture the global repetitive

they mediate transactions across different economic sectors and operate in

Considering the gender trait as our topic of study, we report an extensive

confidence). Using three state-of-the-art datasets (PETA, PA-100K, RAP) and
five Person Attribute Recognition models, we correlate feature analysis with
gender inference accuracy using the Shapley value, enabling us to perceive the
importance of each image/subject-based feature. Furthermore, we analyze
face-based gender inference and assess the pose effect on it. Our results
suggest that: 1) image-based features are more influential for low-quality

feature importance; 3) face-based gender inference accuracy correlates with
image quality increase; and 4) subjects' frontal pose promotes an implicit

could effectively increase the cell neighbor distance and lower the potential
energy of the system. The multicellular structure transits from single- to
double-layer spontaneously with bistable states existing from 15- to 44-cell
stages, near the gastrulation timing in vivo. Specifically, the cells with a
larger size or placed near a smaller-curvature boundary are easier to
internalize. Actively regulating a few cells' internalizations can make the

sophisticated rounding techniques have been proposed, in $d$ dimensions they
require $N$ to be at least $d$, $d \log(\log(d))$, or $d^2$ based on the

where $N$ may be much less than $d$, such as in experimental design in an RKHS
where $d$ may be effectively infinite. In this work, we propose a rounding
procedure that frees $N$ of any dependence on the dimension $d$, while
achieving nearly the same performance guarantees of existing rounding
procedures. We evaluate the procedure against a baseline that projects the
problem to a lower dimensional space and performs rounding which requires $N$
to just be at least a notion of the effective dimension. We also leverage our
new approach in a new algorithm for kernelized bandits to obtain state of the

user privacy, is infeasible in the case of a single database, and requires

SPIR where the user is provided with a random subset of the shared database
common randomness, which is unknown to the databases. We determine the exact
capacity region of the triple $(d, \rho_S, \rho_U)$, where $d$ is the download

$\rho_U$ is the amount of available user-side common randomness. We show that
with a suitable amount of $\rho_U$, this new SPIR achieves the capacity of

transport enhancement, which indicates that cross-field electron transport
enhancement is based on the plasma instability. Furthermore, the comparison

that the simulated plasma instability reflects the theory of GDI. Thus, it is

estimates of the annual signal in different GNSS solutions disagree by more
than 3 mm which makes geophysical interpretation of raw GNSS time series
problematic. To overcome this problem, we have used an enhanced Common Mode
(CM) filtering technique. The time series are differentiated by the time series
from remote station BJOS with known mass loading signals removed a priori.
Using this technique, we have achieved a substantial reduction of the
differences between the GNSS solutions. We have computed mass loading time
series from a regional Climatic Mass Balance (CMB) and snow model that provides
the amount of water equivalent at a 1 km resolution with a time step of 7 days.
We found that the entire vertical loading signal is present in data of two
totally independent techniques at a statistically significant level of 95%.
This allowed us to conclude that the remaining errors in vertical signal
derived from the CMB model are less than 0.2 mm at that significance level.
Refining the land water storage loading model with a CMB model resulted in a
reduction of the annual amplitude from 2.1 mm to 1.1 mm in the CM filtered time
series, while it had only a marginal impact on raw time series. This provides a
strong evidence that CM filtering is essential for revealing local periodic

attention for potential thermoelectric applications, since their
ultrahigh-mobility carriers could generate large thermoelectric and Nernst
power factors. To optimize these efficiencies, the Fermi energy needs to be
chemically controlled in a wide range, which is generally difficult in bulk
materials because of disorder effects from the substituted ions. Here it is
shown that the Fermi energy is tunable across the Dirac point for layered
magnet EuMnBi$_2$ by partially substituting Gd$^{3+}$ for Eu$^{2+}$ in the
insulating block layer, which dopes electrons into the Dirac fermion layer
without degrading the mobility. Clear quantum oscillation observed even in the
doped samples allows us to quantitatively estimate the Fermi energy shift and
optimize the power factor (exceeding 100 $\mu$W/K$^2$cm at low temperatures) in
combination with the first-principles calculation. Furthermore, it is shown

non-relativistic phases and effects, such as the recently reported
unconventional spin physics in collinear antiferromagnets from the typically

non-relativistic collinear magnetism in three phases: conventional ferromagnets

particles. The capability to reject these backgrounds is the most important
factor determining the gamma-ray sensitivity of IACT systems. Monte Carlo
simulations are used to estimate the residual background rates and sensitivity
of the systems during the design and construction phase. Uncertainties in the
modeling of high-energy hadronic interactions of cosmic rays with nuclei in the
air propagate into the estimates of residual background rates and subsequently
into the estimated instrument sensitivity. We investigate the influence of the
difference in the current hadronic interaction models on the estimated
gamma-ray sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array using four interaction
models (QGSJET-II-03, QGSJET-II-04, EPOS-LHC, and SIBYLL2.3c) implemented in
the air shower simulation tool CORSIKA. Variations in background rates of up to
a factor 2 with respect to QGSJET-II-03 are observed between the models, mainly
due to differences in the $\pi^0$ production spectrum. These lead to ~30%

sources in the studied GGCs, cataloging tens of previously undetected variable

the vast majority of their fundamental mode RR Lyrae. We use these pulsators to
obtain distances and extinctions toward these objects. Recalibrated
period-luminosity-metallicity relations for the RR Lyrae bring the distances to
these GGCs to a closer agreement with those reported by Gaia, except for
NGC6441. Recovered proper motions for these GGCs also agree with those reported

VVV near-infrared measurements provide a more accurate determination of its
proper motions.

surface of nuclei. However, cometary outbursts may arise from other processes
that are not necessarily driven by volatiles. In order to fully understand
nuclear surfaces and their evolution, we must identify the causes of cometary
outbursts. In that context, we present a study of mini-outbursts of comet
46P/Wirtanen. Six events are found in our long-term lightcurve of the comet
around its perihelion passage in 2018. The apparent strengths range from $-0.2$
to $-1.6$ mag in a 5"" radius aperture, and correspond to dust masses between
$\sim10^4$ to $10^6$ kg, but with large uncertainties due to the unknown grain
size distributions. However, the nominal mass estimates are the same order of
magnitude as the mini-outbursts at comet 9P/Tempel 1 and
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, events which were notably lacking at comet
103P/Hartley 2. We compare the frequency of outbursts at the four comets, and
suggest that the surface of 46P has large-scale ($\sim$10-100 m) roughness that
is intermediate to that of 67P and 103P, if not similar to the latter. The
strength of the outbursts appear to be correlated with time since the last
event, but a physical interpretation with respect to solar insolation is
lacking. We also examine Hubble Space Telescope images taken about 2 days
following a near-perihelion outburst. No evidence for macroscopic ejecta was
found in the image, with a limiting radius of about 2-m.

cannot be reliably utilized due to aliasing and noise artifacts. Deep learning
(DL) reconstruction techniques have recently gained substantial interest for
improving highly-accelerated MRI. Supervised learning of DL reconstructions
generally requires fully-sampled training datasets, which is not available for
high-resolution fMRI studies. To tackle this challenge, self-supervised
learning has been proposed for training of DL reconstruction with only
undersampled datasets, showing similar performance to supervised learning. In
this study, we utilize a self-supervised physics-guided DL reconstruction on a

However, the random effect approach can pool observations only through

two-step weighting: first to adjust differences across areas and then to adjust

vis-\`{a}-vis verification of quantum devices in the scenario with fully

Development of self-testing methods is an important step forward, but these
results so far have been used for reliable verification only by considering the
asymptotic behavior of large, identically and independently distributed (IID)

procedure of its truly device-independent character. In this paper, we develop
a systematic approach to device-independent verification of quantum states free

data, given on a time-space cylinder that is a strict subset of the
computational domain under consideration. Unlike previous approaches to this
and related problems our starting point is a regularized least squares
formulation in a continuous infinite-dimensional setting that is based on
stable variational time-space formulations of the parabolic PDE. This allows us
to derive a priori as well as a posteriori error bounds for the recovered
states with respect to a certain reference solution. In these bounds the
regularization parameter is disentangled from the underlying discretization. An
important ingredient for the derivation of a posteriori bounds is the
construction of suitable Fortin operators which allow us to control oscillation
errors stemming from the discretization of dual norms. Moreover, the
variational framework allows us to contrive preconditioners for the discrete
problems whose application can be performed in linear time, and for which the
condition numbers of the preconditioned systems are uniformly proportional to
that of the regularized continuous problem.
  In particular, we provide suitable stopping criteria for the iterative
solvers based on the a posteriori error bounds. The presented numerical
experiments quantify the theoretical findings and demonstrate the performance
of the numerical scheme in relation with the underlying discretization and
regularization.

different crops for forward and backward frames, and adopt feature warping to
establish correspondence between two crops of a same frame. The former

different absolute positions, and the latter effectively blocks the shortcuts
going between forward and back tracks. In three label propagation benchmarks

management of the cities. More specifically, the connection between the
efficiency and uncertainty (entropy) production of a transport process is not
established yet. In this study, we consider the movements of selfish drivers
from their homes (origins) to work places (destinations) to see how
interactions and randomness in the movements affect a measure of efficiency and
entropy production (uncertainty in the destination time intervals) in this
process. We employ realistic models of population distributions and mobility
laws to simulate the movement process, where interactions are modelled by
dependence of the local travel times on the local flows. We observe that some
level of information (the travel times) sharing enhances a measure of
predictability in the process without any coordination. Moreover, the larger
cities display smaller efficiencies, for the same model parameters and
population density, which limits the size of an efficient city. We find that
entropy production is a good order parameter to distinguish the low- and
high-congestion phases. In the former phase, the entropy production grows
monotonically with the probability of random moves, whereas it displays a
minimum in the congested phase; that is randomness in the movements can reduce
the uncertainty in the destination time intervals. The findings highlight the
role of entropy production in the study of efficiency and predictability of
similar processes in a complex system like the city.

source. Despite the obscuration, we measure UV and optical continuum
reverberation lags consistent with a centrally illuminated Shakura-Sunyaev thin
accretion disk, and measure reverberation lags associated with the optical

UV continuum and the UV broad emission line variability. The correlation
recovers in the next 42 days of the campaign, as Mrk 817 enters a less obscured

leverage the stellar population synthesis model FSPS, together with SFHs
predicted by the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG and the empirical model
UNIVERSEMACHINE, to study the impact of star formation variability on galaxy
colours. We start by introducing a model-independent metric to quantify the
burstiness of a galaxy formation model, and we use this metric to demonstrate
that UNIVERSEMACHINE predicts SFHs with more burstiness relative to
IllustrisTNG. Using this metric and principal component analysis, we construct
families of SFH models with adjustable variability, and we show that the
precision of broad-band optical and near-infrared colours degrades as the level
of unresolved short-term variability increases. We use the same technique to
demonstrate that variability in metallicity and dust attenuation presents a
practically negligible impact on colours relative to star formation
variability. We additionally provide a model-independent fitting function
capturing how the level of unresolved star formation variability translates
into imprecision in predictions for galaxy colours; our fitting function can be
used to determine the minimal SFH model that reproduces colours with some
target precision. Finally, we show that modelling the colours of individual
galaxies with percent-level precision demands resorting to complex SFH models,
while producing precise colours for galaxy populations can be achieved using
models with just a few degrees of freedom.

dark matter haloes only depends on halo mass. However, it has been long
established that the clustering of haloes also depends on other properties,
including formation time, concentration, and spin; this effect is commonly
known as halo assembly bias. We use a suite of gravity-only simulations to
study the dependence of halo assembly bias on cosmology; these simulations
cover cosmological parameters spanning 10$\sigma$ around state-of-the-art
best-fitting values, including standard extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm
such as neutrino mass and dynamical dark energy. We find that the strength of
halo assembly bias presents variations smaller than 0.05 dex across all
cosmologies studied for concentration and spin selected haloes, letting us
conclude that the dependence of halo assembly bias upon cosmology is
negligible. We then study the dependence of galaxy assembly bias (i.e. the
manifestation of halo assembly bias in galaxy clustering) on cosmology using
subhalo abundance matching. We find that galaxy assembly bias also presents
very small dependence upon cosmology ($\sim$ 2$\%$-4$\%$ of the total
clustering); on the other hand, we find that the dependence of this signal on
the galaxy formation parameters of our galaxy model is much stronger. Taken
together, these results let us conclude that the dependence of halo and galaxy

estimate mass-loss rates for a broad range of planets that host
hydrogen-dominated atmospheres as well as for performing atmospheric evolution
calculations. Aims: We aim to study the applicability range of the EL
approximation. Methods: We revise the EL formalism and its assumptions. We also
compare its results with those of hydrodynamic simulations, employing a grid
covering planets with masses, radii, and equilibrium temperatures ranging
between 1 $M_{\oplus}$ and 39 $M_{\oplus}$, 1 $R_{\oplus}$ and 10 $R_{\oplus}$,

that the EL approximation gives a correct order of magnitude estimate for
mass-loss rates for about 76% of the planets, but there can be departures from
hydrodynamic simulations by up to three orders of magnitude in individual
cases. Furthermore, we find that planets for which the mass-loss rates are
correctly estimated by the EL approximation to within one order of magnitude
have intermediate gravitational potentials as well as low-to-intermediate
equilibrium temperatures and irradiation fluxes of extreme ultraviolet and
X-ray radiation. However, for planets with low or high gravitational
potentials, or high equilibrium temperatures and irradiation fluxes, the
approximation fails in most cases. Conclusions: The EL approximation should not
be used for planetary evolution calculations that require computing mass-loss
rates for planets that cover a broad parameter space. In this case, it is very
likely that the EL approximation would at times return mass-loss rates of up to
several orders of magnitude above or below those predicted by hydrodynamic
simulations. For planetary atmospheric evolution calculations, interpolation
routines or approximations based on grids of hydrodynamic models should be used
instead.

across time, but also faithfully captures the diversity with which halos
assemble their mass. Our python implementation is based on the autodiff library
JAX, and so our model self-consistently captures the mean and variance of halo
mass accretion rate across cosmic time. We show that the connection between
halo assembly and the large-scale density field, known as halo assembly bias,

asymmetrically-emitting source should cause a permanent change in the local
space-time metric. This phenomenon, called the \emph{gravitational memory
effect}, has never been observed, however supernova neutrinos have long been
considered a promising avenue for its detection in the future. With the advent
of deci-Hertz gravitational wave interferometers, observing the supernova
neutrino memory will be possible, with important implications for
multimessenger astronomy and for tests of gravity. In this work, we develop a
phenomenological (analytical) toy model for the supernova neutrino memory
effect, which is overall consistent with the results of numerical simulations.
This description is then generalized to several case studies of interest. We
find that, for a galactic supernova, the dimensionless strain, $h(t)$, is of
order $\sim 10^{-22} - 10^{-21}$, and develops over a typical time scale that
varies between $\sim 0.1 - 10$ s, depending on the time-evolution of the
anisotropy of the neutrino emission. The characteristic strain, $h_c(f)$, has a
maximum at a frequency $f_{max} \sim {\mathcal O}(10^{-1}) - {\mathcal O}(1)$
Hz. The detailed features of the time- and frequency-structure of the memory
strain will inform us of the matter dynamics near the collapsed core, and allow
to distinguish between different stellar collapse scenarios. Next generation
gravitational wave detectors like DECIGO and BBO will be sensitive to the
neutrino memory effect for supernovae at typical galactic distances and beyond;

produce a less magnified leading peak. We find that, for a point-mass lens

challenges have become the standard for validation of biomedical image analysis

algorithms on ""real-world"" clinical data often remains unclear, as the data
included in challenges are usually acquired in very controlled settings at few
institutions. The seemingly obvious solution of just collecting increasingly
more data from more institutions in such challenges does not scale well due to
privacy and ownership hurdles. Towards alleviating these concerns, we are
proposing the FeTS challenge 2021 to cater towards both the development and the
evaluation of models for the segmentation of intrinsically heterogeneous (in
appearance, shape, and histology) brain tumors, namely gliomas. Specifically,
the FeTS 2021 challenge uses clinically acquired, multi-institutional magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the BraTS 2020 challenge, as well as from
various remote independent institutions included in the collaborative network
of a real-world federation (https://www.fets.ai/). The goals of the FeTS
challenge are directly represented by the two included tasks: 1) the
identification of the optimal weight aggregation approach towards the training
of a consensus model that has gained knowledge via federated learning from
multiple geographically distinct institutions, while their data are always
retained within each institution, and 2) the federated evaluation of the
generalizability of brain tumor segmentation models ""in the wild"", i.e. on data

observations of eleven dwarf galaxies that were chosen as AGN candidates using
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mid-infrared (mid-IR) color-color

galaxies. Based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy, six galaxies in our
sample have optical evidence for hosting AGNs and five are classified as

expected from X-ray binaries in the nuclei of five of the six galaxies with
optical evidence of AGNs. However, the X-ray emission from these AGNs is
generally much lower than expected based on AGN scaling relations with infrared

optically-selected star-forming galaxies despite having red mid-IR colors. Only
two are detected in X-rays and their properties are consistent with

that two-color mid-IR AGN diagnostics at the resolution of WISE cannot be used

recent years, ranging from drug discovery, recommendation systems, image
classification, social network analysis to natural language understanding. This
paper shows their efficacy in modeling relationships between products and
making predictions for unseen product networks. By representing products as
nodes and their relationships as edges of a graph, we show how an inductive
graph neural network approach, named GraphSAGE, can efficiently learn
continuous representations for nodes and edges. These representations also
capture product feature information such as price, brand, or engineering
attributes. They are combined with a classification model for predicting the
existence of the relationship between products. Using a case study of the
Chinese car market, we find that our method yields double the prediction
performance compared to an Exponential Random Graph Model-based method for
predicting the co-consideration relationship between cars. While a vanilla
GraphSAGE requires a partial network to make predictions, we introduce an
`adjacency prediction model' to circumvent this limitation. This enables us to
predict product relationships when no neighborhood information is known.
Finally, we demonstrate how a permutation-based interpretability analysis can
provide insights on how design attributes impact the predictions of
relationships between products. This work provides a systematic method to
predict the relationships between products in many different markets.

two different clustering approaches enabling clients aggregation based on 1)

enabling the propagation of a broadband continuum of coherent THz spin waves.

behavioral experiments (n=488), where text and emoji content of social media
posts were carefully controlled before being presented to participants, we find
in the affirmative -- emoji are a salient signal of author identity. That
signal is distinct from, and complementary to, the one encoded in language.
Participant groups (based on self-identified ethnicity) showed no differences
in how they perceive this signal, except in the case of the default yellow
emoji. While both groups associate this with a White identity, the effect was
stronger in White participants. Our finding that emoji can index social
variables will have experimental applications for researchers but also
implications for designers: supposedly ``neutral`` defaults may be more
representative of some users than others.

for corner-point grid (CPG) geometry is developed for simulation of flow and
heat transfer in fractured porous media. Unlike classical embedded discrete
fracture approaches, this method allows for using any geologically-relevant
model with a complex geometry and generic conductivity contrasts between the
rock matrix and the fractures (or faults). The mass and energy conservation
equations are coupled using the fully-implicit (FIM) scheme, allowing for
stable simulation. Independent corner-point grids are imposed on the rock
matrix and all fractures. The connectivities between the non-neighboring grid
cells are described such that a consistent discrete representation of the
embedded fractures occurs within the corner-point grid geometry. Various
numerical tests including geologically-relevant and real-field models are
conducted to demonstrate the performance of the developed method. It is shown
that pEDFM can accurately capture the physical influence of both highly
conductive fractures and flow barriers on the flow and heat transfer fields in
complex reservoir geometries. This development casts a promising approach for
flow simulations of real-field geo-models, increasing the discretization
flexibility and enhancing the computational performance for capturing explicit
fractures accurately.

brain tissue or elsewhere inside the skull. It can be caused by physical trauma
or by various medical conditions and in many cases leads to death. The
treatment must be started as soon as possible, and therefore the hemorrhage
should be diagnosed accurately and quickly. The diagnosis is usually performed
by a radiologist who analyses a Computed Tomography (CT) scan containing a
large number of cross-sectional images throughout the brain. Analysing each
image manually can be very time-consuming, but automated techniques can help
speed up the process. While much of the recent research has focused on solving
this problem by using supervised machine learning algorithms,
publicly-available training data remains scarce due to privacy concerns. This
problem can be alleviated by unsupervised algorithms. In this paper, we propose
a fully-unsupervised algorithm which is based on the mixture models. Our
algorithm utilizes the fact that the properties of hemorrhage and healthy
tissues follow different distributions, and therefore an appropriate
formulation of these distributions allows us to separate them through an
Expectation-Maximization process. In addition, our algorithm is able to
adaptively determine the number of clusters such that all the hemorrhage
regions can be found without including noisy voxels. We demonstrate the results
of our algorithm on publicly-available datasets that contain all different
hemorrhage types in various sizes and intensities, and our results are compared
to earlier unsupervised and supervised algorithms. The results show that our
algorithm can outperform the other algorithms with most hemorrhage types.

of fundamental physics, especially in our pursuit of quantum gravity. In
particular, the holographic entanglement entropy is a very useful tool in
studying AdS/CFT, and its efficacy is manifested in the recent black hole page
curve calculation. On the other hand, the one-shot information-theoretic
entropies, such as the smooth min/max-entropies, are less discussed in AdS/CFT.
They are however more fundamental entropy measures from the quantum information
perspective and should also play pivotal roles in holography. We combine the
technical methods from both quantum information and quantum gravity to put this
idea on firm grounds. In particular, we study the quantum extremal surface
(QES) prescription that was recently revised to highlight the significance of
one-shot entropies in characterizing the QES phase transition. Motivated by the
asymptotic equipartition property (AEP), we derive the refined quantum extremal
surface prescription for fixed-area states via a novel AEP replica trick,
demonstrating the synergy between quantum information and quantum gravity. We
further prove that, when restricted to pure bulk marginal states, such
corrections do not occur for the higher R\'enyi entropies of a boundary
subregion in fixed-area states, meaning they always have sharp QES transitions.
Our path integral derivation suggests that the refinement applies beyond
AdS/CFT, and we confirm it in a black hole toy model by showing that the Page
curve, for a black hole in a superposition of two radiation stages, receives a
large correction that is consistent with the refined QES prescription.

readings from a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device is a problem of
great importance in diabetes care, and therefore, has attracted a lot of
research in recent years, especially based on machine learning. An accurate
prediction with a 30, 60, or 90 minute prediction horizon has the potential of
saving millions of dollars in emergency care costs. In this paper, we treat the
problem as one of function approximation, where the value of the BG level at
time $t+h$ (where $h$ the prediction horizon) is considered to be an unknown
function of $d$ readings prior to the time $t$. This unknown function may be
supported in particular on some unknown submanifold of the $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space. While manifold learning is classically done in a
semi-supervised setting, where the entire data has to be known in advance, we
use recent ideas to achieve an accurate function approximation in a supervised
setting; i.e., construct a model for the target function. We use the
state-of-the-art clinically relevant PRED-EGA grid to evaluate our results, and
demonstrate that for a real life dataset, our method performs better than a
standard deep network, especially in hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic regimes.
One noteworthy aspect of this work is that the training data and test data may
come from different distributions.

parameterized fixed-point problems that arise in the context of obstacle-type

then the maximal and minimal element of the solution set of the problem depend
locally Lipschitz continuously on the involved parameters. We further show
that, if certain concavity conditions hold, then the maximal solution mapping
is Hadamard directionally differentiable and its directional derivatives are
precisely the minimal solutions of suitably defined linearized fixed-point
equations. In contrast to prior results, our analysis requires neither a
Dirichlet space structure, nor restrictive assumptions on the mapping behavior
and regularity of the involved operators, nor sign conditions on the directions
that are considered in the directional derivatives. Our approach further covers
the elliptic and parabolic setting simultaneously and also yields Hadamard
directional differentiability results in situations in which the solution set
of the fixed-point equation is a continuum and a characterization of
directional derivatives via linearized auxiliary problems is provably
impossible. To illustrate that our results can be used to study interesting
problems arising in practice, we apply them to establish the Hadamard
directional differentiability of the solution operator of a nonlinear elliptic
quasi-variational inequality, which emerges in impulse control and in which the
obstacle mapping is obtained by taking essential infima over certain parts of
the underlying domain, and of the solution mapping of a parabolic

value of collecting additional information through a study with a given design.
Standard EVSI analyses assume that the treatment recommendations based on the
new information will be implemented immediately and completely once the study
has finished. However, treatment implementation is often slow and incomplete,
giving a biased estimation of the study value. Previous methods have adjusted
for this bias, but they typically make the unrealistic assumption that the
study outcomes do not impact the implementation. One method does assume that
the implementation is related to the strength of evidence in favour of the
treatment but this method uses analytical results, which require alternative
restrictive assumptions. Methods: We develop two implementation-adjusted EVSI
calculation methods that relax these assumptions. The first method uses
computationally demanding nested simulations, using the definition of the
implementation-adjusted EVSI. The second method aims to facilitate the
computation by adapting a recently developed efficient EVSI computation method
to adjust for imperfect implementation. The implementation-adjusted EVSI is
then calculated with the two methods across three examples. Results: The
maximum difference between the two methods is at most 6% in all examples. The
efficient computation method is between 6 and 60 times faster than the nested
simulation method in this case study and could be used in practice.
Conclusions: The methods developed in this paper calculate
implementation-adjusted EVSI using realistic assumptions. The efficient
estimation method is accurate and can estimate the implementation-adjusted EVSI
in practice. By adapting standard EVSI estimation methods, we allow accurate
adjustments for imperfect implementation with the same computational cost as a
standard analysis.

learn a linear representation of nonlinear system dynamics using the Koopman
operator. The presented system modeling approach leverages a novel incremental
Koopman-based update law that retrieves a mini-batch of samples stored in a
memory to not only minimizes the instantaneous Koopman operator's
identification errors but also the identification errors for the batch of
retrieved samples. Discontinuous modifications of gradient flows are presented
for the online update law to assure finite-time convergence under
easy-to-verify conditions defined on the batch of data. Therefore, this unified
online-batch framework allows performing joint sample- and time-domain analysis
for converging the Koopman operator's parameters. More specifically, it is
shown that if the collected mini-batch of samples guarantees a rank condition,
then finite-time guarantee in the time domain can be certified and the settling
time depends on the quality of collected samples being reused in the update
law. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed Koopman-based update law is
further analyzed by showing that the identification regret in continuous time
grows sub-linearly with time. Furthermore, to avoid learning corrupted dynamics
due to the selection of an inappropriate set of Koopman observables, a
higher-layer meta learner employs a discrete Bayesian optimization algorithm to
obtain the best library of observable functions for the operator. Since
finite-time convergence of the Koopman model for each set of observable is
guaranteed under a rank condition on stored data, the fitness of each set of
observables can be obtained based on the identification error on the stored
samples in the proposed framework and even without implementing any controller
based on the learned system.

driven by the host star can successfully reproduce the observed pile-up of warm
Jupiters near 1-2 au. However, since a range of different mechanisms have been
proposed to cause the same feature, clear observational diagnostics of disc
dispersal leaving an imprint in the observed distribution of giant planets
could help to constrain the dominant mechanisms. We aim to assess the impact of
disc dispersal via X-ray driven-photoevaporation (XPE) onto giant planet
separations in order to provide theoretical constraints on the location and
size of any possible features related to this process within their observed
orbital distribution. For this purpose, we perform a set of 1D population
syntheses with varying initial conditions and correlate the gas giants' final
parking locations with the X-ray luminosities of their host stars in order to
quantify observables of this process within the $L_\mathrm{x}$-$a$-plane of
these systems. We find that XPE indeed creates an underdensity of gas giants
near the gravitational radius, with corresponding pile-ups inside and/or
outside of this location. However, the size and location of these features are
strongly dependent on the choice of initial conditions in our model, such as
the assumed formation location of the planets. XPE can strongly affect the
migration process of giant planets and leave potentially observable signatures
within the observed orbital separations of giant planets. However, due to the
simplistic approach employed in our model, which lacks a self-consistent
treatment of planet formation within an evolving disc, a quantitative analysis
of the final planet population orbits is not possible. Our results however
strongly motivate future studies to include realistic disc dispersal mechanisms
into global planet population synthesis models.

scale. Although a few of these structural parameters, primarily linked to the
nanoparticle and the mirror morphology, have been identified, the impact of
molecular assembly and organization of the spacer layer between them has often
been left uncharacterized. Here, we experimentally investigate how the complex
and reconfigurable nature of a thiol-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM)
adsorbed on the mirror surface impacts the optical properties of the NPoMs. We
fabricate NPoMs with distinct molecular organizations by controlling the
incubation time of the mirror in the thiol solution. Afterwards, we investigate
the structural changes that occur under laser irradiation by tracking the
bonding dipole plasmon mode, while also monitoring Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman
scattering from the molecules as a probe of their integrity. First, we find an
effective decrease in the SAM height as the laser power increases, compatible
with an irreversible change of molecule orientation caused by heating. Second,
we observe that the nanocavities prepared with a densely packed and more
ordered monolayer of molecules are more prone to changes in their resonance
compared to samples with sparser and more disordered SAMs. Our measurements
indicate that molecular orientation and packing on the mirror surface play a
key role in determining the stability of NPoM structures and hence highlight
the under-recognized significance of SAM characterization in the development of

density around Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-selected clusters using both weak lensing and
galaxy counts. The clusters are selected from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
Data Release 5 and the galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 dataset.
With signal-to-noise of 62 (43) for galaxy (weak lensing) profiles over scales
of about $0.2-20h^{-1}$ Mpc, these are the highest precision measurements for
SZ-selected clusters to date. Because SZ selection closely approximates mass
selection, these measurements enable several tests of theoretical models of the
mass and light distribution around clusters. Our main findings are: 1. The
splashback feature is detected at a consistent location in both the mass and
galaxy profiles and its location is consistent with predictions of cold dark
matter N-body simulations. 2. The full mass profile is also consistent with the
simulations; hence it can constrain alternative dark matter models that modify
the mass distribution of clusters. 3. The shapes of the galaxy and lensing
profiles are remarkably similar for our sample over the entire range of scales,
from well inside the cluster halo to the quasilinear regime. This can be used
to constrain processes such as quenching and tidal disruption that alter the
galaxy distribution inside the halo, and scale-dependent features in the
transition regime outside the halo. We measure the dependence of the profile
shapes on the galaxy sample, redshift and cluster mass. We extend the Diemer \&
Kravtsov model for the cluster profiles to the linear regime using perturbation
theory and show that it provides a good match to the measured profiles. We also
compare the measured profiles to predictions of the standard halo model and
simulations that include hydrodynamics. Applications of these results to
cluster mass estimation and cosmology are discussed.

isometry [42]. Specifically, we examine neural network pruning from an unusual
perspective: pruning as initialization for finetuning, and ask whether the
inherited weights serve as a good initialization for the finetuning? The
insights from dynamical isometry suggest a negative answer. Despite its
critical role, this issue has not been well-recognized by the community so far.
In this paper, we will show the understanding of this problem is very important

to the GNN method is its ability to consider not only the local structure

design a significantly more efficient model that provides essentially the same

with an image, including identifying unseen labels, is challenging, especially
for images that portray numerous semantically diverse labels. As challenging as
this task is, it is an essential task to tackle since it represents many
real-world cases, such as image retrieval of natural images. We argue that
using a single embedding vector to represent an image, as commonly practiced,
is not sufficient to rank both relevant seen and unseen labels accurately. This
study introduces an end-to-end model training for multi-label zero-shot
learning that supports semantic diversity of the images and labels. We propose
to use an embedding matrix having principal embedding vectors trained using a
tailored loss function. In addition, during training, we suggest up-weighting
in the loss function image samples presenting higher semantic diversity to
encourage the diversity of the embedding matrix. Extensive experiments show
that our proposed method improves the zero-shot model's quality in tag-based
image retrieval achieving SoTA results on several common datasets (NUS-Wide,

live-stream video content for viewers who can optionally express their
appreciation through monetary donations. DLive is one of the smaller and
lesser-known streaming platforms, and historically has had fewer content
moderation practices. It has thus become a popular place for violent extremists
and other clandestine groups to earn money and propagandize. What is the
financial structure of the DLive streaming ecosystem and how much money is
changing hands? In the past it has been difficult to understand how far-right
extremists fundraise via podcasts and video streams because of the secretive
nature of the activity and because of the difficulty of getting data from
social media platforms. This paper describes a novel experiment to collect and
analyze data from DLive's publicly available ledgers of transactions in order
to understand the financial structure of the clandestine, extreme far-right
video streaming community. The main findings of this paper are, first, that the
majority of donors are using micropayments in varying frequencies, but a small
handful of donors spend large amounts of money to finance their favorite
streamers. Next, the timing of donations to high-profile far-right streamers
follows a fairly predictable pattern that is closely tied to a broadcast
schedule. Finally, the far-right video streaming financial landscape is divided
into separate cliques which exhibit very little crossover in terms of sizable
donations. This work will be important to technology companies, policymakers,
and researchers who are trying to understand how niche social media services,
including video platforms, are being exploited by extremists to propagandize
and fundraise.

TN is greater than TN ~ 47 K for the MnP single crystal, indicating strong
strain-modulated helimagnetic states in the MnP nanorod film. The presence of
significant thermal hysteresis in the helical phase indicates coexistence of
competing magnetic interactions, leading to the first-order metamagnetic
transition. Similar to its single crystal counterpart, an anisotropic magnetic
effect is observed in the MnP film, which is independently confirmed by
magnetic hysteresis loop and radio-frequency transverse susceptibility (TS)
measurements. The evolution of screw (SCR) to CONE and FAN phase is precisely
tracked from magnetization versus magnetic field/temperature measurements. The
temperature dependence of the anisotropy fields, extracted from the TS spectra,
yields further insight into the competing nature of the magnetic phases.
Unfolding of the different helical phases at T < 120 K (~TN) is analyzed by the
temperature- and field-dependent magnetic entropy change. Based on these
findings, the comprehensive magnetic phase diagrams of the MnP nanorod film are
constructed for the first time for both the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic
field directions, revealing emergent strain/dimensionality-driven helical
magnetic features that are absent in the magnetic phase diagram of the MnP

dynamics, thermodynamic, and kinetic approaches. It is shown that BN compounds
are formed in the interaction of N2 molecules with small boron clusters (N2
molecule fixation) rather than with less reactive liquid boron. We demonstrate
that the transformation and consumption of liquid boron proceeds through the
evaporation of clusters, Bm with m less than or equal to 5 and their subsequent
conversion into BmNn chains. The production of such chains is crucial to the
growth of BNNTs because these chains form the building blocks of bigger and
longer BN chains and rings, which are themselves the building blocks of
fullborenes and BNNTs. Moreover, kinetic modelling revealed that B4N4 and B5N4
species play a major role in the N2 molecule fixation process. The formation of
these species via reactions with B4 and B5 clusters is not adequately described
under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium because the accumulation of
both B4N4 and B5N4 depends on the background gas pressure and the gas cooling
rate. Long BN chains and rings, which are precursors of the fullborene and BNNT
growth, form via self-assembly of component B4N4 and B5N4. Our modelling
results (particularly the increased densities of B4N4 and B5N4 species at
higher gas pressures) explain the experimentally observed effect of gas
pressure on the yield of high-quality BNNTs. The catalytic role of hydrogen was
also studied; it is shown that HBNH molecules can be the main precursor of BNNT

713 spectroscopically-classified M0-M8 dwarfs with new rotation rates measured
from K2 light curves. We analyzed data and recover rotation rates for 179 of
these objects. We add these to rotation rates for members of clusters with
known ages (5-700 Myr), as well as objects assumed to have field ages ($>$1
Gyr). We use Gaia DR2 parallax and (G-GRP) photometry to create color-magnitude
diagrams to compare objects across samples. We use color-period plots to
analyze the period distributions across age, as well as incorporate Halpha
equivalent width and tangential velocity where possible to further comment on
age dependence. We find that the age of transition from rapid to slow rotation
in clusters, which we define as an elbow in the period-color plots, depends on
spectral type. Later spectral types transition at older ages: M4 for Praesepe
at 700 Myr, one of the oldest clusters for which M dwarf rotation rates have
been measured. The transition from active to inactive Halpha equivalent width
also occurs at this elbow, as objects transition from rapid rotation to the
slowly rotating sequence. Redder or smaller stars remain active at older ages.
Finally, using Gaia kinematics we find evidence for rotation stalling for late
Ms in the field sample, suggesting the transition happens much later for mid to
late-type M dwarfs.

While the growth of MWBDs increases the flexibility of medical services, the

waves (CDW) have been one of the most commonly encountered electronic phases in

combines Fermi surface nesting and electron-phonon coupling but is, strictly
speaking, only valid in one dimension. In higher dimensions, its relevance is
questionable as sharp maxima in the static electronic susceptibility \chi(q)
are smeared out, and are, in many cases, unable to account for the periodicity
of the observed charge modulations. Here, we investigate the quasi
twodimensional LaAgSb2, which exhibits two CDW transitions, by a combination of
diffuse xray scattering, inelastic x-ray scattering and ab initio calculations.
We demonstrate that the CDW formation is driven by phonons softening. The
corresponding Kohn anomalies are visualized in 3D through the momentum
distribution of the x-ray diffuse scattering intensity. We show that they can
be quantitatively accounted for by considering the electronic susceptibility
calculated from a Dirac-like band, weighted by anisotropic electron-phonon
coupling. This remarkable agreement sheds new light on the importance of Fermi
surface nesting in CDW formation.

concentrations ($\phi$) of $1$ to $20$ wt% of lysozyme in an aqueous solution
on its drying and final dried film state using bright-field optical microscopy.
The $\phi$ is divided into three regimes, ultra-concentrated ($20$ $<$ $\phi$
$\leq$ $17$ wt%), concentrated ($17$ $<$ $\phi$ $\leq$ $9$ wt%) and diluted
($9$ $<$ $\phi$ $\leq$ $1$ wt%). Increasing $\phi$ in these regimes finds that
this movement in the later non-linear region slows down as the front carries
and deposits protein molecules until the supply in solution is exhausted. In
the ultra-concentrated regime, the fluid front moves linearly throughout the
drying process. The deposition of protein onto the surface by the fluid front
creates the ""coffee-ring"" and increases with increasing $\phi$. A dimple is
observed in a central mound-structure, which grows with increasing $\phi$. As
the temperature increases the drying rate increases, reducing the time for
convective flow and the deposition of material at the fluid front.
Interestingly, at (T, $\phi$) = ($55 ^{\circ}$C, $20$ wt%), the droplet forms
the thickest film with suppressed ring formation. The dimple diminishes in the
ultra-concentrated regime, whereas it changes to an expanded spot in some
samples of the diluted and concentrated regimes with elevated temperatures.
Both initial concentration and substrate temperature lead to surface tension
and temperature gradients across the droplet, affecting the morphological
patterns. This study provides insights into protein-protein and
protein-substrate interactions driven by temperature and concentration for
biomedical and biosensing applications.

learning long-timescale information has been a challenge for recurrent neural
networks. Despite improvements in long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), the
forgetting mechanism results in the exponential decay of information, limiting
their capacity to capture long-timescale information. Here, we propose a power
law forget gate, which instead learns to forget information along a slower
power law decay function. Specifically, the new gate learns to control the
power law decay factor, p, allowing the network to adjust the information decay
rate according to task demands. Our experiments show that an LSTM with power
law forget gates (pLSTM) can effectively capture long-range dependencies beyond
hundreds of elements on image classification, language modeling, and
categorization tasks, improving performance over the vanilla LSTM. We also
inspected the revised forget gate by varying the initialization of p, setting p
to a fixed value, and ablating cells in the pLSTM network. The results show
that the information decay can be controlled by the learnable decay factor p,
which allows pLSTM to achieve its superior performance. Altogether, we found
that LSTM with the proposed forget gate can learn long-term dependencies,
outperforming other recurrent networks in multiple domains; such gating
mechanism can be integrated into other architectures for improving the learning
of long timescale information in recurrent neural networks.

  Buffer Saline Solution",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The process of drying is a simple physical mechanism that drives a system to
relax from one equilibrium point to another. The native states of the
constituent particles in the droplets can be linked to the emergent
morphological patterns via this drying process. This paper explores the
interplay between different initial concentrations of a globular protein
lysozyme ($\phi_p$) and the salts ($\phi_s$) in the phosphate buffer saline
(PBS). The $\phi_s$ = 0 wt% embodies the lysozyme solution prepared in
de-ionized water. The samples at $\phi_s$ = 0.9 wt% display a dark texture in
the central region. We examined the drying evolution and dried morphology by
extracting the mean gray values (I) and standard deviation (SD). For this,
$\phi_p$ was fixed at 9.0 wt%, and only the $\phi_s$ were varied. The I
decreases, and the SD increases as the salt crystals start appearing during the
drying process. The phase separation of these salts directly maps with this
textural evolution and is influenced by the salts' amount in these droplets.
The scanning electron microscopic images of the dried films at $\phi_s$ = 0.5
wt% at different $\phi_p$ show that the lysozyme-salt interactions drop off in
the ring region. This ring becomes more apparent with the increasing $\phi_p$.
Though all the droplets show ""coffee-ring"" behavior, the leftover lysozyme
particles indicated with the mound-like structure diminishes in the salts'
presence. The alteration of the crack patterns is also found. Therefore, the
chemistry between multiple salts and lysozyme at various initial concentrations
reveals that the features are not merely a sum (or average) of individual
microscopic actions. It appears to involve both protein-protein and
protein-salt interactions partially averaged over one length/time scale that
sets the next larger/longer length/time scale in such drying droplets.

demonstrate the effectiveness of the surrogate-accelerated modeling and

accurately capture the dynamics of a HVAC cycle at less than 4\% error while
accelerating its simulation by 340x. We illustrate the use of surrogate

main interests of sentiment analysis and opinion mining studies. Existing
approaches in the sentiment analysis domain mostly do not discriminate the
sentences of different types of users, even though some users are always
negative and some are always positive. Thus, finding a way to identify these
two types of user is significant because their attitudes can change the
analysis of user reviews of businesses and products. Due to the complexity of
natural language processing, pure text mining methods may lead to
misunderstandings about the exact nature of the sentiments expressed in review
text. In this study, we propose a neural network classifier to predict the
presence of biased users on the basis of users' psychological behaviors. The
identification of the psychological behaviors of users allows us to find overly
positive and overly negative users and to categorize these users' attitudes
regardless of the content of their review texts. The experiment result
indicates that the biased users can be predicted based on user behavior at an
accuracy rate of 89%, 67% and 81% for three different datasets.

propose a method that maintains the flexibility and scalability of selective

hybrid segments. Instead, it takes advantage of directional growth methods and
uses bottom-up grown InP structures as shadowing objects to obtain selective

of these objects, and to grow a predefined height, ensures precise control of
the shadowed region. We demonstrate the approach by growing InSb nanowire
networks with well-defined Al and Pb islands. Cross-section cuts of the
nanowires reveal a sharp, oxide-free interface between semiconductor and
superconductor. By growing InP structures on both sides of in-plane nanowires,
a combination of Pt and Pb can independently be shadow deposited, enabling a
scalable and reproducible in-situ device fabrication. The
semiconductor-superconductor nanostructures resulting from this approach are at

not have closed-form update rules, which makes EM algorithm impractical. In
this work, we study the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of MLR

consider the case that noise has Laplacian distribution and we first show that

future computers will be incredibly powerful, if they are based on von Neumann

power consumption than conventional processors. Among their potential future

edge devices.

substitutes to improve their catalog quality and guide customers through myriad
choices. Entity resolution using pairwise product matching models offers a
means of inferring relationships between products. In mature data repositories,
the relationships may be mostly correct but require incremental improvements
owing to errors in the original data or in the entity resolution system. It is
critical to devise incremental entity resolution (IER) approaches for improving
the health of relationships. However, most existing research on IER focuses on
the addition of new products or information into existing relationships.
Relatively little research has been done for detecting low quality within
current relationships.
  This paper proposes a novel method for identifying inconsistent clusters
(IC), existing groups of related products that do not belong together. We
propose to treat the identification of inconsistent clusters as a supervised
learning task which predicts whether a graph of products with similarities as
weighted edges should be partitioned into multiple clusters. In this case, the
problem becomes a classification task on weighted graphs and represents an
interesting application area for modern tools such as Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs). We demonstrate that existing Message Passing neural networks perform
well at this task, exceeding traditional graph processing techniques. We also
develop a novel message aggregation scheme for Message Passing Neural Networks
that further improves the performance of GNNs on this task. We apply the model
to synthetic datasets, a public benchmark dataset, and an internal application.
Our results demonstrate the value of graph classification in IER and the
ability of graph neural networks to develop useful representations for graph
partitioning.

execution are guaranteed. Intel's Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) is an example
of such primitives and its isolated processes are called \emph{enclaves}. These
guarantees, however, can be easily thwarted if the enclave has not been
properly designed. Its interface with the untrusted software stack is arguably
the largest attack surface that adversaries can exploit; unintended
interactions with untrusted code can expose the enclave to memory corruption
attacks, for instance. In this paper, we propose a notion of an \emph{orderly}
enclave which splits its behaviour into several execution phases each of which
imposes a set of restrictions on accesses to untrusted memory, phase
transitions and registers sanitisation. A violation to these restrictions
indicates an undesired behaviour which could be harnessed to perpetrate attacks
against the enclave. We also introduce \Analyser{}: a tool that uses symbolic
execution to carry out the validation of an enclave against our notion of an
orderly enclave; in this process, it also looks for some typical
memory-corruption vulnerabilities. We discuss how our approach can prevent and
flag enclave vulnerabilities that have been identified in the literature.
Moreover, we have evaluated how our approach fares in the analysis of some
practical enclaves. \Analyser{} was able to identify real vulnerabilities on
these enclaves which have been acknowledged and fixed by their maintainers.

logarithmic density power divergence have been extremely popular and successful
in generating inference procedures which combine a high degree of model
efficiency with strong outlier stability. Such procedures are always preferable
in practical situations over procedures which achieve their robustness at a
major cost of efficiency or are highly efficient but have poor robustness
properties. The density power divergence (DPD) family of Basu et al.(1998) and
the logarithmic density power divergence (LDPD) family of Jones et al.(2001)
provide flexible classes of divergences where the adjustment between efficiency
and robustness is controlled by a single, real, non-negative parameter. The
usefulness of these two families of divergences in statistical inference makes
it meaningful to search for other related families of divergences in the same
spirit. The DPD family is a member of the class of Bregman divergences, and the
LDPD family is obtained by log transformations of the different segments of the
divergences within the DPD family. Both the DPD and LDPD families lead to the
Kullback-Leibler divergence in the limiting case as the tuning parameter
$\alpha \rightarrow 0$. In this paper we study this relation in detail, and
demonstrate that such log transformations can only be meaningful in the context
of the DPD (or the convex generating function of the DPD) within the general
fold of Bregman divergences, giving us a limit to the extent to which the
search for useful divergences could be successful.

due to noise in the human-provided traces and the presence of words that cannot
be meaningfully visually grounded. We present a novel model architecture that
is jointly trained on dual tasks (controlled trace generation and controlled

propose a local bipartite matching (LBM) distance metric which allows the
comparison of two traces of different lengths. Extensive experiments show our

state of each agent is not fully observed and the control must be decided based
on noisy observations. This results in a high-dimensional Markov decision
process that is impractical to handle directly. However, in the limit as the
number of agents approaches infinity, a finite-dimensional mean-field optimal
control problem emerges, which coincides with the problem of full information.
  Our main contribution is to investigate a central limit theorem for the
Gaussian fluctuations of the mean-field optimal control. Our findings show that
partial observations play an essential role in the fluctuations, in contrast to
the mean-field limit. We establish a method that uses an approximate Kalman
filter, which is straightforward to compute even when the number of states is
large. This provides some theoretical evidence of the efficacy of Kalman filter
methods that are commonly used across a range of practical applications. We
demonstrate our results with two examples: an epidemic model with observations

Dual-Octave convolutions (Dual-OctConv), which are connected in a dense manner
for better reuse of features. In each Dual-OctConv, the input feature maps and
convolutional kernels are first split into two components (ie, real and

  Convolution","44 pages, appears in STOC 2021",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Computing the convolution $A\star B$ of two length-$n$ vectors $A,B$ is an
ubiquitous computational primitive. Applications range from string problems to
Knapsack-type problems, and from 3SUM to All-Pairs Shortest Paths. These
applications often come in the form of nonnegative convolution, where the
entries of $A,B$ are nonnegative integers. The classical algorithm to compute
$A\star B$ uses the Fast Fourier Transform and runs in time $O(n\log n)$.
  However, often $A$ and $B$ satisfy sparsity conditions, and hence one could
hope for significant improvements. The ideal goal is an $O(k\log k)$-time
algorithm, where $k$ is the number of non-zero elements in the output, i.e.,
the size of the support of $A\star B$. This problem is referred to as sparse
nonnegative convolution, and has received considerable attention in the
literature; the fastest algorithms to date run in time $O(k\log^2 n)$.
  The main result of this paper is the first $O(k\log k)$-time algorithm for
sparse nonnegative convolution. Our algorithm is randomized and assumes that
the length $n$ and the largest entry of $A$ and $B$ are subexponential in $k$.
Surprisingly, we can phrase our algorithm as a reduction from the sparse case
to the dense case of nonnegative convolution, showing that, under some mild
assumptions, sparse nonnegative convolution is equivalent to dense nonnegative
convolution for constant-error randomized algorithms. Specifically, if $D(n)$
is the time to convolve two nonnegative length-$n$ vectors with success
probability $2/3$, and $S(k)$ is the time to convolve two nonnegative vectors
with output size $k$ with success probability $2/3$, then
$S(k)=O(D(k)+k(\log\log k)^2)$.
  Our approach uses a variety of new techniques in combination with some old
machinery from linear sketching and structured linear algebra, as well as new
insights on linear hashing, the most classical hash function.

FLARECAST had a R2O focus, and introduced several innovations into the
discipline of solar flare forecasting. FLARECAST innovations were: first, the
treatment of hundreds of physical properties viewed as promising flare
predictors on equal footing, extending multiple previous works; second, the use
of fourteen (14) different ML techniques, also on equal footing, to optimize
the immense Big Data parameter space created by these many predictors; third,
the establishment of a robust, three-pronged communication effort oriented
toward policy makers, space-weather stakeholders and the wider public.
FLARECAST pledged to make all its data, codes and infrastructure openly
available worldwide. The combined use of 170+ properties (a total of 209
predictors are now available) in multiple ML algorithms, some of which were
designed exclusively for the project, gave rise to changing sets of
best-performing predictors for the forecasting of different flaring levels. At
the same time, FLARECAST reaffirmed the importance of rigorous training and
testing practices to avoid overly optimistic pre-operational prediction
performance. In addition, the project has (a) tested new and revisited
physically intuitive flare predictors and (b) provided meaningful clues toward
the transition from flares to eruptive flares, namely, events associated with
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These leads, along with the FLARECAST data,
algorithms and infrastructure, could help facilitate integrated space-weather
forecasting efforts that take steps to avoid effort duplication. In spite of
being one of the most intensive and systematic flare forecasting efforts
to-date, FLARECAST has not managed to convincingly lift the barrier of
stochasticity in solar flare occurrence and forecasting: solar flare prediction
thus remains inherently probabilistic.

only one in which the planet has apparently been scattered. The debris disk is
nearly edge on, and extends roughly to $>$500 AU, where previous studies with
HST have shown the outer regions to have high asymmetry. To better understand
the structure and composition of the disk, we have performed a deep
polarimetric study of HD 106906's asymmetrical debris disk using newly obtained
$H$-, $J$-, and $K1$-band polarimetric data from the Gemini Planet Imager
(GPI). An empirical analysis of our data supports a disk that is asymmetrical
in surface brightness and structure, where fitting an inclined ring model to
the disk spine suggests that the disk may be highly eccentric ($e\gtrsim0.16$).
A comparison of the disk flux with the stellar flux in each band suggests a
blue color that also does not significantly vary across the disk. We discuss
these results in terms of possible sources of asymmetry, where we find that
dynamical interaction with the planet companion, HD 106906b, is a likely

  constraints",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work has unveiled a theory for reasoning about the decisions made by
binary classifiers: a classifier describes a Boolean function, and the reasons
behind an instance being classified as positive are the prime-implicants of the
function that are satisfied by the instance. One drawback of these works is
that they do not explicitly treat scenarios where the underlying data is known
to be constrained, e.g., certain combinations of features may not exist, may
not be observable, or may be required to be disregarded. We propose a more
general theory, also based on prime-implicants, tailored to taking constraints
into account. The main idea is to view classifiers in the presence of
constraints as describing partial Boolean functions, i.e., that are undefined
on instances that do not satisfy the constraints. We prove that this simple
idea results in reasons that are no less (and sometimes more) succinct. That
is, not taking constraints into account (e.g., ignored, or taken as negative
instances) results in reasons that are subsumed by reasons that do take
constraints into account. We illustrate this improved parsimony on synthetic
classifiers and classifiers learned from real data.

two-dimensional square lattice, small-world networks, Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi

minimizes the time to reach global cascades in highly clustered networks. We
also find that global information prolongs the time to hit the tipping point
but substantially compresses the time to reach global cascades after then, so
that the overall time to reach global cascades can even be shortened under
certain conditions. Finally, we show that random links substitute for global

task-invariant system state and input constraints, a parameterized environment
model generates task-specific state constraints, which are satisfied by the

using the stored data to learn generalizable control strategies. At each time
step, based on a local forecast of the new task environment, the learned
strategy consists of a target region in the state space and input constraints
to guide the system evolution to the target region. These target regions are
used as terminal sets by a low-level model predictive controller. We show how
to i) design the target sets from past data and then ii) incorporate them into
a model predictive control scheme with shifting horizon that ensures safety of
the closed-loop system when performing the new task. We prove the feasibility
of the resulting control policy, and apply the proposed method to robotic path
planning, racing, and computer game applications.

Anisotropic hydrodynamics is designed to better handle the strong and highly
anisotropic expansion during the early stages of the collision. The large
gradients cause conventional second-order viscous hydrodynamic approaches to
break down at early times. Anisotropic hydrodynamics evolves the large pressure
anisotropies present in the quark-gluon plasma non-perturbatively, which
prevents negative longitudinal pressures from developing even under extreme
conditions. This increased stability allows us to start anisotropic
hydrodynamics already at a very early longitudinal proper time to evolve the
pre-hydrodynamic stage. In current pre-hydrodynamic models, the equation of
state is not consistent with the QCD equation of state used in the subsequent
fluid dynamic stage. Since our approach avoids this inconsistency, we are able
to achieve a smooth transition to non-conformal viscous hydrodynamics as the
gradients decrease over time. For our first phenomenological application, we
apply our new simulation to model fluctuating Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies

  We give an efficient algorithm for computing optimal mechanisms, with or

time horizon is constant. Our algorithm is based on a sophisticated linear
program formulation, which can be customized in various ways to accommodate
richer constraints. For environments with large time horizons, we show that the

method is developed to calculate a block-group-level ""Border Disparity Index""

compared across the sample to examine which cities are more likely to have
borders that separate more-diverse block groups from less-diverse ones. The
index can also be used to see which core cities are relatively more or less
diverse than their suburbs, and which individual suburbs have the largest
disparities vis-\`a-vis their core city. Atlanta and Detroit have particularly

modality failures in nonlinear non-Gaussian dynamic processes. An efficient
framework to tackle this problem is proposed. In particular, a notion termed
modality ""\emph{usefulness}"", which takes a value of 1 or 0, is used for
indicating whether the observation of this modality is useful or not. For $n$
modalities involved, $2^n$ combinations of their ""\emph{usefulness}"" values
exist. Each combination defines one hypothetical model of the true data
generative process. Then the problem of concern is formalized as a task of
nonlinear non-Gaussian state filtering under model uncertainty, which is
addressed by a dynamic model averaging (DMA) based particle filter (PF)
algorithm. This DMA algorithm employs $2^n$ models, while all models share the
same state-transition function and a unique set of particle values. That makes
its computational complexity only slightly larger than a single model based PF
algorithm, especially for scenarios in which $n$ is small. Experimental results
show that the proposed solution outperforms remarkably state-of-the-art

afflicted regimes in lattice field theory, such as the presence of topological
terms, chemical potentials, and out-of-equilibrium dynamics. In this work, we
derive the (3+1)D topological $\theta$-term for Abelian and non-Abelian lattice
gauge theories in the Hamiltonian formulation, paving the way towards
Hamiltonian-based simulations of such terms on quantum and classical computers.
We further study numerically the zero-temperature phase structure of a (3+1)D
U(1) lattice gauge theory with the $\theta$-term via exact diagonalization for
a single periodic cube. In the strong coupling regime, our results suggest the
occurrence of a phase transition at constant values of $\theta$, as indicated
by an avoided level-crossing and abrupt changes in the plaquette expectation
value, the electric energy density, and the topological charge density. These
results could in principle be cross-checked by the recently developed (3+1)D
tensor network methods and quantum simulations, once sufficient resources
become available.

major challenge is that individual predictions are highly sensitive to noise in

address this, and after accounting for pretraining and finetuning noise, we
find that our BERT-Large is worse than BERT-Mini on at least 1-4% of instances

suggest that instance-level predictions provide a rich source of information;
we therefore, recommend that researchers supplement model weights with model

Milwaukee's socioeconomic conditions at the block group level. These smaller
areas' statistics are then compared with those of their corresponding ZIP

socioeconomic variables and is found to be near the extreme end of most
rankings. This ZIP code would also be among Chicago's most extreme areas, but
would lie near the middle of the rankings if located in Detroit. Parts of other
ZIP codes, which are often adjacent, are statistically similar to 53206,
however--suggesting that a focus solely on ZIP codes, while a convenient
shorthand, might overlook neighborhoods that have similar need for investment.
A multivariate index created for this study performs similarly to a standard

account, confirming that poverty and other socioeconomic stresses are
clustered, both in the 53206 ZIP code and across Milwaukee.

this non-convex problem. Finally, simulation results verify that our robust BF

solids in protoplanetary disks and trigger the formation of planetesimals. The
SI produces strong particle clumping if the ratio of solid to gas surface
density -- an effective metallicity -- exceeds a critical value. This critical
value depends on particle sizes and disk conditions such as radial
drift-inducing pressure gradients and levels of turbulence. To quantify these
thresholds, we perform a suite of vertically-stratified SI simulations over a
range of dust sizes and metallicities. We find a critical metallicity as low as
0.4% for the optimum particle sizes and standard radial pressure gradients
(normalized value of $\Pi = 0.05$). This sub-Solar metallicity is lower than
previous results due to improved numerical methods and computational effort. We
discover a sharp increase in the critical metallicity for small solids, when
the dimensionless stopping time (Stokes number) is $\leq 0.01$. We provide
simple fits to the size-dependent SI clumping threshold, including
generalizations to different disk models and levels of turbulence. We also find
that linear, unstratified SI growth rates are a surprisingly poor predictor of
particle clumping in non-linear, stratified simulations, especially when the
finite resolution of simulations is considered. Our results widen the parameter
space for the SI to trigger planetesimal formation.

""radiation-driven fountain model"" (wada2016}, which yields a geometrically
thick obscuring structure around the nucleus. This model is consistent with the
spectral energy distribution of the nearest type-2 Seyfert galaxy, the Circinus

higher transitions show absorption regions along the disk mid-plane for an
edge-on viewing angle. The spectra consist of multiple absorption and emission
features, reflecting the internal inhomogeneous and turbulent structure of the
torus. The deepest absorption feature is caused by the gas on the near-side of
the torus between $r =10$ and 15 pc, which is located in front of the
AGN-heated dust inside $r \simeq 5$ pc. We also found that a spatial resolution
of 0.5--1.0 pc is necessary to resolve the absorption features. Moreover, the
inclination angle must be close to the edge-on angle (i.e., $\sim 85^\circ$) to
observe the absorption features. The findings of the present study imply that
combining our radiation-hydrodynamic model with high-resolution observations of

the architectures that compute the embeddings, leading to compatibility-aware

aims to improve the RT failure-detection effectiveness by distributing test
cases more evenly in the input domain. Many ART algorithms have been proposed,
with Fixed-Size-Candidate-Set ART (FSCS-ART) being one of the most effective
and popular. FSCS-ART ensures high failure-detection effectiveness by selecting
the next test case as the candidate farthest from previously-executed test
cases. Although FSCS-ART has good failure-detection effectiveness, it also
faces some challenges, including heavy computational overheads. In this paper,
we propose an enhanced version of FSCS-ART, Vantage Point Partitioning ART
(VPP-ART). VPP-ART addresses the FSCS-ART computational overhead problem using
vantage point partitioning, while maintaining the failure-detection
effectiveness. VPP-ART partitions the input domain space using a modified
Vantage Point tree (VP-tree) and finds the approximate nearest executed test
cases of a candidate test case in the partitioned sub-domains -- thereby
significantly reducing the time overheads compared with the searches required
for FSCS-ART. To enable the FSCS-ART dynamic insertion process, we modify the
traditional VP-tree to support dynamic data. The simulation results show that
VPP-ART has a much lower time overhead compared to FSCS-ART, but also delivers
similar (or better) failure-detection effectiveness, especially in the higher
dimensional input domains. According to statistical analyses, VPP-ART can
improve on the FSCS-ART failure-detection effectiveness by approximately 50% to
58%. VPP-ART also compares favorably with the KDFC-ART algorithms (a series of
enhanced ART algorithms based on the KD-tree). Our experiments also show that
VPP-ART is more cost-effective than FSCS-ART and KDFC-ART.

DG is a pre-processor for pattern separation which facilitates pattern storage
and retrieval in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. The main encoding cells in
the DG are the granule cells (GCs) which receive the input from the entorhinal
cortex (EC) and send their output to the CA3. The activation degree of GCs is
so low (~ 5%). This sparsity has been thought to enhance the pattern
separation. We investigate the dynamical origin for winner-take-all (WTA)
competition which leads to sparse activation of the GCs. The whole GCs are
grouped into lamellar clusters. In each GC cluster, there is one inhibitory (I)
basket cell (BC) along with excitatory (E) GCs. There are three kinds of
external inputs into the GCs; the direct excitatory EC input, the indirect
inhibitory EC input, mediated by the HIPP (hilar perforant path-associated)
cells, and the excitatory input from the hilar mossy cells (MCs). The firing
activities of the GCs are determined via competition between the external E and
I inputs. The E-I conductance ratio ${\cal{R}}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$ (given
by the time average of the external E to I conductances) may represents well
the degree of such external E-I input competition. GCs become active when their
$\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$ is larger than a threshold ${\cal{R}}_{th}^*$,
and then the mean firing rates of the active GCs are strongly correlated with
$\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$. In each GC cluster, the feedback inhibition
of the BC may select the winner GCs. GCs with larger $\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm
(con)*}$ than the threshold ${\cal{R}}_{th}^*$ survive, and they become
winners; all the other GCs with smaller $\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$ become
silent. The WTA competition occurs via competition between the firing activity
of the GCs and the feedback inhibition from the BC in each GC cluster.

malfunction may reside in the data, and, specifically, particular properties of

assumption that weight is reported in imperial units (lbs) will malfunction
when encountering weight reported in metric units (kilograms). Similar to
software debugging, which aims to find bugs in the mechanism (source code or
runtime conditions), our goal is to debug the data to identify potential
sources of disconnect between the assumptions about the data and the systems
that operate on that data. Specifically, we seek which properties of the data
cause a data-driven system to malfunction. We propose DataExposer, a framework
to identify data properties, called profiles, that are the root causes of
performance degradation or failure of a system that operates on the data. Such
identification is necessary to repair the system and resolve the disconnect
between data and system. Our technique is based on causal reasoning through
interventions: when a system malfunctions for a dataset, DataExposer alters the
data profiles and observes changes in the system's behavior due to the
alteration. Unlike statistical observational analysis that reports mere
correlations, DataExposer reports causally verified root causes, in terms of
data profiles, of the system malfunction. We empirically evaluate DataExposer
on three real-world and several synthetic data-driven systems that fail on
datasets due to a diverse set of reasons. In all cases, DataExposer identifies
the root causes precisely while requiring orders of magnitude fewer
interventions than prior techniques.

perspective, items exhibit uneven (long-tail) distribution on the interaction
frequency; from the method perspective, collaborative filtering methods are
prone to amplify the bias by over-recommending popular items. It is undoubtedly
critical to consider popularity bias in recommender systems, and existing work
mainly eliminates the bias effect. However, we argue that not all biases in the
data are bad -- some items demonstrate higher popularity because of their
better intrinsic quality. Blindly pursuing unbiased learning may remove the
beneficial patterns in the data, degrading the recommendation accuracy and user
satisfaction.
  This work studies an unexplored problem in recommendation -- how to leverage
popularity bias to improve the recommendation accuracy. The key lies in two
aspects: how to remove the bad impact of popularity bias during training, and
how to inject the desired popularity bias in the inference stage that generates
top-K recommendations. This questions the causal mechanism of the
recommendation generation process. Along this line, we find that item
popularity plays the role of confounder between the exposed items and the
observed interactions, causing the bad effect of bias amplification. To achieve
our goal, we propose a new training and inference paradigm for recommendation
named Popularity-bias Deconfounding and Adjusting (PDA). It removes the
confounding popularity bias in model training and adjusts the recommendation
score with desired popularity bias via causal intervention. We demonstrate the
new paradigm on latent factor model and perform extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets. Empirical studies validate that the deconfounded training
is helpful to discover user real interests and the inference adjustment with
popularity bias could further improve the recommendation accuracy.

  Specifically, we show the following for graphs of $n$ nodes:
  A $(3+\epsilon)$ approximation for weighted APSP in
$(n^{1/2}+n/\delta)\tau_{mix}\cdot 2^{O(\sqrt\log n)}$ rounds in the CONGEST

its mixing time. For graphs with $\delta=\tau_{mix}\cdot 2^{\omega(\sqrt\log

graphs [Nanongkai, STOC'14].

physician actions (such as diagnosis, treatments). In medical scenarios
large-scale human annotations are usually not available, due to the high costs

deal with a limited amount of labeled data, we introduce both patient state and
physician action as latent variables with categorical priors for explicit
patient state tracking and physician policy learning, respectively. We propose
a variational Bayesian generative approach to approximate posterior
distributions over patient states and physician actions. We use an efficient
stochastic gradient variational Bayes estimator to optimize the derived

This is important because the exact values of parameters may not be known and
one would like to avoid being mislead by an output obtained using incorrect
values. Thus, it's rarely enough to address an application by formulating a
model, solving the resulting optimization problem and presenting the solution
as the answer. One would need to confirm that the model is suitable, i.e.,
""good,"" and this can, at least in part, be achieved by considering a family of
optimization problems constructed by perturbing parameters of concern. The
resulting sensitivity analysis uncovers troubling situations with unstable
solutions, which we referred to as ""bad"" models, and indicates better model
formulations. Embedding an actual problem of interest within a family of
problems is also a primary path to optimality conditions as well as
computationally attractive, alternative problems, which under ideal

develop new characterization and compilation techniques for non-Clifford gates
to accurately evaluate different quantum instruction set designs. We
specifically apply them to our fluxonium processor that supports mainstream
instruction $\mathrm{iSWAP}$ by calibrating and characterizing its square root
$\mathrm{SQiSW}$. We measure a gate fidelity of up to $99.72\%$ with an average
of $99.31\%$ and realize Haar random two-qubit gates using $\mathrm{SQiSW}$
with an average fidelity of $96.38\%$. This is an average error reduction of
$41\%$ for the former and a $50\%$ reduction for the latter compared to using
$\mathrm{iSWAP}$ on the same processor. This shows designing the quantum
instruction set consisting of $\mathrm{SQiSW}$ and single-qubit gates on such
platforms leads to a performance boost at almost no cost.

  Accountability Gadgets",,,,,"cs.CR cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For applications of Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols where
the participants are economic agents, recent works highlighted the importance
of accountability: the ability to identify participants who provably violate
the protocol. At the same time, being able to reach consensus under dynamic
levels of participation is desirable for censorship resistance. We identify an
availability-accountability dilemma: in an environment with dynamic
participation, no protocol can simultaneously be accountably-safe and live. We
provide a resolution to this dilemma by constructing a provably secure
optimally-resilient accountability gadget to checkpoint a longest chain
protocol, such that the full ledger is live under dynamic participation and the
checkpointed prefix ledger is accountable. Our accountability gadget
construction is black-box and can use any BFT protocol which is accountable
under static participation. Using HotStuff as the black box, we implemented our
construction as a protocol for the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, and our
Internet-scale experiments with more than 4000 nodes show that the protocol
achieves the required scalability and has better latency than the current
solution Gasper, which was shown insecure by recent attacks.

studies the existence of global solutions for the \emph{three-dimensional} (a

introduced in [Guo--Tice, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 207 (2013), 459--531], we
develop a new type of two-layer energy structure to overcome the difficulty
arising from three-dimensional nonlinear terms in the MHD equations, and thus
prove the initial-boundary value problem admits a unique global solution.
Moreover the solution has the exponential decay-in-time around some rest state.

large array of passive scattering elements to assist wireless communication
systems has recently attracted much attention from academia and industry. A
central issue with RIS is how much power they can effectively convey to the
target radio nodes. Regarding this question, several power level models exist
in the literature but few have been validated through experiments. In this
paper, we propose a radar cross section-based received power model for an
RIS-aided wireless communication system that is rooted in the physical
properties of RIS. Our proposed model follows the intuition that the received
power is related to the distances from the transmitter/receiver to the RIS, the
angles in the TX-RIS-RX triangle, the effective area of each element, and the
reflection coefficient of each element. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first to model the angle-dependent phase shift of the reflection
coefficient, which is typically ignored in existing literature. We further
measure the received power with our experimental platform in different
scenarios to validate our model. The measurement results show that our model is
appropriate both in near field and far field and can characterize the impact of
angles well.

identifying and extracting legally relevant elements such as contract dates,
payments, and legislation references from contracts. Automatic methods for this
task view it as a sequence labeling problem and dramatically reduce human
labor. However, as contract genres and element types may vary widely, a
significant challenge for this sequence labeling task is how to transfer
knowledge from one domain to another, i.e., cross-domain CEE. Cross-domain CEE
differs from cross-domain named entity recognition (NER) in two important ways.
First, contract elements are far more fine-grained than named entities, which
hinders the transfer of extractors. Second, the extraction zones for
cross-domain CEE are much larger than for cross-domain NER. As a result, the
contexts of elements from different domains can be more diverse. We propose a
framework, the Bi-directional Feedback cLause-Element relaTion network
(Bi-FLEET), for the cross-domain CEE task that addresses the above challenges.
Bi-FLEET has three main components: (1) a context encoder, (2) a clause-element
relation encoder, and (3) an inference layer. To incorporate invariant
knowledge about element and clause types, a clause-element graph is constructed
across domains and a hierarchical graph neural network is adopted in the
clause-element relation encoder. To reduce the influence of context variations,
a multi-task framework with a bi-directional feedback scheme is designed in the
inference layer, conducting both clause classification and element extraction.
The experimental results over both cross-domain NER and CEE tasks show that
Bi-FLEET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

of magnetic induction. These induced magnetic fields originate from
electrically conductive layers within the moons and are driven by Jupiter's
strong time-varying magnetic field. The ice giants and their moons are also
ideal laboratories for magnetic induction studies. Both Uranus and Neptune have
a strongly tilted magnetic axis with respect to their spin axis, creating a
dynamic and strongly variable magnetic field environment at the orbits of their
major moons. Although Voyager 2 visited the ice giants in the 1980s, it did not
pass close enough to any of the moons to detect magnetic induction signatures.
However, Voyager 2 revealed that some of these moons exhibit surface features
that hint at recent geologically activity, possibly associated with sub-surface
oceans. Future missions to the ice giants may therefore be capable of
discovering sub-surface oceans, thereby adding to the family of known ocean
worlds in our solar system. Here, we assess magnetic induction as a technique
for investigating sub-surface oceans within the major moons of Uranus.
Furthermore, we establish the ability to distinguish induction responses
created by different interior characteristics that tie into the induction
response: ocean thickness, conductivity, and depth, and ionospheric
conductance. The results reported here demonstrate the possibility of
single-pass ocean detection and constrained characterization within the moons

and outlier stability or robustness on the other. The logarithmic density power
divergence, a particular logarithmic transform of the density power divergence,
has also been very successful in producing efficient and stable inference
procedures; in addition it has also led to significant demonstrated
applications in information theory. The success of the minimum divergence
procedures based on the density power divergence and the logarithmic density
power divergence (which also go by the names $\beta$-divergence and
$\gamma$-divergence, respectively) make it imperative and meaningful to look
for other, similar divergences which may be obtained as transforms of the
density power divergence in the same spirit. With this motivation we search for
such transforms of the density power divergence, referred to herein as the
functional density power divergence class. The present article characterizes
this functional density power divergence class, and thus identifies the
available divergence measures within this construct that may be explored
further for possible applications in statistical inference, machine learning
and information theory.

symmetries, asymptotic behavior of the Jost function and scattering matrix, the
matrix RH problem with ZBCs and NZBCs are constructed. Then the obtained RH

previous results obtained by Park for $\alpha>3d+1$, and by Ginibre, Grossmann,

application, we prove the persistence of the phase transition when we add a
polynomial decaying magnetic field with power $\delta>0$ as $h^*|x|^{-\delta}$,
where $h^* >0$. For $d<\alpha<d+1$, the phase transition occurs when
$\delta>d-\alpha$, and when $h^*$ is small enough over the critical line
$\delta=d-\alpha$. For $\alpha \geq d+1$, $\delta>1$ it is enough to prove the
phase transition, and for $\delta=1$ we have to ask $h^*$ small. The natural
conjecture is that this region is also sharp for the phase transition problem

such a distribution can be approximated as being homogeneous on large enough
scales. Here we assess this problem by considering the size distribution of
superclusters of galaxies and by leveraging on the properties of
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, providing a novel approach which complements standard
analysis based on the correlation functions. We find that galaxy superclusters
are well described by a pure Zipf's law with no deviations and this implies
that all the catalogs currently available are not sufficiently large to spot a
truncation in the power-law behavior. This finding provides evidence that
structures larger than the greatest superclusters already observed are expected
to be found when deeper redshift surveys will be completed. As a consequence
the scale beyond which galaxy distribution crossovers toward homogeneity, if
any, should increase accordingly

However, congestions or disruptions may significantly decrease these systems'
efficiencies, making predicting and understanding the resulting train delays a
priority for railway organisations. Delays are studied in a wide variety of
models, which usually simulate trains as discrete agents carrying delays. In
contrast, in this paper, we define a novel model for studying delays, where
they spread across the railway network via a diffusion-like process. This type
of modelling has various advantages such as quick computation and ease of
applying various statistical tools like spectral methods, but it also comes
with limitations related to the directional and discrete nature of delays and
the trains carrying them. We apply the model to the Belgian railways and study
its performance in simulating the delay propagation in severely disrupted
railway situations. In particular, we discuss the role of spatial aggregation
by proposing to cluster the Belgian railway system into sets of stations and
adapt the model accordingly. We find that such aggregation significantly
increases the model's performance. For some particular situations, a
non-trivial optimal level of spatial resolution is found on which the model
performs best. Our results show the potential of this type of delay modelling
to understand large-scale properties of railway systems.

attributed to the fact that the pion-mass dependence of the pion-nucleon

consistently yield negative $\delta_{3D1}$, contrary to the lattice QCD results
which are positive but consistent with zero. The present study is relevant to a

to the measurement problem plaguing orthodox quantum mechanics. They have, a
priori nothing in common. At a formal level, collapse models add a non-linear
noise term to the Schr\""odinger equation, and extract definite measurement
outcomes either from the wave function (e.g. mass density ontology) or the
noise itself (flash ontology). Bohmian mechanics keeps the Schr\""odinger
equation intact but uses the wave function to guide particles (or fields),
which comprise the primitive ontology. Collapse models modify the predictions
of orthodox quantum mechanics, whilst Bohmian mechanics can be argued to
reproduce them. However, it turns out that collapse models and their primitive
ontology can be exactly recast as Bohmian theories. More precisely, considering
(i) a system described by a non-Markovian collapse model, and (ii) an extended
system where a carefully tailored bath is added and described by Bohmian
mechanics, the stochastic wave-function of the collapse model is exactly the
wave-function of the original system conditioned on the Bohmian hidden
variables of the bath. Further, the noise driving the collapse model is a
linear functional of the Bohmian variables. The randomness that seems
progressively revealed in the collapse models lies entirely in the initial
conditions in the Bohmian-like theory. Our construction of the appropriate bath
is not trivial and exploits an old result from the theory of open quantum
systems. This reformulation of collapse models as Bohmian theories brings to
the fore the question of whether there exists `unromantic' realist
interpretations of quantum theory that cannot ultimately be rewritten this way,
with some guiding law. It also points to important foundational differences
between `true' (Markovian) collapse models and non-Markovian models.

in this work, we introduce a practical digital forensic tool to detect

with only a small number of training samples that can work well in real-world

to be protected. By making use of decoy constants and a key-based scheme, a
reverse engineer adversary at an untrusted foundry is rendered incapable of
discerning true constants from decoy constants. The time-multiplexed constant

One major problem affecting the performance of DML algorithms is presence of

which results in under-utilization of the training data that is stored in them.
Towards this, gradient coding mitigates the impact of stragglers by adding
sufficient redundancy in the data. Gradient coding and other straggler
mitigation schemes assume that the straggler behavior of the worker nodes is
identical. Our experiments on the Amazon AWS cluster however suggest otherwise
and we see that there is a correlation in the straggler behavior across
iterations. To model this, we introduce a heterogeneous straggler model where
nodes are categorized into two classes, slow and active. To better utilize

depth, however, the vortex interaction alters, and the superconducting state
re-enters the Bose-insulating state. As a consequence, one observes a direct

e.g., the relic abundance of dark matter. This paper presents sensitivity
studies of chargino pair production, considering scenarios for both a Bino-like

pair production up to the kinematic limit of $\sqrt{s}/2$ for both scenarios.
The results have a minor dependence on the reconstruction model and detector

learn from scratch, tabula rasa, accepting a cold-start problem in self-play.
Recently, a warm-start enhancement method for Monte Carlo Tree Search was
proposed to improve the self-play starting phase. It employs a fixed parameter
$I^\prime$ to control the warm-start length. Improved performance was reported
in small board games. In this paper we present results with an adaptive switch
method. Experiments show that our approach works better than the fixed
$I^\prime$, especially for ""deep,"" tactical, games (Othello and Connect Four).
We conjecture that the adaptive value for $I^\prime$ is also influenced by the
size of the game, and that on average $I^\prime$ will increase with game size.
We conclude that AlphaZero-like deep reinforcement learning benefits from
adaptive rollout based warm-start, as Rapid Action Value Estimate did for
rollout-based reinforcement learning 15 years ago.

history of a study area and follow the evolution of potential hydrocarbon
source rocks, reservoirs and closures.
  Most current restoration methods rely on finite-element codes which require a
mesh that conforms to both horizons and faults, a difficult object to generate
in complex structural settings. Some innovative approaches use implicit horizon
representations to circumvent meshing requirements. In all cases,
finite-element restoration codes depend on elasticity theory which relies on
mechanical parameters to characterize rock behavior during the physical
unfolding process.
  In this paper, we present a geometric restoration method based on the
mathematical theory provided by the GeoChron framework. No assumption is made
on the extent of deformation, nor on the nature of terrains being restored.
Equations derived from the theory developed for the GeoChron model ensure model
consistency at each restored stage.
  As the only essential input is a GeoChron model, this restoration technique
does not require any specialist knowledge and can be included in any existing
structural model-building workflow as a standard validation tool. A model can
quickly be restored to any desired stage without providing input mechanical
parameters for each layer nor defining boundary conditions, enabling geologists
to iterate on the structural model and refine their interpretations until they
are satisfied with both input and restored models.

nitrides possess a unique crystal structure in which single-atom-thick A
sublayers are interleaved by two dimensional MX slabs, providing nanostructured
templates for designing 2D ferromagnetic materials if the non-magnetic A
sublayers can be substituted replaced by magnetic elements. Here, we report
three new ternary magnetic MAX phases (Ta2FeC, Ti2FeN and Nb2FeC) with A
sublayers of single-atom-thick 2D iron through an isomorphous replacement
reaction of MAX precursors (Ta2AlC, Ti2AlN and Nb2AlC) with a Lewis acid salts
(FeCl2). All these MAX phases exhibit ferromagnetic (FM) behavior. The Curie
temperature (Tc) of Ta2FeC and Nb2FeC MAX phase are 281 K and 291 K,
respectively, i.e. close to room temperature. The saturation magnetization of
these ternary magnetic MAX phases is almost two orders of magnitude higher than
that of V2(Sn,Fe)C MAX phase whose A-site is partial substituted by Fe.
Theoretical calculations on magnetic orderings of spin moments of Fe atoms in
these nanolaminated magnetic MAX phases reveal that the magnetism can be mainly
ascribed to intralayer exchange interaction of the 2D Fe atomic layers. Owning
to the richness in composition of MAX phases, there is a large compositional

achieve this by designing a compact model architecture that maximally reduces

adopt knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. We consider a large network as an

student, which is the lightweight network, is then trained to mimic the
teacher's predictions. However, this KD process can be challenging and
insufficient due to the large model capacity gap between the teacher and the

KD, enabling the student to better learn from the teacher's predictions. This
approach helps fill the gap between the teacher and the student, resulting in
improved data-driven learning. Our extensive experiments show that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while using only 1%

highly relies on the parameter $\Delta$. There have also been lots of
algorithms with theoretical bounds, such as Radius-stepping, but they either

practice.
  We propose a stepping algorithm framework that generalizes existing
algorithms such as $\Delta$-stepping and Radius-stepping. The framework allows
for similar analysis and implementations of all stepping algorithms. We also
propose a new ADT, lazy-batched priority queue (LaB-PQ), that abstracts the
semantics of the priority queue needed by the stepping algorithms. We provide
two data structures for LaB-PQ, focusing on theoretical and practical
efficiency, respectively. Based on the new framework and LaB-PQ, we show two
new stepping algorithms, $\rho$-stepping and $\Delta^*$-stepping, that are
simple, with non-trivial worst-case bounds, and fast in practice.
  The stepping algorithm framework also provides almost identical
implementations for three algorithms: Bellman-Ford, $\Delta^*$-stepping, and
$\rho$-stepping. We compare our code with four state-of-the-art
implementations. On five social and web graphs, $\rho$-stepping is 1.3--2.5x
faster than all the existing implementations. On two road graphs, our
$\Delta^*$-stepping is at least 14\% faster than existing implementations,
while $\rho$-stepping is also competitive. The almost identical implementations
for stepping algorithms also allow for in-depth analyses and comparisons among
the stepping algorithms in practice.

devoted to the optimization of the headway time in case of platform

increase the load rate of trains; while the TOM is devoted to the minimization
of trains' delays. The two modules interact with each other so that the headway

human vision that is robust to various data corruptions such as blur and
pixelation, current pose estimators are easily confused by these corruptions.
This work comprehensively studies and addresses this problem by building
rigorous robust benchmarks, termed COCO-C, MPII-C, and OCHuman-C, to evaluate
the weaknesses of current advanced pose estimators, and a new algorithm termed
AdvMix is proposed to improve their robustness in different corruptions. Our
work has several unique benefits. (1) AdvMix is model-agnostic and capable in a
wide-spectrum of pose estimation models. (2) AdvMix consists of adversarial
augmentation and knowledge distillation. Adversarial augmentation contains two
neural network modules that are trained jointly and competitively in an
adversarial manner, where a generator network mixes different corrupted images
to confuse a pose estimator, improving the robustness of the pose estimator by
learning from harder samples. To compensate for the noise patterns by
adversarial augmentation, knowledge distillation is applied to transfer clean
pose structure knowledge to the target pose estimator. (3) Extensive
experiments show that AdvMix significantly increases the robustness of pose
estimations across a wide range of corruptions, while maintaining accuracy on

around low-mass stars. However, the detection of such planets is challenged by
the short-term activity of the host stars. Aims. The HArps-N red Dwarf
Exoplanet Survey (HADES) program is a long-term project at the Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo aimed at the monitoring of nearby, early-type, M dwarfs,
using the HARPS-N spectrograph to search for small, rocky planets. Methods. A
total of 174 HARPS-N spectroscopic observations of the M0.5V-type star GJ 9689
taken over the past seven years have been analysed. We combined these data with
photometric measurements to disentangle signals related to the stellar activity
of the star from possible Keplerian signals in the radial velocity data. We run
an MCMC analysis, applying Gaussian Process regression techniques to model the
signals present in the data. Results. We identify two periodic signals in the
radial velocity time series, with periods of 18.27 d, and 39.31 d. The analysis
of the activity indexes, photometric data, and wavelength dependency of the
signals reveals that the 39.31 d signal corresponds to the stellar rotation
period. On the other hand, the 18.27 d signal shows no relation to any activity
proxy or the first harmonic of the rotation period. We, therefore, identify it
as a genuine Keplerian signal. The best-fit model describing the newly found
planet, GJ 9689 b, corresponds to an period P$_{\rm b}$ = 18.27 $\pm$ 0.01 d,
and a minimum mass M$_{\rm P}\sin i$ = 9.65 $\pm$ 1.41 M$_{\oplus}$.

and can be immune to disorder or de-fects if lasing occurs in topologically
protected states. Previously reported topological lasers were almost
exclu-sively based on the first-order photonic topological insulators. Here, we
show that lasing can be achieved in the zero-dimensional corner state in a
second-order photonic topological insulator, which is based on Kagome
wave-guide array with a rhombic configuration. If gain is present in the corner
of the structure, where topological corner state resides, stable lasing in this
state is achieved, with lowest possible threshold, in the presence of uniform
loss-es and two-photon absorption. When gain acts in other corners of the
structure, lasing may occur in edge or bulk states, but it requires
substantially larger thresholds and transition to stable lasing occurs over
much larger propa-gation distances, sometimes due to instabilities, which are
absent for lasing in corner states. We find that increasing two-photon
absorption generally plays strong stabilizing action for nonlinear lasing
states. The transition to stable lasing stimulated by noisy inputs is
illustrated. Our work demonstrates the realistic setting for corner state laser
based on higher-order topological insulator realised with waveguide arrays.

the robustness of the interference process that underlies this phenomenon
against the harmful effects of decoherence. Here, without losing any
generality, for simplicity, the case of a particle with a mass m is considered
and described by a localized state corresponding to the ground state of a
square box of width w, which is released inside a wider cavity (with a width L
> w). The effects of decoherence are then numerically investigated by means of
a simple dynamical model that captures the essential features of the phenomenon
under Markovian conditions, leaving aside extra complications associated with a
more detailed dynamical description of the system-environment interaction. As
it is shown, this model takes into account and reproduces the fact that
decoherence effects are stronger as energy levels become more separated (in
energy), which translates into a progressive collapse of the energy density
matrix to its main diagonal. However, because energy dissipation is not
considered, an analogous behavior is not observed in the position
representation, where a proper spatial localization of the probability density
does not take place, but rather a delocalized distribution. This result
emphasizes the fact that classicality is reached only if both decoherence and
dissipation coexist; otherwise, non-classical traits might still persist.
Actually, as it is also shown, in the position representation some off-diagonal
correlations indeed survive unless an additional spatial-type factor is
included in the model. This makes evident the rather complex nature of the
decoherence phenomenon and hence the importance to have a familiarity with how
it manifests in different representations, particularly with the purpose to
determine and design reliable control mechanisms.

relevance, for it has proven to be an efficient and useful resource to tackle,
explore, describe and explain such phenomena. This practical aspect emerges
precisely when the pragmatic application of the formalism prevails over any
other interpretational question, still a matter of debate and controversy. In
this regard, the purpose here is to show and discuss how Bohmian mechanics
emphasizes in a natural manner a series of dynamical features difficult to find
out through other quantum approaches. This arises from the fact that Bohmian
mechanics allows us to establish a direct link between the dynamics exhibited
by quantum systems and the local variations of the quantum phase associated
with their state. To illustrate these facts, simple models of two physically
insightful quantum phenomena have been chosen, namely, the dispersion of a free
Gaussian wave packet and Young-type two-slit interference. As it is shown, the
outcomes from their analysis render a novel, alternative understanding of the
dynamics displayed by these quantum phenomena in terms of the underlying local
velocity field that connects the probability density with the quantum flux.
This field, nothing but the so-called guidance condition in standard Bohmian
mechanics, thus acquires a prominent role to understand quantum dynamics, as
the mechanism responsible for such dynamics. This goes beyond the passive role
typically assigned to this field in Bohmian mechanics, where traditionally
trajectories and quantum potentials have received more attention instead.

Lacking understanding of the the dynamic relationships and interactions among

videos and questions are embedded by pre-trained models firstly to obtain the
visual and textual features. Then a graph-based relation encoder is utilized to
extract the static relationship between visual objects. To capture the dynamic
changes of multimodal objects in different video frames, we consider the
temporal, spatial, and semantic relations, and fuse the multimodal features by
hierarchical attention mechanism to predict the answer. We conduct extensive

propose a simple yet accurate method to estimate the buckling strength of
stretch-dominated lattice structures based on individual member analysis. As an
integral part of the method, the yield strength is also determined. This
simplified model is verified by rigorous numerical analysis. In particular, we
efficiently compute the complete buckling strength surfaces of an orthotropic
bulk modulus optimal plate lattice structure and isotropic stiffness optimal
plate and truss lattice structures subjected to rotated uni-axial loads, where
the ratio between the highest and lowest buckling strength is found to be 1.77,
2.11 and 2.41, respectively. For comparison, we also provide their yield
strength surfaces, where the corresponding ratios are 1.84, 1.16 and 1.79.
Furthermore, we use the knowledge gained from the simplified model to create a
new configuration of the isotropic plate lattice structure with a more
isotropic buckling strength surface and buckling strength ratio of 1.24,
without deterioration of the stiffness or yield strength. The proposed method
provides a valuable tool to quickly estimate the microstructural buckling
strength of stretch-dominated lattice structures, especially for applications

mimic either the black hole (BH) horizon if the flow transits from the

flow transits from the supercritical to the subcritical regime. We study then,
the wave propagation in the flow with two horizons when the flow transits first
the BH horizon and then the WH one. The region between the horizons mimics a
wormhole in general relativity. For the sake of completeness, we also study the
successive transition through WH and BH horizons. The theoretical results are
illustrated by numerical calculations of wave propagation in both these

distances between a given pattern of length $m$ and all length-$m$ substrings
of a given text of length $n\ge m$. We focus on the $k$-mismatch version of the
problem, where a distance needs to be returned only if it does not exceed a
threshold $k$. We assume $n\le 2m$ (in general, one can partition the text into
overlapping blocks). In this work, we show data structures for the dynamic
version of this problem supporting two operations: An update performs a
single-letter substitution in the pattern or the text, and a query, given an
index $i$, returns the Hamming distance between the pattern and the text
substring starting at position $i$, or reports that it exceeds $k$.
  First, we show a data structure with $\tilde{O}(1)$ update and $\tilde{O}(k)$
query time. Then we show that $\tilde{O}(k)$ update and $\tilde{O}(1)$ query
time is also possible. These two provide an optimal trade-off for the dynamic
$k$-mismatch problem with $k \le \sqrt{n}$: we prove that, conditioned on the
strong 3SUM conjecture, one cannot simultaneously achieve $k^{1-\Omega(1)}$
time for all operations.
  For $k\ge \sqrt{n}$, we give another lower bound, conditioned on the Online
Matrix-Vector conjecture, that excludes algorithms taking $n^{1/2-\Omega(1)}$
time per operation. This is tight for constant-sized alphabets: Clifford et al.
(STACS 2018) achieved $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ time per operation in that case,
but with $\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ time per operation for large alphabets. We
improve and extend this result with an algorithm that, given $1\le x\le k$,
achieves update time $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{k} +\sqrt{\frac{nk}{x}})$ and query
time $\tilde{O}(x)$. In particular, for $k\ge \sqrt{n}$, an appropriate choice
of $x$ yields $\tilde{O}(\sqrt[3]{nk})$ time per operation, which is
$\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ when no threshold $k$ is provided.

in Weyl semimetals and give a more general view into this problem. Besides, we
also find that when a topological Dirac semimetal is confined in its rotational
symmetry axis, it hosts both quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall states, in
which the helical edge states are protected by the conservation of the spin-$z$
component.

can be mostly produced by a hot corona gas in the accreting black holes. There
is a very popular hybrid disk radial coupling model that the inner part of cool
Keplerian disk (or Shakura-Sunyaev disk) can produce advection-dominated
accretion flow or corona-like structure, which can also generate outflows/jets.
Here we argue that this simple coupling model cannot explain the whole
hardness-intensity diagram of the spectral states and their transitions, and
associated jets of a $X-$ray binary. Based on recent theoretical works on
advective disk structures around a black hole, as well as many observational
behaviors of a source, we conclude that there should be a third component of
hot accretion flow with the radial coupling model, which can successfully
explain all the spectral states and transitions. Interestingly, this model also
provides a new scenario for the jet generation, launching, and evolution during
the states with help of created barrier of the inner flow. We have also find
out the jet kinetic power expression with our new jet generation scenario.

strengths promise SNR benefits but face specific absorption rate limits and
shortened T2 times. This study investigates compartmental T2 times in vivo and
addresses advantages and challenges of multi-component T2-mapping at 7T. We
acquired 3D multi-echo GraSE data in seven healthy adults at 7T, with three
subjects scanned also at 3T. Stimulated echoes arising from B+1 inhomogeneities
were accounted for by the extended phase graph (EPG) algorithm. We used the
computed T2 distributions to determine T2 times that identify different water
pools and assessed signal-to-noise and fit-to-noise characteristics of the
signal estimation. We compared short T2 fractions and T2 properties of the
intermediate water pool at 3T and 7T. Flip angle mapping confirmed that EPG
accurately determined the larger inhomogeneity at 7T. Multi-component T2
analysis demonstrated shortened T2 times at 7T compared to 3T. Fit-to-noise and
signal-to-noise ratios were improved at 7T but depended on B1 homogeneity.
Lowering the shortest T2 to 8 ms and adjusting the T2 threshold that separates
different water compartments to 20 ms, yielded short T2 fractions at 7T that
conformed to 3T data. Short T2 fractions in myelin-rich white matter regions
were lower at 7T than at 3T, and higher in iron-rich structures. Adjusting the
T2 compartment boundaries was required due to the shorter T2 relaxation times
at 7T. Shorter echo spacing would better sample the fast decaying signal but
would increase peripheral nerve stimulation. We used a multi-echo 3D-GraSE
sequence to characterize the multi-exponential T2 decay at 7T. We adapted T2
parameters for evaluation of the short T2 fraction. Obtained 7T multicomponent
T2-maps were in good agreement with 3T data.

Measurements are performed in terms of strains, loads and local pressure. The
study highlights the significant changes in the strains and, more in general,
in the structural behaviour when varying the plate stiffness and the test
conditions. For some of the test presented, permanent deformations are also
found. The strong fluid-structure interaction is analysed by comparing the
simultaneous measurements of strains and pressures, and it is shown that the
deformation of the plate leads to a reduction of the pressure peak and to a
corresponding pressure rise behind it. The variation in the shape of the spray
root caused by the structural deformation are discussed based on both pressure
measurements and underwater images. Despite the reduction of the pressure peak
intensity, it is shown that the structural deformation leads to an increase in
the total loading up to 50% for the test conditions examined in this study. It
is also observed that in presence of large structural deformations the
hydrodynamic loads do not obey the scaling that works in the case of the thick
plates, and some practical conclusions about the scaling of tests in presence
of a strong fluid-structure interaction are provided.

state-of-the-art methods AlexNet, VGG-16, Inception V3, Resnet-18, and
DenseNet-121. The results showed that SizeNet provides much higher accuracy
rates for object recognition than the other algorithms. SizeNet can solve the
two problems of correctly recognizing objects with highly similar features but
real sizes that are obviously different from each other, and correctly
distinguishing a target object from interference objects whose real sizes are
obviously different from the target object. This is because SizeNet recognizes
objects based not only on their features, but also on their real size. The real
size of an object can help exclude the interference object's categories whose
real size ranges do not match the real size of the object, which greatly
reduces the object's categories' number in the label set used for the
downstream object recognition based on object features. SizeNet is of great
significance for studying the interpretable computer vision. Our code and

  length observations","31 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A single server commences its service at time zero every day. A random number
of customers decide when to arrive to the system so as to minimize the waiting
time and tardiness costs. The costs are proportional to the waiting time and
the tardiness with rates $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively. Each customer's
optimal arrival time depends on the others' decisions, thus the resulting
strategy is a Nash equilibrium. This work considers the estimation of the ratio
$\displaystyle\theta\equiv \beta/(\alpha+\beta)$ from queue length data
observed daily at discrete time points, given that customers use a Nash
equilibrium arrival strategy. A method of moments estimator is constructed from
the equilibrium conditions. Remarkably, the method does not require estimation
of the Nash equilibrium arrival strategy itself, or even an accurate estimate
of its support. The estimator is strongly consistent and the estimation error
is asymptotically normal. Moreover, the asymptotic variance of the estimation
error as a function of the queue length covariance matrix (at sampling times)
is derived. The estimator performance is demonstrated through simulations, and
is shown to be robust to the number of sampling instants each day.

techniques are developed for the topological interpretation of Modal Logic. The
Spatial Logic of Closure Spaces, SLCS, extends Modal Logic with reachability
connectives that, in turn, can be used for expressing interesting spatial
properties, such as ""being near to"" or ""being surrounded by"". SLCS constitutes
the kernel of a solid logical framework for reasoning about discrete space,
such as graphs and digital images, interpreted as quasi discrete closure
spaces. Following a recently developed geometric semantics of Modal Logic, we
propose an interpretation of SLCS in continuous space, admitting a geometric
spatial model checking procedure, by resorting to models based on polyhedra.
Such representations of space are increasingly relevant in many domains of
application, due to recent developments of 3D scanning and visualisation
techniques that exploit mesh processing. We introduce PolyLogicA, a geometric
spatial model checker for SLCS formulas on polyhedra and demonstrate
feasibility of our approach on two 3D polyhedral models of realistic size.
Finally, we introduce a geometric definition of bisimilarity, proving that it
characterises logical equivalence.

one's own success. However, when two such ""selfish"" learners interact with each

a selfish opponent. Moreover, we consider the dynamics that arise when learning
rules themselves are subject to evolutionary pressure. By combining extensive
simulations and analytical techniques, we demonstrate that selfish learning is
unstable in most classical two-player repeated games. If evolution operates on
the level of long-run payoffs, selection instead favors learning rules that
incorporate social (other-regarding) preferences. To further corroborate these
results, we analyze data from a repeated prisoner's dilemma experiment. We find
that selfish learning is insufficient to explain human behavior when there is a
trade-off between payoff maximization and fairness.

capabilities of quantum algorithms with special attention paid to a
hardware-efficient variational eigensolver. A delicate interplay between
magnetic interactions allows one to stabilize a chiral state that destroys the
homogeneity of magnetic ordering, thus making this solution highly entangled.
Quantifying entanglement in terms of quantum concurrence, we argue that, while

protecting user privacy. Additionally, many legal provisions clearly stipulate
that users have the right to demand model providers to delete their own data
from training set, that is, the right to be forgotten. The naive way of
unlearning data is to retrain the model without it from scratch, which becomes
extremely time and resource consuming at the modern scale of deep neural
networks. Other unlearning approaches by refactoring model or training data
struggle to gain a balance between overhead and model usability.
  In this paper, we propose an approach, dubbed as DeepObliviate, to implement
machine unlearning efficiently, without modifying the normal training mode. Our
approach improves the original training process by storing intermediate models
on the hard disk. Given a data point to unlearn, we first quantify its temporal
residual memory left in stored models. The influenced models will be retrained
and we decide when to terminate the retraining based on the trend of residual
memory on-the-fly. Last, we stitch an unlearned model by combining the
retrained models and uninfluenced models. We extensively evaluate our approach
on five datasets and deep learning models. Compared to the method of retraining
from scratch, our approach can achieve 99.0%, 95.0%, 91.9%, 96.7%, 74.1%

we improve 5.8% accuracy, 32.5$\times$ prediction speedup, and reach a
comparable retrain speedup under identical settings on average on these

unlearning verification.

external influence, and for individual users, the retweet h-index influence. We
apply the proposed approach to three years of Twitter data of all Slovenian

right-leaning communities and users exhibit significantly higher impact. An
interesting observation is that retweet networks change relatively gradually,

areas of research among which navigation engineering. By performing this task
accurately, it is possible to significantly increase general navigation
performance by correctly filtering out the deterministic and stochastic
measurement errors that characterize such devices. While different techniques
are available to model and remove the deterministic errors, there has been
considerable research over the past years with respect to modelling the
stochastic errors which have complex structures. In order to do the latter,
different replicates of these error signals are collected and a model is
identified and estimated based on one of these replicates. While this procedure
has allowed to improve navigation performance, it has not yet taken advantage
of the information coming from all the other replicates collected on the same
sensor. However, it has been observed that there is often a change of error
behaviour between replicates which can also be explained by different
(constant) external conditions under which each replicate was taken. Whatever
the reason for the difference between replicates, it appears that the model
structure remains the same between replicates but the parameter values vary. In
this work we therefore consider and study the properties of different
approaches that allow to combine the information from all replicates
considering this phenomenon, confirming their validity both in simulation
settings and also when applied to real inertial sensor error signals. By taking
into account parameter variation between replicates, this work highlights how
these approaches can improve the average navigation precision as well as obtain
reliable estimates of the uncertainty of the navigation solution.

generate high-quality realistic images. However, despite current success, it
still faces important challenges when applied to small domains. Existing
methods use transfer learning for I2I translation, but they still require the
learning of millions of parameters from scratch. This drawback severely limits
its application on small domains. In this paper, we propose a new transfer
learning for I2I translation (TransferI2I). We decouple our learning process
into the image generation step and the I2I translation step. In the first step
we propose two novel techniques: source-target initialization and
self-initialization of the adaptor layer. The former finetunes the pretrained
generative model (e.g., StyleGAN) on source and target data. The latter allows
to initialize all non-pretrained network parameters without the need of any
data. These techniques provide a better initialization for the I2I translation
step. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary GAN that further facilitates the
training of deep I2I systems even from small datasets. In extensive experiments
on three datasets, (Animal faces, Birds, and Foods), we show that we outperform
existing methods and that mFID improves on several datasets with over 25
points.

NLP-based methods model layout analysis as a sequence labeling task and show
insufficient capabilities in layout modeling. CV-based methods model layout

VSR supports both NLP-based and CV-based methods. Specifically, we first
introduce vision through document image and semantics through text embedding
maps. Then, modality-specific visual and semantic features are extracted using
a two-stream network, which are adaptively fused to make full use of
complementary information. Finally, given component candidates, a relation
module based on graph neural network is incorported to model relations between
components and output final results. On three popular benchmarks, VSR
outperforms previous models by large margins. Code will be released soon.

propose the framework of Local and Global Pyramid Mask Alignment, which adopts
the soft pyramid mask learning mechanism in both the local and global feature

integrated to compromise the local and global information and refine the

minimization problem by jointly optimizing time allocation, HAP energy
beamforming, receiving beamforming, user transmit power allocation, IRS energy
reflection coefficient and information reflection coefficient under the
imperfect CSI and non-linear energy harvesting model. On account of the high
coupling of optimization variables, the formulated problem is a non-convex

applied to decouple the optimization variables to solve the problem.
Specifically, through AO, time allocation, HAP energy beamforming, receiving

be solved alternately. The difference-of-convex (DC) programming is used to
solve the non-convex rank-one constraint in solving IRS energy reflection

we excavate the implicit task, character counting within the traditional text
recognition, without additional labor annotation cost. The implicit task plays
as an auxiliary branch for complementing the sequential recognition. We design
a two-branch reciprocal feature learning framework in order to adequately
utilize the features from both the tasks. Through exploiting the complementary
effect between explicit and implicit tasks, the feature is reliably enhanced.
Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks show the advantages of the proposed
methods in both text recognition and the new-built character counting tasks. In
addition, it is convenient yet effective to equip with variable networks and
tasks. We offer abundant ablation studies, generalizing experiments with deeper
understanding on the tasks. Code is available.

capture the shape variation and reduce the effect of object scale on the
cytoplasm segmentation network. The generated scales are then fed into a
pyramid of cytoplasm networks to learn the segmentation map in various scales.

its strangeness content. The inclusion of a isovector-vector interaction is
essential to obtain large $s$-quark contents and a smaller central speed of
sound, although this interaction pushes the onset of quarks to larger
densities. It is observed that low mass stars, with a mass below 1.4$M_\odot$,
may contain a quark core but with small strangeness content. It is shown that
the presently existing mass and tidal deformability constraints from NS

retrieval (VCMR) is to retrieve a temporal moment (i.e., a fraction of a video)

two distinct feature spaces, there are two general approaches to address VCMR:
(i) to separately encode each modality representations, then align the two
modality representations for query processing, and (ii) to adopt fine-grained
cross-modal interaction to learn multi-modal representations for query
processing. While the second approach often leads to better retrieval accuracy,
the first approach is far more efficient. In this paper, we propose a Retrieval

adopt the first approach and introduce two contrastive learning objectives to
refine video encoder and text encoder to learn video and text representations
separately but with better alignment for VCMR. The video contrastive learning
(VideoCL) is to maximize mutual information between query and candidate video
at video-level. The frame contrastive learning (FrameCL) aims to highlight the

Experimental results show that, although ReLoCLNet encodes text and video
separately for efficiency, its retrieval accuracy is comparable with baselines

$g_{a \gamma}$ for axion mass $m_a < 10^{-10} \, \rm{eV}$ by several orders of

terrain. Deficiencies have been found when tall canopies are represented in
numerical simulations by an increase in roughness length at the surface.
Methods of explicitly modelling a forest canopy are not commonly available in
community numerical weather prediction models. In this work, such a method is
applied to the community Weather Research and Forecasting model. Simulations
are carried out to replicate a wind-tunnel experiment of neutral boundary-layer
flow across a forested ridge. It is shown that features of the flow, such as
the separated region on the lee slope of the ridge, are reproduced by the
roughness length or canopy model methods. Shear at the top of the ridge
generates turbulence that spreads vertically as the flow moves downstream in
both cases, but is elevated to canopy top where a canopy model is used. The
roughness-length approach is shown to suffer several deficiencies, such as an
over-prediction of mean wind-speeds, a lack of turbulence over flat forested
ground and an insufficient vertical extent of turbulence at all locations of
the domain studied. Sensitivity to the horizontal resolution of the simulation
is explored. It is found that higher resolution simulations improve
reproduction of the mean flow when modelling the canopy explicitly. However,
higher resolutions do not provide improvements for the roughness-length case
and lead to a reduction in the horizontal extent of the separated region of
flow on the lee slope of the ridge.

entanglement, detection and quantification of which still remains a difficult
problem from both theoretical and experimental point of view. Although many
efforts have been devoted toward the detection of multipartite entanglement
(e.g., using entanglement witnesses), measuring the degree of multipartite
entanglement, in general, requires some knowledge about an exact shape of a
density matrix of the quantum state. An experimental reconstruction of such
density matrix can be done by full state tomography which amounts to having the
distant parties share a common reference frame and well calibrated devices.
Although this assumption is typically made implicitly in theoretical works,
establishing a common reference frame, as well as aligning and calibrating
measurement devices in experimental situations are never trivial tasks. It is
therefore an interesting and important question whether the requirements of
having a shared reference frame and calibrated devices can be relaxed. In this
work we study both theoretically and experimentally the genuine concurrence for
the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states under randomly chosen
measurements on a single qubits without a shared frame of reference and
calibrated devices. We present the relation between genuine concurrence and
so-called nonlocal volume, a recently introduced indicator of nonlocality.

world. Cohorting patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) into ""bubbles""
has been proposed as an infection-control mechanism. In this paper, we present
a novel and flexible model for clustering patient care in healthcare facilities
into bubbles in order to minimize infection spread. Our model aims to control a
variety of costs to patients/residents and HCPs so as to avoid hidden,
downstream adverse effects of clustering patient care. This model leads to a
discrete optimization problem that we call the BubbleClustering problem. This
problem takes as input a temporal visit graph, representing HCP mobility,
including visits by HCPs to patient/resident rooms. The output of the problem
is a rewired visit graph, obtained by partitioning HCPs and patient rooms into
bubbles and rewiring HCP visits to patient rooms so that patient-care is
largely confined to the constructed bubbles. Even though the BubbleClustering
problem is intractable in general, we present an integer linear programming
(ILP) formulation of the problem that can be solved optimally for problem
instances that arise from typical hospital units and long-term-care facilities.
We call our overall solution approach Cost-aware Rewiring of Networks (CoRN).
We evaluate CoRN using fine-grained-movement data from a
hospital-medical-intensive-care unit as well as two long-term-care facilities.
These data were obtained using sensor systems we built and deployed. The main
takeaway from our experimental results is that it is possible to use CoRN to
substantially reduce infection spread by cohorting patients and HCPs without
sacrificing patient-care, and with minimal excess costs to HCPs in terms of
time and distances traveled during a shift.

behavior. Here, we study a model system of freely-jointed chains of three to

and rotational diffusivity follow the Kirkwood-Riseman scaling. Their maximum
flexibility does not depend on the length of the chain, but is determined by
the near-wall in-plane translational diffusion coefficient of an individual

the rise of quantum technologies promises a host of advantages in computational
problems, typically in terms of the scaling of requisite resources such as time

quantum implementations of deterministic HMMs exhibiting superior memory and

advantages of current quantum implementations do not always hold. Here, we
provide a systematic prescription for constructing quantum implementations of
non-deterministic HMMs that re-establish the quantum advantages against this

suffers from thermal dissipation due to its need to process information in a

  welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stab1408",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The turbulent dynamics of nearby and extragalactic gas structures can be
studied with the column density power spectrum, which is often described by a
broken power-law.In an extragalactic context, the breaks in the power spectra
have been interpreted to constrain the disc scale height, which marks a
transition from 2D disc-like to 3D motion. However, this interpretation has
recently been questioned when accounting for instrumental effects. We use
numerical simulations to study the spatial power spectra of isolated galaxies
and investigate the origins of the break scale. We split the gas into various
phases and analyze the time evolution of the power spectrum characteristics,
such as the slope(s) and the break scale. We find that the break scale is phase
dependent. The physics traced by the break scale also differ: in the warm gas
it marks the transition from 2D (disk-like) to 3D (isotropic) turbulence. In
the cold gas, the break scale traces the typical size of molecular clouds. We
further show that the break scale almost never traces the disc scale height. We
study turbulent properties of the ISM to show that, in the case where the break
scale traces a transition to isotropic turbulence, the fraction of required
accretion energy to sustain turbulent motions in the ISM increases
significantly. Lastly, we demonstrate through simulated observations that it is
crucial to account for observational effects, such as the beam and instrumental
noise, in order to accurately recover the break scale in real observations.

machines. The input to the model includes a set of jobs and a set of machine
types. Each job has a size and a time interval during which it should be
processed. Each job is to be placed on a machine for execution. Different types
of machines have distinct capacities and cost rates. The total size of the jobs
running on a machine must always be kept within the machine's capacity, giving
rise to placement restrictions for jobs of various sizes among the machine
types. Each machine used is charged according to the time duration in which it
is busy, i.e., it is processing jobs. The objective is to schedule the jobs
onto machines to minimize the total cost of all the machines used. We develop
an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm in the offline setting and an
$O(\mu)$-competitive algorithm in the online setting (where $\mu$ is the
max/min job length ratio), both of which are asymptotically optimal.

was studied with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in the radio and the
Chandra space telescope in X-rays. Apart from the north-northwestern jet
component seen in both the VLA and Chandra images at $2.3''$ separation from
the core, there is another X-ray feature at $6.48''$ in the northeastern (NE)
direction. To uncover more details and possibly structural changes in the inner
jet, we conducted new observations at 5 GHz using the European VLBI Network
(EVN) in 2019. These data confirm the northward direction of the one-sided
inner jet already suspected from the 1992 observations. A compact core and
multiple jet components were identified that can be traced up to $\sim0.25$ kpc
projected distance towards the north, while the structure becomes more and more
diffuse. A comparison with arcsec-resolution imaging with the VLA shows that
the radio jet bends by $\sim30^\circ$ between the two scales. The direction of
the pc-scale jet as well as the faint optical counterpart found for the

We show at leading order that including more than one species of leptoquarks,
large cubic interactions with the Higgs can lead to sizable enhancement of
di-Higgs production cross section at LHC, while at the same time keeping other
Higgs observables and precision measurements under control. For masses above
800 GeV these corrections are in general below 30%, whereas in a viable

residuals and bias in the primordial $B$-modes. At these noise levels,
$\sigma(r)$ is not especially sensitive to the level of foreground

superior soft-tissue contrast and no ionization radiation compared to CT-based
planning. In this regard, synthetic CT (sCT) images should be generated from
the patients MRI scans if radiation treatment planning is sought. Among the
different available methods for this purpose, the deep learning algorithms have
and do outperform their conventional counterparts. In this study, we
investigated the performance of some most popular deep learning architectures
including eCNN, U-Net, GAN, V-Net, and Res-Net for the task of sCT generation.
As a baseline, an atlas-based method is implemented to which the results of the
deep learning-based model are compared. A dataset consisting of 20
co-registered MR-CT pairs of the male pelvis is applied to assess the different
sCT production methods' performance. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error
(MAE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), structural similarity index
(SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics were computed between the
estimated sCT and the ground truth (reference) CT images. The visual inspection
revealed that the sCTs produced by eCNN, V-Net, and ResNet, unlike the other
methods, were less noisy and greatly resemble the ground truth CT image. In the
whole pelvis region, the eCNN yielded the lowest MAE (26.03-8.85 HU) and ME
(0.82-7.06 HU), and the highest PCC metrics were yielded by the eCNN
(0.93-0.05) and ResNet (0.91-0.02) methods. The ResNet model had the highest
PSNR of 29.38-1.75 among all models. In terms of the Dice similarity
coefficient, the eCNN method revealed superior performance in major tissue
identification (air, bone, and soft tissue). All in all, the eCNN and ResNet
deep learning methods revealed acceptable performance with clinically tolerable
quantification errors.

user-item pairs that are positively-related but have not been interacted yet,
where only a small portion of positive user-item interactions (e.g., users'
implicit feedback) are observed. For discriminative modeling between positive
and negative interactions, most previous work relied on negative sampling to
some extent, which refers to considering unobserved user-item pairs as
negative, as actual negative ones are unknown. However, the negative sampling
scheme has critical limitations because it may choose ""positive but unobserved""
pairs as negative. This paper proposes a novel OCCF framework, named as BUIR,
which does not require negative sampling. To make the representations of
positively-related users and items similar to each other while avoiding a
collapsed solution, BUIR adopts two distinct encoder networks that learn from
each other; the first encoder is trained to predict the output of the second
encoder as its target, while the second encoder provides the consistent targets
by slowly approximating the first encoder. In addition, BUIR effectively
alleviates the data sparsity issue of OCCF, by applying stochastic data
augmentation to encoder inputs. Based on the neighborhood information of users
and items, BUIR randomly generates the augmented views of each positive
interaction each time it encodes, then further trains the model by this
self-supervision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BUIR consistently
and significantly outperforms all baseline methods by a large margin especially
for much sparse datasets in which any assumptions about negative interactions
are less valid.

vision techniques have been applied in detecting cracks in concrete structures.
However, they suffer from variances in light conditions and shadows, lacking
robustness and resulting in many false positives. To address the uncertainty in
vision, human inspectors actively touch the surface of the structures, guided
by vision, which has not been explored in autonomous crack detection. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach to detect and reconstruct cracks in concrete
structures using vision-guided active tactile perception. Given an RGB-D image
of a structure, the rough profile of the crack in the structure surface will
first be segmented with a fine-tuned Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, and a
set of contact points are generated to guide the collection of tactile images
by a camera-based optical tactile sensor. When contacts are made, a pixel-wise
mask of the crack can be obtained from the tactile images and therefore the
profile of the crack can be refined by aligning the RGB-D image and the tactile
images. Extensive experiment results have shown that the proposed method
improves the effectiveness and robustness of crack detection and reconstruction
significantly, compared to crack detection with vision only, and has the
potential to enable robots to help humans with the inspection and repair of the

fractions and production cross section per unit of rapidity at midrapidity
($|y|<0.5$), in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV at the LHC. The latter
is ${\rm d} \sigma^{\rm c \overline{c}}/{\rm d} y|_{|y| < 0.5}$ =1165 $\pm
44(\rm{stat})^{+134}_{-101}(\rm{syst})$ $\mu b$. These measurements were
obtained for the first time in hadronic collisions at the LHC including the
charm baryon states, recently measured by ALICE at midrapidity. The charm
fragmentation fractions differ significantly from the values measured in
e$^+$e$^-$ and ep collisions, providing evidence of the dependence of the
parton-to-hadron fragmentation fractions on the collision system, indicating
that the assumption of their universality is not supported by the measured
cross sections. An increase of a factor of about 3.3 for the fragmentation
fraction for the $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ with a significance of $5\,\sigma$
between the values obtained in pp collisions and those obtained in e$^+$e$^-$
(ep) collisions is reported. The fragmentation fraction for the $\Xi_{\rm c}^0$
was obtained for the first time in any collision system. The measured
fragmentation fractions were used to update the $\rm c \overline{c}$ cross
sections per unit of rapidity at $|y|<0.5$ at $\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ and 7 TeV,
which are about 40% higher than the previously published results. The data were
compared with perturbative-QCD calculations and lie at the upper edge of the
theoretical bands.

Accepted to AJ",,"10.3847/1538-3881/ac00a9",,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Transit surveys have revealed a significant population of compact
multi-planet systems, containing several sub-Neptune-mass planets on close-in,
tightly-packed orbits. These systems are thought to have formed through a final
phase of giant impacts, which would tend to leave systems close to the edge of
stability. Here, we assess this hypothesis, comparing observed eccentricities
in systems exhibiting transit-timing variations (TTVs), with the maximum
eccentricities compatible with long-term stability. We use the machine-learning
classifier SPOCK (Tamayo et al. 2020) to rapidly classify the stability of
numerous initial configurations and hence determine these stability limits.
While previous studies have argued that multi-planet systems are often
maximally packed, in the sense that they could not host any additional planets,
we find that the existing planets in these systems have measured eccentricities
below the limits allowed by stability by a factor of 2--10. We compare these
results against predictions from the giant impact theory of planet formation,
derived from both $N$-body integrations and theoretical expectations that in
the absence of dissipation, the orbits of such planets should be distributed
uniformly throughout the phase space volume allowed by stability. We find that
the observed systems have systematically lower eccentricities than this
scenario predicts, with a median eccentricity about 4 times lower than
predicted. These findings suggest that if such systems formed through giant
impacts, then some dissipation must occur to damp their eccentricities. This
may take place during formation, perhaps through interactions with the natal
gas disk or a leftover population of planetesimals, or over longer timescales
through the coupling of tidal and secular processes.

ionization of helium into the azimuthal plane are calculated using the

to identify single and double scattering mechanisms. In general, our results
predict that the ionization dynamics for vortex projectiles are similar to
those of their non-vortex counterparts. However, some key differences are
observed. For non-vortex projectiles, a double scattering mechanism is required
to emit electrons into the azimuthal plane, and this mechanism becomes more
important with increasing energy. Our results demonstrate that for vortex
projectiles, emission into the azimuthal plane does not require a double
scattering mechanism, although this process still significantly influences the
shape of the TDCS at higher energies. At low projectile energies, non-vortex
ionization proceeds primarily through single binary collisions. The same is
generally true for vortex projectiles, although our results indicate that
double scattering is also important, even at low energy. Vortex projectiles
have an inherent uncertainty in their incident momentum, which causes a
broadening of the binary peak at all energies and results in a splitting of the
binary peak at higher energies. The results presented here lead to several
predictions that can be experimentally tested.

size-adaptable and modular in-pipe robot so-called SmartCrawler that works
based on wheel wall press mechanism. We develop a two-phase motion control
algorithm that enables reliable motion in straight and non-straight
configurations of in-service pipelines. The controller in phase 1 stabilizes
the robot in the straight paths and tracks the desired velocity with high-level
linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and low-level proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) based controllers. The controller in phase 2 with a designed error-check
submodule and velocity controller, enables the robot to steer to the desired
directions at non-straight configurations. The performance of the two-phase
controller is evaluated with experimental and simulation results. Wireless
underground communication is a challenging task for underground applications.
We propose a bi-directional wireless sensor module based on active radio
frequency identification (RFID) that works in 434MHz carrier frequency and
evaluate its performance with experimental results. At the end of this work, we
design the printed circuit board (PCB) for the SmartCrawler that embeds the
electronic components in a confined and sealed environment. The simulation and
the experimental results prove the proposed robotic system can be used for in
pipe missions where wireless communication is needed to communicate with the

interactions $\sim 1/r^{\alpha}$. As a figure of merit, we employ the
tripartite mutual information (TMI), whose sign indicates if quantum
information is predominantly shared globally. Interestingly, the sign of the
TMI distinguishes regimes of the exponent $\alpha$ that are known for different
behaviour of information propagation. While an effective causal region bounds
the propagation of information, if interactions decay sufficiently fast, this
information is mainly delocalized, which leads to the necessity of global
measurements. Furthermore, the results indicate that mutual information is
monogamous for all possible partitionings in this case, implying that quantum
entanglement is the dominant correlation. If interactions decay sufficiently
slow, though information can propagate (quasi-)instantaneously, it is mainly
accessible by local measurements at early times. Furthermore, it takes some
finite time until correlations start to become monogamous, which suggests that
apart from entanglement, other nonmonogamous correlations are sizeable at early
times. Our findings give new insights into the dynamics, and structure of
quantum information in many-body systems with long-range interactions, and
might get verified on state-of-the-art experimental platforms.

Firstly, we show that the squared loss converges exponentially to its optimum

dynamics of the network parameters to lie within an invariant set. In turn,
minimizing the loss over this set leads to the min-norm solution. Finally, we
show that large hidden layer width, together with (properly scaled) random
initialization, ensures proximity to such an invariant set during training,
allowing us to derive a novel non-asymptotic upper-bound on the distance

spherical cows: day-to-night temperature contrasts range from hundreds to
thousands of degrees, rivaling their vertical temperature contrasts.
Nonetheless, the emergent spectra of short-period planets have typically been
fit using one-dimensional (1D) spectral retrieval codes that only account for
vertical temperature gradients. The popularity of 1D spectral retrieval codes
is easy to understand: they are robust and have a rich legacy in Solar System
atmospheric studies. Exoplanet researchers have recently introduced
multi-dimensional retrieval schemes for interpreting the spectra of
short-period planets, but these codes are necessarily more complex and
computationally expensive than their 1D counterparts. In this paper we present
an alternative: phase-dependent spectral observations are inverted to produce
longitudinally resolved spectra that can then be fitted using standard 1D
spectral retrieval codes. We test this scheme on the iconic phase-resolved
spectra of WASP-43b and on simulated JWST observations using the open-source
pyratbay 1D spectral retrieval framework. Notably, we take the model complexity
of the simulations one step further over previous studies by allowing for
longitudinal variations in composition in addition to temperature. We show that
performing 1D spectral retrieval on longitudinally resolved spectra is more
accurate than applying 1D spectral retrieval codes to disk-integrated emission
spectra, despite being identical in terms of computational load. We find that
for the extant Hubble and Spitzer observations of WASP-43b the difference
between the two approaches is negligible but that JWST phase measurements
should be treated with longitudinally \textbf{re}solved \textbf{spect}ral

net magnetization, the energy bands are spin-(Kramers-degenerate. The opposite
case is usually associated with a global time-reversal symmetry breaking (e.g.,
via ferro(i)magnetism), or with the spin-orbit interaction is combined with the
broken spatial inversion symmetry. Recently, another type of spin splitting was
demonstrated to emerge in some fully compensated by symmetry, nonrelativistic,
collinear magnets, and not even necessarily non-centrosymmetric. These
materials feature non-zero spin density staggered not only in real, but also in
momentum space. This duality results in a combination of characteristics
typical of ferro- and antiferromagnets. Here we discuss this novel concept in
application to a well-known semiconductor, FeSb2, and predict that upon certain
alloying it becomes magnetic, and features such magnetic duality. The
calculated energy bands split antisymmetrically with respect to spin degenerate
nodal surfaces (and not nodal points, as in the case of spin-orbit splitting.
This combination of a large (0.2 eV) spin splitting, compensated net
magnetization and metallic ground-state, and a particular magnetic easy axis
generate a large anomalous Hall conductivity (~150 S/cm) and a sizable
magneto-optical Kerr effect, all deemed to be hallmarks of nonzero net
magnetization. We identify a large contribution to the anomalous response
originating from the spin-orbit interaction gapped anti-Kramers nodal surfaces,
a mechanism distinct from the nodal lines and Weyl {\it points} in
ferromagnets.

outside the tabletop workspace, or buffers, can temporarily hold objects which
greatly facilitates the resolution of a given rearrangement task. This brings
forth the natural question of how many running buffers are required so that
certain classes of tabletop rearrangement problems are feasible. In this work,
we examine the problem for both the labeled (where each object has a specific
goal pose) and the unlabeled (where goal poses of objects are interchangeable)
settings. On the structural side, we observe that finding the minimum number of
running buffers (MRB) can be carried out on a dependency graph abstracted from
a problem instance, and show that computing MRB on dependency graphs is
NP-hard. We then prove that under both labeled and unlabeled settings, even for
uniform cylindrical objects, the number of required running buffers may grow
unbounded as the number of objects to be rearranged increases; we further show
that the bound for the unlabeled case is tight. On the algorithmic side, we
develop highly effective algorithms for finding MRB for both labeled and
unlabeled tabletop rearrangement problems, scalable to over a hundred objects
under very high object density. Employing these algorithms, empirical
evaluations show that random labeled and unlabeled instances, which more
closely mimics real-world setups, have much smaller MRBs.

of the peaks. In particular, we find that the support for both masses being

pp collisions are fitted with a modified power law and the nuclear modification
factor in PbPb collisions can be obtained using effective shift ($\Delta p_{\rm

consideration, the functional form of energy loss given by $\Delta p_{\rm T}$
can be assumed as power law with different power indices in three different
$p_{\rm T}$ regions. The power indices and the boundaries of three $p_{\rm T}$
regions are obtained by fitting the measured nuclear modification factor as a
function of $p_{\rm T}$ in all collision centralities simultaneously. The
energy loss in different collisions centralities are described in terms of
fractional power of number of participants. It is demanded that the power law
functions in three $p_T$ regions and their derivatives are continuous at the
$p_{\rm T}$ boundaries. The $\Delta p_{\rm T}$ for light charged particles is
found to increase linearly with $p_{\rm T}$ in low $p_{\rm T}$ region below
$\sim 5-6$ GeV/$c$ and approaches a constant value in high $p_{\rm T}$ region
above $\sim 22-29$ GeV/$c$ with an intermediate power law connecting the two

$\sim 10-40\%$ at a signal-to-noise ratio of $20$. Focusing on the stellar-mass
gap with new tabulations of the $^{12}\text{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \text{O}$

The original version of the Chernoff bound is to give an exponential decreasing
bound on the tail distribution of sums of independent random variables. Recent
years, several works have been done by extending the original version of the
Chernoff bound to high-dimensional random objects, e.g., random matrices,
or/and to consider the relaxation that there is no requirement of independent
assumptions among random objects. In this work, we generalize the matrix
expander Chernoff bound studied by Garg et al. at work: A Matrix Expander
Chernoff Bound, to tensor expander Chernoff bounds. Our main tool is to develop
new tensor norm inequalities based on log-majorization techniques. These new
tensor norm inequalities are used to bound the expectation of Ky Fan norm of
the random tensor exponential function, then tensor expander Chernoff bounds
can be established. Compared with the matrix expander Chernoff bound, the
tensor expander Chernoff bounds proved at this work contributes following
aspects: (1) the random objects dimensions are increased from matrices
(two-dimensional data array) to tensors (multidimensional data array); (2) this
bound generalizes the identity map of the random objects summation to any
polynomial function of the random objects summation; (3) Ky Fan norm, instead
only the maximum or the minimum eigenvalues, for the function of the random
objects summation is considered; (4) we remove the restriction about the
summation of all mapped random objects is zero, which is required in the matrix
expander Chernoff bound derivation.

Rayleigh--Taylor (RT) instability by horizontal magnetic field can be
mathematically proved in a non-resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluid in a
two-dimensional (2D) horizontal slab domain, since it had been roughly verified
by a 2D linearized motion equations in 2012 \cite{WYC}. In this paper, we find
that this inhibition phenomenon can be rigorously verified in the
inhomogeneous, incompressible, inviscid case with velocity damping. More
precisely, there exists a critical number $m_{\rm{C}}$ such that if the
strength $|m|$ of horizontal magnetic field is bigger than $m_{\rm{C}}$, then
the small perturbation solution around the magnetic RT equilibrium state is
exponentially stable in time. Our result is also the first mathematical one
based on the nonlinear motion equations for the proof of inhibition of flow
instabilities by a horizontal magnetic field in a horizontal slab domain. In
addition, we also provide a nonlinear instability result for the case $|m|\in
[0,m_{\rm{C}})$. Our instability result presents that horizontal magnetic field
can not inhibit the RT instability, if it's strength is to small.

cities themselves, however, as many of their surrounding suburbs continue to
prosper. Poverty can therefore be highly concentrated at the MSA level, but
more evenly distributed within the borders of the city proper. One result of
this disparity is that if suburbanites consider poverty to be confined to the
central city, they might be less willing to devote resources to alleviate it.
But due to recent increases in suburban poverty, particularly since the 2008
recession, such urban-suburban gaps might be shrinking. Using Census

found to be superior in assessing urban bikeability, and potentially can be

density-driven flow that joins faster flow components to create a multi-scale,
3D flow. Potential temperature and salinity are active tracers that determine
the ocean's potential density: their distribution strongly affects the
density-driven component while the overall flow affects their distribution. We
present a robust framework that allows one to study the effects of a general 3D
flow on a density-driven velocity component, by constructing a modular
observation-based 3D model of intermediate complexity. The model contains an
incompressible velocity that couples two advection-diffusion equations, for
temperature and salinity. Instead of solving the Navier-Stokes equations for
the velocity, we consider a flow composed of several temporally separated,
spatially predetermined modes. One of these modes models the density-driven
flow: its spatial form describes the density-driven flow structure and its
strength is determined dynamically by average density differences. The other
modes are completely predetermined, consisting of any incompressible, possibly
unsteady, 3D flow, e.g. as determined by kinematic models, observations, or
simulations. The model is a non-linear, weakly coupled system of two non-local
PDEs. We prove its well-posedness in the sense of Hadamard, and obtain rigorous
bounds regarding analytical solutions. The model's relevance to oceanic systems
is demonstrated by tuning the model to mimic the North Atlantic ocean's
dynamics. In one limit the model recovers a simplified oceanic box model and in
another limit a kinematic model of oceanic chaotic advection, suggesting it can
be utilized to study spatially dependent feedback processes in the ocean.

model to adapt to various relation learning, which results in the high variance
problem. Ensemble strategy could be competitive on improving the accuracy of
few-shot relation extraction and mitigating high variance risks. This paper
explores an ensemble approach to reduce the variance and introduces fine-tuning
and feature attention strategies to calibrate relation-level features. Results
on several few-shot relation learning tasks show that our model significantly
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models.

opinion mining and artificial mathematical intelligence (AMI), with public data
on the spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the incidence of COVID-19
disease in Colombia during the first three months since the first reported
positive case. The results obtained, together with conceptual tools coming from
the global taxonomy of fundamental cognitive mechanisms emerging in AMI and
with suitable contextual information from Colombian public health and
mainstream social media, allowed us to stating specific preventive guidelines
for a better restructuring of initial safe and stable life conditions in
Colombia, and in an extended manner in similar Latin American Countries. More
specifically, we describe three major guidelines: 1) regular creative
visualization and effective planning, 2) the continuous use of constructive
linguistic frameworks, and 3) frequent and moderate use of kinesthetic
routines. They should be understood as effective tools from a cognitive and
behavioural perspective, rather than from a biological one. Even more, the
first two guidelines should be acknowledged in integral cooperation with the
third one regarding the global effect of COVID-19 in human beings as a whole,
this includes the mind and body.

Despite the substantial advancement of FSO systems over the past decades, the
requirement of a line-of-sight connection between transmitter and receiver
remains a key limiting factor for their deployment. In this paper, we discuss
the potential role of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as a solution to
relax this requirement. We present an overview of existing optical IRS
technologies; compare optical IRSs with radio-frequency IRSs and optical
relays; and identify various open problems for future research on IRS-assisted
FSO communications.

reality technologies. Augmented reality glasses are used to construct holograms
of the patient's organs from MRI and CT data, subsequently transmitted to the
glasses. This, in addition to seeing the actual patient, the surgeon gains
visualization inside the patient's body (bones, soft tissues, blood vessels,
etc.). The solutions developed at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic
University allow reducing the invasiveness of the procedure and preserving
healthy tissues. This also improves the navigation process, making it easier to
estimate the location and size of the tumor to be removed. We describe the
application of developed systems to different types of surgical operations
(removal of a malignant brain tumor, removal of a cyst of the cervical spine).
We consider the specifics of novel navigation systems designed for anesthesia,
for endoscopic operations. Furthermore, we discuss the construction of novel
visualization systems for ultrasound machines. Our findings indicate that the
technologies proposed show potential for telemedicine.

aspects of modern wireless networks. At the same time, mobile edge computing
(MEC) has already shown its huge potential by extending the computation,
communication, and caching capabilities of a standalone cloud server to the
network edge. In this article, we first provide an overview of how MEC and RIS
can benefit each other. We envision that the integration of MEC and RIS will
bring an unprecedented transformation to the future evolution of wireless
networks. We provide a system-level perspective on the MEC-aided RIS (and
RIS-assisted MEC) that will evolve wireless network towards 6G. We also outline
some of the fundamental challenges that pertain to the implementation of

local area network(WLAN) applications is proposed and studied in this paper.
The antenna comprises of a T-shaped and a F-shaped element to generate two
resonant modes for dual band operation. The two elements can independently
control the operating frequencies of the two excited resonant modes. The
T-element which is fed directly by a 50 $\Omega$ microstrip line generates a
frequency band at around 5.2 GHz and the antenna parameters can be adjusted to
generate a frequency band at 5.8 GHz as well, thus covering the two higher
bands of WLAN systems individually. By couple-feeding the F-element through the
T-element, a frequency band can be generated at 2.4 GHz to cover the lower band
of WLAN system. Hence, the two elements together are very compact with a total
area of only 11$\times$6.5 mm$^{2}$. A thorough parametric study of key
dimensions in the design has been performed and the results obtained have been
used to present a generalized design approach. Plots of the return loss and
radiation pattern have been given and discussed in detail to show that the
design is a very promising candidate for WLAN applications.
