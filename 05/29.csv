applications. Therefore, estimating the AR model parameters (ARPs) of a
reference reverberation is a crucial task. Although a few recent
deep-learning-based approaches have shown promising performance, their
non-end-to-end training scheme prevents them from fully exploiting the
potential of deep neural networks. This motivates the introduction of
differentiable artificial reverberation (DAR) models, allowing loss gradients
to be back-propagated end-to-end. However, implementing the AR models with
their difference equations ""as is"" in the deep learning framework severely
bottlenecks the training speed when executed with a parallel processor like GPU
due to their infinite impulse response (IIR) components. We tackle this problem
by replacing the IIR filters with finite impulse response (FIR) approximations
with the frequency-sampling method. Using this technique, we implement three
DAR models -- differentiable Filtered Velvet Noise (FVN), Advanced Filtered
Velvet Noise (AFVN), and Delay Network (DN). For each AR model, we train its
ARP estimation networks for analysis-synthesis (RIR-to-ARP) and blind
estimation (reverberant-speech-to-ARP) task in an end-to-end manner with its
DAR model counterpart. Experiment results show that the proposed method
achieves consistent performance improvement over the non-end-to-end approaches

Ising model. These properties include an Ising-like phase transition that can
be induced by either a change in 'quantum-ness' of the theory, or by a scaling
the Ising couplings up or down. This behaviour is in accord with what is

to demonstrate the efficacy of the quantum annealer at minimising several
increasingly hard two dimensional potentials. For all the potentials we find
the general behaviour that Nelder-Mead and gradient descent methods are very
susceptible to becoming trapped in false minima, while the thermal anneal
method is somewhat better at discovering the true minimum. However, and despite
current limitations on its size, the quantum annealer performs a minimisation
very markedly better than any of these classical techniques. A quantum anneal
can be designed so that the system almost never gets trapped in a false
minimum, and rapidly and successfully minimises the potentials.

methods for testing variable statistical significance or constructing variable
confidence intervals do not apply. To address these problems, we developed a
novel permutation framework for testing the significance of variables in

it is non-parametric and does not rely on distributional assumptions or
asymptotic results. Second, it not only ranks model variables in terms of
relative importance, but also tests for statistical significance of each
variable. Third, it can test for the significance of the interaction between

bursts provide valuable information on X-ray binary systems, e.g., binary
parameters, the chemical composition of accreted matter, and the nuclear

constrain the physics of X-ray bursters. However, they have mainly focused on
the burning layers above the solid crust of the NS, which brings up issues of
the treatment of NS gravitation and internal energy. In this study, focusing on
the microphysics inside NSs, we calculate a series of X-ray bursts using a
general-relativistic stellar-evolution code with several NS EOSs. We compare
the X-ray-burst models with the burst parameters of a clocked burster
associated with GS 1826-24. We find a monotonic correlation between the NS
radius and the light-curve profile. A larger radius shows a higher recurrence
time and a large peak luminosity. In contrast, the dependence of light curves
on the NS mass becomes more complicated, where the neutrino cooling suppresses
the efficiency of nuclear ignition. We also constrain the EOS and mass of GS
1826-24, i.e., stiffer EOSs, corresponding to larger NS radii, are not
preferred due to too-high peak luminosity. The EOS and the cooling and heating
of NSs are important to discuss the theoretical and observational properties of

constrain circumstellar condensation processes and conditions in C-rich stars
and core-collapse supernovae. This study presents our findings on eight
presolar SiC grains from AGB stars (four mainstream and one Y grain) and
core-collapse supernovae (three X grains), chosen on the basis of {\mu}-Raman
spectral features that were indicative of their having unusual non-3C polytypes
and/or high degrees of crystal disorder. Analytical transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), which provides elemental compositional and structural
information, shows evidence for complex histories for the grains. Our TEM
results confirm the presence of non-3C,2H crystal domains. Minor element
heterogeneities and/or subgrains were observed in all grains analyzed for their
compositions. The C/O ratios inferred for the parent stars varied from 0.98 to
greater than or equal to 1.03. Our data show that SiC condensation can occur
under a wide range of conditions, in which environmental factors other than
temperature (e.g., pressure, gas composition, heterogeneous nucleation on
pre-condensed phases) play a significant role. Based on previous {\mu}-Raman
studies, about 10% of SiC grains may have infrared (IR) spectral features that
are influenced by crystal defects, porosity, and/or subgrains. Future
sub-diffraction limited IR measurements of complex SiC grains might shed
further light on the relative contributions of each of these features to the
shape and position of the characteristic IR 11-{\mu}m SiC feature and thus
improve the interpretation of IR spectra of AGB stars like those that produced
the presolar SiC grains.

actual knowledge and use of RE-related standards in industry. Objective: In
this article, we investigate to which extent standards and related artifacts
such as templates or guidelines are known and used by RE practitioners. Method:
To this end, we have conducted a questionnaire-based online survey. We could
analyze the replies from 90 RE practitioners using a combination of closed and
open-text questions. Results: Our results indicate that the knowledge and use
of standards and related artifacts in RE is less widespread than one might
expect from an engineering perspective. For example, about 47% of the
respondents working as requirements engineers or business analysts do not know
the core standard in RE, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148. Participants in our study mostly
use standards by personal decision rather than being imposed by their
respective company, customer, or regulator. Beyond insufficient knowledge, we
also found cultural and organizational factors impeding the widespread adoption
of standards in RE. Conclusions: Overall, our results provide empirically
informed insights into the actual use of standards and related artifacts in RE
practice and - indirectly - about the value that the current standards create
for RE practitioners.

waveforms in the context of wireless power transfer (WPT). Particularly, we
present a differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)-based WPT architecture, that
employs an analog correlator at the receiver, in order to boost the energy
harvesting (EH) performance. We take into account the nonlinearities of the EH
process and derive closed-form analytical expressions for the harvested direct
current (DC) under a generalized Nakagami-m block fading model. We show that,
in this framework, both the peak-to-average-power-ratio of the received signal
and the harvested DC, depend on the parameters of the transmitted waveform.
Furthermore, we investigate the case of deterministic unmodulated chaotic
waveforms and demonstrate that, in the absence of a correlator, modulation does
not affect the achieved harvested DC. On the other hand, it is shown that for
scenarios with a correlator-aided receiver, DCSK significantly outperforms the
unmodulated case. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCSK-based
signal design, which further enhances the WPT capability of the proposed
architecture; corresponding analytical expressions for the harvested DC are
also derived. Our results demonstrate that the proposed architecture and the
associated signal design, can achieve significant EH gains in DCSK-based WPT
systems. Furthermore, we also show that, even by taking into account the
nonlinearities at the transmitter amplifier, the proposed chaotic waveform
performs significantly better in terms of EH, when compared with the existing
multisine signals.

  Cyber-Physical Systems & Control (CPS&C'2021)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper, pelage pattern matching is considered to solve the individual
re-identification of the Saimaa ringed seals. Animal re-identification together
with the access to large amount of image material through camera traps and
crowd-sourcing provide novel possibilities for animal monitoring and
conservation. We propose a novel feature pooling approach that allow
aggregating the local pattern features to get a fixed size embedding vector
that incorporate global features by taking into account the spatial
distribution of features. This is obtained by eigen decomposition of
covariances computed for probability mass functions representing feature maps.
Embedding vectors can then be used to find the best match in the database of
known individuals allowing animal re-identification. The results show that the
proposed pooling method outperforms the existing methods on the challenging
Saimaa ringed seal image data.

focussed on one specific technique, that is the well-known connection between
branch point twist field correlators and measures of entanglement in 1+1D
integrable quantum field theory. Our papers apply this technique for the first
time to a non-diagonal theory with an involved particle spectrum, the
sine-Gordon model. In this Part II we focus on a different entanglement
measure, the symmetry resolved entanglement, and develop its associated twist
field description, exploiting the underlying U(1) symmetry of the theory. In
this context, conventional branch point twist fields are no longer the fields
required, but instead we must work with one of their composite generalisations,
which can be understood as the field resulting from the fusion of a standard
branch point twist field and the sine-Gordon exponential field associated with
U(1) symmetry. The resulting composite twist field has correlators which as
usual admit a form factor expansion. In this paper we write the associated form
factor equations and solve them for various examples in the breather sector by
using the method of angular quantisation. We show that, in the attractive
regime, this is the sector which provides the leading contribution to the
symmetry resolved entropies, both Renyi and von Neumann. We compute the latter

equipartition, that is the leading contribution to the symmetry resolved

techniques to improve the quality of the labels while attempting to reduce the

method, however, in the context of data labelling, this is not always ideal as
data labellers are not equally reliable. One might, instead, give higher

symmetry-breaking coherent structures from experimental measurements of a
turbulent axisymmetric bluff body wake. Traditional model reduction methods
decompose the field into a set of modes with fixed spatial support but
time-varying amplitudes. However, this fixed basis cannot resolve the mean flow
deformation due to variable Reynolds stresses, a central feature of Stuart's
nonlinear stability mechanism, without the further assumption of weakly
nonlinear interactions. Here, we introduce a parametric modal basis that
depends on the instantaneous value of the unsteady aerodynamic center of
pressure, which quantifies the degree to which the rotational symmetry of the
wake is broken. Thus, the modes naturally interpolate between the unstable
symmetric state and the nonlinear equilibrium. We estimate the modes from
experimental measurements of the base pressure distribution by reducing the
symmetry via phase alignment and averaging conditioned on the center of
pressure. The amplitude dependence of the symmetric mode deviates significantly
from the polynomial scaling predicted by weakly nonlinear analysis, confirming
that the parametric basis is crucial for capturing the effect of strongly
nonlinear interactions. We also introduce a second model term capturing
axisymmetric fluctuations associated with the mean-field deformation. We then
apply the Langevin regression system identification method to construct a
stochastically forced nonlinear model for these two generalized mode
coefficients. The resulting model reproduces empirical power spectra and
probability distributions, suggesting a path towards developing interpretable
low-dimensional models of globally unstable turbulent flows from experimental
measurements.

granular front and the velocity of linear gravity waves in shallow water:
transient bores for large $\mathrm{Fr}_f$, solitary waves for intermediate
values of $\mathrm{Fr}_f$, and non-linear transition waves at small
$\mathrm{Fr}_f$. The wave amplitude relative to the water depth increases with
$\mathrm{Fr}_f$ in the three regimes but with different non-linear scalings,
and the relative wavelength is an increasing or decreasing function of
$\mathrm{Fr}_f$. Two of these wave regimes are rationalized by considering that
the advancing granular front acts as a vertical piston pushing the water, while
the last one is found to be a transition from shallow to deep water conditions.
The present modeling contributes to a better understanding of the rich
hydrodynamics of the generated waves, with coastal risk assessment as practical
applications.

screening mechanism works in the case of stellar oscillation and suppresses the
monopole scalar emission to undetectable levels. In collapsing stars, we find
that the Cauchy problem, although locally well posed, can lead to diverging

about how human brain structures develop across stages of life. Developmental
scientists are particularly interested in the first few years of
neurodevelopment. Despite the success of MRI collection and analysis for
adults, it is a challenge for researchers to collect high-quality multimodal
MRIs from developing infants mainly because of their irregular sleep pattern,
limited attention, inability to follow instructions to stay still, and a lack
of analysis approaches. These challenges often lead to a significant reduction
of usable data. To address this issue, researchers have explored various
solutions to replace corrupted scans through synthesizing realistic MRIs. Among
them, the convolution neural network (CNN) based generative adversarial network
has demonstrated promising results and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
However, adversarial training is unstable and may need careful tuning of
regularization terms to stabilize the training. In this study, we introduced a
novel MRI synthesis framework - Pyramid Transformer Net (PTNet). PTNet consists
of transformer layers, skip-connections, and multi-scale pyramid
representation. Compared with the most widely used CNN-based conditional GAN
models (namely pix2pix and pix2pixHD), our model PTNet shows superior
performance in terms of synthesis accuracy and model size. Notably, PTNet does
not require any type of adversarial training and can be easily trained using
the simple mean squared error loss.

structures in captions can benefit scene graph generation. Our method captures
the information provided in captions about relations between individual
triplets, and context for subjects and objects (e.g. visual properties are

alignment between the exhaustive list of human-annotated subjects and objects

Survey to trace the matter distribution in the local Universe and to explore
the size of the flattened local density structure associated with the Local
Supercluster. The Local Supercluster is oriented almost perpendicular to the
Galactic plane. Since Galactic extinction increases towards the Galactic plane,
objects are on average more easily visible perpendicular to the plane than
close to it, also producing an apparent concentration of objects along the
Local Supercluster. We can correct for this bias by a careful treatment of the
survey selection function. We find a significant overdensity of clusters in a
flattened structure along the Supergalactic plane with a thickness of about 50
Mpc and an extent of about 100 Mpc radius. Structures at a distance larger than
100 Mpc are not correlated to the Local Supercluster any more. The matter
density contrast of the local superstructure to the surroundings is about a
factor of 1.3 - 2.3. Within the Supergalactic plane the matter is concentrated
mostly in two superclusters, the Perseus-Pisces Chain and Hydra-Centaurus
supercluster. We have shown in our earlier work that the local Universe in a
region with a radius of 100 - 170 Mpc has a lower density than the cosmic mean.
For this reason, the Local Supercluster is not overdense with respect to the
cosmic mean density. Therefore this local superstructure will not collapse as a
whole in the future, but rather fragment.

  Embeddings","Code available at https://github.com/mycal-tucker/causal-probe",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Neural language models exhibit impressive performance on a variety of tasks,
but their internal reasoning may be difficult to understand. Prior art aims to
uncover meaningful properties within model representations via probes, but it
is unclear how faithfully such probes portray information that the models
actually use. To overcome such limitations, we propose a technique, inspired by
causal analysis, for generating counterfactual embeddings within models. In
experiments testing our technique, we produce evidence that suggests some
BERT-based models use a tree-distance-like representation of syntax in
downstream prediction tasks.

of noise as possible. This work reports on measuring the impact of
environmental radiation on lifetimes of fixed frequency transmon qubits with
various capacitor pad geometries by varying the amount of shielding used in the
measurement space. It was found that the qubit lifetimes are robust against
these shielding changes until the most extreme limit was tested without a
mixing chamber shield in the refrigerator. In contrast, the quasiparticle
tunneling rates were found to be extremely sensitive to all configurations
tested, indicating these devices are not yet limited by losses related to
superconducting quasiparticles.

multivariable linear systems with a time-varying diagonal matrix gain. We show
that uncertain multivariable linear systems are stabilizable by diagonal matrix
high gains if the system matrix is an H-matrix with positive diagonal entries.
Based on matrix measure and stability theory for diagonally dominant systems,
we consider two classes of uncertain linear systems, and derive a threshold
condition to ensure their exponential stability by a monotonically increasing
diagonal gain matrix. When each individual gain function in the matrix gain is
updated by state-dependent functions using only local state information, the
boundedness and convergence of both system states and adaptive matrix gains are
guaranteed. We apply the adaptive distributed stabilization approach to
adaptive synchronization control for large-scale complex networks consisting of
nonlinear node dynamics and time-varying coupling weights. A unified framework
for adaptive synchronization is proposed that includes several general design
approaches for adaptive coupling weights to guarantee network synchronization.

discussions among users. The presence of hate speech online is becoming
increasingly problematic, making necessary the development of appropriate
countermeasures. In this work, we perform hate speech detection on a corpus of
more than one million comments on YouTube videos through a machine learning
model fine-tuned on a large set of hand-annotated data. Our analysis shows that
there is no evidence of the presence of ""serial haters"", intended as active
users posting exclusively hateful comments. Moreover, coherently with the echo
chamber hypothesis, we find that users skewed towards one of the two categories
of video channels (questionable, reliable) are more prone to use inappropriate,
violent, or hateful language within their opponents community. Interestingly,
users loyal to reliable sources use on average a more toxic language than their
counterpart. Finally, we find that the overall toxicity of the discussion
increases with its length, measured both in terms of number of comments and
time. Our results show that, coherently with Godwin's law, online debates tend
to degenerate towards increasingly toxic exchanges of views.

violating framework has been developed. Here the Very Special Relativity (VSR)
is considered. The main aspect in the VSR proposal is that laws of physics are
invariant under the subgroups of the Poincar\'e group preserving the basic
elements of special relativity. An important point is that the photon acquires
a mass. In this context, the energy-momentum tensor for the electromagnetic
field is calculated. From this, the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Casimir effect at
finite temperature in VSR are obtained. The effects of temperature are
introduced using the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism. A comparative
analysis with the Casimir effect for the standard electromagnetic case is
developed.

the ILC, a large amount of positrons have to be produced and the accelerated
particles have to be captured and matched according to the damping ring
acceptances. %There exist several technical possibilities. In this contribution
a new promising alternative method for capturing positrons will be presented,
the application of the plasma lens as an optical matching device. It will be
compared with the current matching device proposed for the ILC, namely the
quarter wave transformer. An advantage of the plasma lens is the different
magnetic field component, which focuses the divergent beam in a more effective
manner. Therefore it will be shown in this paper that the yield requirements
could be achieved more easily. The plasma lens can actually be a promising
alternative for focusing beams as soon as the technical feasibility has been
approved.\\ In the simulation, a tapered active plasma lens has been optimized
using the approximation of a homogeneous electric current density constant in
time. The optimization process led to a plasma lens design that improves on the
ILC's currently proposed optical matching device, namely the quarter wave
transformer, by approximately $50-100\%$. Furthermore the design has been shown
to guarantee a stable captured positron yield within $\pm1.5\%$ for single,
independent parameter deviations of about $\pm10\%$.

areas. However, presentation attacks, also known as spoofing techniques, can
bypass biometric authentication systems using artefacts such as printed images,
artificial eyes, textured contact lenses, etc. Many liveness detection methods
that improve the security of these systems have been proposed. The first
International Iris Liveness Detection competition, where the effectiveness of
liveness detection methods is evaluated, was first launched in 2013, and its
latest iteration was held in 2020. This paper proposes a serial architecture
based on a MobileNetV2 modification, trained from scratch to classify bona fide
iris images versus presentation attack images. The bona fide class consists of
live iris images, whereas the attack presentation instrument classes are
comprised of cadaver, printed, and contact lenses images, for a total of four
scenarios. All the images were pre-processed and weighted per class to present
a fair evaluation. This proposal won the LivDet-Iris 2020 competition using
two-class scenarios. Additionally, we present new three-class and four-class
scenarios that further improve the competition results. This approach is
primarily focused in detecting the bona fide class over improving the detection
of presentation attack instruments. For the two, three, and four classes
scenarios, an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 4.04\%, 0.33\%, and 4,53\% was obtained
respectively. Overall, the best serial model proposed, using three scenarios,
reached an ERR of 0.33\% with an Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate
(APCER) of 0.0100 and a Bona Fide Classification Error Rate (BPCER) of 0.000.

time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in two distinct ways. Firstly, the conservative

violation, captured in its simplest form by 'Model AB'. Second, the diffusive
dynamics can break TRS in its own right. This happens only at higher order in
the gradient expansion (but is the leading behaviour without reactions present)
and is captured by 'Active Model B+' (AMB+). Each of the two mechanisms can
lead to microphase separation, by quite different routes. Here we introduce
Model AB+, for which both mechanisms are simultaneously present, and show that
for slow reaction rates the system can undergo a new type of hierarchical
microphase separation, whereby a continuous phase of fluid 1 contains large
droplets of fluid 2 within which small droplets of fluid 1 are continuously
created and then absorbed into the surrounding fluid-1 phase. In this state of
'bubbly microphase separation' the small-scale 1-in-2 droplets arise by the

Laminar separation bubbles are observed over the suction side and near the
trailing edge, on the pressure side. Flow visualization and spectral analysis
are employed to investigate vortex shedding aft of the suction side separation
bubble. Vortex interaction results in merging or bursting such that coherent
structures or turbulent packets are advected towards the trailing edge leading
to different levels of noise emission. Despite the intermittent occurrence of
laminar-turbulent transition, the noise spectrum depicts a main tone with
multiple equidistant secondary tones. To understand the role of flow
instabilities on the tones, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations are examined
in its operator form through bi-global stability and resolvent analyses, and by
time evolution of disturbances using a matrix-free method. These linear global
analyses reveal amplification of disturbances over the suction side separation
bubble. Non-normality of the linear operator leads to further transient
amplification due to modal interaction among eigenvectors. Two-point, one time
autocovariance calculations of pressure along the spanwise direction elucidate
aspects of the acoustic feedback loop mechanism in the non-linear solutions.
This feedback process is self-sustained by acoustic waves radiated from the
trailing edge, which reach the most sensitive flow location between the leading
edge and the separation bubble, as identified by the resolvent analysis.
Leading edge disturbances arising from secondary diffraction and phase
interference among the most unstable frequencies computed in the eigenspectrum
are also shown to have an important role in the feedback loop.

selecting such interventions is algorithmically much more challenging, due to
the doubly-exponential combinatorial search space over sets of composite
interventions. In this paper, we develop efficient algorithms for optimizing
different objective functions quantifying the informativeness of a
budget-constrained batch of experiments. By establishing novel submodularity
properties of these objectives, we provide approximation guarantees for our
algorithms. Our algorithms empirically perform superior to both random
interventions and algorithms that only select single-variable interventions.

measure the vertical gravitational potential of the Galactic disk from the
time-varying structure of the phase-space spiral, using data from Gaia as well
as supplementary radial velocity information from legacy spectroscopic surveys.
For eleven independent data samples, we inferred gravitational potentials that
were in good agreement, despite the data samples' varied and substantial
selection effects. Using a model for the baryonic matter densities, we inferred
a local halo dark matter density of $0.0085 \pm 0.0039$ M$_\odot$/pc$^3 = 0.32
\pm 0.15$ GeV/cm$^3$. We were also able to place the most stringent constraint

upper 95 % confidence limit of roughly 5 M$_\odot$/pc$^2$ (compared to previous
limit of roughly 10 M$_\odot$/pc$^2$, given the same scale height). For the
inferred halo dark matter density and thin dark disk surface density, the
uncertainties are dominated by the baryonic model. With this level of
precision, our method is highly competitive with traditional methods that rely
on the assumption of a steady state. In a general sense, this illustrates that
time-varying dynamical structures are not solely obstacles to dynamical mass
measurements, but can also be regarded as assets containing useful information.

serves as the backbone of our framework. We then accelerate iPGM by taking
long, but safeguarded, rank-one steps generated by fast nonlinear programming

after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures
struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or
even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor
tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention
Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores
memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing
high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing
detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can
therefore ""mentally time-travel"" -- remember past events in detail without
attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM
substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks
requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include
recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to
navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining
new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much
longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a
meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves
agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that
previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards
agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended

detect$\gamma$-ray counterparts to neutrino alerts with a rate of approximately
one per year. It has been proposed that the high-energy diffuse neutrino flux
can be explained by $\sim$ 5\% of all blazars flaring in neutrinos once every
10 years, with a neutrino luminosity similar to that of TXS 0506+056 during the
2014-2015 neutrino flare. The implementation of our strategy could lead, over a

In general, the ability to cope with a broad spectrum of unseen test inputs is
called generalization. Generalization is definitely important in applications

there are also cases where the possible inputs are few and unlabeled but known

introduce a framework for targeted deep learning, and we devise and test an

clusters are the most likely heat source to solve the cooling flow problem. One
way for this heating to occur is through generation of a turbulent cascade by
jet-inflated bubbles. Measurements of the X-ray intensity power spectra show
evidence of this cascade in different regions of the cluster, constraining the
role of driving mechanisms. We analyze feedback simulations of the Perseus
cluster to constrain the effect of the jet activity on the intensity
fluctuations and kinematics of the cluster atmosphere. We find that, within the
inner 60 kiloparsecs, the power spectra of the predicted surface brightness
fluctuations are broadly consistent with those measured by Chandra and that
even a single episode of jet activity can generate a long-lasting imprint on
the intensity fluctuations in the innermost region of the cluster. AGN-driven
motions within the same region approach the values reported by Hitomi during
and right after the AGN episode. However, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion
excited by the jet in simulations underpredicts the Hitomi measurement. This
indicates that driving a volume-filling sustained level of turbulence requires
several episodes of jet activity, and/or additional processes drive turbulence
outside the 60-kpc sphere. This also suggests that sharp edges of the bubbles
in the innermost region of the cluster contribute substantially to the
intensity of fluctuations, consistent with the Perseus observations in the
inner 30-kpc region. We discuss new diagnostics to decompose annular power
spectra to constrain past episodes of jet activity.

e-commerce services such as display advertisement and online shopping. With the
rapid development of these services in the last two decades, users have
accumulated a massive amount of behavior data. Richer sequential behavior data
has been proven to be of great value for sequential recommendation. However,
traditional sequential models fail to handle users' lifelong sequences, as
their linear computational and storage cost prohibits them from performing
online inference. Recently, lifelong sequential modeling methods that borrow
the idea of memory networks from NLP are proposed to address this issue.
However, the RNN-based memory networks built upon intrinsically suffer from the
inability to capture long-term dependencies and may instead be overwhelmed by
the noise on extremely long behavior sequences. In addition, as the user's
behavior sequence gets longer, more interests would be demonstrated in it. It
is therefore crucial to model and capture the diverse interests of users. In
order to tackle these issues, we propose a novel lifelong incremental
multi-interest self attention based sequential recommendation model, namely
LimaRec. Our proposed method benefits from the carefully designed
self-attention to identify relevant information from users' behavior sequences
with different interests. It is still able to incrementally update users'
representations for online inference, similarly to memory network based
approaches. We extensively evaluate our method on four real-world datasets and
demonstrate its superior performances compared to the state-of-the-art
baselines.

compute the expected bounds on triple-path interference at JUNO and demonstrate
that they are comparable to those already available from electromagnetic

due to an intrinsic independence from any boundary conditions, whereas such
dependence on boundary conditions is always present in the case of
electromagnetic probes. Thus, neutrino oscillations present an ideal probe of
this aspect of the foundations of quantum mechanics.

The total number of the orbits amounts to 152. Numerical calculations were
performed to evaluate the evolution of the orbits over 100,000-year time
interval with projects for the future. Six bodies are found to have moved from
the 2:1 commensurability zone to the Centaur population. The transfer time of
these bodies to the Centaur zone ranges from 4,600 to 70,000 yr. Such transfers
occur after orbits leave the resonance and the bodies approach Jupiter. Where
after reaching sufficient orbital eccentricities bodies approach a terrestrial
planet, their orbits go out of the MMR. Accuracy estimations are carried out to
confirm the possible asteroid transfers to the Centaur region.

two recently well-studied models of modified loop quantum cosmologies (mLQCs),
which arise from different regularizations of the Hamiltonian constraint and
show the robustness of a generic resolution of the big bang singularity,
replaced by a quantum bounce due to non-perturbative Planck scale effects. As
in loop quantum cosmology (LQC), in these modified models the slow-roll
inflation happens generically. We consider the cosmological perturbations
following the dressed and hybrid approaches and clarify some subtle issues
regarding the ambiguity of the extension of the effective potential of the
scalar perturbations across the quantum bounce, and the choice of initial
conditions. Both of the modified regularizations yield primordial power spectra
that are consistent with current observations for the Starobinsky potential
within the framework of either the dressed or the hybrid approach. But
differences in primordial power spectra are identified among the mLQCs and LQC.
In addition, for mLQC-I, striking differences arise between the dressed and
hybrid approaches in the infrared and oscillatory regimes. While the
differences between the two modified models can be attributed to differences in
the Planck scale physics, the permissible choices of the initial conditions and
the differences between the two perturbation approaches have been reported for

modeling tasks from natural language processing to recommendation, due to its

memory complexities, prohibiting its applications on long sequences. Existing
approaches that address this issue mainly rely on a sparse attention context,
either using a local window, or a permuted bucket obtained by
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) or sorting, while crucial information may be
lost. Inspired by the idea of vector quantization that uses cluster centroids
to approximate items, we propose LISA (LInear-time Self Attention), which
enjoys both the effectiveness of vanilla self-attention and the efficiency of
sparse attention. LISA scales linearly with the sequence length, while enabling
full contextual attention via computing differentiable histograms of codeword
distributions. Meanwhile, unlike some efficient attention methods, our method
poses no restriction on casual masking or sequence length. We evaluate our
method on four real-world datasets for sequential recommendation. The results
show that LISA outperforms the state-of-the-art efficient attention methods in
both performance and speed; and it is up to 57x faster and 78x more memory

the outputs of the embedded ODE layers are computed numerically with

show that mathematical model order reduction methods can be used for

novel compression method by developing Neural ODEs that integrate the necessary
subspace-projection and interpolation operations as layers of the neural

SVD-based weight truncation methods from the literature in image and
time-series classification tasks. The methods are evaluated by acceleration
versus accuracy when adjusting the level of compression. On this spectrum, we
achieve a favourable balance over existing methods by using model order
reduction when compressing a convolutional Neural ODE. In compressing a

significant improvement in recent years, most of which can be credited to the
fact that a sizeable amount of data is available to train models on, and the

made significant progress with the availability of open datasets with reliable

by treating the slice spatial dimension separately, spatiotemporal models can

capabilities of learning specific spatial and temporal relationship, while
reducing computational costs. This paper uses two spatiotemporal models, ResNet
(2+1)D and ResNet Mixed Convolution, to classify different types of brain
tumours. It was observed that both these models performed superior to the pure

pre-training the models on a different, even unrelated dataset before training

its a priori interpretation, offers new views to philosophy and pedagogy of

(ii) it supports the thesis that in modern mathematics the Weyl's system of

learning agent recovers a reward function using expert demonstrations. Most of
the existing IRL techniques make the often unrealistic assumption that the
agent has access to full information about the environment. We remove this
assumption by developing an algorithm for IRL in partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs). The algorithm addresses several limitations of
existing techniques that do not take the information asymmetry between the
expert and the learner into account. First, it adopts causal entropy as the
measure of the likelihood of the expert demonstrations as opposed to entropy in
most existing IRL techniques, and avoids a common source of algorithmic
complexity. Second, it incorporates task specifications expressed in temporal
logic into IRL. Such specifications may be interpreted as side information
available to the learner a priori in addition to the demonstrations and may
reduce the information asymmetry. Nevertheless, the resulting formulation is
still nonconvex due to the intrinsic nonconvexity of the so-called forward
problem, i.e., computing an optimal policy given a reward function, in POMDPs.
We address this nonconvexity through sequential convex programming and
introduce several extensions to solve the forward problem in a scalable manner.
This scalability allows computing policies that incorporate memory at the
expense of added computational cost yet also outperform memoryless policies. We
demonstrate that, even with severely limited data, the algorithm learns reward
functions and policies that satisfy the task and induce a similar behavior to
the expert by leveraging the side information and incorporating memory into the
policy.

regression function (for example, inference on the conditional mean
$\mathbb{E}[Y|X]$) is more challenging. In the setting where the features $X$
are continuously distributed, recent work has established that any confidence
interval for $\mathbb{E}[Y|X]$ must have non-vanishing width, even as sample

achievable if and only if the effective support size of the distribution of $X$

task in text mining. The most challenging part of this task arguably lies in
uncommon, emerging, and domain-specific phrases. The infrequent nature of these
phrases significantly hurts the performance of phrase mining methods that rely
on sufficient phrase occurrences in the input corpus. Context-aware tagging
models, though not restricted by frequency, heavily rely on domain experts for
either massive sentence-level gold labels or handcrafted gazetteers. In this
work, we propose UCPhrase, a novel unsupervised context-aware quality phrase
tagger. Specifically, we induce high-quality phrase spans as silver labels from
consistently co-occurring word sequences within each document. Compared with
typical context-agnostic distant supervision based on existing knowledge bases
(KBs), our silver labels root deeply in the input domain and context, thus
having unique advantages in preserving contextual completeness and capturing
emerging, out-of-KB phrases. Training a conventional neural tagger based on
silver labels usually faces the risk of overfitting phrase surface names.
Alternatively, we observe that the contextualized attention maps generated from
a transformer-based neural language model effectively reveal the connections
between words in a surface-agnostic way. Therefore, we pair such attention maps
with the silver labels to train a lightweight span prediction model, which can
be applied to new input to recognize (unseen) quality phrases regardless of
their surface names or frequency. Thorough experiments on various tasks and
datasets, including corpus-level phrase ranking, document-level keyphrase
extraction, and sentence-level phrase tagging, demonstrate the superiority of
our design over state-of-the-art pre-trained, unsupervised, and distantly

lot of success in generating realistic and diverse data. These approaches
define a forward diffusion process for transforming data to noise and generate
data by reversing it (thereby going from noise to data). Unfortunately, current
score-based models generate data very slowly due to the sheer number of score
network evaluations required by numerical SDE solvers.
  In this work, we aim to accelerate this process by devising a more efficient
SDE solver. Existing approaches rely on the Euler-Maruyama (EM) solver, which
uses a fixed step size. We found that naively replacing it with other SDE
solvers fares poorly - they either result in low-quality samples or become
slower than EM. To get around this issue, we carefully devise an SDE solver
with adaptive step sizes tailored to score-based generative models piece by
piece. Our solver requires only two score function evaluations, rarely rejects
samples, and leads to high-quality samples. Our approach generates data 2 to 10
times faster than EM while achieving better or equal sample quality. For
high-resolution images, our method leads to significantly higher quality
samples than all other methods tested. Our SDE solver has the benefit of
requiring no step size tuning.

variance function in GARCH models when the true parameter may lie on the

Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cram\'{e}r-von Mises type, and are based on a certain
empirical process marked by centered squared residuals. The limiting
distributions of the test statistics are not free from (unknown) nuisance
parameters, and hence critical values cannot be tabulated. A novel bootstrap
procedure is proposed to implement the tests; it is shown to be asymptotically
valid under general conditions, irrespective of the presence of nuisance
parameters on the boundary. The proposed bootstrap approach is based on
shrinking of the parameter estimates used to generate the bootstrap sample
toward the boundary of the parameter space at a proper rate. It is simple to
implement and fast in applications, as the associated test statistics have
simple closed form expressions. A simulation study demonstrates that the new
tests: (i) have excellent finite sample behavior in terms of empirical
rejection probabilities under the null as well as under the alternative; (ii)
provide a useful complement to existing procedures based on Ljung-Box type
approaches. Two data examples are considered to illustrate the tests.

present two adversarial attack vectors that more accurately reflect the label

under our multimodal noisy labels model, state-of-the-art approaches for

we propose a multi-stage, labeler-aware, model-agnostic framework that reliably
filters noisy labels by leveraging knowledge about which data partitions were

each time, a new vertex attaches itself to a collection of existing vertices
via a fixed number $m \ge 1$ of edges, with probability proportional to an
attachment function $f$ of their degree. It was shown in \cite{BBpersistence}
that such network models exhibit two regimes: (i) the persistent regime,
corresponding to $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}f(i)^{-2} < \infty$, where the top $K$
maximal degree vertices fixate over time for any given $K$, and (ii) the
non-persistent regime, with $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}f(i)^{-2} = \infty$, where the
identities of these vertices keep changing infinitely often over time. We
develop root finding algorithms using the empirical degree structure and local
network information based on a snapshot of such a network at some large time.
In the persistent regime, the algorithm is purely based on degree centrality,
that is, for a given error tolerance $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, there exists
$K_{\varepsilon}$ such that for any $n \ge 1$, the confidence set for the root
in $\mathcal G_n$, which contains the root with probability at least $1 -
\varepsilon$, consists of the top $K_{\varepsilon}$ maximal degree vertices. In
particular, the size of the confidence set is stable in the network size. Upper
and lower bounds on $K_{\varepsilon}$ are explicitly characterized in terms of
the error tolerance $\varepsilon$ and the attachment function $f$. In the
non-persistent regime, for an appropriate choice of $r_n \rightarrow \infty$ at
a rate much smaller than the diameter of the network, the neighborhood of
radius $r_n$ around the maximal degree vertex is shown to contain the root with
high probability, and a size estimate for this set is obtained. It is shown
that, when $f(k) = k^{\alpha}, k \ge 1,$ for any $\alpha \in (0,1/2]$, this
size grows at a smaller rate than any positive power of the network size.

$z = 0.702$ galaxy ($\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 10.05^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$) is
detected out to $\approx$25 kpc from the central galaxy and covers

\;\mathrm{arcsec}^2$). The MgII emission around this highly inclined galaxy
($\simeq$75 deg) is strongest along the galaxy's projected minor axis,
consistent with the MgII gas having been ejected from the galaxy into a
bi-conical structure. The quasar sightline, which is aligned with the galaxy's
minor axis, shows strong MgII $\lambda$2796 absorption (EW$_0$ = 1.8A) at an
impact parameter of 39kpc from the galaxy. Comparing the kinematics of both the
emission and the absorption - probed with VLT/UVES -, to the expectation from a
simple toy model of a bi-conical outflow, we find good consistency when
assuming a relatively slow outflow ($v_\mathrm{out}=
130\;\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). We investigate potential origins of the
extended MgII emission using simple toy models. With continuum scattering
models we encounter serious difficulties in explaining the luminosity of the
MgII halo and in reconciling density estimates from emission and absorption.
Instead, we find that shocks might be a more viable source to power the
extended MgII (and non-resonant [OII]) emission.

$k$-induction, which (i) generalizes classical $k$-induction for verifying

of monotonic maps on complete lattices, and (iii) extends from naturals $k$ to
transfinite ordinals $\kappa$, thus yielding $\kappa$-induction. The
lattice-theoretic understanding of $k$-induction and BMC enables us to apply
both techniques to the fully automatic verification of infinite-state

group stars according to IR excess, based on WISE W1-W3 color, as an indicator

materials, has emerged as an important area for the application of
reinforcement learning (RL) strategies to derive control policies for physical
systems. In active materials, non-linear dynamics and long-range interactions
between particles prohibit closed-form descriptions of the system's dynamics
and prevent explicit solutions to optimal control problems. Due to fundamental
challenges in solving for explicit control strategies, RL has emerged as an
approach to derive control strategies for far-from-equilibrium active matter
systems. However, an important open question is how the mathematical structure
and the physical properties of the active matter systems determine the
tractability of RL for learning control policies. In this work, we show that RL
can only find good strategies to the canonical active matter task of mixing for
systems that combine attractive and repulsive particle interactions. Using
mathematical results from dynamical systems theory, we relate the availability
of both interaction types with the existence of hyperbolic dynamics and the
ability of RL to find homogeneous mixing strategies. In particular, we show
that for drag-dominated translational-invariant particle systems, hyperbolic
dynamics and, therefore, mixing requires combining attractive and repulsive
interactions. Broadly, our work demonstrates how fundamental physical and
mathematical properties of dynamical systems can enable or constrain

increase of the size and heterogeneity of data available to learning systems.
As a consequence, the key issue of Continual Learning has become that of
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma of connectionist systems, as they
need to adapt their model without forgetting previously acquired knowledge.
Within this context, rehearsal-based methods i.e., solutions in where the
learner exploits memory to revisit past data, has proven to be very effective,
leading to performance at the state-of-the-art. In our study, we propose an
analysis of the memory quantity/quality trade-off adopting various data
reduction approaches to increase the number of instances storable in memory. In
particular, we investigate complex instance compression techniques such as deep
encoders, but also trivial approaches such as image resizing and linear
dimensionality reduction. Our findings suggest that the optimal trade-off is
severely skewed toward instance quantity, where rehearsal approaches with
several heavily compressed instances easily outperform state-of-the-art
approaches with the same amount of memory at their disposal. Further, in high
memory configurations, deep approaches extracting spatial structure combined
with extreme resizing (of the order of $8\times8$ images) yield the best
results, while in memory-constrained configurations where deep approaches
cannot be used due to their memory requirement in training, Extreme Learning

this reason, a central aspect of human learning is the ability to recycle
previously acquired knowledge in a way that allows for faster, less
resource-intensive acquisition of new skills. In spite of that, how neural
networks in the brain leverage existing knowledge to learn new computations is
not well understood. In this work, we study this question in artificial
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on a corpus of commonly used
neuroscience tasks. Combining brain-inspired inductive biases we call
functional and structural, we propose a system that learns new tasks by
building on top of pre-trained latent dynamics organised into separate
recurrent modules. These modules, acting as prior knowledge acquired previously
through evolution or development, are pre-trained on the statistics of the full
corpus of tasks so as to be independent and maximally informative. The
resulting model, we call a Modular Latent Primitives (MoLaP) network, allows
for learning multiple tasks while keeping parameter counts, and updates, low.
We also show that the skills acquired with our approach are more robust to a
broad range of perturbations compared to those acquired with other multi-task
learning strategies, and that generalisation to new tasks is facilitated. This
work offers a new perspective on achieving efficient multi-task learning in the

However, representation learning techniques require a significant amount of
time for model training, with most of the time spent on precise hyper-parameter
optimization and selection of augmentation techniques. We hypothesized that if
the annotated dataset has enough morphological diversity to capture the
diversity of the general population, as is common in medical imaging due to
conserved similarities of tissue morphology, the variance error of the trained

proposed the Variance Aware Training (VAT) method that exploits this data

landmark-based output-feedback controllers obtained via Control Lyapunov
Functions, Control Barrier Functions, and robust Linear Programming. Our
solution inherits many benefits of RRT*-like algorithms, such as the ability to
implicitly handle arbitrarily complex obstacles, and asymptotic optimality.
Additionally, it extends planning beyond the discrete nominal paths, as
feedback controllers can correct deviations from such paths, and are robust to
discrepancies between the map used for planning and the real environment.
  We test our algorithms first in simulations and then in experiments, testing
the robustness of the approach to practical conditions, such as deformations of
the environment, mismatches in the dynamical model of the robot, and
measurements acquired with a camera with a limited field of view.

labeled training examples and unlabeled test examples as input, and provides

the statistical distance between the train and test distribution (or the
fraction of adversarial examples). For linear regression, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm based on Celis-Dennis-Tapia optimization algorithms.

some multitudes are not sets. Why some multitudes of objects of thought cannot
themselves be objects of thought? Moreover, it is a logical truth that such
multitudes do exist. However we do not understand this logical truth so well as
we understand, for example, the logical truth $\forall x \ x=x$. In this paper,
we formulate a logical truth which we call the productivity principle. Bertrand
Rusell was the first one to formulate this principle, but in a restricted form
and with a different purpose. The principle explicates a logical mechanism that
lies behind paradoxical multitudes and is understandable as well as any simple
logical truth. However, it does not explain the concept of set. It only sets
logical bounds of the concept within the framework of the classical two-valued
$\in$ - language. The principle behaves as a logical regulator of any theory we
formulate to explain and describe sets. It provides tools to identify
paradoxical classes inside the theory. We show how the known paradoxical
classes follow from the productivity principle and how the principle gives us a
uniform way to generate new paradoxical classes. In the case of $ZFC$ set
theory, the productivity principle shows that the limitation of size principles
are of a restrictive nature and that they do not explain which classes are
sets. The productivity principle, as a logical regulator, can have a definite
heuristic role in the development of a consistent set theory. We sketch such a
theory -- the cumulative cardinal theory of sets.

injecting fluid in weak, poorly consolidated rocks. The model is based on the
key assumption that the hydraulic fracture is propagating within a domain where
the hydraulic fields are quasi-stationary. By further assuming a negligible
toughness, the fracture is shown to grow as a square root of time. The
asymptotic fracture propagation regimes at small and large time are constructed
and the transient solution is computed by solving a nonlinear system of
algebraic equations formulated in terms of the fracture aperture. At early time
the fracture is hydraulically invisible and the injection pressure increases
with time $t$ as $\log t$, while at late time leak-off from the borehole is
negligible and the injection pressure decreases as $t^{-1/4}$. According to
this model, the peak injection pressure observed when injecting fluid in weak,
poorly consolidated rocks should not be interpreted as indicating a breakdown
of the formation, but rather as marking the transition between two asymptotic
flow regimes. The timescale that legislates the transition between the small

consistent description of a model even if there is local agreement. In
particular, quantum models present this property. We can describe contextuality
with the bundle approach, where the scenario is represented as a simplicial
complex, the fibers being the sets of outcomes, and contextuality as the
non-existence of global section in the measure bundle. Using the generalization
to non-finite outcome fibers, we built in details the concept of measure
bundle, demonstrating the Fine-Abramsky-Brandenburger theorem for the bundle
formalism. We introduce a hierarchy called n-contextuality to explore the
dependence of contextual behavior of a model to the topology of the scenario,
following the construction of it as a simplicial complex. With it we exemplify
the dependence on higher homology groups and show that GHZ models, thus quantum
theory, has all levels of the hierarchy. Also, we give an example of how
non-trivial topology of the scenario result an increase of contextual behavior.
For the first level of the hierarchy, we construct the concept of connection
through Markov operators for the measure bundle. Taking the case of equal
fibers we can identify the outcomes as the basis of a vector space, that
transform according to a group extracted from the connection. We thus show that
contextuality has a relationship with the non-triviality of the holonomy group
in the frame bundle.

common technique that aims to improve speech intelligibility by multiplying
reverberant speech by a matrix of gain values to suppress T-F bins dominated by
reverberation. Recently proposed mask estimation algorithms leverage machine
learning approaches to distinguish between target speech and reverberant
reflections. However, the spectro-temporal structure of speech is highly
variable and dependent on the underlying phoneme. One way to potentially
overcome this variability is to leverage explicit knowledge of phonemic
information during mask estimation. This study proposes a phoneme-based mask
estimation algorithm, where separate mask estimation models are trained for
each phoneme. Sentence recognition tests were conducted in normal hearing
listeners to determine whether a phoneme-based mask estimation algorithm is
beneficial in the ideal scenario where perfect knowledge of the phoneme is

where the source data are not available during target adaptation. Previous
works on SFDA mainly focus on aligning the cross-domain distributions. However,
they ignore the generalization ability of the pretrained source model, which
largely influences the initial target outputs that are vital to the target
adaptation stage. To address this, we make the interesting observation that the
model accuracy is highly correlated with whether or not attention is focused on
the objects in an image. To this end, we propose a generic and effective
framework based on Transformer, named TransDA, for learning a generalized model
for SFDA. Specifically, we apply the Transformer as the attention module and
inject it into a convolutional network. By doing so, the model is encouraged to
turn attention towards the object regions, which can effectively improve the
model's generalization ability on the target domains. Moreover, a novel
self-supervised knowledge distillation approach is proposed to adapt the
Transformer with target pseudo-labels, thus further encouraging the network to
focus on the object regions. Experiments on three domain adaptation tasks,
including closed-set, partial-set, and open-set adaption, demonstrate that
TransDA can greatly improve the adaptation accuracy and produce
state-of-the-art results. The source code and trained models are available at

rule that provides an associated estimate of the optimal decision. We aim at
finding the least conservative prediction and prescription rules, which satisfy
some specified asymptotic guarantees as the sample size tends to infinity. We
demonstrate that under some mild assumption the resulting vector optimization
problems admit a Pareto optimal solution with some attractive theoretical

Roman Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) will serve as a pathfinder for key
technologies needed for future Earth-finding missions. The Roman Exoplanet
Imaging Data Challenge (Roman EIDC) was a community engagement effort that
tasked participants with extracting exoplanets and their orbits for a 47
UMa-like target star, given: (1) 15 years of simulated precursor radial
velocity (RV) data, and (2) six epochs of simulated imaging taken over the
course of the Roman mission. The Roman EIDC simulated images include 4 epochs
with CGI's Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) plus 2 epochs with a starshade (SS)
assumed to arrive as part of a Starshade Rendezvous later in the mission. Here,
we focus on our in-house analysis of the outermost planet, for which the
starshade's higher throughput and lower noise floor present a factor of ~4
improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over the narrow-field HLC. We find that,
although the RV detection was marginal, the precursor RV data enable the mass
and orbit to be constrained with only 2 epochs of starshade imaging. Including
the HLC images in the analysis results in improved measurements over RV + SS
alone, with the greatest gains resulting from images taken at epochs near
maximum elongation. Combining the two epochs of SS imaging with the RV + HLC
data resulted in a factor of ~2 better orbit and mass determinations over RV +
HLC alone. The Roman CGI, combined with precursor RV data and later mission SS
imaging, form a powerful trifecta in detecting exoplanets and determining their
masses, albedos, and system configurations. While the Roman CGI will break new
scientific and technological ground with direct imaging of giant exoplanets
within ~5 AU of V~5 and brighter stars, a Roman Starshade Rendezvous mission
would additionally enable the detection of planets out to ~8 AU in those
systems.

class $j$ job consists of $d_j$ components, placed on a randomly selected
subset of servers; the job service is complete as soon as $k_j$ components out
of $d_j$ (with $k_j \le d_j$) complete their service, at which point the
unfinished service of all remaining $d_j-k_j$ components is canceled. The
system is in general non-work-conserving, in the sense that the average amount
of new workload added to the system by an arriving class $j$ job is not defined
a priori -- it depends on the system state at the time of arrival. This poses
the main challenge for the system analysis.
  For the system with a fixed number of servers $n$ our main results include:
the stability properties; the property that the stationary distributions of the
relative server workloads remain tight, uniformly in the system load.
  We also consider the mean-field asymptotic regime when $n\to\infty$ while
each job class arrival rate per server remains constant. The main question we
address here is: under which conditions the steady-state asymptotic
independence (SSAI) of server workloads holds, and in particular when the SSAI
for the full range of loads (SSAI-FRL) holds. (Informally, SSAI-FRL means that
SSAI holds for any system load less than $1$.) We obtain sufficient conditions
for SSAI and SSAI-FRL. In particular, we prove that SSAI-FRL holds in the
important special case when job components of each class $j$ are i.i.d. with an

One of the major problems is that these observational data suffer from
survivorship bias. Examples include analyzing traffic logs from networks, and
simulation logs from circuit design. In such applications, users want to detect
non-spurious correlations from observational data and obtain actionable
insights about them. In this paper, we introduce log to Neuro-symbolic
(Log2NS), a framework that combines probabilistic analysis from machine
learning (ML) techniques on observational data with certainties derived from
symbolic reasoning on an underlying formal model. We apply the proposed
framework to network traffic debugging by employing the following steps. To
detect patterns in network logs, we first generate global embedding vector
representations of entities such as IP addresses, ports, and applications.
Next, we represent large log flow entries as clusters that make it easier for
the user to visualize and detect interesting scenarios that will be further
analyzed. To generalize these patterns, Log2NS provides an ability to query
from static logs and correlation engines for positive instances, as well as
formal reasoning for negative and unseen instances. By combining the strengths
of deep learning and symbolic methods, Log2NS provides a very powerful
reasoning and debugging tool for log-based data. Empirical evaluations on a
real internal data set demonstrate the capabilities of Log2NS.

wide range of applications, spanning graph-based path-finding to machine

implementing SpGEMM kernels has been the pressure placed on DRAM memory. One
approach to tackle this problem is to use an inner product method for the
SpGEMM kernel implementation. While the inner product produces fewer
intermediate results, it can end up saturating the memory bandwidth, given the
high number of redundant fetches of the input matrix elements. Using an outer
product-based SpGEMM kernel can reduce redundant fetches, but at the cost of
increased overhead due to extra computation and memory accesses for
producing/managing partial products.
  In this thesis, we introduce a novel SpGEMM kernel implementation based on
the row-wise product approach. We leverage atomic instructions to merge
intermediate partial products as they are generated. The use of atomic
instructions eliminates the need to create partial product matrices.
  To evaluate our row-wise product approach, we map an optimized SpGEMM kernel
to a custom accelerator designed to accelerate graph-based applications. The
targeted accelerator is an experimental system named PIUMA, being developed by
Intel. PIUMA provides several attractive features, including fast context
switching, user-configurable caches, globally addressable memory, non-coherent
caches, and asynchronous pipelines. We tailor our SpGEMM kernel to exploit many
of the features of the PIUMA fabric.
  This thesis compares our SpGEMM implementation against prior solutions, all
mapped to the PIUMA framework. We briefly describe some of the PIUMA
architecture features and then delve into the details of our optimized SpGEMM
kernel. Our SpGEMM kernel can achieve 9.4x speedup as compared to competing

with an action label. However, it is quite expensive to annotate every frame in
a large corpus of videos to construct a comprehensive supervised training
dataset. Thus in this work we propose an unsupervised method, namely SSCAP,
that operates on a corpus of unlabeled videos and predicts a likely set of
temporal segments across the videos. SSCAP leverages Self-Supervised learning
to extract distinguishable features and then applies a novel Co-occurrence
Action Parsing algorithm to not only capture the correlation among sub-actions
underlying the structure of activities, but also estimate the temporal path of
the sub-actions in an accurate and general way. We evaluate on both classic
datasets (Breakfast, 50Salads) and the emerging fine-grained action dataset
(FineGym) with more complex activity structures and similar sub-actions.
Results show that SSCAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets
and can even outperform some weakly-supervised approaches, demonstrating its
effectiveness and generalizability.

potential to augment compliance monitoring by detecting early warning signs of
noncompliance. We demonstrate a process for rapid identification of significant
structural expansion using Planet's 3m/pixel satellite imagery products and
focusing on Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) in the US as a test
case. Unpermitted building expansion has been a particular challenge with
CAFOs, which pose significant health and environmental risks. Using new
hand-labeled dataset of 145,053 images of 1,513 CAFOs, we combine
state-of-the-art building segmentation with a likelihood-based change-point
detection model to provide a robust signal of building expansion (AUC = 0.86).
A major advantage of this approach is that it can work with higher cadence
(daily to weekly), but lower resolution (3m/pixel), satellite imagery than
previously used in similar environmental settings. It is also highly
generalizable and thus provides a near real-time monitoring tool to prioritize
enforcement resources in other settings where unpermitted construction poses
environmental risk, e.g. zoning, habitat modification, or wetland protection.

proposed estimates both voltage magnitude and angle for each phase at the

seamlessly manages the data available from the optimization procedure through

explainability of image classifier predictions. However, these post-hoc
explanations may not always be faithful to classifier predictions, which poses
a significant challenge when attempting to debug models based on such
explanations. To this end, we seek a methodology that can improve the
faithfulness of an explanation method with respect to model predictions which
does not require ground truth explanations. We achieve this through a novel
explanation-driven data augmentation (EDDA) technique that augments the
training data with occlusions inferred from model explanations; this is based
on the simple motivating principle that \emph{if} the explainer is faithful to
the model \emph{then} occluding salient regions for the model prediction should
decrease the model confidence in the prediction, while occluding non-salient
regions should not change the prediction. To verify that the proposed
augmentation method has the potential to improve faithfulness, we evaluate EDDA
using a variety of datasets and classification models. We demonstrate
empirically that our approach leads to a significant increase of faithfulness,
which can facilitate better debugging and successful deployment of image
classification models in real-world applications.

the guessing curve depends on the attacker's guessing strategy and the
distribution of user passwords both of which are unknown to us. In this work we
aim to follow Kerckhoffs' principle and analyze the performance of an optimal
attacker who knows the password distribution. Let $\lambda_G$ denote the
probability that such an attacker can crack a random user's password within $G$
guesses. We develop several statistically rigorous techniques to upper and
lower bound $\lambda_G$ given $N$ independent samples from the unknown
distribution. We show that our bounds hold with high confidence and apply our
techniques to analyze eight password datasets. Our empirical analysis shows
that even state-of-the-art password cracking models are often significantly
less guess efficient than an attacker who can optimize its attack based on its
(partial) knowledge of the password distribution. We also apply our techniques
to re-examine the empirical password distribution and Zipf's Law. We find that
the empirical distribution closely matches our bounds on $\lambda_G$ when $G$
is not too large i.e., $G \ll N$. However, for larger values of $G$ our
empirical analysis rigorously demonstrates that the empirical distribution
(resp. Zipf's Law) overestimates the attacker's success rate. We apply our
techniques to upper/lower bound the effectiveness of password throttling
mechanisms (key-stretching) which are used to reduce the number of attacker
guesses $G$. Finally, if we make an additional assumption about the way users

Transformers, an alternative to the traditionally convolution-reliant computer
vision systems. However, the Transformer models do not explicitly model the

object classification tasks using a Vision Transformer architecture. Using
square pooling regions or biologically-inspired radial-polar pooling regions,
our proposed model pools the image features from the convolution backbone and
uses the pooled features as an input to transformer layers. It decides on
subsequent fixation location based on the attention assigned by the Transformer
to various locations from past and present fixations. It dynamically allocates
more fixation/computational resources to more challenging images before making
the final image category decision. Using five ablation studies, we evaluate the
contribution of different components of the Foveated model. We perform a

adversarial attacks with both types of pooling regions, where we see the
Foveated model outperform the Baseline model.

norm of the polynomial on the field of values of $A$ divided by the 2-norm of

of the Crouzeix ratio is 0.5, regardless of the matrix order and polynomial
degree, and it is known that 1 is a frequently occurring locally minimal value.
Making use of a heavy-tailed distribution to initialize our optimization
computations, we demonstrate for the first time that the Crouzeix ratio has
many other locally minimal values between 0.5 and 1. Besides showing that the
same function values are repeatedly obtained for many different starting
points, we also verify that an approximate nonsmooth stationarity condition
holds at computed candidate local minimizers. We also find that the same
locally minimal values are often obtained both when optimizing over real
matrices and polynomials, and over complex matrices and polynomials. We argue
that minimization of the Crouzeix ratio makes a very interesting nonsmooth
optimization case study, illustrating among other things how effective the BFGS
method is for nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization. Our method for verifying
approximate nonsmooth stationarity is based on what may be a novel approach to
finding approximate subgradients of max functions on an interval. Our extensive

underpins many information retrieval tasks. Successful TLS requires identifying
an appropriate set of key dates (the timeline length) to cover. However, doing
so is challenging as the right length can change from one topic to another.
Existing TLS solutions either rely on an event-agnostic fixed length or an
expert-supplied setting. Neither of the strategies is desired for real-life TLS
scenarios. A fixed, event-agnostic setting ignores the diversity of events and
their development and hence can lead to low-quality TLS. Relying on
expert-crafted settings is neither scalable nor sustainable for processing many
dynamically changing events. This paper presents a better TLS approach for
automatically and dynamically determining the TLS timeline length. We achieve
this by employing the established elbow method from the machine learning
community to automatically find the minimum number of dates within the time
series to generate concise and informative summaries. We applied our approach
to four TLS datasets of English and Chinese and compared them against three

label-free measurement has long been pursued due to the limitations of
manufacturing techniques. In this paper, a compact all-fibre label-free
nano-sensor composed of a fibre taper and zinc oxide nano-gratings is designed
and applied for the early monitoring of apoptosis in single living cells.
Because of its nanoscale dimensions, mechanical flexibility and minimal
cytotoxicity to cells, the sensing module can be loaded in cells for long-term
in situ tracking with high sensitivity. A gradual increase in the nuclear
refractive index during the apoptosis process is observed, revealing the
increase in molecular density and the decrease in cell volume. The strategy
used in this study not only contributes to the understanding of internal
environmental variations during cellular apoptosis but also provides a new
platform for non-fluorescent all-fibre devices to investigate cellular events
and to promote new progress in fundamental cell biochemical engineering.

inference compared to sequence-to-sequence models; however, inference in
sequence labeling GEC models is an iterative process, as sentences are passed
to the model for multiple rounds of correction, which exposes the model to
sentences with progressively fewer errors at each round. Traditional GEC models
learn from sentences with fixed error rates. Coupling this with the iterative
correction process causes a mismatch between training and inference that
affects final performance. In order to address this mismatch, we propose a
GAN-like sequence labeling model, which consists of a grammatical error
detector as a discriminator and a grammatical error labeler with Gumbel-Softmax
sampling as a generator. By sampling from real error distributions, our errors
are more genuine compared to traditional synthesized GEC errors, thus
alleviating the aforementioned mismatch and allowing for better training. Our
results on several evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed approach

expressed towards different aspects in a sentence. While state-of-the-art ASC

from the issue of robustness. Particularly in two common scenarios: when
domains of test and training data are different (out-of-domain scenario) or
test data is adversarially perturbed (adversarial scenario), ASC models may
attend to irrelevant words and neglect opinion expressions that truly describe
diverse aspects. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, we hypothesize that
position bias (i.e., the words closer to a concerning aspect would carry a
higher degree of importance) is crucial for building more robust ASC models by
reducing the probability of mis-attending. Accordingly, we propose two
mechanisms for capturing position bias, namely position-biased weight and
position-biased dropout, which can be flexibly injected into existing models to
enhance representations for classification. Experiments conducted on
out-of-domain and adversarial datasets demonstrate that our proposed approaches
largely improve the robustness and effectiveness of current models.

M6-UFC, both the diverse control signals and the synthesized image are
uniformly represented as a sequence of discrete tokens to be processed by

support preserving specified image blocks, and to improve the synthesis speed.
Further, we design a progressive algorithm that iteratively improves the

converges to the equilibrium position during muscle relaxation. This paper
proposes a novel biomimetic control method for myoelectric prosthetic hands
integrating the impedance model with the concept of the $\lambda$-type muscle

position, according to the state of the muscle, and can maintain the joint
angle naturally during muscle relaxation. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is evaluated through simulations and a series of experiments on

Additionally, the control experiments showed that the proposed method could

of study. Existing methods rely on theoretical assumptions that the observation
times have equal or i.i.d. spacings, and that common estimators, such as the
periodogram peak, are consistent and asymptotically normal. In practice,
however, these assumptions are unrealistic as observation times usually exhibit
deterministic patterns -- e.g., the nightly observation cycle in astronomy --
that imprint nuisance periodicities in the data. These nuisance signals also
affect the finite-sample distribution of estimators, which can substantially
deviate from normality. Here, we propose a set identification method, fusing
ideas from randomization inference and partial identification. In particular,
we develop a sharp test for any periodicity value, and then invert the test to
build a confidence set. This approach is appropriate here because the
construction of confidence sets does not rely on assumptions of regular or
well-behaved asymptotics. Notably, our inference is valid in finite samples
when our method is fully implemented, while it can be asymptotically valid
under an approximate implementation designed to ease computation. Empirically,
we validate our method in exoplanet detection using radial velocity data. In
this context, our method correctly identifies the periodicity of the confirmed
exoplanets in our sample. For some other, yet unconfirmed detections, we show
that the statistical evidence is weak, which illustrates the failure of
traditional statistical techniques. Last but not least, our method offers a
constructive way to resolve these identification issues via improved
observation designs. In exoplanet detection, these designs suggest meaningful
improvements in identifying periodicity even when a moderate amount of
randomization is introduced in scheduling radial velocity measurements.

editing of real faces remains challenging. The gap between the $W$ space and

space by replacing fully-connected layers in the StyleGAN's mapping network
with attention-based transformers. This simple and effective technique
integrates the aforementioned two spaces and transforms them into one new
latent space called $W$++. Our modified StyleGAN maintains the state-of-the-art
generation quality of the original StyleGAN with moderately better diversity.
But more importantly, the proposed $W$++ space achieves superior performance in
both reconstruction quality and editing quality. Despite these significant
advantages, our $W$++ space supports existing inversion algorithms and editing
methods with only negligible modifications thanks to its structural similarity
with the $W/W$+ space. Extensive experiments on the FFHQ dataset prove that our
proposed $W$++ space is evidently more preferable than the previous $W/W$+

ideal value of the specification and the system's actual implementation, which
are consequences of strategic decisions for immediate gains, or unintended

keep it managed. Identification and measurement are the first two stages of the
management process; however, they are little explored in academic research in
requirements engineering. Objective: We aimed at investigating which evidence
helps to strengthen the process of TD requirements management, including
identification and measurement. Method: We conducted a Systematic Literature
Review through manual and automatic searches considering 7499 studies from 2010
to 2020, and including 61 primary studies. Results: We identified some causes
related to Technical Debt requirements, existing strategies to help in the
identification and measurement, and metrics to support the measurement stage.
Conclusion: Studies on TD requirements are still preliminary, especially on

which are difficulties encountered when performing such activities, and
therefore also require research. Finally, the provision of metrics to help
measure TD is part of this work's contribution, providing insights into the

Compton Camera (EBIT-CC), a new Compton polarimeter with pixelated multi-layer

three-dimensional position of Compton scattering and photoelectric absorption,
and thus the degree of polarization of incoming x-rays can be evaluated. We

its polarimetric capability through an observation of radiative recombination
x-rays emitted from highly charged krypton ions, which were generated by the

them to every registered event. As a result, we successfully obtained the

RAM has low surface reflectance ($\lesssim 1\%$) in a wide frequency range

RAM that satisfies this requirement based on a production technology using a
3D-printed mold (named as RAM-3pm). This method allows us to shape periodic
surface structures to achieve a low reflectance. A wide range of choices for
the absorptive materials is an advantage. We survey the best material for the
RAM-3pm. We measure the index of refraction ($n$) and the extinction
coefficient ($\kappa$) at liquid nitrogen temperature as well as at room
temperature of 17 materials. We also measure the reflectance at the room
temperature for the selected materials. The mixture of an epoxy adhesive

estimate the optical performance at the liquid nitrogen temperature by a
simulation based on the measured $n$ and $\kappa$. The RAM-3pm made with this

baths, and investigate the effects of anisotropy and quasi-breaking of
periodicity on resonant emission into the band of the bath. We asymptotically
decompose the Green's function into long-range travelling waves composed of all
wavevectors (near-)resonant at the emitter frequency, and rapidly decaying
evanescent waves. Our approximation then converges exponentially with
increasing source-receiver separation ${\rho}$ when resonant wavepackets with
group velocity parallel to ${\rho}$ exist. In hyperbolic media this condition
may not be satisfied, and we find that the exponential decay length of
oscillating evanescent waves locally around caustics generally depends as a
power law with exponent 3/2 on the angle made between ${\rho}$ and the caustic.
For ${\rho}$ beyond the caustic we observe that the Green's function can become
almost imaginary, which results in exclusively incoherent emitter-emitter
interactions and allows the simulation of purely dissipative systems with
short-range interactions. Here the interaction length is tunable via the
separation vector of the emitters. We finally probe the hyperbolic dispersion
beyond the previous regimes by applying an artificial gauge field on the
lattice. We find that emission resonant with the corresponding open orbits in
the Brillouin zone is quasi-one dimensional, in contrast to an isotropic
environment. The quasi-1D emission is further topologically protected against
local and global lattice perturbations and periodically refocussing, offering a
robust bi-directional transport of excitations in higher-dimensional media.

to solve. Most advanced state-of-the-art online solvers leverage ideas of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). These solvers rapidly converge to the most promising
branches of the belief tree, avoiding the suboptimal sections. Most of these
algorithms are designed to utilize straightforward access to the state reward
and assume the belief-dependent reward is nothing but expectation over the
state reward. Thus, they are inapplicable to a more general and essential
setting of belief-dependent rewards. One example of such reward is differential
entropy approximated using a set of weighted particles of the belief. Such an
information-theoretic reward introduces a significant computational burden. In
this paper, we embed the paradigm of simplification into the MCTS algorithm. In
particular, we present Simplified Information-Theoretic Particle Filter Tree
(SITH-PFT), a novel variant to the MCTS algorithm that considers
information-theoretic rewards but avoids the need to calculate them completely.
We replace the costly calculation of information-theoretic rewards with
adaptive upper and lower bounds. These bounds are easy to calculate and
tightened only by the demand of our algorithm. Crucially, we guarantee
precisely the same belief tree and solution that would be obtained by MCTS,
which explicitly calculates the original information-theoretic rewards. Our
approach is general; namely, any converging to the reward bounds can be easily
plugged-in to achieve substantial speedup without any loss in performance.

robustness against adversarial examples. However, previous works mainly focus
on the overall robustness of the model, and the in-depth analysis on the role
of each class involved in adversarial training is still missing. In this paper,
we propose to analyze the class-wise robustness in adversarial training. First,
we provide a detailed diagnosis of adversarial training on six benchmark
datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet.
Surprisingly, we find that there are remarkable robustness discrepancies among
classes, leading to unbalance/unfair class-wise robustness in the robust
models. Furthermore, we keep investigating the relations between classes and
find that the unbalanced class-wise robustness is pretty consistent among
different attack and defense methods. Moreover, we observe that the stronger
attack methods in adversarial learning achieve performance improvement mainly
from a more successful attack on the vulnerable classes (i.e., classes with
less robustness). Inspired by these interesting findings, we design a simple
but effective attack method based on the traditional PGD attack, named
Temperature-PGD attack, which proposes to enlarge the robustness disparity
among classes with a temperature factor on the confidence distribution of each
image. Experiments demonstrate our method can achieve a higher attack rate than
the PGD attack. Furthermore, from the defense perspective, we also make some
modifications in the training and inference phase to improve the robustness of
the most vulnerable class, so as to mitigate the large difference in class-wise
robustness. We believe our work can contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of adversarial training as well as rethinking the class-wise

games represented by logical constraints. These games are a useful formalism to
model a wide array of problems arising, e.g., in program synthesis. Our
technique for solving these games is based on the notion of subgoals, which are
slices of the game that the reachability player necessarily needs to pass
through in order to reach the goal. We use Craig interpolation to identify
these necessary sets of moves and recursively slice the game along these
subgoals. Our approach allows us to infer winning strategies that are
structured along the subgoals. If the game is won by the reachability player,
this is a strategy that progresses through the subgoals towards the final goal;
if the game is won by the safety player, it is a permissive strategy that
completely avoids a single subgoal. We evaluate our prototype implementation on
a range of different games. On multiple benchmark families, our prototype
scales dramatically better than previously available tools.

this paper, a novel compressed sensing method for PACT using an untrained

reconstruct without the requirement for any additional learning based on the

outperforms 32.72% (SSIM) with the traditional compressed sensing method in the

essential aspect in modeling the dynamics of an infectious disease.
Additionally, any realistic data-driven model must take into account the large
uncertainty in the values reported by official sources, such as the amount of
infectious individuals. In this paper we address the above aspects through a
hyperbolic compartmental model on networks, in which nodes identify locations
of interest, such as cities or regions, and arcs represent the ensemble of main
mobility paths. The model describes the spatial movement and interactions of a
population partitioned, from an epidemiological point of view, on the basis of
an extended compartmental structure and divided into commuters, moving on a
suburban scale, and non-commuters, acting on an urban scale. Through a
diffusive rescaling, the model allows us to recover classical diffusion
equations related to commuting dynamics. The numerical solution of the
resulting multiscale hyperbolic system with uncertainty is then tackled using a
stochastic collocation approach in combination with a finite-volume IMEX
method. The ability of the model to correctly describe the spatial
heterogeneity underlying the spread of an epidemic in a realistic city network
is confirmed with a study of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy and its spread
in the Lombardy Region.

existing defense works require high computational overhead or backdoor attack
information such as the trigger size, which is difficult to satisfy in
realistic scenarios. In this paper, a novel backdoor detection method based on
adversarial examples is proposed. The proposed method leverages intentional
adversarial perturbations to detect whether an image contains a trigger, which
can be applied in both the training stage and the inference stage (sanitize the
training set in training stage and detect the backdoor instances in inference
stage). Specifically, given an untrusted image, the adversarial perturbation is
added to the image intentionally. If the prediction of the model on the
perturbed image is consistent with that on the unperturbed image, the input
image will be considered as a backdoor instance. Compared with most existing
defense works, the proposed adversarial perturbation based method requires low
computational resources and maintains the visual quality of the images.
Experimental results show that, the backdoor detection rate of the proposed
defense method is 99.63%, 99.76% and 99.91% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and
GTSRB datasets, respectively. Besides, the proposed method maintains the visual
quality of the image as the l2 norm of the added perturbation are as low as
2.8715, 3.0513 and 2.4362 on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets,

achieve high defense performance against backdoor attacks under different
attack settings (trigger transparency, trigger size and trigger pattern).
Compared with the existing defense work (STRIP), the proposed method has better
detection performance on all the three datasets, and is more efficient than
STRIP.

derived. For the converse inclusion the new logical connectives are used to
introduce a concurrent version $\S_{2}$ of $S$ and $\bG \subseteq \bS_{2}$ is

Archimedean property of the real numbers as an induction principle. We
introduce a concurrent version of this principle which allows us to prove that
$\bS^{*}$ and $\bG^{*}$ coincide. A further central contribution is the
extension of the above results to the hyperspace of non-empty compact subsets

the electrons to have transverse momentum more than 20 GeV in the forward
electron pseudorapidity region $2.0 \leq \eta_{e} \leq 4.25$. The NNLO
predictions are first compared at 8 TeV with the measurement of the LHCb
experiment at the LHC for the W$^{+}$/W$^{-}$ cross section ratio and charge
asymmetry distributions. The 8 TeV predictions using NNPDF3.1, CT14, and
MMHT2014 PDF sets are reported to be in good agreement with the LHCb data for
the entire $\eta_{e}$ region justifying the extension of the calculations to 13
TeV and 14 TeV energies. The charge asymmetry predictions at NNLO accuracy are
also reported in the forward $\eta_{e}$ bins at 13 TeV and 14 TeV and compared
among NNPDF3.1, CT14, and MMHT2014 PDF sets. Overall the predicted W$^{\pm}$
differential cross section and charge asymmetry distributions based on
different PDF sets are found to be consistent with each other for the entire
$\eta_{e}$ region. The charge asymmetry distributions are shown to be more
sensitive to discriminate among different PDF models in the 14 TeV predictions.

velocity decreases rapidly with radius. We provide an explanation of this layer
based on the thermal wind balance equation. Since convective motions are not
affected by solar rotation in the top layer of the convection zone, we argue
that the temperature falls at the same rate at all latitudes in this layer.
This makes the thermal wind term very large in this layer and the centrifugal
term has also to become very large to balance it, giving rise to the NSSL. From
the values of differential rotation $\Omega (r<r_c, \theta)$ at radii less than
a radius $r_c$, we can calculate the temperature difference $\Delta T (r,
\theta)$ with respect to the standard solar model at different points of the
convection zone, by making use of the thermal wind balance equation. Then we
again use this equation in the top layer to calculate $\Omega (r>r_c, \theta)$
there from $\Delta T (r, \theta)$. We carry on this exercise using both an
analytical expression of the differential rotation and the actual data provided
by helioseismology. We find that our theoretical results of the NSSL match the
observational data reasonably well for $r_c \approx 0.96~{\rm R_{\odot}}$,
giving an estimate of the radius till which the convective motions are affected
by the solar rotation.

  Programming Language: UnDiFi-2D is written in standard Fortran 77/95; its
design is highly modular in order to enhance simplicity of use, maintenance and
allow coupling with virtually any existing CFD solver;
  Usability, Maintenance and Enhancement: In order to improve the usability,
maintenance and enhancement of the code also the documentation has been
carefully taken into account. The git distributed versioning system has been
adopted to facilitate collaborative maintenance and code development;

more than a decade of still ongoing CFD developments. This work is focused on
the computational techniques adopted and a detailed description of the main

approach to estimate predictive uncertainty in Deep Learning, and can be
interpreted as an approximation of the posterior distribution via a mixture of
delta functions. The training of ensembles relies on non-convexity of the loss
landscape and random initialization of their individual members, making the
resulting posterior approximation uncontrolled. This paper proposes a novel and
principled method to tackle this limitation, minimizing an $f$-divergence
between the true posterior and a kernel density estimator (KDE) in a function
space. We analyze this objective from a combinatorial point of view, and show
that it is submodular with respect to mixture components for any $f$.
Subsequently, we consider the problem of greedy ensemble construction. From the
marginal gain on the negative $f$-divergence, which quantifies an improvement
in posterior approximation yielded by adding a new component into the KDE, we
derive a novel diversity term for ensemble methods. The performance of our
approach is demonstrated on computer vision out-of-distribution detection

similarity computation between the compact node representation by embedding

intensive similarity computation in link prediction, the hashing technique has
been successfully used to produce the node representation in the Hamming space.
However, the hashing-based link prediction algorithms face accuracy loss from
the randomized hashing techniques or inefficiency from the learning to hash
techniques in the embedding process. Currently, the Graph Neural Network (GNN)
framework has been widely applied to the graph-related tasks in an end-to-end

costs due to massive parameter learning, which makes the GNN-based algorithms
impractical without the help of a powerful workhorse. In this paper, we propose
a simple and effective model called #GNN, which balances the trade-off between
accuracy and efficiency. #GNN is able to efficiently acquire node
representation in the Hamming space for link prediction by exploiting the
randomized hashing technique to implement message passing and capture
high-order proximity in the GNN framework. Furthermore, we characterize the
discriminative power of #GNN in probability. The extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed #GNN algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to

running significantly faster than the learning-based algorithms. Also, the

show that coherent states give us a K\""{a}hler embedding of the orbit into
projective Hilbert space. In contrast, squeezed states, (which like coherent
states, also saturate the uncertainty bound) only give us a symplectic
embedding. We also study geometric quantisation of the co-adjoint orbits of the
group $\mathrm{SUT(2,\mathbb{R})}$ of real, special, upper triangular matrices
in two dimensions. We glean some general insights from these examples. Our
presentation is semi-expository and accessible to physicists.

traffic of potential vectors. Such information is often taken from vector
traffic models fitted to survey data. Here, user-specific data collected via
mobile apps offer new opportunities to obtain more accurate estimates and to
analyze how vectors' individual preferences affect propagule flows. However,
data voluntarily reported via apps may lack some trip records, adding a
significant layer of uncertainty. We show how the benefits of app-based data
can be exploited despite this drawback.
  Based on data collected via an angler app, we built a stochastic model for
angler traffic in the Canadian province Alberta. There, anglers facilitate the
spread of whirling disease, a parasite-induced fish disease. The model is
temporally and spatially explicit and accounts for individual preferences and
repeating behaviour of anglers, helping to address the problem of missing trip
records.
  We obtained estimates of angler traffic between all subbasins in Alberta. The
model's accuracy exceeds that of direct empirical estimates even when fewer
data were used to fit the model. The results indicate that anglers' local
preferences and their tendency to revisit previous destinations reduce the
number of long inter-waterbody trips potentially dispersing whirling disease.
According to our model, anglers revisit their previous destination in 64% of
their trips, making these trips irrelevant for the spread of whirling disease.
Furthermore, 54% of fishing trips end in individual-specific spatially
contained areas with mean radius of 54.7km. Finally, although the fraction of
trips that anglers report was unknown, we were able to estimate the total
yearly number of fishing trips in Alberta, matching an independent empirical
estimate.

$\delta_{CP}$ is in the ranges $[0^\circ,50^\circ]$, $[170^\circ,175^\circ]$

photon density is very important to understand the history of cosmological
structure formation of galaxies and stars since the epoch of recombination. The
EBL photons with the characteristic spectral energy distribution ranging from
ultraviolet/optical to far-infrared provide a major source of opacity of the
Universe to the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-rays travelling over cosmological distances.
The effect of the EBL is very significant through $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow
e^- e^+$ absorption process on the propagation of the $\gamma$-ray photons with
energy $E >$ 50 GeV emitted from the sources at $z \sim 1$. This effect is
characterized by the optical depth ($\tau$) which strongly depends on $E$, $z$
and density of the EBL photons. The proper density of the EBL photons increases
with $z$ due to expansion of the Universe whereas evolution of radiation
sources contributing to the EBL leads to a decrease in the density with
increasing $z$. Therefore, the resultant volumetric evolution of the EBL photon
density is approximated by a modified redshift dependence. In this work, we
probe evolution of the EBL photon density predicted by two prominent models
using cosmic gamma-ray horizon ($\tau (E,z)=$ 1) determined by the measurements
from the \emph{Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations. The modified
redshift dependence of the EBL photon density is optimized for a given EBL
model by estimating the same gamma-ray horizon as predicted by the
\emph{Fermi}-LAT observations. We further compare the optical depth estimates
in the energy range $E =$ 4 GeV-1 TeV and redshift range $z =0.01-1$ from the
\emph{Fermi}-LAT observations with the values derived from the two EBL models

working on improving the security of embedded devices. However, previous work
ignores the insecurity caused by a special category of devices, i.e., the
End-of-Life (EoL in short) devices. Once a product becomes End-of-Life, vendors
tend to no longer maintain its firmware or software, including providing bug
fixes and security patches. This makes EoL devices susceptible to attacks. For
instance, a report showed that an EoL model with thousands of active devices
was exploited to redirect web traffic for malicious purposes. In this paper, we
conduct the first measurement study to shed light on the (in)security of EoL
devices. To this end, our study performs two types of analysis, including the
aliveness analysis and the vulnerability analysis. The first one aims to detect
the scale of EoL devices that are still alive. The second one is to evaluate
the vulnerabilities existing in (active) EoL devices. We have applied our
approach to a large number of EoL models from three vendors (i.e., D-Link,
Tp-Link, and Netgear) and detect the alive devices in a time period of ten
months. Our study reveals some worrisome facts that were unknown by the
community. For instance, there exist more than 2 million active EoL devices.
Nearly 300,000 of them are still alive even after five years since they became
EoL. Although vendors may release security patches after the EoL date, however,
the process is ad hoc and incomplete. As a result, more than 1 million active
EoL devices are vulnerable, and nearly half of them are threatened by high-risk
vulnerabilities. Attackers can achieve a minimum of 2.79 Tbps DDoS attack by
compromising a large number of active EoL devices. We believe these facts pose
a clear call for more attention to deal with the security issues of EoL
devices.

re-balance the proportion of each answer's loss value in the total VQA loss.
The LPF firstly calculates a modulating factor to determine the language bias
using a question-only branch. Then, the LPF assigns a self-adaptive weight to
each training sample in the training process. With this reweighting mechanism,
the LPF ensures that the total VQA loss can be reshaped to a more balanced
form. By this means, the samples that require certain visual information to

  Training",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The training dynamics and generalization properties of neural networks (NN)
can be precisely characterized in function space via the neural tangent kernel
(NTK). Structural changes to the NTK during training reflect feature learning
and underlie the superior performance of networks outside of the static kernel
regime. In this work, we seek to theoretically understand kernel alignment, a
prominent and ubiquitous structural change that aligns the NTK with the target
function. We first study a toy model of kernel evolution in which the NTK
evolves to accelerate training and show that alignment naturally emerges from
this demand. We then study alignment mechanism in deep linear networks and two
layer ReLU networks. These theories provide good qualitative descriptions of
kernel alignment and specialization in practical networks and identify factors
in network architecture and data structure that drive kernel alignment. In
nonlinear networks with multiple outputs, we identify the phenomenon of kernel
specialization, where the kernel function for each output head preferentially
aligns to its own target function. Together, our results provide a mechanistic
explanation of how kernel alignment emerges during NN training and a normative
explanation of how it benefits training.

carefully tackled in the present study. Based on HRG, the particle ratios of
mainly strange and multi-strange particles are studied at energies from lower
$\sqrt{s}\sim $ 0.001 up to 13 TeV. The strangeness enhancement clearly
appeared at more higher energies, and the ratios are confronted to the
available experimental data. The particle ratios are also studied using the
Cosmic Ray Monte Carlo (CRMC) interface model with its two different event
generators namely; EPOS $1.99$ and EPOSlhc which show a good agreement with the
model calculations at the whole range of the energy. We utilize to produce some
ratios. EPOS $1.99$ is used to estimate particle ratios at lower energies from
AGS up to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) while EPOSlhc is used at
LHC energies. The production of kaons and lambda particles is studied in terms
of the mean multiplicity in p-p collisions at energies ranging from 4 - 26 GeV.
We find that both HRG model and the used event generators, EPOS $1.99$ and
EPOSlhc, can describe the particle ratios very well. Additionally, the
freeze-out parameters are estimated for different collision systems, such as
p-p and Pb-Pb, at LHC energies using both models.

general result is a perturbation bound of the signal space in terms of the
minimum singular value of Fourier matrices. When the point sources are located
in several separated clumps, we provide an explicit upper bound of the
noise-space correlation perturbation error in MUSIC and the support error in
ESPRIT in terms of a Super-Resolution Factor (SRF). The upper bound for ESPRIT
is then compared with a new Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for the clumps model. As a
result, we show that ESPRIT is comparable to that of the optimal unbiased
estimator(s) in terms of the dependence on noise, number of snapshots and SRF.
As a byproduct of our analysis, we discover several fundamental differences
between the single-snapshot and multi-snapshot problems. Our theory is

read-once formulas are known to allow exact PTIME solutions and non-read-once

max-flow problem that is guaranteed to give the exact solution for several
queries (and otherwise approximate minimizations). We show that our encoding is
guaranteed to return a read-once factorization if it exists. Our problem and

GeV with the BESIII detector, the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay $D^+\to

the decays containing narrow intermediate resonances, $D^+\to K^+\eta$, $D^+\to
K^+\omega$, and $D^+\to K^+\phi$, the branching fraction for the decay $D^+\to
K^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ is determined to be $(1.03 \pm 0.12_{\rm stat} \pm
0.06_{\rm syst})\times 10^{-3}$. The ratio of the branching fraction for
$D^+\to K^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ to its Cabibbo-favored counterpart $D^+\to
K^-\pi^+\pi^+\pi^0$ is measured to be $ (1.65\pm0.21)\%$, corresponding to
$(5.73\pm0.73)\tan^4\theta_C$, where $\theta_C$ is the Cabibbo mixing angle.
These results are consistent with our previous measurement with hadronic tags
but are significantly larger than other doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decays in the

  Programming","To be published in Proc. of CAV 2021",,,,"cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  A barrier certificate often serves as an inductive invariant that isolates an
unsafe region from the reachable set of states, and hence is widely used in
proving safety of hybrid systems possibly over the infinite time horizon. We
present a novel condition on barrier certificates, termed the invariant
barrier-certificate condition, that witnesses unbounded-time safety of
differential dynamical systems. The proposed condition is by far the least
conservative one on barrier certificates, and can be shown as the weakest
possible one to attain inductive invariance. We show that discharging the
invariant barrier-certificate condition -- thereby synthesizing invariant
barrier certificates -- can be encoded as solving an optimization problem
subject to bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). We further propose a synthesis
algorithm based on difference-of-convex programming, which approaches a local
optimum of the BMI problem via solving a series of convex optimization
problems. This algorithm is incorporated in a branch-and-bound framework that
searches for the global optimum in a divide-and-conquer fashion. We present a
weak completeness result of our method, in the sense that a barrier certificate
is guaranteed to be found (under some mild assumptions) whenever there exists
an inductive invariant (in the form of a given template) that suffices to
certify safety of the system. Experimental results on benchmark examples
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

these pairs of primal-dual problems are established. The results just obtained
are then applied to a general class (CCCV) of composed vector optimization
problems with cone-constrained. For this classes of problems, four perturbation

Existing automatic segmentation methods are mainly based on fully supervised

an automatic CT segmentation method based on weakly supervised learning, by
which one could train an accurate segmentation model only with weak annotations
in the form of bounding boxes. The proposed method is composed of two steps: 1)
generating pseudo masks with bounding box annotations by k-means clustering,
and 2) iteratively training a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network as a
segmentation model. Some data pre-processing methods are used to improve
performance. The method was validated on four datasets containing three types
of organs with a total of 627 CT volumes. For liver, spleen and kidney
segmentation, it achieved an accuracy of 95.19%, 92.11%, and 91.45%,

The height of the loss peak saturates as full penetration of magnetic field is

with increasing magnetic field amplitude for both HIIc and HIIab. The value of
Tp depends on the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the
crystallographic axes, illustrating the anisotropy in the magnetic flux
dynamics. The superconducting transition width increases weakly with increasing
magnetic field. The Cole-Cole plot [\c{hi}""(\c{hi}')] shows qualitatively and

round off value of the recently estimated value of $I_{\rm Crab,45} \geq 1.93$
(Bejger \& Haensel 2003) for the Crab pulsar. If this value of lower bound is
combined with the other observational constraint obtained for the Crab pulsar
(Crawford \& Demiansky 2003), $G_h = I_{\rm core}/I_{\rm total} \geq 0.7$ (
where $G_h$ is called the glitch healing parameter and represents the
fractional moment of inertia of the core component in the starquake mechanism
of glitch generation), the models yield the mass, $M$, and surface redshift,
$z_a$, for the Crab pulsar in the range, $M = 1.79M_\odot - 1.88M_\odot$; $z_a
= 0.374 - 0.393$ ($I_{45} = 2$) for an assigned value of the surface density,
$E_a = 2\times 10^{14}\rm g{cm}^{-3}$ (like, Brecher and Caporaso 1976). This
assigned value of surface density, in fact, is an outcome of the first
observational constraint imposed on our models that further yields the mass $M
= 1.96M_\odot $ and surface redshift $z_a=$ 0.414 ($I_{45}= 2$) for the values
of $G_h \approx 0.12$, which actually belongs to the observed `central'

redshift predict the energy of a gravitationally redshifted electron-positron
annihilation line, $E (\rm {MeV}) = 0.511/(1+z_a)$ (Lindblom 1984) in the range
about 0.396 - 401 MeV from the Crab and about 0.389 MeV from the Vela pulsar.
The evidence of a line feature at about 0.40MeV from the Crab pulsar (Leventhal

labeled data. Deep learning methods for HSI classification usually follow a
patchwise learning framework. Recently, a fast patch-free global learning
(FPGA) architecture was proposed for HSI classification according to global
spatial context information. However, FPGA has difficulty extracting the most
discriminative features when the sample data is imbalanced. In this paper, a
spectral-spatial dependent global learning (SSDGL) framework based on global
convolutional long short-term memory (GCL) and global joint attention mechanism
(GJAM) is proposed for insufficient and imbalanced HSI classification. In
SSDGL, the hierarchically balanced (H-B) sampling strategy and the weighted
softmax loss are proposed to address the imbalanced sample problem. To
effectively distinguish similar spectral characteristics of land cover types,
the GCL module is introduced to extract the long short-term dependency of
spectral features. To learn the most discriminative feature representations,
the GJAM module is proposed to extract attention areas. The experimental
results obtained with three public HSI datasets show that the SSDGL has
powerful performance in insufficient and imbalanced sample problems and is
superior to other state-of-the-art methods. Code can be obtained at:

underestimate the risk of infection for short and direct exposure. To this end,
we estimate the upper bound for infection risk with the susceptible in the
infectious exhalation cloud or wearing masks by having the masked susceptible
inhale the entire exhalation of a masked infectious. Social distances without a
mask, even at 3m between speaking individuals results in an upper bound of 90\%
for risk of infection after a few minutes. If both wear a surgical mask, the
risk of infection for the person speaking remains below 26\% even after 60
minutes. When both the infectious and susceptible wear a well-fitting FFP2
mask, the upper bound for risk is reduced by a factor of 60 compared to
surgical masks. In both cases, face leakage is very important. For FFP2 masks,
leakage is low in the nasal region and directed upward, which can be further
reduced significantly by applying double-sided medical tape there. Considering
that the calculated upper bound greatly overestimates the risk of infection,
and the fact that with a poorly worn mask even the upper bound we calculated is
very low, we conclude that wearing a mask, even with some leakage, provides
excellent third party and self-protection.

Internet of Things (IoT). Due to the inherent structural properties (e.g.,
sparsity) existing in many signals of interest, compressive sensing (CS)
technology has been extensively used for data collection in IoT to improve both
accuracy and energy efficiency. Apart from the existing works which leverage CS
as a channel coding scheme to deal with data loss during transmission, some
recent results have started to employ CS as a source coding strategy. The
frequently used projection matrices in these CS-based source coding schemes
include dense random matrices (e.g., Gaussian matrices or Bernoulli matrices)
and structured matrices (e.g., Toeplitz matrices). However, these matrices are
either difficult to be implemented on resource-constrained IoT sensor nodes or
have limited applicability. To address these issues, in this paper, we design a
novel simple and efficient projection matrix, named sparse Gaussian matrix,
which is easy and resource-saving to be implemented in practical IoT
applications. We conduct both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation
of the designed sparse Gaussian matrix. The results demonstrate that employing
the designed projection matrix to perform CS-based source coding could
significantly save time and memory cost while ensuring satisfactory signal

(e.g., Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn), wherein the platforms have consumers,

treatment variant can be done via simple online A/B testing. Producer side
measurement is more challenging because the producer experience depends on the
treatment assignment of the consumers. Existing approaches for producer side
measurement are either based on graph cluster-based randomization or on certain
treatment propagation assumptions. The former approach results in low-powered
experiments as the producer-consumer network density increases and the latter
approach lacks a strict notion of error control. In this paper, we propose (i)
a quantification of the quality of a producer side experiment design, and (ii)
a new experiment design mechanism that generates high-quality experiments based

the proposed design quality measure. Our approach is agnostic to the density of
the producer-consumer network and does not rely on any treatment propagation
assumption. Moreover, unlike the existing approaches, we do not need to know
the underlying network in advance, making this widely applicable to the
industrial setting where the underlying network is unknown and challenging to
predict a priori due to its dynamic nature. We use simulations to validate our
approach and compare it against existing methods. We also deployed UniCoRn in
an edge recommendation application that serves tens of millions of members and
billions of edge recommendations daily.

authorities have announced various non-pharmaceutical policies. Analyzing the
causal impact of these policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19 is important
for future policy-making. The main challenge here is the existence of
unobserved confounders (e.g., vigilance of residents). Besides, as the
confounders may be time-varying during COVID-19 (e.g., vigilance of residents
changes in the course of the pandemic), it is even more difficult to capture
them. In this paper, we study the problem of assessing the causal effects of
different COVID-19 related policies on the outbreak dynamics in different
counties at any given time period. To this end, we integrate data about
different COVID-19 related policies (treatment) and outbreak dynamics (outcome)
for different United States counties over time and analyze them with respect to
variables that can infer the confounders, including the covariates of different
counties, their relational information and historical information. Based on
these data, we develop a neural network based causal effect estimation
framework which leverages above information in observational data and learns
the representations of time-varying (unobserved) confounders. In this way, it
enables us to quantify the causal impact of policies at different
granularities, ranging from a category of policies with a certain goal to a
specific policy type in this category. Besides, experimental results also
indicate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in capturing the
confounders for quantifying the causal impact of different policies. More
specifically, compared with several baseline methods, our framework captures
the outbreak dynamics more accurately, and our assessment of policies is more
consistent with existing epidemiological studies of COVID-19.

the solution of Navier-Stokes equations in complex domains. The algorithm
discretizes partial derivatives at scattered points using radial basis
functions as interpolants. Higher-order polynomials are appended to
polyharmonic splines (PHS-RBF) and a collocation method is used to derive the
interpolation coefficients. The interpolating kernels are then differentiated
and the partial-differential equations are satisfied by collocation at the
scattered points. The PHS-RBF interpolation is shown to be exponentially
convergent with discretization errors decreasing as a high power of a
representative distance between points. We present here a semi-implicit
algorithm for time-dependent and steady state fluid flows in complex domains.
At each time step, several iterations are performed to converge the momentum
and continuity equations. A Poisson equation for pressure corrections is
formulated by imposing divergence free condition on the iterated velocity
field. At each time step, the momentum and pressure correction equations are
repeatedly solved until the velocities and pressure converge to a pre-specified
tolerance. We have demonstrated the convergence and discretization accuracy of
the algorithm for two model problems and simulated three other complex
problems. In all cases, the algorithm is stable for Courant numbers in excess

and 48 ""General"" protocols. The DL Models were assessed in an ""auto-protocoling
(AP)"" inference mode which returns the top recommendation and in a ""clinical
decision support (CDS)"" inference mode which returns up to 10 protocols for
radiologist review. The accuracy of each protocol recommendation was computed
and analyzed based on the difference between the normalized output score of the
corresponding neural net for the top two recommendations.
  Results: The top predicted protocol in AP mode was correct for 82.8%, 73.8%,
and 69.3% of the test cases for ""General"", ""ACR"", and ""Local"" protocol classes,
respectively. Higher levels of accuracy over 96% were obtained for all protocol
classes in CDS mode. However, at current validation performance levels, the
proposed models offer modest, positive, financial impact on large-scale imaging
networks.
  Conclusions: DL-based protocol automation is feasible and can be tuned to
route substantial fractions of exams for auto-protocoling, with higher accuracy
with more general protocols. Economic analyses of the tested algorithms
indicate that improved algorithm performance is required to yield a practical
exam auto-protocoling tool for sub-specialized imaging exams.

is widely recognized, particularly in geomaterials, but also in biomaterials
and engineered materials. Recent advances in imaging techniques, such as X-ray
microcomputed tomography, and in modeling make it possible to capture the exact
morphometry of the microstructure with high precision. However, most existing
continuum theories only partially account for the morphometry. We propose here
a unifying approach to link the strength of porous materials with the necessary
and sufficient microstructural information, using Minkowski functionals, as per
Hadwiger's theorem. A morphometric strength law is inferred from synthetic
microstructures with a wide range of porosities and heterogeneities, through
qualitative 2D phase-field simulations. Namely, the damage is modeled at the
microstructural level by tracking the solid-pore interfaces under mechanical
loading. The strength is found to be best described by an exponential function
of the morphometers, thus generalizing early works on metals and ceramics. We
then show that the predictiveness of this relationship extends to real porous
media, including rocks and bones.

  Network-on-Chip System","17 pages, 7 figures, submitted to FMICS 2021",,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Modern network-on-chip (NoC) systems face reliability issues due to process
and environmental variations. The power supply noise (PSN) in the power
delivery network of a NoC plays a key role in determining reliability. PSN
leads to voltage droop, which can cause timing errors in the NoC. This paper
makes a novel contribution towards formally analyzing PSN in NoC systems. We
present a probabilistic model checking approach to observe the PSN in a generic
2x2 mesh NoC with a uniform random traffic load. Key features of PSN are
measured at the behavioral level. To tackle state explosion, we apply
incremental abstraction techniques, including a novel probabilistic choice
abstraction, based on observations of NoC behavior. The Modest Toolset is used
for probabilistic modeling and verification. Results are obtained for several
flit injection patterns to reveal their impacts on PSN. Our analysis finds an
optimal flit pattern generation with zero probability of PSN events and
suggests spreading flits rather than releasing them in consecutive cycles in
order to minimize PSN.
