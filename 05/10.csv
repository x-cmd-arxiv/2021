different research areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology. At first glance,
DNA-based nanophotonics seems to deviate quite far from the original goal of
Nadrian Seeman, the founder of DNA nanotechnology, who hoped to organize
biological entities using DNA in high-resolution crystals. As a matter of fact,
DNA-based nanophotonics does closely follow his central spirit. That is, apart
from being a genetic material for inheritance, DNA is also an ideal material
for building molecular devices.

from the X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars is very close to the dipole direction
given by the ""Joint Light-curve Analysis"" (JLA) compilation in the Finslerian
cosmological model and the angular difference between the two dipole directions
is only $10.44^{\circ}$. We also find the angular difference between the dipole
direction from the 808 quasars in the Finslerian cosmological model and ones
from the supernovae of type Ia (SNe Ia) samples in the dipole-modulated
$\Lambda$CDM model is around $30^{\circ}$. Six gravitationally lensed quasars
are considered to investigate the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the Finslerian
cosmological model. We get a slightly smaller $H_0$ than the result given by
the six gravitationally lensed quasars. Finally, we forecast the future
constraints on the dipole parameters with the X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars.
As the number of simulations increases, the precisions of the parameters
related to anisotropy in the Finslerian cosmological model improve
significantly. The X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars have a promising future as a
probe of anisotropy in Finsler spacetime.

  Hyperbolic Space",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning the representation of data with hierarchical structures in the
hyperbolic space attracts increasing attention in recent years. Due to the
constant negative curvature, the hyperbolic space resembles tree metrics and
captures the tree-like properties naturally, which enables the hyperbolic
embeddings to improve over traditional Euclidean models. However, many
real-world hierarchically structured data such as taxonomies and multitree
networks have varying local structures and they are not trees, thus they do not
ubiquitously match the constant curvature property of the hyperbolic space. To
address this limitation of hyperbolic embeddings, we explore the complex
hyperbolic space, which has the variable negative curvature, for representation
learning. Specifically, we propose to learn the embeddings of hierarchically
structured data in the unit ball model of the complex hyperbolic space. The
unit ball model based embeddings have a more powerful representation capacity
to capture a variety of hierarchical structures. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, we show that our approach improves over the
hyperbolic embedding models significantly. We also explore the competence of
complex hyperbolic geometry on the multitree structure and $1$-$N$ structure.

  At the heart of our approach lies a careful usage of Kneser's theorem from

limits of sequences of Sobolev maps whose gradients on the fibers lie in the

the sense that they locally preserve length in the fiber direction. Our proof
of the necessity emerges as a natural generalization and modification of the
recently established asymptotic rigidity analysis for composites with layered
reinforcements. However, the construction of approximating sequences is more
delicate here due to the higher flexibility and connectedness of the soft
material component. We overcome these technical challenges by a careful
approximation of the identity that is constant on the rigid components,
combined with a lifting in fiber bundles for Sobolev functions. The results are
illustrated with several examples of attainable effective deformations. If an
additional second-order regularization is introduced into the material model,
only rigid body motions can occur macroscopically.

density shows no clear evidence of critical fluctuations and no indication of
vortex unbinding as T->Tc. Nevertheless, the superfluid density displays the
expected behavior for for a quantum phase transition (QPT) in the (3+1)D-xy
universality class, rho(T=0)~Tc^2. However, this relation is also a hallmark of
dirty superconductors, treated in the mean-field approximation. Here we attempt
to clear out the nature of the suppression of ro(T) as Tc->0. Noting that for
any finite system the continuous transition will be rounded we perform a finite
size scaling analysis. It uncovers that the ro(T) data data are consistent with
a finite length limited 3D-xy transition. In some films it is their thickness
and in others their inhomogeneity that determines the limiting length. Having
established the precondition for the occurrence of a QPT mapping on the (3+1)
D-xy model, we explore the consistency with the hallmarks of this transition.
In particular with the relations rho(T)/rho(0)=1-ycT/Tc, rho((0)^Tc^2,
yc=alpha*Tc/ro(0), where alpha is the coefficient in rho(T)=rho(0)-alphaT as
T->0. The emerging agreement with these characteristics points clearly to a
quantum fluctuations induced suppression, revealing the crossover from the
thermal to the quantum critical regime as Tc ->0. In the classical-quantum
mapping it corresponds to a 3D to (3 + 1)D crossover.

studied and applied in the last decade. In a recent effort, many control-affine
ESC structures have been generalized in a unifying class and their stability
was analyzed. However, guaranteeing vanishing oscillations at the extremum
point for said class requires strong conditions that may not be feasible or
easy to check/design by the user, especially when the gradient of the objective
function is unknown. In this paper, we introduce a control-affine ESC structure
that remedies this problem such that: (i) its oscillations attenuate
structurally via a novel application of a geometric-based Kalman filter and a
Lie bracket estimation approach; and (ii) its stability is characterized by a
time-dependent (one-bound) condition that is easier to check and relaxed when
compared to the generalized approach mentioned earlier. We provide numerical
simulations of three problems to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
ESC; these problems cannot be solved with vanishing oscillations using the
generalized approach in the literature.

matching complex of the Tait graph of a plane graph $G$, in terms of subgraphs
determined by certain matchings on the dual of G. We then use one of these
homologies, in the case where X is a graph, to define a conjecturally optimal
dissimilarity pseudometric for graphs; we prove various results for this
dissimilarity and provide several computations. We further show that, by
organising the horizontal homologies of a simplicial complex in the poset of
its colourings, we obtain a triply graded homology theory which we call
\""uberhomology. This latter homology is not a homotopy invariant, but
nonetheless encodes both combinatorial and topological information on X. For

its lowest degree, while for an homology manifold it coincides with the
fundamental class in its top degree. We compute the \""uberhomology on several

incomplete description of either porosity field, injection flux, or both. The
uncertainty in the total-velocity field leads to the spatiotemporal uncertainty
in the saturation field. Given information about the spatial/temporal
statistics of the correlated heterogeneity, we leverage method of distributions
to derive deterministic equations that govern the evolution of single-point CDF
of saturation. Unlike Buckley Leverett equation, the equation for the raw CDF
function is linear in space and time. Hereby, we give routes to circumventing
the computational cost of Monte Carlo scheme while obtaining the full
statistical description of saturation. We conduct a set of numerical
experiments and compare statistics of saturation computed with the method of
distributions, against those obtained using the statistical moment equations
approach and kernel density estimation post-processing of high-resolution Monte
Carlo simulations. This comparison demonstrates that the CDF equations remain
accurate over a wide range of statistical properties, i.e. standard deviation

low-order statistical moment equations significantly deviate from Monte Carlo

ALL classification strategy demands experienced pathologists to carefully read
the cell images, which is arduous, time-consuming, and often suffers
inter-observer variations. This article has automated the ALL detection task
from microscopic cell images, employing deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). We explore the weighted ensemble of different deep CNNs to recommend a
better ALL cell classifier. The weights for the ensemble candidate models are
estimated from their corresponding metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score, AUC,
and kappa values. Various data augmentations and pre-processing are
incorporated for achieving a better generalization of the network. We utilize
the publicly available C-NMC-2019 ALL dataset to conduct all the comprehensive
experiments. Our proposed weighted ensemble model, using the kappa values of
the ensemble candidates as their weights, has outputted a weighted F1-score of
88.6 %, a balanced accuracy of 86.2 %, and an AUC of 0.941 in the preliminary
test set. The qualitative results displaying the gradient class activation maps
confirm that the introduced model has a concentrated learned region. In
contrast, the ensemble candidate models, such as Xception, VGG-16,
DenseNet-121, MobileNet, and InceptionResNet-V2, separately produce coarse and

infer the plasma frequency and hence density. We present the detection of a

include thermally excited plasma oscillations and quasi-thermal noise, and
could be clarified by new findings from Voyager or a future interstellar

adversarial robustness for DNNs through efficiency-driven hardware
optimizations. Since memory (specifically, dot-product operations) is a key
energy-spending component for DNNs, hardware approaches in the past have
focused on optimizing the memory. One such approach is approximate digital CMOS
memories with hybrid 6T-8T SRAM cells that enable supply voltage (Vdd) scaling
yielding low-power operation, without significantly affecting the performance
due to read/write failures incurred in the 6T cells. In this paper, we show how
the bit-errors in the 6T cells of hybrid 6T-8T memories minimize the
adversarial perturbations in a DNN. Essentially, we find that for different
configurations of 8T-6T ratios and scaledVdd operation, noise incurred in the
hybrid memory architectures is bound within specific limits. This hardware
noise can potentially interfere in the creation of adversarial attacks in DNNs
yielding robustness. Another memory optimization approach involves using analog
memristive crossbars that perform Matrix-Vector-Multiplications (MVMs)
efficiently with low energy and area requirements. However, crossbars generally
suffer from intrinsic non-idealities that cause errors in performing MVMs,
leading to degradation in the accuracy of the DNNs. We will show how the
intrinsic hardware variations manifested through crossbar non-idealities yield
adversarial robustness to the mapped DNNs without any additional optimization.

where an agent makes a sequence of online decisions to minimize the
accumulation of time-varying convex loss functions, subject to short-term and
long-term constraints that are possibly time-varying. The current convex loss
function and the long-term constraint function are revealed to the agent only
after the decision is made, and they may be delayed for multiple time slots.
Existing work on OCO under this general setting has focused on the static
regret, which measures the gap of losses between the online decision sequence
and an offline benchmark that is fixed over time. In this work, we consider
both the static regret and the more practically meaningful dynamic regret,
where the benchmark is a time-varying sequence of per-slot optimizers. We
propose an efficient algorithm, termed Delay-Tolerant Constrained-OCO
(DTC-OCO), which uses a novel constraint penalty with double regularization to
tackle the asynchrony between information feedback and decision updates. We
derive upper bounds on its dynamic regret, static regret, and constraint
violation, proving them to be sublinear under mild conditions. We further apply
DTC-OCO to a general network resource allocation problem, which arises in many
systems such as data networks and cloud computing. Simulation results
demonstrate substantial performance gain of DTC-OCO over the known best
alternative.

finance, often exhibit imbalanced class priors and have asynchronous
misclassification costs. In such cases, the classification model must achieve a
high recall without significantly impacting precision. Resampling the training
data is the standard approach to improving classification performance on
imbalanced binary data. However, the state-of-the-art methods ignore the local
joint distribution of the data or correct it as a post-processing step. This
can causes sub-optimal shifts in the training distribution, particularly when
the target data distribution is complex. In this paper, we propose Radial-Based
Combined Cleaning and Resampling (RB-CCR). RB-CCR utilizes the concept of class
potential to refine the energy-based resampling approach of CCR. In particular,
RB-CCR exploits the class potential to accurately locate sub-regions of the
data-space for synthetic oversampling. The category sub-region for oversampling
can be specified as an input parameter to meet domain-specific needs or be
automatically selected via cross-validation. Our $5\times2$ cross-validated
results on 57 benchmark binary datasets with 9 classifiers show that RB-CCR
achieves a better precision-recall trade-off than CCR and generally
out-performs the state-of-the-art resampling methods in terms of AUC and

multichannel edge as thermal reservoirs, we particularly focus on the
line-junction model for the contacts and investigate incoherent charge
transport for an arbitrary strength of interchannel interaction beneath the
contacts and, possibly different, outside them. We show that the conductance
does not explicitly depend on the interaction strength either in or outside the
contact regions (implicitly, it only depends through renormalization of the
tunneling rates). Rather, a long line-junction contact is characterized by a
single parameter which defines the modes that are at thermal equilibrium with
the contact and is determined by the interplay of various types of scattering
beneath the contact. This parameter -- playing the role of an effective
interaction strength within an idealized model of thermal reservoirs -- is
generically nonzero and affects the conductance. We formulate a framework of
fractionalization-renormalized tunneling to describe the effect of disorder on
transport in the presence of interchannel interaction. Within this framework,
we give a detailed discussion of charge equilibration for arbitrarily strong

gradients are computed by fully considering the lattice-skin coupling while the
lattice topology and shape optimisation problems are solved in a sequential
manner. The shell is modelled as a Kirchhoff-Love shell and analysed using
isogeometric subdivision surfaces, whereas the lattice is modelled as a
pin-jointed truss. The lattice consists of many cells, possibly of different
sizes, with each containing a small number of struts. We propose a penalisation
approach akin to the SIMP (solid isotropic material with penalisation) method
for topology optimisation of the lattice. Furthermore, a corresponding
sensitivity filter and a lattice extraction technique are introduced to ensure
the stability of the optimisation process and to eliminate scattered struts of
small cross-sectional areas. The developed topology optimisation technique is
suitable for non-periodic, non-uniform lattices. For shape optimisation of both
the shell and the lattice, the geometry of the lattice-skin structure is
parameterised using the free-form deformation technique. The topology and shape
optimisation problems are solved in an iterative, sequential manner. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach and the influence of different

using Semantic Clustering by Adopting Nearest-Neighbors (SCAN). For each

representation space tend to share topic labels. Our learnable clustering
approach uses pairs of neighboring datapoints as a weak learning signal. The
proposed approach learns to assign classes to the whole dataset without
provided ground-truth labels. On five topic classification benchmarks, we
improve on various unsupervised baselines by a large margin. In datasets with
relatively few and balanced outcome classes, DocSCAN approaches the performance
of supervised classification. The method fails for other types of
classification, such as sentiment analysis, pointing to important conceptual
and practical differences between classifying images and texts.

luminosity, L(H$\beta$), and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) for HII
galaxies (HIIG). These results are based on new VLT-KMOS high spectral
resolution observations of 41 high-z ($1.3 \leq$ z $\leq 2.6$) HIIG combined
with published data for 45 high-z and 107 z $\leq 0.15$ HIIG, while the
cosmological analysis is based on the MultiNest MCMC procedure not considering
systematic uncertainties. Using only HIIG to constrain the matter density
parameter ($\Omega_m$), we find $\Omega_m = 0.244^{+0.040}_{-0.049}$ (stat), an
improvement over our best previous cosmological parameter constraints, as
indicated by a 37% increase of the FoM. The marginalised best-fit parameter
values for the plane $\{\Omega_m; w_0\}$ = $\{0.249^{+0.11}_{-0.065};
-1.18^{+0.45}_{-0.41}\}$ (stat) show an improvement of the cosmological
parameters constraints by 40%. Combining the HIIG Hubble diagram, the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) and the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) probes
yields $\Omega_m=0.298 \pm 0.012$ and $w_0=-1.005 \pm 0.051$, which are
certainly compatible -- although less constraining -- than the solution based
on the joint analysis of SNIa/CMB/BAO. An attempt to constrain the evolution of
the dark energy with time (CPL model), using a joint analysis of the HIIG, CMB
and BAO measurements, shows a degenerate 1$\sigma$ contour of the parameters in
the $\{w_0,w_a\}$ plane.

The blazar OJ 287 has been proposed as a binary black hole system
based on its periodic optical outburst. Among blazars with parsec scale jets,
the black hole binary systems are very rare and hence this source is very
interesting to study. Aims. The BL Lac OJ 287 is an interesting object for
multi-wavelength study due to its periodic outbursts. We have analyzed the
optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray data of OJ 287 for the period of 2017-2020. There
are several high states in optical-UV and X-ray frequencies during this period.
Based on the observed variability in optical and X-ray frequencies the entire
period 2017-2020 is divided into five segments, referred to as A, B, C, D, & E
in this paper. A detailed temporal and spectral analysis is performed to
understand the nature of its flaring activities. Methods. To understand the
temporal variability in this source we have studied the intra-day, and
fractional variability for all the various states, and along with that fast
variability time was also estimated to understand the nature of variability.
Further, the multi-wavelength SED modeling is performed to know more about the
physical processes responsible for the simultaneous broadband emission and the
fast variability. Results. The Fermi-LAT observations show a moderate flux
level of this source in gamma-ray frequency throughout this period, though flux
variability has been observed. The source has shown a strong flux variability
in X-ray, optical, and UV during early 2017 and mid-2020 when the source was in
a very high state. A single zone SSC emission model is considered to model the
spectral energy distributions and this helps us to explore the nature of this
BL Lac with binary super-massive black holes.

  polyphase upsampling",,,,,"cs.CV eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional neural networks lack shift equivariance due to the presence of
downsampling layers. In image classification, adaptive polyphase downsampling
(APS-D) was recently proposed to make CNNs perfectly shift invariant. However,
in networks used for image reconstruction tasks, it can not by itself restore
shift equivariance. We address this problem by proposing adaptive polyphase
upsampling (APS-U), a non-linear extension of conventional upsampling, which
allows CNNs with symmetric encoder-decoder architecture (for example U-Net) to
exhibit perfect shift equivariance. With MRI and CT reconstruction experiments,
we show that networks containing APS-D/U layers exhibit state of the art
equivariance performance without sacrificing on image reconstruction quality.
In addition, unlike prior methods like data augmentation and anti-aliasing, the
gains in equivariance obtained from APS-D/U also extend to images outside the
training distribution.

this paper. The same maximum LUE is used for both sunlit and shaded leaves, and
the difference in LUE between sunlit and shaded leaf groups is determined by
the same radiation scalar. The RTL-LUE model was calibrated and validated at
global 169 FLUXNET eddy covariance (EC) sites. Results indicate that although
GPP simulations from the TL-LUE model match well with the EC GPP, the RTL-LUE
model can further improve the simulation, for half-hour, 8-day, and yearly time
scales. The TL-LUE model tends to overestimate GPP under conditions of high
incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), because the
radiation-independent LUE values for both sunlit and shaded leaves are only
suitable for low-medium (e.g. average) incoming PAR conditions. The errors in
the RTL-LUE model show lower sensitivity to PAR, and its GPP simulations can
better track the diurnal and seasonal variations of EC GPP by alleviating the
overestimation at noon and growing seasons associated with the TL-LUE model.
This study demonstrates the necessity of considering a radiation scalar in GPP
simulation in LUE models even if the first-order effect of radiation is already
considered through differentiating sunlit and shaded leaves. The simple RTL-LUE
developed in this study would be a useful alternative to complex process-based
models for global carbon cycle research.

$O(n^{5/2} \sqrt{\varepsilon})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the closeness of the

nonparametric estimation of a singular distribution using deep generative
models. More specifically, a deep generative model is used to model
high-dimensional data that are assumed to concentrate around some
low-dimensional structure. Estimating the distribution supported on this
low-dimensional structure, such as a low-dimensional manifold, is challenging
due to its singularity with respect to the Lebesgue measure in the ambient
space. In the considered model, a usual likelihood approach can fail to
estimate the target distribution consistently due to the singularity. We prove
that a novel and effective solution exists by perturbing the data with an
instance noise, which leads to consistent estimation of the underlying
distribution with desirable convergence rates. We also characterize the class
of distributions that can be efficiently estimated via deep generative models.
This class is sufficiently general to contain various structured distributions
such as product distributions, classically smooth distributions and
distributions supported on a low-dimensional manifold. Our analysis provides
some insights on how deep generative models can avoid the curse of
dimensionality for nonparametric distribution estimation. We conduct a thorough
simulation study and real data analysis to empirically demonstrate that the

significantly.

where different wavelengths of light propagate at different phase velocities,
has remained a largely unsolved challenge until now. This is astonishing in
view of the excellent theoretical understanding of Maxwell's equations and the
abundant experimental measurements of optical phenomena in dispersive media.
The challenge is related to the complexity of the interference patterns of
partial waves and to the coupling of the field and medium dynamics by the
optical force. In this work, we use the mass-polariton theory of light [Phys.
Rev. A 96, 063834 (2017)] to derive the stress-energy-momentum (SEM) tensors of
the field and the dispersive medium. Our starting point, the fundamental local
conservation laws of energy and momentum, is close to that of a recent
theoretical work on light in dispersive media by Philbin [Phys. Rev. A 83,
013823 (2011)], which however, excludes the power-conversion and force density
source terms describing the coupling between the field and the medium. In the
general inertial frame, we present the SEM tensors in terms of Lorentz scalars,
four-vectors, and field tensors that reflect in a transparent way the Lorentz
covariance of the theory. The SEM tensors of the field and the medium are
symmetric, form-invariant, and in full accordance with the covariance principle
of the special theory of relativity. The SEM tensor of the coupled field-medium
state of light also has zero four-divergence. Therefore, light in a dispersive
medium has well-defined four-momentum and rest frame. The volume integrals of
the total energy and momentum densities of light agree with the model of
mass-polariton quasiparticles having a nonzero rest mass. The predictions of
our work are directly accessible to experiments.

Here, we provide preliminary calculations suggesting that the

supervised VAD systems obtain frame-level labels from an ASR pipeline by using,
e.g., a Hidden Markov model. These ASR models are commonly trained on clean and
fully transcribed data, limiting VAD systems to be trained on clean or
synthetically noised datasets. Therefore, a major challenge for supervised VAD
systems is their generalization towards noisy, real-world data. This work
proposes a data-driven teacher-student approach for VAD, which utilizes vast
and unconstrained audio data for training. Unlike previous approaches, only
weak labels during teacher training are required, enabling the utilization of
any real-world, potentially noisy dataset. Our approach firstly trains a
teacher model on a source dataset (Audioset) using clip-level supervision.
After training, the teacher provides frame-level guidance to a student model on
an unlabeled, target dataset. A multitude of student models trained on mid- to
large-sized datasets are investigated (Audioset, Voxceleb, NIST SRE). Our
approach is then respectively evaluated on clean, artificially noised, and
real-world data. We observe significant performance gains in artificially
noised and real-world scenarios. Lastly, we compare our approach against other
unsupervised and supervised VAD methods, demonstrating our method's
superiority.

key-shot based video summarization. Current approaches mainly devote to
modeling the video as a frame sequence by recurrent neural networks. However,
one potential limitation of the sequence models is that they focus on capturing
local neighborhood dependencies while the high-order dependencies in long
distance are not fully exploited. In general, the frames in each shot record a
certain activity and vary smoothly over time, but the multi-hop relationships
occur frequently among shots. In this case, both the local and global
dependencies are important for understanding the video content. Motivated by
this point, we propose a Reconstructive Sequence-Graph Network (RSGN) to encode
the frames and shots as sequence and graph hierarchically, where the
frame-level dependencies are encoded by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the
shot-level dependencies are captured by the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
Then, the videos are summarized by exploiting both the local and global
dependencies among shots. Besides, a reconstructor is developed to reward the
summary generator, so that the generator can be optimized in an unsupervised
manner, which can avert the lack of annotated data in video summarization.
Furthermore, under the guidance of reconstruction loss, the predicted summary
can better preserve the main video content and shot-level dependencies.
Practically, the experimental results on three popular datasets i.e., SumMe,
TVsum and VTW) have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed approach to
the summarization task.

quality through the incorporation of extended feature maps.
\textit{Unsupervised Attribute Directing and Manipulation} enables

vary in Brazil due to the territorial extension of the country, its relief,
geography, and other factors. Since the most common COVID-19 symptoms are
related to the respiratory system, many researchers have studied the
correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases with meteorological variables
like temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc. Also, due to its high transmission
rate, some researchers have analyzed the impact of human mobility on the
dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. There is a dearth of literature that
considers these two variables when predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases. In
this paper, we analyzed the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases
and human mobility, and meteorological data in Brazilian capitals. We found
that the correlation between such variables depends on the regions where the
cities are located. We employed the variables with a significant correlation
with COVID-19 cases to predict the number of COVID-19 infections in all

method (MsFEM). We show that the coarse part is of \textit{low complexity} in
the sense that it can be approximated with a nearly exponential rate of
convergence via local basis functions, due to the compactness of a restriction
operator that maps Helmholtz-harmonic functions to their interpolation residues
on edges, while the fine part is \textit{local} such that it can be computed
efficiently using the local information of the right hand side. The combination
of the two parts yields the overall nearly exponential rate of convergence of
our multiscale method. Our method draws many connections to multiscale methods
in the literature, which we will comment in detail. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods theoretically and numerically; an exponential rate
of convergence is consistently observed and confirmed. In addition, we observe
the robustness of our methods regarding the high contrast in the media
numerically. We specifically focus on 2D problems in our exposition since the
geometry of non-overlapped domain decomposition is simplest to explain in such
cases; generalizations to 3D will be outlined at the end.

damper system for improving the reaction of steel frame buildings that have
been exposed to several levels of seismic threat. The planned superelastic
memory alloy re-centering damper (SMARD) relies on high-performance shape
memory alloy (SMA) bars for its abilities of recentering and augments its
deformation potential with friction springs. To begin, this study investigates
the superelastic reaction of NiTiHfPd SMAs under a variety of conditions and
shows how they can be used in seismic applications. To gather experimental
results, uniaxial experiments on superelastic NiTiHfPd SMAs are performed at
temperatures ranging from -35 to 25 oC and loading frequencies ranging from
0.05 to 1 Hz with four distinct strain amplitudes. We explore the impact of
loading rate and temperature on the superelastic properties of NiTiHfPd SMAs.
The complex answer of 6-floor and 9-floor steel special moment frame buildings
with built SMARDs is then determined using an empirical model. Finally,
nonlinear reaction time background simulations are used to characterize the
actions of managed and unregulated buildings while 44 ground motion data are
used. The results indicate that SMARDs will significantly reduce the dynamic
behavior of steel-frame buildings at various seismic threat levels while
simultaneously improving their post-earthquake functionality.

increase, large-scale software systems have an increasing requirement for
high-performance distributed computing systems. With the acceleration of the

uncertain and elastic services has shown superiorities to meet the computing
needs dynamically. Without an appropriate scheduling approach, extensive Cloud
computing may cause high energy consumptions and high cost, in addition that
high energy consumption will cause massive carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover,
inappropriate scheduling will reduce the service life of physical devices as
well as increase response time to users' request. Hence, efficient scheduling
of resource or optimal allocation of request, that usually a NP-hard problem,
is one of the prominent issues in emerging trends of Cloud computing. Focusing
on improving quality of service (QoS), reducing cost and abating contamination,
researchers have conducted extensive work on resource scheduling problems of
Cloud computing over years. Nevertheless, growing complexity of Cloud
computing, that the super-massive distributed system, is limiting the
application of scheduling approaches. Machine learning, a utility method to
tackle problems in complex scenes, is used to resolve the resource scheduling

Early content-based methods focused on finding clues from the text and user

semiparametric framework. The unknown link function permits flexible modeling
of the interactions between the treatment and the covariates, but leads to
nonconvex estimation in high dimension and imposes significant challenges for
inference. We first establish that a local restricted strong convexity
condition holds with high probability and that any feasible local sparse
solution of the estimation problem can achieve the near-oracle estimation error
bound. We further rigorously verify that a wild bootstrap procedure based on a
debiased version of the local solution can provide asymptotically honest
uniform inference for the effect of a group of variables on optimal decision
making. The advantage of honest inference is that it does not require the
initial estimator to achieve perfect model selection and does not require the

distribution of the Fe-peak elements. We have discovered an ejecta clump with
extremely high abundances of Ti and Cr, in addition to Mn, Fe, and Ni, in the
southern part of the SNR. The Fe mass of this ejecta clump is estimated to be
$\sim$ 0.06 $M_{\odot}$, under the assumption of a typical Fe yield for SNe Ia
(i.e., $\sim$ 0.8 $M_{\odot}$). The observed mass ratios among the Fe-peak
elements and Ti require substantial neutronization that is achieved only in the
innermost regions of a near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ SN Ia with a central density of
$\rho_c \sim 5 \times 10^9$ g cm$^{-3}$, significantly higher than typically
assumed for standard near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ SNe Ia ($\rho_c \sim 2 \times 10^9$ g
cm$^{-3}$). The overproduction of the neutron-rich isotopes (e.g., $^{50}$Ti
and $^{54}$Cr) is significant in such high-$\rho_c$ SNe Ia, with respect to the
solar composition. Therefore, if 3C 397 is a typical high-$\rho_c$ near-$M_{\rm
Ch}$ SN Ia remnant, the solar abundances of these isotopes could be reproduced
by the mixture of the high- and low-$\rho_c$ near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ and sub-$M_{\rm
Ch}$ Type Ia events, with $\lesssim$ 20 % being high-$\rho_c$ near-$M_{\rm
Ch}$.

semantic segmentation. However, how to effectively integrate multi-modality
information into representative features is still an open problem. Most of the
existing work uses DCNNs to implicitly fuse multi-modality information. But as
the network deepens, some critical distinguishing features may be lost, which
reduces the segmentation performance. This work proposes a unified and
efficient feature selectionand-fusion network (FSFNet), which contains a
symmetric cross-modality residual fusion module used for explicit fusion of
multi-modality information. Besides, the network includes a detailed feature
propagation module, which is used to maintain low-level detailed information
during the forward process of the network. Compared with the state-of-the-art

the field of architecture. One such opportunity is teaching neural networks to
visually understand architectural elements from the built environment. However,
the availability of large training datasets is one of the biggest limitations
of neural networks. Also, the vast majority of training data for visual
recognition tasks is annotated by humans. In order to resolve this bottleneck,
we present a concept of a hybrid system using both building information
modeling (BIM) and hyperrealistic (photorealistic) rendering to synthesize
datasets for training a neural network for building object recognition in
photos. For generating our training dataset BIMrAI, we used an existing BIM
model and a corresponding photo-realistically rendered model of the same
building. We created methods for using renderings to train a deep learning
model, trained a generative adversarial network (GAN) model using these
methods, and tested the output model on real-world photos. For the specific
case study presented in this paper, our results show that a neural network
trained with synthetic data; i.e., photorealistic renderings and BIM-based
semantic labels, can be used to identify building objects from photos without
using photos in the training data. Future work can enhance the presented
methods using available BIM models and renderings for more generalized mapping
and description of photographed built environments.

  Varying Susceptibility to Persuasion",,,,,"cs.SI cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, Abebe et al. (KDD 2018) and Chan et al. (WWW 2019) have considered
an opinion dynamics optimization problem that is based on a popular model for
social opinion dynamics, in which each agent has some fixed innate opinion, and
a resistance that measures the importance it places on its innate opinion;
moreover, the agents influence one another's opinions through an iterative
process. Under certain conditions, this iterative process converges to some
equilibrium opinion vector. Previous works gave an efficient local search
algorithm to solve the unbudgeted variant of the problem, for which the goal is
to modify the resistance of any number of agents (within some given range) such
that the sum of the equilibrium opinions is minimized. On the other hand, it
was proved that the $L_0$-budgeted variant is NP-hard, where the $L_0$-budget
is a restriction given upfront on the number of agents whose resistance may be
modified.
  Inspired by practical situations in which the effort to modify an agent's
resistance increases with the magnitude of the change, we propose the
$L_1$-budgeted variant, in which the $L_1$-budget is a restriction on the sum
of the magnitudes of the changes over all agents' resistance parameters. In
this work, we show that the $L_1$-budgeted variant is NP-hard via a reduction
from vertex cover. However, contrary to the $L_0$-budgeted variant, a very
technical argument is needed to show that the optimal solution can be achieved
by focusing the given $L_1$-budget on as small a number of agents as possible,
as opposed to spreading the budget over a large number of agents.

attention in the field of wireless communication. An RIS can be controlled to
reflect incident waves from the transmitter towards the receiver; a feature
that is believed to fundamentally contribute to beyond 5G wireless technology.
The typical RIS consists of entirely passive elements, which requires the
high-dimensional channel estimation to be done elsewhere. Therefore, in this
paper, we present a semi-passive large-scale RIS architecture equipped with
only a small fraction of simplified receiver units with only 1-bit
quantization. Based on this architecture, we first propose an alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based approach to recover the training
signals at the passive RIS elements, We then obtain the global channel by
combining a channel sparsification step with the generalized approximate
message passing (GAMP) algorithm. Our proposed scheme exploits both the
sparsity and low-rankness properties of the channel in the joint
spatial-frequency domain of a wideband mmWave multiple-input-multiple-output
(MIMO) communication system. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm can significantly reduce the pilot signaling needed for accurate
channel estimation and outperform previous methods, even with fewer receiver
units.

specifications of systems written in LF. This formalization centers around the
development of a reasoning logic that can express the sorts of properties which
arise in reasoning about such specifications. In this logic, type inhabitation
judgements in LF serve as atomic formulas, and quantification is permitted over
both contexts and terms in these judgements. The logic permits arbitrary
relations over derivations of LF judgements to be expressed using a collection
of logical connectives, in contrast to other systems for reasoning about LF
specifications. Defining a semantics for these formulas raises issues which we
must address, such as how to interpret both term and context quantification as
well as the relation between atomic formulas and the LF judgements they are
meant to encode.
  This thesis also develops a proof system which captures informal reasoning
steps as sound inference rules for the logic. To achieve this we develop a
collection of proof rules including mechanisms for both case analysis and
inductive reasoning over the derivations of judgements in LF. The proof system
also supports applying LF meta-theorems through proof rules that enforce
requirements of the LF meta-theorem that cannot be expressed in the logic.
  We also implement a proof assistant called Adelfa that provides a means for
mechanizing this approach to reasoning about specifications written in LF. A
characteristic of this proof assistant is that it uses the proof rules that
complement the logic to describe a collection of tactics that are used to
develop proofs in goal-driven fashion. The Adelfa system is used to develop a
collection of examples which demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and
showcase how informal reasoning about specifications written in LF can be
formalized using the logic and associated proof system.

  Learning","14 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the recent development of deep convolutional neural networks and
large-scale datasets, deep face recognition has made remarkable progress and
been widely used in various applications. However, unlike the existing public
face datasets, in many real-world scenarios of face recognition, the depth of
training dataset is shallow, which means only two face images are available for
each ID. With the non-uniform increase of samples, such issue is converted to a
more general case, a.k.a long-tail face learning, which suffers from data
imbalance and intra-class diversity dearth simultaneously. These adverse
conditions damage the training and result in the decline of model performance.
Based on the Semi-Siamese Training (SST), we introduce an advanced solution,
named Multi-Agent Semi-Siamese Training (MASST), to address these problems.
MASST includes a probe network and multiple gallery agents, the former aims to
encode the probe features, and the latter constitutes a stack of networks that
encode the prototypes (gallery features). For each training iteration, the
gallery network, which is sequentially rotated from the stack, and the probe
network form a pair of semi-siamese networks. We give the theoretical and
empirical analysis that, given the long-tail (or shallow) data and training
loss, MASST smooths the loss landscape and satisfies the Lipschitz continuity
with the help of multiple agents and the updating gallery queue. The proposed
method is out of extra-dependency, thus can be easily integrated with the
existing loss functions and network architectures. It is worth noting that,
although multiple gallery agents are employed for training, only the probe
network is needed for inference, without increasing the inference cost.
Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the advantages of MASST for
long-tail and shallow face learning.

expensive models for which derivative information is not readily available. The
Bayesian optimization (BO) framework is a particularly promising approach for
solving these problems, which uses Gaussian process (GP) models and an expected
utility function to systematically tradeoff between exploitation and
exploration of the design space. BO, however, is fundamentally limited by the
black-box model assumption that does not take into account any underlying
problem structure. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, COBALT, for
constrained grey-box optimization problems that combines multivariate GP models
with a novel constrained expected utility function whose structure can be
exploited by state-of-the-art nonlinear programming solvers. COBALT is compared
to traditional BO on seven test problems including the calibration of a
genome-scale bioreactor model to experimental data. Overall, COBALT shows very
promising performance on both unconstrained and constrained test problems.

commonly observed in films grown by pulsed laser deposition and reactive radio

derived infall rate ($8\times 10^{-5}\,M_\odot$ year$^{-1}$) and timescale

largely interrupt the gas structure or the infall motion towards the center.
MMS-7 thus provides an example of filamentary infall into an individual

guaranteeing the waterfall performance. The proposed decoder diversity is
achieved by training a recurrent quantized neural network (RQNN) to

As RQNNs can model a broad class of FAIDs, they are capable of learning an

the training sets are constructed by sampling from the set of most problematic
error patterns - trapping sets. In contrast to the existing methods that use
the cross-entropy function as the loss function, we introduce a
frame-error-rate (FER) based loss function to train the RQNN with the objective
of correcting specific error patterns rather than reducing the bit error rate

diversity increases the error correction capability of LDPC codes and lowers

that the theory can be simplified greatly by separating the two photon

a description of the role of entanglement in the TPA process by a
one-dimensional coherence in the Hilbert space defined by the arrival time
difference of the two photons. Transformation into the frequency difference
basis results in Kramers-Kronig relations for the TPA process, separating
off-resonant contributions of virtual levels from resonant contributions. In
particular, it can be shown that off-resonant contributions are insensitive to
the frequencies of the associated virtual states, indicating that virtual-state
spectroscopy of levels above the final two photon excited state is not

increase the effectiveness of kernel weight updates. The two datasets selected

efficient tensor network contraction algorithm for the computing partition
function of RBM and DBM. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm is much more accurate than the state-of-the-art machine
learning methods in estimating the partition function of restricted Boltzmann
machines and deep Boltzmann machines, and have potential applications in
training deep Boltzmann machines for general machine learning tasks.

can significantly improve traffic safety. Existing approaches often model
pedestrian behaviors using trajectories or poses but do not offer a deeper
semantic interpretation of a person's actions or how actions influence a
pedestrian's intention to cross in the future. In this work, we follow the
neuroscience and psychological literature to define pedestrian crossing
behavior as a combination of an unobserved inner will (a probabilistic
representation of binary intent of crossing vs. not crossing) and a set of
multi-class actions (e.g., walking, standing, etc.). Intent generates actions,
and the future actions in turn reflect the intent. We present a novel
multi-task network that predicts future pedestrian actions and uses predicted
future action as a prior to detect the present intent and action of the
pedestrian. We also designed an attention relation network to incorporate
external environmental contexts thus further improve intent and action
detection performance. We evaluated our approach on two naturalistic driving
datasets, PIE and JAAD, and extensive experiments show significantly improved
and more explainable results for both intent detection and action prediction

in nonparametric regression estimation. However, this technique has two
remarkable drawbacks: (i) the large variability of the selected bandwidths, and
(ii) the inability to provide results in a reasonable time for very large
sample sizes. To overcome these problems, bagging cross-validation bandwidths
are analyzed in this paper. This approach consists in computing the
cross-validation bandwidths for a finite number of subsamples and then
rescaling the averaged smoothing parameters to the original sample size. Under
a random-design regression model, asymptotic expressions up to a second-order
for the bias and variance of the leave-one-out cross-validation bandwidth for
the Nadaraya--Watson estimator are obtained. Subsequently, the asymptotic bias
and variance and the limit distribution are derived for the bagged
cross-validation selector. Suitable choices of the number of subsamples and the
subsample size lead to an $n^{-1/2}$ rate for the convergence in distribution
of the bagging cross-validation selector, outperforming the rate $n^{-3/10}$ of
leave-one-out cross-validation. Several simulations and an illustration on a
real dataset related to the COVID-19 pandemic show the behavior of our proposal
and its better performance, in terms of statistical efficiency and computing

Firstly, given that each user has a requirement on the number of space-time

unfulfilled user requirements, so that the space-time resources can be utilized
most efficiently and meanwhile all strong interferences are avoided. A
near-optimal scheduling algorithm is proposed with performance close to the

user scheduling and power allocation problem to minimize the power consumption

scheduling, an energy-efficient joint scheduling and power allocation scheme is
designed with limited channel state information, which outperforms the existing
independent set based schemes, and has near-optimal performance as well.

applications in datacenters. Meanwhile, high-level synthesis (HLS) tools have
been proposed to ease the programming of FPGAs. Even with HLS, irregular
data-intensive applications require explicit optimizations, among which
multiple processing elements (PEs) with each owning a private BRAM-based buffer
are usually adopted to process multiple data per cycle. Data routing, which
dynamically dispatches multiple data to designated PEs, avoids data replication
in buffers compared to statically assigning data to PEs, hence saving BRAM
usage. However, the workload imbalance among PEs vastly diminishes performance
when processing skew datasets. In this paper, we propose a skew-oblivious data
routing architecture that allocates secondary PEs and schedules them to share
the workload of the overloaded PEs at run-time. In addition, we integrate the
proposed architecture into a framework called Ditto to minimize the development
efforts for applications that require skew handling. We evaluate Ditto on five
commonly used applications: histogram building, data partitioning, pagerank,
heavy hitter detection and hyperloglog. The results demonstrate that the
generated implementations are robust to skew datasets and outperform the
stateof-the-art designs in both throughput and BRAM usage efficiency.

  Clustered Model Updates","To appear in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging decentralized learning framework
through which multiple clients can collaboratively train a learning model.
However, a major obstacle that impedes the wide deployment of FL lies in
massive communication traffic. To train high dimensional machine learning
models (such as CNN models), heavy communication traffic can be incurred by
exchanging model updates via the Internet between clients and the parameter
server (PS), implying that the network resource can be easily exhausted.
Compressing model updates is an effective way to reduce the traffic amount.
However, a flexible unbiased compression algorithm applicable for both uplink
and downlink compression in FL is still absent from existing works. In this
work, we devise the Model Update Compression by Soft Clustering (MUCSC)
algorithm to compress model updates transmitted between clients and the PS. In
MUCSC, it is only necessary to transmit cluster centroids and the cluster ID of
each model update. Moreover, we prove that: 1) The compressed model updates are
unbiased estimation of their original values so that the convergence rate by
transmitting compressed model updates is unchanged; 2) MUCSC can guarantee that
the influence of the compression error on the model accuracy is minimized.
Then, we further propose the boosted MUCSC (B-MUCSC) algorithm, a biased
compression algorithm that can achieve an extremely high compression rate by
grouping insignificant model updates into a super cluster. B-MUCSC is suitable
for scenarios with very scarce network resource. Ultimately, we conduct
extensive experiments with the CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets to demonstrate
that our algorithms can not only substantially reduce the volume of
communication traffic in FL, but also improve the training efficiency in
practical networks.

usually obtained. To obtain a more detailed mechanical picture of the fibre, it
is crucial to determine mechanical properties in depth. To this end, we discuss
an atomic force microscopy-based approach to examine the local stiffness as a
function of indentation depth via static force-distance curves. This method has
been applied to linter fibres (extracted from a finished paper sheet) as well
as to natural raw cotton fibres to better understand the influence of the pulp
treatment process in paper production on the mechanical properties. Both types
of fibres were characterised in dry and wet conditions with respect to
alterations in their mechanical properties. Subsurface imaging revealed which
wall in the fibre structure protects the fibre against mechanical loading. Via
a combined 3D display, a spatially resolved mechanical map of the fibre
interior near the surface can be established. Additionally, we labelled fibres

build personalization model. However, the collected data is observational
rather than experimental, causing various biases in the data which
significantly affect the learned model. Most existing work for recommendation
debiasing, such as the inverse propensity scoring and imputation approaches,
focuses on one or two specific biases, lacking the universal capacity that can
account for mixed or even unknown biases in the data. Towards this research
gap, we first analyze the origin of biases from the perspective of \textit{risk
discrepancy} that represents the difference between the expectation empirical
risk and the true risk. Remarkably, we derive a general learning framework that
well summarizes most existing debiasing strategies by specifying some
parameters of the general framework. This provides a valuable opportunity to
develop a universal solution for debiasing, e.g., by learning the debiasing
parameters from data. However, the training data lacks important signal of how
the data is biased and what the unbiased data looks like. To move this idea
forward, we propose \textit{AotoDebias} that leverages another (small) set of
uniform data to optimize the debiasing parameters by solving the bi-level
optimization problem with meta-learning. Through theoretical analyses, we
derive the generalization bound for AutoDebias and prove its ability to acquire
the appropriate debiasing strategy. Extensive experiments on two real datasets
and a simulated dataset demonstrated effectiveness of AutoDebias. The code is

uncorrelated, but absolute log-returns or their squares namely the fluctuating
volatility are correlated and is characterized by heavy tailed in the sense
that some moment of the absolute log-returns is infinite and typically
non-Gaussian [20]. And this last characteristic change accordantly to different
timescales. We propose to model this long-memory phenomenon by superstatistical
dynamics and provide a Bayesian Inference methodology drawing on
Metropolis-Hasting random walk sampling to determine which superstatistics
among inverse-Gamma and log-Normal describe the best log-returns complexity on
different timescales, from high to low frequency. We show that on smaller
timescales (minutes) even though the Inverse-Gamma superstatistics works the
best, the log-Normal model remains very reliable and suitable to fit the
absolute log-returns probability density distribution with strong capacity of
describing heavy tails and power law decays. On larger timescales (daily), we
show in terms of Bayes factor that the inverse-Gamma superstatistics is
preferred to the log-Normal model. We also show evidence of a transition of
statistics from power law decay on small timescales to exponential decay on
large scale with less heavy tails meaning that on larger time scales the
fluctuating volatility tend to be memoryless, consequently superstatistics
becomes less relevant.

Risk (MER) is defined as the difference between the minimum expected loss
achievable when learning from data and the minimum expected loss that could be
achieved if $W$ was observed. In this paper, we build upon and extend the
recent results of (Xu & Raginsky, 2020) to analyze the MER in Bayesian learning
and derive information-theoretic bounds on it. We formulate the problem as a
(constrained) rate-distortion optimization and show how the solution can be
bounded above and below by two other rate-distortion functions that are easier
to study. The lower bound represents the minimum possible excess risk
achievable by any process using $R$ bits of information from the parameter $W$.
For the upper bound, the optimization is further constrained to use $R$ bits
from the training set, a setting which relates MER to information-theoretic
bounds on the generalization gap in frequentist learning. We derive
information-theoretic bounds on the difference between these upper and lower
bounds and show that they can provide order-wise tight rates for MER under
certain conditions. This analysis gives more insight into the
information-theoretic nature of Bayesian learning as well as providing novel

learning compact deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite the promising results
achieved, the rationale that interprets the behavior of KD has yet remained
largely understudied. In this paper, we introduce a novel task-oriented
attention model, termed as KDExplainer, to shed light on the working mechanism
underlying the vanilla KD. At the heart of KDExplainer is a Hierarchical
Mixture of Experts (HME), in which a multi-class classification is reformulated
as a multi-task binary one. Through distilling knowledge from a free-form
pre-trained DNN to KDExplainer, we observe that KD implicitly modulates the
knowledge conflicts between different subtasks, and in reality has much more to
offer than label smoothing. Based on such findings, we further introduce a
portable tool, dubbed as virtual attention module (VAM), that can be seamlessly
integrated with various DNNs to enhance their performance under KD.
Experimental results demonstrate that with a negligible additional cost,
student models equipped with VAM consistently outperform their non-VAM
counterparts across different benchmarks. Furthermore, when combined with other
KD methods, VAM remains competent in promoting results, even though it is only
motivated by vanilla KD. The code is available at

preference prediction (such as the collaborative filtering-based ones), often
face dramatic performance degradation when the interactions of users or items

explored to alleviate this problem. Among them, knowledge graph (KG) has
attracted extensive research interests as it can encode users/items and their
associated attributes in the graph structure to preserve the relation
information. In contrast, less attention has been paid to the item-item
co-occurrence information (i.e., \textit{co-view}), which contains rich
item-item similarity information. It provides information from a perspective
different from the user/item-attribute graph and is also valuable for the CF
recommendation models. In this work, we make an effort to study the potential
of integrating both types of side information (i.e., KG and item-item
co-occurrence data) for recommendation. To achieve the goal, we propose a
unified graph-based recommendation model (UGRec), which integrates the
traditional directed relations in KG and the undirected item-item co-occurrence
relations simultaneously. In particular, for a directed relation, we transform
the head and tail entities into the corresponding relation space to model their
relation; and for an undirected co-occurrence relation, we project head and
tail entities into a unique hyperplane in the entity space to minimize their
distance. In addition, a head-tail relation-aware attentive mechanism is
designed for fine-grained relation modeling. Extensive experiments have been
conducted on several publicly accessible datasets to evaluate the proposed
model. Results show that our model outperforms several previous
state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of our UGRec model.

relevancy, which accounts for feature interactions such as redundant and

introduced only recently by the partial information decomposition (PID)

definition, we show that the conditional mutual information (CMI) maximizes
relevancy while minimizing redundancy and propose an iterative, CMI-based

Here, we present and analyse a comprehensive and efficient approach to compute
the intrinsic, phonon-limited drift and Hall carrier mobilities of
semiconductors, within the framework of the first-principles Boltzmann
transport equation. The methodology exploits a novel approach for estimating
quadrupole tensors and including them in the electron-phonon interactions, and
capitalises on a rigorous and efficient procedure for numerical convergence.
The accuracy reached in this work allows to assess common approximations,
including the role of exchange and correlation functionals, spin-orbit
coupling, pseudopotentials, Wannier interpolation, Brillouin-zone sampling,
dipole and quadrupole corrections, and the relaxation-time approximation. A
detailed analysis is showcased on ten prototypical semiconductors, namely
diamond, silicon, GaAs, 3C-SiC, AlP, GaP, c-BN, AlAs, AlSb, and SrO. By
comparing this extensive dataset with available experimental data, we explore
the intrinsic nature of phonon-limited carrier transport and magnetotransport
phenomena in these compounds. We find that the most accurate calculations
predict Hall mobilities up to a factor of two larger than experimental data;
this could point to promising experimental improvements in the samples quality,
or to the limitations of density-function theory in predicting the carrier
effective masses and overscreening the electron-phonon matrix elements. By
setting tight standards for reliability and reproducibility, the present work

computational imaging approach to the HDR tomography problem, we here suggest a
new model based on the Modulo Radon Transform (MRT), which we rigorously

This ensures that the HDR measurements are folded into a lower dynamic range.
On the algorithmic front, our recovery algorithms reconstruct the HDR images

folding tomographic measurements available as an open source data set using our

followers while ensuring timely delivery of safety-critical messages to the

centralized resource management schemes that require global information are
inefficient and lead to large signaling overheads. Hence, we exploit a
distributed resource allocation framework based on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), where each platoon leader (PL) acts as an agent and interacts
with the environment to learn its optimal policy. Existing MARL algorithms
consider a holistic reward function for the group's collective success, which
often ends up with unsatisfactory results and cannot guarantee an optimal
policy for each agent. Consequently, motivated by the existing literature in
RL, we propose a novel MARL framework that trains two critics with the
following goals: A global critic which estimates the global expected reward and
motivates the agents toward a cooperating behavior and an exclusive local
critic for each agent that estimates the local individual reward. Furthermore,
based on the tasks each agent has to accomplish, the individual reward of each
agent is decomposed into multiple sub-reward functions where task-wise value
functions are learned separately. Numerical results indicate our proposed
algorithm's effectiveness compared with the conventional RL methods applied in

Gaussian distributions and the other one has no prior distributional

confined to the near field of nanostructures, they cannot be excited using
propagating light. As a result, their direct experimental observation has been
elusive. Rather than using light, we demonstrate probing BIC modes on arrays of
silicon nanoantennas using a focused beam of electrons in a tranmission

than previously implied, and the X-ray flux period is 65.21+/- 0.15 d, which is
slightly shorter than previously measured. The physical origin of these
different flux periods is currently unknown. We study the hardness ratio to
search for indications of spectral changes. We find that the hardness ratios at
high energies are very stable and not directly correlated with the observed
flux. At lower energies we observe a small hardening with increased flux, which
might indicate increased obscuration through outflows at higher luminosities.
We find that the pulsed fraction is significantly higher at low fluxes. This
seems to imply that the accretion geometry already changed before the source
entered the deep off-state. We discuss possible scenarios to explain this
behavior, which is likely driven by a precessing accretion disk.

This causes challenges for using the network by a multi-agent system to solve a
distributed optimisation problem. Distributed optimisation schemes, however,
typically do not assume network models that are representative for real-world
communication networks, since communication links are most of the time
abstracted as lossless. Our objective is therefore to formulate a
representative network model and provide practically verifiable network
conditions that ensure convergence of distributed algorithms in the presence of
interference and possibly unbounded delay. Our network is modelled by a
sequence of directed-graphs, where to each network link we associate a process
for the instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. We then
formulate practical conditions that can be verified locally and show that the
age of information (AoI) associated with data communicated over the network is
in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$. Under these conditions we show that a penalty-based
gradient descent algorithm can be used to solve a rich class of stochastic,
constrained, distributed optimisation problems. The strength of our result lies
in the bridge between practical verifiable network conditions and an abstract
optimisation theory. We illustrate numerically that our algorithm converges in
an extreme scenario where the average AoI diverges.

parameterize the mapping from a set of lamination parameters on a coarse mesh

problems associated with traditional de-homogenization approaches and save time
correspondingly. To train the neural network, a two-step custom loss function
has been developed which ensures a periodic output field that follows the local
lamination orientations. A key feature of the proposed method is that the
training is carried out without any use of or reference to the underlying
structural optimization problem, which renders the proposed method robust and
insensitive wrt. domain size, boundary conditions, and loading. A
post-processing procedure utilizing a distance transform on the output field
skeleton is used to project the desired lamination widths onto the output field
while ensuring a predefined minimum length-scale and volume fraction. To
demonstrate that the deep learning approach has excellent generalization
properties, numerical examples are shown for several different load and
boundary conditions. For an appropriate choice of parameters, the
de-homogenized designs perform within $7-25\%$ of the homogenization-based

further improvements, the scheme may provide the basis for future interactive

theories behind them. Our goal is to give a rigorous introduction to the
readers with prior exposure to ordinary least squares. In machine learning, the
output is usually a nonlinear function of the input. Deep learning even aims to
find a nonlinear dependence with many layers which require a large amount of
computation. However, most of these algorithms build upon simple linear models.
We then describe linear models from different views and find the properties and
theories behind the models. The linear model is the main technique in
regression problems and the primary tool for it is the least squares
approximation which minimizes a sum of squared errors. This is a natural choice
when we're interested in finding the regression function which minimizes the
corresponding expected squared error. This survey is primarily a summary of
purpose, significance of important theories behind linear models, e.g.,
distribution theory, minimum variance estimator. We first describe ordinary
least squares from three different points of view upon which we disturb the
model with random noise and Gaussian noise. By Gaussian noise, the model gives
rise to the likelihood so that we introduce a maximum likelihood estimator. It
also develops some distribution theories via this Gaussian disturbance. The
distribution theory of least squares will help us answer various questions and
introduce related applications. We then prove least squares is the best
unbiased linear model in the sense of mean squared error and most importantly,
it actually approaches the theoretical limit. We end up with linear models with
the Bayesian approach and beyond.

each modality embeddings stem from non-related feature spaces, which causes the
notorious 'heterogeneity gap'. Currently, many cross-modal systems try to
bridge the gap with self-attention. However, self-attention has been widely
criticized for its quadratic complexity, which prevents many real-life
applications. In response to this, we propose T-EMDE - a neural density
estimator inspired by the recently introduced Efficient Manifold Density
Estimator (EMDE) from the area of recommender systems. EMDE operates on
sketches - representations especially suitable for multimodal operations.
However, EMDE is non-differentiable and ingests precomputed, static embeddings.
With T-EMDE we introduce a trainable version of EMDE which allows full
end-to-end training. In contrast to self-attention, the complexity of our
solution is linear to the number of tokens/segments. As such, T-EMDE is a
drop-in replacement for the self-attention module, with beneficial influence on
both speed and metric performance in cross-modal settings. It facilitates
communication between modalities, as each global text/image representation is
expressed with a standardized sketch histogram which represents the same
manifold structures irrespective of the underlying modality. We evaluate T-EMDE

However, effective gradient quantization is still an open problem. Gradients
are unbounded and their distribution changes significantly during training,
which leads to the need for dynamic quantization. As we show, dynamic
quantization can lead to significant memory overhead and additional data
traffic slowing down training. We propose a simple alternative to dynamic
quantization, in-hindsight range estimation, that uses the quantization ranges
estimated on previous iterations to quantize the present. Our approach enables
fast static quantization of gradients and activations while requiring only
minimal hardware support from the neural network accelerator to keep track of

making aim to equalize ``total'' error rates for different subgroups in the
population. In contrast, we argue that the fairness approaches should instead
focus only on equalizing errors arising due to model uncertainty (a.k.a
epistemic uncertainty), caused due to lack of knowledge about the best model or
due to lack of data. In other words, our proposal calls for ignoring the errors
that occur due to uncertainty inherent in the data, i.e., aleatoric
uncertainty. We draw a connection between predictive multiplicity and model
uncertainty and argue that the techniques from predictive multiplicity could be
used to identify errors made due to model uncertainty. We propose scalable
convex proxies to come up with classifiers that exhibit predictive multiplicity
and empirically show that our methods are comparable in performance and up to
four orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art. We further
propose methods to achieve our goal of equalizing group error rates arising due
to model uncertainty in algorithmic decision making and demonstrate the
effectiveness of these methods using synthetic and real-world datasets.

  Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Width-based planning methods deal with conjunctive goals by decomposing
problems into subproblems of low width. Algorithms like SIW thus fail when the
goal is not easily serializable in this way or when some of the subproblems
have a high width. In this work, we address these limitations by using a simple
but powerful language for expressing finer problem decompositions introduced
recently by Bonet and Geffner, called policy sketches. A policy sketch over a
set of Boolean and numerical features is a set of sketch rules that express how
the values of these features are supposed to change. Like general policies,
policy sketches are domain general, but unlike policies, the changes captured
by sketch rules do not need to be achieved in a single step. We show that many
planning domains that cannot be solved by SIW are provably solvable in low
polynomial time with the SIW_R algorithm, the version of SIW that employs
user-provided policy sketches. Policy sketches are thus shown to be a powerful
language for expressing domain-specific knowledge in a simple and compact way
and a convenient alternative to languages such as HTNs or temporal logics.
Furthermore, they make it easy to express general problem decompositions and
prove key properties of them like their width and complexity.

used in vertical search systems, offering users meaningful facets to refine
their search query and narrow down the results quickly to find the intended
search target. This work focuses on the problem of ranking type-based facets.
In a structured information space, type-based facets (t-facets) indicate the
category to which each object belongs. When they belong to a large multi-level
taxonomy, it is desirable to rank them separately before ranking other facet
groups. This helps the searcher in filtering the results according to their
type first. This also makes it easier to rank the rest of the facets once the
type of the intended search target is selected. Existing research employs the
same ranking methods for different facet groups. In this research, we propose a
two-step approach to personalize t-facet ranking. The first step assigns a
relevance score to each individual leaf-node t-facet. The score is generated
using probabilistic models and it reflects t-facet relevance to the query and
the user profile. In the second step, this score is used to re-order and select
the sub-tree to present to the user. We investigate the usefulness of the
proposed method to a Point Of Interest (POI) suggestion task. Our evaluation
aims at capturing the user effort required to fulfil her search needs by using
the ranked facets. The proposed approach achieved better results than other

retrieved particle effective radii of $\log_{10} a {\rm (\mu m)} =

${\rm (Mg/Si)} = 0.69^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ if there are no other sinks for
magnesium or silicon. Models that include forsterite alongside, or in place of,
these cloud species are strongly rejected in favour of the above combination.

than predicted by evolutionary models for a field age object with the

novel weakly supervised multi-instance learning approach that deciphers
quantitative slide-level annotations which are fast to obtain and regularly

approach achieves superior performance in out-of-distribution, out-of-location,

  nanocluster",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aberration-corrected scanning electron microscopy (AC-STEM) can provide
valuable information on the atomic structure of nanoclusters, an essential
input for gaining an understanding of their physical and chemical properties. A
systematic method is presented here for the extraction of atom coordinates from
an AC-STEM image in a way that is general enough to be applicable to irregular
structures. The two-dimensional information from the image is complemented with
an approximate description of the atomic interactions so as to construct a
three-dimensional structure and, at a final stage, the structure is refined
using electron density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The method is
applied to an AC-STEM image of Au55. Analysis of the local structure shows that
the cluster is a combination of a part with icosahedral structure elements and
a part with local atomic arrangement characteristic of crystal packing,
including a segment of a flat surface facet. The energy landscape of the
cluster is explored in calculations of minimum energy paths between the optimal
fit structure and other candidates generated in the analysis. This reveals low
energy barriers for conformational changes, showing that such transitions can
occur on laboratory timescale even at room temperature and lead to large
changes in the AC-STEM image. The paths furthermore reveal additional cluster
configurations, some with lower DFT energy and providing nearly as good fit to
the experimental image.

language processing (PLP). Recent works that learn representations of code
based on pre-training techniques in NLP have pushed the frontiers in this
direction. However, the semantics of PL and NL have essential differences.
These being ignored, we believe it is difficult to build a model to better
understand programs, by either directly applying off-the-shelf NLP pre-training
techniques to the source code, or adding features to the model by the
heuristic. In fact, the semantics of a program can be rigorously defined by
formal semantics in PL theory. For example, the operational semantics,
describes the meaning of a valid program as updating the environment (i.e., the
memory address-value function) through fundamental operations, such as memory
I/O and conditional branching. Inspired by this, we propose a novel program
semantics learning paradigm, that the model should learn from information
composed of (1) the representations which align well with the fundamental
operations in operational semantics, and (2) the information of environment
transition, which is indispensable for program understanding. To validate our
proposal, we present a hierarchical Transformer-based pre-training model called
OSCAR to better facilitate the understanding of programs. OSCAR learns from
intermediate representation (IR) and an encoded representation derived from
static analysis, which are used for representing the fundamental operations and
approximating the environment transitions respectively. OSCAR empirically shows
the outstanding capability of program semantics understanding on many practical
software engineering tasks.

foreshock occurrence prior to natural earthquakes, making thus difficult to
track how earthquakes start. Here, we report on three stick-slip experiments
performed on cylindrical samples of Indian metagabbro under upper crustal
stress conditions (30-60 $MPa$). Acoustic emissions (AEs) were continuously
recorded by 8 calibrated acoustic sensors during the experiments. Seismological
parameters (moment magnitude, corner frequency and stress-drop) of the detected
AEs ($-8.8 \leq Mw \leq -7 $) follow the scaling law between moment magnitude
and corner frequency that characterizes natural earthquakes. AE activity always
increases towards failure and is found to be driven by along fault slip
velocity. Consistently for all three experiments, the stacked AE foreshock
sequences follow an inverse power-law of the time to failure (inverse Omori),
with a characteristic Omori time $c$ inversely proportional to normal stress.
AEs moment magnitudes increase towards failure, as manifested by a decrease in
b-value from $\sim 1$ to $\sim 0.5$ at the end of the nucleation process.
During nucleation, the averaged distance of foreshocks to mainshock also
continuously decreases, highlighting the fast migration of foreshocks towards
the mainshock epicenter location, and stabilizing at a distance from the latter
compatible with the predicted Rate-and-State nucleation size. Importantly, we
also show that the nucleation characteristic timescale scales inversely with
applied normal stress and the expected nucleation size. Finally, the seismic
component of the nucleation phase is orders of magnitude smaller than that of
its aseismic component, which suggests that, in this experimental setting at
least, foreshocks are the byproducts of a process almost fully aseismic.

pinning down an exact coherent error model for graph states generated from

events. To this task, methods based on reconstruction and prediction are wildly
used in recent works, which are built on the assumption that learning on normal
data, anomalies cannot be reconstructed or predicated as good as normal
patterns, namely the anomaly result with more errors. In this paper, we propose
to discriminate anomalies from normal ones by the duality of normality-granted
optical flow, which is conducive to predict normal frames but adverse to
abnormal frames. The normality-granted optical flow is predicted from a single
frame, to keep the motion knowledge focused on normal patterns. Meanwhile, We
extend the appearance-motion correspondence scheme from frame reconstruction to
prediction, which not only helps to learn the knowledge about object
appearances and correlated motion, but also meets the fact that motion is the
transformation between appearances. We also introduce a margin loss to enhance
the learning of frame prediction. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets
demonstrate the impressive performance of our approach.

different areas ranging from biology via epidemics to economics and
engineering. Unexpected behaviour of dynamic systems or even system failure is
sometimes difficult to comprehend. Such a data-mismatch can be caused by
endogenous model errors including misspecified interactions and inaccurate
parameter values. These are often difficult to distinguish from unmodelled
process influencing the real system like unknown inputs or faults. Localizing
the root cause of these errors or faults and reconstructing their dynamics is
only possible if the measured outputs of the system are sufficiently
informative.
  Here, we present criteria for the measurements required to localize the
position of error sources in large dynamic networks. We assume that faults or
errors occur at a limited number of positions in the network. This invariable
sparsity differs from previous sparsity definitions for inputs to dynamic
systems. We provide an exact criterion for the recovery of invariable sparse
inputs to nonlinear systems and formulate an optimization criterion for
invariable sparse input reconstruction. For linear systems we can provide exact
error bounds for this reconstruction method.

of interest (KOI) with significant transit timing variations (TTV). For KOIs
with high enough SNRs, HM+16 also derived the duration and depth of their

systematically study the duration changes of 561 KOIs and identify 15 KOIs with
a significant long-term linear change of transit durations and another 16 KOIs
with an intermediate significance. We show that the observed linear trend is
probably caused by a precession of the orbital plane of the transiting planet,
induced in most cases by another planet. The leading term of the precession
rate depends on the mass and relative inclination of the perturber, and the
period ratio between the two orbits, but not on the mass and period of the
transiting planet itself. Interestingly, our findings indicate that, as a
sample, the detected time derivatives of the durations get larger as a function
of the planetary orbital period, probably because short-period planetary
systems display small relative inclinations. The results might indicate that
short-period planets reside in relatively flattened planetary systems,
suggesting these systems experienced stronger dissipation either when formed or
when migrated to short orbits. This should be used as a possible clue for the
formation of such systems.

two subtasks, detection and re-identification (ReID). In order to enhance the
inference speed and reduce the complexity, current methods commonly integrate
these double subtasks into a unified framework. Nevertheless, detection and
ReID demand diverse features. This issue would result in an optimization
contradiction during the training procedure. With the target of alleviating
this contradiction, we devise a module named Global Context Disentangling (GCD)
that decouples the learned representation into detection-specific and
ReID-specific embeddings. As such, this module provides an implicit manner to
balance the different requirements of these two subtasks. Moreover, we observe
that preceding MOT methods typically leverage local information to associate
the detected targets and neglect to consider the global semantic relation. To
resolve this restriction, we develop a module, referred to as Guided
Transformer Encoder (GTE), by combining the powerful reasoning ability of
Transformer encoder and deformable attention. Unlike previous works, GTE avoids
analyzing all the pixels and only attends to capture the relation between query
nodes and a few self-adaptively selected key samples. Therefore, it is
computationally efficient. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the
MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed MOT framework, namely RelationTrack. The experimental results indicate
that RelationTrack has surpassed preceding methods significantly and
established a new state-of-the-art performance, e.g., IDF1 of 70.5% and MOTA of

gamma rays from the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) dwarf irregular galaxy. The
pair annihilation of dark matter particles would produce Standard Model
particles in the final state such as gamma rays, which might be detected by
ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. Dwarf irregular galaxies represent promising
targets as they are dark matter dominated objects with well measured kinematics
and small uncertainties on their dark matter distribution profiles. In 2018,
the H.E.S.S. five-telescope array observed the dwarf irregular galaxy WLM for
18 hours. We present the first analysis based on data obtained from an imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescope for this subclass of dwarf galaxy. As we do not
observe any significant excess in the direction of WLM, we interpret the result
in terms of constraints on the velocity-weighted cross section for dark matter
pair annihilation as a function of the dark matter particle mass for various
continuum channels as well as the prompt gamma-gamma emission. For the
$\tau^+\tau^-$ channel the limits reach a $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ value of
about $4\times 10^{-22}$ cm3s-1 for a dark matter particle mass of 1 TeV. For
the prompt gamma-gamma channel, the upper limit reaches a $\langle \sigma v
\rangle$ value of about $5 \times10^{-24}$ cm3s-1 for a mass of 370 GeV. These
limits represent an improvement of up to a factor 200 with respect to previous
results for the dwarf irregular galaxies for TeV dark matter search.

methods. Nevertheless, the traditional Tchebycheff function does not consider
the matching relationship between the weight vectors and candidate solutions.
In this paper, the concept of matching degree is proposed which employs
vectorial angles between weight vectors and candidate solutions. Based on the
matching degree, a new modified Tchebycheff aggregation function is proposed,
which integrates matching degree into the Tchebycheff aggregation function.
Moreover, the proposed decomposition method has the same functionality with the
Tchebycheff aggregation function. Based on the proposed decomposition approach,
a new multiobjective optimization algorithm named decomposition-based
multi-objective state transition algorithm is proposed. Relevant experimental
results show that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive in comparison
with other state-of-the-art multiobjetive optimization algorithms.

the global optimum of expensive, black-box functions. The current practical BO
algorithms have regret bounds ranging from $\mathcal{O}(\frac{logN}{\sqrt{N}})$

paper explores the possibility of improving the regret bound in the noiseless

which are based on partitioning the search space. We propose the BOO algorithm,
a first practical approach which can achieve an exponential regret bound with
order $\mathcal O(N^{-\sqrt{N}})$ under the assumption that the objective
function is sampled from a Gaussian process with a Mat\'ern kernel with
smoothness parameter $\nu > 4 +\frac{D}{2}$, where $D$ is the number of

of $n$ participants if only $2n/3$ or less of them are correct. As blockchains
need to solve consensus, one might think that blockchains need more than $2n/3$
correct participants. But it is yet unknown whether consensus can be solved
when less than $2n/3$ participants are correct and $k$ participants are
rational players, which misbehave if they can gain the loot. Trading correct
participants for rational players may not seem helpful to solve consensus since
rational players can misbehave whereas correct participants, by definition,
cannot.
  In this paper, we show that consensus is actually solvable in this model,
even with less than $2n/3$ correct participants. The key idea is a baiting
strategy that lets rational players pretend to misbehave in joining a coalition
but rewards them to betray this coalition before the loot gets stolen. We
propose TRAP, a protocol that builds upon recent advances in the theory of
accountability to solve consensus as soon as
$n>\max\bigl(\frac{3}{2}k+3t,2(k+t)\bigr)$: by assuming that private keys
cannot be forged, this protocol is an equilibrium where no coalition of $k$
rational players can coordinate to increase their expected utility regardless
of the arbitrary behavior of up to $t$ Byzantine players.
  Finally, we show that a baiting strategy is necessary and sufficient to solve
this, so-called rational agreement problem. First, we show that it is
impossible to solve this rational agreement problem without implementing a
baiting strategy. Second, the existence of TRAP demonstrates the sufficiency of
the baiting strategy. Our TRAP protocol finds applications in blockchains to
prevent players from disagreeing, that could otherwise lead to ""double
spending"".

challenges. First, the solution forms shocks leading to oscillatory behaviour
in the numerical approximation of the solution. Second, the number of unknowns
required for an effective discretization of the solution grows exponentially
with the dimension of the uncertainties, yielding high computational costs and
large memory requirements. An efficient representation of the solution via
adequate basis functions permits to tackle these difficulties. The generalized
polynomial chaos (gPC) polynomials allow such an efficient representation when
the distribution of the uncertainties is known. These distributions are usually
only available for input uncertainties such as initial conditions, therefore
the efficiency of this ansatz can get lost during runtime. In this paper, we
make use of the dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) to obtain a memory-wise
efficient solution approximation on a lower dimensional manifold. We
investigate the use of the matrix projector-splitting integrator and the
unconventional integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, deriving
separate time evolution equations for the spatial and uncertain basis
functions, respectively. This guarantees an efficient approximation of the
solution even if the underlying probability distributions change over time.
Furthermore, filters to mitigate the appearance of spurious oscillations are
implemented, and a strategy to enforce boundary conditions is introduced. The
proposed methodology is analyzed for Burgers' equation equipped with uncertain
initial values represented by a two-dimensional random vector. The numerical
results show a reduction of the memory requirements, and that the important

$p$ is a map from $V$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$. The length of an edge $uv\in E$ in
$(G,p)$ is the distance between $p(u)$ and $p(v)$. The framework is said to be
globally rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ if the graph $G$ and its edge lengths uniquely
determine $(G,p)$, up to congruence. A graph $G$ is called globally rigid in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ if every $d$-dimensional generic framework $(G,p)$ is globally
rigid.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of reconstructing a graph from the set
of edge lengths arising from a generic framework. Roughly speaking, a graph $G$
is strongly reconstructible in $\mathbb{C}^d$ if the set of (unlabeled) edge
lengths of any generic framework $(G,p)$ in $d$-space, along with the number of
vertices of $G$, uniquely determine both $G$ and the association between the
edges of $G$ and the set of edge lengths. It is known that if $G$ is globally
rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ on at least $d+2$ vertices, then it is strongly
reconstructible in $\mathbb{C}^d$. We strengthen this result and show that
under the same conditions, $G$ is in fact fully reconstructible in
$\mathbb{C}^d$, which means that the set of edge lengths alone is sufficient to
uniquely reconstruct $G$, without any constraint on the number of vertices
(although still under the assumption that the edge lengths come from a generic
realization).
  As a key step in our proof, we also prove that if $G$ is globally rigid in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ on at least $d+2$ vertices, then the $d$-dimensional generic
rigidity matroid of $G$ is connected. Finally, we provide new families of fully
reconstructible graphs and use them to answer some questions regarding
unlabeled reconstructibility posed in recent papers.

  In this paper, we focus on the number of rational places of the

$\mathbb{F}_q$ of characteristic $p$, where $f(x)$ is a polynomial in

first show that the function field $E_f:=\mathbb{F}_q(x,y)$ of the
Artin-Schreier curve $y^p-y=f(x)$ is a subfield of some cyclotomic function
field. We then make use of the class field theory to prove that the number of
points of the curve is upper bounded by a function of a minimum distance of a
linear code. By analyzing the minimum distance of this linear code, we can
improve the Hasse-Weil bound and Serre bound for Artin-Schreier curves.

generated by the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. It is typically
assumed that after production, DM abundance freezes and remains constant.
However, thermalization and number-changing processes in the dark sector can
have a strong impact, in particular enhancing the DM population by several
orders of magnitude. Here we review the impact of self-interactions from
general arguments such as the conservation of energy and entropy, independently
from the underlying particle physics details of the dark sector. Additionally,
we study the interplay with other purely gravitational DM production
mechanisms, such as the scattering of standard model states or inflatons,

allocating spectrum to a user then depends on the message's urgency. We assume

this context. However, these surrogate models tend to be relatively inflexible,
and often provide a poor approximation to the true likelihood function. In this
article, we propose the use of a warped, gradient-enhanced, Gaussian process
surrogate model for the likelihood function, which jointly models the sample
means and variances of the sufficient statistics, and uses warping functions to
capture covariance nonstationarity in the input parameter space. We show that
both the consideration of nonstationarity and the inclusion of gradient
information can be leveraged to obtain a surrogate model that outperforms the
conventional stationary Gaussian process surrogate model when making inference,
particularly in regions where the likelihood function exhibits a phase
transition. We also show that the proposed surrogate model can be used to
improve the effective sample size per unit time when embedded in exact
inferential algorithms. The utility of our approach in speeding up inferential
algorithms is demonstrated on simulated and real-world data.

""complete"" a partial set of items already known. We consider the two scenarios
of citation and subject label recommendation, which resemble different
semantics of item co-occurrence: relatedness for co-citations and diversity for
subject labels. We assess the influence of the completeness of an already known
partial item set on the recommender performance. We also investigate data
sparsity through a pruning parameter and the influence of using additional
metadata. As recommender models, we focus on different autoencoders, which are
particularly suited for reconstructing missing items in a set. We extend
autoencoders to exploit a multi-modal input of text and structured data. Our
experiments on six real-world datasets show that supplying the partial item set
as input is helpful when item co-occurrence resembles relatedness, while
metadata are effective when co-occurrence implies diversity. This outcome means
that the semantics of item co-occurrence is an important factor. The simple
item co-occurrence model is a strong baseline for citation recommendation.
However, autoencoders have the advantage to enable exploiting additional
metadata besides the partial item set as input and achieve comparable
performance. For the subject label recommendation task, the title is the most
important attribute. Adding more input modalities sometimes even harms the
result. In conclusion, it is crucial to consider the semantics of the item
co-occurrence for the choice of an appropriate recommendation model and
carefully decide which metadata to exploit.

images, have gained substantial importance over the past decades. They are used
in quality assurance applications, e.g., for finding surface defects in
products during manufacturing, surveillance, but also automated driving,
requiring reliable behavior. Interestingly, there is only little work on
quality assurance and especially testing of vision systems in general. In this
paper, we contribute to the area of testing vision software, and present a
framework for the automated generation of tests for systems based on vision and
image recognition. The framework makes use of existing libraries allowing to
modify original images and to obtain similarities between the original and
modified images. We show how such a framework can be used for testing a
particular industrial application on identifying defects on riblet surfaces and
present preliminary results from the image classification domain.

semiclassical expansion around a very specific limit. This limit was identified
long ago by Lieb and Simon for the total electronic energy of a system. This is
a universal limit of all electronic structure: atoms, molecules, and solids.
For the total energy, Thomas-Fermi theory becomes relatively exact in the
limit. The limit can also be studied for much simpler model systems, including
non-interacting fermions in a one-dimensional well, where the WKB approximation
applies for individual eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Summation techniques
lead to energies and densities that are functionals of the potential. We
consider several examples in one dimension (fermions in a box, in a harmonic
well, in a linear half-well, and in the P\""oschl-Teller well. The effects of
higher dimension are also illustrated with the three-dimensional harmonic well
and the Bohr atom, non-interacting fermions in a Coulomb well. Modern density
functional calculations use the Kohn-Sham scheme almost exclusively. The same
semiclassical limit can be studied for the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy, for the
exchange energy, and for the correlation energy. For all three, the local
density approximation appears to become relatively exact in this limit. Recent
work, both analytic and numerical, explores how this limit is approached, in an
effort to deduce the leading corrections to the local approximation. A simple
scheme, using the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, is the result of many
different attempts at this problem. In very simple cases, the correction
formulas are much more accurate than standard density functionals. Several
functionals are already in widespread use in both chemistry and materials that
incorporate these limits, and prospects for the future are discussed.

via E-matching, an SMT algorithm that requires syntactic matching patterns to
guide the quantifier instantiations. Devising good matching patterns is
challenging. In particular, overly restrictive patterns may lead to spurious
verification errors if the quantifiers needed for a proof are not instantiated;
they may also conceal unsoundness caused by inconsistent axiomatizations. In
this paper, we present the first technique that identifies and helps the users
remedy the effects of overly restrictive matching patterns. We designed a novel

Bonnor-Ebert spheres (BES) which are stabilized by an external pressure. For
the typical pressure of $10^4k_B\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$ to
$10^5k_B\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$ found in molecular clouds, cores with masses
below $1.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ are stable against gravitational collapse. In this
paper, we analyze the efficiency of triggering a gravitational collapse by a
nearby stellar wind, which represents an interesting scenario for triggered
low-mass star formation. We derive analytically a new stability criterion for a
BES compressed by a stellar wind, which depends on its initial nondimensional
radius $\xi_{max}$. If the stability limit is violated the wind triggers a core
collapse. Otherwise, the core is destroyed by the wind. We estimate its
validity range to $2.5<\xi_{max}<4.2$ and confirm this in simulations with the
SPH Code GADGET-3. The efficiency to trigger a gravitational collapse strongly
decreases for $\xi_{max}<2.5$ since in this case destruction and acceleration
of the whole sphere begin to dominate. We were unable to trigger a collapse for
$\xi_{max}<2$, which leads to the conclusion that a stellar wind can move the
smallest unstable stellar mass to $0.5\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and destabilizing
even smaller cores would require an external pressure larger than
$10^5k_B\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$. For $\xi_{max}>4.2$ the expected wind strength
according to our criterion is small enough so that the compression is slower
than the sound speed of the BES and sound waves can be triggered. In this case
our criterion underestimates somewhat the onset of collapse and detailed
numerical analyses are required.

the chain geometry, we also unveil block magnetism beyond the $2 \times 2$
pattern (with block sizes varying as a function of the electron doping) and
also an interaction-induced frustrated block-spiral state (a spiral order of
rigidly rotating ferromagnetic islands). Moreover, we predict new phases beyond
the one-dimensional system: a robust regime of phase separation close to
half-filling, incommensurate antiferromagnetism for weak interaction, and a
quantum spin-flux phase of staggered plaquette spin currents at intermediate
doping. Finally, exploiting the bonding/antibonding band occupations, we
provide an intuitive physical picture giving insight into the structure of the

timescales. If and how this ability can emerge without external fine-tuning is
a puzzle. We consider here this problem in discrete Markovian systems, where we
can leverage results from random matrix theory. Indeed, generic large
transition matrices are governed by universal results, which predict the
absence of long timescales unless fine-tuned. We consider an ensemble of
transition matrices and motivate a temperature-like variable that controls the
dynamic range of matrix elements, which we show plays a crucial role in the
applicability of the large matrix limit: as the dynamic range increases, a
phase transition occurs whereby the random matrix theory result is avoided, and
long relaxation times ensue, in the entire `ordered' phase. We furthermore show
that this phase transition is accompanied by a drop in the entropy rate and a
peak in complexity, as measured by predictive information (Bialek, Nemenman,
Tishby Neural Computation 13(21) 2001). Extending the Markov model to a Hidden
Markov model (HMM), we show that observable sequences inherit properties of the
hidden sequences, allowing HMMs to be understood in terms of more accessible
Markov models. We then apply our findings to fMRI data from 820 human subjects
scanned at wakeful rest. We show that the data can be quantitatively understood

transition when engaged in unconstrained, task-free cognition -- supporting the

Feshbach resonance many real world resonances appear in close vicinity to each
other and are therefore overlapping. Here we derive a realistic model based on
the mutual coupling of an open channel and two closed molecular channels while
neglecting short-range physics as permitted by the narrow character of the
considered resonances. The model is applied to three distinct scenarios with
experimental relevance. We show that the effect of overlapping resonances is
manifested most strikingly at a narrow resonance in whose vicinity there is a
slightly narrower one. In this system the Efimov ground state extends not only
over the scattering length zero crossing between the two resonances but also
over the pole of the second resonance to finally meet the dissociation
threshold below it. In the opposite scenario, when a narrow resonance is
considered in the vicinity of a slightly broader one, we observe that the
Efimov features are pushed to lower binding energies and smaller scattering
lengths by a significant factor facilitating their experimental investigation.
Both scenarios are referenced to the case of two narrow resonances which are
far enough away from each other to be effectively decoupled. In this case the
two-channel model results are recovered. Finally, we analyze the rich
excitation spectrum of the system and construct and explain its nodal pattern.

  In our survey of 158 professional software developers, most indicated that

riskiness of this practice using a novel regex corpus -- 537,806 regexes from

vulnerabilities due to performance differences.
  We report that developers' belief in a regex lingua franca is understandable

exhibit semantic differences across languages and 10% exhibit performance
differences across languages. We explained these differences using regex
documentation, and further illuminate our findings by investigating regex

  VDB Data Structure",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a fundamental algorithm, called VDB-EDT, for Euclidean
distance transform (EDT) based on the VDB data structure. The algorithm
executes on grid maps and generates the corresponding distance field for
recording distance information against obstacles, which forms the basis of
numerous motion planning algorithms. The contributions of this work mainly lie
in three folds. Firstly, we propose a novel algorithm that can facilitate
distance transform procedures by optimizing the scheduling priorities of
transform functions, which significantly improves the running speed of
conventional EDT algorithms. Secondly, we for the first time introduce the
memory-efficient VDB data structure, a customed B+ tree, to represent the
distance field hierarchically. Benefiting from the special index and caching
mechanism, VDB shows a fast (average \textit{O}(1)) random access speed, and
thus is very suitable for the frequent neighbor-searching operations in EDT.
Moreover, regarding the small scale of existing datasets, we release a
large-scale dataset captured from subterranean environments to benchmark EDT
algorithms. Extensive experiments on the released dataset and publicly
available datasets show that VDB-EDT can reduce memory consumption by about
30%-85%, depending on the sparsity of the environment, while maintaining a
competitive running speed with the fastest array-based implementation. The
experiments also show that VDB-EDT can significantly outperform the
state-of-the-art EDT algorithm in both runtime and memory efficiency, which
strongly demonstrates the advantages of our proposed method. The released
dataset and source code are available on https://github.com/zhudelong/VDB-EDT.

forefront of recent research in nano-magnetism with the promise for fast and
energy-efficient devices. The recently demonstrated possibilities to stabilize
such chiral structures in synthetic antiferromagnets (SAF) has raised interests
as they are immune to dipolar field, hence favoring the stabilization of ultra
small textures, improve mobility and avoid the transverse deflections of moving
skyrmions limiting the efficiency in some foreseen applications. However, such
systems with zero net magnetization are hence difficult to characterize by most
of the standard techniques. Here, we report that the relevant parameters of a
magnetic SAF texture, those being its period, its type (N\'eel or Bloch) and
its chirality (clockwise or counterclockwise), can be directly determined using
the circular dichroism in x-ray resonant scattering (CD-XRMS) at half integer
multilayer Bragg peaks in reciprocal space. The analysis of the dependence in
temperature down to 40K allows us moreover to address the question of the
temperature stability of a spin spiral in a SAF sample and of the temperature
scaling of the symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions.

LIGO/Virgo. Their detection and source characterization would provide a unique
probe of strong-field gravity and stellar evolution. Due to the asymmetric
component masses and the large primary, these systems generically excite
subdominant modes while reducing the importance of the dominant quadrupole
mode. Including higher order harmonics can also result in a $10\%-25\%$
increase in signal-to-noise ratio for IMRIs, which may help to detect these
systems. We show that by including subdominant GW modes into the analysis we
can achieve a precise characterization of IMRI source properties. For example,
we find that the source properties for IMRIs can be measured to within
$2\%-15\%$ accuracy at a fiducial signal-to-noise ratio of 25 if subdominant
modes are included. When subdominant modes are neglected, the accuracy degrades
to $9\%-44\%$ and significant biases are seen in chirp mass, mass ratio,
primary spin and luminosity distances. We further demonstrate that including
subdominant modes in the waveform model can enable an informative measurement
of both individual spin components and improve the source localization by a
factor of $\sim$10. We discuss some important astrophysical implications of
high-precision source characterization enabled by subdominant modes such as
constraining the mass gap and probing formation channels.

through widely distributed low-cost sensors. However, measurements from these
sensors usually encounter high biases and require a calibration step to reach
an acceptable performance in down-streaming analytical tasks. Most existing
calibration methods calibrate one type of sensor at a time, which we call
single-task calibration. Despite the popularity of this single-task schema, it
may neglect interactions among calibration tasks of different sensors, which
encompass underlying information to promote calibration performance. In this
paper, we propose a multi-task calibration network (MTNet) to calibrate
multiple sensors (e.g., carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide sensors)
simultaneously, modeling the interactions among tasks. MTNet consists of a
single shared module, and several task-specific modules. Specifically, in the
shared module, we extend the multi-gate mixture-of-experts structure to
harmonize the task conflicts and correlations among different tasks; in each
task-specific module, we introduce a feature selection strategy to customize
the input for the specific task. These improvements allow MTNet to learn
interaction information shared across different tasks, and task-specific
information for each calibration task as well. We evaluate MTNet on three
real-world datasets and compare it with several established baselines. The
experimental results demonstrate that MTNet achieves the state-of-the-art
performance.

training data, a current bottleneck is the labelling cost. A feasible solution
to this problem is semi-supervised learning, exploiting a small portion of
labelled data and large amounts of unlabelled data. The major challenge,
however, is the accumulated label errors through auto-labelling, compromising
the training. This paper presents an effective solution to semi-supervised face
recognition that is robust to the label noise aroused by the auto-labelling.
Specifically, we introduce a multi-agent method, named GroupNet (GN), to endow
our solution with the ability to identify the wrongly labelled samples and
preserve the clean samples. We show that GN alone achieves the leading accuracy
in traditional supervised face recognition even when the noisy labels take over
50\% of the training data. Further, we develop a semi-supervised face
recognition solution, named Noise Robust Learning-Labelling (NRoLL), which is
based on the robust training ability empowered by GN. It starts with a small
amount of labelled data and consequently conducts high-confidence labelling on
a large amount of unlabelled data to boost further training. The more data is
labelled by NRoLL, the higher confidence is with the label in the dataset. To
evaluate the competitiveness of our method, we run NRoLL with a rough condition
that only one-fifth of the labelled MSCeleb is available and the rest is used
as unlabelled data. On a wide range of benchmarks, our method compares
favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

in Ising models on such complex topologies. This applies in particular to the
transition into a globally ordered network state, which thereby proceeds in a
hierarchical fashion, and with a non-trivial local structure. Standard
mean-field theory of Ising models on scale-free networks underrates the
presence of the hubs, while nevertheless providing remarkably reliable
estimates for the onset of global order. Here, we expose that a spurious
self-feedback effect, inherent to mean-field theory, underlies this apparent
paradox. More specifically, we demonstrate that higher order interaction
effects precisely cancel the self-feedback on the hubs, and we expose the
importance of hubs for the distinct onset of local versus global order in the
network. Due to the generic nature of our arguments, we expect the mechanism
that we uncover for the archetypal case of Ising networks of the
Barab\'asi-Albert type to be also relevant for other systems with a strongly
hierarchical underlying network structure.

sequentially. Despite the lots of previous solutions, most of them still suffer

these problems, we first study the continual learning process through the lens
of information theory and observe that forgetting of a model stems from the
loss of \emph{information gain} on its parameters from the previous tasks when
learning a new task. From this viewpoint, we then propose a novel continual
learning approach called Bit-Level Information Preserving (BLIP) that preserves
the information gain on model parameters through updating the parameters at the
bit level, which can be conveniently implemented with parameter quantization.
More specifically, BLIP first trains a neural network with weight quantization
on the new incoming task and then estimates information gain on each parameter
provided by the task data to determine the bits to be frozen to prevent
forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments ranging from classification tasks
to reinforcement learning tasks, and the results show that our method produces
better or on par results comparing to previous state-of-the-arts. Indeed, BLIP
achieves close to zero forgetting while only requiring constant memory
overheads throughout continual learning.

proposed technique for estimating the distance to a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
from minimal observations. Our method, which has become possible owing to
recent work in the application of deep learning to SN Ia spectra (we use the
deepSIP package), allows us to estimate the distance to an SN Ia from a single
optical spectrum and epoch of $2+$ passband photometry -- one night's worth of
observations (though contemporaneity is not a requirement). Using a compilation
of well-observed SNe Ia, we generate snapshot distances across a wide range of
spectral and photometric phases, light-curve shapes, photometric passband
combinations, and spectrum signal-to-noise ratios. By comparing these estimates
to the corresponding distances derived from fitting all available photometry
for each object, we demonstrate that our method is robust to the relative
temporal sampling of the provided spectroscopic and photometric information,
and to a broad range of light-curve shapes that lie within the domain of
standard width-luminosity relations. Indeed, the median residual (and
asymmetric scatter) between SDM distances derived from two-passband photometry
and conventional light-curve-derived distances that utilise all available
photometry is $0.013_{-0.143}^{+0.154}$ mag. Moreover, we find that the time of
maximum brightness and light-curve shape (both of which are spectroscopically
derived in our method) are only minimally responsible for the observed scatter.
In a companion paper, we apply the SDM to a large number of sparsely observed
SNe Ia as part of a cosmological study.

in populations of interacting individuals. Such a modeling framework, however,
is naturally limited to pairwise interactions, making it less suitable to
properly describe social contagion, where individuals acquire new norms or
ideas after simultaneous exposure to multiple sources of infections. Simplicial
contagion has been proposed as an alternative framework where simplices are
used to encode group interactions of any order. The presence of higher-order
interactions leads to explosive epidemic transitions and bistability which
cannot be obtained when only dyadic ties are considered. In particular,
critical mass effects can emerge even for infectivity values below the standard
pairwise epidemic threshold, where the size of the initial seed of infectious
nodes determines whether the system would eventually fall in the endemic or the
healthy state. Here we extend simplicial contagion to time-varying networks,
where pairwise and higher-order simplices can be created or destroyed over
time. By following a microscopic Markov chain approach, we find that the same
seed of infectious nodes might or might not lead to an endemic stationary
state, depending on the temporal properties of the underlying network
structure, and show that persistent temporal interactions anticipate the onset
of the endemic state in finite-size systems. We characterize this behavior on
higher-order networks with a prescribed temporal correlation between
consecutive interactions and on heterogeneous simplicial complexes, showing
that temporality again limits the effect of higher-order spreading, but in a
less pronounced way than for homogeneous structures. Our work suggests the
importance of incorporating temporality, a realistic feature of many real-world
systems, into the investigation of dynamical processes beyond pairwise
interactions.

In addition, it is not easy for the conventional method to compute the gradient
of the sound pressure on the surface, which is necessary to compute the shape
derivative of our interest, of a given object. To overcome these issues, we
employ the isogeometric boundary element method (IGBEM), which was developed in
our previous work. With using the IGBEM, we can design the shape of surfaces
through control points of the NURBS surfaces of the target object. We integrate
the IGBEM with the nonlinear programming software through the adjoint variable
method (AVM), where the resulting adjoint boundary value problem can be also
solved by the IGBEM with a slight modification. The numerical verification and
demonstration validate our shape optimisation framework.

the relative strength of the nonlinear interactions compared to the linear

excitations (LNEs) produced by a bond squeeze can be reduced to an approximate
two-frequency solution and then show that the nonlinear term in the potential
can lead to the production of secondary frequencies within the phonon band.
This can affect the stability and lifetime of the LNE by facilitating
interactions between the LNE and a low energy acoustic background which can be
regarded as ""noise"" in the system. In the one dimensional FPUT chain, the LNE
is stabilized by low energy acoustic emissions at early times; in some cases
allowing for lifetimes several orders of magnitude larger than the oscillation
period. The longest lived LNEs are found to satisfy the parameter dependence
$\mathcal{A}\sqrt{\beta}\approx1.1$ where $\beta$ is the relative nonlinear
strength and $\mathcal{A}$ is the displacement amplitude of the center
particles in the LNE. In the cubic FPUT lattice, the LNE lifetime $T$ decreases
rapidly with increasing amplitude $\mathcal{A}$ and is well described by the
double log relationship $\log_{10}\log_{10}(T)\approx
-(0.15\pm0.01)\mathcal{A}\sqrt{\beta}+(0.62\pm0.02)$.

Applications range from
representation learning, image translation and generative modeling, to the
estimation of spatial deformations. Such maps relate feature vectors, or map
between feature spaces. Well-behaved maps should be regular, which can be
imposed explicitly or may emanate from the data itself. We explore what induces
regularity for spatial transformations, e.g., when computing image
registrations. Classical optimization-based models compute maps between pairs
of samples and rely on an appropriate regularizer for well-posedness. Recent
deep learning approaches have attempted to avoid using such regularizers
altogether by relying on the sample population instead. We explore if it is
possible to obtain spatial regularity using an inverse consistency loss only
and elucidate what explains map regularity in such a context. We find that deep
networks combined with an inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid
interpolation yield well behaved, approximately diffeomorphic, spatial
transformations. Despite the simplicity of this approach, our experiments
present compelling evidence, on both synthetic and real data, that regular maps
can be obtained without carefully tuned explicit regularizers, while achieving

classification, which is usually optimized with convex surrogates for
computational efficiency. Prior theoretical work on multi-label ranking mainly
focuses on (Fisher) consistency analyses. However, there is a gap between
existing theory and practice -- some pairwise losses can lead to promising
performance but lack consistency, while some univariate losses are consistent
but usually have no clear superiority in practice. In this paper, we attempt to
fill this gap through a systematic study from two complementary perspectives of
consistency and generalization error bounds of learning algorithms. Our results
show that learning algorithms with the consistent univariate loss have an error
bound of $O(c)$ ($c$ is the number of labels), while algorithms with the
inconsistent pairwise loss depend on $O(\sqrt{c})$ as shown in prior work. This
explains that the latter can achieve better performance than the former in
practice. Moreover, we present an inconsistent reweighted univariate loss-based
learning algorithm that enjoys an error bound of $O(\sqrt{c})$ for promising
performance as well as the computational efficiency of univariate losses.
Finally, experimental results validate our theoretical analyses.

the generation of adversarial examples from the view of adversarial robustness,
takes the perturbations added in adversarial examples as the optimization

optimization. The algorithm introduces improved Nesterov momentum, using its
characteristics of accelerating convergence and improving gradient update
direction in optimization algorithm to accelerate the generation of adversarial

optimization, and the projected gradient descent algorithm is used to limit the
range of the generated perturbations in each warm restart, which can obtain
better attack effect. Experiments on two public datasets show that the
algorithm proposed in this work can improve the success rate of attacking deep
learning models without extra time cost. Compared with the benchmark attack
method, the algorithm proposed in this work can achieve better attack success
rate for both normal training model and defense model. Our method has average

an equation-of-state consistent with the zero active mass condition in general

been studied in the recent years, and lacks approaches in the deep SSDML
scenario. In this paper, we address this challenging problem, and revamp SSDML
with respect to deep learning. In particular, we propose a stochastic,
graph-based approach that first propagates the affinities between the pairs of
examples from labeled data, to that of the unlabeled pairs. The propagated
affinities are used to mine triplet based constraints for metric learning. We
impose orthogonality constraint on the metric parameters, as it leads to a
better performance by avoiding a model collapse.

communications and entertainment. Such advanced development of these fields was
directly related to ability of controlling light. Photonics is exactly about
this ability. At the present time, photonics is walking together with a
fundamental physical concept, optical soliton. Optical solitons are
shape-preserving laser beams. They are found potentially useful in data
transmission, which is very significant nowadays. Hence, research in the field
of optical solitons is still a vital issue. When optical soliton is perturbed
in a specific manner, there appear zeros of optical field around the soliton,
which are called optical vortices. In general optical vortices are lines in
space. Hence, we might expect them to become knotted. Knotting optical vortices
around perturbed seems spontaneous and cannot be directly predicted. To explain
this phenomenon, a similar system is constructed based on perturbation theory.
In this system, however, we have a mathematical problem which yet lacks a full
understanding. We address this problem by introducing concepts from three
disciplines: laser physics, knot theory and singular optics. We believe that
understanding the mechanism underlying spontaneous knotting of optical vortices
will be a step forward in other systems too, such as quantum turbulence in
superfluids and formation of optical vortices around other types of optical
solitons.

predict the expected chirp mass and mass ratio distributions for GW transients,
taking account of detector sensitivity to determine how many events should have
been detected by the current detector network in O3(a+b). We investigate how
these predictions change by alternating between four different remnant mass
estimation schemes and two supernovae (SNe) kick prescriptions. We find that
none of the model populations resulting from these variations accurately match
the whole O3(a+b) GW transient catalog. However, agreement from some models to
part of the catalog suggests ways to achieve a more complete fit. These include
reducing the number of low mass black holes (BHs) close to the mass gap, while
also increasing the number of higher mass BHs below the pair-instability SN
limit. Finally, we find that the interaction between the value of the remnant
mass from a stellar model and the choice of SN kick is complex and different
kick prescriptions may be required depending on whether a neutron star or BH is
formed.

Specifically, we first investigate the impact on the models caused by
unreliable clients by deriving a convergence upper bound on the loss function

a fixed amount of total computational resources, there exists an optimal number
of local training iterations in terms of convergence performance. We further
design a novel defensive mechanism, named deep neural network based secure

specifically, a wide residual network and a residual U-Net. The workflow is
validated against a flat three-dimensional reservoir model representative of a
clastic shelf depositional environment. Intelligent treatments are applied to
bridge between quantities in a true-3D reservoir model and those in a
single-layer reservoir model. The workflow can complete history matching and
reservoir forecasting with uncertainty quantification in less than one hour on

considering the wide range of dynamics affecting trajectory, many of which may

for unknown factors and the effects of the deformation of the object as it is
launched; moreover, deriving force coefficients for these models is not
possible without extensive experimental testing. Recently, advancements in
data-powered artificial intelligence methods have allowed learnable models and
systems to emerge. It is desirable to train a model for launch prediction on a
robot, as deep neural networks can account for immeasurable dynamics. However,
the inability to collect large amounts of experimental data decreases
performance of deep neural networks. Through estimating force coefficients, the
accepted physics models can be leveraged to produce adequate supplemental data
to artificially increase the size of the training set, yielding improved neural
networks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for algorithmic
estimation of force coefficients for non-rigid object launching, which can be
generalized to other domains, in order to generate large datasets. We implement
a novel training algorithm and objective for our deep neural network to
accurately model launch trajectory of non-rigid objects and predict whether

This framework specifically targets the coexistence of heterogenous
technologies, e.g., Wi-Fi, 4G Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA), and 5G New Radio
Unlicensed (NR-U), over unlicensed channels. To access the channel, a device
compares the measured power with a predefined ST value and accordingly decides
if the channel is idle or not. Improper setting of the ST values creates
asymmetric sensing floors, resulting in collisions due to hidden terminals
and/or reduction in the spatial reuse due to exposed terminals. Optimal ST
setting is challenging because it requires global knowledge of mobility,
traffic loads, and channel access behavior of all contending devices. Sense-
Bandits tackles this problem by employing a clustering-based multi-armed bandit
(MAB) algorithm, which adapts its learning behavior based on network dynamics.
Clustering allows the algorithm to track network changes in real-time, ensuring
fast learning of the best ST values by classifying the state and dynamics of
coexisting networks. We develop a C++-based network simulator that implements
Sense-Bandits and we apply it to evaluate the coexistence of Wi-Fi and 5G NR-U
systems over the unlicensed 5 GHz U NII bands. Our simulation results indicate
that ST-adaptive devices employing Sense-Bandits do not harm neighboring
devices that adopt a fixed ST value.

paper develops a grey-box modelling approach to improve the predictions of the
force on structural members. A grey-box model intends to exploit the enhanced
predictive capabilities of data-based modelling whilst retaining physical
insight into the behaviour of the system; in the context of the work carried
out here, this can be considered as physics-informed machine learning. There
are a number of possible approaches to establish a grey-box model. This paper
demonstrates two means of combining physics (white box) and data-based (black
box) components; one where the model is a simple summation of the two
components, the second where the white-box prediction is fed into the black box
as an additional input. Here Morison's equation is used as the physics-based
component in combination with a data-based Gaussian process NARX - a dynamic
variant of the more well-known Gaussian process regression. Two key challenges
with employing the GP-NARX formulation that are addressed here are the
selection of appropriate lag terms and the proper treatment of uncertainty
propagation within the dynamic GP. The best performing grey-box model, the
residual modelling GP-NARX, was able to achieve a 29.13\% and 5.48\% relative
reduction in NMSE over Morison's Equation and a black-box GP-NARX respectively,
alongside significant benefits in extrapolative capabilities of the model, in

we study the path integral representation of a particle moving in an arbitrary
potential using the most general form of the GUP containing both the linear and
quadratic contributions in momentum. First we work out the action of the
particle in an arbitrary potential and hence find an upper bound to the
velocity of a free particle. This upper bound interestingly imposes
restrictions on the relation between the GUP parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
Analysis shows that $ \beta > 4 \alpha^2$. We then deduce the mathematical

scalarized function of the energy of the communicating pair and the RIS panel

Although the formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-linear problem, the
optimal solution is found by linearizing the non-linear constraints. Besides, a
more efficient close to the optimal solution is found using Bender
