it requires expertise and experience to identify abnormalities. It is thus
crucial to develop automated models for the detection of abnormalities in EEGs
related to epilepsy. This paper describes the development of a novel class of
compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting abnormal patterns
and electrodes in EEGs for epilepsy. The designed model is inspired by a CNN
developed for brain-computer interfacing called multichannel EEGNet (mEEGNet).
Unlike the EEGNet, the proposed model, mEEGNet, has the same number of
electrode inputs and outputs to detect abnormal patterns. The mEEGNet was
evaluated with a clinical dataset consisting of 29 cases of juvenile and
childhood absence epilepsy labeled by a clinical expert. The labels were given
to paroxysmal discharges visually observed in both ictal (seizure) and
interictal (nonseizure) durations. Results showed that the mEEGNet detected
abnormalities with the area under the curve, F1-values, and sensitivity
equivalent to or higher than those of existing CNNs. Moreover, the number of
parameters is much smaller than other CNN models. To our knowledge, the dataset
of absence epilepsy validated with machine learning through this research is
the largest in the literature.

equations with an operator function (matrix function). In particular, in the
last decade, mathematical models with a fractional power of an elliptic
operator and numerical methods for their study have been actively discussed.
Computational algorithms for such non-standard problems are based on
approximations by the operator function. The most widespread are the approaches
using various options for rational approximation. Also, we note the methods
that relate to approximation by exponential sums. In this paper, the
possibility of using approximation by exponential products is noted. The
solution of an equation with an operator function is based on the transition to
standard stationary or evolutionary problems. General approaches are
illustrated by a problem with a fractional power of the operator. The first
class of methods is based on the integral representation of the operator
function under rational approximation, approximation by exponential sums, and
approximation by exponential products. The second class of methods is
associated with solving an auxiliary Cauchy problem for some evolutionary
equation.

prices to a buyer who will purchase at most one. Typically, retailers select a
subset of items, corresponding to an ""assortment"" of brands to carry, and make
each selected item available for purchase at its brand-recommended price.
Despite the tremendous importance in practice, the best method for selling
these fixed-price items is not well understood, as retailers have begun
experimenting with making certain items available only through a lottery.
  In this paper we analyze the maximum possible revenue that can be earned in
this setting, given that the buyer's preference is private but drawn from a
known distribution. In particular, we introduce a Bayesian mechanism design
problem where the buyer has a random ranking over fixed-price items and an
outside option, and the seller optimizes a (randomized) allocation of up to one
item. We show that allocations corresponding to assortments are suboptimal in
general, but under many commonly-studied Bayesian priors for buyer rankings
such as the MNL and Markov Chain choice models, assortments are in fact
optimal. Therefore, this large literature on assortment optimization has much
greater significance than appreciated before -- it is not only computing
optimal assortments; it is computing the economic limit of the seller's revenue
for these fixed-price substitute items.
  We derive several further results -- a more general sufficient condition for
assortments being optimal that captures choice models beyond Markov Chain, a
proof that Nested Logit choice models cannot be captured by Markov Chain but
can be partially captured by our condition, and suboptimality gaps for
assortments when our condition does not hold. Finally, we show that our
mechanism design problem provides the tightest-known LP relaxation for
assortment optimization under the ranking distribution model.

the intersection of Social Choice, Computational Economics and Discrete
Allocation. In a general assignment problem, a group of agents expresses
preferences over a set of items, and the task is to allocate items to agents in
an ""optimal"" way. A verification variant of this problem includes an allocation
as part of the input, and the question becomes whether this allocation is
""optimal"". In this paper, we generalize the verification variant to the setting
where each agent is equipped with multiple incomplete preference lists: Each
list (called a layer) is a ranking of items in a possibly different way
according to a different criterion.
  In particular, we introduce three multi-layer verification problems, each
corresponds to an optimality notion that weakens the notion of global
optimality (that is, pareto optimality in multiple layers) in a different way.
Informally, the first notion requires that, for each group of agents whose size
is exactly some input parameter k, the agents in the group will not be able to
trade their assigned items among themselves and benefit in at least alpha
layers; the second notion is similar, but it concerns all groups of size at
most k rather than exactly k; the third notion strengthens these notions by
requiring that groups of k agents will not be part of possibly larger groups
that benefit in at least alpha layers. We study the three problems from the
perspective of parameterized complexity under several natural parameterizations
such as the number of layers, the number of agents, the number of items, the
number of allocated items, the maximum length of a preference list, and more.
We present an almost comprehensive picture of the parameterized complexity of
the problems with respect to these parameters.

Our key observation is that generating holistic features for fine-grained

Therefore, we propose a feature composition framework that learns to extract
attribute features from training samples and combines them to construct
fine-grained features for rare and unseen classes. Feature composition allows
us to not only selectively compose features of every class from only relevant
training samples, but also obtain diversity among composed features via
changing samples used for the composition. In addition, instead of building
holistic features for classes, we use our attribute features to form dense
representations capable of capturing fine-grained attribute details of classes.
We propose a training scheme that uses a discriminative model to construct
features that are subsequently used to train the model itself. Therefore, we
directly train the discriminative model on the composed features without
learning a separate generative model. We conduct experiments on four popular
datasets of DeepFashion, AWA2, CUB, and SUN, showing the effectiveness of our
method.

little-known diagonal estimation rule. For a large class of compressed sensing
matrices, we provide theoretical justifications for why our method scales well

view-dependent appearance. The core intuition behind our method is that better
drivability and generalization can be achieved by disentangling the driving
signals and remaining generative factors, which are not available during
animation. To this end, we explicitly account for information deficiency in the
driving signal by introducing a latent space that exclusively captures the
remaining information, thus enabling the imputation of the missing factors
required during full-body animation, while remaining faithful to the driving
signal. We also propose a learnable localized compression for the driving
signal which promotes better generalization, and helps minimize the influence
of global chance-correlations often found in real datasets. For a given driving
signal, the resulting variational model produces a compact space of uncertainty
for missing factors that allows for an imputation strategy best suited to a
particular application. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the

However, these algorithms do not cover the accurate localization of the Gleason

work is the proposed weakly-supervised-trained convolutional neural network,
WeGleNet, based on a multi-class segmentation layer after the feature

patterns in the validation cohort. We compared the model performance for
semantic segmentation of Gleason grades with supervised state-of-the-art

macro-averaged f1-score of 0.58, at the same level as fully-supervised methods.
Regarding the estimation of the core-level Gleason score, we obtained a k of

fine-tuning via back propagation. All components of so-obtained ""white-box""

Moreover, all linear operators of the so-derived network naturally become
multi-channel convolutions when we enforce classification to be rigorously
shift-invariant. The derivation in the invariant setting suggests a trade-off
between sparsity and invariance, and also indicates that such a deep
convolution network is significantly more efficient to construct and learn in
the spectral domain. Our preliminary simulations and experiments clearly verify

unavoidable by symmetry in the $(E)$ subset of electronic states supporting the

order of magnitude, already for moderate vibronic coupling strengths, as

continuous Abelian symmetries using discrete approximations, we define an
extended-O(2) model by adding a $\gamma \cos(q\varphi)$ term to the ordinary
O(2) model with angular values restricted to a $2\pi$ interval. In the $\gamma
\rightarrow \infty$ limit, the model becomes an extended $q$-state clock model
that reduces to the ordinary $q$-state clock model when $q$ is an integer and
otherwise is a continuation of the clock model for noninteger $q$. By shifting
the $2\pi$ integration interval, the number of angles selected can change
discontinuously and two cases need to be considered. What we call case $1$ has
one more angle than what we call case $2$. We investigate this class of clock
models in two space-time dimensions using Monte Carlo and tensor
renormalization group methods. Both the specific heat and the magnetic
susceptibility show a double-peak structure for fractional $q$. In case $1$,
the small-$\beta$ peak is associated with a crossover, and the large-$\beta$
peak is associated with an Ising critical point, while both peaks are
crossovers in case $2$. When $q$ is close to an integer by an amount $\Delta q$
and the system is close to the small-$\beta$ Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition, the system has a magnetic susceptibility that scales as $\sim 1 /
(\Delta q)^{1 - 1/\delta'}$ with $\delta'$ estimates consistent with the
magnetic critical exponent $\delta = 15$. The crossover peak and the Ising
critical point move to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition points with
the same power-law scaling. A phase diagram for this model in the $(\beta, q)$
plane is sketched. These results are possibly relevant for configurable
Rydberg-atom arrays where the interpolations among phases with discrete

Periodic actin and spectrin structures are found in dendrites, initial segment

be manipulating the axon stability and mechanical behavior. Several
experimental and computational studies have been performed focusing on the
mechanical behavior of actin, spectrin, and actin and spectrin network.
However, most of the actin studies focus on typical long F actin and do not
provide quantitative comparison between the mechanical behavior of short and
long actin filaments. Also, most of the spectrin studies focus on erythrocytic
spectrin and do not shed light on the behavior of structurally different axonal
spectrin. Only a few studies have highlighted forced unfolding of axonal
spectrin which are relevant to brain injury scenario. A comprehensive, strain
rate dependent mechanical study is still absent in the literature. Moreover,
the current opinions regarding periodic actin and spectrin network structure in
axon are disputed due to conflicting results on actin ring organization as
argued by recent superresolution microscopy studies. This review summarizes the
ongoing limitations in this regard and provides insights on possible approaches
to address them. This study will invoke further investigation into relevant

Way. Several images and studies exist at all wavelengths from radio to hard
X-ray. Nevertheless, only a few observations are available in the microwave
range where its average radio emission reaches the minimum. In this paper, we
want to study the radio morphology of the galaxy, decouple thermal from
nonthermal emission, and extract the star formation rate. We also aim to derive
a complete catalog of radio sources for the mapped patch of sky. We observed
the Andromeda galaxy with the Sardinia Radio Telescope at 6.6 GHz with very
high sensitivity and angular resolution, and an unprecedented sky coverage.
Using new 6.6 GHz data and Effelsberg radio telescope ancillary data, we
confirm that, globally, the spectral index is $\sim 0.7-0.8$, while in the star
forming regions it decreases to $\sim 0.5$. By disentangling (gas) thermal and
nonthermal emission, we find that at 6.6 GHz, thermal emission follows the
distribution of HII regions around the ring. Nonthermal emission within the
ring appears smoother and more uniform than thermal emission because of
diffusion of the cosmic ray electrons away from their birthplaces. This causes
the magnetic fields to appear almost constant in intensity. Furthermore, we
calculated a map of the star formation rate based on the map of thermal
emission. Integrating within a radius of $R_{max}=15$ kpc, we obtained a total
star formation rate of $0.19 \pm 0.01$ $M_{\odot}$/yr in agreement with
previous results in the literature. Finally, we correlated our radio data with
infrared images of the Andromeda galaxy. We find an unexpectedly high
correlation between nonthermal and mid-infrared data in the central region,

of a system modulo the conservation laws of local observables: extremization of
entropy immediately gives Gibbs' ensemble (GE) for energy conserving systems
and a generalized version of it (GGE) when the number of local conserved
quantities (LCQ) is more than one. Through the last decade, statistical
mechanics has been extended to describe the late-time behaviour of periodically
driven (Floquet) quantum matter starting from a generic state. The structure
built on the fundamental assumptions of ergodicity and identification of the
relevant ""conservation laws"" in this inherently non-equilibrium setting. More
recently, it has been shown that the statistical mechanics has a much richer
structure due to the existence of {\it emergent} conservation laws: these are
approximate but stable conservation laws arising {\it due to the drive}, and
are not present in the undriven system. Extensive numerical and analytical
results support perpetual stability of these emergent (though approximate)
conservation laws, probably even in the thermodynamic limit. This banks on the
recent finding of a sharp ergodicity threshold for Floquet thermalization in
clean, interacting non-integrable Floquet systems. This opens up a new
possibility of stable Floquet engineering in such systems. This review intends
to give a theoretical overview of these developments. We conclude by briefly

density $J$ will become space-charge-limited current (SCLC) due the built-up of
charge in-transit within a gap spacing $D$ biased at sufficiently large voltage
$V$. In this paper, we reveal a peculiar finding in which this expected
two-stage transition (from FE to SCLC) is no longer valid for FE not obeying
the traditional Fowler-Nordheim (FN) law. %Such effect arises when the non-FN
based emitters fails to inject sufficient %charge current at high voltage to
sustain the SCLC. By employing a generalized FN scaling of
$\ln\left(J/V^k\right) \propto - 1/V$, we show the existence of a
\emph{critical exponent} $k_c \equiv 3/2$ where unusual behaviours occur for $k
< k_c$: (a) Only FE at small $D$ (no transition to SCLC even at infinitely
large $V$), and (b) Three-stage transition from FE first to SCLC then back to
FE at large $D$. For any $k > k_c$, the conventional two-stage transition from
FE to SCLC will always occur for all $D$, which also includes the conventional
FN law at $k$ = 2. Using various unconventional FE models with $k \neq 2$, we
specifically demonstrate these peculiar transitions. Under a normalized model,
our findings uncover the rich interplay between the source-limited FE and
bulk-limited SCLC over a wide range of operating conditions.

difference methods with different spatial discretizations for the Dirac
equation with small electromagnetic potentials characterized by $\varepsilon
\in (0, 1]$ a dimensionless parameter. We begin with the simple and widely used
finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods, and establish rigorous error
bounds of them, which are valid up to the time at $O(1/\varepsilon)$. In the
error estimates, we pay particular attention to how the errors depend
explicitly on the mesh size $h$ and time step $\tau$ as well as the small
parameter $\varepsilon$. Based on the results, in order to obtain ""correct""
numerical solutions up to the time at $O(1/\varepsilon)$, the
$\varepsilon$-scalability (or meshing strategy requirement) of the FDTD methods
should be taken as $h = O(\varepsilon^{1/2})$ and $\tau =
O(\varepsilon^{1/2})$. To improve the spatial resolution capacity, we apply the
Fourier spectral method to discretize the Dirac equation in space. Error bounds
of the resulting finite difference Fourier pseudospectral (FDFP) methods show
that they exhibit uniform spatial errors in the long-time regime, which are
optimal in space as suggested by the Shannon's sampling theorem. Extensive
numerical results are reported to confirm the error bounds and demonstrate that
they are sharp.

Riemannian geometry and the Fisher information metric. It is used to construct
a coordinate transformation that relates the Riemannian manifold associated
with the metric to Euclidean space. The distribution, expressed in the
coordinate system induced by the transformation, takes a particularly simple
form that allows for an accurate variational approximation by a normal

implementation of geoVI which is demonstrated on multiple examples, ranging
from low-dimensional illustrative ones to non-linear, hierarchical Bayesian

ribbon-like molecular columns with left- or right-handed 180degree twist lie on
the bonds of a honeycomb lattice so that three ribbons meet in a vertex of the
hexagonal honeycomb. The energy of each vertex is a minimum if the three
ribbons have the same chirality, -E, and is +E otherwise, and the ground state
is homochiral, i.e. all ribbons have the same hand. The energy levels for two
vertices linked by a single ribbon are either -2E, 0 and +2 E in this vertex
model. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that this model is identical to an
Ising spin model on a Kagome lattice, for which the site energy structure is
quite different. The equivalence of the ordering of the vertex and Ising spin
models is also shown analytically. The energy difference between the disordered

temperature for the Kagome lattice using the exact result, Tc=2.14J. The
ordering energy difference for a single site is 50% higher for the vertex
model. The thermodynamic energy for the vertex model is corrected by a factor
of 1/3 due to double counting and this makes the specific heat of the vertex
model also equal to that of the spin model as expected. Other similar models
where there is an unusual relation between the site and thermodynamic energies

reflected in the detailed energy distribution of the photoelectrons. Ultrafast

ability to probe a transient state of the many-body system. Here we use a free
electron laser to investigate the effect of a transiently excited electron gas
on the core level spectrum of graphene, showing that it leads to a large
broadening of the C 1s peak. Confirming a decade-old prediction, the broadening
is found to be caused by an exchange of energy and momentum between the
photoemitted core electron and the hot electron system, rather than by
vibrational excitations. This interpretation is supported by a line shape
analysis that accounts for the presence of the excited electrons. Fitting the
spectra to this model directly yields the electronic temperature of the system,
in agreement with electronic temperature values obtained from valence band
data. Furthermore, making use of time- and momentum-resolved C 1s spectra, we
illustrate how the momentum change of the outgoing core electrons leads to a
small but detectable change in the time-resolved photoelectron diffraction
pattern and to a nearly complete elimination of the core level binding energy
variation associated with the narrow $\sigma$-band in the C 1s state. The
results demonstrate that the XPS line shape can be used as an element-specific

been experimentally shown that HOE can obtain representations of hierarchical

hyperbolic space's exponential growth property. However, its theoretical
analysis has been limited to ideal noiseless settings, and its generalization
error in compensation for hyperbolic space's exponential representation ability

bound derivations for ordinal embedding based on the Gramian matrix do not work

through our novel characterization of HOE with decomposed Lorentz Gramian

unidirectional convolution to capture short-term periodic temporal dependencies

hand-crafted interactions is effective for a small number of datasets, it
generally requires laborious and tedious architecture engineering for extensive

have been proposed for designing interactions automatically. However, existing
methods only explore limited types and connections of operators for interaction
generation, leading to low generalization ability. To address these problems,
we propose a more general automated method for building powerful interactions
named AutoPI. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: AutoPI
adopts a more general search space in which the computational graph is
generalized from existing network connections, and the interactive operators in
the edges of the graph are extracted from representative hand-crafted works. It
allows searching for various powerful feature interactions to produce higher
AUC and lower Logloss in a wide variety of applications. Besides, AutoPI
utilizes a gradient-based search strategy for exploration with a significantly
low computational cost. Experimentally, we evaluate AutoPI on a diverse suite
of benchmark datasets, demonstrating the generalizability and efficiency of
AutoPI over hand-crafted architectures and state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.

retain some semblance of an atmosphere. Understanding whether this atmosphere
exists and its composition will be vital for understanding how the atmospheres
of terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs evolve. We observe five transits of GJ
1132b with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
We find a featureless transmission spectrum from 1.1--1.7 microns, ruling out
cloud-free atmospheres with metallicities <300x Solar with >4.8$\sigma$
confidence. We combine our WFC3 results with transit depths from TESS and
archival broadband and spectroscopic observations to find a featureless
spectrum from 0.7--4.5 microns. GJ 1132b has a high mean molecular weight
atmosphere, possesses a high-altitude aerosol layer, or has effectively no
atmosphere. Higher precision observations are required to differentiate between
these possibilities. We explore the impact of hot and cold starspots on the
observed transmission spectrum GJ 1132b, quantifying the amplitude of
spot-induced transit depth features. Using a simple Poisson model we estimate
spot temperature contrasts, spot covering fractions, and spot sizes for GJ
1132. These limits, and the modeling framework, may be useful for future
observations of GJ 1132b or other planets transiting similarly inactive M
dwarfs.

the work presented in this paper is to develop a deep-learning-based system

methodological core of this work is a patch-wise predictive model based on
convolutional neural networks able to determine the presence of cancerous
patterns. In particular, we train from scratch a simple self-design
architecture. The cribriform pattern is detected by retraining the set of
filters of the last convolutional layer in the network. From the reconstructed
prediction map, we compute the percentage of each Gleason grade in the tissue
to feed a multi-layer perceptron which provides a biopsy-level score.mIn our
SICAPv2 database, composed of 182 annotated whole slide images, we obtained a
Cohen's quadratic kappa of 0.77 in the test set for the patch-level Gleason
grading with the proposed architecture trained from scratch. Our results
outperform previous ones reported in the literature. Furthermore, this model
reaches the level of fine-tuned state-of-the-art architectures in a
patient-based four groups cross validation. In the cribriform pattern detection
task, we obtained an area under ROC curve of 0.82. Regarding the biopsy Gleason
scoring, we achieved a quadratic Cohen's Kappa of 0.81 in the test subset.
Shallow CNN architectures trained from scratch outperform current

slow-roll inflation while solving the strong CP problem through the
Peccei-Quinn mechanism. If the cancellation between contributions from a
small-size instanton and another Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking occurs with
high accuracy, the potential can be flattened enough near its maximum to
achieve hilltop inflation. This comes at the cost of severe fine-tuning of
their relative size and phase, but it also allows us to relate the high quality
problem of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry to the fine-tuning problem of the hilltop
inflation. There are two classes of such axion hilltop inflation, each giving a
different relation between the axion mass at the minimum and the decay
constant. The first class predicts the relation $m_\phi \sim 10^{-6}f_\phi$,
and the axion can decay via the gluon coupling and reheat the universe. Most of
the predicted parameter region will be covered by various experiments such as
CODEX, DUNE, FASER, LHC, MATHUSLA, and NA62 where the production and decay
proceed through the same coupling that induced reheating. The second class
predicts the relation $m_\phi \sim 10^{-6} f^2_\phi/ M_{\rm pl}$. In this case,
the axion mass is much lighter than in the previous case, and one needs another
mechanism for successful reheating. The viable decay constant is restricted to
be $10^8{\rm GeV} \lesssim f_\phi \lesssim 10^{10}\,$GeV, which will be probed
by future experiments on the electric dipole moment of nucleons. In both cases,
requiring the axion hilltop inflation results in the strong CP phase that is

intriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe
occlusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.
(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local

CNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate
shape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,
previously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape
representation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic

simulation of topological insulators using lattice-trapped ultracold polar

represents a three-dimensional topological state of matter existing outside the
conventional tenfold way and crystalline-symmetry-based classifications of
topological insulators. Its topology is protected by a \emph{linking number}
invariant, which necessitates long-range spin-orbit coupled hoppings for its
realization. While these ingredients have so far precluded its realization in
solid state systems and other quantum simulation architectures, in a companion
manuscript [1901.08597] we predict that Hopf insulators can in fact arise
naturally in dipolar interacting systems. Here, we investigate a specific such
architecture in lattices of polar molecules, where the effective `spin' is
formed from sublattice degrees of freedom. We introduce two techniques that
allow one to optimize dipolar Hopf insulators with large band gaps, and which
should also be readily applicable to the simulation of other exotic
bandstructures. First, we describe the use of Floquet engineering to control
the range and functional form of dipolar hoppings and second, we demonstrate
that molecular AC polarizabilities (under circularly polarized light) can be
used to precisely tune the resonance condition between different rotational
states. To verify that this latter technique is amenable to current generation
experiments, we calculate from first principles the AC polarizability for
$\sigma^+$ light for ${}^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb. Finally, we show that experiments are
capable of detecting the unconventional topology of the Hopf insulator by
varying the termination of the lattice at its edges, which gives rise to three
distinct classes of edge mode spectra.

cannot distinguish hierarchical population ages of halo or disk structures with

for regions that emit non-thermal radio and gamma rays. Additionally, we model
the spectra of primary electrons, accelerated by supernova remnants, and
secondary electrons and positrons produced in hadronic CR proton interactions
with the gas. We find that proton spectra above 10 GeV only weakly depend on
galactic radius, while they acquire a radial dependence at lower energies due
to Coulomb interactions. Radiative losses steepen the spectra of primary CR
electrons in the central galactic regions while diffusive losses dominate in
the outskirts. Secondary electrons exhibit a steeper spectrum than primaries
because they originate from the transported steeper CR proton spectra.
Consistent with Voyager-1 and AMS-02 data, our models (i) show a turn-over of
proton spectra below GeV energies due to Coulomb interactions so that electrons
start to dominate the total particle spectra and (ii) match the shape of the
positron fraction up to 10 GeV. We conclude that our steady-state CR modeling

evolving at those times. We use radiative transfer simulations to explore the
implications for reionization, with a focus on the short value of
$\lambda_{912}^{\rm mfp} = 3.57^{+3.09}_{-2.14}$ cMpc/$h$ at $z=6$. We
introduce a model for sub-resolution ionizing photon sinks based on radiative
hydrodynamics simulations of small-scale IGM clumping. We argue that the rapid
evolution in $\lambda_{912}^{\rm mfp}$ at $z=5-6$, together with constraints on
the metagalactic ionizing background, favors a late reionization process in
which the neutral fraction evolved rapidly in the latter half. We also argue
that the short $\lambda_{912}^{\rm mfp}(z=6)$ points to faint galaxies as the
primary drivers of reionizaton. Our preferred model, with $\lambda_{912}^{\rm
mfp}(z=6) = 6.5$ Mpc/$h$, has a midpoint of $z= 7.1$ and ends at $z= 5.1$. It
requires 3 ionizing photons per H atom to complete reionization and a LyC
photon production efficiency of $\log(f^{\rm eff}_{\rm esc} \xi_{\rm
ion}/[\mathrm{erg}^{-1} \mathrm{Hz}]) = 24.8$ at $z>6$. Recovering
$\lambda_{912}^{\rm mfp}(z=6)$ as low as the measured central value may require
an increase in IGM clumpiness beyond predictions from simulations, with a
commensurate increase in the photon budget.

an envelope C/O ratio robustly greater than 0.60, even when taking into account

the Universe. Reionization has generally been assumed to be limited primarily
by the rate at which galaxies produce ionizing photons, but the recent
measurement of a surprisingly short ionizing photon mean free path of
$0.75^{+0.65}_{-0.45}$ proper Mpc at $z = 6$ by Becker et al. (2021) suggests
that absorption by residual neutral hydrogen in the otherwise ionized
intergalactic medium may play a much larger role than previously expected. Here
we show that consistency between this short mean free path and the coeval dark
pixel fraction in the Ly$\alpha$ forest requires a cumulative output of
$6.1^{+11}_{-2.4}$ ionizing photons per baryon by reionization's end. This
represents a dramatic increase in the ionizing photon budget over previous
estimates, greatly exacerbating the tension with measurements of the ionizing
output from galaxies at later times. Translating this constraint into the
instantaneous ionizing production from galaxies in our model, we find
$\log_{10}f_{\rm esc}\xi_{\rm ion}/\text{(erg/Hz)}^{-1} =25.02_{-0.21}^{+0.45}$
at $z\sim6$. Even with optimistic assumptions about the ionizing production
efficiency of early stellar populations, and assuming the galaxy luminosity
function extends to extremely faint sources ($M_{\text{UV}}\leq-11$), complete
reionization requires the escape fraction of ionizing photons to exceed $20\%$
across the galaxy population. This is far larger than observed in any galaxy
population at lower redshifts, requiring rapid evolution in galaxy properties
after the first billion years of cosmic time. This tension cannot be completely
relieved within existing observational constraints on the hydrogen neutral

energy implemented by quintessence fields in Einstein gravity, using the
Einstein frame-Jordan frame duality. For a family of viable quintessence

of viable quintessence models, the Jordan frame universe grows to a maximum
finite size, after which it begins to collapse back. Thus, there is a
possibility that in the late time limit where the Einstein frame universe
continues to expand, the Jordan frame universe collapses. The condition for
this expansion-collapse duality is then generalized to time varying equations
of state models, taking into account the presence of non-relativistic matter or

seismic disturbances, generally making it difficult to model noise couplings.
Hence, typically time periods containing glitches are vetoed to mitigate the

both model and unmodeled GW signals, we present a new machine learning based
method which uses on-site sensors/system-controls monitoring the instrumental

the ac driving direction. When the ac drive is parallel to the funnel axis, the
skyrmion flows in the easy direction and its average velocity is quantized. In
contrast, when the ac drive is perpendicular to the funnel axis, a
Magnus-induced ratchet effect occurs, and the skyrmion moves along the hard
direction with a constant average velocity. For biharmonic ac driving of equal

simulate custom processes through the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework. The pipeline
includes a first stage where the analytic expressions for matrix elements and
phase space are generated and exported in a GPU-like format. The simulation is
then performed using the VegasFlow and PDFFlow libraries which deploy
automatically the full simulation on systems with different hardware
acceleration capabilities, such as multi-threading CPU, single-GPU and
multi-GPU setups. We show some preliminary results for leading-order
simulations on different hardware configurations.

way of channel pruning for the deployment of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) under hardware constraints. To fulfill the searching, a one-shot
supernet is usually leveraged to efficiently evaluate the performance
\wrt~different network widths. However, current methods mainly follow a
\textit{unilaterally augmented} (UA) principle for the evaluation of each
width, which induces the training unfairness of channels in supernet. In this
paper, we introduce a new supernet called Bilaterally Coupled Network (BCNet)
to address this issue. In BCNet, each channel is fairly trained and responsible
for the same amount of network widths, thus each network width can be evaluated
more accurately. Besides, we leverage a stochastic complementary strategy for
training the BCNet, and propose a prior initial population sampling method to
boost the performance of the evolutionary search. Extensive experiments on
benchmark CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets indicate that our method can achieve
state-of-the-art or competing performance over other baseline methods.
Moreover, our method turns out to further boost the performance of NAS models
by refining their network widths. For example, with the same FLOPs budget, our
obtained EfficientNet-B0 achieves 77.36\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset,
surpassing the performance of original setting by 0.48\%.

regularized Ising formulation for MIMO detection that mitigates a common error

However, the simplified detection in these systems comes at the cost of overall
throughput, which could be improved by supporting more users. By means of
numerical simulations, we show that in principle a MIMO detector based on a
hybrid use of a CIM would allow us to add more transmitter antennas/users and
increase the overall throughput of the cell by a significant factor. This would
open up the opportunity to operate using more aggressive modulation and coding

of this perhaps unintuitive outcome is that today's buffer sharing techniques

spatial unit. The size of the spatial unit--or spatial scale--that is most
appropriate for a particular health outcome is unknown and its choice
inextricably impacts the estimated health effect. A related issue is the lack
of knowledge of the temporal scale--or the length of exposure time that is
necessary for the BEF to render its full effect on the health outcome. The
proposed STAP model enables investigators to estimate both the spatial and
temporal scales for a given BEF in a data-driven fashion, thereby providing a
flexible solution for measuring the relationship between outcomes and spatial
proximity to point-referenced exposures. Simulation studies verify the validity

measurements. This paper describes a program which generates bremsstrahlung
photons in electron-proton and electron-ion interactions as well as scattered
electrons in bremsstrahlung processes and in a quasi-real photon approximation

presence of a generic non-minimal coupling (to gravity) term. That term allows
us to use the functional freedom it brings to the inflationary Lagrangian as an
effective Planck mass. In this sense, we argue one should consider the initial
field value of the effective Planck mass for the TCC. We show that as a result,
one can remove the TCC upper bounds without the need to produce a new process

of epidemic dynamics. Although collective activity can be modified through
imposed measures to control epidemic progression, spontaneous changes can also
arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk
of contagion. Here we introduce a stochastic epidemic model that implements
population responses driven by individual- and time-dependent risk-taking
propensity. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of
multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude without the need to consider
external modulation of parameters. Successive waves tune the effective
reproduction number to its critical value $R=1$. This process is a consequence
of the interplay of the fractions of susceptible and infected population and
the average risk-taking propensity, as shown by a mean-field approach. The
proposed mechanism also shows how, under the threat of contagion, the
distribution of individual risk propensities evolves towards a well-defined
profile. Successive waves trigger selective sweeps of risk-taking propensity at
a pace determined by individual risk reaction rates. This kind of collective,
self-generated pressure, may therefore shape risk-aversion profiles associated
to epidemics in human groups. The final state is self-organized and generic,
independent of the parameter values. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in
human behavior can, by themselves, explain major qualitative and quantitative
features of the epidemic process, as the emergence of multiple waves and the
tendency to remain around $R=1$ observed worldwide after the first few waves of
COVID-19.

Capillary Relaxation (OSCAR), for efficient Volume-Of-Fluid simulations of

separate the viscous drag and the surface tension forces. Different time-steps
are used for the viscous drag steps, controlled by the injection velocity, and
for the capillary relaxation steps, controlled by the velocity of capillary
waves. Although OSCAR induces an additional numerical error of order 0 in time
resulting from the splitting, it is well suited for simulations at low
capillary number. First, the splitting error decreases with the capillary
number and at low capillary number, the relaxation steps converge before
reaching their last iteration, resulting in a large speed-up (here up to 250x)
compared to standard time-stepping methods. The method is implemented in
GeoChemFoam, our OpenFOAM-based CFD solver. Convergence, accuracy and
efficiency are demonstrated on three benchmark cases: (1) the steady motion of
an air bubble in a straight 2D microchannel, (2) injection of supercritical CO2
in a 3D constricted channel leading to a snap-off, and (3) water drainage in a

the degree of spin-orbit alignment in a binary system, has been widely regarded
as a robust discriminator between the isolated and dynamical formation pathways
for merging binary black holes. Until the recent release of the GWTC-2 catalog,
such tests have yielded inconclusive results due to the small number of events
with measurable nonzero spins. In this work, we study the $\chi_{\rm eff}$
distribution of the binary black holes detected in the LIGO-Virgo O1-O3a

distribution is symmetric about $\chi_{\rm eff} = 0$ and whether the data
provides support for a population of negative-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ systems. We find
that the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution is asymmetric at 95% credibility, with
an excess of aligned-spin binary systems ($\chi_{\rm eff}>0$) over anti-aligned
ones. Moreover, we find that there is no evidence for negative-$\chi_{\rm eff}$
systems in the current population of binary black holes. Thus, based solely on
the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution, dynamical formation is disfavored as being
responsible for the entirety of the observed merging binary black holes, while
isolated formation remains viable. We also study the mass distribution of the
current binary black hole population, confirming that a single truncated power
law distribution in the primary source-frame mass, $m_1^{\rm src}$, fails to
describe the observations. Instead, we find that the preferred models have a
steep feature at $m_1^{\rm src} \sim 40 \,\rm M_\odot$ consistent with a step

extracted from MNIST and CIFAR-10, trained using SGD in a standard way. For
some dataset-architecture pairs, after a few epochs of neural network training,
a hard-margin SVM using the network's after kernel is much more accurate than
when the network's initial kernel is used. For networks with an architecture
similar to VGG, the after kernel is more ""global"", in the sense that it is less
invariant to transformations of input images that disrupt the global structure
of the image while leaving the local statistics largely intact. For fully
connected networks, the after kernel is less global in this sense. The after
kernel tends to be more invariant to small shifts, rotations and zooms; data
augmentation does not improve these invariances. The (finite approximation to
the) conjugate kernel, obtained using the last layer of hidden nodes,
sometimes, but not always, provides a good approximation to the NTK and the
after kernel.
  Training a network with a larger learning rate (while holding the training

purpose that facilitates data-driven decision making by testing hypotheses
about complex effect modifiers in terms of network features or network patterns
(e.g., characteristics of neighbors of a unit or belonging to a triangle), and
by identifying sub-populations for which a treatment is likely to be effective
or harmful. We describe a hypothesis testing approach that accounts for a
unit's covariates, their neighbors' covariates, and patterns in the social
network, and devise an algorithm incorporating ideas from causal inference,
hypothesis testing, and graph theory to verify a hypothesized effect modifier.
In addition, we develop a novel algorithm for the discovery of network patterns
that are potential effect modifiers. We perform extensive experimental
evaluations with a real development economics dataset about the treatment
effect of belonging to a financial support network called self-help groups on
risk tolerance, and also with a synthetic dataset with known ground truths
simulating a vaccine efficacy trial, to evaluate our framework and algorithms.

stability is well-studied, whereas determining how ""globally stable"" a
nonlinear system is very challenging. Over the last few decades, many different
ideas have been developed to address this issue, primarily driven by concrete
applications. In particular, several disciplines suggested a web of concepts
under the headline ""resilience"". Unfortunately, there are many different
variants and explanations of resilience, and often the definitions are left
relatively vague, sometimes even deliberately. Yet, to allow for a structural
development of a mathematical theory of resilience that can be used across
different areas, one has to ensure precise starting definitions and provide a
mathematical comparison of different resilience measures. In this work, we
provide a systematic review of the most relevant indicators of resilience in
the context of continuous dynamical systems, grouped according to their
mathematical features. The indicators are also generalized to be applicable to
any attractor. These steps are important to ensure a more reliable,
quantitatively comparable and reproducible study of resilience in dynamical
systems. Furthermore, we also develop a new concept of resilience against
certain non-autonomous perturbations to demonstrate, how one can naturally
extend our framework. All the indicators are finally compared via the analysis
of a classic scalar model from population dynamics to show that direct
quantitative application-based comparisons are an immediate consequence of a
detailed mathematical analysis.

recognition in radio networks modeled by simple undirected connected graphs.
Size discovery calls for all nodes to output the number of nodes in the graph,
called its size, and in the task of topology recognition each node has to learn
the topology of the graph and its position in it. In radio networks, nodes
communicate in synchronous rounds and start in the same round. In each round a
node can either transmit the same message to all its neighbors, or stay silent
and listen. At the receiving end, a node $v$ hears a message from a neighbor
$w$ in a given round, if $v$ listens in this round, and if $w$ is its only
neighbor that transmits in this round. If more than one neighbor of a node $v$
transmits in a given round, there is a collision at $v$. We do not assume
collision detection: in case of a collision, node $v$ does not hear anything.
The time of a deterministic algorithm for each of the above problems is the
worst-case number of rounds it takes to solve it.
  Our goal is to construct short labeling schemes for size discovery and
topology recognition in arbitrary radio networks, and to design efficient
deterministic algorithms using these schemes. For size discovery, we construct
a labeling scheme of length $O(\log\log\Delta)$ and we design an algorithm for
this problem using this scheme and working in time $O(\log^2 n)$, where $n$ is
the size of the graph. We also show that time complexity $O(\log^2 n)$ is
optimal for the problem of size discovery, whenever the labeling scheme is of
optimal length. For topology recognition, we construct a labeling scheme of
length $O(\log\Delta)$, and we design an algorithm for this problem using this
scheme working in time $O\left(D\Delta+\min(\Delta^2,n)\right)$. We also show
that the length of our labeling scheme is asymptotically optimal.

$10U_p$ for electron emission and $3.17U_p$ for high harmonic generation is
applicable for ponderomotive amplitudes ($\propto E\lambda^2$) much smaller
than the field drop-off scale. For large wavelength and high field experiments
at nanoscale structures this assumption may break down by predicting energies
beyond the true classical energy limits. Here we provide generalized
calculations for these cutoff energies by taking into account the spatial field
drop-off. The modified cutoff energies vary significantly from the uniform
field results even with ponderomotive amplitudes still an order of magnitude
below the field drop-off scale. Electron emission and scattering energy as a
function of the time-of-ionization is considered for the nanotip ($\sim1/r^2$)
field profile. The cutoff energies as a function of the adiabaticity parameter
$\delta$, which may be easily calculated for given wavelength, apex field
strength, and nanostructure scale, are then determined through maximization for
nanotip, nanoblade ($\sim1/r$), and exponential field profiles. These profiles
deviate from each other in electron emission energy by up to nearly a factor of
the ponderomotive energy, indicating the importance of mid-field profile
behavior. The electron emission energy cutoff also attains an additional factor
of $U_p$ due to the smooth integrated ponderomotive force in the adiabatic
drop-off and very long pulse regime. These results also provided as
double-exponential fits for ease of use. We then compare the nanoblade electron
emission cutoffs with a quantum simulation of the electron rescattering
process. We also consider a short (few-cycle) pulsed field, focusing on a
cosine-like pulse and overviewing the general carrier-envelope phase
dependencies.

the first one propagated relatively self-similarly, while the second one

absence of large-scale corotating structures in the ICME propagation space
between Mercury and 1 AU, that have been shown to influence the orientation of
ICME magnetic structures and the properties of ICME sheaths. We determine the
flux rope orientation at the two locations using force-free flux rope fits as
well as the classification by Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2019). We also use
measurements of plasma properties at 1 AU, the size evolution of the sheaths
and ME with heliocentric distance, and identification of structures in the
propagation space based on in situ data, remote-sensing observations, and
simulations of the steady-state solar wind, to complement our analysis. Results
indicate that the changes observed in one ICME were likely caused by a stream
interaction region, while the ICME exhibiting little change did not interact
with any transients between Mercury and 1 AU. This work provides an example of
how interactions with corotating structures in the solar wind can induce
fundamental changes in ICMEs. Our findings can help lay the foundation for
improved predictions of ICME properties at 1 AU.

studied as a function of system parameters from the weakly interacting BCS
regime to the strongly interacting unitary regime. The normal modes were
obtained previously from a first-order L=0 group theoretic solution of a
three-dimensional Hamiltonian with a general two-body interaction for confined,
identical particles. In a precursor to this study, the collective behavior of
these normal modes was investigated as a function of N from few-body systems to
many-body systems analyzing the contribution of individual particles to the
collective macroscopic motions. A specific case, the Hamiltonian for Fermi
gases in the unitary regime was studied in more detail. This regime is known to
support collective behavior in the form of superfluidity and has previously
been successfully described using normal modes. Two phenomena that could
sustain the emergence and stability of superfluid behavior were revealed,
including the behavior of the normal mode frequencies as N increases. In this
paper, I focus on a more detailed analysis of these analytic frequencies,
extending my investigation to include Hamiltonians with a range of
interparticle interaction strengths from the BCS regime to the unitary regime
and analyzing the microscopic dynamics that lead to large gaps at unitarity.
The results of the current study suggest that in regimes where higher-order
effects are small, normal modes an be used to describe the physics of
superfluidity from the weakly interacting BCS regime with the emergence of
small excitation gaps to unitarity with its large gaps, and can offer insight
into a possible microscopic understanding of the behavior at unitarity. This
approach could thus offer an alternative to the two-body pairing models

This paper reviews the history, key engineering issues, and selected scientific
achievements of the Subaru Telescope. The active optics for a thin primary
mirror was the design backbone of the telescope to deliver a high-imaging
performance. Adaptive optics with a laser-facility to generate an artificial
guide-star improved the telescope vision to its diffraction limit by cancelling
any atmospheric turbulence effect in real time. Various observational
instruments, especially the wide-field camera, have enabled unique
observational studies. Selected scientific topics include studies on cosmic
reionization, weak/strong gravitational lensing, cosmological parameters,
primordial black holes, the dynamical/chemical evolution/interactions of
galaxies, neutron star mergers, supernovae, exoplanets, proto-planetary disks,
and outliers of the solar system. The last described are operational

promises for thermal management and heat harvesting applications. Predicting
the effect that nanostructuring has on thermal conductivity requires models,
such as the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), that capture the non-diffusive
transport of phonons. Although the BTE has been well validated against several
key experiments, notably those on nanoporous materials, its applicability is
computationally expensive. Several effective model theories have been put
forward to estimate the effective thermal conductivity; however, most of them
are either based on simple geometries, e.g., thin films, or simplified material
descriptions such as the gray-model approximation. To fill this gap, we propose
a model that takes into account the whole mean-free-path (MFP) distribution as
well as the complexity of the material's boundaries in infinitely thick films
with extruded porosity using uniparameter logistic regression. We validate our
approach, which is called the ""Ballistic Correction Model"" (BCM), against full
BTE simulations of a selection of three base materials (GaAs, InAs, and Si)
with nanoscale porosity, obtaining excellent agreement. While the key
parameters of our method, associated with the geometry of the bulk material,
are obtained from the BTE, they can be decoupled and used in arbitrary
combinations and scales. We tabulated these parameters for a few cases,
enabling the exploration of systems that are beyond those considered in this

nanostructures, our work sets out to accelerate the discovery of materials for

routing and measurement operations by storing a compressed representation of a
set. Filters are space efficient, but can make bounded one-sided errors: with
tunable probability epsilon, they may report that a query element is stored in
the filter when it is not. This is called a false positive. Recent research has
focused on designing methods for dynamically adapting filters to false
positives, reducing the number of false positives when some elements are
queried repeatedly.
  Ideally, an adaptive filter would incur a false positive with bounded
probability epsilon for each new query element, and would incur o(epsilon)
total false positives over all repeated queries to that element. We call such a
filter support optimal.
  In this paper we design a new Adaptive Cuckoo Filter and show that it is
support optimal (up to additive logarithmic terms) over any n queries when
storing a set of size n. Our filter is simple: fixing previous false positives
requires a simple cuckoo operation, and the filter does not need to store any
additional metadata. This data structure is the first practical data structure
that is support optimal, and the first filter that does not require additional
space to fix false positives.
  We complement these bounds with experiments showing that our data structure
is effective at fixing false positives on network traces, outperforming
previous Adaptive Cuckoo Filters.
  Finally, we investigate adversarial adaptivity, a stronger notion of
adaptivity in which an adaptive adversary repeatedly queries the filter, using
the result of previous queries to drive the false positive rate as high as
possible. We prove a lower bound showing that a broad family of filters,
including all known Adaptive Cuckoo Filters, can be forced by such an adversary
to incur a large number of false positives.

feasibility constraints. (ii) We allow the blocking time of each arm to be
stochastic. We first study the computational/unconditional hardness of the
above setting and identify the necessary conditions for the problem to become
tractable (even in an approximate sense). Based on these conditions, we provide
a tight analysis of the approximation guarantee of a natural greedy heuristic

available (non-blocked) arms. When the arms' expected rewards are unknown, we
adapt the above heuristic into a bandit algorithm, based on UCB, for which we
provide sublinear (approximate) regret guarantees, matching the theoretical

learning (MARL) framework to simultaneously localize multiple SPs in 3D US. Our
contribution is four-fold. First, our proposed method is general and it can
accurately localize multiple SPs in different challenging US datasets. Second,
we equip the MARL system with a recurrent neural network (RNN) based
collaborative module, which can strengthen the communication among agents and
learn the spatial relationship among planes effectively. Third, we explore to
adopt the neural architecture search (NAS) to automatically design the network
architecture of both the agents and the collaborative module. Last, we believe
we are the first to realize automatic SP localization in pelvic US volumes, and
note that our approach can handle both normal and abnormal uterus cases.
Extensively validated on two challenging datasets of the uterus and fetal

Galactic Dynamics. Since these two areas are vast and not recent, each one has
already been covered separately by several reviews. After a general historical
introduction, and a needed quick review of processes like the stellar
nucleosynthesis which gives the base to understand the interstellar formation
of simple chemical compounds (H2, CO, NH3 and H2O), we focus on a number of
topics which are at the crossing of the two areas, Dynamics and Astrochemistry.
Astrochemistry is a flourishing field which intends to study the presence and
formation of molecules as well as the influence of them into the structure,
evolution and dynamics of astronomical objects. The progress in the knowledge
on the existence of new complex molecules and of their process of formation
originates from the observational, experimental and theoretical areas which
compose the field. The interfacing areas include star formation, protoplanetary
disks, the role of the spiral arms and the chemical abundance gradients in the
galactic disk. It often happens that the physical conditions in some regions of
the ISM are only revealed by means of molecular observations. To organise a
classification of chemical evolution processes, we discuss about how
astrochemistry can act in three different contexts: i. the chemistry of the
early universe, including external galaxies, ii. star forming regions, and iii.
AGB stars and circumstellar envelopes. We mention that our research is
stimulated by plans for instruments and projects, such as the on-going LLAMA,
which consists in the construction of a 12m sub-mm radio telescope in the
Andes. Thus, modern and new facilities can play a key role in new discoveries
not only in astrochemistry but also in radio astronomy and related areas.

  local interactions",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffusion of atoms in solids is one of the most fundamental kinetic processes
that ultimately governs many materials properties. Here, we report on a
combined first-principles and kinetic Monte Carlo study of macroscopic
diffusion properties of disordered Ti-Ta alloys over the entire composition
range. Using simple cluster expansion model Hamiltonians parametrized on
density functional theory data, we compute transport properties explicitly
including local interactions between the two atomic species and compare them
with the non-interacting diffusion model for disordered, random alloys.
Surprisingly, we find that although these alloys thermodynamically behave as
nearly random solid solutions, their kinetic properties deviate significantly
from the behavior predicted by diffusion models for non-interacting systems. We
attribute these differences in transport properties to the local interactions
that create a rather corrugated potential energy landscape and consequently
give rise to energetically non-degenerate end-states of diffusion processes
which cannot be realized in a non-interacting disordered or other simpler
diffusion models. The findings emphasize the limitations of the widely known
non-interacting disordered diffusion model for such systems. Furthermore, we
explain that changes in mobility in these alloys is predominantly due to
changes in the correlation factor caused by the local interactions. Our work
thus highlights the importance of explicitly including local interactions when
assessing the transport properties of thermodynamically nearly disordered
alloys.

Thus, the size and number of contractions are critical in recovering for loss

fairness, and diversity), but ignore the true reason for bias amplification and
trade-off the recommendation accuracy.
  In this work, we scrutinize the cause-effect factors for bias amplification,
identifying the main reason lies in the confounder effect of imbalanced item
distribution on user representation and prediction score. The existence of such
confounder pushes us to go beyond merely modeling the conditional probability
and embrace the causal modeling for recommendation. Towards this end, we
propose a Deconfounded Recommender System (DecRS), which models the causal
effect of user representation on the prediction score. The key to eliminating
the impact of the confounder lies in backdoor adjustment, which is however
difficult to do due to the infinite sample space of the confounder. For this
challenge, we contribute an approximation operator for backdoor adjustment
which can be easily plugged into most recommender models. Lastly, we devise an
inference strategy to dynamically regulate backdoor adjustment according to
user status. We instantiate DecRS on two representative models FM and NFM, and
conduct extensive experiments over two benchmarks to validate the superiority
of our proposed DecRS.

equation that incorporates spatial radiation dose distribution as a

encoder-decoder-based convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and
trained to learn the proposed biological model. As such, the model could
generate post-radiation FDG-PET image outcome predictions with possible
time-series transition from pre-radiotherapy image states to post-radiotherapy
states. The proposed method was developed using 64 oropharyngeal patients with
paired FDG-PET studies before and after 20Gy delivery (2Gy/daily fraction) by
IMRT. In a two-branch deep learning execution, the proposed CNN learns specific
terms in the biological model from paired FDG-PET images and spatial dose
distribution as in one branch, and the biological model generates post-20Gy
FDG-PET image prediction in the other branch. The proposed method successfully
generated post-20Gy FDG-PET image outcome prediction with breakdown
illustrations of biological model components. Time-series FDG-PET image
predictions were generated to demonstrate the feasibility of disease response
rendering. The developed biologically guided deep learning method achieved
post-20Gy FDG-PET image outcome predictions in good agreement with ground-truth
results. With break-down biological modeling components, the outcome image
predictions could be used in adaptive radiotherapy decision-making to optimize
personalized plans for the best outcome in the future.

sensor measurements whose joint probability density function (p.d.f.) depends
on a private parameter. To ensure parameter privacy, we propose a filter design
framework which consists of two components: a randomizer and a nonlinear
transformation. The randomizer takes the private parameter as input and
randomly generates a pseudo parameter. The nonlinear mapping transforms the
measurements such that the joint p.d.f. of the filter's output depends on the
pseudo parameter rather than the private parameter. It also ensures that the
joint p.d.f. of the filter's output belongs to the same family of distributions
as that of the measurements. The nonlinear transformation has a
feedforward-feedback structure that allows real-time and causal generation of
the disguised measurements with low complexity using a recursive structure. The
design of the randomizer is formulated as an optimization problem subject to a
privacy constraint, in terms of mutual information, and it is shown that the
optimal randomizer is the solution of a convex optimization problem. Using
information-theoretic inequalities, we show that the performance of any
estimator of the private parameter, based on the output of the privacy filter,
is limited by the privacy constraint. The structure of the nonlinear
transformation is studied in the special cases of independent and identically
distributed, Markovian, and Gauss-Markov measurements. Our results show that
the privacy filter in the Gauss-Markov case can be implemented as two one-step

alters its state. In this work, the impacts of two diagnostic schemes to
determine the performance of quantum Otto heat engines are compared: In one
scheme, the energy of the engine's working substance is measured after each
stroke (repeated measurements), and in the other one, the energies after each
stroke are recorded in one or two pointer states and measured only after the
completion of a prescribed number of cycles (repeated contacts). A single
pointer state suffices if one is only interested in either work or heat. For
joint work and heat diagnostics, two pointers are needed. These schemes are
applied to Otto engines, whose working substance consists of a two-level
system. Depending on the engine protocol, the duration of a single cycle may be
infinite or finite. Because in the repeated contact scheme, the number of
measurements is drastically reduced compared to the repeated measurement
scheme, the quantum coherence after and during the contact diagnostics is much
better maintained than repeated measurements that destroy any coherence at the
end of each stroke. We demonstrate that maximum power, reliability, and
efficiency of the engine in the presence of repeated contacts typically
outperform these figures of merit of repeated measurements. Due to the improved
coherence persistence, heat engines with a finite cycle duration require a
larger number of cycles to reach a periodically asymptotic state. Overall, our
results document the importance of taking into account the particular nature of
diagnostic tools for monitoring and testing purposes but also for feedback
control, both in theory and experiment.

edit automata to enforce controllers represented in Hennessy and Regan's Timed
Process Language. We define a synthesis algorithm that, given an alphabet $P$
of observable actions and a timed correctness property $e$, returns a monitor
that enforces the property $e$ during the execution of any (potentially
corrupted) controller with alphabet $P$, and complying with the property $e$.
Our monitors correct and suppress incorrect actions coming from corrupted
controllers and emit actions in full autonomy when the controller under
scrutiny is not able to do so in a correct manner. Besides classical
requirements, such as transparency and soundness, the proposed enforcement
enjoys deadlock- and diverge-freedom of monitored controllers, together with
scalability when dealing with networks of controllers. Finally, we test the
proposed enforcement mechanism on a non-trivial case study, taken from the
context of industrial water treatment systems, in which the controllers are
injected with different malware with different malicious goals.

lunar surface using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Continuous
investigation on the dielectric constant of the lunar surface is a high
priority task due to future lunar mission's goals and possible exploration of
human outposts. For this purpose, derived anisotropy and backscattering
coefficients of SAR images are used. The SAR images are obtained from Miniature

These images are available in the form of Stokes parameters, which are used to
derive the coherency matrix. The derived coherency matrix is further
represented in terms of particle anisotropy. This coherency matrix's elements
compared with Cloud's coherency matrix, which results in the new relationship
between particle anisotropy and coherency matrix elements (backscattering
coefficients). Following this, estimated anisotropy is used to determine the
dielectric constant. Our model estimates the dielectric constant of the lunar
surface without parallax error. The produce results are also comparable with
the earlier estimate. As an advantageous, our method estimates the dielectric
constant without any apriori information about the density or composition of
lunar surface materials. The proposed approach can also be useful for
determining the dielectric properties of Mars and other celestial bodies.

on-chip implementation of a large-scale neural network is still challenging
owing to its low scalability. Herein, we propose the concept of a photonic
neural field and implement it experimentally on a silicon chip to realize
highly scalable neuro-inspired computing. In contrast to existing photonic
neural networks, the photonic neural field is a spatially continuous field that
nonlinearly responds to optical inputs, and its high spatial degrees of freedom
allow for large-scale and high-density neural processing on a millimeter-scale
chip. In this study, we use the on-chip photonic neural field as a reservoir of
information and demonstrate a high-speed chaotic time-series prediction with
low errors using a training approach similar to reservoir computing. We discuss
that the photonic neural field is potentially capable of executing more than
one peta multiply-accumulate operations per second for a single input
wavelength on a footprint as small as a few square millimeters. In addition to
processing, the photonic neural field can be used for rapidly sensing the
temporal variation of an optical phase, facilitated by its high sensitivity to
optical inputs. The merging of optical processing with optical sensing paves
the way for an end-to-end data-driven optical sensing scheme.

understand the neuronal population dynamics that underlie phase entrainment of
brain oscillations by external stimuli, which is used for therapeutic treatment
in neurological disorders, for example in Parkinsonian tremor. Yet, the
neuronal dynamics underpinning such entrainment is not fully understood.
Rhythmic sensory stimulation is one way of studying phase synchronization in
the brain. A recent experimental study has reported phase entrainment of brain
oscillations during steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), which are
scalp electroencephalogram corresponding to periodic stimuli. We have simulated
SSVEP-like signals corresponding to periodic pulse input to our in silico
model. We have used phase locking values, normalised Shannon entropy and
conditional probability as synchronisation indices to show phase synchrony in
the neuronal populations. Our experiment demonstrates that the phase
synchronisation disappears with jitter in the input inter-pulse intervals, and
this would not be the case if the output signal were to be the superposition of
the responses to the different input signals. Thus, the phase synchronisation
implies entrainment of the network response by the periodic input. Overall, our
study shows the plausibility of using biologically inspired in silico models,
validated by experimental works, to understand and make testable predictions on
brain entrainment as a therapeutic treatment in specific neurological
disorders.

infeasible states. Furthermore, the trained multiplier net can indicate whether
a given state is feasible or not through the statewise complementary slackness

wide variety of safety-critical systems. A critical intermediate step in the
formally certified compilation of LUSTRE involves translation to a well-behaved
sub-language called ""Normalised LUSTRE"" (NLUSTRE). Recently, we proposed a
simple Denning-style lattice-based secure information flow type system for
NLUSTRE, and proved its soundness by establishing that security-typed programs
are non-interfering with respect to the co-inductive stream semantics.
  In this paper, we propose a similar security type system for unrestricted
LUSTRE, and show that Bourke et al.'s semantics-preserving normalisation
transformations from LUSTRE to NLUSTRE are security-preserving as well. A
novelty is the use of refinement security types for node calls. The main result
is the preservation of security types by the normalisation transformations. The
soundness of our security typing rules is shown by establishing that
well-security-typed programs are non-interfering, via a reduction to
type-preservation (here), semantics-preservation (Bourke et al.) and our
previous result of non-interference for NLUSTRE.

Reordering buffers has many potential applications in computer sciences and

  Ground Robots in Agriculture","Accepted for publication in Field Robotics",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Achieving long-term autonomy for mobile robots operating in real-world
unstructured environments such as farms remains a significant challenge. This
is made increasingly complex in the presence of moving humans or livestock.
These environments require a robot to be adaptive in its immediate plans,
accounting for the state of nearby individuals and the response that they might
have to the robot's actions. Additionally, in order to achieve longer-term
goals, consideration of the limited on-board resources available to the robot
is required, especially for extended missions such as weeding an agricultural
field. To achieve efficient long-term autonomy, it is thus crucial to
understand the impact that online dynamic updates to an energy efficient
offline plan might have on resource usage whilst navigating through crowds or
herds. To address these challenges, a hierarchical planning framework is
proposed, integrating an online local dynamic path planner with an offline
longer-term objective-based planner. This framework acts to achieve long-term
autonomy through awareness of both dynamic responses of individuals to a
robot's motion and the limited resources available. This paper details the
hierarchical approach and its integration on a robotic platform, including a
comprehensive description of the planning framework and associated perception
modules. The approach is evaluated in real-world trials on farms, requiring
both consideration of limited battery capacity and the presence of nearby
moving individuals. These trials additionally demonstrate the ability of the
framework to adapt resource use through variation of the local dynamic planner,
allowing adaptive behaviour in changing environments. A summary video is

diagrams consisting of multiple long-range ordered phases. Field-driven
metamagnetic transitions between them may depend not only on the magnitude, but
also on the direction of the applied magnetic field. Examples of such behavior
are plentiful among rare-earth borides, such as RB$_6$ or RB$_{12}$ ($R$ = rare
earth). In this work, for example, we use torque magnetometry to measure
anisotropic field-angular phase diagrams of La-doped cerium hexaborides,
Ce$_{1-x}$La$_x$B$_6$ ($x$ = 0, 0.18, 0.28, 0.5). One expects that
field-directional anisotropy of phase transitions must be impossible to
understand without knowing the magnetic structures of the corresponding
competing phases and being able to evaluate their precise thermodynamic energy
balance. However, this task is usually beyond the reach of available
theoretical approaches, because the ordered phases can be noncollinear, possess
large magnetic unit cells, involve higher-order multipoles of 4f ions rather
than simple dipoles, or just lack sufficient microscopic characterization. Here
we demonstrate that the anisotropy under field rotation can be qualitatively
understood on a much more basic level of theory, just by considering the
crystal-electric-field scheme of a pair of rare-earth ions in the lattice,
coupled by a single nearest-neighbor exchange interaction. Transitions between
different crystal-field ground states, calculated using this minimal model for
the parent compound CeB6, possess field-directional anisotropy that strikingly
resembles the experimental phase diagrams. This implies that the anisotropy of
phase transitions is of local origin and is easier to describe than the ordered
phases themselves.

is PPAD-complete. The second is the extreme paucity of models that use cardinal
utilities. Our paper addresses both these issues by proposing
Nash-bargaining-based matching market models. Since the Nash bargaining
solution is captured by a convex program, efficiency follows. In addition, it
possesses several desirable game-theoretic properties. Our approach yields a
rich collection of models: for one-sided as well as two-sided markets, for
Fisher as well as Arrow-Debreu settings, and for a wide range of utility
functions, all the way from linear to Leontief. We give very fast
implementations for these models using Frank-Wolfe and Cutting Plane
algorithms. These help solve large instances with several thousand agents and
goods in a matter of minutes on a PC, even for a one-sided matching market
under piecewise-linear concave utility functions and a two-sided matching
market under linear utility functions. In contrast, using HZ, going beyond even
$n = 10$ is prohibitive. Several new ideas were needed, beyond the standard
methods, to obtain these implementations. In particular, we present several
lower bounding schemes, which not only help improve the convergence of our

strength, while the system favors a ferromagnetic semiconductor state for most

anisotropy, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and orbital character of
valleys enable an intrinsic valley polarization for electrons but not for
holes. This electron valley polarization can be switched by reversing the
magnetization direction, providing a new route of magnetic control of
valleytronics. Our result sheds light on the possible role of correlation
effects in the 2D transition metal compounds, and it will open new perspectives
for spintronic, valleytronic and topological nanoelectronic applications based

for correlated-metal TCO because it has the capability of optimizing the
performance of transparent electrodes by varying ${x}$. Systematic and
significant spectral changes were found near the Fermi level (${E_{\rm F}}$) as
a function of ${x}$, while the overall electronic structure of STVO is in good
agreement with the prediction of band structure calculations. As ${x}$
decreases from 1.0, spectral weight transfer occurs from the coherent band near
${E_{\rm F}}$ to the incoherent states (lower Hubbard band) around 1.0-1.5 eV.
Simultaneously, a pseudogap is formed at ${E_{\rm F}}$, indicating a
significant reduction in quasiparticle spectral weight within close vicinity of
${E_{\rm F}}$. This pseudogap seems to evolve into an energy gap at ${x}$ =
0.4, suggesting the occurrence of a composition-driven metal-insulator
transition. From angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopic results, the
carrier concentration ${n}$ changes proportionally as a function of ${x}$ in
the metallic range of ${x}$ = 0.6-1.0. In contrast, the mass enhancement
factor, which is proportional to the effective mass (${m^*}$), does not change
significantly with varying ${x}$. These results suggest that the key factor of
${n/m^*}$ in optimizing the performance of correlated-metal TCO is tuned by
${x}$, highlighting the potential of STVO to achieve the desired TCO
performance in the metallic region.

test the 3D fundamental plane relation (Dainotti relation) which connects the
prompt peak luminosity, the time at the end of the plateau (rest-frame), and
the luminosity at that time, on the GRBs with redshift, concerning groups
determined by the closure relations. This allows us to check if the intrinsic
scatter \sigma_{int} of any of these groups is reduced compared to previous
literature. The most fulfilled environments for the electron spectral
distribution, p>2, are Wind Slow Cooling (SC) and ISM Slow Cooling for cases in
which the parameter q, which indicates the flatness of the plateau emission and
accounts for the energy injection, is =0 and =0.5, respectively, both in the

smallest \sigma_{int}=0.04 \pm 0.15 in terms of the fundamental plane relation

this paper, we establish an analogous stability result not involving a uniform
constant in accordance with a recent work on the $J$-equation by Song, which
makes further progress toward Collins-Jacob-Yau's original conjecture in the
supercritical phase case. In particular, we confirm this conjecture for

parallelization of applications as well as refactoring/design of applications
for efficient hardware usage remains restricted to experts who have advanced
technical knowledge and who can invest time tuning their software. In this
context, the compilation community has proposed different methods for automatic
parallelization, but their focus is traditionally on loops and nested loops
with the support of polyhedral techniques. In this study, we propose a new
approach to transform sequential C++ source code into a task-based parallel one
by inserting annotations. We explain the different mechanisms we used to create
tasks at each function/method call, and how we can limit the number of tasks.
Our method can be implemented on top of the OpenMP 4.0 standard. It is
compiler-independent and can rely on external well-optimized OpenMP libraries.
Finally, we provide preliminary performance results that illustrate the
potential of our method.

  Electronics for review",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Current-fed half bridge converter with bidirectional switches on ac side and
a full bridge converter on dc side of a high frequency transformer is an
optimal topology for single stage galvanically isolated ac-dc converter for
onboard vehicle charging application. AC side switches are actively commutated
to achieve zero current switching (ZCS) using single phase shift modulation
(SPSM) and discontinuous current phase shift modulation (DCPSM). Furthermore,
zero voltage turn-on (ZVS) is achieved for dc side switches. Compared to SPSM,
DCPSM maintains a constant peak current in the converter throughout the grid
cycle of ac mains voltage. However, constant peak current contributes to a high
circulating current near the zero crossings of ac mains voltage and also at
light load conditions. This paper proposes an improved discontinuous current
phase shift modulation (IDCPSM) to increase the efficiency of the converter
across different loading conditions. A dual control variable is adopted to
actively reduce the circulating current while maintaining soft switching of
both ac and dc side switches across the grid cycle of ac mains voltage. A 1.5
kW laboratory prototype has been developed to experimentally validate the
analysis, design and improvement in performance for different loading
conditions.

networks that can highly effect their performance. In this paper, an
optimisation problem is formulated to assign each user to an optimal access
point and a wavelength at a given time. This problem can be solved using mixed
integer linear programming (MILP). However, using MILP is not considered a
practical solution due to its complexity and memory requirements. In addition,
accurate information must be provided to perform the resource allocation.
Therefore, the optimisation problem is reformulated using reinforcement
learning (RL), which has recently received tremendous interest due to its
ability to interact with any environment without prior knowledge. In this
paper, we investigate solving the resource allocation optimisation problem in
VLC systems using the basic Q-learning algorithm. Two scenarios are simulated

demonstrate the ability of the Q-learning algorithm to provide optimal

different behaviour were promoted. Providing information about own performance
promoted self-monitoring. Slowing interactivity, play interdependency, and
joint object accessibility promoted collaboration. Offering delimited choices
promoted decision making. Problem solving and physical activity were promoted
by requiring children to engage in them to keep playing. Four principles
underpinned the ways in which physical digital play technologies afforded child
behaviour. These included social expectations framing play situations, the
directiveness of action regulations (inviting, guiding or forcing behaviours),
the technical features of play technologies (digital play mechanics and

the semi-deterministic wiretap channel. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work which demonstrates the secrecy performance of polar and
Reed-Muller codes in short blocklengths. The results show that under a total
variation secrecy metric, Reed Muller codes can achieve secrecy rates very
close to the second order approximation rate. On the other hand, we observe a
significant gap between the lower bound for the achievable rates of polar codes
and the the second order approximation rate for short blocklengths.

scattering medium. The goal is to estimate the support of the reflectivity
function of a remote scene from measurements of the backscattered wave field.
The proposed imaging methodology is based on the coherent interferometric
(CINT) approach that exploits the local empirical cross correlations of the
measurements of the wave field. The standard CINT images are known to be robust
(statistically stable) with respect to the random medium, but the stability
comes at the expense of a loss of resolution. This paper shows that a two-point
CINT function contains the information needed to obtain statistically stable
and high-resolution images. Different methods to build such images are
presented, theoretically analyzed and compared with the standard imaging
approaches using numerical simulations. The first method involves a
phase-retrieval step to extract the reflectivity function from the modulus of
its Fourier transform. The second method involves the evaluation of the leading
eigenvector of the two-point CINT imaging function seen as the kernel of a
linear operator. The third method uses an optimization step to extract the
reflectivity function from some cross products of its Fourier transform. The
presentation is for the synthetic aperture radar data acquisition setup, where
a moving sensor probes the scene with signals emitted periodically and records
the resulting backscattered wave. The generalization to other imaging setups,

outside of the light cone. Inside the light cone, we relate the leading-order
asymptotics to self-similar solutions that satisfy a system of ordinary
differential equations related to the Painlev\'e-III (PIII) equation. We
identify these solutions and show that they are related to a family of PIII
solutions recently discovered in connection with several limiting processes
involving the focusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. We fully explain a
resulting boundary layer phenomenon in which, even for smooth initial data (an
incident pulse), the solution makes a sudden transition over an infinitesimally
small propagation distance. At a formal level, this phenomenon has been
described by other authors in terms of the PIII self-similar solutions. We make
this observation precise and for the first time we relate the PIII self-similar
solutions to the Cauchy problem. Our analysis of the asymptotic behavior
satisfied by the optical field and medium density matrix reveals slow decay of
the optical field in one direction that is actually inconsistent with the
simplest version of scattering theory. Our results identify a precise generic
condition on an optical pulse incident on an initially-unstable medium
sufficient for the pulse to stimulate the decay of the medium to its stable

periodically sends assisted GPS data to the cloud. To determine which devices
are within the permissible limit of 5m, we perform clustering over assisted GPS
coordinates and track the clusters for about t mins to allow the measure of
spread. We assume that it takes around 3 or 5 mins to get the virus from an
infected object. For clustering, the proposed M way like tree data structure
stores the assisted GPS coordinates in degree, minute, and second format. Thus,
every user is mapped to a leaf node of the tree. We split the ""seconds"" part of
the assisted GPS location into m equal parts, which amount to d meter in
latitude(longitude). Hence, two users who are within d meter range will map to
the same leaf node. Thus, by mapping assisted GPS locations every t mins, we
can find out how many users came in contact with a particular user for at least
