in molecular clouds to the large, complex, polycyclic species long-suspected to
be carriers of the ubiquitous unidentified infrared emission bands remain
unclear. To investigate whether the formation of mono- and poly-cyclic
molecules observed in cold cores could form via the bottom-up reaction of
ubiquitous carbon-chain species with, e.g. atomic hydrogen, a search is made
for possible intermediates in data taken as part of the GOTHAM (GBT
Observations of TMC-1 Hunting for Aromatic Molecules) project. Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) Source Models were run to obtain column densities and
excitation temperatures. Astrochemical models were run to examine possible
formation routes, including a novel grain-surface pathway involving the
hydrogenation of C$_6$N and HC$_6$N, as well as purely gas-phase reactions
between C$_3$N and both propyne (CH$_3$CCH) and allene (CH$_2$CCH$_2$), as well
as via the reaction CN + H$_2$CCCHCCH. We report the first detection of
cyanoacetyleneallene (H$_2$CCCHC$_3$N) in space toward the TMC-1 cold cloud
using the Robert C. Byrd 100 m Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Cyanoacetyleneallene
may represent an intermediate between less-saturated carbon-chains, such as the
cyanopolyynes, that are characteristic of cold cores and the more
recently-discovered cyclic species like cyanocyclopentadiene. Results from our
models show that the gas-phase allene-based formation route in particular
produces abundances of H$_2$CCCHC$_3$N that match the column density of
$2\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ obtained from the MCMC Source Model, and that the
grain-surface route yields large abundances on ices that could potentially be
important as precursors for cyclic molecules.

optically thin radiation. Classifying the heating sources by spectral type,
O-type stars produce the greatest clump average temperature rises and largest

Present approaches to compute this scattering rely either on the Born

computation that requires large domain sizes to reduce the effects of boundary
conditions. The Born approximation and its extensions are limited in scope,
while the ab-initio approach suffers from its high numerical cost. In this
paper, I introduce a hybrid scheme in which an effective local electric
susceptibility tensor of a defect is estimated by solving an inverse problem
efficiently. The estimated tensor is embedded into an S-matrix formula based on
the reciprocity theorem. With this embedding, the computation of the S-matrix
of the defect requires field solutions only in the unit cell of the background.
In practice, this scheme reduces the computational cost by almost two orders of
magnitude, while sacrificing little in accuracy. The scheme demonstrates that
statistical estimation can capture sufficient information from cheap
calculations to compute quantities in the far field. I outline the fundamental
theory and algorithms to carry out the computations in high dielectric contrast
materials, including metals. I demonstrate the capabilities of this approach
with examples from optical inspection of nano-electronic circuitry where the
Born approximation fails and the existing methods for its extension are also

coupling in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Several secondary effects
such as gravitational lensing and CMB optical-depth anisotropies lead to mode
coupling in observed CMB anisotropies, i.e., non-zero off-diagonal elements in
the observed CMB covariance. To derive the mode coupling, however, we usually
assume no parity violation in the observed CMB anisotropies. We first derive a
new contribution to the CMB mode coupling arising from parity violation in
observed CMB. Since the isotropic polarization rotation leads to parity
violation in the observed CMB anisotropies, we then discuss the use of the new

advanced isolation policies while offering the potential for future
extensibility. At the core, we build upon an authenticated memory encryption
scheme that gives cryptographic isolation guarantees and, thus, streamlines the
security reasoning. We showcase the versatility of our approach by designing
and prototyping SERVAS -- an innovative enclave architecture for RISC-V. Unlike
current enclave systems, SERVAS facilitates efficient and secure enclave memory
sharing. While the memory encryption constitutes the main overhead, entering or
exiting a SERVAS enclave requires only 3.5x of a simple syscall, instead of 71x
for Intel SGX.

multi-view data, that is data collected from different sources on matched
samples. While existing methods for multi-view data decomposition explore
single matching of data by samples, we focus on double-matched multi-view data
(matched by both samples and source features). Our motivating example is the
miRNA data collected from both primary tumor and normal tissues of the same
subjects; the measurements from two tissues are thus matched both by subjects
and by miRNAs. Our proposed double-matched matrix decomposition allows to
simultaneously extract joint and individual signals across subjects, as well as
joint and individual signals across miRNAs. Our estimation approach takes
advantage of double-matching by formulating a new type of optimization problem
with explicit row space and column space constraints, for which we develop an
efficient iterative algorithm. Numerical studies indicate that taking advantage
of double-matching leads to superior signal estimation performance compared to
existing multi-view data decomposition based on single-matching. We apply our
method to miRNA data as well as data from the English Premier League soccer

complex biological phenomena. However, when accounting for stochasticity in the
internal dynamics of agents, these models frequently become computationally
expensive. Traditional techniques to reduce the computational intensity of such
models can lead to a reduction in the richness of the dynamics observed,
compared to the original system. Here we use large deviation theory to decrease
the computational cost of a spatially-extended multi-agent stochastic system
with a region of multi-stability by coarse-graining it to a continuous time
Markov chain on the state space of stable steady states of the original system.
Our technique preserves the original description of the stable steady states of
the system and accounts for noise-induced transitions between them. We apply
the method to a bistable system modelling phenotype specification of cells
driven by a lateral inhibition mechanism. For this system, we demonstrate how
the method may be used to explore different pattern configurations and unveil
robust patterns emerging on longer timescales. We then compare the full
stochastic, coarse-grained and mean-field descriptions via pattern
quantification metrics and in terms of the numerical cost of each method. Our
results show that the coarse-grained system exhibits the lowest computational
cost while preserving the rich dynamics of the stochastic system. The method
has the potential to reduce the computational complexity of hybrid multiscale

leptons, but in order to consistently assess the validity of this solution, a
global fit including the electroweak (EW) precision constraints and the low
energy tests of lepton flavour universality (LFU) is necessary. Performing such
a fit for gauge-invariant dimension-6 operators, we find that even when
assuming LFU, including the CKM elements $V_{us}$ and $V_{ud}$ into the
electroweak fit has a relevant impact, shifting the best fit point
significantly. Vector-like leptons (VLLs) are prime candidates for a
corresponding UV completion since they can affect the $W$ and $Z$ couplings to
leptons already at tree-level. Studying each pattern of new physics (NP) given
by the six possible representations of VLLs (under the SM gauge group) we find
that any single representation describes experimental data at most slighlty
better than the SM hypothesis. However, allowing for several representations of
VLLs at the same time, we find a simple scenario consisting of a singlet, $N$,
coupling to electrons and a triplet, $\Sigma_1$, coupling to muons which not

its best fit point is preferred by more than $4\,\sigma$ with respect to the

estimation of mutual information rate in calcium spike trains assumes primary
significance. However, such estimation is difficult with available methods

that in the cases where the density of extended mass is higher, the maximum

restructuring of the electricity markets and have been used to optimize the
decisions of market participants. They can potentially enhance system
reliability and manage price volatility by modifying the amount or time of
electricity consumption. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical model
accounting for the relationship between retailers (leaders) and consumers
(followers) in a dynamic price environment under uncertainty. The quality and
economic gains brought by the proposed procedure essentially stem from the
utilization of demand elasticity in a hierarchical decision process that
renders the options of different market configurations under different sources
of uncertainty. The model is solved under two frameworks: by considering the
retailer's market power and by accounting for an equilibrium setting based on a
perfect competitive game. These are formulated in terms of a mathematical
program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and with a mixed-integer linear
program (MILP), respectively. In particular, the retailers' market power model
is first formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, and the MPEC is
subsequently derived by replacing the consumers' problem (lower level) with its
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. In contrast, the equilibrium
model is solved as a MILP by concatenating the retailer's and consumers' KKT
optimality conditions. We illustrate the proposed procedure and numerically
assess the performance of the model using realistic data. Numerical results
show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model to explore the
interactions of market power and DR programs. The results confirm that
consumers are better off in an equilibrium framework while the retailer
increases its expected profit when exercising its market power.

labile structures (network, chains, etc...), hence the lifetime of such
structures is an important microscopic parameter, which can be calculated in
computer simulations. Since these cluster entities are mostly statistical in
nature, one would expect that, in the short time regime, their lifetime
distribution would be a broad Gaussian-like function of time, with a single
maximum representing their mean lifetime, and weakly dependent on criteria such
as the bonding distance and angle, much similarly to non-hydrogen bonding
simple liquids, while the long time part is known to have some power law
dependence. Unexpectedly, all the hydrogen bonding liquids studied herein,
namely water and alcohols, display highly hierarchic three types of specific
lifetimes, in the sub-picosecond range 0-0.5ps The dominant lifetime very
strongly depends on the bonding distance criterion and is related to hydrogen
bonded pairs. This mode is absent in non-H-bonding simple liquids. The
secondary and tertiary mean lifetimes are related to clusters, and are nearly
independent on the bonding criterion. Of these two lifetimes, only the first
one can be related to that of simple liquids, which poses the question of the
nature of the third life time. The study of acohols reveals that this 3rd
lifetime is related to the topology of H-bonded clusters, and that its
distribution may be also affected by the alkyl tail surrounding ""bath"". This
study reveals that hydrogen bonding liquids have a universal hierarchy of
hydrogen bonding lifetimes with a timescale regularity across very different
types, and which depend on the topology of the cluster structures

fluctuations to find the global minimum of a rugged energy landscape with many
local minima. Conceptually, QA is often framed in the context of the disordered
transverse field Ising model, in which a magnetic field applied perpendicular
to the Ising axis tunes the quantum fluctuations and enables the system to
tunnel through energy barriers, and hence reach the ground state more quickly.
A solid state material closely related to this model,
LiHo$_{0.45}$Y$_{0.55}$F$_4$, was shown to exhibit faster dynamics after a QA
protocol, compared to thermal annealing (TA), but little is known about the
actual process of optimization involved or the nature of the spin correlations
in the state that is reached. Here, we report on the microscopics of QA in this
material using diffuse magnetic neutron scattering. Comparing a QA to a TA
protocol that reach the same end-point, we find very similar final diffuse
scattering which consists of pinch-point scattering, largely consistent with
critical scattering near a phase boundary in the dipolar Ising ferromagnetic
model. However, comparing the time evolution at the end of the protocols, we
find that the spin correlations evolve more significantly after TA, suggesting
that QA produces a state closer to equilibrium. We also observe experimental
evidence that the transverse field produces random fields, which had been
previously predicted for this material and studied in other contexts. Thus,
while the material does exhibit a quantum speedup under quantum annealing
conditions, it is not a simple annealing problem; the energy landscape being
optimized is changing as the optimization proceeds.

grand unified theory (GUT). Due to its Goldstone nature, this pGDM evades the
direct DM detection experiments which, otherwise, severely constrain the
parameter space of DM models. In $SO(10)$, the pGDM is embedded as a linear
combination of the Standard Model (SM) singlet scalars in ${\bf 16_H}$ and
${\bf 126_H}$ representations. We consider two scenarios for the intermediate
route of $SO(10)$ symmetry breaking (SB) to the SM: $SU(5) \times U(1)_X$ and
Pati-Salam the $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ (4-2-2) gauge groups.
The vacuum expectation value of ${\bf 126_H}$, which triggers the breaking of
$U(1)_X$ and 4-2-2 symmetry in the two scenarios, respectively, determines the
pGDM lifetime whose astrophysical lower bound provides one of the most
stringent constraints. For the 4-2-2 route to $SO(10)$, the successful SM gauge
coupling unification requires the 4-2-2 breaking scale to be ${\cal O}
(10^{11})$ GeV, and most of the parameter space is excluded. For the $SU(5)
\times U(1)_X$ route, on the other hand, the $U(1)_X$ breaking scale can be
significantly higher, and a wide range of the parameter space is allowed.
Furthermore, the proton lifetime in the $SU(5)$ case is predicted to be $4.53
\times 10^{34}$ years, which lies well within the sensitivity reach of the
Hyper-Kamiokande experiment. We also examine the constraints on the model
parameter space from the Large Hadron Collider and the indirect DM search by
Fermi-LAT and MAGIC experiments.

interpreted as a consequence of the low inclination of the observer (around 17
deg for M87), which suppresses the Doppler beaming and boosting effects that
might otherwise be expected due to the nearly relativistic velocities of the
orbiting plasma. In this work, we use a large suite of general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations to reassess the validity of this argument. By
constructing explicit counter examples, we show that low-inclination is a
sufficient but not necessary condition for images to have low brightness
asymmetry. Accretion flow models with high accumulated magnetic flux close to
the black hole horizon (the so-called magnetically arrested disks) and low
black-hole spins have angular velocities that are substantially smaller than
the orbital velocities of test particles at the same location. As a result,
such models can produce images with low brightness asymmetry even when viewed

energy in string theory is assumed to take the form of a quintessence field in

triggering an apocalyptic phase transition in the low energy cosmological
dynamics after at most a few hundred Hubble times. As a result, dark energy
domination cannot continue indefinitely and there is at least a percentage
chance that we find ourselves in the first Hubble epoch. We use a toy model of
quintessence coupled to a tower of heavy states to explicitly demonstrate the
breakdown in the cosmological dynamics as the tower becomes light. This occurs
through a large number of corresponding particles being produced after a

understood well. In this study, we perform three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulations taking into account all the relevant cooling
processes and non-equilibrium chemical reactions up to the protostar density,
in order to study the collapse of magnetized primordial gas cores with
self-consistent thermal evolution. Our results show that the thermal evolution
of the central core is hardly affected by a magnetic field, because magnetic
forces do not prevent the contraction along the fields lines. We also find that
the magnetic braking extracts the angular momentum from the core and suppresses
fragmentation depending on the initial strength of the magnetic field. The
angular momentum transport by the magnetic outflows is less effective than that
by the magnetic braking because the outflows are launched only in a late phase
of the collapse. Our results indicate that the magnetic effects become
important for the field strength $B> 10^{-8}(n_{\rm H}/1\ \rm cm^{-3})^{2/3}\
\rm G$, where $n_{\rm H}$ is the number density, during the collapse phase.
Finally, we compare our results with simulations using a barotropic
approximation and confirm that this approximation is reasonable at least for
the collapse phase. Nevertheless, self-consistent treatment of the thermal and
chemical processes is essential for extending simulations to the accretion
phase, in which radiative feedback by protostars plays a crucial role.

mouths of a smoothed portal to induce self-annihilation, one naively might
think that a Euclidean topology is recovered, which would violate the classical

$\mu_{0,V}<26.5$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ within at least $\sim200$ projected kpc. We
separate the satellites into late- and early-type, finding the mass-size
relations are very similar between them, to within $\sim5\%$. This similarity
indicates that the quenching and transformation of a late-type dwarf into an
early-type involves only very mild size evolution. Considering the distribution
of apparent ellipticities, we infer the intrinsic shapes of the early- and
late-type samples. Combining with literature samples, we find that both types
of dwarfs get thicker at fainter luminosities but early-types are always
rounder at fixed luminosity. Finally, we compare the LV satellites with dwarf
samples from the cores of the Virgo and Fornax clusters. We find that the
cluster satellites show similar scaling relations to the LV early-type dwarfs

H II region to obtain a weighted average temperature within each ionization
zone. We re-derive the oxygen abundances of all CHAOS galaxies using this new
temperature prioritization method, and we find that the gradients are
consistent with the results of Berg et al. (2020). For NGC 2403, we measure a
direct oxygen abundance gradient of -0.09($\pm$0.03) dex/Re, with an intrinsic
dispersion of 0.037($\pm$0.017) dex, and an N/O abundance gradient of
-0.17($\pm$0.03) dex/Re with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.060($\pm$0.018) dex.
For direct comparison, we use the line intensities from the study of NGC 2403
by Berg et al. (2013), and find their recomputed values for the O/H and N/O
gradients are consistent with ours.

While most of the compact binary mergers detected by LIGO and Virgo are
expected to consist of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of
stars, others might instead be of second (or higher) generation, containing the
remnants of previous black-hole mergers. Such a subpopulation of hierarchically
assembled black holes presents distinctive gravitational-wave signatures,
namely higher masses, possibly within the pair-instability mass gap, and
dimensionless spins clustered at the characteristic value of $\sim$0.7. In
order to produce hierarchical mergers, astrophysical environments need to
overcome the relativistic recoils imparted to black-hole merger remnants, a
condition which prefers hosts with escape speeds $\gtrsim$ 100 km/s. Promising
locations for efficient production of hierarchical mergers include nuclear star
clusters and accretion disks surrounding active galactic nuclei, though
environments that are less efficient at retaining merger products such as
globular clusters may still contribute significantly to the detectable
population of repeated mergers. While GW190521 is the single most promising
hierarchical-merger candidate to date, constraints coming from large population
analyses are becoming increasingly more powerful.

the statistics for studying the star clusters of dwarfs in low-density

clusters. The LV dwarfs exhibit significantly lower nucleation fractions at
fixed galaxy mass than dwarfs in nearby clusters. The mass of NSCs of LV dwarfs
show a similar scaling of $M_{\star,\mathrm{NSC}}\propto
M_{\star,\mathrm{gal}}^{0.4}$ as that found in clusters but offset to lower NSC
masses. To deal with foreground/background contamination in the GC analysis, we
employ both a statistical subtraction and Bayesian approach to infer the
average GC system properties from all dwarfs simultaneously. We find that the
GC occupation fraction and average abundance are both increasing functions of
galaxy stellar mass, and the LV dwarfs show significantly lower average GC
abundance at fixed galaxy mass than a comparable sample of Virgo dwarfs
analyzed in the same way, demonstrating that GC prevalence also shows an
important secondary dependence on the dwarf's environment. This result
strengthens the connection between GCs and NSCs in low-mass galaxies. We
discuss these observations in the context of modern theories of GC and NSC

and chemical evolution of the Milky Way, and carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP)
stars are of special interest. However, little is known about CEMP stars in the
Galactic bulge. In this paper, we use the large spectroscopic sample of
metal-poor stars from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) to identify CEMP
stars ([C/Fe] > +0.7) in the bulge region and to derive a CEMP fraction. We
identify 96 new CEMP stars in the inner Galaxy, of which 62 are very metal-poor
([Fe/H] < -2.0); this is more than a ten-fold increase compared to the seven
previously known bulge CEMP stars. The cumulative fraction of CEMP stars in
PIGS is $42^{\,+14\,}_{\,-13} \%$ for stars with [Fe/H] < -3.0, and decreases
to $16^{\,+3\,}_{\,-3} \%$ for [Fe/H] < -2.5 and $5.7^{\,+0.6\,}_{\,-0.5} \%$
for [Fe/H] < -2.0. The PIGS inner Galaxy CEMP fraction for [Fe/H] < -3.0 is
consistent with the halo fraction found in the literature, but at higher
metallicities the PIGS fraction is substantially lower. While this can partly
be attributed to a photometric selection bias, such bias is unlikely to fully
explain the low CEMP fraction at higher metallicities. Considering the typical
carbon excesses and metallicity ranges for halo CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars, our
results point to a possible deficiency of both CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars
(especially the more metal-rich) in the inner Galaxy. The former is potentially
related to a difference in the binary fraction, whereas the latter may be the
result of a fast chemical enrichment in the early building blocks of the inner
Galaxy.

Kepler-129 is an hierarchical system consisting of two tightly-packed inner
planets and an external companion whose mass is close to the deuterium burning
limit. In such a system, two inner planets precess around the orbital normal of
the outer companion, causing their inclinations to oscillate with time. Based
on an asteroseismic analysis of Kepler data, we find tentative evidence that
Kepler-129 b and c are misaligned with stellar spin axis by $\gtrsim 38$ deg,
which could be torqued by Kepler-129 d if it is inclined by $\gtrsim 19$ deg
relative to inner planets. Using N-body simulations, we provide additional
constraints on the mutual inclination between Kepler-129 d and inner planets by
estimating the fraction of time during which two inner planets both transit.
The probability that two planets both transit decreases as their misalignment
with Kepler-129 d increases. We also find a more massive Kepler-129 c enables
the two inner planets to become strongly coupled and more resistant to
perturbations from Kepler-129 d. The unusually high mass of Kepler-129 c
provides a valuable benchmark for both planetary dynamics and interior
structure, since the best-fit mass is consistent with this $\rm{2.5\

excitation of other carriers. The radiative Auger process gives rise to weak
red-shifted satellite peaks in the optical emission spectrum. These satellite
peaks have been observed over a large spectral range: in the X-ray emission of
atoms; close to visible frequencies on donors in semiconductors and quantum
emitters; and at infrared frequencies as shake-up lines in two-dimensional
systems. So far, all the work on the radiative Auger process has focussed on
detecting the spontaneous emission. However, the fact that the radiative Auger
process leads to photon emission suggests that the transition can also be
optically excited. In such an inverted radiative Auger process, excitation
would correspond to simultaneous photon absorption and electronic
de-excitation. Here, we demonstrate optical driving of the radiative Auger
transition on a trion in a semiconductor quantum dot. The radiative Auger and
the fundamental transition together form a $\Lambda$-system. On driving both
transitions of this $\Lambda$-system simultaneously, we observe a reduction of
the fluorescence signal by up to $70\%$. Our results demonstrate a type of
optically addressable transition connecting few-body Coulomb interactions to
quantum optics. The results open up the possibility of carrying out THz
spectroscopy on single quantum emitters with all the benefits of optics:
coherent laser sources, efficient and fast single-photon detectors. In analogy
to optical control of an electron spin, the $\Lambda$-system between the
radiative Auger and the fundamental transitions allows optical control of the
emitters' orbital degree of freedom.

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of mass $\sim 10^9\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ were
already in place within the first $\sim$ Gyr after the Big Bang. Supermassive
stars (SMSs) with masses $10^{3-5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are potential seeds for
these observed SMBHs. A possible formation channel of these SMSs is the
interplay of gas accretion and runaway stellar collisions inside dense nuclear
star clusters (NSCs). However, mass loss due to stellar winds could be an
important limitation for the formation of the SMSs and affect the final mass.
In this paper, we study the effect of mass loss driven by stellar winds on the
formation and evolution of SMSs in dense NSCs using idealised N-body
simulations. Considering different accretion scenarios, we have studied the
effect of the mass loss rates over a wide range of metallicities
$Z_\ast=[.001-1]\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$ and Eddington factors $f_{\rm
Edd}=L_\ast/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}=0.5,0.7,\,\&\, 0.9$. For a high accretion rate of
$10^{-4}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$, SMSs with masses $\gtrsim 10^3\MSun$
could be formed even in a high metallicity environment. For a lower accretion
rate of $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$, SMSs of masses $\sim
10^{3-4}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed for all adopted values of $Z_\ast$
and $f_{\rm Edd}$, except for $Z_\ast=\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$ and $f_{\rm Edd}=0.7$
or 0.9. For Eddington accretion, SMSs of masses $\sim 10^3\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
can be formed in low metallicity environments with $Z_\ast\lesssim
0.01\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$. The most massive SMSs of masses $\sim
10^5\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed for Bondi-Hoyle accretion in

quasinormal mode (QNM) spectral instability under high wave-number
perturbations has been recently shown to be a common classical general
relativistic phenomenon [1]. This requires to assess its impact on the BH QNM
spectrum, in particular on BH QNM overtone frequencies. We conclude: i)
perturbed BH QNM overtones are indeed potentially observable in the GW
waveform, providing information on small-scale environment BH physics, and ii)
their detection poses a challenging data analysis problem of singular interest
for LISA astrophysics. We adopt a two-fold approach, combining theoretical
results from scattering theory with a fine-tuned data analysis on a
highly-accurate numerical GW ringdown signal. The former introduces a set of
effective parameters (partially lying on a BH Weyl law) to characterise QNM
instability physics. The latter provides a proof-of-principle demonstrating
that the QNM spectral instability is indeed accessible in the time-domain GW
waveform, though certainly requiring large signal-to-noise ratios. Particular
attention is devoted to discuss the patterns of isospectrality loss under QNM
instability, since the disentanglement between axial and polar GW parities may

causing gait disturbances. New advances in vision-based human pose-estimation
have opened possibilities for frequent and unobtrusive analysis of gait in

convolutional network (ST-GCN) architectures and training procedures to predict
clinical scores of parkinsonism in gait from video of individuals with

self-supervised pretraining stage that encourages the ST-GCN model to learn
about gait patterns before predicting clinical scores in the finetuning stage.
The proposed ST-GCN models are evaluated on joint trajectories extracted from
video and are compared against traditional (ordinal, linear, random forest)
regression models and temporal convolutional network baselines. Three 2D human
pose-estimation libraries (OpenPose, Detectron, AlphaPose) and the Microsoft

of Cosmic Microwave Background photons (IC/CMB) in the context of radio
galaxies. Owing to the steep increase of the CMB radiation energy density,
IC/CMB is supposed to become progressively more important with respect to radio
synchrotron cooling as the redshift increases. For typical energies at play,
this process will up-scatter the CMB photons into the X-ray band, and is thus
expected to yield a redshift-dependent, concurrent X-ray brightening and radio
dimming of the jet-powered structures. Here we show how a conclusive proof of
this effect hinges on high-resolution imaging data in which the extended lobes
can be distinguished from the compact hot spots where synchrotron-self-Compton
dominates the X-ray emission regardless of redshift. We analyze Chandra and
Very Large Array data of 11 radio galaxies between 1.3<z<4.3, and demonstrate
that the emission from their lobes is fully consistent with the expectations
from IC/CMB in equipartition. Once the dependence on size and radio luminosity
are properly accounted for, the measured lobe X-ray luminosities bear the
characteristic (1+z)**4 proportionality expected of a CMB seed radiation field.
Whereas this effect can effectively quench the (rest-frame) GHz radio emission
from z>3 radio galaxies below <1 mJy, IC/CMB alone can not be responsible for a
deficit in high-z, radio-loud AGN if--as we argue--such AGN typically have
bright, compact hot spots.

proven to be a successful method to improve pedestrian evacuations. In this
work, we will focus on the space limited by the exit and the obstacles (i.e.
the vestibule structure). We analyzed two different types of vestibules: the
two-entry vestibule (which consists of a single panel-like obstacle) and the
three-entry vestibule (which consists of two panel-like obstacles). In the
former, we studied the effects of varying the walls' friction coefficient
$\kappa_w$ and the distance from the obstacle to the exit door $d$. In the
latter, we varied the space between the two panels (gap). We found that the
three above mentioned parameters control the vestibule's density, which
subsequently affects the evacuation flow (fundamental diagram). We have also
found that reducing the distance $d$ or increasing the friction facilitates the
formation of blocking clusters at the vestibule entries, and hence, diminishes
the density. If the density is too large or too low, the evacuation flow is
suboptimal, whereas if the density is around $2 \pm 2$, the flow is maximized.
Our most important result is that the density (and therefore the evacuation
flow) can be precisely controlled by $\kappa_w$, $d$, and the gap. Moreover,
the three-entry vestibule produced the highest evacuation flow for specific
configurations of the gap and the distance from the panels to the door.

superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric $\mathrm{ThCoC_2}$ was proposed to be a
nodal $d$-wave and mediated by the spin fluctuations. Moreover, a non-BCS
behavior of the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat and the
magnetic upper critical field were reported. In this work, the electronic
structure, phonons and electron-phonon coupling are studied in
$\mathrm{ThCoC_2}$ on the basis of \textit{ab initio} computations. The effect
of the spin-orbit coupling on the electronic structure and electron-phonon
interaction is analyzed, and a large splitting of the electronic band structure
is found. The calculated electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda = 0.59$
remains in decent agreement with the experimental estimates, suggesting that
the electron-phonon interaction is strong enough to explain superconductivity
with $T_c \simeq 2.5$~K. Nevertheless, we show that the conventional isotropic
Eliashberg formalism is unable to describe the thermodynamic properties of the
superconducting state, as calculated temperature dependence of the electronic
specific heat and magnetic penetration depth deviate from experiments, which is
likely driven by the strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry
breaking. In addition, to shed more light on the pairing mechanism, we propose
to measure the carbon isotope effect, as our calculations based on the
electron-phonon coupling predict the observation of the isotope effect with an

properties of nanostructures than ones with isotropic and elliptical
dispersion, both metallic or dielectric. Here, we present a detailed
theoretical and numerical study of the unique optical properties of spherical
nanoantennas composed of such materials. Hyperbolic nanospheres exhibit a rich
modal structure that, depending on the polarization and direction of incident
light, can exhibit either a full plasmonic-like response with multiple electric
resonances, a single, dominant electric dipole or one with mixed magnetic and
electric modes with an atypical reversed modal order. We derive resonance
conditions for observing these resonances in the dipolar approximation and
offer insight into how the modal response evolves with the size, material
composition, and illumination. Specifically, the origin of the magnetic dipole
mode lies in the hyperbolic dispersion and its existence is determined by two
diagonal permittivity components of different sign. Our analysis shows that the
origin of this unusual behavior stems from complex coupling between electric
and magnetic multipoles, which leads to very strongly scattering or absorbing
modes. These observations assert that hyperbolic nanoantennas offer a promising
route towards novel light-matter interaction regimes.

matches PS1-14bj, a SLSN with an exceptionally long rise time consistent with a
PISN. Ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope data, spanning about 800
rest-frame days, reveal a significant light curve flattening, similar to that
seen in SN 2015bn, and much slower than the decline rate expected from
radioactive decay of $^{56}$Co. We therefore conclude that despite its slow

evolution matches the expected power-law spin-down of a magnetar central
engine, but with a shallower power law ($L\propto t^{-2.8}$) compared to that
in SN 2015bn, indicating a possible difference in the $\gamma$-ray opacity

of time-varying treatments, but they require an assumption of no unobserved
confounders between the treatment and outcome. With observational data, this
assumption may be difficult to maintain, and in studies with panel data, many
researchers use fixed effects models to purge the data of time-constant
unmeasured confounding. Unfortunately, traditional linear fixed effects models
are not suitable for estimating the effects of time-varying treatments, since
they can only estimate lagged effects under implausible assumptions. To resolve
this tension, we a propose a novel inverse probability of treatment weighting

unmeasured confounding in marginal structural models of fixed-length treatment

normal when the number of units and time periods grow at a similar rate. Unlike
traditional fixed effect models, this approach works even when the outcome is
only measured at a single point in time as is common in marginal structural
models. We apply these methods to estimating the effect of negative advertising

the boundary conditions are taken into account automatically by the semigroup

solely through penalty functions and thus changes the true solution, the
proposed method is able to address the boundary conditions without penalty
functions and it gives the correct true solution even when penalty functions
are added, thanks to the semigroup operator. For eigenvalue problems, a
primal-dual method is proposed, efficiently resolving the constraint with a
simple scalar dual variable and resulting in a faster algorithm compared with
the BSDE solver \cite{han2020solving} in certain problems such as the

our reweighted Jarzynski sampling recipe to four processes of varying scales

This proposed motion controller takes advantage of the CoP information by
incorporating it in the state input of the control policy network and adding it

perturbations including large human interaction forces during the training to
further improve control robustness. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
learning controller, we conduct numerical experiments with different settings
to demonstrate its remarkable ability on controlling the exoskeleton to
repetitively perform well balanced and robust squatting motions under strong

  clustered population",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Causal identification of treatment effects for infectious disease outcomes in
interconnected populations is challenging because infection outcomes may be
transmissible to others, and treatment given to one individual may affect
others' outcomes. Contagion, or transmissibility of outcomes, complicates
standard conceptions of treatment interference in which an intervention
delivered to one individual can affect outcomes of others. Several statistical
frameworks have been proposed to measure causal treatment effects in this
setting, including structural transmission models, mediation-based partnership
models, and randomized trial designs. However, existing estimands for
infectious disease intervention effects are of limited conceptual usefulness:
Some are parameters in a structural model whose causal interpretation is
unclear, others are causal effects defined only in a restricted two-person
setting, and still others are nonparametric estimands that arise naturally in
the context of a randomized trial but may not measure any biologically
meaningful effect. In this paper, we describe a unifying formalism for defining
nonparametric structural causal estimands and an identification strategy for
learning about infectious disease intervention effects in clusters of
interacting individuals when infection times are observed. The estimands
generalize existing quantities and provide a framework for causal
identification in randomized and observational studies, including situations
where only binary infection outcomes are observed. A semiparametric class of
pairwise Cox-type transmission hazard models is used to facilitate statistical
inference in finite samples. A comprehensive simulation study compares existing
and proposed estimands under a variety of randomized and observational vaccine
trial designs.

employ a Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) model for estimating
spatially-varying probability distributions of damage as a function of
hurricane wind field velocities. Specifically, we consider a physically-based,
quadratic NHPP model for failures of overhead assets in electricity
distribution systems. The wind field velocities are provided by Forecasts of
Hurricanes using Large-Ensemble Outputs (FHLO), a framework for generating
probabilistic hurricane forecasts. We use FHLO in conjunction with the NHPP
model, such that the hurricane forecast uncertainties represented by FHLO are
accounted for in estimating the probability distributions of damage.
Furthermore, we evaluate the spatial variability and extent of hurricane damage
under key wind field parameters (intensity, size, and asymmetries). By applying
our approach to prediction of power outages (loss-of-service) in northwestern
Florida due to Hurricane Michael (2018), we demonstrate a statistically
significant relationship between outage rate and failure rate. Finally, we
formulate parametric models that relate total damage and financial losses to
the hurricane parameters of intensity and size. Overall, this paper's findings
suggest that our approach is well-suited to jointly account for spatial
variability and forecast uncertainty in the damage estimates, and is readily
applicable to prediction of system loss-of-service due to the damage.

Exabytes on daily basis and then ultra-broadband Internet comes into play,
moving such data to the cloud. Internet traffic therefore has been experiencing
explosive growth and in this context, optical transport networks forming the
backbone of the Internet are pushed for transformation in system capacity.
While the intuitive solution of deploying multiple fibers can address the
pressing demand for increased capacity, doing so does not bring improvement in
economic of scales in terms of cost, power consumption and spectral efficiency.
This necessitates for a different approach so that the fiber capacity could be
utilized in a more efficient manner. In this paper, we focus on innovative
techniques, that is, photonic network coding and partial protection, to reduce
the effective traffic load in order to achieve greater capacity efficiency for
optical transport networks. Specifically, the application of network coding is
examined by upgrading the functionalities of intermediate nodes with
all-optical processing (i.e., encoding and decoding) capabilities. Besides,
partial protection relying on the premise of providing just enough bandwidth in

from its X-ray sources. We build on our previous Chandra analysis of Haro 11 by
analyzing three new observations. Our subpixel spatial analysis reveals that
the two previously known X-ray sources are each better modelled as ensembles of
at least 2 unresolved point sources. The spatial variability of these
components reveals X1 as a dynamical system where one luminous X-ray source
($L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) fades as a secondary source begins to
flare. These might be intermediate mass black holes or low luminosity active
galactic nuclei near the center of the galaxy in the process of merging.
Optical emission line diagnostics drawn from the literature suggest that while
the galaxy as a whole is consistent with starburst signatures of ionization,
the individual regions wherein the X-ray sources reside are more consistent
with AGN/composite classification. The sources in X2 exhibit some degree of
flux variability. X2a dominates the flux of this region during most
observations ($L_{\rm X} \sim 6\ \times\ 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and gives the

ability to support economic vitality and community livability it is essential
to consider the distribution of demand across diverse communities. In this
paper we expand the literature on ridehailing demand by exploring community
variation and spatial dependence in ridehailing use. Specifically, we
investigate the diffusion and role of solo requests versus ride-pooling to shed
light on how different mobility services, with different environmental and
accessibility implications, are used by diverse communities. This paper employs
a Social Disadvantage Index, Transit Access Analysis, and a Spatial Durbin
Model to investigate the influence of both local and spatial spillover effects
on the demand for shared and solo ridehailing. The analysis of 127 million
ridehailing rides, of which 15% are pooled, confirms the presence of spatial
effects. Results indicate that density and vibrancy variables have analogue
effects, both direct and indirect, on demand for solo vs pooled rides. Instead,
our analysis reveals significant contrasting effects for socio-economic
disadvantage, which is positively correlated with ride-pooling and negatively
with solo rides. Additionally, we find that higher rail transit access is
associated with higher demand for both solo and pooled ridehailing along with
substantial spatial spillovers. We discuss implications for policy, operations
and research related to the novel insight on how pooled ridesourcing relate to
geography, living conditions, and transit interactions.

Despite the potential
importance of crime rates in investments, there are no indices dedicated to
evaluating the financial impact of crime in the United States. As such, this
paper presents an index-based insurance portfolio for crime in the United

Investigation for property crimes and cybercrimes. Our research intends to help
investors envision risk exposure in our portfolio, gauge investment risk based
on their desired risk level, and hedge strategies for potential losses due to
economic crashes. Underlying the index, we hedge the investments by issuing
marketable European call and put options and providing risk budgets
(diversifying risk to each type of crime). We find that real estate,
ransomware, and government impersonation are the main risk contributors. We
then evaluate the performance of our index to determine its resilience to
economic crisis. The unemployment rate potentially demonstrates a high systemic
risk on the portfolio compared to the economic factors used in this study. In
conclusion, we provide a basis for the securitization of insurance risk from
certain crimes that could forewarn investors to transfer their risk to capital

quantum circuits. Because it is implemented as an embedded language in Haskell,
Quipper is a very practical functional language. However, for the same reason,
it lacks a formal semantics and it is limited by Haskell's type system. In
particular, because Haskell lacks linear types, it is easy to write Quipper
programs that violate the non-cloning property of quantum states. In order to
formalize relevant fragments of Quipper in a type-safe way, the Proto-Quipper
family of research languages has been introduced over the last years. In this
paper we first review Proto-Quipper-M, an instance of the Proto-Quipper family
based on a categorical model for quantum circuits, which features a linear type
system that guarantees that the non-cloning property holds at compile time. We
then derive a tentative small-step operational semantics from the big-step
semantics of Proto-Quipper-M and we prove that the two are equivalent. After
proving subject reduction and progress results for the tentative semantics, we
build upon it to obtain a truly small-step semantics in the style of an
abstract machine, which we eventually prove to be equivalent to the original

SimJEB's models are all designed for the same engineering function and thus
have consistent structural loads and support conditions. On the other hand,
SimJEB models are more complex, diverse, and realistic than the synthetically
generated datasets commonly used in parametric surrogate model evaluation. The
designs in SimJEB were derived from submissions to the GrabCAD Jet Engine
Bracket Challenge: an open engineering design competition with over 700
hand-designed CAD entries from 320 designers representing 56 countries. Each
model has been cleaned, categorized, meshed, and simulated with finite element

increase the performance of an intra-hour global solar irradiance forecasting
algorithm, it is important to detect multiple layers of clouds. The information
provided by a solar forecasting algorithm is necessary to optimize and schedule
the solar generation resources and storage devices in a smart grid. This
investigation studies the performance of unsupervised learning techniques when
detecting the number of cloud layers in infrared sky images. The images are
acquired using an innovative infrared sky imager mounted on a solar tracker.
Different mixture models are used to infer the distribution of the cloud
features. The optimal decision criterion to find the number of clusters in the
mixture models is analyzed and compared between different Bayesian metrics and
a sequential hidden Markov model. The motion vectors are computed using a
weighted implementation of the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. The correlations between
the cloud velocity vectors and temperatures are analyzed to find the method
that leads to the most accurate results. We have found that the sequential
hidden Markov model outperformed the detection accuracy of the Bayesian
metrics.

  The fundamental dynamics is based on an action whose potential energy is

Optimizing speech denoising systems towards a particular test-time speaker can
improve performance and reduce run-time complexity. However, test-time model
adaptation may be challenging if collecting data from the test-time speaker is
not possible. To this end, we propose using an ensemble model wherein each
specialist module denoises noisy utterances from a distinct partition of
training set speakers. The gating module inexpensively estimates test-time
speaker characteristics in the form of an embedding vector and selects the most
appropriate specialist module for denoising the test signal. Grouping the
training set speakers into non-overlapping semantically similar groups is
non-trivial and ill-defined. To do this, we first train a Siamese network using
noisy speech pairs to maximize or minimize the similarity of its output vectors
depending on whether the utterances derive from the same speaker or not. Next,
we perform k-means clustering on the latent space formed by the averaged
embedding vectors per training set speaker. In this way, we designate speaker
groups and train specialist modules optimized around partitions of the complete
training set. Our experiments show that ensemble models made up of low-capacity
specialists can outperform high-capacity generalist models with greater
efficiency and improved adaptation towards unseen test-time speakers.

studying the statistical properties of their light curves. Whereas others have
successfully inferred the properties of individual, highly variable KBOs, we
show that the fraction of KBOs with low amplitudes also provides fundamental
information about a population. Each light curve is primarily the result of two
factors: shape and orientation. We consider contact binaries and ellipsoidal
shapes, with and without flattening. After developing the mathematical
framework, we apply it to the existing body of KBO light curve data. Principal
conclusions are as follows. (1) When using absolute magnitude H as a proxy for
size, it is more accurate to use the maximum of the light curve rather than the
mean. (2) Previous investigators have noted that smaller KBOs have
higher-amplitude light curves, and have interpreted this as evidence that they
are systematically more irregular in shape than larger KBOs; we show that a
population of flattened bodies with uniform proportions could also explain this
result. (3) Our analysis indicates that prior assessments of the fraction of
contact binaries in the Kuiper Belt may be artificially low. (4) The pole
orientations of some KBOs can be inferred from observed changes in their light
curves; however, these KBOs constitute a biased sample, whose pole orientations
are not representative of the population overall. (5) Although surface
topography, albedo patterns, limb darkening, and other surface properties can
affect individual light curves, they do not have a strong influence on the
statistics overall. (6) Photometry from the OSSOS survey is incompatible with
previous results and its statistical properties defy easy interpretation. We
also discuss the promise of this approach for the analysis of future, much
larger data sets such as the one anticipated from the Rubin Observatory.

enhancement method to adapt a compact denoising model to the test-time
specificity. Our goal in this test-time adaptation is to utilize no clean
speech target of the test speaker, thus fulfilling the requirement for
zero-shot learning. To complement the lack of clean utterance, we employ the
knowledge distillation framework. Instead of the missing clean utterance
target, we distill the more advanced denoising results from an overly large
teacher model, and use it as the pseudo target to train the small student
model. This zero-shot learning procedure circumvents the process of collecting
users' clean speech, a process that users are reluctant to comply due to
privacy concerns and technical difficulty of recording clean voice. Experiments
on various test-time conditions show that the proposed personalization method
achieves significant performance gains compared to larger baseline networks
trained from a large speaker- and noise-agnostic datasets. In addition, since
the compact personalized models can outperform larger general-purpose models,
we claim that the proposed method performs model compression with no loss of
denoising performance.

coordination, and behavior of ant colonies. As a result, these algorithms are
designed to be naturally scalable to systems with numerous agents. While no
optimality is guaranteed, the method is intended to work well in practice and
scale better in efficacy with the number of agents present than others. The
approach combines single-agent RL and an ant-colony-inspired decentralized,
stigmergic algorithm for multi-agent path planning and environment
modification. Specifically, we apply this algorithm in a setting where agents
must navigate to a goal location, learning to push rectangular boxes into holes
to yield new traversable pathways. It is shown that while the approach yields
promising success in this particular environment, it may not be as easily
generalized to others. The algorithm designed is notably scalable to numerous

instructive to divide our contributions to two parts. In contrast to the

and past dependence, yielding essential utility to a wide range of
applications. A long-standing question of fundamental importance pertaining to
biology and ecology is: What are the minimal necessary and sufficient
conditions for long-term persistence and extinction (or for long-term
coexistence of interacting species) of a population? Regardless of the
particular applications encountered, persistence and extinction are properties
shared by Kolmogorov systems. While there are many excellent treaties of
stochastic-differential-equation-based Kolmogorov equations, the work on
stochastic Kolmogorov equations with past dependence is still scarce. Our aim
here is to answer the aforementioned basic question. This work, Part (I), is
devoted to characterization of persistence, whereas its companion, Part (II)
[45], is devoted to extinction. The main techniques used in this paper include
the newly developed functional It^o formula and asymptotic coupling and
Harris-like theory for infinite dimensional systems specialized to functional
equations. General theorems for stochastic functional Kolmogorov equations are
developed first. Then a number of applications are examined to obtain new
results substantially covering, improving, and extending the existing

catalogue, referred to as H/UC-HII catalogue, includes 89 cores that enshroud
hyper/ultra compact (H/UC) HII regions as characterized by associated compact
H40alpha emission. A second catalogue, referred to as pure s-cHMC, includes 32
candidate Hot Molecular Cores (HMCs) showing rich spectra (N>20lines) of
complex organic molecules (COMs) but not associated with H/UC-HII regions. The
third catalogue, referred to as pure w-cHMC, includes 58 candidate HMCs with
relatively low levels of COM richness and not associated with H/UC-HII regions.
These three catalogues of dense cores provide an important foundation for
future studies of the early stages of high-mass star formation across the Milky
Way. We also find that nearly half of H/UC-HII cores are candidate HMCs. From
the number counts of COM-containing and H/UC-HII cores, we suggest that the
duration of high-mass protostellar cores showing chemically rich features is at
least comparable to the lifetime of H/UC-HII regions. For cores in the H/UC-HII
catalogue, the width of the H40alpha line increases as the core size decreases,
suggesting that the non-thermal dynamical and/or pressure line-broadening
mechanisms dominate on the smaller scales of the H/UC-HII cores.

within course-grained dark matter haloes to study the effects of spurious
collisional heating on disk structure and kinematics. Collisional heating
artificially increases the vertical and radial velocity dispersions of disk
stars, as well as the thickness and size of disks; the effects are felt at all
galacto-centric radii. The integrated effects of collisional heating are
determined by the mass of dark matter halo particles (or equivalently, by the
number of particles at fixed halo mass), their local density and characteristic
velocity dispersion, but are largely insensitive to the stellar particle mass.
The effects can therefore be reduced by increasing the mass resolution of dark
matter in cosmological simulations, with limited benefits from increasing the
baryonic (or stellar) mass resolution. We provide a simple empirical model that
accurately captures the effects of spurious collisional heating on the
structure and kinematics of simulated disks, and use it to assess the
importance of disk heating for simulations of galaxy formation. We find that
the majority of state-of-the-art zoom simulations, and a few of the
highest-resolution, smallest-volume cosmological runs, are in principle able to
resolve thin stellar disks in Milky Way-mass haloes, but most large-volume
cosmological simulations cannot. For example, dark matter haloes resolved with
fewer than $\approx 10^6$ particles will collisionally heat stars near the
stellar half-mass radius such that their vertical velocity dispersion increases
by $\gtrsim 10$ per cent of the halo's virial velocity in approximately one

as residential and commercial districts, with different energy consumption
patterns, building structures, and car parks. The cost effectiveness and
decarbonization potentials of PV + EV and PV (+ battery) systems vary across
these different urban environments and change over time as cost structures
gradually shift. To evaluate these characteristics, we performed
techno-economic analyses of PV, battery, and EV technologies for a residential
area in Shinchi, Fukushima and the central commercial district of Kyoto, Japan

already cost competitive relative to existing energy systems (grid electricity
and gasoline car). In particular, the PV + EV system rapidly increases its
economic advantage over time, particularly in the residential district which
has larger PV capacity and EV battery storage relative to the size of energy
demand. Electricity exchanges between neighbors (e.g., peer-to-peer or
microgrid) further enhanced the economic value (net present value) and
decarbonization potential of PV + EV systems up to 23 percent and 7 percent in

track a dialogue state: predicting it from scratch and updating it from
previous state. The scratch-based strategy obtains each slot value by inquiring
all the dialogue history, and the previous-based strategy relies on the current
turn dialogue to update the previous dialogue state. However, it is hard for
the scratch-based strategy to correctly track short-dependency dialogue state
because of noise; meanwhile, the previous-based strategy is not very useful for
long-dependency dialogue state tracking. Obviously, it plays different roles
for the context information of different granularity to track different kinds
of dialogue states. Thus, in this paper, we will study and discuss how the
context information of different granularity affects dialogue state tracking.
First, we explore how greatly different granularities affect dialogue state

spin-charge conversion in the higher-order electric field terms has recently

paper proposes to predict the repeatability of an interest point as a function
of time, which can tell us the lifespan of the interest point considering daily

regressor trained on repeated interest points from multiple viewpoints over a
long period of time. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our

insightful analysis about this problem. For further comparison, we apply our RP
to the map summarization under visual localization framework, which builds a

Without considering the geometric relationships between local fields, they
typically require accurate normals to avoid the sign conflict problem in
overlapped regions of local fields, which severely limits their applicability
to raw scans where surface normals could be unavailable. Although SAL breaks
this limitation via sign-agnostic learning, further works still need to explore

to learn implicit surface reconstruction by sign-agnostic optimization of
convolutional occupancy networks, to simultaneously achieve advanced
scalability to large-scale scenes, generality to novel shapes, and
applicability to raw scans in a unified framework. Concretely, we achieve this
goal by a simple yet effective design, which further optimizes the pre-trained
occupancy prediction networks with an unsigned cross-entropy loss during
inference. The learning of occupancy fields is conditioned on convolutional
features from an hourglass network architecture. Extensive experimental

initiated by the activation of mechanosensitive (MS) proteins upon mechanically
induced deformations of the cell membrane. A current challenge to fully
understand this process is to predict how lipid bilayers deform upon
application of mechanical stress. In this context, it is now well established
that anionic lipids influence the function of many proteins. Here, we test the
hypothesize that anionic lipids could indirectly modulate MS proteins by
alteration of the lipid bilayer mechanical properties. Using all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations, we computed the bilayer bending rigidity (K_C), the area
compressibility (K_A), and the surface shear viscosity ({\eta}_m) of
phosphocholine (PC) lipid bilayers containing or not phosphatidylserine (PS) or
phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) at physiological concentrations in the
lower leaflet. Tensionless leaflets were first checked for each asymmetric
bilayer model, and a formula for embedding an asymmetric channel in an
asymmetric bilayer is proposed. Results from two different sized bilayers show
consistently that the addition of 20% surface charge in the lower leaflet of PC
bilayer by PIP2 has minimal impact on its mechanical properties, while PS
reduced the bilayer bending rigidity by 22%. As a comparison, supplementing the
PIP2-enriched PC membrane with 30% cholesterol, a known rigidifying steroid
lipid, produces a significant increase in all three mechanical constants.
Analysis of pairwise splay moduli suggests that the effect of anionic lipids on
bilayer bending rigidity largely depends on the number of anionic lipid pairs
formed during simulations. The potential implication of bilayer bending
rigidity is discussed in the framework of mechanosensitive Piezo channels.

we introduce a continuous-variable protocol which overcomes the repeaterless
bound and scales like the single-repeater bound using just one linear-optical
device called a ""quantum scissor"", combining the entanglement distillation and
entanglement swapping elements of previous repeater proposals into a single
step, thus, removing the need for quantum memories. Implementing a standard

predict key rates which surpass the repeaterless bound. Our protocol works well
for non-ideal single-photon sources and non-ideal single-photon detectors, and
can tolerate some level of excess noise, making our protocol implementable with
existing technology. We show that our scheme can be extended to longer repeater
chains using quantum memories, using less physical resources than previous
schemes. Furthermore, for applications beyond key distribution, our scheme
generalises to higher order and distils more entanglement at the cost of a

However, they are potentially vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where
sophisticated attackers can disrupt the learning procedure by injecting a
fraction of malicious samples into the training dataset. Existing defense
techniques against poisoning attacks are largely attack-specific: they are
designed for one specific type of attacks but do not work for other types,
mainly due to the distinct principles they follow. Yet few general defense
strategies have been developed. In this paper, we propose De-Pois, an
attack-agnostic defense against poisoning attacks. The key idea of De-Pois is
to train a mimic model the purpose of which is to imitate the behavior of the
target model trained by clean samples. We take advantage of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to facilitate informative training data
augmentation as well as the mimic model construction. By comparing the
prediction differences between the mimic model and the target model, De-Pois is
thus able to distinguish the poisoned samples from clean ones, without explicit
knowledge of any ML algorithms or types of poisoning attacks. We implement four
types of poisoning attacks and evaluate De-Pois with five typical defense

important yet challenging task. Static type inference techniques can precisely
infer variables with enough static constraints but are unable to handle
variables with dynamic features. Deep learning (DL) based approaches are
feature-agnostic, but they cannot guarantee the correctness of the predicted
types. Their performance significantly depends on the quality of the training
data (i.e., DL models perform poorly on some common types that rarely appear in
the training dataset). It is interesting to note that the static and DL-based
approaches offer complementary benefits. Unfortunately, to our knowledge,
precise type inference based on both static inference and neural predictions
has not been exploited and remains an open challenge. In particular, it is hard
to integrate DL models into the framework of rule-based static approaches. This
paper fills the gap and proposes a hybrid type inference approach named HiTyper
based on both static inference and deep learning. Specifically, our key insight
is to record type dependencies among variables in each function and encode the
dependency information in type dependency graphs (TDGs). Based on TDGs, we can
easily integrate type inference rules in the nodes to conduct static inference
and type rejection rules to inspect the correctness of neural predictions.
HiTyper iteratively conducts static inference and DL-based prediction until the
TDG is fully inferred. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that HiTyper
outperforms state-of-the-art DL models by exactly matching 10% more human
annotations. HiTyper also achieves an increase of more than 30% on inferring
rare types. Considering only the static part of HiTyper, it infers 2x ~ 3x more
types than existing static type inference tools.

execute computationally demanding DNNs across heterogeneous processing
elements. At runtime, the available hardware resources to DNNs can vary
considerably due to other concurrently running applications. The performance
requirements of the applications could also change under different scenarios.
To achieve the desired performance, dynamic DNNs have been proposed in which
the number of channels/layers can be scaled in real time to meet different
requirements under varying resource constraints. However, the training process
of such dynamic DNNs can be costly, since platform-aware models of different
deployment scenarios must be retrained to become dynamic. This paper proposes
Dynamic-OFA, a novel dynamic DNN approach for state-of-the-art platform-aware
NAS models (i.e. Once-for-all network (OFA)). Dynamic-OFA pre-samples a family
of sub-networks from a static OFA backbone model, and contains a runtime
manager to choose different sub-networks under different runtime environments.
As such, Dynamic-OFA does not need the traditional dynamic DNN training
pipeline. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our experimental results using
ImageNet on a Jetson Xavier NX show that the approach is up to 3.5x (CPU), 2.4x

memory overhead, limited runtime recoverable compression rate and narrow

using incremental training and group convolution pruning. The channels of the
DNN convolution layer are divided into groups, which are then trained
incrementally. At runtime, following groups can be pruned for inference
time/energy reduction or added back for accuracy recovery without model
retraining. In addition, we combine task mapping and Dynamic Voltage Frequency

of multiple wavelengths, including molecular emission lines, radio 1.4 GHz
continuum image, and Herschel 70 $\mu$m image, as well as ionized [Ne II] and
Paschen-alpha emissions. The results are compared with the observations of

at multiple wavelengths across the central molecular zone, including close-ups
of the Radio Arc and Sagittarius A West regions, on multi scales from $\sim$
0.1 pc to 10 pc. The magnetic fields towards the central molecular zone traced
by GT are globally compatible with the polarization measurements, accounting
for the contribution from the galactic foreground and background. This
correspondence suggests that the magnetic field and turbulence are dynamically
crucial in the galactic center. We find that the magnetic fields associated
with the Arched filaments and the thermal components of the Radio Arc are in
good agreement with the HAWC+ polarization. Our measurement towards the
non-thermal Radio Arc reveals the poloidal magnetic field components in the

classical results in single-channel source coding, such as that a multi-channel
Huffman code is an optimal tree-decodable code. We also show some evidences

phenomena across a plethora of fields. Its numerical implementation via Dynamic
Mode Decomposition (DMD) has been extensively deployed and improved upon over
the last decade. We address the problems of mean subtraction and DMD mode
selection in the context of finite dimensional Koopman invariant subspaces.
  Preprocessing of data by subtraction of the temporal mean of a time series
has been a point of contention in companion matrix-based DMD. This stems from
the potential of said preprocessing to render DMD equivalent to temporal DFT.
We prove that this equivalence is impossible in linearly consistent data, when
the order of the DMD-based representation of the dynamics exceeds the dimension
of the system. Therefore, this parity of DMD and DFT can be indicative of an
inadequacy of data, in the sense that the number of snapshots taken is not
enough to represent the true dynamics of the system.
  We then rigorously justify the practice of pruning DMD eigen-values based on
the norm of the respective modes. Once a minimum number of time delays has been
taken, DMD eigen-values corresponding to DMD modes with low norm are shown to
be spurious, and hence must be discarded. When dealing with mean-subtracted
data, the above criterion for detecting synthetic eigen-values can be applied
if DMD is preceded by time delay embedding.

in a unified framework, has attracted increasing attention due to its
simplicity of the two complimentary tasks. It remains an open problem
especially when processing arbitrarily-shaped text instances. Previous methods
can be roughly categorized into two groups: character-based and
segmentation-based, which often require character-level annotations and/or
complex post-processing due to the unstructured output. Here, we tackle
end-to-end text spotting by presenting Adaptive Bezier Curve Network v2 (ABCNet
v2). Our main contributions are four-fold: 1) For the first time, we adaptively
fit arbitrarily-shaped text by a parameterized Bezier curve, which, compared
with segmentation-based methods, can not only provide structured output but
also controllable representation. 2) We design a novel BezierAlign layer for
extracting accurate convolution features of a text instance of arbitrary
shapes, significantly improving the precision of recognition over previous
methods. 3) Different from previous methods, which often suffer from complex
post-processing and sensitive hyper-parameters, our ABCNet v2 maintains a
simple pipeline with the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS). 4)
As the performance of text recognition closely depends on feature alignment,
ABCNet v2 further adopts a simple yet effective coordinate convolution to
encode the position of the convolutional filters, which leads to a considerable
improvement with negligible computation overhead. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on various bilingual (English and Chinese) benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ABCNet v2 can achieve state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining very high efficiency.

and count polar subspaces of $W(2N-1,2)$ whose rank is $N-1$. $W(3,2)$ features
three negative lines of the same type and its $W(1,2)$'s are of five different
types. $W(5,2)$ is endowed with 90 negative lines of two types and its
$W(3,2)$'s split into 13 types. 279 out of 480 $W(3,2)$'s with three negative
lines are composite, i.\,e. they all originate from the two-qubit $W(3,2)$.
Given a three-qubit $W(3,2)$ and any of its geometric hyperplanes, there are
three other $W(3,2)$'s possessing the same hyperplane. The same holds if a
geometric hyperplane is replaced by a `planar' tricentric triad. A hyperbolic
quadric of $W(5,2)$ is found to host particular sets of seven $W(3,2)$'s, each
of them being uniquely tied to a Conwell heptad with respect to the quadric.
There is also a particular type of $W(3,2)$'s, a representative of which
features a point each line through which is negative. Finally, $W(7,2)$ is
found to possess 1908 negative lines of five types and its $W(5,2)$'s fall into
as many as 29 types. 1524 out of 1560 $W(5,2)$'s with 90 negative lines
originate from the three-qubit $W(5,2)$. Remarkably, the difference in the
number of negative lines for any two distinct types of four-qubit $W(5,2)$'s is
a multiple of four.

in order to enable the digital transformation of society. In this context,
aerial devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to address
this gap in hard-to-reach locations. However, limited battery-life is an
obstacle for the successful spread of such solutions. Reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising solution addressing this
challenge since on-board passive and lightweight controllable devices can
efficiently reflect the signal propagation from the ground BSs towards specific
target areas. In this paper, we focus on air-to-ground networks where UAVs
equipped with RIS can fly over selected areas to provide connectivity. In
particular, we study how to optimally compensate flight effects and propose
RiFe as well as its practical implementation Fair-RiFe that automatically
configure RIS parameters accounting for undesired UAV oscillations due to
adverse atmospheric conditions. Our results show that both algorithms provide

assess goodness-of-fit, which is necessary because in this model the zeta power
spectrum often cannot be modelled as a power-law over observable scales. For
the first time we are able to provide accurate forecasts for the amplitude of
three-point correlations. In a significant portion of its parameter space the
model follows Maldacena's single-field prediction fNL ~ -(5/12)(ns-1) if nt <<
1. Therefore |fNL| is usually small when the power spectrum satisfies
observational constraints. In a small number of cases the bispectrum is instead
dominated by effects from rapid switching between angular minima. The resulting
amplitudes are larger, but mostly with unacceptable spectral behaviour. In the
most extreme case we obtain |fNLeq| ~ 75 at kt/3 = 0.002/Mpc. It has been
suggested that the quasi-single field inflation (""QSFI"") mechanism could
produce significant 3-point correlations in this model. We do observe rare
shifts in amplitude between equilateral and squeezed configurations that could
possibly be associated with QSFI effects, but more investigation is needed to
establish the full bispectrum shape. There is evidence of ""shape"" running
between equilateral and squeezed configurations that may be inherited from the
scale dependence of the spectrum. We explore the dependence of observables on
discrete choices such as the truncation point of the potential. Our analysis
illustrates the advantages of a standard format for information exchange within

this paper, we consider the synchronous \emph{neighborhood rendezvous problem},

probabilistic, asymmetric, and can use whiteboards placed at vertices. Our main
contribution is to clarify the situation (with respect to computational models

precisely, we present two algorithms achieving fast rendezvous additionally
assuming bounded minimum degree, unique vertex identifier, accessibility to

correspondence of various known chromospheric structures visible in the H-alpha

region were analyzed using single-dish ALMA observations (1.21 mm, 248 GHz) and
in an active region using interferometric ALMA measurements (3 mm, 100 GHz).
With the single-dish observations, a full-disk solar image is produced, while
interferometric measurements enable the high-resolution reconstruction of part
of the solar disk, including the active region. The selected quiet Sun and
active regions are compared with the H-alpha (core and wing sum), EUV, and soft
X-ray images and with the magnetograms. Results. In the quiet Sun region,
enhanced emission seen in the ALMA is almost always associated with a strong
line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field. Four coronal bright points were identified,
while other small-scale ALMA bright features are most likely associated with
magnetic network elements and plages. In the active region, in 14 small-scale
ALMA bright features randomly selected and compared with other images, we found
five good candidates for coronal bright points, two for plages, and five for
fibrils. Two unclear cases remain: a fibril or a jet, and a coronal bright
point or a plage. A comparison of the H-alpha core image and the 3 mm ALMA
image of the analyzed active region showed that the sunspot appears dark in
both images (with a local ALMA radiation enhancement in sunspot umbra), the
four plage areas are bright in both images and dark small H-alpha filaments are
clearly recognized as dark structures of the same shape also in ALMA.

foundation for content-based RS image retrieval (CBIR). Recently, deep metric
learning approaches that map the semantic similarity of images into an
embedding (metric) space have been found very popular in RS. A common approach
for learning the metric space relies on the selection of triplets of similar
(positive) and dissimilar (negative) images to a reference image called as an
anchor. Choosing triplets is a difficult task particularly for multi-label RS
CBIR, where each training image is annotated by multiple class labels. To
address this problem, in this paper we propose a novel triplet sampling method
in the framework of deep neural networks (DNNs) defined for multi-label RS CBIR
problems. The proposed method selects a small set of the most representative
and informative triplets based on two main steps. In the first step, a set of
anchors that are diverse to each other in the embedding space is selected from
the current mini-batch using an iterative algorithm. In the second step,
different sets of positive and negative images are chosen for each anchor by
evaluating the relevancy, hardness and diversity of the images among each other
based on a novel strategy. Experimental results obtained on two multi-label
benchmark archives show that the selection of the most informative and
representative triplets in the context of DNNs results in: i) reducing the
computational complexity of the training phase of the DNNs without any
significant loss on the performance; and ii) an increase in learning speed
since informative triplets allow fast convergence. The code of the proposed
method is publicly available at

rays passing in their vicinity will acquire random phases. In the ""two-slit""
model of an interferometer this can, for a high density of \bhsn, lead to a
diffusion in the phase difference between the two arms of the interferometer
and thus to a loss of coherence or ``visibility''in interferometric
observations. Hence the existence of ""fringe constrast"" or ""visibility"" in
interferometric observations can be used to put a limit on the possible
presence of \bhs along the flight path.
  We give a formula for this effect and consider its application, particularly
for observations in cosmology. Under the assumption that the dark matter
consists of black holes, we consider sources at high z, up to the CMB. While
the strongest results are for the CMB as the most remote source, more nearby
sources at high z lead to similar effects.
  The effect increases with the baseline, and in the limiting case of the CMB
we find that with earth-size baselines a non-zero ""visibility"" would limit the
mass of possible primordial black holes, to approximately $M/M_\odot \leq
10^{-1}$. Although such limits would not appear to be as strong as those
obtained, say from microlensing, they involve a much different methodology and
are dominated by very early times (see Table 1).
  Longer baselines lead to more stringent limits and in principle with extreme
lengths, the method could possibly find positive evidence for primordial black
holes. In this case, however, all other kinds of phase averaging would have to
be constrained or eliminated.

  Astronomy",,"10.1007/s10569-021-10027-7",,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We study orbital evolution of multi-planet systems that form a resonant
chain, with nearest neighbours close to first order commensurabilities,
incorporating orbital circularisation produced by tidal interaction with the
central star. We develop a semi-analytic model applicable when the relative
proximities to commensurability, though small, are large compared to
epsilon^(2/3) , with epsilon being a measure of the characteristic planet to
central star mass ratio. This enables determination of forced eccentricities as
well as which resonant angles enter libration. When there are no active linked
three body Laplace resonances, the rate of evolution of the semi-major axes may
also be determined. We perform numerical simulations of the HD 158259 and EPIC
245950175 systems finding that the semi-analytic approach works well in the
former case but not so well in the latter case on account of the effects of
three active three body Laplace resonances which persist during the evolution.
For both systems we estimate that if the tidal parameter, Q', significantly
exceeds 1000, tidal effects are unlikely to have influenced period ratios
significantly since formation. On the other hand if Q' < ~ 100 tidal effects
may have produced significant changes including the formation of three body
Laplace resonances in the case of the EPIC 245950175 system.

our everyday interaction with deformable objects by improving our efficiency

tackled cloth manipulation using exclusively single-arm quasi-static actions,
which requires a large number of interactions for challenging initial cloth
configurations and strictly limits the maximum cloth size by the robot's reach
range. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic flinging
actions for cloth unfolding with our proposed self-supervised learning
framework, FlingBot. Our approach learns how to unfold a piece of fabric from
arbitrary initial configurations using a pick, stretch, and fling primitive for
a dual-arm setup from visual observations. The final system achieves over 80%
coverage within 3 actions on novel cloths, can unfold cloths larger than the
system's reach range, and generalizes to T-shirts despite being trained on only
rectangular cloths. We also finetuned FlingBot on a real-world dual-arm robot
platform, where it increased the cloth coverage over 4 times more than the
quasi-static baseline did. The simplicity of FlingBot combined with its
superior performance over quasi-static baselines demonstrates the effectiveness
of dynamic actions for deformable object manipulation.

five-dimensional gauge-Higgs unification (5D GHU) model at a scale above TeV.
We note that the vanishing of the Higgs quartic coupling and the proximity of
the top quark Yukawa coupling and weak gauge coupling at high scales, inferred
from the experimental data, are in harmony with 5D GHU, because in 5D GHU
models the Higgs quartic coupling is forbidden by the 5D gauge symmetry and the
Yukawa couplings and the weak gauge coupling originate from a common 5D gauge
coupling. Based on the above insight, we propose a 5D GHU model where the
Standard Model fermions are embedded in 5D fermions in a way to tightly relate
the top Yukawa coupling with the weak gauge coupling. Also, the model predicts
the presence of vector-like fermions (other than the Kaluza-Klein modes), which
can affect the RG evolutions of the 4D theory and reconcile the scale of
vanishing Higgs quartic coupling and that of equality of the top Yukawa and
weak gauge couplings, thereby achieving a successful matching of the 4D theory
with 5D GHU. We predict the vector-like fermion mass and the compactification
scale of 5D GHU from the conditions for the successful matching.

interpolation capabilities of two models. Smoothness and plausibility of linear
interpolations in latent space are associated with the quality of the
underlying generative model. In this paper, we show that not all such
interpolations are comparable as they can deviate arbitrarily from the shortest
interpolation curve given by the geodesic. This deviation is revealed by
computing curve lengths with the pull-back metric of the generative model,
finding shorter curves than the straight line between endpoints, and measuring
a non-zero relative length improvement on this straight line. This leads to a
strategy to compare linear interpolations across two generative models. We also
show the effect and importance of choosing an appropriate output space for
computing shorter curves. For this computation we derive an extension of the

issues of RFID is that tags cannot use energy-hungry cryptography. For this
reason, radio fingerprinting (RFP) is a compelling approach that leverages the
unique imperfections in the tag's wireless circuitry to achieve large-scale
RFID clone detection. Recent work, however, has unveiled that time-varying
channel conditions can significantly decrease the accuracy of the RFP process.
We propose the first large-scale investigation into RFP of RFID tags with
dynamic channel conditions. Specifically, we perform a massive data collection
campaign on a testbed composed by 200 off-the-shelf identical RFID tags and a
software-defined radio (SDR) tag reader. We collect data with different
tag-reader distances in an over-the-air configuration. To emulate implanted
RFID tags, we also collect data with two different kinds of porcine meat
inserted between the tag and the reader. We use this rich dataset to train and
test several convolutional neural network (CNN)--based classifiers in a variety
of channel conditions. Our investigation reveals that training and testing on
different channel conditions drastically degrades the classifier's accuracy.
For this reason, we propose a novel training framework based on federated
machine learning (FML) and data augmentation (DAG) to boost the accuracy.
Extensive experimental results indicate that (i) our FML approach improves
accuracy by up to 48%; (ii) our DA approach improves the FML performance by up

demonstrating the efficacy of FML and DA on a large device population. We are

using different fusion techniques. A novel fusion approach is developed which
extends existing speed reconstruction methods to integrate low-resolution
travel time data. Several state-of-the-art methods and the novel approach are
evaluated on their performance in reconstructing traffic speeds and travel
times using various combinations of sensor data. Algorithms and sensor setups
are evaluated with real loop detector, floating car and Bluetooth data
collected during severe congestion on German freeway A9. Two main aspects are
examined: (i) which algorithm provides the most accurate result depending on
the used data and (ii) which type of sensor and which combination of sensors
yields higher estimation accuracies. Results show that, overall, the novel
approach applied to a combination of floating-car data and loop data provides
the best speed and travel time accuracy. Furthermore, a fusion of sources
improves the reconstruction quality in many, but not all cases. In particular,
Bluetooth data only provide a benefit for reconstruction purposes if integrated
distinctively.

Nonetheless, when applied to multimodal datasets (i.e., datasets acquired by

presence of nonlinearity and disorder. It is known that any localized initial
excitation in a large enough linear disordered system spreads for a finite
amount of time and then halts forever. This phenomenon is called Anderson
localization (AL). What happens to AL when nonlinearity is introduced is an
interesting question which has been considered in several studies over the past
decades. However, the characteristics and the asymptotic fate of such
evolutions still remain an issue of intense debate due to their computational
difficulty, especially in systems of more than one spatial dimension. As the
spreading of initially localized wave packets is a non-equilibrium
thermalization process related to the ergodic and chaotic properties of the
system, in our work we investigate the properties of chaos studying the
behavior of observables related to the system's tangent dynamics. In
particular, we consider the disordered discrete nonlinear Schr\""odinger (DDNLS)
equation of one (1D) and two (2D) spatial dimensions. We present detailed
computations of the time evolution of the system's maximum Lyapunov exponent
(MLE--$\Lambda$), and the related deviation vector distribution (DVD). We find
that although the systems' MLE decreases in time following a power law
$t^{\alpha_\Lambda}$ with $\alpha_\Lambda <0$ for both the weak and strong
chaos regimes, no crossover to the behavior $\Lambda \propto t^{-1}$ (which is
indicative of regular motion) is observed. In addition, the analysis of the
DVDs reveals the existence of random fluctuations of chaotic hotspots with
increasing amplitudes inside the excited part of the wave packet, which assist
in homogenizing chaos and contribute to the thermalization of more lattice
sites.

graph degeneracy. In particular, we prove that the maximum discrepancy over all
subgraphs $H$ of a graph $G$ of the neighborhood set system of $H$ is
sandwiched between $\Omega(\log\mathrm{deg}(G))$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{deg}(G))$, where $\mathrm{deg}(G)$ denotes the degeneracy
of $G$. We extend this result to inequalities relating weak coloring numbers
and discrepancy of graph powers and deduce a new characterization of bounded
expansion classes.
  Then, we switch to a model theoretical point of view, introduce pointer
structures, and study their relations to graph classes with bounded expansion.
We deduce that a monotone class of graphs has bounded expansion if and only if
all the set systems definable in this class have bounded hereditary
discrepancy.
  Using known bounds on the VC-density of set systems definable in nowhere
dense classes we also give a characterization of nowhere dense classes in terms
of discrepancy. As consequences of our results, we obtain a corollary on the
discrepancy of neighborhood set systems of edge colored graphs, a
polynomial-time algorithm to compute $\varepsilon$-approximations of size
$\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ for set systems definable in bounded expansion

  We investigate the complexity landscape of this model, showing that QMAPs can

stars with similar parallaxes and proper motions are finally selected as
members. The spatial distribution of the members shows that this star-forming
region is highly substructured. The young open cluster NGC 2244 in the center
of the nebula has a pattern of radial expansion and rotation. We discuss its
implication on the cluster formation, e.g., monolithic cold collapse or
hierarchical assembly. On the other hand, we also investigate three groups
located around the border of the H II bubble. The western group seems to be
spatially correlated with the adjacent gas structure, but their kinematics is
not associated with that of the gas. The southern group does not show any
systematic motion relative to NGC 2244. These two groups might be spontaneously
formed in filaments of a turbulent cloud. The eastern group is spatially and
kinematically associated with the gas pillar receding away from NGC 2244. This
group might be formed by feedback from massive stars in NGC 2244. Our results
suggest that the stellar population in the Rosette Nebula may form through
three different processes: the expansion of stellar clusters, hierarchical star
formation in turbulent clouds, and feedback-driven star formation.

  Planted Partitions","Accepted at NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral clustering is popular among practitioners and theoreticians alike.
While performance guarantees for spectral clustering are well understood,
recent studies have focused on enforcing ``fairness'' in clusters, requiring
them to be ``balanced'' with respect to a categorical sensitive node attribute
(e.g. the race distribution in clusters must match the race distribution in the
population). In this paper, we consider a setting where sensitive attributes
indirectly manifest in an auxiliary \textit{representation graph} rather than
being directly observed. This graph specifies node pairs that can represent
each other with respect to sensitive attributes and is observed in addition to
the usual \textit{similarity graph}. Our goal is to find clusters in the
similarity graph while respecting a new individual-level fairness constraint
encoded by the representation graph. We develop variants of unnormalized and
normalized spectral clustering for this task and analyze their performance
under a \emph{fair} planted partition model induced by the representation
graph. This model uses both the cluster membership of the nodes and the
structure of the representation graph to generate random similarity graphs. To
the best of our knowledge, these are the first consistency results for
constrained spectral clustering under an individual-level fairness constraint.
Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings.

With the rapid expansion of practical dialogue systems and virtual assistants,

discrete, number of seen intents. Recent years have seen some work done on
unseen intent detection in the context of zero-shot learning. This paper
continues the prior work by proposing a novel model where intents are
continuous points placed in a specialist Intent Space that yields several
advantages. First, the continuous representation enables to investigate
relationships between the seen intents. Second, it allows any unseen intent to
be reliably represented given limited quantities of data. Finally, this paper
will show how the proposed model can be augmented with unseen intents without
retraining any of the seen ones. Experiments show that the model can reliably
add unseen intents with a high accuracy while retaining a high performance on

However, direct light-matter coupling between microwave photons and skyrmion

a function of temperature within the expected skyrmion phase. We attribute the
maximum in effective coupling strength to the presence of a large number of
skyrmions, and correspondingly to a completely stable skyrmion lattice. Our
experimental findings indicate that the coupling between photons and resonant

in which a team of vehicles needs to plan coordinated routes to patrol an area
over iterations while minimizing temporally and spatially dependent costs. In
particular, at a specific location (e.g., a vertex on a graph), we assume the
cost grows linearly in expectation with an unknown rate, and the cost is reset
to zero whenever any vehicle visits the vertex (representing the robot
servicing the vertex). We formulate this problem in graph terminology and call
it Team Orienteering Coverage Planning with Uncertain Reward (TOCPUR). We
propose to solve TOCPUR by simultaneously estimating the accumulated cost at
every vertex on the graph and solving a novel variant of the Team Orienteering

(TOCP). We provide the first mixed integer programming formulation for the

and high angles of incidence but low amplitudes of oscillation, shock induced
flow separation or shock-stall is observed accompanied by shock reversal. Even
though the power input to the airfoil by the viscous forces is three orders of
magnitude lower than that due to the pressure forces on the airfoil, the
boundary layer manipulates the shock location and shock motion and
redistributes the power input to the airfoil by the pressure forces. The shock
motion is reversed relative to that in an inviscid flow as the boundary layer
cannot sustain an adverse pressure gradient posed by the shock, causing the
shock to move upstream leading to an early separation. The shock motion shows a
phase difference with reference to the airfoil motion and is a function of the
frequency of the oscillation. At low angles of incidence, and low amplitudes of
oscillation, the boundary layer changes the profile presented to the external
flow, leads to a slower expansion of the flow resulting in an early shock, and
a diffused shock-foot caused by the boundary layer.

(IoT). One typical application of DL in IoT is device identification from
wireless signals, namely Non-cryptographic Device Identification (NDI).
However, learning components in NDI systems have to evolve to adapt to
operational variations, such a paradigm is termed as Incremental Learning (IL).
Various IL algorithms have been proposed and many of them require dedicated
space to store the increasing amount of historical data, and therefore, they
are not suitable for IoT or mobile applications. However, conventional IL
schemes can not provide satisfying performance when historical data are not
available. In this paper, we address the IL problem in NDI from a new
perspective, firstly, we provide a new metric to measure the degree of
topological maturity of DNN models from the degree of conflict of
class-specific fingerprints. We discover that an important cause for
performance degradation in IL enabled NDI is owing to the conflict of devices'
fingerprints. Second, we also show that the conventional IL schemes can lead to
low topological maturity of DNN models in NDI systems. Thirdly, we propose a
new Channel Separation Enabled Incremental Learning (CSIL) scheme without using
historical data, in which our strategy can automatically separate devices'
fingerprints in different learning stages and avoid potential conflict.
Finally, We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real
data from ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), an application of
IoT in aviation. The proposed framework has the potential to be applied to
accurate identification of IoT devices in a variety of IoT applications and
services. Data and code available at IEEE Dataport (DOI: 10.21227/1bxc-ke87)

manifold, pseudo generalized quasi-Einstein manifold and many more and name it
comprehensive quasi Einstein manifold C(QE)$_{n}$. We investigate some
geometric and physical properties of the comprehensive quasi Einstein manifolds
C(QE)$_{n}$ under certain conditions. We study the conformal and conharmonic
mappings between C(QE)$_{n}$ manifolds. Then we examine the C(QE)$_{n}$ with
harmonic Weyl tensor. We investigate geometric and physical properties of the
comprehensive quasi Einstein manifolds C(QE)$_{n}$ under certain conditions. We
define the manifold of comprehensive quasi-constant curvature and proved that
conformally flat C(QE)$_{n}$ is manifold of comprehensive quasi-constant
curvature and vice versa. We study the general two viscous fluid spacetime
C(QE)$_{4}$ and find out some important consequences about C(QE)$_{4}$. We
study C(QE)$_{n}$ with vanishing space matter tensor. Finally, we prove the
existence of such manifolds by constructing non-trivial example.

phase-transition problems, with focus on solidification and melting. We solve
for the temperature and flow fields over time. The position of the phase-change
interface is tracked with a level-set method, which requires knowledge of the
heat-flux discontinuity at the interface. In order to compute the heat-flux
jump, we build upon the ghost-cell approach and extend it to the space-time
finite element method. This technique does not require a local enrichment of
the basis functions, such as methods like extended finite elements, and it can
be easily implemented in already existing finite element codes. Verification
cases for the 1D Stefan problem and the lid-driven cavity melting problem are
provided. Furthermore, we show a more elaborate 2D case in view of complex
applications.

anti-SARS activity and a reinforcement learning algorithm that generates highly
novel molecules. During generation, we explore optimization toward several
design targets to balance druglikeness, synthetic accessability, and anti-SARS
activity based on \icfifty. This generative
framework\footnote{https://github.com/exalearn/covid-drug-design} will
accelerate drug discovery in future pandemics through the high-throughput
generation of targeted therapeutic candidates.

pouring. Many factors have an effect on target accuracy, including pouring
velocity, rotation angle, geometric of the source, and the receiving
containers. This paper presents an approach to increase the repeatability and
accuracy of the robotic manipulator by estimating the change in the amount of
water of the pouring cup to a sequence of pouring actions using multiple layers
of the deep recurrent neural network, especially gated recurrent units (GRU).
The proposed GRU model achieved a validation mean squared error as low as 1e-4
(lbf) for the predicted value of weight f(t). This paper contains a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of numerous experiments with various
designs of recurrent neural networks and hyperparameters fine-tuning.

Two types of similar models based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism are used as
the basic elements of the networks. The first type model demonstrates bursting
oscillations. The second model demonstrates bistability between bursting
attractor and stable steady state. Basin of attraction of the stable
equilibrium in the model is very small. Bistabilty is a result taking into
account an additional ion channel, which has a non-monotonic characteristic and
can be interpreted as a channel with a communication defect. Suggested
multiplex networks assumed more active communication between models with a
defect as a result in such networks it is enough to have one element with a
communication defect in the subnetworks in order to stabilize the state of
equilibrium in the entire network.

the framework of thermodynamics. Kardashev's proposal to evaluate the
development of celestial civilizations by the amount of energy they are able to
use was adopted to translate the concept of human activity into the language of
physics. The discussion is limited to considering the last 500 years of history
from the beginning of the scientific and technological revolutions to our
immediate future. The application of classical and nonequilibrium
thermodynamics is discussed. In the framework of classical thermodynamics, two
systems are compared: a) the first is a hypothetical quasi-equilibrium system,
Earth without a population. Since biological evolution becomes almost
imperceptible for a short period of time, such a system remains in the same
pristine state for the entire period; (b) the second is our habitable planet,
which is not in equilibrium due to rapid anthropogenic evolution and can be
considered as a combination of the first system with human civilization. It is
shown that in response to the development of civilization (a) the equilibrium
of the hypothetical system is disturbed and processes are initiated aimed at
reducing the amount of energy produced, and (b) there is a maximum on the path
of civilization development over time. The resistance of nature will continue
until a new balance is established, corresponding to a lower level of energy
production. The central problem is whether humanity is ready and able to agree
on a new balance, otherwise the degradation of our planet can lead to the
collapse of civilization.
