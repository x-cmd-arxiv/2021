ice dynamics that explicitly model floes and discontinuities in the ice, which
can be challenging to represent accurately with current models. However,
floe-scale stresses that inform lead formation in sea ice are difficult to
calculate in current DEM implementations. In this paper, we use the ParticLS
software library to develop a DEM that models the sea ice as a collection of
discrete rigid particles that are initially bonded together using a cohesive
beam model that approximates the response of an Euler-Bernoulli beam located
between particle centroids. Ice fracture and lead formation are determined
based on the value of a non-local Cauchy stress state around each particle and
a Mohr-Coulomb fracture model. Therefore, large ice floes are modeled as
continuous objects made up of many bonded particles that can interact with each
other, deform, and fracture. We generate particle configurations by
discretizing the ice in MODIS satellite imagery into polygonal floes that fill
the observed ice shape and extent. The model is tested on ice advecting through
an idealized channel and through Nares Strait. The results indicate that the
bonded DEM model is capable of qualitatively capturing the dynamic sea ice
patterns through constrictions such as ice bridges, arch kinematic features,
and lead formation. In addition, we apply spatial and temporal scaling analyses
to illustrate the model's ability to capture heterogeneity and intermittency in
the simulated ice deformation.

of a combinatorial explosion in the complex size. For $n$ points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, we present a scheme to construct a $2$-approximation of the
filtration of the Rips complex in the $L_\infty$-norm, which extends to a
$2d^{0.25}$-approximation in the Euclidean case. The $k$-skeleton of the
resulting approximation has a total size of $n2^{O(d\log k +d)}$. The scheme is
based on the integer lattice and simplicial complexes based on the barycentric
subdivision of the $d$-cube.
  We extend our result to use cubical complexes in place of simplicial
complexes by introducing cubical maps between complexes. We get the same
approximation guarantee as the simplicial case, while reducing the total size
of the approximation to only $n2^{O(d)}$ (cubical) cells.
  There are two novel techniques that we use in this paper. The first is the
use of acyclic carriers for proving our approximation result. In our
application, these are maps which relate the Rips complex and the approximation
in a relatively simple manner and greatly reduce the complexity of showing the
approximation guarantee. The second technique is what we refer to as scale

number of blockable destinations for a device being 11. We further analyze the
destination of network traffic and find that all third parties observed in our

information can be gained by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES),
which measures the electronic structure with momentum resolution. Here we
report on the use of extremely low energy ARPES (photon energy $\sim$ 7 eV) to
increase its depth sensitivity and access buried QW states, located at 3 nm and
6 nm below the surface of cubic-GaN/AlN and GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures,
respectively. We find that the QW states in cubic-GaN/AlN can indeed be
observed, but not their energy dispersion because of the high surface
roughness. The GaAs/AlGaAs QW states, on the other hand, are buried too deep to
be detected by extremely low energy ARPES. Since the sample surface is much
flatter, the ARPES spectra of the GaAs/AlGaAs show distinct features in
momentum space, which can be reconducted to the band structure of the topmost
surface layer of the QW structure. Our results provide important information
about the samples' properties required to perform extremely low energy ARPES
experiments on electronic states buried in semiconductor heterostructures.

such an event, air leaks into the liquid-helium-cooled accelerator beamline
tube and condenses on its inner surface, causing rapid boiling of the helium
and dangerous pressure build-up. Understanding the coupled heat and mass
transfer processes is important for the design of beamline cryogenic systems.
Our past experimental study on nitrogen gas propagating in a copper tube cooled
by normal liquid helium (He I) has revealed a nearly exponential slowing down
of the gas front. A theoretical model that accounts for the interplay of the
gas dynamics and the condensation was developed, which successfully reproduced
various key observations. However, since many accelerator beamlines are
actually cooled by the superfluid phase of helium (He II) in which the heat
transfer is via a non-classical thermal-counterflow mode, we need to extend our
work to the He II cooled tube. This paper reports our systematic measurements
using He II and the numerical simulations based on a modified model that
accounts for the He II heat-transfer characteristics. By tuning the He II peak
heat-flux parameter in our model, we have reproduced the observed gas dynamics
in all experimental runs. The fine-tuned model is then utilized to reliably
evaluate the heat deposition in He II. This work not only advances our
understanding of condensing gas dynamics but also has practical implications to
the design codes for beamline safety.

synchronized. The asynchrony error can degrade the monitoring accuracy in
distribution networks. To address this challenge, we propose a principal
component pursuit (PCP)-based data recovery strategy. Since asynchrony results
in a loss of temporal correlation among SMs, the key idea in our solution is to
leverage a PCP-based low rank matrix recovery technique to maximize the
temporal correlation between multiple data streams obtained from SMs. Further,
our approach has a novel multi-objective structure, which allows utilities to
precisely refine and recover all SM-measured variables, including voltage and
power measurements, while incorporating their inherent dependencies through
power flow equations. We have performed numerical experiments using real SM

combined with a powerful denoiser to obtain state-of-the-art image
reconstructions. This is typically done by taking a proximal algorithm such as
FISTA or ADMM, and formally replacing the proximal map associated with a
regularizer by nonlocal means, BM3D or a CNN denoiser. Each iterate of the
resulting PnP algorithm involves some kind of inversion of the forward model
followed by denoiser-induced regularization. A natural question in this regard
is that of optimality, namely, do the PnP iterations minimize some f+g, where f
is a loss function associated with the forward model and g is a regularizer?
This has a straightforward solution if the denoiser can be expressed as a
proximal map, as was shown to be the case for a class of linear symmetric
denoisers. However, this result excludes kernel denoisers such as nonlocal
means that are inherently non-symmetric. In this paper, we prove that a broader
class of linear denoisers (including symmetric denoisers and kernel denoisers)
can be expressed as a proximal map of some convex regularizer g. An algorithmic
implication of this result for non-symmetric denoisers is that it necessitates
appropriate modifications in the PnP updates to ensure convergence to a minimum
of f+g. Apart from the convergence guarantee, the modified PnP algorithms are
shown to produce good restorations.

the objects in the DSS as tracers of the peculiar-velocity field, we compare
against the corresponding reconstruction from the 2M++ galaxy redshift survey.
Our analysis -- which takes special care to properly weight each DSS
subcatalogue and cross-calibrate the relative distance scales between them --
results in a measurement of the cosmological parameter combination $f\sigma_8 =
0.390_{-0.022}^{+0.022}$ as well as an external bulk flow velocity of
$195_{-23}^{+22}$ km s$^{-1}$ in the direction $(\ell, b) = (292_{-7}^{+7},
-6_{-4}^{+5})$ deg, which originates from beyond the 2M++ reconstruction.
Similarly, we find a bulk flow of $245_{-31}^{+32}$ km s$^{-1}$ toward $(\ell,
b) = (294_{-7}^{+7}, 3_{-5}^{+6})$ deg on a scale of $\sim 30 h^{-1}$ Mpc if we
ignore the reconstructed peculiar-velocity field altogether. Our constraint on
$f\sigma_8$ -- the tightest derived from SNe to date (considering only
statistical error bars), and the only one to utilise SNe II -- is broadly
consistent with other results from the literature. We intend for our data
accumulation and treatment techniques to become the prototype for future

images of the H$_2$O-PN IRAS 18061--2505. It appears a pinched-waist bipolar PN
consisting of knotty lobes with some point-symmetric regions, a bow-shock near
the tip of each lobe, and a very compact inner nebula where five components are
identified in the spectra by their kinematic and emission properties. The water
masers most probably reside in an oxygen-rich ring tracing the equatorial
region of the bipolar lobes. These two structures probably result from common
envelope evolution plus several bipolar and non-bipolar collimated outflows
that have distorted the lobes. The bow-shocks could be related to a previous
phase to that of common envelope. The inner nebula may be attributed to a late
or very late thermal pulse that occurred before 1951.6 when it was not
detectable in the POSSI-Blue image. Chemical abundances and other properties
favour a 3--4 M$_{\odot}$ progenitor, although if the common envelope phase
accelerated the evolution of the central star, masses <1.5 M$_{\odot}$ cannot
be discarded. The age of the bipolar lobes is incompatible with the existence
of water masers in IRAS 18061--2505, which may have been lately reactivated
through shocks in the oxygen-rich ring, that are generated by the thermal
pulse, implying that this PN is not extremely young. We discuss H$_2$O-PNe and
possibly related objects in the light of our results for IRAS 18061--2505.

interaction (B$-\rm{\overline{B}}$) at low-energy and its strength and range
are crucial in the assessment of possible baryonic bound states. Experimental
data on annihilation cross sections are available for the p$-\rm{\overline{p}}$
system but not in the low relative momentum region. Data regarding the
B$-\rm{\overline{B}}$ interaction with strange degrees of freedom are extremely
scarce, hence the modeling of the annihilation contributions is mainly based on
nucleon$-$antinucleon (N$-\rm{\overline{N}}$) results, when available. In this
letter we present a measurement of the p$-\rm{\overline{p}}$,
p$-\overline{\Lambda}\oplus\rm{\overline{p}}-\Lambda$ and
$\Lambda-\overline{\Lambda}$ interaction using correlation functions in the
relative momentum space in high-multiplicity triggered pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV recorded by ALICE at the LHC. In the p$-\rm{\overline{p}}$
system the couplings to the mesonic channels in different partial waves are
extracted by adopting a coupled-channel approach with recent $\chi\rm{EFT}$
potentials. The inclusion of these inelastic channels provides good agreement
with the data, showing a significant presence of the annihilation term down to
zero momentum. Predictions obtained using the Lednick\'y$-$Lyuboshits formula
and scattering parameters obtained from heavy-ion collisions, hence mainly
sensitive to elastic processes, are compared with the experimental
p$-\overline{\Lambda}\oplus\rm{\overline{p}}-\Lambda$ and
$\Lambda-\overline{\Lambda}$ correlations. The model describes the
$\Lambda-\overline{\Lambda}$ data and underestimates the
p$-\overline{\Lambda}\oplus\rm{\overline{p}}-\Lambda$ data in the region of
momenta below 200 MeV/$c$. The observed deviation indicates a different
contribution of annihilation channels to the two systems containing strange
hadrons.

nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) approach treats specified nuclei, typically
protons, quantum mechanically on the same level as the electrons, thereby
including the associated nuclear quantum effects and non-Born-Oppenheimer
behavior into quantum chemistry calculations. The multicomponent density
functional theory (NEO-DFT) and time-dependent DFT (NEO-TDDFT) methods allow
efficient calculations of ground and excited states, respectively. Herein, the
analytical gradients are derived and implemented for the NEO-TDDFT method and
the associated Tamm-Dancoff approximation (NEO-TDA). The programmable equations
for these analytical gradients, as well as the NEO-DFT analytical Hessian, are
provided. The NEO approach includes the anharmonic zero-point energy and
density delocalization associated with the quantum protons, as well as vibronic
mixing, in geometry optimizations and energy calculations of ground and excited
states. The harmonic zero-point energy associated with the other nuclei can be
computed via the NEO Hessian. This approach is used to compute the 0-0
adiabatic excitation energies for a set of nine small molecules with all
protons quantized, exhibiting slight improvement over the conventional
electronic approach. Geometry optimizations of two excited state intramolecular
proton transfer systems are performed with one and two quantized protons,
respectively. The NEO calculations for these systems produce electronically
excited state geometries with stronger intramolecular hydrogen bonds and
similar relative stabilities compared to conventional electronic methods. This
work provides the foundation for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of
fundamental processes such as photoinduced proton transfer and proton-coupled
electron transfer.

to the presence of disorder, both internal and external (i.e. related to the
interactions with the dielectric layer), especially for n-type materials.
Internal dynamic disorder stems from large thermal fluctuations both in
intermolecular transfer integrals and (molecular) site energies in weakly
interacting van der Waals solids and sources transient localization of the
charge carriers. The molecular vibrations that drive transient localization
typically operate at low-frequency (< a-few-hundred cm-1), which renders it
difficult to assess them experimentally. Hitherto, this has prevented the
identification of clear molecular design rules to control and reduce dynamic
disorder. In addition, the disorder can also be external, being controlled by
the gate insulator dielectric properties. Here we report on a comprehensive
study of charge transport in two closely related n-type molecular organic
semiconductors using a combination of temperature-dependent inelastic neutron
scattering and photoelectron spectroscopy corroborated by electrical
measurements, theory and simulations. We provide unambiguous evidence that ad
hoc molecular design enables to free the electron charge carriers from both
internal and external disorder to ultimately reach band-like electron
transport.

permitting such evaluation is a needed area within respiratory medicine; their
adoption remains slow, with poor workflow accuracy. Diseased lung regions often
produce high-density zones on CT images, limiting an algorithm's execution to
specify damaged lobes due to oblique or lacking fissures. This impact motivated
developing an improved machine learning method to segment lung lobes that
utilises tracheobronchial tree information to enhance segmentation accuracy
through the algorithm's spatial familiarity to define lobar extent more
accurately. The method undertakes parallel segmentation of lobes and auxiliary
tissues simultaneously by employing multi-task learning (MTL) in conjunction
with V-Net-attention, a popular convolutional neural network in the imaging
realm. In keeping with the model's adeptness for better generalisation, high
performance was retained in an external dataset of patients with four distinct
diseases: severe lung cancer, COVID-19 pneumonitis, collapsed lungs and Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), even though the training data included
none of these cases. The benefit of our external validation test is
specifically relevant since our choice includes those patients who have
diagnosed lung disease with associated radiological abnormalities. To ensure
equal rank is given to all segmentations in the main task we report the
following performance (Dice score) on a per-segment basis: normal lungs 0.97,
COPD 0.94, lung cancer 0.94, COVID-19 pneumonitis 0.94 and collapsed lung 0.92,
all at p<0.05. Even segmenting lobes with large deformations on CT images, the
model maintained high accuracy. The approach can be readily adopted in the

exploration for stable perovskite-related structures with respect to its

identify hexagonal perovskite-related polytypic transformation as a function of
composition in the Ba1-xSrxMnO3 oxides after annealing at different

in a narrow composition-temperature range of the BaCexMn1-xO3 oxides. In

of compositions and annealing temperatures in the Sr1-xCexMnO3 oxides. This
structure stability is further enhanced along the BaCexMn1-xO3 - Sr1-xCexMnO3

learning model of Seq2Seq was employed to decode molecular structures from the
solutions. To test feasibility of the algorithm, we challenged RDD to generate
novel drugs that can activate {\mu} opioid receptor (MOR) and penetrate blood
brain barrier (BBB). Starting from vectors of random numbers, RDD generated
180,000 chemical structures, of which 78% were chemically valid. About 42,000
(31%) of the valid structures fell into the property space defined by MOR
activity and BBB permeability. Out of the 42,000 structures, only 267 chemicals
were commercially available, indicating a high extent of novelty of the
AI-generated compounds. We purchased and assayed 96 compounds, and 25 of which

hard of hearing individuals. Since signed languages exhibit all the fundamental
linguistic properties of natural language, we believe that tools and theories
of Natural Language Processing (NLP) are crucial towards its modeling. However,
existing research in Sign Language Processing (SLP) seldom attempt to explore
and leverage the linguistic organization of signed languages. This position
paper calls on the NLP community to include signed languages as a research area
with high social and scientific impact. We first discuss the linguistic
properties of signed languages to consider during their modeling. Then, we
review the limitations of current SLP models and identify the open challenges
to extend NLP to signed languages. Finally, we urge (1) the adoption of an
efficient tokenization method; (2) the development of linguistically-informed
models; (3) the collection of real-world signed language data; (4) the
inclusion of local signed language communities as an active and leading voice
in the direction of research.

the width tends to infinity, the learning dynamics tends to a nonlinear and
nontrivial dynamical limit, known as the mean field limit. This lends a way to
study large-width neural networks via analyzing the mean field limit. Recent
works have successfully applied such analysis to two-layer networks and
provided global convergence guarantees. The extension to multilayer ones
however has been a highly challenging puzzle, and little is known about the
optimization efficiency in the mean field regime when there are more than two
layers.
  In this work, we prove a global convergence result for unregularized
feedforward three-layer networks in the mean field regime. We first develop a
rigorous framework to establish the mean field limit of three-layer networks
under stochastic gradient descent training. To that end, we propose the idea of
a \textit{neuronal embedding}, which comprises of a fixed probability space
that encapsulates neural networks of arbitrary sizes. The identified mean field
limit is then used to prove a global convergence guarantee under suitable
regularity and convergence mode assumptions, which -- unlike previous works on
two-layer networks -- does not rely critically on convexity. Underlying the
result is a universal approximation property, natural of neural networks, which
importantly is shown to hold at \textit{any} finite training time (not
necessarily at convergence) via an algebraic topology argument.

block of many-body quantal systems comprised of fermions. It also induces a
""Pauli repulsion"" in the interaction between di-nuclear systems. It has been
shown in [Phys. Rev. C 95, 031601 (2017)] that the Pauli repulsion widens the
nucleus-nucleus potential barrier, thus hindering sub-barrier fusion. Purpose:
To investigate the proton and neutron contributions to the Pauli repulsion,
both in the bare potential neglecting shape polarization and transfer between
the reactants, as well as in the dynamical potential obtained by accounting for
such dynamical rearrangements. Methods: As the basis of our study we utilize
the Pauli kinetic energy (PKE) obtained by studying the nuclear localization
function (NLF). Recently this approach has been generalized to incorporate all
of the dynamical and time-odd terms present in the nuclear energy density
functional. This approach is employed in the DCFHF and DC-TDHF methods.
Results: The PKE spatial distribution shows that a repulsion occurs in the neck
between the nuclei when they first touch. Inside the barrier, neutrons can
contribute significantly more to the Pauli repulsion in neutron-rich systems.
Dynamical effects tend to lower the Pauli repulsion near the barrier. Proton
and neutron dynamical contributions to the PKE significantly differ inside the
barrier for asymmetric collisions, which is interpreted as an effect of
multinucleon transfer. Conclusions: The PKE is shown to make a significant
contribution to nuclear interaction potentials. Protons and neutrons can play
very different roles in both the bare potential and in the dynamical
rearrangement. Further microscopic studies are required to better understand
the role of transfer and to investigate the effect of pairing and deformation.

widely used measure of forecast accuracy in businesses and organizations. It is

systematically selects those whose predictions are too low. This is not widely
discussed and so is not generally known among practitioners. We explain why
this happens. We investigate an alternative relative accuracy measure which
avoids this bias: the log of the accuracy ratio: log (prediction / actual).
Relative accuracy is particularly relevant if the scatter in the data grows as
the value of the variable grows (heteroscedasticity). We demonstrate using
simulations that for heteroscedastic data (modelled by a multiplicative error
factor) the proposed metric is far superior to MAPE for model selection.
Another use for accuracy measures is in fitting parameters to prediction
models. Minimum MAPE models do not predict a simple statistic and so
theoretical analysis is limited. We prove that when the proposed metric is used
instead, the resulting least squares regression model predicts the geometric
mean. This important property allows its theoretical properties to be
understood.

the Sonora-Bobcat assumptions of cloudless and chemical-equilibrium atmospheres

evolution), a hierarchical triple stellar system can be well approximated, from
the standpoint of orbital parameter estimation, as two binary star systems
combined. Even under this simplifying approximation, the inference of orbital
elements is a challenging technical problem because of the high dimensionality
of the parameter space, and the complex relationships between those parameters
and the observations (astrometry and radial velocity). In this work we propose
a new methodology for the study of triple hierarchical systems using a Bayesian
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo-based framework. In particular, graphical models are
introduced to describe the probabilistic relationship between parameters and
observations in a dynamically self-consistent way. As information sources we
consider the cases of isolated astrometry, isolated radial velocity, as well as
the joint case with both types of measurements. Graphical models provide a
novel way of performing a factorization of the joint distribution (of parameter
and observations) in terms of conditional independent components (factors), so
that the estimation can be performed in a two-stage process that combines
different observations sequentially. Our framework is tested against three
well-studied benchmark cases of triple systems, where we determine the inner
and outer orbital elements, coupled with the mutual inclination of the orbits,
and the individual stellar masses, along with posterior probability (density)
distributions for all these parameters. Our results are found to be consistent
with previous studies. We also provide a mathematical formalism to reduce the
dimensionality in the parameter space for triple hierarchical stellar systems

(corresponding to $\approx 7$ virial radii). At $\lesssim
30~\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ from the galaxies the median HI and CIV optical
depths are enhanced by an order of magnitude. The absorption is significantly
stronger around the $\approx 1/3$ of our LAEs that are part of `groups', which
we attribute to the large-scale structures in which they are embedded. We do
not detect any strong dependence of either the HI or CIV absorption on
transverse distance (over the range $\approx 50-250$ pkpc), redshift, or the
properties of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line (luminosity, full width at half

distinct Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transitions, one in the
charge sector and the other in the spin sector. However, it has been recognized
that there are actually three possible BKT transitions, involving the
deconfinement of, respectively, the conventional vortices, the merons and the
half-quantum vortices with vorticity in both the charge and the spin current.
We show how all the transitions can be characterized by the relation between
the voltage drop and the spin-polarized current bias. This study reveals that,
due to the hitherto unexamined transport of half-quantum vortices, there is an
upper bound on the spin supercurrent in a quasi-long range ordered spin-triplet
superconductor, which provides a means for half-quantum vortex detection via
transport measurements and deeper understanding of fluctuation effects in
superconductor-based spintronic devices.

by magnetic fluctuations. In Mbarek & Caprioli (2019), we traced test-particle
CRs in high-resolution magnetohyrodynamic (MHD) jet simulations and found that
the associated spectral slope, chemical composition, and anisotropy are
consistent with UHECR phenomenology. In this work, we extend such an analysis
by including sub-grid pitch-angle scattering to model small-scale magnetic
turbulence that cannot be resolved by MHD simulations. We find that a large
scattering rate unlocks stochastic acceleration and fosters the energization of
lower-energy CRs, which eventually leads to harder UHECR spectra. Yet, the

invariably produced by espresso acceleration and their spectrum is independent

classical time crystals do not need to resonate in a subharmonic fashion but
instead can also exhibit a continuously tunable anharmonic response to driving,

branches of the dispersion relation in a parametrically driven medium. This
response, characterized by a typically incommensurate ratio between the
resonant frequencies and the driving frequency, is demonstrated by introducing
a time crystal model consisting of an array of coupled pendula with alternating

involving a fixed point and an invariant torus, with no intermediate limit
cycles. This bifurcation thus gives rise to a many-body symmetry-breaking
phenomenon directly connecting the symmetry-unbroken phase with a previously
uncharacterized phase of matter, which we call an anharmonic time crystal

massive objects ($\gtrsim 1 \% M_{\rm sol}$), while executing a random walk,
remain largely confined to the soliton due to dynamical friction. We also
present an effective treatment of the diffusion, based on kinetic theory, that

hadron-quark stars. The equilibrium stable hybrid hadron-quark star branch is
separated by the stable neutron star branch with a branch of unstable hybrid
hadron-quark stars. The end-state of these unstable configurations has not been
studied, yet, and it could have implications for the formation and existence of
twin stars -- hybrid stars with the same mass as neutron stars but different
radii. We modify existing hybrid hadron-quark equations of state with a
first-order phase transition in order to guarantee a well-posed initial value
problem of the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics, and study the
dynamics of non-rotating or rotating unstable twin stars via 3-dimensional
simulations in full general relativity. We find that unstable twin stars
naturally migrate toward the hadronic branch. Before settling into the hadronic
regime, these stars undergo (quasi)radial oscillations on a dynamical timescale
while the core bounces between the two phases. Our study suggests that it may
be difficult to form stable twin stars if the phase transition is sustained
over a large jump in energy density, and hence it may be more likely that
astrophysical hybrid hadron-quark stars have masses above the twin star regime.
We also study the minimum-mass instability for hybrid stars, and find that
these configurations do not explode, unlike the minimum-mass instability for
neutron stars. Additionally, our results suggest that oscillations between the
two Quantum Chromodynamic phases could provide gravitational wave signals
associated with such phase transitions in core-collapse supernovae and white
dwarf-neutron star mergers.

stars of the host galaxy. The strength of the $m=1$ lopsidedness undergoes a
transient amplification phase after each pericenter passage of the satellite,
in concordance with past findings of exciting an $m=1$ lopsidedness by tidal
encounters. However, once the merger happens, and the post-merger remnant
readjusts itself, the lopsidedness disappears in short time-scale ($\sim$
500-850 Myr). Furthermore, a delayed merger can drive a prolonged ($\sim$2 Gyr)
lopsidedness in the host galaxy. We demonstrate that the $m=1$ lopsidedness
rotates with a well-defined pattern speed which is much slower than the $m=2$
bar pattern speed, and is retrograde with respect to the bar. This gives rise
to a dynamical scenario where the Inner Lindblad resonance of the $m=1$
lopsidedness falls in between the corotation and the Outer Lindblad resonance
of the $m=2$ bar mode. A kinematic lopsidedness also arises in the host galaxy;
the resulting temporal variation closely follows that of the density
lopsidedness. The minor merger also triggers a transient off-centred stellar
disc-dark matter halo configuration due to the tidal encounter with the
satellite.

antiferromagnet in the spin-trimer basis are sign-problem-free when the

at finite temperatures and terminates in a thermal critical point. The trimer

an extensive entropy jump at the quantum transition, which alters the shape of

the vicinity of the critical point, which include profound changes in the lines

differential excitation rates by the left- and right-circular orientations of a

considering three kinds of semimetals with pseudospin values of 1/2, 1, and

investigate the effects of tilt and anisotropy on the systems, and find that

dark-matter haloes on their assembly histories at fixed halo mass. This
established dependence is expected to manifest itself on the clustering of the
galaxy population, a potential effect commonly known as galaxy assembly bias.
Using the IllustrisTNG300 magnetohydrodynamical simulation, we analyse the
dependence of the properties and clustering of galaxies on the shape of the
specific mass accretion history of their hosting haloes (sMAH). We first show
that several halo and galaxy properties strongly correlate with the slope of
the sMAH ($\beta$) at fixed halo mass. Namely, haloes with increasingly steeper
$\beta$ increment their halo masses faster at early times, and their hosted
galaxies present larger stellar-to-halo mass ratios, lose their gas faster,
reach the peak of their star formation histories at higher redshift, and become
quenched earlier. We also demonstrate that $\beta$ is more directly connected
to these key galaxy formation properties than other broadly employed halo
proxies, such as formation time. Finally, we measure the secondary dependence
of galaxy clustering on $\beta$ at fixed halo mass as a function of redshift.
By tracing back the evolution of individual haloes, we show that the amplitude
of the galaxy assembly bias signal for the progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies
increases with redshift, reaching a factor of 2 at $z = 1$ for haloes of
$M_\mathrm{halo}=10^{11.5}-10^{12}$ $h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The measurement
of the evolution of assembly bias along the merger tree provides a new
theoretical perspective to the study of secondary bias. Our findings, which

related aspects of the interaction energies between the alkali atoms and the

of cosmological axions, exploiting magnetic-type transitions between Zeeman
sublevels of alkali atoms in a magnetic field, tuned to the axion mass, assumed
in the meV range. Axions are one of the supposed constituents of the dark

for the experimental search of new physics beyond the Standard Model, in

parity-charge-conjugation (CP) symmetry. In order to efficiently resolve the
axion-induced transition in alkali-doped solid matrices, it is necessary to
reduce as much as possible the spectral linewidth of the electronic transitions
involved. The theoretical investigation presented in this paper aims to
estimate the order of magnitude of the inhomogeneous contribution to the
linewidth due to the alkali--matrix interactions (Coulomb/exchange and
dispersion), and to compare the theoretical results with our experimental
measurements of spectra of dilute Rubidium atoms in Argon and Neon solid

inward at a rate that differs from the Type II prediction. Here we show that at
higher masses, planets migrate outward. Our result differs from previous ones
because of our longer simulation times, lower viscosity, and our boundary
conditions that allow the disk to reach viscous steady state. We show that, for
planets on circular orbits, the transition from inward to outward migration
coincides with the known transition from circular to eccentric disks that
occurs for planets more massive than a few Jupiters. In an eccentric disk, the
torque on the outer disk weakens due to two effects: the planet launches weaker
waves, and those waves travel further before damping. As a result, the torque
on the inner disk dominates, and the planet pushes itself outward. Our results
suggest that the many super-Jupiters observed by direct-imaging at large
distances from the star may have gotten there by outward migration.

high entropy alloys (HEAs), which plays an important role in guiding HEA
designs in materials science. While first principles simulations can capture
magnetic moments of individual atoms, explicit models are required to analyze
their interactions. This is essentially an inverse covariance matrix estimation
problem. Unlike most of the literature on graphical models, the inverse
covariance matrix possesses inherent structural constraints encompassing node
types, topological distance of nodes, and partially specified conditional
dependence patterns. The present article is, to our knowledge, the first to
consider such intricate structures in graphical models. In particular, we
introduce graph constraints to formulate these structures that arise from
domain knowledge and are critical for interpretability, which leads to a
Bayesian conditional autoregressive model with graph constraints (CARGO) for
structured inverse covariance matrices. The CARGO method enjoys efficient
implementation with a modified Gauss-Seidel scheme through proximity operators
for closed-form posterior exploration. We establish algorithmic convergence for
the proposed algorithm under a verifiable stopping criterion. Simulations show
competitive performance of CARGO relative to several other methods and confirm
our convergence analysis. In a novel real data application to HEAs, the
proposed methods lead to data-driven quantification and interpretation of
magnetic moment interactions with high tractability and transferability.

belong to the so-called island of inversion (IOI), a region of the nuclear
chart around $Z=10$ and $N=20$ where nuclear structure deviates from the
standard shell model predictions due to deformation and continuum effects.
However, while the general principles leading to the IOI are relatively well
understood, the details of the low-lying structure of the exotic fluorine
isotopes $^{28-33}$F are basically unknown. In this work, we perform
large-scale shell model calculations including continuum states to investigate
the properties of the neutron-rich isotopes $^{25-33}$F, using a core of
$^{24}$O and an effective two-body interaction with only three adjustable
parameters. We adjust the core potential and interaction on experimentally
confirmed states in $^{25,26}$O and $^{25-27}$F and solve the many-body problem
using the density matrix renormalization group method for open quantum systems
in a $sd$-$fp$ model space. We obtain the first detailed spectroscopy of
$^{25-33}$F in the continuum and show how the interplay between continuum
effects and deformation explains the recent data on $^{28,29}$F, and produces
an inversion of the ${5/2}^+$ and ${1/2}^+$ states in $^{29,31,33}$F. Several
deformed one- and two-neutron halo states are predicted in $^{29,31}$F, and we
predict the ground state of $^{30}$F to have a structure similar to that of the
first ${5/2}^+$ state of $^{29}$F. We also suggest several experimental studies
to constraint models and test the present predictions. The complex structure of
neutron-rich fluorine isotopes offers a trove of information about the
formation of the southern shore of the IOI through a subtle interplay of
deformation and continuum couplings driven by the occupation of the
quasi-degenerate neutron shells $0d_{3/2}$ and $1p_{3/2}$.

Solving the corresponding POMDP problem is a very challenging task,

approach, Simplified Information Theoretic Belief Space Planning (SITH-BSP),
which aims to speed-up POMDP planning considering belief-dependent rewards,
without compromising on the solution's accuracy. We do so by mathematically
relating the simplified elements of the problem to the corresponding
counterparts of the original problem. Specifically, we focus on belief
simplification and use it to formulate bounds on the corresponding original
belief-dependent rewards. These bounds in turn are used to perform branch
pruning over the belief tree, in the process of calculating the optimal policy.
We further introduce the notion of adaptive simplification, while re-using
calculations between different simplification levels and exploit it to prune,
at each level in the belief tree, all branches but one. Therefore, our approach
is guaranteed to find the optimal solution of the original problem but with
substantial speedup. As a second key contribution, we derive novel analytical
bounds for differential entropy, considering a sampling-based belief
representation, which we believe are of interest on their own. We validate our
approach in simulation using these bounds and where simplification corresponds
to reducing the number of samples, exhibiting a significant computational

populations. One of them, featuring blue colours, is actively forming stars,
while the other is made up of ""red-and-dead"" objects with negligible star
formation. Yet, are these galaxies really dead? Here we would like to highlight
that, as previously reported by several independent groups, state-of-the-art
cosmological numerical simulations predict the existence of a large number of
quenched galaxies that have not formed any star over the last few Gyr. In
contrast, observational measurements of large galaxy samples in the nearby
Universe suggest that even the most passive systems still form stars at some
residual level close to $sSFR\sim10^{-12}~\text{yr}^{-1}$. Unfortunately,
extremely low star formation poses a challenge for both approaches. We conclude
that, at present, the fraction of truly dead galaxies is still an important
open question that must be addressed in order to understand galaxy formation
and evolution.

behavior. Methods that estimate 3D bodies, faces, or hands have progressed
significantly, yet separately. Face methods recover accurate 3D shape and
geometric details, but need a tight crop and struggle with extreme views and
low resolution. Whole-body methods are robust to a wide range of poses and
resolutions, but provide only a rough 3D face shape without details like
wrinkles. To get the best of both worlds, we introduce PIXIE, which produces
animatable, whole-body 3D avatars with realistic facial detail, from a single
image. For this, PIXIE uses two key observations. First, existing work combines
independent estimates from body, face, and hand experts, by trusting them
equally. PIXIE introduces a novel moderator that merges the features of the
experts, weighted by their confidence. All part experts can contribute to the
whole, using SMPL-X's shared shape space across all body parts. Second, human
shape is highly correlated with gender, but existing work ignores this. We
label training images as male, female, or non-binary, and train PIXIE to infer
""gendered"" 3D body shapes with a novel shape loss. In addition to 3D body pose
and shape parameters, PIXIE estimates expression, illumination, albedo and 3D
facial surface displacements. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation shows
that PIXIE estimates more accurate whole-body shape and detailed face shape
than the state of the art. Models and code are available at

focus acoustic energy, and make measurements correlated with damage in a
variety of industrial materials. Most studies using TR-NEWS in Earth Science
have focused on relatively small objects and may have multiple acoustic
sources. In Earth, within energy extraction settings, the structure and scale
of wellbores makes acoustic focusing challenging. This paper explores the
feasibility of applying TR NEWS for damage detection in wellbores by
constructing a laboratory-scale wellbore, and using TR to focus and make
dynamic linear and nonlinear elastic measurements. After successive cycles of
induced, localized mechanical damage the sample, the hysteretic nonlinear
elastic parameter {\alpha}, increased with damage cycle indicating progressive
mechanical damage. In addition to these strain-dependent changes, TR peak width
and changes to peak amplitude near the damage sites was also observed. To
deploy TR in a wellbore, it will be necessary to choose sensors that are
suitable for the environment, and that can be distributed along the wellbore.
Thus, this paper demonstrates that acoustic TR can be conducted using both an
intrinsic Fabry Perot interferometer fiber optic strain sensor, and an
intrinsic Michaelson interferometer fiber optic strain sensor, as a first step
towards deployable sensing for TR in a wellbore.

  Tradeoff Curve","42 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.GT cs.SY eess.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of dividing limited resources to individuals arriving
over $T$ rounds. Each round has a random number of individuals arrive, and
individuals can be characterized by their type (i.e. preferences over the
different resources). A standard notion of 'fairness' in this setting is that
an allocation simultaneously satisfy envy-freeness and efficiency. The former
is an individual guarantee, requiring that each agent prefers their own
allocation over the allocation of any other; in contrast, efficiency is a
global property, requiring that the allocations clear the available resources.
For divisible resources, when the number of individuals of each type are known
upfront, the above desiderata are simultaneously achievable for a large class
of utility functions. However, in an online setting when the number of
individuals of each type are only revealed round by round, no policy can
guarantee these desiderata simultaneously, and hence the best one can do is to
try and allocate so as to approximately satisfy the two properties.
  We show that in the online setting, the two desired properties (envy-freeness
and efficiency) are in direct contention, in that any algorithm achieving
additive counterfactual envy-freeness up to a factor of $L_T$ necessarily
suffers a efficiency loss of at least $1 / L_T$. We complement this uncertainty
principle with a simple algorithm, HopeGuardrail, which allocates resources
based on an adaptive threshold policy and is able to achieve any
fairness-efficiency point on this frontier. In simulation results, our
algorithm provides allocations close to the optimal fair solution in hindsight,
motivating its use in practical applications as the algorithm is able to adapt
to any desired fairness efficiency trade-off.

We present a study of this relation in a complete, volume-limited sample of
nine of the most luminous ($\log L_{\rm 14-195 keV} > 10^{42.5}$ erg/s) local
AGNs (the LLAMA sample), including a sample of 18 inactive control galaxies (6

$\lesssim$ log M_star/M_sun $\lesssim$ 10.5), inclination and distance. This
allows us to calibrate our methods on the control sample and perform a
differential analysis between the AGN and control samples. We perform stellar
population synthesis on VLT/X-SHOOTER spectra in an aperture corresponding to a
physical radius of $\approx$ 150 pc. We find young ($\lesssim$ 30 Myr) stellar
populations in seven out of nine AGNs and in four out of six star-forming
control galaxies. In the non-star-forming control population, in contrast, only
two out of twelve galaxies show such a population. We further show that these
young populations are not indicative of ongoing star-formation, providing
evidence for models that see AGN activity as a consequence of nuclear star
formation. Based on the similar nuclear star-formation histories of AGNs and
star-forming control galaxies, we speculate that the latter may turn into the
former for some fraction of their time. Under this assumption, and making use
of the volume-completeness of our sample, we infer that the AGN phase lasts for

System and beyond is critical to evaluate the potential habitability of rocky
planets. Whether the inner Solar System planets accreted these volatiles from
their inception or had an exogenous delivery from the outer Solar System is,
however, not well understood. Using previously published data of
nucleosynthetic anomalies of Ni, Mo, W and Ru in iron meteorites along with
their 15N-14N ratios, here we show that the earliest formed protoplanets in the
inner and outer protoplanetary disk accreted isotopically distinct N. While the
Sun and Jupiter captured N from nebular gas, concomitantly growing protoplanets
in the inner and outer disk possibly sourced their N from organics and/or dust
- with each reservoir having a different N isotopic composition. A distinct N
isotopic signature of the inner Solar System protoplanets coupled with their
rapid accretion suggests that non-nebular, isotopically processed N was
ubiquitous in their growth zone at 0-0.3 Myr after the formation of CAIs.
Because 15N-14N ratio of the bulk silicate Earth falls between that of inner
and outer Solar System reservoirs, we infer that N in the present-day rocky
planets represents a mixture of both inner and outer Solar System material.

maximum power-point estimation (MPPE) with flexible power-point tracking (FPPT)
control to improve the performance of both algorithms, achieving fast and
accurate PV power-setpoint tracking even under rapid solar irradiance changes.
The MPPE is developed using a real-time, nonlinear curve-fitting approach based
on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. A modified adaptive FPPT based on the
Perturb and Observe technique is developed for the power-setpoint tracking. By
using MPPE to decouple the impact of irradiance changes on the measured PV
output power, we develop a fast convergence technique for tracking
power-reference changes within three FPPT iterations. Furthermore, to limit the
maximum output power ripple, a new design is introduced for the steady-state
voltage step size of the adaptive FPPT. The proposed algorithm is implemented
on a testbed consisting of a 500 kVA three-phase, single-stage, utility-scale
PV system on the OPAL-RT eMEGASIM platform. Results show that the proposed

various data loading delays. For example, a location-disease-time tensor of
case counts can have multiple delayed updates of recent temporal slices for
some locations or diseases. Recovering such missing or noisy (under-reported)
elements of the input tensor can be viewed as a generalized tensor completion
problem. Existing tensor completion methods usually assume that i) missing

We model such dynamic data as a multi-version tensor with an extra tensor mode

early times after a collision of relativistic heavy ions at proper time

in $\tau$. The full details of our method are described in our previous paper
[1]. In this paper we present an analysis of various physical quantities that
can be obtained from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that the expansion to
order $\tau^6$ can be trusted to about $\tau=0.05$ fm. For times small enough
that the expansion converges, the transverse and longitudinal pressures move
towards their equilibrium values of one third of the energy density. The
Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal flow are larger than expected, which
contradicts the usual assumption that anisotropy is mostly generated during the
hydrodynamic evolution of the plasma. We find a significant correlation between
the elliptic flow coefficient and the eccentricity, which indicates that the
spatial asymmetry introduced by the initial geometry is effectively transmitted
to the azimuthal distribution of the gluon momentum field, even at very early
times. This result is interesting because correlations of this kind are
characteristic of the onset of hydrodynamic behaviour. We show that the angular
momentum of the glasma is orders of magnitude smaller than the angular momentum
of the initial system of ions colliding with non-zero impact parameter. This
indicates that most of the angular momentum carried by the valence quarks is
not transmitted to the glasma, and contradicts the picture of a rapidly
rotating initial glasma state that has been proposed by several authors, but
agrees with the current lack of experimental evidence for a significant

scores for a machine learning model, as a way to understand which features are
the most relevant for making predictions. Given the significance of feature
selection, it is crucial for the calculated importance scores to reflect
reality. Falsely overestimating the importance of irrelevant features can lead
to false discoveries, while underestimating importance of relevant features may
lead us to discard important features, resulting in poor model performance.
Additionally, black-box models like XGBoost provide state-of-the art predictive
performance, but cannot be easily understood by humans, and thus we rely on
variable importance scores or methods for explainability like SHAP to offer
insight into their behavior.
  In this paper, we investigate the performance of variable importance as a
feature selection method across various black-box and interpretable machine
learning methods. We compare the ability of CART, Optimal Trees, XGBoost and
SHAP to correctly identify the relevant subset of variables across a number of

between relevant and irrelevant features. On the other hand, the interpretable
methods are able to correctly and efficiently identify irrelevant features, and
thus offer significantly better performance for feature selection.

comparisons under the above problems. Following the approaches, in particular,
a robust large sample test on equality of two parameters of interest (e.g., a
test of equality of inequality measures in two regions or countries considered)
is conducted as follows: The data in the two samples dealt with is partitioned
into fixed numbers $q_1, q_2\ge 2$ (e.g., $q_1=q_2=2, 4, 8$) of groups, the
parameters (inequality measures dealt with) are estimated for each group, and
inference is based on a standard two-sample $t-$test with the resulting $q_1,
q_2$ group estimators. Robust $t-$statistic approaches result in valid
inference under general conditions that group estimators of parameters (e.g.,
inequality measures) considered are asymptotically independent, unbiased and
Gaussian of possibly different variances, or weakly converge, at an arbitrary
rate, to independent scale mixtures of normal random variables. These
conditions are typically satisfied in empirical applications even under
pronounced heavy-tailedness and heterogeneity and possible dependence in

a computationally tractable convex optimization problem. The simulation results

entropy accumulation, and carry out the whole proof using the R\'enyi entropy,

human-machine/computer-interaction applications. However, the high cost and low
portability/wearability of haptic devices remain unresolved issues, severely
limiting the adoption of this otherwise promising technology. Electrotactile
interfaces have the advantage of being more portable and wearable due to their
reduced actuators' size, as well as their lower power consumption and
manufacturing cost. The applications of electrotactile feedback have been
explored in human-computer interaction and human-machine-interaction for
facilitating hand-based interactions in applications such as prosthetics,
virtual reality, robotic teleoperation, surface haptics, portable devices, and
rehabilitation. This paper presents a technological overview of electrotactile
feedback, as well a systematic review and meta-analysis of its applications for
hand-based interactions. We discuss the different electrotactile systems
according to the type of application. We also discuss over a quantitative
congregation of the findings, to offer a high-level overview into the
state-of-art and suggest future directions. Electrotactile feedback systems
showed increased portability/wearability, and they were successful in rendering
and/or augmenting most tactile sensations, eliciting perceptual processes, and
improving performance in many scenarios. However, knowledge gaps (e.g.,
embodiment), technical (e.g., recurrent calibration, electrodes' durability)
and methodological (e.g., sample size) drawbacks were detected, which should be
addressed in future studies.

The continuum was consistent with a dominant component originating in the

between 810,000 K and a million K, and mass in the 1.2-1.4 M$_\odot$ range. A
moderate blue shift of the absorption features of a few hundred km s$^{-1}$ can
be explained with a residual nova wind depleting the WD surface at a rate of
about 10$^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The emission spectrum seems to be due to
both photoionization and shock ionization in the ejecta. The supersoft X-ray

amplitude of the variability. We find that both the period and the amplitude of
another, already known 33.3 s modulation, varied within timescales of hours. We

frames, with the aim of providing a smooth and consistent visual experience.
Two approaches for solving this challenging task are optical flow based and
kernel-based methods. In existing works, optical flow based methods can provide
accurate point-to-point motion description, however, they lack constraints on
object structure. On the contrary, kernel-based methods focus on structural
alignment, which relies on semantic and apparent features, but tends to blur
results. Based on these observations, we propose a structure-motion based
iterative fusion method. The framework is an end-to-end learnable structure
with two stages. First, interpolated frames are synthesized by structure-based
and motion-based learning branches respectively, then, an iterative refinement
module is established via spatial and temporal feature integration. Inspired by
the observation that audiences have different visual preferences on foreground

results on three typical benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves
superior performance on all evaluation metrics over the state-of-the-art

energy to be treated as physically real, even in static fields. This motivates
the conjecture that field momentum might be due to the flow of a relativistic
mass density (defined as energy density divided by the square of the speed of
light). This article investigates the velocity of such a mass flow and finds a
conflict between two different definitions of it, both of which originally seem
plausible if the flow is to be taken as real. This investigation is careful to
respect the transformation rules of special relativity throughout. The paper
demonstrates that the consensus definition of the flow velocity of
electromagnetic energy is inconsistent with the transformation rules of special
relativity, and hence is incorrect. A replacement flow velocity is derived
which is completely consistent with those transformation rules. The conclusion
is that these conflicting definitions of flow velocity cannot be resolved in a
way that is consistent with special relativity and also allows electromagnetic
field momentum density to be the result of relativistic mass flow. Though real,
field momentum density cannot be explained as the flow of a relativistic mass
density. As a byproduct of the study, it is also shown that there is a comoving
system in which the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor is reduced to a
simple diagonal form, with two of its diagonal elements equal to the energy
density and the other two diagonal elements equal to plus and minus a single
parameter derived from the electromagnetic field values, a result that places
constraints on possible fluid models of electromagnetism.

achieve to handle the limited spatio-temporal observations. Then, by
introducing a set of Kalman filters running in parallel, we mitigate the

for Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Many Hamilton-Jacobi equations have a nonlinear
dependency on the gradient, which gives rise to discontinuities in the
derivatives of the solution, resulting in kinks. We built our solver with two
goals in mind: 1) high order accuracy in smooth regions and 2) sharp resolution
of kinks. To achieve this, we use Hermite interpolation with a smoothness
sensor. The degrees-of freedom of Hermite methods are tensor-product Taylor
polynomials of degree $m$ in each coordinate direction. The method uses
$(m+1)^d$ degrees of freedom per node in $d$-dimensions and achieves an order
of accuracy $(2m+1)$ when the solution is smooth. To obtain sharp resolution of
kinks, we sense the smoothness of the solution on each cell at each timestep.
If the solution is smooth, we march the interpolant forward in time with no
modifications. When our method encounters a cell over which the solution is not
smooth, it introduces artificial viscosity locally while proceeding normally in
smooth regions. We show through numerical experiments that the solver sharply
captures kinks once the solution losses continuity in the derivative while
achieving $2m+1$ order accuracy in smooth regions.

lattices of variable dimensions in a time-optimal manner. We systematically
analyze the intrinsic optimality structure, which is fairly rich and
intriguing, under different levels of item distinguishability (fully labeled,
where each item has a unique label, or partially labeled, where multiple items
may be of the same type) and different lattice dimensions. Focusing on the most
practical setting of one and two dimensions, we develop low polynomial time
cycle-following-based algorithms that optimally perform rearrangements on 1D

we show that rearrangement on 2D and higher-dimensional lattices become
computationally intractable to optimally solve. Despite their NP-hardness, we
prove that efficient cycle-following-based algorithms remain optimal in the
asymptotic sense for 2D fully- and partially-labeled settings, in expectation,

of cycles. We further improve these algorithms to provide $1.x$-optimality when

endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance $d_\mathcal{GH}$ is known to be a

geodesics in $\mathcal{M}$. In this paper we provide two such
characterizations. We first prove that every Gromov-Hausdorff geodesic is in
fact a geodesic in the Hausdorff hyperspace of some compact metric space, which
we call a Hausdorff geodesic. Inspired by this characterization, we further
elucidate a structural connection between Hausdorff geodesics and Wasserstein
geodesics: every Hausdorff geodesic is equivalent to a so-called Hausdorff
displacement interpolation. This equivalence allows us to establish that every
Gromov-Hausdorff geodesic is dynamic, a notion which we develop in analogy with
dynamic optimal couplings in the theory of optimal transport.
  Besides geodesics in $\mathcal{M}$, we also study geodesics on the collection
$\mathcal{M}^w$ of isomorphism classes of compact metric measure spaces. Sturm
constructed a family of Gromov-type distances on $\mathcal{M}^w$, which we

uncertainties from the model, code, and data while simultaneously
characterizing the uncertain distributions in the input parameters--rather than
merely providing best-fit point estimates. We employ measurement data on melt

sample of n i.i.d. K-dimensional vectors of binary indicators, where the k-th
component of each vector indicates the subject being caught by the k-th sample,
such that only subjects with nonzero capture vectors are observed. The target
quantity is the unconditional probability of the vector being nonzero across
both observed and unobserved subjects. We cover models assuming a single
constraint (identification assumption) on the K-dimensional distribution such
that the target quantity is identified and the statistical model is
unrestricted. We present solutions for linear and non-linear constraints
commonly assumed to identify capture-recapture models, including no K-way
interaction in linear and log-linear models, independence or conditional
independence. We demonstrate that the choice of constraint has a dramatic
impact on the value of the estimand, showing that it is crucial that the
constraint is known to hold by design. For the commonly assumed constraint of
no K-way interaction in a log-linear model, the statistical target parameter is
only defined when each of the $2^K - 1$ observable capture patterns is present,
and therefore suffers from the curse of dimensionality. We propose a targeted
MLE based on undersmoothed lasso model to smooth across the cells while
targeting the fit towards the single valued target parameter of interest. For
each identification assumption, we provide simulated inference and confidence
intervals to assess the performance on the estimator under correct and
incorrect identifying assumptions. We apply the proposed method, alongside
existing estimators, to estimate prevalence of a parasitic infection using
multi-source surveillance data from a region in southwestern China, under the
four identification assumptions.

like a non-hostile one in order not to reveal its identity to an opponent. To
model such a scenario, we define identity concealment games: zero-sum
stochastic reachability games with a zero-sum objective of identity
concealment. To measure the identity concealment of the player, we introduce
the notion of an average player. The average player's policy represents the
expected behavior of a non-hostile player. We show that there exists an
equilibrium policy pair for every identity concealment game and give the
optimality equations to synthesize an equilibrium policy pair. If the player's
opponent follows a non-equilibrium policy, the player can hide its identity
better. For this reason, we study how the hostile player may learn the
opponent's policy. Since learning via exploration policies would quickly reveal
the hostile player's identity to the opponent, we consider the problem of
learning a near-optimal policy for the hostile player using the game runs
collected under the average player's policy. Consequently, we propose an
algorithm that provably learns a near-optimal policy and give an upper bound on
the number of sample runs to be collected.

tunable $ZZ$ interaction between two transmon qubits with fixed frequencies and
fixed coupling, induced by driving both transmons off-resonantly. We show
tunable coupling over one order of magnitude larger than the static coupling,
and change the sign of the interaction, enabling cancellation of the idle
coupling. Further, this interaction is amenable to large quantum processors:
the drive frequency can be flexibly chosen to avoid spurious transitions, and
because both transmons are driven, it is resilient to microwave crosstalk. We
apply this interaction to implement a controlled phase (CZ) gate with a gate
fidelity of $99.43(1)\%$ as measured by cycle benchmarking, and we find the

non-chord tones (i.e., notes outside the supporting harmony) contribute to
error during the labeling process. Despite the prevalence of machine learning
approaches in MIR, there are cases where alternative approaches provide a
simpler alternative while allowing for insights into musicological practices.
In this project, we present a statistical model for predicting chord tones
based on music theory rules. Our model is currently focused on predicting chord
tones in classical music, since composition in this style is highly
constrained, theoretically making the placement of chord tones highly
predictable. Indeed, music theorists have labeling systems for every variety of
non-chord tone, primarily classified by the note's metric position and
intervals of approach and departure. Using metric position, duration, and
melodic intervals as predictors, we build a statistical model for predicting
chord tones using the TAVERN dataset. While our probabilistic approach is
similar to other efforts in the domain of automatic harmonic analysis, our
focus is on melodic reduction rather than predicting harmony. However, we hope
to pursue applications for ACE in the future. Finally, we implement our melody
reduction model using an existing symbolic visualization tool, to assist with
melody reduction and non-chord tone identification for computational musicology

decisions on interventions because those models find correlations - not causal
relationships. If observational data is only available and experimentation are
infeasible, the correct approach to study the impact of an intervention is to
invoke Pearl's causality framework. Even that framework assumes that the
underlying causal graph is known, which is seldom the case in practice. When
the causal structure is not known, one may use out-of-the-box algorithms to
find causal dependencies from observational data. However, there exists no
method that also accounts for the decision-maker's prior knowledge when
developing the causal structure either. The objective of this paper is to
develop rational approaches for making decisions from observational data in the
presence of causal graph uncertainty and prior knowledge from the
decision-maker. We use ensemble methods like Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to
infer set of causal graphs that can represent the data generation process. We
provide decisions by computing the expected value and risk of potential
interventions explicitly. We demonstrate our approach by applying them in

Energetic particles are effectively scattered due to the field-line curvature,
which then leads to isotropization of energetic particle distributions and
particle precipitation to the Earth's atmosphere. Measurements of these
precipitation at low-altitude spacecraft are thus often used to remotely probe
the magnetotail current sheet configuration. This configuration may include
spatially localized maxima of the curvature radius at equator (due to localized
humps of the equatorial magnetic field magnitude) that reduce the energetic
particle scattering and precipitation. Therefore, the measured precipitation
patterns are related to the spatial distribution of the equatorial curvature
radius that is determined by the magnetotail current sheet configuration. In
this study, we show that, contrary to previous thoughts, the magnetic field
line configuration with the localized curvature radius maximum can actually
enhance the scattering and subsequent precipitation. The spatially localized
magnetic field dipolarization (magnetic field humps) can significantly curve
magnetic field lines far from the equator and create off-equatorial minima in
the curvature radius. Scattering of energetic particles in these off-equatorial
regions alters the scattering (and precipitation) patterns, which has not been

for solving the Kirchhoff-Love plate model in domains with complex geometries.
The algorithms proposed here employ curvilinear finite-difference methods for
spatial discretization of the governing PDEs on general composite overlapping
grids. The coupling of different components of the composite overlapping grid
is through numerical interpolations. However, interpolations introduce
perturbation to the finite-difference discretization, which causes numerical
instability for time-stepping schemes used to advance the resulted
semi-discrete system. To address the instability, we propose to add a
fourth-order hyper-dissipation to the spatially discretized system to stabilize
its time integration; this additional dissipation term captures the essential
upwinding effect of the original upwind scheme. The investigation of strategies
for incorporating the upwind dissipation term into several time-stepping
schemes (both explicit and implicit) leads to the development of four novel
algorithms. For each algorithm, formulas for determining a stable time step and
a sufficient dissipation coefficient on curvilinear grids are derived by
performing a local Fourier analysis. Quadratic eigenvalue problems for a
simplified model plate in 1D domain are considered to reveal the weak
instability due to the presence of interpolating equations in the spatial
discretization. This model problem is further investigated for the
stabilization effects of the proposed algorithms. Carefully designed numerical
experiments are carried out to validate the accuracy and stability of the
proposed algorithms, followed by two benchmark problems to demonstrate the
capability and efficiency of our approach for solving realistic applications.

intensive anchors, which efficiently capture various lanes. Next, multi-level
structural constraints are used to improve the perception of lanes. In the
process, pixel-level perception with binary segmentation is introduced to
promote features around anchors and restore lane details from bottom up, a
lane-level relation is put forward to model structures (i.e., parallel) around

distributed parameter systems using neural networks and shape optimization.
Sensors with various shapes are placed on the domain of the distributed
parameter system. Data provided by these sensors are fed into a re-constructor
to generate a full state of the system. After that, a trained neural-network
predictor produces a prediction of the state at future time steps. The cost of
prediction is defined as the weighted sensor area plus the squared norm of the
prediction error. The location and shape of a sensor influences the prediction
cost as well as the predictor performance. With the aid of the gradient of the
network with respect to its inputs, an outer optimization layer is augmented to
find optimized locations and shapes of the sensors. Simulation results show
good agreement between the predicted and the true states as well as a
significant reduction in cost by sensors with optimized locations and shapes.

housed the principal telescopes for his early and late observations: a 3.5-inch
astronomical telescope and a Reichenbach 4-feet achromatic erecting telescope,
respectively. We identified 215 days of datable sunspot observations, which are
twice as much data as his estimated data in the existing database (= 115 days).
Prantner counted up to 7--9 sunspot groups per day and measured sunspot
positions, which show their distributions in both solar hemispheres. These
results strikingly emphasise the difference between the Dalton Minimum and the
Maunder Minimum as well as the similarity between the Dalton Minimum and the

health-related applications such as estimating food calories and nutrients.
Existing food image segmentation models are underperforming due to two reasons:
(1) there is a lack of high quality food image datasets with fine-grained
ingredient labels and pixel-wise location masks -- the existing datasets either
carry coarse ingredient labels or are small in size; and (2) the complex
appearance of food makes it difficult to localize and recognize ingredients in
food images, e.g., the ingredients may overlap one another in the same image,
and the identical ingredient may appear distinctly in different food images. In
this work, we build a new food image dataset FoodSeg103 (and its extension
FoodSeg154) containing 9,490 images. We annotate these images with 154
ingredient classes and each image has an average of 6 ingredient labels and
pixel-wise masks. In addition, we propose a multi-modality pre-training
approach called ReLeM that explicitly equips a segmentation model with rich and
semantic food knowledge. In experiments, we use three popular semantic
segmentation methods (i.e., Dilated Convolution based, Feature Pyramid based,
and Vision Transformer based) as baselines, and evaluate them as well as ReLeM
on our new datasets. We believe that the FoodSeg103 (and its extension
FoodSeg154) and the pre-trained models using ReLeM can serve as a benchmark to
facilitate future works on fine-grained food image understanding. We make all

two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity corresponds to the unbinding of
vortex-antivortex pairs with the quasi-long-range order (quasi-LRO) in the
order-parameter phase field, described by the Berezinskii-Kosterlizt-Thouless
(BKT) transition of a 2D XY model. Here we show that the second-order Josephson
coupling can induce an exotic superconducting phase in a bilayer system. By
using tensor-network methods, the partition function of the 2D classical model
is expressed as a product of 1D quantum transfer operator, whose eigen-equation
can be solved by an algorithm of matrix product states rigorously. From the
singularity shown by the entanglement entropy of the 1D quantum analogue,
various phase transitions can be accurately determined. Below the BKT phase
transition, an inter-layer Ising long-range order is established at
$T_{Ising}$, and the phase coherence of both intra-layers and inter-layers is
locked together. For two identical layers, the Ising transition coincides with
the BKT transition at a multi-critical point. For two inequivalent layers,
however, there emerges an intermediate quasi-LRO phase ($T_{Ising}<T<T_{BKT}$),
where the vortex-antivortex bindings occur in the layer with the larger
intra-layer coupling, but only half-vortex pairs with topological strings exist
in the other layer, corresponding to the phase coherence of pairs of Cooper
pairs. So our study provides a promising way to realize the charge-4e
superconductivity in a bilayer system.

reduced basis method and the generalized multiscale finite element method
(GMsFEM). Due to incomplete characterization of the medium properties of the
groundwater flow problems, random variables are used to parameterize the
uncertainty. As a result, solving the problem repeatedly is required to obtain
statistical quantities. Besides, the medium properties are usually highly
heterogeneous, which will result in a large linear system that needs to be
solved. Therefore, it is intrinsically inevitable to seek a
computational-efficient model reduction method to overcome the difficulty. We
will explore the combination of the reduced basis method and the GMsFEM. In
particular, we will use residual-driven basis functions, which are key
ingredients in GMsFEM. This local-global multiscale method is more efficient
than applying the GMsFEM or reduced basis method individually. We first
construct parameter-independent multiscale basis functions that include both
local and global information of the permeability fields, and then use these
basis functions to construct several global snapshots and global basis
functions for fast online computation with different parameter inputs. We
provide rigorous analysis of the proposed method and extensive numerical
examples to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the local-global
multiscale method.

self-consistent calculation employing the non-equilibrium Green's function
(NEGF) method. With the strain distribution and band profile determined, a
multi-band transfer-matrix method (TMM) is used to calculate the tunneling
coefficients of optically-pumped carriers in the absorbing region. The
photocurrent spectra contributed by both single-photon absorption (SPA) and

weighted by the carrier tunneling rate and the photon density-of-state (DOS) in
the optical cavity formed in the nanowire region to produce the photocurrent.
The calculated photocurrent spectra is in good agreement with experimental
data, while physical mechanisms for the observed prominent peaks are identified

developed. The focus of HCI work is transiting from conventional human
interaction with non-AI computing systems to interaction with AI systems. We
conducted a high-level literature review and a holistic analysis of current
work in developing AI systems from an HCI perspective. Our review and analysis
highlight the new changes introduced by AI technology and the new challenges
that HCI professionals face when applying the human-centered AI (HCAI) approach
in the development of AI systems. We also identified seven main issues in human
interaction with AI systems, which HCI professionals did not encounter when
developing non-AI computing systems. To further enable the implementation of
the HCAI approach, we identified new HCI opportunities tied to specific
HCAI-driven design goals to guide HCI professionals in addressing these new
issues. Finally, our assessment of current HCI methods shows the limitations of
these methods in support of developing AI systems. We propose alternative
methods that can help overcome these limitations and effectively help HCI
professionals apply the HCAI approach to the development of AI systems. We also
offer strategic recommendations for HCI professionals to effectively influence
the development of AI systems with the HCAI approach, eventually developing
HCAI systems.

the process economy, in contrast to traditional process operations around
predetermined equilibriums. In this paper, a contraction theory-based control
approach using neural networks is developed for nonlinear chemical processes to
achieve time-varying reference tracking. This approach leverages the universal
approximation characteristics of neural networks with discrete-time contraction

contraction metric and differential feedback gain, that is embedded in a
contraction-based controller. A second, separate neural network is also
incorporated into the control-loop to perform online learning of uncertain
system model parameters. The resulting control scheme is capable of achieving
efficient offset-free tracking of time-varying references, with a full range of
model uncertainty, without the need for controller structure redesign as the
reference changes. This is a robust approach that can deal with bounded
parametric uncertainties in the process model, which are commonly encountered
in industrial (chemical) processes. This approach also ensures the process
stability during online simultaneous learning and control. Simulation examples

proposed for generating smooth feed rate profile conveniently with the
consideration of both geometric error and kinematic error. First, a
relationship between feed rate value and chord error is applied to determine
the feed rate curve. Then, breaking points, which can split whole curve into
several blocks, can be found out using proposed two step screening method. For
every block, a feed rate profile based on the Sigmoid function is generated.
With the consideration of kinematic limitation and machining efficiency, a
time-optimal feed rate adjustment algorithm is proposed to further adjust feed
rate value at breaking points. After planning feed rate profile for each block,
all blocks feed rate profile will be connected smoothly. The resulting feed
rate profile is more concise compared with the polynomial profile and more
efficient compared with the trigonometric profile. Finally, simulations with
two free-form NURBS curves are conducted and comparison with the sine-curve
method are carried out to verify the feasibility and applicability of the
proposed method.

the link between predictor and response transport maps by moving along

the classical autoregressive models in Euclidean space. Unique stationary

more convenient, but it has also raised many security concerns. Due to the
difficulty of obtaining and emulating IoT firmware, the black-box fuzzing of
IoT devices has become a viable option. However, existing black-box fuzzers
cannot form effective mutation optimization mechanisms to guide their testing
processes, mainly due to the lack of feedback. It is difficult or even
impossible to apply existing grammar-based fuzzing strategies. Therefore, an
efficient fuzzing approach with syntax inference is required in the IoT fuzzing
domain. To address these critical problems, we propose a novel automatic
black-box fuzzing for IoT firmware, termed Snipuzz. Snipuzz runs as a client
communicating with the devices and infers message snippets for mutation based
on the responses. Each snippet refers to a block of consecutive bytes that
reflect the approximate code coverage in fuzzing. This mutation strategy based
on message snippets considerably narrows down the search space to change the
probing messages. We compared Snipuzz with four state-of-the-art IoT fuzzing
approaches, i.e., IoTFuzzer, BooFuzz, Doona, and Nemesys. Snipuzz not only
inherits the advantages of app-based fuzzing (e.g., IoTFuzzer, but also
utilizes communication responses to perform efficient mutation. Furthermore,
Snipuzz is lightweight as its execution does not rely on any prerequisite
operations, such as reverse engineering of apps. We also evaluated Snipuzz on
20 popular real-world IoT devices. Our results show that Snipuzz could identify
5 zero-day vulnerabilities, and 3 of them could be exposed only by Snipuzz. All
the newly discovered vulnerabilities have been confirmed by their vendors.

Most existing approaches focus on learning a graph on which the observed
signals are smooth. However, the learned graph is prone to overfitting, as it
does not take the unobserved signals into account. To address this issue, we
propose a novel graph learning model based on the distributionally robust

a smooth representation of but is also robust against uncertainties in the
observed signals. On the statistics side, we establish out-of-sample
performance guarantees for our proposed model. On the optimization side, we
show that under a mild assumption on the graph signal distribution, our
proposed model admits a smooth non-convex optimization formulation. We then
develop a projected gradient method to tackle this formulation and establish
its convergence guarantees. Our formulation provides a new perspective on
regularization in the graph learning setting. Moreover, extensive numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that our model has
comparable yet more robust performance across different populations of observed
signals than existing non-robust models according to various metrics.

one of the core principles of quantum mechanics, and serves as foundation for
quantum information processing. In particular, the interplay of constructive
and destructive interference with the characteristic exchange statistics of
indistinguishable particles give rise to the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, where
the bunching of bosons can lead to a perfect suppression of two-particle
coincidences between the output ports of a balanced beam splitter. Conversely,
in the case of two fermions, anti-bunching can systematically enhance these
coincidences up to twice the baseline value of distinguishable particles. As
such, the respective emergence of dips or peaks in the HOM experiment may at
first glance appear to be indicative of the bosonic/fermionic nature of the
incident particles. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally that the
two-particle coincidence statistics of two bosons can instead be seamlessly
tuned from the expected case of suppression to substantial enhancement by an
appropriate choice of the observation basis. To this end, our photonic setting
leverages birefringent polarization couplers to selectively introduce
dissipation in the photons polarization degree of freedom. Notably, the
mechanism underpinning this this highly unusual behaviour does not act on the
individual phases accumulated by pairs of particles along specific paths, but
instead allows them to jointly evade losses, while indistinguishable photons
are prevented from being simultaneously detected in orthogonal modes. Our
findings reveal a new approach to harnessing non-Hermitian settings for the
manipulation of multi-particle quantum states and as functional elements in
quantum simulation and information processing.

correlation between BS composition of PV-modules and PV power station
performance by using a combination of lab- and field-imaging, as well as
spectroscopic and electrical characterizations. Using field-suitable
near-infrared absorption (NIRA) spectroscopy, the BS structure of 518
PV-modules, 2.5 percent of the PV-modules in a 5 MWp PV power station, was
identified on-site. The variance of the BS composition was found to be
heterogeneous across PV-modules of the same power class from the same
manufacturer. Polymaide-based BS cause in 10 out of 100 inverters ground
impedance values below 400 kOhm, which is a typical threshold for inverters
connecting to the grid. For primer-based BS this low value is reached 20 times.
We conclude these numbers best as possible from the available monitoring data

identification of degraded primer-based BSs, since visually they look healthy

that a deeper understanding of the relationship between bill-of-materials and

range from $\sim 50$~K to $\sim275$~K. For the upper critical field $H_{C2}\sim
27$~T, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa$ is of the order of $1.7$. This
correlates well with the sharp drop of resistance observed by Hirsch and
Marsiglio at the critical temperature. The strong-coupling scenario for C-S-H
system is also suggested by the high values of $\lambda$ estimated for ${\rm
H_{3}S}$ ($\lambda\sim 2.1$, $\kappa\sim 1.5$), ${\rm LaH_{10}}$ ($\lambda\sim
2.8$-$3.9$, $\kappa\sim 1.6$), and ${\rm YH_{6}}$ ($\lambda\sim 1.7$,

medium (namely a cloud of bubbles in water) is investigated by means of Monte
Carlo simulations. The theory of Gouesbet and Gr\'ehan [Part. Part. Syst.
Charact. 17 213-224 (2000)] is used to derive an energetic model of the
scattering transient. The spreading and extinction of the pulse is decoupled
from the transient of scattering to describe each phenomenon individually. The
transient of scattering is modeled with the Lorenz-Mie Theory, thus also valid
for a relative refractive index lower than one, contrary to the Debye series
expansion which does not converge close to the critical angle. To this aim, the
Scattering Impulse Response Function (SIRF) allows to detect the different
modes of scattering transient in time and direction. The present approach is
more generic and can simulate clouds of air bubbles in water. Two Monte-Carlo
approaches are proposed. The first is a pure Monte Carlo approach where the
delay due to the scattering is randomly drawn at each event, while the second
is based on the transport of the whole scattering signal. They are both
embedded in the Monte Carlo code Scatter3D [JOSA A 24, 2206-2219 (2007)]. Both
models produce equivalent trends and are validated against published numerical
results. They are applied to the multiple scattering of ultra short pulse by a
cloud of bubble in water in the forward direction. The pulse spread due to the
propagation in water is computed for a wide range of traveled distances and
pulse durations, and the optimal pulse duration is given to minimize the pulse
spread at a given distance. The main result is that the scattered photons exit
the turbid medium earlier than the ballistic photons and produce a double peak
related to the refraction in the bubble. This demonstrates the possibility to
develop new diagnostics to characterize dynamic bubbly flows.

Additionally, we take into account for the first time the contribution from the

is overall smaller than the previous estimation by about a factor of 60 at the

  Tasks",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, the robotics community has made substantial progress in
robotic manipulation using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Effectively
learning of long-horizon tasks remains a challenging topic. Typical RL-based
methods approximate long-horizon tasks as Markov decision processes and only
consider current observation (images or other sensor information) as input
state. However, such approximation ignores the fact that skill-sequence also
plays a crucial role in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we take both the
observation and skill sequences into account and propose a
skill-sequence-dependent hierarchical policy for solving a typical long-horizon
task. The proposed policy consists of a high-level skill policy (utilizing
skill sequences) and a low-level parameter policy (responding to observation)
with corresponding training methods, which makes the learning much more
sample-efficient. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that our approach
successfully solves a long-horizon task and is significantly faster than
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the task schema methods.

doing so, the detection accuracy of the warden is expected to be severely

jointly design the optimal selection threshold and message transmission rate
for maximizing covert throughput under the premise that the detection error of
the warden exceeds a certain level. Numerical results are presented to validate
our theoretical analyses. It is shown that the multi-jammer assisted covert

random testing by leveraging properties of the clustering of failure-causing

spreads test cases within a software's input domain. The widely-used
Fixed-Sized-Candidate-Set ART (FSCS-ART) sampling strategy faces a quadratic
time cost, which worsens as the dimensionality of the software input domain
increases. In this paper, we propose an approach based on small world graphs
that can enhance the computational efficiency of FSCS-ART: SWFC-ART. To
efficiently perform nearest neighbor queries for candidate test cases, SWFC-ART
incrementally constructs a hierarchical navigable small world graph for
previously executed, non-failure-causing test cases. Moreover, SWFC-ART has
shown consistency in programs with high dimensional input domains. Our
simulation and empirical studies show that SWFC-ART reduces the computational
overhead of FSCS-ART from quadratic to log-linear order while maintaining the
failure-detection effectiveness of FSCS-ART, and remaining consistent in high

properties. This paper presents for the first time a discretization-free
approach for the formal verification of discrete-time uncertain dynamical

of complex hyperproperties into several verification conditions by exploiting
the automata-based structures corresponding to the complements of the original

proposed deep learning models to aid decision-makers in the traffic control
domain. Although the proposed models have been remarkably improved in recent
years, there are still questions that need to be answered before deploying
models. For example, it is difficult to figure out which models provide
state-of-the-art performance, as recently proposed models have often been
evaluated with different datasets and experiment environments. It is also
difficult to determine which models would work when traffic conditions change
abruptly (e.g., rush hour). In this work, we conduct two experiments to answer
the two questions. In the first experiment, we conduct an experiment with the
state-of-the-art models and the identical public datasets to compare model
performance under a consistent experiment environment. We then extract a set of
temporal regions in the datasets, whose speeds change abruptly and use these
regions to explore model performance with difficult intervals. The experiment
results indicate that Graph-WaveNet and GMAN show better performance in
general. We also find that prediction models tend to have varying performances
with data and intervals, which calls for in-depth analysis of models on
difficult intervals for real-world deployment.

display nontrivial spatial arrangements, such as layered and onion-like
structures, whose composition varies according to the radial distance, and
which so far have been explained on the basis of bulk and surface free-energy
differences between the competing phases. Here we extend the generality of
these non-classical nucleation processes, showing that layered and onion-like

of free-energy differences. We consider two examples of competing crystalline
structures, hcp and fcc forming in hard spheres, relevant for repulsive
colloids and dense liquids, and the cubic and hexagonal diamond forming in
water, relevant also for other group 14 elements such as carbon and silicon. We
introduce a novel structural order parameter that combined with a neural
network classification scheme allows us to study the properties of the growing
nucleus from the early stages of nucleation. We find that small nuclei have
distinct size fluctuations and compositions from the nuclei that emerge from
the growth stage. The transition between these two regimes is characterized by
the formation of onion-like structures, in which the composition changes with
the distance from the center of the nucleus, similarly to what seen in two-step

forensic timelines to support their investigation, which are on average 26%
closer to ground truth.

mounted in the central part of the bottom of the cell for further heating. The
thermocapillary flow resulting from the surface tension gradient, due in turn
to the temperature drop, transfers the particles that were originally at rest
at the bottom of the cell. The effect of the initial thickness of the liquid
layer on the height and base area of the cluster formed in the central region

velocimetry. A model describing the initial stage of the process is developed.
The equations of heat transfer and thermal conductivity are used to define the

simulated using the lubrication approximation. The particle distribution is
modeled using the convection-diffusion equation. The evaporation flux density
is calculated using the Hertz-Knudsen equation. The dependence of the liquid
viscosity on the particle concentration is described by Mooney's formula.
Numerical results show that the liquid film gradually becomes thinner in the
central region, as the surface tension decreases with the increasing
temperature. The liquid flow is directed to the heater near the substrate, and
it transfers the particles to the center of the cell. The volume fraction of
the particles increases over time in this region. The heat flow from the heater

explosions such as type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe I) and broad-lined
type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL). In order to explore the possible link between
these two subclasses of supernovae (SNe), we study the effect of fallback
accretion disk on magnetar evolution and magnetar-powered SNe. In this
scenario, the interaction between a magnetar and a fallback accretion disk
would accelerate the spin of the magnetar in the accretion regime but could
result in substantial spin-down of the magnetars in the propeller regime. Thus,
the initial rotation of the magnetar plays a less significant role in the spin
evolution. Such a magnetar-disk interaction scenario can explain well the light
curves of both SNe Ic-BL and SLSNe I, for which the observed differences are
sensitive to the initial magnetic field of the magnetar and the fallback mass
and timescale for the disk. Compared to the magnetars powering the SNe Ic-BL,
those accounting for more luminous SNe usually maintain faster rotation and
have relatively lower effective magnetic fields around peak time. In addition,
the association between SLSNe I and long gamma-ray bursts, if observed in the
future, could be explained in the context of magnetar-disk system.

computation (MMC) has varieties of applications in the scientific and
engineering community such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbor
classification and biometric identification. However handling these tasks with
large-scale datasets will lead to huge computation beyond resource-constrained
client s computation power. With the rapid development of cloud computing,
outsourcing intensive tasks to cloud server has become a promising method.
While the cloud server is generally out of the control of clients, there are
still many challenges concerned with the privacy security of clients sensitive
data. Motivated by this, Lei et al. presented an efficient encryption scheme
based on random permutation to protect the privacy of client s data in
outsourcing MMC task. Nevertheless, there exists inherent security flaws in
their scheme, revealing the statistic information of zero elements in the
original data thus not satisfying the computational indistinguishability
(IND-ZEA). Aiming to enhance the security of the outsourcing MMC task, we
propose a new encryption scheme based on subtly designed invertible matrix
where the additive perturbation is introduced besides the multiplicative
perturbation. Furthermore, we show that the proposed encryption scheme can be
applied to not only MMC task but also other kinds of outsourced tasks such as
linear regression and principal component analysis. Theoretical analyses and
experiments indicate that our methods are more secure in terms of data privacy,
with comparable performance to the state-of-the-art scheme based on matrix
transformation.

this paper studies the winograd algorithm, which is a widely used fast

Unfortunately, the conventional Winograd algorithm cannot be directly applied

orders of magnitude faster than the existing bisection method. We further show

first objective is to make stochastic predictions of the WHPA within the
Bayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) framework, which aims to find a direct
relationship between predictor and target using machine learning. This
relationship is learned from a small set of training models (400) sampled from
the prior distribution of K. The associated 400 pairs of simulated predictors
and targets are obtained through forward modelling. Newly collected field data
can then be directly used to predict the approximate posterior distribution of
the corresponding WHPA. The uncertainty range of the posterior WHPA
distribution is affected by the number and position of data sources (injection
wells). Our second objective is to extend BEL to identify the optimal design of
data source locations that minimizes the posterior uncertainty of the WHPA.
This can be done explicitly, without averaging or approximating because once
trained, the BEL model allows the computation of the posterior uncertainty
corresponding to any new input data. We use the Modified Hausdorff Distance and
the Structural Similarity index metrics to estimate the posterior uncertainty
range of the WHPA. Increasing the number of injection wells effectively reduces
the derived posterior WHPA uncertainty. Our approach can also estimate which
injection wells are more informative than others, as validated through a k-fold
cross-validation procedure. Overall, the application of BEL to experimental
design makes it possible to identify the data sources maximizing the
information content of any measurement data.

findings of bifurcations linked to complex dynamics in the modified model -
like early afterdepolarisations (EADs), which can be precursors to cardiac
death - predicts the occurrence of the same dynamics in the original model. It
is shown that bifurcations linked to EADs in the modified model accurately
predicts EADs in the original model at the single cell level. Finally, these
bifurcations are linked to cardiac death at the tissue level by example.

rate of this model's parameters is exponentially faster along the directions of

corresponding singular values. We term this convergence pattern the Principal
Components bias (PC-bias). Empirically, we show how the PC-bias streamlines the
order of learning of both linear and non-linear networks, more prominently at
earlier stages of learning. We then compare our results to the simplicity bias,
showing that both biases can be seen independently, and affect the order of
learning in different ways. Finally, we discuss how the PC-bias may explain
some benefits of early stopping and its connection to PCA, and why deep
networks converge more slowly with random labels.

systems, showing as a radial intensity darkening toward the corners of an
image. Since it is a common effect for photography and usually appears as a
slight intensity variation, people usually regard it as a part of a photo and
would not even want to post-process it. Due to this natural advantage, in this
work, we study vignetting from a new viewpoint, i.e., adversarial vignetting
attack (AVA), which aims to embed intentionally misleading information into
vignetting and produce a natural adversarial example without noise patterns.
This example can fool the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) but is imperceptible to humans. To this end, we first propose the
radial-isotropic adversarial vignetting attack (RI-AVA) based on the physical
model of vignetting, where the physical parameters (e.g., illumination factor
and focal length) are tuned through the guidance of target CNN models. To
achieve higher transferability across different CNNs, we further propose
radial-anisotropic adversarial vignetting attack (RA-AVA) by allowing the
effective regions of vignetting to be radial-anisotropic and shape-free.
Moreover, we propose the geometry-aware level-set optimization method to solve
the adversarial vignetting regions and physical parameters jointly. We validate
the proposed methods on three popular datasets, i.e., DEV, CIFAR10, and Tiny
ImageNet, by attacking four CNNs, e.g., ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121,

uncertainty and observation noise in the data. Bayesian neural networks are
theoretically well-founded models that can learn the model uncertainty of their

learning the observation noise for individual samples as well. This paper is
the first to apply these techniques to predictive process monitoring. We found
that they contribute towards more accurate predictions and work quickly.
However, their main benefit resides with the uncertainty estimates themselves

the building of confidence intervals. This leads to many interesting

radiation with a finite detection bandwidth, this frequency dependence causes
an uncertainty in the determination of the polarization angle due to the
limited knowledge of the shape of the source spectrum and detection band. To
mitigate this problem, we propose new designs of the AHWP which eliminate the
frequency dependence of the optic axis over the bandwidth whilst maintaining
high modulation efficiency. We carried out this optimization by tuning the
relative angles among the individual half-wave plates of the five and nine

frequency-independent optic axis over the fractional bandwidth, a bandwidth
over which polarization efficiency is greater than 0.9, of 1.3 and 1.5 for the
five and nine layer AHWPs, respectively. We also study the susceptibility of
the alignment accuracy on the polarization efficiency and the frequency
dependence of the optic axis, which provides a design guidance for each

density. An efficient technique to alleviate this issue is to bring the data
closer to the users by exploiting the caches of edge network nodes, such as
fixed or mobile access points and even user devices. Meanwhile, the fusion of
machine learning and wireless networks offers a viable way for network
optimization as opposed to traditional optimization approaches which incur high
complexity, or fail to provide optimal solutions. Among the various machine
learning categories, reinforcement learning operates in an online and
autonomous manner without relying on large sets of historical data for
training. In this survey, reinforcement learning-aided mobile edge caching is
presented, aiming at highlighting the achieved network gains over conventional
caching approaches. Taking into account the heterogeneity of sixth generation
(6G) networks in various wireless settings, such as fixed, vehicular and flying
networks, learning-aided edge caching is presented, departing from traditional
architectures. Furthermore, a categorization according to the desirable
performance metric, such as spectral, energy and caching efficiency, average
delay, and backhaul and fronthaul offloading is provided. Finally, several open
issues are discussed, targeting to stimulate further interest in this important
research field.

carefully delimit under what settings this new sublinear rate is faster than
the previously known linear rate of convergence of sketch-and-project without
momentum. Secondly, we consider combining the sketch-and-project method with
new modern sketching methods such as the count sketch, subcount sketch (a new
method we propose), and subsampled Hadamard transforms. We show experimentally
that when combined with the sketch-and-project method, the (sub)count sketch is
very effective on sparse data and the standard subsample sketch is effective on
dense data. Indeed, we show that these sketching methods, combined with our new
momentum scheme, result in methods that are competitive even when compared to
the Conjugate Gradient method on real large scale data. On the contrary, we
show the subsampled Hadamard transform does not perform well in this setting,
despite the use of fast Hadamard transforms, and nor do recently proposed
acceleration schemes work well in practice. To support all of our experimental
findings, and invite the community to validate and extend our results, with

Microsoft's Cortana, are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives and
successfully help users in various daily tasks, such as making phone calls or
playing music. Yet, they still struggle with playful utterances, which are not
meant to be interpreted literally. Examples include jokes or absurd requests or
questions such as, ""Are you afraid of the dark?"", ""Who let the dogs out?"", or
""Order a zillion gummy bears"". Today, virtual assistants often return
irrelevant answers to such utterances, except for hard-coded ones addressed by
canned replies.
  To address the challenge of automatically detecting playful utterances, we
first characterize the different types of playful human-virtual assistant

humor and refined by analyzing real-world traffic from Alexa. We then focus on
one node, personification, where users refer to the virtual assistant as a

ability to identify humorous opportunities indeed has the potential to increase
user satisfaction. We hope this work will contribute to the understanding of
the landscape of the problem and inspire novel ideas and techniques towards the

two-particle correlations of combined p-$\phi \oplus \overline{\rm {p}}$-$\phi$
pairs measured in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}~=~13$ TeV by the
ALICE collaboration. The spin-averaged scattering length and effective range of
the p-$\phi$ interaction are extracted from the fully corrected correlation
function employing the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshits approach. In particular, the
imaginary part of the scattering length vanishes within uncertainties,
indicating that inelastic processes do not play a prominent role for the
p-$\phi$ interaction. These data demonstrate that the interaction is dominated
by elastic p-$\phi$ scattering. Furthermore, an analysis employing
phenomenological Gaussian- and Yukawa-type potentials is conducted. Under the
assumption of the latter, the N-$\phi$ coupling constant is found to be
$g_{\rm{N}-\phi} = 0.14\pm 0.03\,(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 0.02\,(\mathrm{syst.})$.
This work provides valuable experimental input to accomplish a self-consistent
description of the N-$\phi$ interaction, which is particularly relevant for the
more fundamental studies on partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear

particle-like which-path distribution can be ascertained. These quantum objects
exhibit both wave and particle properties but exclusively, depending on the way
they are measured. In an equivalent Mach-Zehnder configuration, the object
displays either wave or particle nature in the presence or absence of a
beamsplitter, respectively, that represents the choice of which-measurement.
Wheeler further proposed a gedanken experiment, in which the choice of
which-measurement is delayed, i.e. determined after the object has already
entered the interferometer, so as to exclude the possibility of predicting
which-measurement it will confront. The delayed-choice experiments have enabled
significant demonstrations of genuine two-path duality of different quantum
objects. Recently, a quantum controlled version of delayed-choice was proposed
by Ionicioiu and Terno, by introducing a quantum-controlled beamsplitter that
is in a coherent superposition of presence and absence. It represents a
controllable experiment platform that can not only reveal wave and particle
characters, but also their superposition. Moreover, a quantitative description
of two-slit duality relation was initialized in Wootters and Zurek's seminal
work and formalized by Greenberger,et. al. as D2+V2<=1, where D is the
distinguishability of whichpath information, and V is the contrast visibility
of interference. In this regard, getting which-path information exclusively
reduces the interference visibility, and vice versa. This double-path duality
relation has been tested in pioneer experiments and recently in delayed-choice
measurements.

magnetic fields in different positions. Recently, cryptographic quantum
metrology was investigated where the information of the magnetic fields is
transmitted in a secure way. However, sometimes, the positions where non-zero
magnetic fields are generated could carry important information. Here, we
propose an anonymous quantum sensor where an information of positions having
non-zero magnetic fields is hidden after measuring magnetic fields with a
quantum-sensing network. Suppose that agents are located in different positions
and they have quantum sensors. After the quantum sensors are entangled, the
agents implement quantum sensing that provides a phase information if non-zero
magnetic fields exist, and POVM measurement is performed on quantum sensors.
Importantly, even if the outcomes of the POVM measurement is stolen by an
eavesdropper, information of the positions with non-zero magnetic fields is
still unknown for the eavesdropper in our protocol. In addition, we evaluate
the sensitivity of our proposed quantum sensors by using Fisher information
when there are at most two positions having non-zero magnetic fields. We show
that the sensitivity is finite unless these two (non-zero) magnetic fields have
exactly the same amplitude. Our results pave the way for new applications of

multiple tasks, this paper develops an energy-aware framework for allocating
tasks to robots in an online fashion. With a primary focus on long-duration
autonomy applications, we opt for a survivability-focused approach. Towards
this end, the task prioritization and execution -- through which the allocation
of tasks to robots is effectively realized -- are encoded as constraints within
an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the energy consumed by the robots
at each point in time. In this context, an allocation is interpreted as a
prioritization of a task over all others by each of the robots. Furthermore, we
present a novel framework to represent the heterogeneous capabilities of the
robots, by distinguishing between the features available on the robots, and the
capabilities enabled by these features. By embedding these descriptions within
the optimization problem, we make the framework resilient to situations where
environmental conditions make certain features unsuitable to support a
capability and when component failures on the robots occur. We demonstrate the
efficacy and resilience of the proposed approach in a variety of use-case
scenarios, consisting of simulations and real robot experiments.

components together with their properties and inter-relations. We describe a
model in which meaningful scene structures are extracted from the image by an
iterative process, combining bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) networks,
interacting through a symmetric bi-directional communication between them
(counter-streams structure). The model constructs a scene representation by the
iterative use of three components. The first model component is a BU stream
that extracts selected scene elements, properties and relations. The second
component (cognitive augmentation) augments the extracted visual representation
based on relevant non-visual stored representations. It also provides input to
the third component, the TD stream, in the form of a TD instruction,
instructing the model what task to perform next. The TD stream then guides the
BU visual stream to perform the selected task in the next cycle. During this
process, the visual representations extracted from the image can be combined
with relevant non-visual representations, so that the final scene
representation is based on both visual information extracted from the scene and
relevant stored knowledge of the world. We describe how a sequence of
TD-instructions is used to extract from the scene structures of interest,
including an algorithm to automatically select the next TD-instruction in the
sequence. The extraction process is shown to have favorable properties in terms
of combinatorial generalization, generalizing well to novel scene structures
and new combinations of objects, properties and relations not seen during
training. Finally, we compare the model with relevant aspects of the human
vision, and suggest directions for using the BU-TD scheme for integrating
visual and cognitive components in the process of scene understanding.

to relatively slow camera motions (<1m/s). Under very fast camera motion (e.g.,
3m/s), the reconstruction can easily crumble even for the state-of-the-art
methods. Fast motion brings two challenges to depth fusion: 1) the high
nonlinearity of camera pose optimization due to large inter-frame rotations and
2) the lack of reliably trackable features due to motion blur. We propose to
tackle the difficulties of fast-motion camera tracking in the absence of
inertial measurements using random optimization, in particular, the Particle
Filter Optimization (PFO). To surmount the computation-intensive particle
sampling and update in standard PFO, we propose to accelerate the randomized
search via updating a particle swarm template (PST). PST is a set of particles
pre-sampled uniformly within the unit sphere in the 6D space of camera pose.
Through moving and rescaling the pre-sampled PST guided by swarm intelligence,
our method is able to drive tens of thousands of particles to locate and cover
a good local optimum extremely fast and robustly. The particles, representing
candidate poses, are evaluated with a fitness function defined based on
depth-model conformance. Therefore, our method, being depth-only and
correspondence-free, mitigates the motion blur impediment as ToF-based depths
are often resilient to motion blur. Thanks to the efficient template-based
particle set evolution and the effective fitness function, our method attains
good quality pose tracking under fast camera motion (up to 4m/s) in a realtime
framerate without including loop closure or global pose optimization. Through
extensive evaluations on public datasets of RGB-D sequences, especially on a
newly proposed benchmark of fast camera motion, we demonstrate the significant
advantage of our method over the state of the arts.

  Many-Access Channel","6 pages, 3 figures, Accepted in ISIT-2021",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many-access channel (MnAC) model allows the number of users in the system and
the number of active users to scale as a function of the blocklength and as
such is suited for dynamic communication systems with massive number of users
such as the Internet of Things. Existing MnAC models assume a priori knowledge
of channel gains which is impractical since acquiring Channel State Information
(CSI) for massive number of users can overwhelm the available radio resources.
This paper incorporates Rayleigh fading effects to the MnAC model and derives
an upper bound on the symmetric message-length capacity of the Rayleigh-fading
Gaussian MnAC. Furthermore, a lower bound on the minimum number of channel uses
for discovering the active users is established. In addition, the performance
of Noisy Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (N-COMP) based group testing
(GT) is studied as a practical strategy for active device discovery.
Simulations show that, for a given SNR, as the number of users increase, the
required number of channel uses for N-COMP GT scales approximately the same way
as the lower bound on minimum user identification cost. Moreover, in the low
SNR regime, for sufficiently large population sizes, the number of channel uses
required by N-COMP GT was observed to be within a factor of two of the lower
bound when the expected number of active users scales sub-linearly with the
total population size.

distribution (OOD). The more complex the task to learn, the more likely it is
that statistical artifacts (i.e. selection biases, spurious correlations) are
simpler than the mechanisms to learn. We demonstrate that the simplicity bias
can be mitigated and OOD generalization improved. We train a set of similar
models to fit the data in different ways using a penalty on the alignment of
their input gradients. We show theoretically and empirically that this induces
the learning of more complex predictive patterns. OOD generalization
fundamentally requires information beyond i.i.d. examples, such as multiple
training environments, counterfactual examples, or other side information. Our
approach shows that we can defer this requirement to an independent model
selection stage. We obtain SOTA results in visual recognition on biased data

parameter space. Due to a naturally small mass splitting between the two
neutral scalar components, inelastic scattering processes with nucleons can
occur. We find that for small mass splittings, the model yields very high event
rates. If a detailed analysis at IceCube can exclude these parameter points,
our findings can be translated into a lower limit on one of the scalar
couplings in the model. For larger mass splittings only the elastic case needs
to be considered. We find that in this scenario the XENON1T limits exclude all

promising technique for enhancing the energy efficiency of wireless networks.
Specifically, the IRS enables passive beamsteering by employing many low-cost
individually controllable reflect elements. The resulting change of the channel
state, however, increases both, signal quality and interference at the users.
To counteract this negative side effect, we employ rate splitting (RS), which
inherently is able to mitigate the impact of interference. We facilitate
practical implementation by considering a Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) at
the cost of finite fronthaul-link capacities, which necessitate the allocation
of sensible user-centric clusters to ensure energy-efficient transmissions.
Dynamic methods for RS and the user clustering are proposed to account for the
interdependencies of the individual techniques. Numerical results show that the
dynamic RS method establishes synergistic benefits between RS and the IRS.
Additionally, the dynamic user clustering and the IRS cooperate
synergistically, with a gain of up to 88% when compared to the static scheme.
Interestingly, with an increasing fronthaul capacity, the gain of the dynamic
user clustering decreases, while the gain of the dynamic RS method increases.
Around the resulting intersection, both methods affect the system concurrently,

especially between developed and developing countries. Therefore, from
parliament to social media, the debates and discussions on climate change
gather data from wide-ranging sources essential to the policy design and
implementation. The downside is that we do not currently have the mechanisms to
pool the worldwide dispersed knowledge emerging from the structured and
unstructured data sources.
  The paper thematically discusses how NLP techniques could be employed in
climate policy research and contribute to society's good at large. In
particular, we exemplify symbiosis of NLP and Climate Policy Research via four
methodologies. The first one deals with the major topics related to climate
policy using automated content analysis. We investigate the opinions
(sentiments) of major actors' narratives towards climate policy in the second
methodology. The third technique explores the climate actors' beliefs towards
pro or anti-climate orientation. Finally, we discuss developing a Climate
Knowledge Graph.
  The present theme paper further argues that creating a knowledge platform
would help in the formulation of a holistic climate policy and effective
climate action. Such a knowledge platform would integrate the policy actors'
varied opinions from different social sectors like government, business, civil
society, and the scientific community. The research outcome will add value to
effective climate action because policymakers can make informed decisions by
looking at the diverse public opinion on a comprehensive platform.

health monitoring systems, is the prospect of gaining the ability to make
informed decisions regarding the operation and maintenance of structures and
infrastructure. Unfortunately, descriptive labels for measured data
corresponding to health-state information for the structure of interest are
seldom available prior to the implementation of a monitoring system. This issue
limits the applicability of the traditional supervised and unsupervised
approaches to machine learning in the development of statistical classifiers
for decision-supporting SHM systems.
  The current paper presents a risk-based formulation of active learning, in
which the querying of class-label information is guided by the expected value
of said information for each incipient data point. When applied to structural
health monitoring, the querying of class labels can be mapped onto the
inspection of a structure of interest in order to determine its health state.
In the current paper, the risk-based active learning process is explained and
visualised via a representative numerical example and subsequently applied to
the Z24 Bridge benchmark. The results of the case studies indicate that a
decision-maker's performance can be improved via the risk-based active learning
of a statistical classifier, such that the decision process itself is taken
into account.

The method is based on a time-domain reconstruction of the metric perturbation

idea pursued so far only for bound orbits. The crucial ingredient in this
formulation are certain jump conditions that (each multipole mode of) the Hertz
potential must satisfy along the orbit, in a 1+1-dimensional multipole
reduction of the problem. We obtain a closed-form expression for these jumps,
for an arbitrary geodesic orbit in Schwarzschild spacetime, and present a full

development, and go only as far as calculating the Hertz potential; a
calculation of the self-force and its physical effects on the scatter orbit

analysis to learning from several related and complementary modalities. Most of
these methods work based on two major assumptions: 1) there are the same number

correspondences between modalities are given in advance as prior knowledge.
This work proposes two new multimodal modeling methods. The first method
establishes a general analyzing framework to deal with the multimodal
information problem for heterogeneous data without any specific prior
knowledge. For this purpose, first, we identify the localities of each manifold
by extracting local descriptors via spectral graph wavelet signatures (SGWS).
Then, we propose a manifold regularization framework based on the functional
mapping between SGWS descriptors (FMBSD) for finding the pointwise
correspondences. The second method is a manifold regularized multimodal
classification based on pointwise correspondences (M$^2$CPC) used for the
problem of multiclass classification of multimodal heterogeneous, which the
correspondences between modalities are determined based on the FMBSD method.
The experimental results of evaluating the FMBSD method on three common
cross-modal retrieval datasets and evaluating the (M$^2$CPC) method on three
benchmark multimodal multiclass classification datasets indicate their
effectiveness and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

semantic segmentation. The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results
already, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer
generating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the
impact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for
large models and small patch sizes. Segmenter attains excellent results for

  Matching","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2009.01449",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The prevailing framework for matching multimodal inputs is based on a
two-stage process: 1) detecting proposals with an object detector and 2)
matching text queries with proposals. Existing two-stage solutions mostly focus
on the matching step. In this paper, we argue that these methods overlook an
obvious \emph{mismatch} between the roles of proposals in the two stages: they
generate proposals solely based on the detection confidence (i.e.,
query-agnostic), hoping that the proposals contain all instances mentioned in
the text query (i.e., query-aware). Due to this mismatch, chances are that
proposals relevant to the text query are suppressed during the filtering
process, which in turn bounds the matching performance. To this end, we propose
VL-NMS, which is the first method to yield query-aware proposals at the first
stage. VL-NMS regards all mentioned instances as critical objects, and
introduces a lightweight module to predict a score for aligning each proposal
with a critical object. These scores can guide the NMS operation to filter out
proposals irrelevant to the text query, increasing the recall of critical
objects, resulting in a significantly improved matching performance. Since
VL-NMS is agnostic to the matching step, it can be easily integrated into any
state-of-the-art two-stage matching methods. We validate the effectiveness of
VL-NMS on two multimodal matching tasks, namely referring expression grounding
and image-text matching. Extensive ablation studies on several baselines and
benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of VL-NMS.

aforementioned feature vectors. However, such scheme results in a gap between
training and inference, i.e., the mean feature vectors calculated in inference

structure with the flipping loss to address this issue. More specifically,
models using the FlipReID structure are trained on the original images and the
flipped images simultaneously, and incorporating the flipping loss minimizes
the mean squared error between feature vectors of corresponding image pairs.

map introduced to extend the concept of Hamiltonian actions to the framework of
multisymplectic geometry. Loosely speaking, higher means passing from
considering symplectic 2-form to consider differential forms in higher degrees.
The goal of this thesis is to provide new explicit constructions and concrete
examples related to group actions on multisymplectic manifolds admitting
homotopy comomentum maps.
  The first result is a complete classification of compact group actions on
multisymplectic spheres. The existence of a homotopy comomentum map about the
latter depends on the dimension of the sphere and the transitivity of the group
action. Several concrete examples of such actions are also provided.
  The second novel result is the explicit construction of the higher analogue
of the embedding of the Poisson algebra of a given symplectic manifold into the
corresponding twisted Lie algebroid. It is also proved a compatibility
condition for such embedding for gauge-related multisymplectic manifolds in
presence of a compatible Hamiltonian group action. The latter construction
could play a role in determining the multisymplectic analogue of the geometric
quantization procedure.
  Finally, a concrete construction of a homotopy comomentum map for the action
of the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms on the multisymplectic
3-dimensional Euclidean space is proposed. This map can be naturally related to
hydrodynamics. For instance, it transgresses to the standard hydrodynamical
co-momentum map of Arnold, Marsden and Weinstein and others. A slight
generalization of this construction to a special class of Riemannian manifolds
is also provided. The explicitly constructed homotopy comomentum map can be
also related to knot theory by virtue of the aforementioned hydrodynamical
interpretation.

derived for an arbitrary mechanical subsystem coupled to the harmonic bath of a

Klein-Kramers and Smoluchowski equations, accounting for the effect of the
quantum thermal bath oscillators. The model of Brownian emitters is
theoretically studied and the relevant evolutionary equations for the
probability density are derived. The Schrodinger equation is explained via
collisions of the target point particles with the quantum force carriers,
transmitting the fundamental interactions between the point particles. Thus,
electrons and other point particles are no waves and the wavy chapter of
quantum mechanics originated for the force carriers. A stochastic
Lorentz-Langevin equation is proposed to describe the underlaying Brownian-like
motion of the point particles in quantum mechanics. Considering the Brownian
dynamics in the frames of the Bohmian mechanics, the density functional
Bohm-Langevin equation is proposed, and the relevant Smoluchowski-Bohm equation
is derived. A nonlinear master equation is proposed by proper quantization of
the classical Klein-Kramers equation. Its equilibrium solution in the exact

predator-prey model of plankton dynamics in the presence of a turbulent flow
past an idealized island, to investigate the conditions under which an algal
bloom is observed, and the resulting patchiness of plankton distributions. By
means of direct numerical simulations, we explore the role of the turbulent
intensity and of the island shape. In particular, we focus on population
variance spectra, and on their relation with the statistical features of the
turbulent flow, as well as on the correlation between the spatial distribution
of the planktonic species and velocity field persistent structures. We find
that both the average biomass and local plankton dynamics critically depend on
the relation between advective and biological time scales, confirming and
extending previous results obtained in simpler flow settings. We further
provide evidence that, in the present system, due to local flow action plankton
accumulates in localized filamentary regions. Small turbulent scales are found
to impact the statistics of plankton density fields at very fine scales, but
the main global features of the population dynamics only weakly depend on the
Reynolds number and are also found to be remarkably independent of the
geometrical details of the obstacle.

call $G$ {\it color-balanced} if $m_i(G)=m_j(G)$ for every two colors $i$ and
$j$. Several famous open problems relate to this notion; Ryser's conjecture on
transversals in latin squares, for instance, is equivalent to the statement
that every properly $n$-edge colored complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ has a
color-balanced perfect matching. We contribute some results on the question
posed by Kittipassorn and Sinsap (arXiv:2011.00862v1) whether every $k$-edge
colored color-balanced complete graph $K_{2kn}$ has a color-balanced perfect
matching $M$. For a perfect matching $M$ of $K_{2kn}$, a natural measure for
the total deviation of $M$ from being color-balanced is
$f(M)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^k|m_i(M)-n|$. While not every color-balanced complete
graph $K_{2kn}$ has a color-balanced perfect matching $M$, that is, a perfect
matching with $f(M)=0$, we prove the existence of a perfect matching $M$ with
$f(M)=O\left(k\sqrt{kn\ln(k)}\right)$ for general $k$ and $f(M)\leq 2$ for
$k=3$; the case $k=2$ has already been studied earlier. An attractive feature
of the problem is that it naturally invites the combination of a combinatorial
approach based on counting and local exchange arguments with probabilistic and

extensive emissions of greenhouse gases are found to be the main cause of
global temperature rise as well as climate change. During the last decades
international attention has focused on this issue, as well as on searching for
viable solutions to mitigate global warming. In this context, the pricing of
greenhouse gas emissions turned out to be the most prominent mechanism: First,
to lower the emissions, and second, to capture their external costs. By now,
various carbon dioxide taxes have been adopted by several countries in Europe
and around the world; moreover, the list of these countries is growing.
However, there is no standardized approach and the price for carbon varies
significantly from one country to another. Regionally diversified carbon prices
in turn lead to carbon leakage, which will offset the climate protection goals.
In this paper, a simplified European power system with flexible carbon prices
regarding the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is investigated. A distribution
parameter that quantifies carbon leakage is defined and varied together with
the base carbon price, where the combination of both parameters describes the
spatially resolved price distribution, i.e. the effective carbon pricing among
the European regions. It is shown that inhomogeneous carbon prices will indeed
lead to significant carbon leakage across the continent, and that coal-fired
electricity generation will remain a cheap and therefore major source of power
in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe - representing a potential risk for the
long term decarbonization targets within the European Union.

the strong and Coulomb forces can be observed in kinematic distributions of the
particle pairs. The sensitivity to the interaction potential reaches a maximum
at low relative momentum and vanishing distance between the two particles.
Ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC provide an abundant source of
many hadron species and can be employed as a measurement method of scattering
parameters that is complementary to scattering experiments. This study confirms
that momentum correlations of particles produced in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC
provide an accurate measurement of kaon-proton scattering parameters at low
relative momentum, allowing precise access to the $ {K}^{-} p\rightarrow
{K}^{-} p$ process. This work also validates the femtoscopic measurement in
ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions as an alternative to scattering
experiments and a complementary tool to the study of exotic atoms with
comparable precision. In this work, the first femtoscopic measurement of
momentum correlations of ${K}^{-} p\ ({K}^{+}\overline{p})$ and ${K}^{+}p
({K}^{-}\overline{p})$ pairs in Pb-Pb collisions at centre-of-mass energy per
nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV registered by the ALICE
experiment is reported. The components of the ${K}^{-} p$ complex scattering
length are extracted and found to be $\Re
f_0=-0.91\pm~{0.03}$(stat)$^{+0.17}_{-0.03}$(syst) and $\Im f_0 =
0.92\pm~{0.05}$(stat)$^{+0.12}_{-0.33}$(syst). The results are compared with
chiral effective field theory predictions as well as with existing data from
dedicated scattering and exotic kaonic atom experiments.

two-level atoms (qubits) interacting off-resonance with a single mode radiation
field. The two atoms are coupled to each other through dipole-dipole as well as
Ising interactions. An exact analytic solution for the system dynamics that
spans the entire phase space is provided. We focus on initial states that cause
the system to evolve to entanglement sudden death (ESD) between the two atoms.
We find that combining the Ising and dipole-dipole interactions is very
powerful in controlling the entanglement dynamics and ESD compared with either
one of them separately. Their effects on eliminating ESD may add up
constructively or destructively depending on the type of Ising interaction
(Ferromagnetic or anti-Ferromagnetic), the detuning parameter value, and the
initial state of the system. The asymptotic behavior of the ESD is found to
depend substantially on the initial state of the system, where ESD can be
entirely eliminated by tuning the system parameters except in the case of an
initial correlated Bell state. Interestingly, the entanglement, atomic
population and quantum correlation between the two atoms and the field
synchronize and reach asymptotically quasi-steady dynamic states. Each one of
them ends up as a continuous irregular oscillation, where the collapse periods
vanish, with a limited amplitude and an approximately constant mean value that
depend on the initial state and the system parameters choice. This indicates an
asymptotic continuous exchange of energy (and strong quantum correlation)
between the atoms and the field takes place, accompanied by diminished ESD for
these chosen setups of the system. This system can be realized in spin states
of quantum dots or Rydberg atoms in optical cavities, and superconducting or

glasses age in fundamentally different ways. To address this, we numerically
study the aging dynamics following a quench from high to low temperature for
two-dimensional passive and active Brownian model glass-formers. We find that
aging in active thermal glasses is governed by a time-dependent competition
between thermal and active effects, with an effective temperature that
explicitly evolves with the age of the material. Moreover, unlike passive aging
phenomenology, we find that the degree of dynamic heterogeneity in active aging
systems is relatively small and remarkably constant with age. We conclude that
the often-invoked mapping between an active system and a passive one with a
higher effective temperature rigorously breaks down upon aging, and that the
aging dynamics of thermal active glasses differs in several distinct ways from

actively-explored strategy for reducing pollutant emissions from combustion.
This study investigates the effect of hydrogen enrichment on the unsteady flame
response to perturbations, with a view to understanding the implications for
thermoacoustic stability. The Level Set Approach for kinematically tracking the
flame front was applied to a laminar conical premixed methane / hydrogen / air
flame subjected to 2D incompressible velocity perturbations. For hydrogen
enrichment levels ranging from 0% to 80% by volume, the resulting unsteady heat
release rate of the flame was used to generate the Flame Describing Functions
(FDFs). This was performed across a range of perturbation frequencies and
levels at ambient pressure. The mean heat release rate of the flame was fixed
at $\overline{\dot{Q}} = 2.69\ \textrm{kW}$ and the equivalence ratio was set
to $\varphi=1.08$ for all hydrogen enrichment levels. Hydrogen-enrichment was
found to shift the FDF gain drop-off to higher frequencies, which will increase
propensity to thermoacoustic instability. It also reduced the effective flame
time delay. Sensitivity analyses at $\varphi = 0.8$ revealed that the changes
in FDF were driven predominantly by the flame burning speed, and were
insensitive to changes in Markstein length.

The electrical conductivity, pressure, and the compressibility of the carbon

of DFT-MD point to the existence of carbon in a complex non-uniform

significant amount of attention in recent years. Most of the facial expression
recognition methods have been proposed using mainly 2D images. These methods
suffer from several issues like illumination changes and pose variations.
Moreover, 2D mapping from 3D images may lack some geometric and topological
characteristics of the face. Hence, to overcome this problem, a multi-modal 2D
+ 3D feature-based method is proposed. We extract shallow features from the 3D
images, and deep features using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from the
transformed 2D images. Combining these features into a compact representation
uses covariance matrices as descriptors for both features instead of
single-handedly descriptors. A covariance matrix learning is used as a manifold
layer to reduce the deep covariance matrices size and enhance their
discrimination power while preserving their manifold structure. We then use the
Bag-of-Features (BoF) paradigm to quantize the covariance matrices after
flattening. Accordingly, we obtained two codebooks using shallow and deep

classification performances have been achieved on the BU-3DFE and Bosphorus

the shape and size of the overlap region, which are sensitive to the shape of
colliding atomic nuclei. The Pearson correlation coefficient between $v_2$ and

the prolate deformation $\beta<0$ enhances the value of $\rho_2$. As $\beta>0$

information on the triaxiality of the nucleus. Our study provide further

algebra over $F_2.$ The (mod-2) Lambda algebra, $\Lambda,$ is one of the tools
to describe those mysterious ""Ext-groups"". In addition, the $s$-th algebraic
transfer of William Singer \cite{Singer} is also expected to be a useful tool
in the study of them. This transfer is a homomorphism $Tr_s: F_2
\otimes_{GL_s}P_{\mathscr A}(H_{*}(B\mathbb V_s, F_2))\to {\rm Ext}_{\mathscr

classifying space of $\mathbb V_s,$ while $P_{\mathscr A}(H_{*}(B\mathbb V_s,
F_2))$ means the primitive part of $H_{*}(B\mathbb V_s, F_2)$ under the action
of $\mathscr A.$ It has been shown that $Tr_s$ is highly non-trivial and, more
precisely, that $Tr_s$ is an isomorphism for $s\leq 3.$ In addition, Singer
proved that $Tr_4$ is an isomorphism in some internal degrees. He was also
investigated the image of the fifth transfer by using invariant theory.
  In this note, we use another method to study the image of $Tr_5.$ More
precisely, by direct computations using a representation of $Tr_5$ over the

The simulation results are verified against spatially resolved model

excited states instead of only N$_2$(A$^3{\Sigma}$,B$^3{\Pi}$;v=0) in this

consideration of the aforementioned hypothetical rate coefficient value. It is
found that the contribution of the vibrationally excited nitrogen molecules

higher power. The vibrational distribution functions (VDFs) of O$_2$(v<41) and

this work we provide strong numerical evidence to show that an additional
mechanism that enhances the trapping arises when the noise influences the
energy of the system. For this purpose, we have included a source of Gaussian
white noise in the H\'enon-Heiles system, which is a paradigmatic example of
open Hamiltonian system. For a particular value of the noise intensity, some
trajectories decrease their energy due to the stochastic fluctuations. This
drop in energy allows the particles to spend very long transients in the
scattering region, increasing their average escape times. This result, together
with the previously studied mechanisms, points out the generality of the
noise-enhanced trapping in chaotic scattering problems.

Especially considering today's demand for hardware accelerators for machine
learning algorithms, there is a high demand for an efficient calculation of the
division function, e.g. for averaging operations or the online calculation of
activation functions. For such algorithms, which are often iterative in nature,
one would like to have a non-sequential way of calculating the division
operation. The work presents such an approach especially tailored to FPGAs as
processing platforms. It is based on an efficient way of calculating the
reciprocal operation, based on a low complexity approximation combined with a
correction function. The described approach allows approximating the division
operation (with errors that can be made arbitrarily low), within one clock
cycle using only low hardware requirements. These hardware requirements are
scaleable depending on the desired precision. We show results obtained by
synthesis and hardware simulations demonstrating the low complexity and high
clock speeds achievable with the described method compared to other methods

to the Einstein tensor and the Ricci scalar and the electromagnetic field. Two
black holes were chosen, one with 5-dimensions and z=1 and another with
6-dimensions and $z=0$. The equations of motion for both fields were developed
in general and applied to each black hole mentioned. In some cases exact
solutions of the equations were obtained in terms of hypergeometric functions
and confluent Heun functions. The quasinormal modes (MQN) of evolution of the
analyzed fields were calculated numerically using two different approaches: HH
and AIM. In all the black holes studied the NSM's did not indicate
instabilities neither regarding the couplings nor the space-times. In general,
the quasinormal modes behave like the oscillation modes of a damped harmonic
oscillator, presenting three regimes: underdamped $(\omega_R \neq0, \omega_I
<0) $, critically damped $ (\omega_R=0,\omega_I^{crit} <0) $ and overdamped $
(\omega_R=0,\omega_I <0) $. In the analyzed cases an interesting behavior was
found for $\omega_I $ when $ k \neq0 $ and $ r_+<10 $. In general, $\omega_I $
increase with $k$, but here we find a quadratic growth for $ k\sim r_+$ and
then a decrease when $k>>r_+$. This behavior may be relevant in the context of
gravity/gauge duality. Additionally, we also analyzed the evolution of the same
fields in two black holes with symmetry of Lifshtiz in $ 2 + 1 $ dimensions.

However, it is often not satisfactory to visualize ECG signals in these fixed

from a few specific ECG viewpoints. For the first time, we propose a new
concept, Electrocardio Panorama, which allows visualizing ECG signals from any
queried viewpoints. To build Electrocardio Panorama, we assume that an
underlying electrocardio field exists, representing locations, magnitudes, and
directions of ECG signals. We present a Neural electrocardio field Network
(Nef-Net), which first predicts the electrocardio field representation by using
a sparse set of one or few input ECG views and then synthesizes Electrocardio
Panorama based on the predicted representations. Specially, to better
disentangle electrocardio field information from viewpoint biases, a new
Angular Encoding is proposed to process viewpoint angles. Also, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach called Standin Learning, which helps model
the electrocardio field without direct supervision. Further, with very few
modifications, Nef-Net can also synthesize ECG signals from scratch.
Experiments verify that our Nef-Net performs well on Electrocardio Panorama
synthesis, and outperforms the previous work on the auxiliary tasks (ECG view
transformation and ECG synthesis from scratch). The codes and the division

applications such as image recognition, decision making or recommendation
systems. However, standard NNs are unable to capture their model uncertainty
which is crucial for many safety-critical applications including healthcare and
autonomous vehicles. In comparison, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are able to
express uncertainty in their prediction via a mathematical grounding.
Nevertheless, BNNs have not been as widely used in industrial practice, mainly
because of their expensive computational cost and limited hardware performance.
This work proposes a novel FPGA-based hardware architecture to accelerate BNNs
inferred through Monte Carlo Dropout. Compared with other state-of-the-art BNN
accelerators, the proposed accelerator can achieve up to 4 times higher energy
efficiency and 9 times better compute efficiency. Considering partial Bayesian
inference, an automatic framework is proposed, which explores the trade-off
between hardware and algorithmic performance. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively find the
optimal points in the design space.

e.g., large pose, bad illumination,low resolution, blur and noise. To address
these challenges, previous efforts usually first restore the low-quality faces
to high-quality ones and then perform face recognition. However, most of these
methods are stage-wise, which is sub-optimal and deviates from the reality. In
this paper, we address all these challenges jointly for unconstrained face
recognition. We propose an Multi-Degradation Face Restoration (MDFR) model to
restore frontalized high-quality faces from the given low-quality ones under
arbitrary facial poses, with three distinct novelties. First, MDFR is a
well-designed encoder-decoder architecture which extracts feature
representation from an input face image with arbitrary low-quality factors and
restores it to a high-quality counterpart. Second, MDFR introduces a pose
residual learning strategy along with a 3D-based Pose Normalization Module
(PNM), which can perceive the pose gap between the input initial pose and its
real-frontal pose to guide the face frontalization. Finally, MDFR can generate
frontalized high-quality face images by a single unified network, showing a
strong capability of preserving face identity. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of MDFR over state-of-the-art methods on both face frontalization
and face restoration.

ultra-high computing speed and energy efficiency. We report a novel approach to
ONNs that uses integrated Kerr optical microcombs. This approach is
programmable and scalable and is capable of reaching ultrahigh speeds. We
demonstrate the basic building block ONNs, a single neuron perceptron, by
mapping synapses onto 49 wavelengths to achieve an operating speed of 11.9 x
109 operations per second, or GigaOPS, at 8 bits per operation, which equates
to 95.2 gigabits/s (Gbps). We test the perceptron on handwritten digit
recognition and cancer cell detection, achieving over 90% and 85% accuracy,
respectively. By scaling the perceptron to a deep learning network using off
the shelf telecom technology we can achieve high throughput operation for
matrix multiplication for real-time massive data processing.

Kauffman and Andrea Roli","Beyond the Newtonian Paradigm: A Statistical Mechanics of Emergence",,,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Since Newton, all classical and quantum physics depends upon the ""Newtonian
Paradigm"". Here the relevant variables of the system are identified. The
boundary conditions creating the phase space of all possible values of the
variables are defined. Then, given any initial condition, the differential
equations of motion are integrated to yield an entailed trajectory in the phase
space. It is fundamental to the Newtonian Paradigm that the set of
possibilities that constitute the phase space is always definable and fixed
ahead of time. All of this fails for the diachronic evolution of ever new
adaptations in any biosphere. The central reason is that living cells achieve
Constraint Closure and construct themselves. Living cells, evolving via
heritable variation and Natural selection, adaptively construct new in the
universe possibilities. The new possibilities are opportunities for new
adaptations thereafter seized by heritable variation and Natural Selection.
Surprisingly, we can neither define nor deduce the evolving phase spaces ahead
of time. We can use no mathematics based on Set Theory to do so. These ever-new
adaptations with ever-new relevant variables constitute the ever-changing phase
space of evolving biospheres. Because of this, evolving biospheres are entirely
outside the Newtonian Paradigm. One consequence is that for any universe such
as ours there can be no Final Theory that entails all that comes to exist. The
implications are large. We face a third major transition in science beyond the
Pythagorean dream that ""All is Number"". We must give up deducing the diachronic
evolution of the biosphere. All of physics, classical and quantum, however,
apply to the analysis of existing life, a synchronic analysis. We begin to
better understand the emergent creativity of an evolving biosphere. Thus, we
are on the edge of inventing a physics-like new statistical mechanics of
emergence.

measurements and characterization of traffic flow in high-speed computer
networks of different technologies and coverage levels. This paper presents the
results obtained when applying fractal analysis techniques on a time series
obtained from traffic captures coming from an application server connected to
the Internet through a high-speed link. The results obtained show that traffic
flow in the dedicated high-speed network link have fractal behavior when the
Hurst exponent is in the range of 0.5, 1, the fractal dimension between 1, 1.5,
and the correlation coefficient between -0.5, 0. Based on these results, it is
ideal to characterize both the singularities of the traffic and its
impulsiveness during a fractal analysis of temporal scales. Finally, based on
the results of the time series analyses, the fact that the traffic flows of
current computer networks exhibit fractal behavior with a long-range dependency
is reaffirmed.
